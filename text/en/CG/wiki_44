<text>Choa Chu Kang (), alternatively spelled Chua Chu Kang and often abbreviated as CCK, is a planning area and residential town located at the northwestern point of the West Region of Singapore. The town shares borders with Sungei Kadut to the north, Tengah to the southwest, Bukit Batok to the southeast, Bukit Panjang to the east and the Western Water Catchment to the west. Choa Chu Kang New Town is separated into two portions by the Kranji Expressway.

Originally a kampung, the area has been rapidly developed under the ambition of the Housing and Development Board, to transform it into a modern township. The town comprises seven subzones, five of which are the most densely populated: Choa Chu Kang Central, Choa Chu Kang North, Yew Tee, Teck Whye, and Keat Hong.

==Etymology==
Choa Chu Kang&#x27;s name is derived from its historical core at the former site of Chua Chu Kang Village located near the junction of Choa Chu Kang Road and Jalan Sungei Poyan, currently occupied by the grounds of the National Shooting Centre which comes under the purview of Singapore Shooting Association. The name began to be applied to the general area around the village when Choa Chu Kang Road, a main arterial road linking the village to Upper Bukit Timah Road towards the east was built.

The name &quot;Choa Chu Kang&quot; is derived from the Teochew word &quot;kang chu&quot;. In the nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants planted gambier and pepper along the river banks of Choa Chu Kang, although many migrated to Johor to the north at the encouragement of the Temenggong of Johor. The plantation owners were known as Kangchu - the word &quot;kang&quot; refers to the riverbank and &quot;chu&quot; means &quot;owner&quot; or &quot;master&quot;, referring to the headman in charge of the plantations in the area. &quot;Choa&quot; is the clan name of the first headman.

==History==

===Early history===
Choa Chu Kang was a diverse area with old kampong housing and rubber plantations. Residents had to depend on boats or bullock carts for transportation. Among the few villages which sprang up were Kampong Belimbing and Chua Chu Kang Village. Most of the inhabitants belonged to the Teochew dialect group. The early Teochew settlers were mainly farmers growing gambier and pepper. The Hokkiens, who moved in later, established pineapple, rubber and coconut plantations as well as vegetable farms and poultry farms. In the early days, tigers used to roam in the area. The last tiger of Singapore was shot here in the 1930s.

Kampong Belimbing, Chua Chu Kang Village and Kampong Berih were demolished in phases from 1993 to 1998. It was replaced by the National Shooting Centre and military plot (Cemetery North) and (Jalan Bahar). The Cemetery North has been gazetted as an army restricted and live-firing area since 19 September 2003. The Jalan Bahar is gazetted as an army restricted and live-firing area from 16 March 2001.

The name Choa Chu Kang is used for Choa Chu Kang Road and its nearby facilities. However, the original name Chua Chu Kang is retained in the cemetery area.

===New town era (1980s)===
The new town era evolved in 1985 when Teck Whye was developed (the first HDB blocks since 1977), and it was extended to four neighbourhoods by 1992 with the truncation of Choa Chu Kang Road. Yew Tee was developed in 1997 as the three northern neighbourhoods of Choa Chu Kang, north of the Kranji Expressway.

Choa Chu Kang&#x27;s eighth neighbourhood, Keat Hong, bound to the south by Brickland Road, was developed in 2015.

==Politics==
When Choa Chu Kang Town was developed by expanding Teck Whye Estate near the other end of Choa Chu Kang Road at its junction with Upper Bukit Timah Road and Woodlands Road to the north, the place name began to be applied to a much larger area, especially when political divisions like the Choa Chu Kang ward applied to the entire northwest sector of the country during some editions of the Parliamentary elections. Likewise, the residents&#x27; committees in Choa Chu Kang were expanded in 1988 and 1991, and part of the Choa Chu Kang sector gave way to the Yew Tee division, followed by the Keat Hong division in 2001. The growing demand of Keat Hong Neighbourhood 8 also requested for the redrawing of boundaries whereby Limbang ward took over the parts of Yew Tee and Choa Chu Kang, aligning more closely with Neighbourhoods 5 and 6. Today, the Yew Tee and Limbang wards fall within the Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency and the rest of the town such as Keat Hong and Choa Chu Kang fall within the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency.

In 2020, with the further growth of Keat Hong Neighbourhood 8 and Tengah New Town, the Brickland ward was introduced, taking over parts of Keat Hong, Bukit Gombak, Choa Chu Kang and Nanyang.

==Transportation facilities==
City planners plan for public transport to eventually become the preferred mode of transport in the future. The government of Singapore ideally desires environmental towns, using public transport to reduce pollution caused by heavy road traffic. Choa Chu Kang is part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s focus for realising this urban planning model. As Choa Chu Kang is relatively distant from the city centre at the Central Area, an efficient, high-volume and high-speed public transport system is also preferred over road networks.

Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station and Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange are conveniently connected in the town centre to allow seamless travel for the residents of Choa Chu Kang New Town across the different available modes of public transport.

===Public transport===

====Rail====
Choa Chu Kang New Town is linked to the Central Area and to the other lines on the MRT/LRT system (to the east–west line at Jurong East station, to the Thomson-East Coast line at Woodlands station, to the Circle line at Bishan station, to the Downtown line at Newton station and the North East line at Dhoby Ghaut station) through the North–South Line (NSL) at Choa Chu Kang station (NS4) located at Choa Chu Kang Town Centre. It usually takes an hour for passengers to travel from Choa Chu Kang to the Central Area which changes at Jurong East.

The intra-town Bukit Panjang LRT is a 7.8 km light rail line that serves to link residents to the town centre and the nearby town of Bukit Panjang, hence the line&#x27;s name. It is a fully driverless system.

Yew Tee station (NS5), the other station along NSL in Choa Chu Kang New Town, serves the housing developments in Yew Tee, the industrial estate of Sungei Kadut, and the northern part of Choa Chu Kang New Town. The station started operations on 10 February 1996. Like Choa Chu Kang, it usually takes an hour for passengers to travel from Yew Tee to the Central Area when using the station which changes at Jurong East.

====Bus services====
Bus services are available at the Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange which is connected to the Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station and the town&#x27;s central shopping mall Lot One Shoppers&#x27; Mall. It was opened in 1990 with 12 bus services under SBS Transit and at their own Choa Chu Kang Bus Package, all handed over to SMRT Buses in 1999. On 16 December 2018, the interchange was relocated to a new facility at the junction of Choa Chu Kang Way and Choa Chu Kang Loop, with the old interchange being demolished due to the construction of the Jurong Region Line. All services were amended to the new interchange on that day.

The bus interchange currently has 15 services; 14 are public bus services (mostly operated by SMRT Buses, the other a special free shuttle to Qian Hu Fish Farm. Typically passenger traffic is often very high in morning and evening peak hours.

Bus services were introduced over the years in Choa Chu Kang:
*25 April 2015: Service 983 was introduced from Choa Chu Kang to Keat Hong Close, and extended on 27 December 2015 to Bukit Panjang.

In addition, 300 and 302 were the last bus routes to be converted to use double deckers after the articulated buses starts retiring in 2017.

====Road network====

The Kranji Expressway (KJE) links Choa Chu Kang Town up with Singapore&#x27;s expressway network. With the KJE, drivers can change onto the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) which in turn, is connected to the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) which travels to the Central Area and the eastern parts of Singapore. As the town is surrounded by the towns of Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak and southern Woodlands, many roads (old and new) have been constructed to link Choa Chu Kang into other towns which eventually allows residents to other parts of the country by either bus, train, car or any other reliable means of transportation.

The following roads connect the central town of Choa Chu Kang to the nearby towns of Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang:
* Bukit Batok Road (links Choa Chu Kang with Bukit Batok and Jurong East)
* Choa Chu Kang Road

<text>Justine Elinor Frischmann (born 16 September 1969) is an English artist and retired musician. After forming Suede, she co-founded the Britpop band Elastica before retiring from the music industry and pursuing a career as an artist.

==Early years==
Frischmann was born on 16 September 1969 in Twickenham, England, the daughter of Wilem Frischmann, a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who is the former chairman of the Pell Frischmann company of consulting engineers, and a Russian mother. Her parents are both Jewish. She grew up in Twickenham, Greater London, and attended St Paul&#x27;s Girls School, before studying at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London from 1989 to 1993.

==Career==
===Music===

Frischmann began writing and studying music at age 11.

She was a founding member of the band Suede with Brett Anderson, whom she met at UCL in 1988. She left the band in October 1991. In the 2018 documentary &quot;The Insatiable Ones&quot;, Anderson cites her as a highly significant influence on the band&#x27;s first album.

Frischmann later founded and fronted her own band, Elastica. In 1994, Elastica were voted Best New Band by NME readers at the Brit awards. They were signed to Deceptive Records in the UK, and later with Geffen Records in Europe and the US. Their first album, &quot;Elastica&quot;, released in 1995, became the fastest-selling debut album in UK history. In 1995, Elastica were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for &quot;Elastica&quot;. The album went on to sell over a million copies worldwide. In 2001 the band announced an amicable breakup, citing, in part, burnout from a grueling touring schedule.

Frischmann spent the next few years developing artist M.I.A., whom she discovered. M.I.A. was Frischmann&#x27;s friend and flatmate. Frischmann co-wrote and produced M.I.A.&#x27;s demos for her first album, &quot;Arular&quot;, most notably its 2003 single &quot;Galang&quot;.

In 2017, Rough Trade Records released a remastered version of &quot;Elastica&quot;. In 2019, Rough Trade released a limited edition Elastica BBC sessions album on UK Record Store Day.

===Television===
In 2003, Frischmann co-presented a series called &quot;Dreamspaces&quot; for the BBC Television about modern architecture. In 2004, she presented &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; and was a judge for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture.

===Art===
In 2005, Frischmann moved to Boulder, Colorado, to enroll in a masters program in visual arts at Naropa University, a small, Buddhist-inspired liberal arts college, and &quot;become a nobody&quot;. In 2012 her work was shortlisted for the UK&#x27;s Marmite Prize for painting, and she has been included in The Amsterdam List of 1000 Living Painters.

In a 2016 interview regarding her art career, Frischmann stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t really have any desire to make music, to be honest.&quot;

Frischmann has said, &quot;The themes and ideas I am working with are in direct relation to an ongoing personal narrative; the big questions are reflected in the choices I make in my art ... [including] my ever-evolving relationship with my spiritual faith. I think my approach and aesthetics reveal internal struggles and speak to my family origins and history.&quot;

==Personal life==
Frischmann dated her Suede bandmate Brett Anderson at the time they co-founded the group. She then dated Blur lead singer Damon Albarn from 1991 until the couple broke up in 1998, which served as inspiration for Blur&#x27;s 1999 singles &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot; and &quot;Tender&quot;. 

In 2008, she married Ian Faloona, a professor of meteorology at UC Davis. They live in the North Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>Dita Parlo (born Grethe Gerda Kornstädt or Gerda Olga Justine Kornstädt; 4 September 1908 – 12 December 1971) was a German film actress.

==Early life and career==

Dita Parlo was born on 4 September 1908 in Stettin, Pomerania, then in the German Empire. Sources differ as to whether her birth name was Grethe Gerda Kornstädt or Gerda Olga Justine Kornstädt. Her birth year is also sometimes listed as being 1906.

Parlo made her first film appearance in &quot;Homecoming&quot; (&quot;Heimkehr&quot;) in 1928 and quickly became a popular actress in Germany. During the 1930s she moved easily between German and French films, achieving success in several films, including, in the span of four years, two that are considered among the greatest in cinema history: &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; (1934) and &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937). 

Parlo attempted to establish a career in American films but despite a couple of roles in Hollywood films, was unable to extend her European success. In the late 1930s, she was scheduled to appear in the Orson Welles production of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; for RKO Radio Pictures, but the project was abandoned. 

She was deported to Germany as an enemy alien during World War II, but returned to France in 1949. She made only two films after the war, her final screen appearance being in 1965.

==Personal life and death==
In 1949, she married a Protestant pastor, Franck Gueutal, with whom she remained until her death. She died on 12 December 1971 in Paris, France, although some sources list her death date as 13 December. She is buried at Cimetière Protestant de Montécheroux.

==In popular culture==
Musician Steve Adey has a song called &quot;Dita Parlo&quot; on his 2012 studio album &quot;The Tower of Silence&quot;. The song was written in response to Jean Vigo&#x27;s 1934 film &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot;. Parlo was referenced by Madonna, who said she had been fascinated by Parlo, and took her name for the character she created for her &quot;Sex&quot; book and &quot;Erotica&quot; album. Its title track commences with the line &quot;My name is Dita, I&#x27;ll be your mistress tonight...&quot; Burlesque performer Dita Von Teese took her name in tribute to Parlo.

<text>William John Burchell (23 July 1781 – 23 March 1863) was an English explorer, naturalist, traveller, artist, and author. His thousands of plant specimens, as well as field journals from his South African expedition, are held by Kew Gardens, and his insect collection by the Oxford University Museum.

==Early life and education==
William John Burchell was born in Fulham, London, the son of Matthew Burchell, botanist and owner of Fulham Nursery, and his wife. His father owned nine and a half acres of land adjacent to the gardens of Fulham Palace. Burchell served a botanical apprenticeship at Kew and was elected F.L.S. (Fellow of the Linnaen Society) in 1803. At about this time, he became enamoured of Lucia Green of Fulham, but faced strong disapproval from his parents when he broached the idea of an engagement.

==Career==
On 7 August 1805, Burchell at the age of 24 sailed for St. Helena aboard the East Indiaman intending to set up there as a merchant with a partner from London, William Balcombe (1779-1829). After a year of trading, Burchell did not want to continue and dissolved the partnership. Three months later, he accepted a position as schoolmaster on the island and later as official botanist.

In 1810, he sailed to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa on the recommendation of Gen. J.W. Janssens to explore and to add to his botanical collection. Burchell&#x27;s intended wife had jilted him for the captain of the boat taking her to St. Helena to join him.

Landing at Table Bay on 26 November 1810, after stormy weather had prevented a landing for 13 days, Burchell set about planning an expedition into the interior. He left Cape Town in June 1811.

Burchell travelled in South Africa through 1815, collecting over 50,000 specimens, and covering more than 7000 km, much over unexplored terrain. He described his journey in &quot;Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa&quot;, a two-volume work appearing in 1822 and 1824. (It was reprinted in 1967 by C. Struik of Cape Town.) He is believed to have planned a third volume, since the second ends long before he completed his journey. On 25 August 1815 he sailed from Cape Town with 48 crates of specimens aboard the vessel &quot;Kate,&quot; calling at St. Helena and reaching Fulham on 11 November 1815. Given his experience and knowledge of South Africa, in 1819 Burchell was closely questioned by a select committee of the British House of Commons about the suitability of the area for emigration. The 1820 Settlers went out from England a year later.

He spent time cataloguing and processing his specimens, and raising funds for his next expedition. Burchell travelled in Brazil between 1825 and 1830, again collecting a large number of specimens, including more than 20,000 insects. The journals covering his Brazil expedition are missing, as are his diaries relating to his later travels. His field note books, detailing his plant collections, are held in the collection of Kew Gardens. Historians have used them to reconstruct the latter part of his trip.

Burchell&#x27;s extensive African collections included plants, animal skins, skeletons, insects, seeds, bulbs and fish. After his death, his plant specimens, drawings and manuscripts, both South African and Brazilian, were presented by his sister, Anna Burchell, to Kew Gardens and the insects to Oxford University Museum. He is known for the copious and accurate notes he made to accompany every collected specimen, detailing habit and habitat, as well as the numerous drawings and paintings of landscapes, portraits, costumes, people, animals and plants.

Burchell died in Fulham in 1863, ending his own life by hanging himself in a small outhouse in his garden, after a non-fatal suicide attempt by shooting. He is buried near his home at All Saints Church, Fulham.

==Legacy and honours==
He is commemorated in the monotypic plant genus &quot;Burchellia&quot; R. Br.

Numerous animal species were named for him: Burchell&#x27;s zebra, Burchell&#x27;s coucal, Burchell&#x27;s sandgrouse, Burchell&#x27;s courser, and the &quot;Eciton burchellii&quot; army ant.

A species of African lizard, &quot;Pedioplanis burchelli&quot;, is named in his honour.

<doc id="987959" wikidata="Q1409400" url="?curid=987959" title="Gram matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, the Gram matrix (or Gramian matrix, Gramian) of a set of vectors formula_1 in an inner product space is the Hermitian matrix of inner products, whose entries are given by the inner product formula_2. If the vectors formula_1 are the columns of matrix formula_4 then the Gram matrix is formula_5 in the general case that the vector coordinates are complex numbers, which simplifies to formula_6 for the case that the vector coordinates are real numbers.

An important application is to compute linear independence: a set of vectors are linearly independent if and only if the Gram determinant (the determinant of the Gram matrix) is non-zero.

It is named after Jørgen Pedersen Gram.

==Examples==
For finite-dimensional real vectors in formula_7 with the usual Euclidean dot product, the Gram matrix is formula_8, where formula_9 is a matrix whose columns are the vectors formula_10 and formula_11 is its transpose whose rows are the vectors formula_12. For complex vectors in formula_13, formula_14, where formula_15 is the conjugate transpose of formula_9.

Given square-integrable functions formula_17 on the interval formula_18, the Gram matrix formula_19 is:

: formula_20
where formula_21 is the complex conjugate of formula_22.

For any bilinear form formula_23 on a finite-dimensional vector space over any field we can define a Gram matrix formula_24 attached to a set of vectors formula_25 by formula_26. The matrix will be symmetric if the bilinear form formula_23 is symmetric.

===Applications===
* In Riemannian geometry, given an embedded formula_28-dimensional Riemannian manifold formula_29 and a parametrization formula_30 for the volume form formula_31 on formula_32 induced by the embedding may be computed using the Gramian of the coordinate tangent vectors: formula_33 This generalizes the classical surface integral of a parametrized surface formula_34 for formula_35: formula_36
* If the vectors are centered random variables, the Gramian is approximately proportional to the covariance matrix, with the scaling determined by the number of elements in the vector.
* In quantum chemistry, the Gram matrix of a set of basis vectors is the overlap matrix.
* In control theory (or more generally systems theory), the controllability Gramian and observability Gramian determine properties of a linear system.
* Gramian matrices arise in covariance structure model fitting (see e.g., Jamshidian and Bentler, 1993, Applied Psychological Measurement, Volume 18, pp. 79–94).
* In the finite element method, the Gram matrix arises from approximating a function from a finite dimensional space; the Gram matrix entries are then the inner products of the basis functions of the finite dimensional subspace.
* In machine learning, kernel functions are often represented as Gram matrices. (Also see kernel PCA)
* Since the Gram matrix over the reals is a symmetric matrix, it is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues are non-negative. The diagonalization of the Gram matrix is the singular value decomposition.

==Properties==
===Positive-semidefiniteness===
The Gram matrix is symmetric in the case the inner product is real-valued; it is Hermitian in the general, complex case by definition of an inner product.

The Gram matrix is positive semidefinite, and every positive semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix for some set of vectors. The fact that the Gramian matrix is positive-semidefinite can be seen from the following simple derivation:
: formula_37

The first equality follows from the definition of matrix multiplication, the second and third from the bi-linearity of the inner-product, and the last from the positive definiteness of the inner product.
Note that this also shows that the Gramian matrix is positive definite if and only if the vectors formula_38 are linearly independent (that is, formula_39 for all formula_40).

===Finding a vector realization===

Given any positive semidefinite matrix formula_32, one can decompose it as:
: formula_42,

where formula_43 is the conjugate transpose of formula_23 (or formula_45 in the real case).

Here formula_23 is a formula_47 matrix, where formula_28 is the rank of formula_32. Various ways to obtain such a decomposition include computing the Cholesky decomposition or taking the non-negative square root of formula_32.

The columns formula_51 of formula_23 can be seen as &quot;n&quot; vectors in formula_53 (or &quot;k&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_54, in the real case). Then
: formula_55

where the dot product formula_56 is the usual inner product on formula_53.

Thus a Hermitian matrix formula_32 is positive semidefinite if and only if it is the Gram matrix of some vectors formula_51. Such vectors are called a vector realization of The infinite-dimensional analog of this statement is Mercer&#x27;s theorem.

===Uniqueness of vector realizations===
If formula_32 is the Gram matrix of vectors formula_61 in formula_54 then applying any rotation or reflection of formula_54 (any orthogonal transformation, that is, any Euclidean isometry preserving 0) to the sequence of vectors results in the same Gram matrix. That is, for any formula_64 orthogonal matrix formula_65, the Gram matrix of formula_66 is also 

This is the only way in which two real vector realizations of formula_32 can differ: the vectors formula_61 are unique up to orthogonal transformations. In other words, the dot products formula_69 and formula_70 are equal if and only if some rigid transformation of formula_54 transforms the vectors formula_61 to formula_73 and 0 to 0.

The same holds in the complex case, with unitary transformations in place of orthogonal ones.
That is, if the Gram matrix of vectors formula_25 is equal to the Gram matrix of vectors formula_73 in formula_53 then there is a unitary formula_64 matrix formula_78 (meaning formula_79) such that formula_80 for formula_81.

===Other properties===
* Because formula_82, it is necessarily the case that formula_24 and formula_84 commute. That is, a real or complex Gram matrix formula_24 is also a normal matrix.
* The Gram matrix of any orthonormal basis is the identity matrix. Equivalently, the Gram matrix of the rows or the columns of a real rotation matrix is the identity matrix. Likewise, the Gram matrix of the rows or columns of a unitary matrix is the identity matrix.
* The rank of the Gram matrix of vectors in formula_54 or formula_53 equals the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors.

==Gram determinant==
The Gram determinant or Gramian is the determinant of the Gram matrix:
formula_88

If formula_25 are vectors in formula_90 then it is the square of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of the parallelotope formed by the vectors. In particular, the vectors are linearly independent if and only if the parallelotope has nonzero &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume, if and only if Gram determinant is nonzero, if and only if the Gram matrix is nonsingular. When the determinant and volume are zero. When , this reduces to the standard theorem that the absolute value of the determinant of &quot;n&quot; &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vectors is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume. The Gram determinant is also useful for computing the volume of the simplex formed by the vectors; its volume is .

The Gram determinant can also be expressed in terms of the exterior product of vectors by
:formula_91

The Gram determinant therefore supplies an inner product for the space . If an orthonormal basis &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;, on is given, the vectors 
: formula_92
will constitute an orthonormal basis of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volumes on the space . Then the Gram determinant formula_93 amounts to an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Pythagorean Theorem for the volume of the parallelotope formed by the vectors formula_94 in terms of its projections onto the basis volumes formula_95.

When the vectors formula_96 are defined from the positions of points formula_97 relative to some reference point formula_98,
:formula_99
then the Gram determinant can be written as the difference of two Gram determinants,
:formula_100
where each formula_101 is the corresponding point formula_102 supplemented with the coordinate value of 1 for an formula_103-st dimension. Note that in the common case that , the second term on the right-hand side will be zero.

==Constructing an orthonormal basis==

Given a set of linearly independent vectors formula_104 with Gram matrix formula_24 defined by formula_106, one can construct an orthonormal basis
:formula_107
In matrix notation, formula_108, where formula_78 has orthonormal basis vectors formula_110 and the matrix formula_9 is composed of the given column vectors formula_104.

The matrix formula_113 is guaranteed to exist. Indeed, formula_24 is Hermitian, and so can be decomposed as formula_115 with formula_78 a unitary matrix and formula_117 a real diagonal matrix. Additionally, the formula_118 are linearly independent if and only if formula_24 is positive definite, which implies that the diagonal entries of formula_117 are positive. formula_113 is therefore uniquely defined by formula_122. One can check that these new vectors are orthonormal:
:formula_123
where we used formula_124.

<text>The  (Papal Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls) is a Roman Catholic papal minor basilica and parish church, located in Rome, Italy. The Basilica is one of the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]] and one of the five papal basilicas (former patriarchal basilicas), each of which was assigned to the care of a Latin Church patriarchate. The basilica was assigned to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The basilica is the shrine of the tomb of its namesake, Lawrence (sometimes spelt &quot;Laurence&quot;), one of the first seven deacons of Rome who was martyred in 258. Many other saints and Pope Pius IX are also buried at the Basilica, which is the centre of a large and ancient burial complex.

== History ==

Before the present-day basilica was constructed, the former estate upon which it sits was once home to a small oratory built by Constantine I. The Emperor built the basilica over the site on which tradition held that Saint Lawrence was buried in 258. 

The church was restored or rebuilt by Pope Damasus I, (r. 366-384) who had served there as a deacon.

In the 580s, Pope Pelagius II commissioned the construction of a church over the site in honour of Lawrence. In the 13th century, Pope Honorius III commissioned the construction of another church in front of the older one. Part of the nave and triumphal arch of Honorius&#x27;s church were incorporated, although not perfectly aligned. 

It was adorned with frescos depicting the lives of Lawrence and the first martyred deacon, Stephen, who is interred with Lawrence in the crypt, or confessio, under the high altar. Excavations have revealed several other crypts of various persons, buried below the contemporary street level. Pope Hilarius is also buried here.

The portico () has Cosmatesque decoration by the Vassalletto family of craftsmen.
The 13th-century frescoes, which were reconstructed, depict scenes from the lives of Lawrence and Stephen, both being martyred, young deacons. There are two ancient sarcophagi in the portico: a Christian one, possibly decorated in the 7th century on an older sarcophagus, has a relief depicting putti (cherubs) picking grapes. While vines and grapes are symbols of the Holy Eucharist, these images are probably not symbols thereof. Further, two Romanesque stone lions were moved here from the old entrance.

The campanile was built in the 12th century. Immediately inside the entrance is the tomb of Cardinal Guglielmo Fieschi, who died in 1256, but was entombed in an ancient sarcophagus, itself being incidentally carved with a relief depicting a pagan marital feast.

In 1819, painter J. M. W. Turner visited San Lorenzo, where he made several sketches. 

==Interior==
Inside, the choir enclosure and pulpit have Cosmatesque decoration, and there is also a fine Cosmatesque Paschal candlestick from the 12th or 13th century. The antique Ionic capital on the column directly behind the pulpit has carvings of a frog and a lizard. On the triumphal arch are Byzantine mosaics from the 6th century, depicting Christ with saints. The confessio below the high altar is entered from the nave. Here, Lawrence and Stephen are enshrined. The latter was transferred from Constantinople by Pope Pelagius II during his restoration of the Basilica. Behind the high altar is a papal altar with an inscription of the names of the makers, namely the Cosmati family, and dating it to 1148.

In the chapel of San Tarcisio, at the end of the right nave, is a 1619 &quot;Beheading of the Baptist&quot; by Giovanni Serodine. 

The basilica was home to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem from 1374 to 1847. A restoration was done in the mid-19th century by Virginio Vespignani.

==Reconstruction==
In 1943, the Basilica was bombed by American planes during the Second World War. Restoration continued until 1948, allowing some accretions from the 19th century to be removed. However, the frescoes on the facade were destroyed.

The brick facade was completely rebuilt after the bombings. 

The basilica adjoins a major cemetery and therefore holds a large number of funerals.

<text>Sarai (Turki/Kypchak and Persian: سرای; also transcribed as &quot;Saraj&quot; or &quot;Saray&quot;; &quot;mansion&quot; or &quot;court&quot;) was the name of possibly two cities near the lower Volga, that served successively as the effective capitals of the Cuman–Kipchak Confederation and the Golden Horde, a Turco-Mongol kingdom which ruled much of Northwestern Asia and Eastern Europe, from the 10th through the 14th century. There is considerable disagreement among scholars about the correspondence between specific archaeological sites.

== Old Sarai ==

&quot;Old Sarai&quot; (سرای باتو, &quot;Sarāy-i Bātū&quot;; or سرای برکه, &quot;Sarāy-i Barka&quot;) was established by the Mongol ruler Batu Khan (1227-1255), as indicated by both occasional references to the &quot;Sarai of Batu&quot; (&quot;Sarai Batu&quot;, &quot;Sarāy-i Bātū&quot;) and an explicit statement of the Franciscan William of Rubruck, who visited Batu in 1253 or 1254, on his way to the court of the Great Khan Möngke at Qaraqorum. William&#x27;s statement, &quot;Sarai, the new town that Baatu is making on the Etilia&quot; is considered the first historical reference to the city; a few passages later he refers to the same settlement as &quot;Sarai and the palace of Baatu&quot;. The slightly later Persian historian ʿAṭā Malik Juwaynī describes this settlement as both &quot;camp&quot; (&quot;muḫayyam&quot;) and &quot;city&quot; (&quot;šahr&quot;), reflecting its dual function, gradual development, and perhaps the lifestyle preferences of its various inhabitants.

As the principal seat of Batu, Berke, and their successors, Sarai was effectively the capital of a great empire, although the khan and his court occasionally resided at other sites as well. Various Rus&#x27; princes came to Sarai to pledge allegiance to the Khan and receive his patent of authority (&quot;yarlyk&quot;). In 1261, the city became a seat of the Saray diocese of the Russian Church (Krutitsy), and in 1315 also of a Catholic diocese. It also served, at least occasionally, as the burial site of khans: when he died in 1266, Berke was buried at the &quot;Sarai of Batu&quot;, according to the Ilkhanid vizier Rashīd ad-Dīn Faḍlullāh. Berke had presumably continued the development of the city, promoting the settlement of Muslims and attracting Muslim literati, leading later Muslim accounts to credit him with the foundation of the city; this probably led to references to the &quot;Sarai of Berke&quot;, although it is doubtful that there was ever an entirely separate city called &quot;Sarai of Berke&quot; (&quot;two&quot; cities, &quot;Sarāy-i Bātū&quot; and &quot;Sarāy-i Barka&quot;, are only mentioned by the 15th-century Persian author Muʿīn-ad-Dīn Naṭanzī, who is often confused about the history of the Golden Horde); it certainly cannot be identified with &quot;New Sarai&quot;, which was founded more than six decades after Berke&#x27;s death. The earliest coins struck at Sarai have been identified with issues of Berke from 1264/1265. During the reign of Mengu-Timur Khan silver coins (dirhams) were again struck with the label &quot;Sarai&quot; in 1272/1273; coins of more consistent standard and issue followed under Toqta Khan, especially after 1310.

== New Sarai ==
&quot;New Sarai&quot; (سرای الجدید, &quot;Sarāy al-Jadīd&quot;) is said to have been founded or formally inaugurated by Öz Beg Khan in the first half of the 14th century. The earliest explicit reference to a city bearing this name is the notice of the death of Öz Beg in &quot;New Sarai&quot; in March–April 1341 by a nearly contemporary Mamluk author. A statement of the Timurid historian Ibn ʿArabshāh that &quot;between the building of Sarāy and its devastation there passed sixty-three years&quot; would place the formal founding of &quot;New Saray&quot; 63 lunar years before its sack by Timur in the winter of 1395–1396, and so in 1334–1335. The reasons for the relocation of the capital are unclear, as is how substantial such a relocation actually was (since identifications of sites of &quot;Old Sarai&quot; and &quot;New Sarai&quot; are debated), although it is sometimes assumed that the rationale was a change in the level of the Caspian Sea and the extent of the waterways in the Volga Delta.

Sarai and the other major centers of the Golden Horde (like Gülistan, preferred by Jani Beg) along the lower Volga benefited from trade and exhibited a significant degree of cultural prosperity. While the origin of coins simply labeled &quot;Sarai&quot; remains uncertain, coins labeled &quot;New Sarai&quot; started to be minted from 1342. An astrolabe was discovered during excavations at the site, and the city was home to many poets, most of whom are known only by name. These included Hisām Kātib (c. 1375)and Sayf-i Sarāy, who died in 1396.

This prosperity was rapidly threatened by the onset of chronic political and military instability alongside competition for the throne of the Golden Horde after 1361. As the traditional capital and a rich and prestigious prize, Sarai became the target of most claimants to the throne. The beglerbeg Mamai, for example, took Sarai on behalf of his own puppet khans on four or five separate occasions between 1362 and 1375/1376, losing it to rivals each time. Intervening in the internal conflicts within the Golden Horde, the Central Asian conqueror Timur sacked, leveled, and set on fire Sarai in the winter of 1395–1396. The city had partially recovered by 1402, and by the 1420s minted coins again, although the Golden Horde did not completely stabilize. Shortly after the Russian traveler Afanasy Nikitin passed through in 1469, Sarai was plundered by the &quot;ushkuyniki&quot;, riverine pirates from Vyatka, in 1471. The Muscovite commander Vasily Ivanovich Nozdrovaty Zvenigorodsky and the Crimean prince in Muscovite exile Nur Devlet plundered the &quot;Yurt of Batu&quot; in 1480, in a counterattack ordered by Ivan III of Russia in retaliation for the advance of Khan Aḥmad against Moscow. The decisive blow seems to have been the sacking and burning of Sarai by Khan Meñli I Giray of the Crimea in June 1502. The forces of Ivan IV of Russia passed through and destroyed what was left of Sarai while conquering the Astrakhan Khanate in 1556. After it expanded its control over the lower Volga region, Russia established the new fortress cities of Astrakhan in 1558, and Tsaritsyn (now Volgograd) in 1589.
==Descriptions of Sarai==

The traveler Ibn Baṭṭūṭa, who visited in about 1332, has left a description of Sarai (or, as he called it, &quot;the city of al-Sarā, known also as al-Sarā Baraka, which is the capital of the sultan Ūzbak&quot;). Since the foundation of &quot;New Saray&quot; is estimated to have taken place about this time, it is not entirely clear which Sarai was described by Ibn Baṭṭūṭa; the stated distance of 3 days upstream from Astrakhan (al-Ḥājj Tarkhān) is possibly consistent with the site at Selitrennoe Gorodišče, traditionally identified as &quot;Old Sarai&quot;, but the archaeological excavations of that site might not support this identification.

The Damascene historian Aḥmad ibn Faḍlallāh al-ʿUmarī, who died in 1349, has also left a description of Sarai, based on the account of a traveler; once again, it is not entirely clear whether the information refers to Old Sarai or New Sarai, given its date, and references to both Berke and Öz Beg:

In 1623–1624, a Russian merchant, Fedot Kotov, traveled to Persia via the lower Volga. He described the site of Sarai:
As so often the case, it is difficult to decide to which Sarai (or other center) this description applies.

== Location of Old Sarai and New Sarai ==
The location and identity of the settlement or settlements called Sarai (which means, after all, simply &quot;palace&quot; and moreover seems to function as a synonym of &quot;horde&quot;) have been subject to scholarly disagreement. Arguments have centered on whether or not there were two (or more) capital cities named Sarai and what were their respective locations. One of the influential views that emerged was that &quot;New Sarai&quot; was an enhancement or expansion of &quot;Old Sarai&quot;, rather than a separate settlement. The other view was that &quot;Old Sarai&quot; and &quot;New Sarai&quot; were two separate settlements after all, separated by some distance, with &quot;New Sarai&quot; possibly associated with a satellite settlement called Gülistan. Already in the second half of the 18th and first quarter of the 19th century, Sarai was being sought variously at the large ruin fields of Tsarevskoe gorodishche and Selitrennoe gorodishche, both located (some 250 km apart) on the left bank of the Akhtuba, a left distributary of the Volga, which remain the most impressive archaeological sites in the area.

During the late 19th-late 20th century, the dominant view that resulted from earlier studies, was that &quot;Old Sarai&quot; was founded in the 13th century by Batu and located at Selitrennoe gorodishche (previously also called Dzhigit Hadzhi, just northwest of modern Selitrennoe, about 30 km southeast of Kharabali and about 120 km north from Astrakhan), while &quot;New Sarai&quot; was founded later in the 13th century by Berke and made capital in the early 14th century by Öz Beg, and was located at Tsarevskoe gorodishche (previously also called Tsarevy Pady, , just northwest of modern Tsarev and farther west of Kolobovka, about 55 km east-southeast of Volzhsky). The Selitrennoe gorodishche archaeological site was described as &quot;Gorodishche Selitrennoe ... remains of the Golden Horde capital Sarai-Batu&quot; on the official sign in at the site, while the corresponding sign at the Tsarevskoe gorodishche archaeological site read &quot;Ruins of Sarai-Berke (New Sarai)&quot;.

This apparent certainty was eventually eroded by subsequent scholarship. First, it was noted that &quot;New Sarai&quot; could not be associated with Berke on historical, archaeological, and numismatic grounds, leading to a modification of the reconstruction: &quot;New Sarai&quot; was built by Öz Beg, and both &quot;Sarai Batu&quot; and &quot;Sarai Berke&quot; referred to &quot;Old Sarai&quot;. Second, the analysis of the archaeological remains and distribution of found coins led to the realization that, while Selitrennoe gorodishche matched Sarai (or more specifically &quot;New Sarai&quot;), Tsarevskoe gorodishche did not, and was likely to represent the hitherto unlocated city of Gülistan, which was developed by Jani Beg and rivaled Sarai as a khan&#x27;s residence and mint in the 1350s and 1360s but then declined. This conclusion quickly gained support among the experts, and the present general consensus is that Selitrennoe gorodishche () is &quot;New Sarai&quot;, while Tsarevskoe gorodishche () is Gülistan.

There is currently no consensus on the location and identification of &quot;Old Sarai&quot;. Some scholars suppose that it was a less impressive settlement whose ruins are yet unnoticed or obscured under those of &quot;New Sarai&quot; at Selitrennoe gorodishche, or were destroyed by changing water courses and levels. Others have sought a suitable archaeological site downstream of Selitrennoe gorodishche to identify with &quot;Old Sarai&quot;. Here there are extensive remains of Golden Horde settlements, especially at Aksarayskoe gorodishche (at modern Lapas, medieval Dawlat-Khan), and at Akhtubinskoe gorodishche (at modern Komsomol&#x27;skiy, medieval Ak-Saray). Apart from a tentative suggestion for Vol&#x27;noe 15 km downstream from Selitrennoe, Akhtubinskoe gorodishche at Komsomol&#x27;skiy has also been suggested, and a case has been made for Krasnoyarskoe gorodishche in Krasny Yar, where the necropolis on the neighboring Mayachny hill has yielded some coins from the 13th century.
The question remains open. The account of William of Rubruck (1254) ensures a location for the Sarai of Batu at or slightly above the apex of the Volga Delta, on the left edge of the Volga-Akhtuba river sistem. This is something possibly compatible with Selitrennoe gorodishche, or perhaps rather with a site farther downstream, between it and the apex of the Delta. This is also consistent with the account of Abū al-Fidāʾ (1321), which places Sarai on the Volga only 2 days above the Caspian coast, and with that of Ibn Baṭṭūṭa, who reached Sarai 3 days after (Old) Astrakhan. Pegolotti (writing in 1335–1343) gives a single day&#x27;s journey between Sarai and Astrakhan, while the &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot; cites 2 days for the same journey. Only the account of William of Rubruck refers without any doubt to &quot;Old Sarai&quot;, since it dates to the reign of Batu. If &quot;Old Sarai&quot; and &quot;New Sarai&quot; coexisted for some time at some distance from each other, &quot;Old Sarai&quot; ought to be sought downstream of &quot;New Sarai&quot;. This might be confirmed by a 15th-century map from the Franciscan monastery of Lesina (Hvar), which places Saray (apparently &quot;New Sarai&quot; at Selitrennoe gorodishche) on the Volga, above Dolatcana (Dawlat-Khan, at Aksarayskoe gorodishche/Lapas), above Eschisari (Eski Saray, i.e., &quot;Old Sarai&quot;). One interpretation of the evidence would place Batu&#x27;s original camp on the Akhtuba across from modern Seitovka (and just south from modern Aksaraysky), &quot;Old Sarai&quot; a little upstram at medieval Ak-Saray (Akhtubinskoe gorodishche, Komsomol&#x27;skiy), the major royal necropolis a little upstream at medieval Dawlat-Khan (Aksarayskoe gorodishche, Lapas), and &quot;New Sarai&quot; a little upstream at Selitrennoe gorodishche.

== Little Sarai ==

Sarai Juk (&quot;Sarāyjūq&quot; or &quot;Sarāyčūq&quot; in Perso-Arabic texts, &quot;Sarayçık&quot; in Turkic ones, &quot;Little Sarai&quot;) was a city on the lower Ural River. It is sometimes conflated with the other Sarais in historical and modern accounts, and was once considered a possible location for the capital of the Golden Horde. This town did serve as the main city of the Nogai Horde, one of the successors of the Golden Horde. Although sacked by the Ural Cossacks in 1580, it was later used as the headquarters by some Kazakh khans.

== Sarai-Batu Museum and Tourist Center ==
Located just under 5 km northwest of the border of the archaeological site of Selitrennoe gorodishche (the medieval &quot;New Sarai&quot;) is the &quot;Sarai-Batu&quot; open air museum and tourist center. This was originally built in 2011 as a set for the filming of the 2012 film &quot;The Horde&quot;, and it was also used as the setting for a few scenes in the 2016 series &quot;Sophia&quot;. The sets, built of wood covered with cement and then clay, were recovered with clay again in 2013 in preparation for the continued use of the structures. The sets represent several spaces within the Golden Horde city, combining both attention to reproducing genuine details uncovered by archaeologists and an element of fantasy inspired by medieval and pre-modern settlements in the Eurasian Steppes. They were converted into an open air museum and tourist center at the initiative of the governor of Astrakhan Oblast, Alexander Zhilkin, and opened to visitors in 2018. The center serves as an educational immersive environment, as a location for historical festivals and reenactor events, camel rides, souvenir shopping, and visits to the archaeological site of Selitrennoe gorodishche.

<text>Salvatore Schillaci (; 1 December 1964 – 18 September 2024), commonly known as Totò Schillaci, was an Italian professional footballer who played as a striker. During his club career, he played for Messina (1982–1989), Juventus (1989–1992), Internazionale (1992–1994) and Júbilo Iwata (1994–1997).

At the international level, Schillaci was the surprise star of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, as he helped Italy to a third-place finish on home soil. Coming on as substitute in Italy&#x27;s first game, Schillaci went on to score six goals throughout the World Cup, claiming the Golden Boot as the leading goalscorer, and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament ahead of Lothar Matthäus and Diego Maradona, who placed second and third respectively. That year he also placed second in the 1990 Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind Matthäus.

==Club career==
Born on 1 December 1964 in Palermo, Italy, from a poor family, Schillaci started to play for an amateur team of his native city, &quot;Amat Palermo&quot;, the football team of the local bus company bearing the same name. He then signed in 1982 for the Sicilian club Messina, where he played until 1989 and showed his goal-scoring abilities, most notably winning the Serie B top-scorer award during the 1988–89 Serie B season, with 23 goals. He then joined Turin club Juventus, and made his debut in Serie A on 27 August 1989. Juventus, the &quot;Old Lady&quot; of Italian football, was at the time suffering from the breakup of the wonder team which dominated Italian football in the 1980s, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni; Schillaci&#x27;s arrival coincided with a return to form under the direction of former legendary Juventus goalkeeper Dino Zoff. He featured prominently for the Turinese club that season, scoring 15 league goals and 21 in all competitions in a very positive year, which ended with Juventus winning both the 1989–90 Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup titles. Due to his clever, inventive, and aggressive attacking style, he was then selected by head coach of Italy, Azeglio Vicini, to play in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted by Italy itself, despite being a novice in the arena of national team competitions.

After the end of the 1990 World Cup, Schillaci played two more years for Juventus, alongside his Italy attacking team-mate Roberto Baggio, before joining Internazionale. Schillaci ultimately fell short of the expectations of the Inter fans, as well as those of Juventus, mainly because of the physical troubles which he suffered after the 1990 campaign. In 1994, he joined Japanese club Júbilo Iwata, becoming the first Italian player to play in the J.League, and he won the J.League Division 1 title with the club in 1997. He retired in 1999.

==International career==
Having represented Italy U21, on 31 March 1990, Schillaci made his senior international debut for Italy under manager Azeglio Vicini in a 1–0 friendly away victory over Switzerland, in Basel. He was subsequently called up for Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup that was played on home soil.

At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Schillaci replaced Andrea Carnevale during Italy&#x27;s first match against Austria. He scored the decisive goal as the match ended with a 1–0 win for Italy. Against Czechoslovakia, alongside Roberto Baggio. Italy won 2–0, with Baggio and Schillaci both scoring. Schillaci started alongside Baggio in Italy&#x27;s next two matches of the knock-out stages, also opening the scoring in the round of 16 and quarter-finals, against Uruguay and the Republic of Ireland respectively, and set up Aldo Serena&#x27;s goal against Uruguay.

For the semi-final match against defending champions Argentina, Gianluca Vialli replaced Baggio in the starting line-up, whereas Schillaci kept his place in the team. The match ended 1–1, with Schillaci scoring his fifth goal of the tournament, but Italy were eliminated after a penalty shoot-out, in which he refused to take a penalty, citing injury as his reason.

After setting up Baggio&#x27;s opening goal, Schillaci scored the winning goal in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 win in the third-place match against England from a penalty, and won the Golden Boot, with six goals, as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament. Overall, he scored seven goals in sixteen caps for Italy between 1990 and 1991, scoring his only other goal for Italy in a 2–1 defeat away against Norway, in 1991, in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying match.

==Style of play==
Schillaci was a small, quick, agile, and mobile striker, with an eye for the goal, and solid technique. A prolific, reliable, and opportunistic goalscorer, Schillaci was known in particular for his anticipation, reactions, and his excellent positional sense, which, along with his acceleration, enabled him to make attacking runs to beat opponents to the ball in the area, giving him the reputation for frequently being &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot;. He was capable of finishing well both inside and outside the area, as well as from volleys, with powerful strikes, and was capable of scoring with his head as well as with his feet, despite not being particularly imposing in the air; he was also accurate on set pieces and effective on penalties. Although he was primarily known for his selfish and instinctive style of play, he was also capable of linking-up with and playing off of his team-mates, despite not being a particularly notable passer. Due to his goalscoring exploits, his former Messina manager Francesco Scoglio described him by saying he had &quot;never seen a player who wanted to score as much as him.&quot;

==Retirement==
Schillaci retired in 1999. He returned to his native Palermo, where he owned a youth academy of football.

He appeared as a guest on &quot;Craig Doyle Live&quot; during UEFA Euro 2012. Former South Africa national team captain Steven Pienaar is nicknamed &quot;Schillo&quot; after Schillaci.

==Personal life and death==
Schillaci&#x27;s nephew Francesco Di Mariano and cousin Antonio Maurizio Schillaci have also played professional football. He married twice and had three children. He considered himself Roman Catholic.

Schillaci was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2022. In September 2024, he was hospitalised with an atrial arrhythmia. Schillaci died on the morning of 18 September 2024, at the age of 59. Inter Milan led the tributes to Schillaci stating &quot;He made an entire nation dream during the Magic Nights of Italia 90&quot;.

<text>714 Naval Air Squadron (714 NAS) was a Fleet Air Arm (FAA) naval air squadron of the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy (RN). The unit was initially established as 714 (Catapult) Flight in July 1936. By 1939, it had evolved from a flight into a squadron and was actively operating from the cruisers HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot;, HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot;, and HMS &quot;Manchester&quot; at the onset of the Second World War, utilising Supermarine Walrus aircraft, with RAF Seletar and RAF China Bay serving as its shore bases. In 1940, it was incorporated into 700 Naval Air Squadron. Subsequently, in August 1944, it was reestablished at HMS &quot;Owl&quot;, RNAS Fearn, as a Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Training Squadron, equipped with Fairey Barracuda aircraft. The squadron relocated to HMS &quot;Merganser&quot;, RNAS Rattray, in October and was disbanded nearly one year later, almost to the exact day.

== History ==

=== Catapult flight / squadron (1936-1940) ===

It was first formed as 714 (Catapult) Flight on 15 July 1936, by renumbering 406 (Catapult) Flight, and operated Fairey IIIF floatplanes from cruisers in the East Indies (probably principally 4th Cruiser Squadron). The Fairey IIFs were quickly replaced by Hawker Osprey floatplanes and Supermarine Walrus flying boats, and in 1937 these were supplemented by Fairey Seafox floatplanes. By July 1938 it had consolidated on the Walrus as equipment, and in early 1939 it was upgraded to full squadron status. It was disbanded on 21 January 1940, when all the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s catapult units were merged to form 700 Naval Air Squadron.

=== Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Training squadron (1944-1945) ===

The squadron was reformed on 1 August 1944 at RNAS Fearn (HMS &quot;Owl&quot;) near Tain, Scotland, as an operational training squadron equipped with the Fairey Barracuda. It moved to RNAS Rattray (HMS &quot;Merganser&quot;) near Crimond, Aberdeenshire in October 1944. Its commanding officers included Lieutenant Commander J R Godley, who transferred from the disbanded 835 Naval Air Squadron, taking over in May 1945. The squadron disbanded on 29 October 1945.

<doc id="988000" wikidata="Q5707491" url="?curid=988000" title="Hell-fire trigger">
<text>A hell-fire trigger is a device that allows a semi-automatic firearm to fire at an increased rate. The hell-fire clamps to the trigger guard behind the trigger and presses a &quot;finger&quot; against the back of the trigger to increase the force that returns the trigger to its forward position, effectively decreasing the time required for the trigger to reset, allowing for a faster follow-up shot.

Internally, the firearm is not altered. As in all semi-automatic firearms, only one round is fired with every stroke of the trigger. This makes the &quot;hell-fire trigger&quot; avoid classification as a machine gun within the definitions used by United States federal law, as stated in an ATF private-letter ruling from 1990.

However, as with all private-letter rulings, this determination on the U.S. legality of hell-fire triggers is limited to the facts regarding the specific device being examined. The 1990 opinion may be modified or revoked at any subsequent time by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Furthermore, agency opinion is not always considered legally binding.

During the Waco siege, David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians, reportedly told authorities that he utilized semi-automatic guns with the part installed. Another well-known case of its reported use is the 101 California Street shooting.

<text>Edward Turner Bennett (6 January 1797 – 21 August 1836) was an English zoologist and writer. He was the elder brother of the botanist John Joseph Bennett.
Bennett was born at Hackney and practiced as a surgeon, but his chief pursuit was always zoology. In 1822, he attempted to establish an entomological society, which later became a zoological society in connection with the Linnean Society. This in turn became the starting point of the Zoological Society of London, of which Bennett was Secretary from 1831 to 1836.
His works included &quot;The Tower Menagerie&quot; (1829) and &quot;The Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society&quot; (1831). He also wrote, in conjunction with George Tradescant Lay, the section on Fishes in the &quot;Zoology of Beechey&#x27;s Voyage&quot; (1839).
In 1835, he described a new species of African crocodile, &quot;Mecistops leptorhynchus&quot;, the validity of which was confirmed in 2018.

<doc id="988022" wikidata="Q2279683" url="?curid=988022" title="Elysian Fields (band)">
<text>Elysian Fields is an American band based in Brooklyn, New York, founded in 1995 by the co-composers Jennifer Charles (vocals, instruments) and Oren Bloedow (guitar). Their music has sometimes been described as &quot;noir rock&quot;, due to its sultry, dark and mysterious inflections, be it sonically or lyrically. The band uses mainly acoustic instruments, predominantly guitar, piano, bass and drums, with the occasional appearance of eastern instruments, classical strings, and subtle electronics, the focal point being the voice of Charles in the forefront.

Based in New York City, Elysian Fields have found underground success in the United States but are more popular in Europe. The author of &quot;The Dark Stuff&quot;, Nick Kent, says of their music, &quot;Maybe we have their out-of-the-mainstreamness to thank for a sound that is still unique -- as sensual as a sleepwalker&#x27;s wet dream.&quot; Since its formation, the band has won quite a devoted cult following, largely by word of mouth. Besides its well received albums, the band is also noted for its strong live performances. The rest of the band has included many of New York&#x27;s strongest players: all the members of Jeff Buckley&#x27;s band, members of Medeski Martin and Wood, Ed Pastorini, Ben Perowsky, James Genus, Thomas Bartlett, Jamie Saft and members of Ollabelle have all played in Elysian Fields at various times.

== History ==
Founders Jennifer Charles and Oren Bloedow had in common a mutual love for artists of multiple genres such as The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Captain Beefheart, Ravi Shankar, and classical composers like Frederic Chopin and Olivier Messiaen. Elysian Fields first released an EP in 1996 on Radioactive/Universal Records with cameos from John Lurie and Marc Ribot, which was followed with the critically acclaimed full-length album, &quot;Bleed Your Cedar&quot;. The band then recorded its second album with Steve Albini which was never released because of artistic differences between the band and the record company. Despite their record company&#x27;s urgings, Charles and Bloedow did not want to give the recording a more commercial feel, prompting a split with Radioactive/Universal, who retain the recording. Charles said, &quot;We made our second full length with Steve Albini. It wasn&#x27;t at all what the label was looking for, or wanted. The label wanted us to redo things, go in with more commercial people, and give them songs that they could sell. I didn&#x27;t want to mess with what we made with Steve. It was what it was. In the end we agreed to disagree, I asked to be released from my contract, and we parted ways. For now it sits in some vault gathering dust, I suppose.&quot; (Entitled &quot;Clinical Trial&quot;, the album was eventually released on the band&#x27;s bandcamp page in 2014.)

In 2000, the band recorded a one-off album for Jetset records, &quot;Queen of the Meadow&quot;, which the band toured extensively in Europe, and which reached number 5 on the CMJ charts in the US. Robert Wilson went on to use one of the songs, &quot;Rope of Weeds&quot;, in one of his plays. In June 2003, the band released &quot;Dreams That Breathe Your Name&quot; in France and Benelux on PIAS and Bang Records respectively, followed by an American release in 2004 on their own label Diluvian. The album was called &quot;Close to noir-rock perfection&quot; by the &quot;TimeoutNY&quot; music editor, Mike Wolf.

A further album, &quot;Bum Raps and Love Taps&quot;, was released in Europe in late 2005/early 2006 on the Naive label and led to the band touring in Europe for much of 2005 and 2006. The album is dedicated to Charles&#x27; grandmother, about whom the title track was written. Another song &quot;&#x27;Duel with Cudgels&quot;, eight minutes and thirty seconds, takes its title from a Goya painting. Their music is lush and melancholy, with poetic and sometimes surreal lyrics. Their &quot;Bum Raps&quot; album was finally released in the US in late 2008 on the band&#x27;s Diluvian imprint.

In addition to contributing to many of John Zorn&#x27;s produced compilation records, including one of Marc Bolan and the first track on the Serge Gainsbourg tribute, Charles and Bloedow also released two complete albums of Sephardic songs on Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik label: &quot;La Mar Enfortuna&quot; (2001) and &quot;Convivencia&quot; (2007). They give ancient Moorish melodies a revamp with their signature Elysian Fields sound. Charles sings in Ladino as well as in Arabic, Aramaic, Spanish and Greek on these albums. Elysian Fields have also performed in several tribute concerts produced by the impresario Hal Willner, including one of Randy Newman&#x27;s songs in Los Angeles, where Oren was a musical director, and another for Edgar Allan Poe. Elysian Fields performed at the Carnegie Hall on April 5, 2007, in Michael Dorf&#x27;s all star tribute to Bruce Springsteen; Oren was once again musical director, backing up several artists including Badly Drawn Boy, and Bruce Springsteen himself for the rousing finale of &quot;Rosalita&quot;. Elysian Fields rendition of &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was noted in both &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as being one of the show&#x27;s highlights, and described as &quot;sensual&quot; and &quot;passionate&quot;. In February 2009, Elysian Fields performed in Paris in a sold-out show at the Salle Pleyel, as part of John Zorn&#x27;s Serge Gainsbourg tribute concert alongside Marc Ribot and Sean Lennon.

In 2009, the band released &quot;The Afterlife&quot; on Vicious Circle records, which was received with high critical praise. European tours followed,
along with sold-out concerts in several major cities.

According to the liner notes, their 2020 album &quot;Transience of Life&quot; was inspired by the 18th-century Chinese novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; by Cao Xueqin.

Elysian Fields&#x27; music has appeared in films as well as many television shows including &quot;Damages&quot;, &quot;Conviction&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot; and &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;. &quot;Black acres&quot; from &quot;Queen of the Meadow&quot; was used in a 2011 Lavazza advertisement.

==Influences==
Jennifer Charles cited singers of many styles including Anita O&#x27;Day, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and Blues singers. She&#x27;s also been inspired by the likes of the Lounge Lizards, Nick Cave, Lydia Lunch, Foetus, Siouxsie, Jean-Louis Murat and The Captain.

<text>Colleen Moore (born Kathleen Morrison; August 19, 1899 – January 25, 1988) was an American film actress who began her career during the silent film era. Moore became one of the most fashionable (and highly-paid) stars of the era and helped popularize the bobbed haircut.

Although Moore was a huge star in her day, approximately half of her films are now considered lost, including her first talking picture from 1929. What was perhaps her most celebrated film, &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; (1923), is now mostly lost as well, with only one reel surviving.

Moore took a hiatus from acting between 1929 and 1933, just as sound was being added to motion pictures. After she returned, her four sound pictures released in 1933 and 1934 were not financial successes. She then retired permanently from screen acting.

After her film career, Moore maintained her wealth through astute investments, becoming a partner of Merrill Lynch. She later wrote a &quot;how-to&quot; book about investing in the stock market.

Moore also nurtured a passion for dollhouses throughout her life and helped design and curate The Colleen Moore Dollhouse, which has been a featured exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago since the early 1950s. The dollhouse, measuring , was estimated in 1985 to be worth $7 million, and it is seen by 1.5 million people annually.

==Early life==
Moore was born Kathleen Morrison on August 19, 1899, (according to the bulk of the official records; the date which she insisted was correct in her autobiography, &quot;Silent Star&quot;, was 1902) in Port Huron, Michigan, Moore was the eldest child of Charles R. and Agnes Kelly Morrison. The family remained in Port Huron during the early years of Moore&#x27;s life, at first living with her grandmother Mary Kelly (often spelled Kelley) and then with at least one of Moore&#x27;s aunts.

By 1905, the family moved to Hillsdale, Michigan, where they remained for over two years. They relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, by 1908. They are listed at three different addresses during their stay in Atlanta (From the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library city directories): 301 Capitol Avenue − 1908; 41 Linden Avenue – 1909; 240 N. Jackson Street – 1910. They then lived briefly — probably for less than a year — in Warren, Pennsylvania, and by 1911, they had settled in Tampa, Florida.

At the age of 15 she took her first step into Hollywood. Her uncle arranged a screen test with director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish but instead, she found herself playing heroines in Westerns with stars such as Tom Mix.

Two of Moore&#x27;s great passions were dolls and movies; each would play a great role in her later life. She and her brother began their own stock company, reputedly performing on a stage created from a piano packing crate. Her aunts, who doted on her, indulged her other great passion and often bought her miniature furniture on their many trips, with which she furnished the first of a succession of dollhouses. Moore&#x27;s family summered in Chicago, where she enjoyed baseball and the company of her Aunt Lib (Elizabeth, who changed her name to &quot;Liberty&quot;, Lib for short) and Lib&#x27;s husband Walter Howey. Howey was the managing editor of the &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot; and an important newspaper editor in the publishing empire of William Randolph Hearst, and was the inspiration for Walter Burns, the fictional Chicago newspaper editor in the play and the film &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

==Career==

===Early years===
Essanay Studios was within walking distance of the Northwestern L, which ran right past the Howey residence. (They occupied at least two residences between 1910 and 1916: 4161 Sheridan and 4942 Sheridan.) In interviews later in her silent film career, Moore claimed she had appeared in the background of several Essanay films, usually as a face in a crowd. One story has it that she got into the Essanay studios and waited in line to be an extra with Helen Ferguson: in an interview with Kevin Brownlow many years later, Ferguson told a story that substantially confirmed many details of the claim, though it is not certain whether she was referring to Moore&#x27;s stints as a background extra (if she really was one) or to her film test there prior to her departure for Hollywood in November 1917. Film producer D. W. Griffith was in debt to Howey, who had helped him to get both &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Intolerance&quot; through the Chicago censorship board.

The contract to Griffith&#x27;s Triangle-Fine Arts was conditional on passing a film test to ensure that her heterochromia (she had one brown eye, one blue eye) would not be a distraction in close-up shots. Her eyes passed the test, so she left for Hollywood with her grandmother and her mother as chaperones. Moore made her first credited film appearance in 1917 in &quot;The Bad Boy&quot; for Triangle Fine Arts, and for the next few years appeared in small, supporting roles gradually attracting the attention of the public.

&quot;The Bad Boy&quot; was released on February 18, and featured Robert Harron, Richard Cummings, Josephine Crowell, and Mildred Harris (who would later become Charles Chaplin&#x27;s first wife). Two months later, it was followed by &quot;An Old-Fashioned Young Man&quot;, again with Robert Harron. Moore&#x27;s third film was &quot;Hands Up!&quot; filmed in part in the vicinity of the Seven Oaks (a popular location for productions that required dramatic vistas). This was her first true western. The film&#x27;s scenario was written by Wilfred Lucas from a story by Al Jennings, the famous outlaw who had been freed from jail by presidential pardon by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907. Monte Blue was in the cast and noticed Moore could not mount her horse, though horseback riding was required for the part (during casting for the part she neglected to mention she did not know how to ride). Blue gave her a quick lesson essentially consisting of how to mount the horse and how to hold on.

On May 3, 1917, the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; said: &quot;Colleen Moore contributes some remarkable bits of acting. She is very sweet as she goes trustingly to her bandit hero, and, O, so pitiful, when finally realizing the character of the man, she goes into a hysteria of terror, and, shrieking &#x27;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!&#x27; beats futilely on a bolted door, a panic-stricken little human animal, who had not known before that there was aught but kindness in the world.&quot; About the time her first six-month contract was extended an additional six months, she requested and received five weeks&#x27; release to do a film for Universal&#x27;s Bluebird division, released under the name &quot;The Savage&quot;. This was her fourth film, and she was only needed for two weeks. Upon her return to the Fine Arts lot, she spent several weeks trying to get her pay for the three weeks she had been available for work for Triangle (finally receiving it in December of that year).

Soon after, the Triangle Company went bust, and while her contract was honored, she found herself scrambling to find her next job. With a reel of her performance in &quot;Hands Up!&quot; under her arm, Colin Campbell arranged for her to get a contract with Selig Polyscope. She was very likely at work on &quot;A Hoosier Romance&quot; before &quot;The Savage&quot; was released in November. After &quot;A Hoosier Romance&quot;, she went to work on &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. Both films were based upon poems by James Whitcomb Riley, and both proved to be very popular. It was her first real taste of popularity.

&quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot; was released in December. The &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; wrote of Moore, &quot;She was a lovely and unspoiled child the last time I saw her. Let&#x27;s hope commendation hasn&#x27;t turned her head.&quot; Despite her good notices, her luck took a turn for the worse when Selig Polyscope went bust. Once again Moore found herself unemployed, but she had begun to make a name for herself by 1919. She had a series of films lined up. She went to Flagstaff, Arizona, for location work on &quot;The Wilderness Trail&quot;, another western, this time with Tom Mix. Her mother went along as a chaperone. Moore wrote that while she had a crush on Mix, he only had eyes for her mother. &quot;The Wilderness Trail&quot; was a Fox Film Corporation production, and while it had started production earlier, it would not be released until after &quot;The Busher&quot;, which was released on May 18. &quot;The Busher&quot; was an H. Ince Productions-Famous Players–Lasky production; it was a baseball film whose hero was played by Charles Ray. &quot;The Wilderness Trail&quot; followed on July 6, another Fox film. &quot;The Man in the Moonlight&quot;, a Universal Film Manufacturing Company film, was released a few weeks later on July 28. &quot;The Egg Crate Wallop&quot; was a Famous Players–Lasky production released by Paramount Pictures on September 28.
===Success===
The next stage of her career was with the Christie Film Company, a move she made when she decided she needed comic training. While with Christie she made &quot;Her Bridal Nightmare&quot;, &quot;A Roman Scandal&quot;, and &quot;So Long Letty&quot;. At the same time as she was working on these films, she worked on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Claim&quot; with Sessue Hayakawa (in which she played a Persian woman), &quot;When Dawn Came&quot;, and &quot;His Nibs&quot; (1921) with Chic Sale. All the while, Marshall Neilan had been attempting to get Moore released from her contract so she could work for him. He was successful and made &quot;Dinty&quot; with Moore, releasing near the end of 1920, followed by &quot;When Dawn Came&quot;.
For all his efforts to win Moore away from Christie, it seems Neilan loaned Moore to other studios most of the time. He loaned her out to King Vidor for &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot;, released in May 1921, yet another Western. After working on &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot; on location in the snows of Truckee, she was off to Catalina Island for work on &quot;The Lotus Eater&quot; with John Barrymore. In October 1921, &quot;His Nibs&quot; was released, her only film to be released that year besides &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot;. In &quot;His Nibs&quot;, Moore actually appeared in a film within the film; the framing film was a comedy vehicle for Chic Sales. The film it framed was a spoof on films of the time. 1922 proved to be an eventful year for Moore; she was named a WAMPAS Baby Star during a &quot;frolic&quot; at the Ambassador Hotel which became an annual event, in recognition of her growing popularity. In early 1922, &quot;Come On Over&quot; was released, made from a Rupert Hughes story and directed by Alfred E. Green. Hughes directed Moore himself in &quot;The Wallflower&quot;, released that same year. In addition, Neilan introduced her to John McCormick, a publicist who had had his eye on Moore ever since he had first seen her photograph. He had prodded Marshall into an introduction. The two hit it off, and before long they were engaged. By the end of that year, three more of her films were released: &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot;, &quot;The Ninety and Nine&quot;, and &quot;Broken Chains&quot;.

&quot;Look Your Best&quot; and &quot;The Nth Commandment&quot; were released in early 1923, followed by two Cosmopolitan Productions, &quot;The Nth Commandment&quot; and &quot;Through the Dark.&quot; By this time, Moore had publicly confirmed her engagement to McCormick, a fact that she had been coy about to the press previously. Before mid-year, she had signed a contract with First National Pictures, and her first two films were slated to be &quot;The Huntress&quot; and &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;. &quot;Slippy McGee&quot; came out in June, followed by &quot;Broken Hearts of Broadway&quot;.

Moore and John McCormick married while &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; was still in production, and just before the release of &quot;The Savage&quot;. When it was finally released in 1923, &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;, in which she starred opposite actor Milton Sills, was a hit. The controversial story put Moore in focus as a flapper, but after Clara Bow took the stage in &quot;Black Oxen&quot; in December, she gradually lost her momentum. In spring 1924 she made a good but unsuccessful effort to top Bow in &quot;The Perfect Flapper&quot;, and soon after she dismissed the whole flapper vogue; &quot;No more flappers...people are tired of soda-pop love affairs.&quot; Decades later Moore stated Bow was her &quot;chief rival.&quot;

&quot;Through the Dark&quot;, originally shot under the name &quot;Daughter of Mother McGinn&quot;, was released during the height of the &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; furor in January 1924. Three weeks later, &quot;Painted People&quot; was released. After that, she was to star in &quot;Counterfeit&quot;. The film went through a number of title changes before being released as &quot;Flirting with Love&quot; in August. In October, First National purchased the rights to &quot;Sally&quot; for Moore&#x27;s next film. It would be a challenge, as &quot;Sally&quot; was a musical comedy. In December, First National purchased the rights to &quot;Desert Flower&quot; and in so doing had mapped out Moore&#x27;s schedule for 1925: &quot;Sally&quot; would be filmed first, followed by &quot;The Desert Flower&quot;.

By the late 1920s, she had accomplished dramatic roles in films such as &quot;So Big&quot;, where Moore aged through a stretch of decades, and was also well received in light comedies such as &quot;Irene&quot;. An overseas tour was planned to coincide with the release of &quot;So Big&quot; in Europe, and Moore saw the tour as her first real opportunity to spend time with her husband, John McCormick. Both she and John McCormick were dedicated to their careers, and their hectic schedules had kept them from spending any quality time together. Moore wanted a family; it was one of her goals.

Plans for the trip were put in jeopardy when she injured her neck during the filming of &quot;The Desert Flower&quot;. Her injury forced the production to shut down while Moore spent six weeks in a body cast in bed. Once out of the cast, she completed the film and left for Europe on a triumphal tour. When she returned, she negotiated a new contract with First National. Her films had been great hits, so her terms were very generous. Her first film upon her return to the States was &quot;We Moderns&quot;, set in England with location work done in London during the tour. It was a comedy, essentially a retelling of &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; from an English perspective. This was followed by &quot;Irene&quot; (another musical in the style of the very popular &quot;Sally&quot;) and &quot;Ella Cinders&quot;, a straight comedy that featured a cameo appearance by comedian Harry Langdon. &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; was a romantic comedy with dramatic undertones, and it was followed by &quot;Twinkletoes&quot;, a dramatic film that featured Moore as a young dancer in London&#x27;s Limehouse district during the previous century. &quot;Orchids and Ermine&quot; was released in 1927, filmed in part in New York, a thinly veiled Cinderella story.

In 1927, Moore split from her studio after her husband suddenly quit. It is rumored that John McCormick was about to be fired for his drinking and that she left as a means of leveraging her husband back into a position at First National. It worked, and McCormick found himself as Moore&#x27;s sole producer. Moore&#x27;s popularity allowed her productions to become very large and lavish. &quot;Lilac Time&quot; was one of the bigger productions of the era, a World War I drama. A million dollar film, it made back every penny spent within months. Prior to its release, Warner Bros. had taken control of First National and were less than interested in maintaining the terms of her contract until the numbers started to roll in for &quot;Lilac Time&quot;. The film was such a hit that Moore managed to retain generous terms in her next contract and her husband as her producer.

===Colleen Moore Fairy Castle (Dollhouse)===
In 1928, inspired by her father and with help from her former set designer, a dollhouse was constructed by her father, which was 9 square feet with the tallest tower 12 feet high. The interior of The Colleen Moore Dollhouse, designed by Harold Grieve, features miniature bear skin rugs and detailed furniture and art. Moore&#x27;s dollhouse has been a featured exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago since October 30, 1949, where, according to the museum, it is seen by 1.5 million people each year and would be worth $7 million. Moore continued working on it and contributing artifacts to it until her death.

This dollhouse was the eighth one Moore owned. The first dollhouse, she wrote in her autobiography &quot;Silent Star&quot; (1968), evolved from a cabinet that held her collection of miniature furniture. It was supposedly built from a cigar box. Kitty Lorgnette wrote in the edition of &quot;The Evening News&quot; (Tampa, Florida) for Saturday, August 13, 1938, that the first dollhouse was purchased by Oraleze O&#x27;Brien (Mrs. Frank J. Knight) in 1916 when Moore (then Kathleen) left Tampa. Oraleze was too big for dollhouses, however, and she sold it again after her cat had kittens in it, and from there she lost track of it. The third house was possibly given to the daughter of Moore&#x27;s good friend, author Adela Rogers St. Johns. The fourth survives and remains on display in the living room of a relative.

===Sound films===
With the advent of talking pictures in 1929, Moore took a hiatus from acting. After divorcing McCormick in 1930, Moore married prominent New York-based stockbroker Albert Parker Scott in 1932. The couple lived at that time in a lavish home at 345 St. Pierre Road in Bel Air, where they hosted parties for and were supporters of the U.S. Olympic team, especially the yachting team, during the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.

In 1934, Moore, by then divorced from Albert Parker Scott, returned to work in Hollywood. She appeared in three films, none of which was successful, and Moore retired. Her last film was a version of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; in 1934. She later married the widower Homer Hargrave and raised his children (she never had children of her own) from a previous marriage, with whom she maintained a lifelong close relationship. Throughout her life she also maintained close friendships with other colleagues from the silent film era, such as King Vidor and Mary Pickford.

==Later years==
In the 1960s, Moore formed a television production company with King Vidor, with whom she had worked in the 1920s. She published two books in the late 1960s, &quot;How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market&quot; (1969) and her autobiography, &quot;Silent Star: Colleen Moore Talks About Her Hollywood&quot; (1968). She also figures prominently alongside Vidor in Sidney D. Kirkpatrick&#x27;s book, &quot;A Cast of Killers&quot;, which recounts Vidor&#x27;s attempt to make a film of and solve the murder of William Desmond Taylor. In that book she is recalled as having been a successful real estate broker in Chicago and partner in the investment firm Merrill Lynch after her film career. 

At the height of her fame, Moore was earning $12,500 per week. She was an astute investor, and through her investments, remained wealthy for the rest of her life. In her later years she would frequently attend film festivals, and was a popular interview subject always willing to discuss her Hollywood career. She was a participant in the documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), providing her recollections of Hollywood&#x27;s silent film era.

==Personal life==
Moore was married four times. Her first marriage was to John McCormick of First National Studios. They married in 1923 and divorced in 1930. In 1932, Moore married stockbroker Albert P. Scott. The union ended in divorce in 1934. Moore&#x27;s third marriage was to another stockboker, Homer Hargrave, whom she married in 1936. He provided funding for her dollhouse and she adopted his son, Homer Hargrave, Jr, and his daughter, Judy Hargrave. The couple remained married until Hargrave&#x27;s death in 1964. In 1982, she married builder Paul Magenot, and they remained together until Moore&#x27;s death in 1988.

==Death and legacy==
On January 25, 1988, Moore died at age 88 from cancer in Paso Robles, California. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Colleen Moore has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1551 Vine Street.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of her: &quot;I was the spark that lit up &quot;Flaming Youth,&quot; Colleen Moore was the torch. What little things we are to have caused all that trouble.&quot;

He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions and was selected with the second overall pick by the Washington Redskins of the 2000 NFL draft. He was also a member of the New York Giants.

==Early life==
Arrington was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He played linebacker and running back at North Hills Senior High School in Pittsburgh. After his senior year, he was named the 1996 &quot;Parade&quot; National Player of the Year, Bobby Dodd National High School Back of the Year the Gatorade Player of the Year and &quot;USA Today&quot; Pennsylvania Player of the Year. He became the second player in Pennsylvania Class 4-A history to rush for more than 4,000 career yards, with 4,357 on 711 carries and 72 touchdowns. He played in the 1997 Big 33 Football Classic, the annual game between Pennsylvania and Ohio&#x27;s best high school football players. In basketball, he was recruited to play basketball for Georgetown, UMass, and North Carolina.

Also a standout sprinter, Arrington was on the school&#x27;s track &amp; field team, where he recorded personal-best times of 10.85 seconds in the 100 meters and 23.14 seconds in the 200 meters. He also had top-jumps of 1.96 meters in the high jump and 6.76 meters in the long jump.

While attending Penn State University, Arrington played for coach Joe Paterno&#x27;s Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1997 to 1999. His signature play with the Nittany Lions came during a game against Illinois. On a fourth and short yardage play, Arrington anticipated the snap count and jumped over the offensive line to tackle the runner in the backfield. The play became known as &quot;The LaVar Leap&quot;. Arrington&#x27;s tendency for spectacular plays and his cover appearance on the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 1999 College Football Preview Issue led many to mention him as a possible Heisman Trophy candidate. Arrington received several honors during his college career, including the Chuck Bednarik Award, Dick Butkus Award, and Lambert Award in 1999. He was an All-Big Ten selection, a first-team All-American in 1998, and a consensus first-team All-American in 1999. Arrington finished ninth in balloting for the 1999 Heisman Trophy. He left Penn State after his junior season to enter the NFL draft.

===Washington Redskins===
The Washington Redskins chose Arrington with the second overall pick, in the 2000 NFL draft, and he played for the Redskins from to . After four seasons with the Redskins, Arrington signed an eight-year, $68 million contract extension. His agent Carl Poston was accused of neglecting to inspect the final revision of the contract, in which $6.5 million worth of bonuses contained in earlier drafts were missing. Poston was eventually suspended for two years by the National Football League Players&#x27; Association (NFLPA) over the mishandling of Arrington&#x27;s contract; Arrington did not support the NFLPA&#x27;s decision. Arrington&#x27;s final two seasons with the Redskins was marred by knee injuries and conflicts with coaches Joe Gibbs and Gregg Williams. In March 2006 Arrington paid the Redskins $4.4 million to buy his free agency.

===Motorcycle accident and retirement===
Arrington&#x27;s agent Kevin Poston initially stated that his client intended to play during the 2007 NFL season, saying &quot;things could change at some point, but as of this moment LaVar is focused on playing this season.&quot;

However, on June 18, 2007, Arrington was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in suburban Maryland. He was on the Route 50 off-ramp of the Capital Beltway when he lost control of his 2007 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14, striking a guardrail. Arrington was rushed to Prince George&#x27;s Medical Center, in serious but stable condition. Arrington sustained a broken right forearm, broken lower vertebrae, and deep cuts to his leg. He was issued two citations, one for failure to control speed to avoid a collision, the other for operating a vehicle without a class license that contributed to a crash.

<text>Oren Bloedow (born July 3, 1965) is an American singer, guitarist and bassist. He founded the band Elysian Fields in 1995 with Jennifer Charles. His father, Jerry Bloedow, was a playwright, poet, and film editor whose theater, the Hardware Poet&#x27;s Playhouse, participated in the New York avant-garde scene in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Career==
Bloedow&#x27;s earliest visibility dates from New York&#x27;s legendary venue CBGB, where his high school band, Bones Jones and the Jones Tones, played several times at the beginning of the 1980s. His first true professional musical affiliations were with Phillip Johnston, Bobby Previte, and Wayne Horvitz, all of whom worked with him in Bobby Radcliff&#x27;s blues band shortly afterward. With Radcliff, Bloedow backed up Dr. John, Otis Rush, Johnny Copeland and Paul Butterfield. Another close collaboration was with guitarist Ron Anderson of The Molecules. In 1985 a friend of Anderson&#x27;s introduced Bloedow to 101 Crustaceans, whose leader, Ed Pastorini, is Bloedow&#x27;s oldest continuing musical associate and was a member of Elysian Fields. Bloedow names Pastorini as his favorite musician.

He attended New England Conservatory in 1987–88, studying with Ran Blake and David Holland. Returning to New York City he joined the community forming at the Knitting Factory which included Previte, Horvitz, and Johnston. In 1990 he coupled up with Knitting Factory employee Charles, who became his songwriting and performing partner. In this period Oren toured on bass for The Lounge Lizards, recording the John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards Live in Berlin 1991 concert film and album. Albums with Columbia recording artists Brenda Kahn and Dog&#x27;s Eye View followed. In 1995, his musical project with Charles, now called Elysian Fields, was signed to Radioactive Records. He also recorded an album with close friends Medeski, Martin and Wood for Knitting Factory Records in this period. 

In the 2000s Oren worked extensively with V2/Commotion Records artist Chocolate Genius, contributing to the albums GodMusic and Black Yankee Rock. A Chocolate Genius tour opening for Meshell Ndegeocello brought Oren to that artist&#x27;s attention, and he played in her band frequently in that decade, working on Comfort Woman, The World Has Made Me The Man Of My Dreams, and Devil&#x27;s Halo. 

In 2009 Oren joined members of Antibalas and Director Bill T Jones in creating the Tony award-winning Broadway musical &quot;Fela!&quot;, based on the life and work of Fela Kuti. That production closed at the end of 2010, but the touring version traveled the world for some time afterwards, including a return to the home of Afrobeat, Lagos Nigeria, for which Oren was present.

Another theater project included Bloedow along with Matmos, Gael Rakotondrabe and Doug Wieselman as the pit band under composer/lyricist Anohni, then called Antony Hegarty, on the Robert Wilson spectacle The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic, starring Willem Dafoe and the performance artist Abramovic as herself. A co-production of the Manchester International Festival in the UK, New York&#x27;s Armory and the Teatro Real Madrid, the piece was performed in all of those cities between 2011 and 2013, as well as Amsterdam, Antwerp and Basel.

Since the 2010&#x27;s Oren has composed and recorded several long-form dance pieces, two with Jennifer Charles and one with the poet Christina Clark, for the Paris-based dance group Affairi Esteri. With Shlomi Tuizer of that team, He co-led a workshop at the Abbaye at Royaumount for composers and choreographers in 2015.

In 2015, Oren opened The Owl Music Parlor in Brooklyn, which he books and usually runs singlehanded. Like the Knitting Factory and Tonic, venues that Oren gravitated to as a young musician, The Owl has proved a hub for a thriving musical community and earned a worldwide reputation as a destination for great music.

With Jennifer Charles, he was a headline act the Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków in 2005 and 2015 as La Mar Enfortuna.

<text>Firewater is an American band founded by American singer/instrumentalist Tod A. in New York City in 1995, after the breakup of his previous group Cop Shoot Cop. A self-described &quot;world punk&quot; band, Firewater incorporate diverse elements of world music with punk rock rhythms, including cabaret, ska, jazz, folk and most notably Eastern European influences such as klezmer and gypsy music, which has led to their inclusion in the gypsy punk genre.

, Firewater had released seven studio albums and seen some success, particularly in Europe and on United States college radio stations.

==Biography==
After Tod left his previous group, Cop Shoot Cop, he quickly regrouped and formed Firewater to explore the styles of music Cop Shoot Cop had only hinted at, including klezmer, gypsy, jazz, and ska forms. Labeled a musical collective, Tod has remained Firewater&#x27;s only consistent member, acting as singer-songwriter and bassist/guitarist. Throughout their fluctuating line-up, the band has occasionally featured numerous notable musicians, including Duane Denison of the Jesus Lizard, Yuval Gabay of Soul Coughing, David Ouimet of Motherhead Bug and Foetus, Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields, Hahn Rowe, Tamir Muskat and Ori Kaplan of Gogol Bordello and Balkan Beat Box.

Their album &quot;Songs We Should Have Written&quot; (2004) is a collection of cover songs. It includes songs written by Robyn Hitchcock, The Rolling Stones (&quot;Paint It Black&quot; reinterpreted as a crawlingly slow raga which &quot;shove(s) a few downers down the song&#x27;s throat to counter the original version&#x27;s adrenaline-fueled fire&quot;), and a &quot;dark and sweet&quot; take of Sonny and Cher&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, described as &quot;10 times more ominous and 20 times more pleasurable&quot; than the original. The album also includes a modern rendition of the Johnny Cash anthem &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.

After recording &quot;Songs We Should Have Written&quot;, singer Tod A took a three-year sabbatical, traveling through Thailand, India, Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia and chronicling his experiences on his blog &quot;Postcards from the Other Side of the World.&quot; During this time, he wrote and recorded the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Golden Hour&quot;, with the help of various local musicians and friends, including Firewater producer Tamir Muskat. The record was released May 6, 2008, through Bloodshot Records in the US and Noise-o-lution in Europe. Firewater&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;International Orange!&quot;, was released in September 2012, accompanied by international touring.

<text>Cop Shoot Cop was a noise rock group founded in New York City in 1987. They disbanded in 1996. The band were frequently classified as industrial rock, but were often quite different from many bands so dubbed: having a distinctive instrumental lineup that encompassed twin bass guitars, found metal percussion, and no lead guitar. The group had little mainstream success (scoring a few hits on college radio), despite tours with Iggy Pop and music videos on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot; (notably for &quot;$10 Bill&quot;, featuring a number of little people). They retain a cult following—their out-of-print releases sometimes sell for large amounts.

==History==
Initially, the group was a trio of Tod A. (vocals, bass guitar), David Ouimet (keyboards, sampler) and Phil Puleo on drums and &quot;metal&quot; (he incorporated various found objects into his drum set). (Tod and Puleo had earlier played in a short-lived Providence, Rhode Island group, Dig Dat Hole, with guitarist John Rose). The A./Puleo/Ouimet lineup was captured on the &quot;Headkick Facsimile&quot; 12&quot; EP, which was released in a small pressing by the Japanese record label Supernatural Organization in 1989 (later reissued by the group&#x27;s own Subvert Entertainment in 1994 with the addition of the song &quot;Robert Tilton Handjob&quot; from the &quot;Piece Man&quot; 7&quot;). Wharton Tiers engineered the EP.

Puleo reports their name was inspired by both the band members&#x27; shared dislike of police officers, and a newspaper headline about a botched police raid, reading &quot;&#x27;Cop Shot Cop&quot; or &quot;Cop Shoots Cop&quot;.

The trio placed a number of posters stating only &quot;CopShootCop&quot; around New York, which helped generate discussion and interest; some observers reportedly thought the posters were a political protest against police brutality.

Their first performance was with Half Japanese.

The trio added Jack Natz (formerly bassist in early New York hardcore band The Undead) on bass guitar and Tod briefly sang without playing bass. They missed Tod&#x27;s distinctive &quot;high end&quot; bass playing, however, and they realized only popular convention required a single bass player in a rock band, and both Tod and Natz decided to play the instrument with the group. The relative novelty of a dual-bass, no-guitar rock group certainly helped gather attention. Natz sang occasionally, and various members wrote songs, but Tod remained the group&#x27;s primary singer and songwriter.

Ouimet rejoined and left the group several times; Jim Coleman was recruited to replace him on sampler, and both men were in the group for their debut recording, the &quot;Piece Man&quot; 7&quot; in 1989. The cover was splattered with real pig&#x27;s blood, garnering them notoriety. Their first full-length album, &quot;Consumer Revolt&quot;, recorded by notable producer Martin Bisi, was recorded with two bass guitars and samplers each, and no non-bass guitar. The band quickly earned a reputation as one of the best live bands in NYC, as well as for prolific band graffiti.

After the first album and tour, Ouimet left for good: he founded the short-lived Motherhead Bug and would later guest with Cop Shoot Cop, playing trombone or leading the &quot;Motherhead Horns&quot; horn section.

Cop Shoot Cop continued recording and touring; they surprised some fans by recruiting guitarist Steve McMillen for &quot;Release&quot;, released by Interscope Records. Ned Raggett argues that McMillen&#x27;s appearance &quot;Given how Cop Shoot Cop had evolved its own unique sound out of the basses, drums, and samplers from the original members, becoming more of a straight-ahead rock group inevitably made the band a little less special.&quot; (Still, he offers a largely positive review). A different review notes that &quot;Tod A. is the Andrew Vachss of underground rock, telling stories of pathetic losers and maniac outsiders who believe they are the sane ones&quot;, while Black and Sprague note that &quot;Release&quot; finds Cop Shoot Cop &quot;sneaking surreptitiously toward the mainstream&quot;. In late 1995, Michael Kaminski replaced McMillen on guitar.

The band dissolved later on in 1996. Tod claimed the group had been treated poorly by Interscope, and refused to allow the company to issue their final album. The other band members disagreed, noting the album was very nearly complete, and that they had all worked on the $150,000 recording sessions. The remaining members of Cop Shoot Cop (Natz, Puleo, Coleman, and Kaminski) attempted to complete the album, but Interscope declined to release the material. It eventually found an outlet in the album &quot;Red Expendables&quot;.

===Post-Cop Shoot Cop===
Tod A formed Firewater, who have released seven albums. Coleman has recorded as &quot;Phylr&quot; and &quot;Here&quot; (with Teho Teardo), Puleo played with both Congo Norvell and Swans as well composing for film, and Jack Natz most recently teamed up with Stu Spasm to handle bass duties for a reformed Lubricated Goat. Coleman and Puleo have worked together on a project called Audio Dyslexia. More recently, Coleman and Puleo have collaborated with film and theater actor and writer Michael Wiener on a project called &quot;The Children...&quot;, releasing a self-titled CD and performing a number of show-events typically integrating projections and theatrical elements, and occurring in nontraditional venues such as multimedia dinner theaters and churches.

On their 1997 album &quot;City&quot;, Strapping Young Lad covered &quot;Room 429&quot; (originally from Cop Shoot Cop&#x27;s &quot;Ask Questions Later&quot;.) In the same year, space rock band Spiritualized included a track titled &quot;Cop Shoot Cop&quot; on their album &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot;.

In 2005, Cop Shoot Cop&#x27;s &quot;Migration&quot; (Puleo) was used in a television ad for Nike.

Kaminski continued to play music in Europe, eventually returning to his hometown of Akron, Ohio. In 2008, he made headlines after he conducted a botched robbery with a cologne bottle (shaped as a gun).

In late 2019, Phil Puleo and Jim Coleman joined Chris Spencer (from the now disbanded UNSANE) and Chris Pravdica (former Puleo bandmate from Swans) to form the industrial/rock/noise supergroup Human Impact. Their first self-titled album was released in March 2020.

<doc id="988054" wikidata="Q360527" url="?curid=988054" title="Lenny Krayzelburg">
<text>Lenny Krayzelburg (born Leonid Olehovych Krayzelburg, September 28, 1975) is an American former backstroke swimmer, Olympic gold medalist, and former world record holder. He swam in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, winning a total of four Olympic gold medals.

==Early years==
Krayzelburg is Jewish, and was born to Jewish parents in Odesa, Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). Krayzelburg and his family left the Soviet Union in 1989 for the United States. They settled in Los Angeles.

After their immigration, Krayzelburg&#x27;s family suffered from financial difficulties. He had to commute by bus and on foot 45 minutes each way to swimming practice, and did not get home before 9:30 in the evening. In addition, Lenny had to cope with language problems, and to study English rapidly in order to understand his coaches&#x27; instructions. Thankfully he was aided by the extensive Russian community in Los Angeles, and managed to adapt quickly.

==College==
Lenny first attended Fairfax High School, and then attended Santa Monica College where he won both the 100 and backstroke junior college titles. His coach at Santa Monica recognized his talent and recommended him to Mark Schubert at the University of Southern California. Lenny transferred to USC. In 1995, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Three years later, he became the first swimmer since 1986 to sweep the backstroke events, 100 m &amp; 200 m, in the World Championships.

In 1999, Krayzelburg broke the 50, 100 and the 200 m world records respectively, setting the clock on 24.99, 53.60 and 1:55.87. He was then recognized as the top backstroke swimmer in the world and one of the best in the history of this swimming style.

He continued to dominate at the 2000 Summer Olympics backstroke, shattering the Olympic record and nearing his own 1999 world record with 53.72 in the 100, while making another Olympic record in the 200 with a 1:56.76. He also played an important role in helping the American team win a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay with a new world record of 3:33.73.

==Maccabiah Games==
After the Olympics Krayzelburg decided to skip the 2001 World Championships that took place in Fukuoka, Japan, in order to focus on the 2001 Maccabiah Games in Israel. Being Jewish, Krayzelburg wanted to take this once-in-a-lifetime chance to compete with other top Jewish athletes. In addition, he wanted to fulfill a childhood dream by visiting the holy land, and lifting the American delegate flag during the games&#x27; opening ceremony. He was selected to carry in the flag for the United States at the opening ceremonies. He then earned gold and set a new Maccabiah record in the 100-meter backstroke. He also won a gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay.

At the 2017 Maccabiah Games, in the special 4×50m relay race between Israeli and American all-star teams, American Olympic champions Krayzelburg, Jason Lezak (four Olympic golds), and Anthony Ervin (three Olympic golds), with masters swimmer Alex Blavatnik, swam a time of 1:48.23 and defeated Israeli Olympians Guy Barnea, Yoav Bruck, Eran Groumi, and Tal Stricker, who had a time of 1:51.25.

==Difficulties, perseverance==

A couple of months later he had to undergo surgery on his left shoulder, following a fall while running on a treadmill, after which he had to take a year off swimming.

In September 2003, Krazelburg split from his coach Mark Schubert, to start training under Dave Salo, who also coached Aaron Peirsol. Peirsol was considered by many to be Krayzelburg&#x27;s successor. Working with Salo, Krayzelburg changed the style of his stroke, particularly due to his shoulder injuries.

<doc id="988055" wikidata="Q4970791" url="?curid=988055" title="British Rail Class 404">
<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations [[British Rail Class 404|4-COR]], [[British Rail Class 404|4-RES]], [[British Rail Class 404|4-BUF]] and [[British Rail Class 404|4-GRI]] to the different types of electric multiple unit built to work the route between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. The 4-COR type units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 404. The COR designation had previously been used for the 6-PUL units and was reused by them during World War II when the Pullman car was stored, but this stock was different from the 4-COR units.

==Phase 1 units==
The SR electrified the London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour via Woking line in the mid-1930s, and full electric services commenced over the route from April 1937. For this service, 29 4-COR units (4-car Corridor units, numbered 3101–3129) and 19 4-RES units (4-car Restaurant units, numbered 3054–3072) were built.

Corridor connections were provided throughout each unit, including between units. This gave them a distinctive front-end appearance as the headcode display was placed on the opposite side of the gangway connection to the driving cab window, leading to their nickname of Nelsons (referring to Lord Nelson&#x27;s eyepatch, and also to their connection with Portsmouth).

It was intended that, for principal services, 12-car formations would operate with a 4-RES unit (providing the kitchen and dining facilities for the train) sandwiched by two 4-COR units. While all the other carriages for these units were built by the SR at its Eastleigh Works, the Trailer First carriages (which were laid out as dining cars) were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRCW) and the Trailer Restaurant Kitchen Third carriages by Metropolitan Cammell.

==Phase 2 units==
The SR then electrified the line from Three Bridges to Portsmouth via Horsham and the coastal route from West Worthing to Havant, with services over this route commencing in July 1938. For services from London Victoria to Portsmouth via Dorking over these lines, another 26 4-COR units (numbered 3130–3155) were built, together with 13 4-BUF units (4-car Buffet units, numbered 3073–3085).

These new units followed the same design as the Phase 1 stock, except that the restaurant and kitchen facilities of the 4-RES units were replaced by the simpler provision of a buffet. All of these units were built by the SR at its Eastleigh works.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows:

==Reformations and conversions==
Due to the late delivery of the kitchen and dining carriages for the 4-RES units, these cars were not formed in the sets in numerical order, and some of the driving motor cars initially ran with other trailer cars as 4-COR formations.

The first changes took place during World War II, following the destruction of 25 carriages during bombing raids. This total included the equivalent of three 4-RES units. A number of units were reformed to re-use the carriages that survived from individual units, and after the war was over new carriages were built to replace those destroyed, taking the numbers of the old ones. In total this involved eleven driving motor cars, seven Trailer Thirds, five Trailer Composites, and one buffet car and dining car apiece. This re-arrangement led to the loss of 4-RES units 3058, 3060 and 3063 and the formation of three new 4-COR units, which took numbers 3156–3158.

In 1955 4-RES unit 3072 was converted to a 4-BUF unit following a fire in the kitchen car, which was rebuilt as a prototype Restaurant Buffet design for British Rail. In 1961–1962 the kitchen cars in 4-RES units 3056, 3065 and 3068 were converted into Griddle cars. The units involved were given the classification 4-GRI, and in 1964 they were renumbered 3086–3088.

In January 1964 the remaining 4-RES units were disbanded and the carriages reformed with former 6-PUL and 6-PAN stock. Between then and the final withdrawal of these carriages at the end of the 1960s a variety of different unit formations were created, including further 4-COR units (numbers 3159–3166), 6-COR (3041–3050), 4-PUL (3054–3059), 4-COR(N) (3065–3071) and 6-TC (601). For further details of this complex period of unit reformations, see here.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 3 June 1960, an empty stock train formed by two units of the class overran signals at Waterloo and was in a sidelong collision with a steam-hauled passenger train that was departing for , Dorset. A few passengers suffered slight injuries.

==Withdrawal and further use==
Apart from the 4-RES units, which were disbanded in 1964, the 4-COR, 4-BUF and 4-GRI types continued in existence through to the withdrawal of this stock from passenger service in 1972, covering various other services, such as the South Coast Services and the Waterloo - Reading Line, although the last planned working by 4-COR units on Waterloo to Portsmouth diagrams was on 31 July 1971. Thereafter the underframes of a number of carriages were reused by the engineering department as long welded rail carriers and crane runners. A full list of vehicles affected is below:

==Preservation==

One complete unit was saved for preservation, as were a number of individual vehicles. The complete 4-COR(N) 3142 was purchased by the Southern Electric Group for preservation by British Rail in 1972 and moved to the since defunct Steam Centre at Ashford (Kent).

In 1976 it was moved north to the Nene Valley Railway and helped form the opening train in 1977. The unit came south again to Brighton in September 1986 for restoration work. The unit was moved again to St Leonards Engineering Depot in 1991 as better facilities aided restoration. By 2003 the unit had to be moved to the Bluebell Railway, with S11187S going to the London Transport Museum at Acton.

Later on three of the unit&#x27;s coaches were moved to the East Kent Railway, with one coach remaining at Horsted Keynes station as an exhibit coach. In late 2012 S11187S was moved to join the three more coaches at the East Kent Railway. The unit has been operational as a two coach hauled unit since July 2013; the Southern Electric Group continues further restoration work on the unit to date.
In June, 2017, DMBTO 11201, TCK 11825 and TSK 10096 were moved to a site in Kent and sheeted.

Details are set out of surviving vehicles below:

<doc id="988059" wikidata="Q5569055" url="?curid=988059" title="Glenn Presnell">
<text>Glenn Emery &quot;Press&quot; Presnell (July 28, 1905 – September 13, 2004) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He set the NFL single-season scoring record in 1933 and led the league in total offense. He was the last surviving member of the Detroit Lions inaugural 1934 team and helped lead the team to its first NFL championship in 1935. He also set an NFL record with a 54-yard field goal in 1934, a record which was not broken for 19 years. Presnell served as the head football coach at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1942 and at Eastern Kentucky State College—now known as Eastern Kentucky University–from 1954 to 1963, compiling a career college football coaching record of 45–56–3. He was also the athletic director at Eastern Kentucky from 1963 to 1971.

==Early life==
Born in Gilead, Nebraska, Presnell attended DeWitt High School and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. He played college football as a halfback for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team from 1925 to 1927. In 1925, Presnell led Nebraska to a 14–0 victory over an Illini team that included the &quot;Galloping Ghost&quot;, Red Grange. As one writer put it, &quot;all the galloping was done by Presnell this day.&quot; Presnell was selected as a first-team player on the 1927 College Football All-America Team.

==Professional football==
After leaving Nebraska, Presnell played football for the Ironton Tanks in Ironton, Ohio. He was a player-coach for the team and also taught science at Ironton High School. Presnell was a halfback in Ironton&#x27;s single wing offense and also played on defense at what would later be considered the safety position. Although not officially part of the National Football League, the Tanks played against teams in the league. In 1930, Presnell led Ironton to victories over both the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. Against the Giants, the Tanks trailed 12–6 with three seconds left. Presnell threw a touchdown pass to Gene Alford and then kicked the extra point to give Ironton a 13–12 victory over a Giants team that finished in second place in the NFL. He also scored two touchdowns against the Bears, including an 88-yard run.

After the 1930 season, the Tanks folded. In 1931, Presnell joined the Portsmouth Spartans in the NFL. He had his best season in 1933, when he led the NFL in total offense with 1,296 yards. He also broke the single-season NFL scoring record with 64 points. Ken Strong tied with Presnell with the same point total in 1933. During the 1933 NFL season, Presnell completed 50 of 125 passes for 774 passing yards and added 522 rushing yards on 118 carries for an average of 4.4 yards per carry. He also kicked five field goals and 13 extra points. He led the NFL with six rushing touchdowns and 13 successful extra point conversions. He also finished second in the league (behind Harry Newman) in passing touchdowns, passes completed, pass attempts, and passing yards. Following the 1933 season, Presnell was selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the NFL, the United Press, and Collyers Eye Magazine.

In 1934, the owner of the Portsmouth Spartans sold the team. The team was moved from Portsmouth, Ohio to Detroit, Michigan, and became the Detroit Lions. When Presnell visited Detroit to sign his first contract with the Lions in 1934, team owner George A. Richards allowed Presnell to pick the team&#x27;s colors. Presnell later recalled: &quot;Mr. Richards, the owner, the day I was up there and signed my contract, he said: &#x27;There&#x27;s a table out there in the next office covered with uniforms. Why don&#x27;t you pick out the colors you like?&#x27; I went out. My wife was with me. We saw this Honolulu blue and silver and we fell in love with it.&quot;

Presnell remained with the Lions from 1934 to 1936. He combined with Dutch Clark, Ace Gutowsky, and Ernie Caddel to lead the Lions to a second-place finish in 1934. And in 1935, the same group led the Lions to their first NFL championship, culminating with a 26–7 victory over the New York Giants in the 1935 NFL Championship Game. Presnell also set an NFL record with a 54-yard field goal in 1934, a mark that was not broken until 1953.

==Coaching and later years==
Presnell began his coaching career while still paying for the Lions in 1936, when he was hired as head football coach at Lawrence Institute of Technology—now known as Lawrence Technological University—in Highland Park, Michigan. He retired as a player after the 1936 season at age 31. Presnell worked as an assistant football coach at the University of Kansas in 1937 and then as the backfield coach at Nebraska from 1938 to 1941. In February 1942, he became the head football coach and athletic director at Nebraska. The Cornhuskers compiled a record of 3–7 in Presnell&#x27;s one season as head coach.

In December 1942, Presnell enlisted in the United States Navy. In May 1943, he was commissioned as a lieutenant and assigned to the Navy&#x27;s physical education training program. In 1944 Presnell served as backs coach at the North Carolina Pre-Flight School. He spent three years in the Navy.

In 1954, Presnell returned to coaching as the head football coach for Eastern Kentucky University. He held that position from 1954 to 1963. He was then athletic director at Eastern Kentucky until his retirement in 1971.

Presnell died in September 2004 in Ironton, Ohio at the age of 99. He had been the last surviving member of the Detroit Lions&#x27; inaugural 1934 team.

<doc id="988060" wikidata="Q10974017" url="?curid=988060" title="Huarijio language">
<text>Huarijio (&quot;Huarijío&quot; in Spanish; also spelled Guarijío, Varihío, and Warihío) is a Uto-Aztecan language of the states of Chihuahua and Sonora in northwestern Mexico. It is spoken by around 2,100 Huarijio people, most of whom are monolinguals.

==Distribution==
The language has two variants, known as Mountain Guarijio &quot;(guarijío de la sierra)&quot; and River Guarijio &quot;(guarijío del río)&quot;. The mountain variant is spoken in the Chihuahuan municipalities of Chínipas (settlements of Agua Caliente, Arroyo de la Yerba, Benjamín M. Chaparro (Santa Ana), Chínipas de Almada, El Manzanillal, El Trigo de Russo (El Trigo), El Triguito, Guazizaco, Ignacio Valenzuela (Loreto), Los Alamillos de Loreto, Los Llanitos, and Los Pinos), Moris (settlements of Bermudez, Casa Quemada, El Campo Mayo, El Gavilán, El Pilar, El Saucito (De Beltrán), La Cieneguita de Rodríguez, La Finca de Pesqueira, Los Terreros, Mesa Colorada, Moris, Río Santa María, Santa María Grande, Sierra Obscura (El Serruchito), and Trompa), and Uruachi (settlements of Arechuyvo (Arechuivo), Aremeyvo, Arroyo Seco, Batopilillas, Boca Arroyo del Carrizo (Hornitos), Cachabachi, Cerro Blanco, Cuiteco, Chacharachi, Chagayvo, Chiltepín, El Barro, El Bosque, El Carrizo, El Cuzal, El Metate, El Pinito, El Revaje, Gosogachi, Guasaremos, Jecopaco, Jicamorachi, La Barranca, La Cueva de Diego, La Cumbre, La Mesa de Cereachi, La Nopalera, La Reforma, Las Pilas, Los Hornitos, Los Lajeros, Los Laureles, Mesa Quemada, Mocorichi de Arriba, Noriego, Pacayvo, Palmarito (Agua Caliente), San Juan, San Luis, Saucillo de Rico, Sipachi, Tesos, Tojiachi de Abajo, Toribisachi, Uruachi, and Venustiano Carranza (San Luis de Babarocos)).

The river variant is found in the Sonoran municipalities of Álamos (settlements of Bavícora, Burapaco, Casas Coloradas, Chorijoa, El Chalate, El Sauz, Guajaray, Huataturi, Jobeg I, La Sauceda, La Tribuna, Los Estrados, Mesa Colorada, Mochibampo, Ranch Nuevo, San Bernardo, Sejaqui, and Tecoripa) and Quiriego (settlements of Batacosa, El Frijolar, Los Bajíos (Ejido los Conejos), and Quiriego).

Speakers of Mountain Guarijio self-identify as &quot;Warihó&quot; and call River Guarijio speakers &quot;macurawe&quot; or &quot;makulái&quot;. River Guarijio speakers call themselves &quot;Warihío&quot; and call Mountain speakers &quot;tarahumaras&quot;. Contact between the two groups is scant and, although the linguistic differences between the two are slight, speakers report that mutual comprehension is difficult.

==Morphology==
Guarijio is an agglutinative language, where words are morphologically complex to accomplish various grammatical purposes, i.e. several morphemes are strung together. The Guarijio language typologically has the tendency to show a final verb order. However, the word order in Guarijio is rather free (Miller, 1996).

==Phonology==
The consonant inventory includes:

The vowel inventory includes: , , , , .

==Media==
Programming in Guarijio is carried by the CDI&#x27;s radio station XEETCH, broadcasting from Etchojoa, Sonora.

<text>Eofor (Proto-Norse *&quot;Eburaz&quot;), son of Wonred, was a Geatish warrior in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. When the Swedes invaded Geatland (Götaland), the Geatish king Hæþcyn was killed by the Swedish king Ongenþeow. Hygelac, who became the new king, sent Eofor and his brother Wulf to fight against the hoary-bearded Swedish king. During the fight Wulf was severely wounded, but Eofor slew Ongenþeow and carried Ongenþeow&#x27;s arms to Hygelac. Eofor and Wulf were not only richly recompensed, but Eofor was given the greatest possible gift for his service, the daughter of Hygelac.

J. R. R. Tolkien, who studied &quot;Beowulf&quot; intensively, used the name Éofor as the name of a prince of a warrior people in the background history for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

&quot;Eofor&quot; is Old English for &quot;boar&quot;.

It is widely agreed that Ongenþeow is identical to King Egil (also Angantyr) in the Ynglingasaga. In this saga, Egil is killed by a bull, which likely originates from a mistranslation of the Ynglingatal, where he was killed by a boar. As such, it&#x27;s possible that this means that the name Eofor was misinterpreted in later stories as a literal boar that killed the king of the Swedes.

<text>The Cucujidae, or flat bark beetles, are a family of distinctively flat beetles found worldwide (except Africa and Antarctica) under the bark of dead trees. The family has received considerable taxonomic attention in recent years and now consists of 70 species distributed in five genera. It was indicated Cucujus species are scavengers, only feeding on pupae and larvae of other insects and on other subcortical beetles such as their own. Since the Cucujidae prey on larvae of potentially tree damaging beetles that spread fungal diseases, they are considered to be beneficial to the health of living trees.

Included genera are: &quot;Cucujus&quot; Fabricius, with 14 species and subspecies distributed throughout the Holarctic; &quot;Palaestes&quot; Perty, 8 spp., Neotropical; &quot;Pediacus&quot; Shuckard, 31 spp., mostly Holarctic, but extending south into the Neotropics and to Australia; &quot;Platisus&quot; Erichson, 5 spp. in Australia and New Zealand, and &quot;Thesaurus&quot; known from South America.
Cucujidae have elongate parallel-side bodies ranging from 6 to 25 mm in length. Most are brown colored, while others are black, reddish or yellow. Heads are triangular in shape, with filiform to moniliform antennae of 11 antennomeres, and large mandibles. The pronotum is narrower than the head.
Both larvae and adults live under bark, otherwise little is known of their habits. Larvae and adults appear to be predacious. &quot;Cucujus cinnaberinus&quot; seems to be able to colonize isolated habitats from persisting local populations if there is a sufficient quantity of suitable deadwood in the habitat and it has the other requirements of saproxylic beetles.

The family was formerly larger, with subfamilies Laemophloeinae, Silvaninae, and Passandrinae (and some tenebrionoid genera mixed in), but revisions have raised the subfamilies to family status.

While there have been claimed fossil records going back to the Early Cretaceous (such as those from the Crato Formation of Brazil), the oldest unambiguous records are from the Eocene.

== Species with extreme freezing tolerance ==
&quot;Cucujus clavipes puniceus&quot; (red flat bark beetle) found in arctic regions like Canada and Alaska desiccates to 30–40% body water in winter vs 4% body water in the chironomid fly, &quot;Polypedilum vanderplanki&quot;. It uses a variety of anti-freeze proteins in contrast with the non-protein xylomannan exploited by another arctic beetle &quot;Upis ceramboides&quot;.

<text>The Irish Literary Theatre was founded by W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Moore and Edward Martyn in Dublin, Ireland, in 1899. It proposed to give performances in Dublin of Irish plays by Irish authors.

==History==
W.B. Yeats, lady Gregory, Edward Martyn, published a &quot;manifesto for Irish Literary Theatre&quot; in 1897, in which they proclaimed their intention of establishing a national theatre for Ireland.

In 1899 Lady Gregory secured a temporary licence for a play to be given at the Antient Concert Rooms in Great Brunswick St in Dublin, and so enabled the Irish Literary Theatre to give its first production. 

The play chosen was &quot;The Countess Cathleen&quot; by W. B. Yeats. It was done by a very efficient London company that included May Whitty (Dame May Webster) and Ben Webster. The next production given was Edwards Martyn&#x27;s play The Heather Field. 

In the following year the Irish Literary Theatre produced at the Gaiety Theatre three plays: &quot;Maeve&quot; by Edward Martyn, &quot;The Last Feast of Fianna&quot; by Alice Milligan, and &quot;The Bending of the Bough&quot; by George Moore. The &quot;Bending of the Bough&quot; was staged during the Boer War which begun on 11 October 1899.

The Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901, when it collapsed due to lack of funding.

The use of non-Irish actors in these productions was perceived to be a failure, and a new group of Irish players was put together by the Fay brothers,among others. These went on to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which led to the Abbey Theatre.

<text>The Restricted Duty Ribbon is a decoration of the United States Coast Guard which was created on March 3, 1984. The award recognizes those Coast Guard personnel who have completed a permanent tour of duty at specific shore units where accompanying dependents are not authorized.

Where a service member is assigned without his or her dependent family members, the duty status is known as &quot;unaccompanied.&quot; Standard unaccompanied duty tours are normally one to two years in length and occur in remote duty locations such as Greenland and the Arctic, and in combat areas. The Restricted Duty Ribbon is awarded at the conclusion of the unaccompanied tour. 

In the case of overseas restricted duty stations, personnel who are eligible to receive the Restricted Duty Ribbon are not eligible to receive the Coast Guard Overseas Service Ribbon for the same period.

The Coast Guard is the only branch of the United States armed forces to award a decoration for the completion of unaccompanied duty tours, although the assignments for which the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Service Ribbon is awarded are usually unaccompanied. Additional awards of the Restricted Duty Ribbon are denoted by bronze and silver service stars.

<text>Charles Ronald Palumbo (born June 15, 1971) is an American retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with professional wrestling promotions World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWE) in the late-1990s and 2000s, where he held the WCW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E World Tag Team Championship. He hosted the Discovery Channel series &quot;Lords of the Car Hoards&quot; and &quot;Rusted Development&quot;.

==Early life==
Chuck Palumbo grew up in West Warwick, Rhode Island. He attended West Warwick High School, where he earned all-state honors in basketball. He joined the US Navy soon after and spent time in the Persian Gulf, working the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson. He was initially assigned to an F-18 Hornet squadron VAQ-34 at Lemoore, California before transferring to NAS Miramar in San Diego where he worked on the E-2C Hawkeye. Chuck finished up his stint in the Navy and enrolled at the Community College of Rhode Island earning All-American honors in basketball and a full scholarship to University of Central Missouri. While attending Central Missouri, watching a WCW TV show, he saw a commercial for the WCW PowerPlant. He called the number, and after graduating with a Criminal Justice degree, decided to accept their invitation to travel to Atlanta and train at the WCW Power Plant.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Championship Wrestling (1998–2001)===

====Training and undercard (1998–1999)====

Palumbo began his career in 1998 on the independent circuit, using a surfer gimmick and the ring name &quot;The Dude&quot;. He made his debut appearance on World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s &quot;Nitro&quot; on October 19, 1998, as a fan who accepted the challenge of Ernest &quot;The Cat&quot; Miller. Six months later, he was offered a training contract by WCW in April 1999. Just prior to the hiring of Vince Russo and Ed Ferrera as bookers for WCW, many of the WCW Power Plant wrestlers debuted on &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;WorldWide&quot;.

====World Tag Team Champion (2000–2001)====

On January 19, 2000, at &quot;WCW Saturday Night Taping (January &#x27;00 #3)&quot;, Chuck Palumbo defeated Mike Sanders.
On February 16, at &quot;WCW Saturday Night Taping (February &#x27;00 #4)&quot;, Palumbo teamed with Sonny Siaki to defeat Allan Funk and Rick Cornell.
On March 1, at &quot;WCW Saturday Night Taping (March &#x27;00 #1)&quot;, Palumbo and Siaki challenged Big Vito and Johnny The Bull for the WCW World Tag Team Titles but was unsuccessful at winning the titles.
On March 5, at &quot;WCW Live&quot;, Palumbo defeated Bobby Eaton.
On March 14, at &quot;WCW WorldWide Taping&quot;&#x27; Chuck Palumbo was defeated by Lenny Lane.
In 2000, Palumbo made his debut on WCW television on the March 21, 2000, edition of &quot;Thunder&quot; under his real name, losing to Scott Steiner. After this match, Palumbo was chosen by Bischoff and Russo to be The New Blood&#x27;s version of Lex Luger in May 2000. He was given the nickname &quot;The Main Event&quot;.

Palumbo feuded with Luger until late May 2000 when Palumbo formed a team called &quot;The Perfect Event&quot; with Shawn Stasiak and the pair won the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Their main feud was against KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark). In August, Stasiak and Palumbo helped form the Natural Born Thrillers with Mike Sanders, Sean O&#x27;Haire, Mark Jindrak, and Reno while they were briefly &quot;coached&quot; by Kevin Nash.

Palumbo and Stasiak won the WCW World Tag Team Championship two more times before splitting in early January 2001 when he and Stasiak won a tag team battle royal with O&#x27;Haire and Jindrak for a future tag team title shot. After the conclusion of the match Mike Sanders declared both teams victorious and that any combination of the four would face The Insiders (Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash). Palumbo and O&#x27;Haire were the two members of the Natural Born Thrillers who would face and defeat Page and Nash for the tag titles at Sin on January 14, 2001. Following the title victory, the Natural Born Thrillers broke up when the team of Jindrak and Stasiak became jealous of Palumbo and O&#x27;Haire. The teams faced each other at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, 2001, for the tag team title, which Palumbo and O&#x27;Haire retained. The duo also retained the title against Totally Buffed (Buff Bagwell and Lex Luger) at Greed in March, WCW&#x27;s last pay-per-view. On March 23, the World Wrestling Federation acquired the assets of WCW and Palumbo&#x27;s contract was acquired. The following Monday on the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Palumbo and O&#x27;Haire defeated Team Canada&#x27;s Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in the final WCW World Tag Team Championship title defense on the program.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2000) ===
On April 14, 2000, Chuck Palumbo made his NJPW debut, at &quot;NJPW Strong Energy &#x27;00 Day 1&quot;, where he defeated Black Cat.
On April 15, at &quot;NJPW Strong Energy &#x27;00 Day 2&quot;, Palumbo teamed with Rick Cornell and Osamu Kido but was defeated by Brian Johnston, Junji Hirata and Tadao Yasuda in a 6 man tag match.
On April 16, at &quot;NJPW Strong Energy &#x27;00 Day 3&quot;, Palumbo teamed with Rick Cornell, Dan Devine and Takashi Lazuka but was defeated by Hiro Saito, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Super J and Tatsutoshi Goto in a 8 person tag match.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2004)===

====The Alliance (2001)====

Palumbo and O&#x27;Haire made their WWF debuts on the June 28, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of The Alliance, attacking the Hardy Boyz. O&#x27;Haire and Palumbo started feuding with the Acolytes Protection Agency (A.P.A.) in the following weeks, which ended at WWF Invasion on July 22, 2001, when the Acolytes Protection Agency defeated them. Subsequently, O&#x27;Haire and Palumbo defeated the Hardy Boyz on the August 2, 2001, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. O&#x27;Haire and Palumbo lost the WCW Tag Team Championship to the Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) on the August 9, 2001, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and lost their rematch for the tag-team gold in a steel cage match the following week on &quot;Raw&quot;. O&#x27;Haire and Palumbo&#x27;s last televised match together was on the August 26 edition of &quot;Heat&quot; defeating the Holly Cousins (Hardcore and Crash).

O&#x27;Haire was sent to developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling in early September 2001, and Palumbo was thrown out of The Alliance on the October 25 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by storyline co-owner of The Alliance, Stephanie McMahon. He joined the WWF in November.

====Billy and Chuck (2001–2002)====
When he returned, Palumbo found a tag team partner in Billy Gunn. The pair started as a tag team working dark matches, but were later given a gimmick that saw the pair grow increasingly affectionate towards each other, showing evidence of a homosexual relationship. Palumbo became known simply as Chuck, and he bleached his hair blond to match Gunn&#x27;s.

On the February 21, 2002, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Billy and Chuck defeated Tazz and Spike Dudley to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Palumbo made his WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania X8, when Billy and Chuck defend their titles in a Four corners elimination match against the APA, The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz. They lost the tag team gold to Rikishi and their stylist Rico Constantino, who was forced to team with Rikishi on May 19, 2002, at Judgment Day. Less than a month later Rico helped Billy and Chuck recapture the title, but they later lost it to Edge and Hollywood Hulk Hogan.

In the second half of 2002, Billy and Chuck were the source of controversy when Chuck apparently proposed to Billy on September 5, 2002, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; asking him to be his &quot;partner for life&quot;. They had a marriage ceremony on the 2002 season premiere of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Just before they tied the knot, however, they revealed that the entire ordeal was a publicity stunt, and both characters disavowed their on-screen homosexuality. When Billy and Chuck decided not to go through with the marriage, Rico turned on them by helping Eric Bischoff and 3-Minute Warning attack the duo. Rico subsequently jumped to &quot;Raw&quot; as the manager of 3-Minute Warning, who beat Billy and Chuck at Unforgiven. Billy was injured in early October 2002, and Chuck worked on &quot;Velocity&quot; for a few months using his original ring name Chuck Palumbo once again.

====The Full Blooded Italians (2003–2004)====
In February 2003, Palumbo formed the Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I.) in WWE, a faction which had previously been seen in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). After a beating at the hands of Rikishi, Nunzio threatened to bring in his &quot;family&quot; in order to gain revenge. The next week, Palumbo and Johnny &quot;The Bull&quot; Stamboli joined Nunzio to form the F.B.I. and attacked Rikishi. This version initially gained little success, but would go on to have brief feuds with Los Guerreros, Chris Benoit, Rhyno, Brian Kendrick, Nathan Jones, the APA, and The Undertaker.

Palumbo was traded to the Raw brand on March 22, 2004, along with A-Train in exchange for Rico and Jackie Gayda. After Palumbo was traded to the Raw brand, he was kept off television until July 2004, when he debuted with a new look and entrance music. His new image resembled a cross between an auto mechanic and a greaser. He would later give himself the nickname &quot;Custom Chucky P.&quot; It was not long before Palumbo was a regular on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. His new gimmick started off usually losing matches but began to rise on &quot;Heat&quot;, defeating the likes of The Hurricane, Rosey, Val Venis and Stevie Richards. On the October 31, 2004, airing of &quot;Heat&quot;, Palumbo had his most high-profile match on the Raw brand when he faced former World Heavyweight Champion Chris Benoit, but was defeated. Palumbo was released by WWE soon after on November 4, 2004.

===Independent circuit (2005–2006)===
Palumbo, along with Johnny Stamboli, went on to become a member of Voodoo Murders of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and feuded against Roughly Obsess and Destroy. Palumbo teamed with former FBI partner Stamboli to challenge for the World Tag Team Championship on March 20, 2005, but were defeated by Jamal and Taiyo Kea of RO&amp;D.

Stamboli and Palumbo&#x27;s next stop would be with the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where the pair reformed the FBI. The duo also made appearances in a World Wrestling Council show where they challenged Último Dragón, Místico, and Negro Casas, in a tag team match which they would win by securing both the first and third falls. In early 2006, he made appearances in Mexico for Toryumon Mexico.

===Return to WWE (2006–2008)===

In March 2006, Palumbo re-signed with the WWE and began working house shows and dark matches over the next year. Palumbo officially returned on the May 25, 2007, edition of &quot;Heat&quot; with a biker gimmick, and defeated Charlie Haas. He then continued making appearances on &quot;Heat&quot;, where he consistently defeated jobbers. In an interview with WWE.com, Palumbo claimed that the biker character was not a gimmick and that he works on bikes two or three times a week. On July 6, 2007, Palumbo made his &quot;SmackDown!&quot; re-debut, defeating Kenny Dykstra in his return match.

Palumbo began an on-screen relationship with Michelle McCool, whom he teamed with to defeat Dykstra and Victoria in a mixed tag team match. He then feuded with Jamie Noble, after Noble made advances towards McCool. After a series of matches between the men, Noble won a date with McCool by defeating Palumbo. Palumbo accidentally elbowed McCool during a match, causing her to suffer a storyline concussion. The partnership was dissolved when McCool refused to accept his apology the following week. Palumbo vowed to get revenge on Noble, and defeated Noble the following week.

Palumbo participated in the Royal Rumble match, where he eliminated Jamie Noble. He next appeared at WrestleMania XXIV, taking part in a 24-man Interpromotional Battle Royal to crown a number one contender to the ECW Championship, where he also eliminated Noble. During a series of house shows in June 2008, Palumbo challenged Matt Hardy for the United States Championship, though he was unsuccessful in winning the championship. As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Palumbo was drafted to the Raw brand. He never made his return to the brand however, as he was released from his WWE contract on November 7, 2008.

===Independent circuit (2008–2012)===

Palumbo returned to Mexico to team with Damián 666 and Konnan in a losing effort against D-Generation MEX at &quot;Wrestling in Tijuana&quot; on December 25, 2008. He also teamed with Konnan in World Wrestling Association. Palumbo wrestled for Ultimo Dragon&#x27;s Toryumon promotion and competed in the IWL World Title Tournament in Mexico as well.

He returned to Nu-Wrestling (now named New Wrestling Entertainment, and located in France) in September 2009, and feuded with Mr. Anderson. Palumbo, Anderson and Tiny Iron competed in a triple threat for the vacant NWE Heavyweight Championship, which Anderson won. Palumbo challenged Anderson to a match for the championship on October 3, 2009, but was defeated.

On November 13, 2009, Palumbo won the Herts and Essex Wrestling (HEW) Heavyweight Championship from Brett Meadows in Braintree, England. He is the first American to hold the British promotion&#x27;s championship. However, he lost the championship back to Meadows two days later in Colchester, England following interference from Sam Knee and Britani Knight.

In an interview with &quot;Hit The Ropes Radio&quot;, Palumbo confirmed he was in talks with TNA to sign with the company, though he opted not to sign. Palumbo wrestled his final match at Future Stars Wrestling&#x27;s New Years Resolution event in 2012, where he defeated Jayson Cash. After this, he quietly retired, and confirmed to Bill Apter in a 2014 interview that his wrestling career was over.

==Other endeavors==

Palumbo runs a business called CP Kustoms, where he builds his own motorcycles, as well as repairing and customizing cars and motorcycles. A Palumbo-made motorcycle was featured in the April issue of &quot;American Iron Magazine&quot;. In 2009, Palumbo built a motorcycle to raise money for veterans returning home. He rode the bike across the country to gather donations and raffles, with 100% of the proceeds going to &quot;Fueled by the Fallen&quot;, a nonprofit that supports troops after they return home.

In 2006 Palumbo learned how to play guitar, and now plays in his own band, 3 Spoke Wheel. Using the same theme as CP Kustoms, he opened up Chuck Palumbo&#x27;s Garage Gym, where he teaches cross-fit classes.

In 2014, he began co-hosting the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Lords of the Car Hoards&quot; with custom car builder Rick Dore. The show focuses on SLAM garage, the garage Dore and Palumbo co-own, to fix and customize cars and motorcycles. For the second season the show was renamed &quot;Rusted Development&quot;.

==Personal life==
Palumbo&#x27;s brother, Chris, was awarded several medals for his military service in Afghanistan including the Distinguished Service Cross. Palumbo is good friends with fellow professional wrestlers Batista, Mark Jindrak, Booker T, Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Rey Mysterio. He was also close to former tag partner Sean O&#x27;Haire, who died September 8, 2014.

Palumbo currently resides in San Diego, California. He has a daughter named Charli, who is an aspiring DJ. In January 2016, Palumbo reportedly saved a woman from a car accident by lifting the car, then lifting the woman out of the car.

<text>Adolf Bernhard Philipp Reinach (; ; 23 December 1883 – 16 November 1917) was a German philosopher, phenomenologist from the Munich phenomenology school and law theorist.

==Life and work==
Adolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz, Germany, on 23 December 1883.

Adolf Reinach studied at the &quot;Ostergymnasium&quot; in Mainz (where he became at first interested in Plato) and later entered the University of Munich in 1901 where he studied mainly psychology and philosophy under Theodor Lipps. In the circle of Lipps&#x27; students he came in contact with Moritz Geiger, Otto Selz, Aloys Fischer and above all Johannes Daubert. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of Edmund Husserl, especially his &quot;Logische Untersuchungen&quot; (&quot;Logical Investigations&quot;).

In 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work &quot;Über den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht&quot; (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended Alexander Pfänder), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl at the University of Göttingen. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for Göttingen, inspired by Husserl&#x27;s works (which is referred to as the Munich invasion of Göttingen).

Later in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906–07 at the University of Tübingen. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist Ernst Beling, by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to Göttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl.

With the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at Göttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by Anton Marty and Johannes Daubert, besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexandre Koyré and Edith Stein) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on Plato and Immanuel Kant.

In this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, and asked Reinach’s assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pfänder founded the famous &quot;Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung&quot;, with Husserl as main editor.

Besides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of speech acts by Austin and Searle: &quot;Die apriorischen Grundlagen des bürgerlichen Rechtes&quot; (The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law) is a systematic treatment of social acts as performative utterances and &quot;a priori&quot; foundations of civil law. Reinach&#x27;s work was based mostly on Husserl&#x27;s analysis of meaning in the &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, but also on Daubert&#x27;s criticism of it. Alexander Pfänder (1870–1941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period.

After Husserl&#x27;s publication of the &quot;Ideen&quot; (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of Munich phenomenology came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl&#x27;s earlier work, the &quot;Logical investigations&quot;. Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current.

Reinach was converted to Lutheranism along with his wife.

At the outbreak of World War I Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the Iron Cross, Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917.

After his death, Edith Stein was given the task of arranging his manuscript writings. Reinach had said shortly before his death that he would only teach philosophy in the future as a means of leading men to God, and this may have been reflected in these writings. But Edith Stein was impressed by the resignation and faith of his widow. She wrote, &quot;This was my first encounter with the Cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it ... it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and Christ began to shine his light on me – Christ in the mystery of the Cross.&quot; Several years later she became a Christian and a Carmelite nun.

<text>Carlos María de Alvear (October 25, 1789 in Santo Ángel, Rio Grande do Sul – November 3, 1852 in New York), was an Argentine soldier and statesman, Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata in 1815.

==Early life==
He was born in Santo Ángel in the northern part of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate (now in Rio Grande do Sul) to a Spanish nobleman father, Diego de Alvear y Ponce de León, and a criolla mother, María Balbastro and baptised Carlos Antonio del Santo Ángel Guardián. His birthplace Santo Ángel was, at that time, part of Misiones Province, but currently belongs to the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.

While travelling to Spain with his family on board a Spanish Navy squadron in 1804, a Royal Navy fleet attacked the squadron on 5 October, capturing or destroying all four of the Spanish frigates present. The battle was a preamble to the Anglo-Spanish War between the two countries; during the engagement, Alvears&#x27;s brothers and mother were killed by stray cannon fire, though he survived the battle to be taken as a prisoner of war by the British along with his father to England. There, he would meet and marry an Irish woman.

Honouring his mother, Carlos de Alvear adopted the name of Carlos María de Alvear. During his stay in Britain, the 15-year-old Carlos was given an English-style education, adopting, in his adult age, what some would later see as a position amenable to British interests.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.

==Military career==
Alvear was one of the few professional military officers to participate in the Argentine War of Independence on the side of the revolutionaries, having served in the Spanish Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He became an active Freemason. While in Cadiz, he founded the&quot; Sociedad de los Caballeros Racionales&quot;, a masonic secret society, made up of South Americans. José de San Martín, with whom Alvear would always have a conflictive and contradictory relationship, would later also become a member of this secret society.

He returned to Buenos Aires on board the British merchantman &quot;George Canning&quot;, in which were also travelling San Martín, Juan Matías Zapiola, Francisco Chilavert and other soldiers. Upon his arrival, Alvear was named Lieutenant Coronel of the young Argentine army. He led the action against the Royal army under Gaspar Vigodet in Montevideo, replacing José Rondeau and making the Oriental leader José Gervasio Artigas an enemy.

Alvear was a leader of the constituent Assembly of the year 1813 and, goaded by political ambition, succeeded in establishing a &quot;Unitarian&quot; (centralizing) form of government, having his uncle Gervasio Antonio de Posadas named Supreme Director (chief executive).

In early 1814, Alvear was appointed commander in chief of the forces defending the capital. A few months later, he replaced General José Rondeau as commander in chief of the army besieging Montevideo, the last bastion of Spanish power in the River Plate, which was defended by 5,000 troops. In late June 1814, as news that Ferdinand VII had recovered the crown of Spain, Alvear managed to force the surrender of the Spanish troops in Montevideo. It was the biggest victory for the cause of independence since 1810. He was only 25 and the most successful general of the revolution. He returned to Buenos Aires to claim his laurels but a revolt forced him back to the Banda Oriental. After a quick and decisive campaign, his forces defeated the caudillos that opposed the government.

At the end of 1814 Alvear was named commander of the Army of the North, but he lacked of support from Posadas, and his unpopularity among the troops, and other disagreements—including a project for a constitutional monarchy that he sent to Europe to be negotiated by Manuel Belgrano, that was fiercely opposed by the League of Free Peoples—made him return to Buenos Aires. On January 9, 1815, at 25 years of age, he was chosen to replace his uncle Posadas as Supreme Director.

Having neither the support of the troops nor sufficient influence on the people of the hinterland provinces, Director Alvear then attempted to come to an alliance with Artigas, to whom he offered the independence of the Banda Oriental (current Uruguay). In exchange, Artigas would withdraw his army from the Argentine Littoral. But Artigas declined the offer, and Alvear sent troops to occupy the area.

At this time he was in correspondence with the British ambassador, Viscount Strangford in Rio de Janeiro, in order to ask for a British intervention. Following a mutiny among his troops, and under pressure from the Cabildo, Alvear resigned on April 15, and left the country. He was in exile in Rio de Janeiro until 1818. In May of that year, he moved to Montevideo where he joined his friend, the Chilean Jose Miguel Carrera, also exiled due to political differences with San Martin and Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins.

===Diplomatic missions to England, United States and Bolivia===
Alvear returned to Argentina in 1822 thanks to an amnesty law (&quot;Ley del olvido&quot;). At the end of 1823, Bernardino Rivadavia named him minister plenipotentiary to the United States. Before going to Washington, Alvear stopped in London and managed to get an interview with George Canning, the British Foreign Secretary. Weeks after this interview, the British government formally recognized the independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. In 1825, together with José Miguel Díaz Vélez, Carlos María de Alvear was sent by the Buenos Aires government to Bolivia to meet with Simón Bolívar. The real objective of the so-called Alvear-Díaz Velez Mission was to seek Bolívar&#x27;s support in the looming war with the Empire of Brazil, over the Banda Oriental. It was proposed that Bolívar should lead a Hispanic American alliance that can exert pressure on Dom Pedro I to withdraw his army stationed in the Eastern Province. The mission, which was created by an Act passed on May 9, 1825, gave Alvear and Díaz Vélez authority to negotiate and settle issues involving the liberation of the four provinces of Upper Peru. Alvear had also a project of his own: the creation of a big republic in South America comprising Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. He asked Bolívar to be its first president. The Venezuelan leader was sympathetic to this project but dissensions in Gran Colombia forced him to abandon it.

===War against the Empire of Brazil===
To neutralize Alvear&#x27;s political ambitions, newly elected President Bernardino Rivadavia appointed him his Minister of War and Navy in early 1826. In a short period of time, and with limited resources, Alvear was able to raise an army of 8.000 men to wage war against the Empire of Brazil. Conflicting claims over the Banda Oriental (which included current Uruguay) pushed both countries into conflict. Victory seemed unattainable to the Argentines. At the time, Brazil had a population of close to 5 million inhabitants (including 2 million slaves), a standing army of 120.000 men and a naval fleet of almost 80 vessels. In contrast, the fledgling Argentine Republic had only 700,000 inhabitants and faced the secession of almost half of its provinces.

Fearing a Brazilian invasion of Argentine territory, in mid-1826, President Rivadavia appointed Alvear as commander in chief of the Argentine army, which was in mutiny. Alvear quickly restored discipline and put the troops in fighting condition. By the end of the year, after only three months on the job, he took the initiative and launched an invasion of the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Among Alvear&#x27;s objectives was to promote a slave rebellion which would force the Emperor to seek an armistice.

During the first months of 1827 Cisplatine War, the Argentine Army entered Brazilian territory and defeated the Brazilians at Bagé, Ombú, Camacuá and the great Battle of Ituzaingó, probably the most important victory of his career. It was his brilliant and fearless conduct during this campaign, and the memorable victory which ended it, that made controversial Alvear a national hero among Argentine people ever since. However, internal dissensions in Argentina and the signing of what was perceived to be a humiliating peace treaty brought down Rivadavia&#x27;s presidency. Without any political backing or support from Buenos Aires. Alvear tendered his resignation and returned to Buenos Aires. When he arrived in the capital, he realized he had been removed by the new government, which did everything possible to discredit him and Rivadavia.

===Alvear and Rosas===
In 1829 Juan Manuel de Rosas appeared in the Argentine political scene, inaugurating a controversial regime that on and off would last almost 23 years. Alvear was one of the leaders of the opposition and, in 1832, Rosas appointed him ambassador to the United States, as a way of neutralizing his political ambitions. A change in government the following year allowed Alvear to remain in Buenos Aires. However, when Rosas returned to power in 1835, he again tried to get rid of Alvear, who he suspected was conspiring against his government.

===Argentina&#x27;s first ambassador to the United States===
In early 1837, after discovering evidence that linked Alvear to a new conspiracy, Rosas appointed him Argentina&#x27;s first minister plenipotentiary to the United States. However, he was only able to depart the following year. Alvear spent the rest of his life as ambassador in the U.S. and died in his house in New York in November 1852. During his residence in the United States, Alvear had the opportunity to meet and interact with important political figures such as Joel Roberts Poinsett, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and James Buchanan, among others. Alvear&#x27;s instructions were mostly concerned with obtaining an apology from the United States regarding the conduct of an American warship at the Falkland Islands, and to reassert Argentine claims to those islands. The U.S. government was indifferent to the Argentine claims. Seeing that nothing more could be expected from Washington, Alvear requested to be transferred to Europe, but Rosas refused. As the conflict between Argentina and France, and later Britain, intensified, Alvear tried to get the support of the United States arguing that it would be consistent with the Monroe Doctrine. At the time, however, the United States was more concerned about the situation in Texas and Oregon, so remained neutral in this conflict. Although a political enemy of Rosas, Alvear admired him for his firm advocacy for a military response to outside intervention.

Although he had been a lifelong admirer of the United States, after the annexation of Texas (1845) and the subsequent war with Mexico (1846–1848), Alvear became wary of American intentions towards Spanish America. According to his American biographer Thomas Davis, his diplomatic correspondence shaped Argentina&#x27;s traditional distrust to U.S. policies, which Alvear felt included the desire to conquer, or at least dominate, all of Latin America.

Carlos María de Alvear was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

==Legacy==
Bartolomé Mitre, author of the biography of San Martín &quot;Historia de San Martín y de la emancipación sudamericana&quot;, was very critical of Alvear, describing him as ambitious and dictatorial. Most later historians reject Alvear as well, albeit for different reasons. Leftist authors support Monteagudo but reject Alvear, despite their political relation. Revisionist authors, supporters of anti-imperialism, condemn Alvear for the attempt to turn the United Provinces into a British protectorate and relate him with the party of Bernardino Rivadavia, despite them being enemies.

<doc id="988095" wikidata="Q7228627" url="?curid=988095" title="Poole Pirates">
<text>Poole Pirates (also known as Poole Speedway) are a motorcycle speedway team based in Poole, England, competing in the SGB Championship. The club have been the champions of the United Kingdom on ten occasions.
Poole Speedway is promoted by local businessman Matt Ford and son Danny Ford, who took over promoting rights of the club in 1998. The team is managed by past rider and former Great Britain team manager Neil Middleditch. Poole Stadium (known as Wimborne Road when speedway takes place) has been home to the club since it was founded in 1948.

== History ==
=== Origins and 1940s ===

In 1947, Bournemouth based Exeter Falcons riders Tommy Crutcher and Charlie Hayden created a consortium, which also included Crutcher&#x27;s brother Jack and Herby Hayden, with the aim of opening a speedway club closer to their home. The consortium applied to Poole Borough Council in 1947 to stage speedway racing in the town and the council approved their request on 6 January 1948.

The home ground of the Poole Pirates would be Poole Stadium, which had been used primarily by Poole Town F.C. up to that point. The cycle track around the football pitch was replaced by a speedway track in preparation for the 1948 Speedway National League Division Three season. The first fixture held by the team was away to Tamworth Hounds, on 14 April 1948 and the first home match followed shortly afterwards, on 26 April against Yarmouth Bloaters.

Terry Small was signed for 1949, as the team improved on their inaugural season by finishing sixth.

=== 1950s ===

Tony Lewis and Ken Middleditch (the latter signed from Hastings) formed an effective pairing for the Pirates in 1950. Middleditch topped the league averages that season and led the Pirates to the runner-up position behind Oxford Cheetahs. Poole strengthened the team further by bringing in Brian Crutcher, Bill Holden and Roy Craighead, which resulted in the Pirates winning their first title in 1951 and subsequently being promoted to the National League Division Two. Crutcher became the first Poole rider to reach a World Speedway Final in 1952 and Ken Middleditch won the Riders&#x27; Championship.

Poole won the Division Two title and National Trophy (tier 2) double at the first attempt, but were denied first division status by the Speedway Control Board, who claimed that Poole were not a big enough club to be able to sustain top flight racing. The following two years (1953 and 1954) saw the Pirates narrowly finishing as Division Two runners up. Brian Crutcher left Poole for Wembley at the start of the 1953 season but Ken Middleditch won a second Riders&#x27; Championshiop in 1954.

In 1955, the Pirates again won the league and National Trophy double and were allowed promotion to division oOne of the National League, becoming the only club to ever have won promotion from the bottom league to the top tier. However, by the end of the 1956 season, the Poole promoters closed the club, blaming poor attendances and the introduction of fuel rationing due to the Suez Crisis. Despite losing their league status, Poole Stadium continued to stage meetings during 1957, including two National League meetings. Rayleigh Rockets promoter Vic Gooden took over the promoting rights of Poole at the end of the year and transferred his team to Poole, who rejoined the National League in 1958.

=== 1960s ===

Southampton Saints promoter Charles Knott took over from Vic Gooden in 1960 and brought back the successful pairing of Middleditch and Lewis. Ross Gilbertson was also signed and Geoff Mudge was brought over from Australia. The stadium was also redeveloped in 1960, with the track being made slightly smaller to accommodate a greyhound racing track. A sheltered 1,100 seat grandstand was erected on the home straight and is still in use. The league structure was re-formed and Poole opted to join the newly formed Provincial League. Poole finished joint top of the table with Rayleigh, but lost out on points difference. However, success returned to Poole with the Provincial League title in 1961 and 1962.

Following a power struggle between the Speedway Control Board and speedway club promoters, the British League was formed in 1965. Poole joined the British League (the top league Division) with 18 other teams and remained there for the next 20 years. They won the British League title in 1969 with Pete Smith, who would eventually go on to score over 3,287 points for the club, the biggest contributor. Smith was supported with contributions from team captain Geoff Mudge, Bruce Cribb, Gordon Guasco, Frank Shuter and Odd Fossengen who was in his second year at Poole and would become a fans favourite.
=== 1970s ===

Poole continued to race in the British League and major changes in personnel took place in 1974, with the arrival of riders such as Colin Gooddy and Neil Middleditch, son of former rider Ken Middleditch. In 1975, Poole completed the signing of Malcolm Simmons from King&#x27;s Lynn. Simmons finished top of the Poole riders averages for the next six seasons and in 1976 finished in second place at the Speedway World Championship.

Mid-way through the 1979 season, Reg Fearman bought the promoting rights to run the club but ultimately the decade was one of mediocrity.

=== 1980s ===
Fearman continued to promote the club until 1984, when financial debts of £200,000 forced the club to close. However, the club was rescued by the then Weymouth Wildcats promoters Peter Ansell and Mervyn Stewkesbury, who moved their team to Poole for the start of the 1985 season. The team name was changed to the Poole Wildcats and they entered the National League – the second league tier of speedway. The name change proved to be unpopular and was reverted to the Poole Pirates after two seasons, although the Wildcats did finish runner-up in the league during both the 1985 and 1986 seasons.

Australian manager Neil Street was appointed as Poole team manager and an influx of young Australian riders began to arrive, including Craig Boyce in 1988 and Leigh Adams in 1989. Poole finished as National League runners up 1988, were National League champions in 1989.

=== 1990s ===

Led by captain Alun Rossiter and despite losing Leigh Adams, the Pirates won the League and Knockout Cup double in 1990. After the 1990 season, Poole re-joined the top flight of speedway – the British League. Poole won the league championship in 1994 led by Boyce, 1993 signing Lars Gunnestad, veteran Steve Schofield and a young Jason Crump, grandson of manager Neil Street. The Pirates also won the fours championship final, held at the East of England Arena on 7 August.

In 1997, the structure of the leagues was once again changed with Poole joining the Elite League. The terracing on the back straight of the speedway track was demolished in 1997 and replaced with a new glass fronted grandstand incorporating a 440-seat restaurant, two bars, Tote betting facilities and multiple viewing screens. The speedway track was reduced in size to to accommodate a new greyhound track. Stadia UK were issued a long-term lease on the stadium by the council, with the Pirates promotion sub-leasing use of the stadium and facilities from Stadia UK.

Poole initially struggled in the Elite League and were sold to local businessmen Matt Ford and Mike Golding in 1998. In a clear out at the club, only Magnus Zetterström remained from the 1998 season and Neil Street was replaced as manager by former rider Neil Middleditch. Craig Boyce left for Oxford Cheetahs, Lee Richardson was signed from Reading Racers, Gary Havelock was brought in as captain and Mark Loram was signed from Wolverhampton Wolves. Poole finished as Elite League runner up in 1999.

=== 2000s ===

Mark Loram was to become the first Pirate to lift the World Championship title with his success in 2000 and in 2001, the Pirates signed Tony Rickardsson, won the World Championship that year. Rickardsson led the Pirates to another runner-up position during the league campaign, in addition to winning the Craven Shield.

In 2002, the club signed Bjarne Pedersen as they won another Craven Shield but it was Rickardsson who set the headlines for the season, winning another World Championhsip, the Riders&#x27; Championship and topping the league averages.

Leigh Adams re-joined the club in 2003, spearheading the team to a triple championship of Elite League, Knockout Cup and the British League Cup. The Pirates followed up 2003 with another successful year in 2004 despite the loss of Grand Prix rider Leigh Adams. Solid point scoring from Bjarne Pedersen, Antonio Lindback and Ryan Sullivan led Poole to an Elite League and Knockout Cup double and Poole became the first top flight club to achieve back to back League and Cup doubles since 1960.

After signing Chris Holder and re-signing Davey Watt and Krzysztof Kasprzak, the Pirates won their third Elite League championship in 2008, defeating the Lakeside Hammers in the play-off final with an aggregate score of 108–75.

The decade ended with Hans Andersen and Chris Holder winning the Elite League Pairs Championship, held at the Arlington Stadium on 8 August 2009. Poole operated a junior team called Bournemouth Buccaneers, in the National League in 2009.

=== 2010s ===

The Pirates finished 20 points clear of nearest rivals Wolves, during the 2010 season but lost to Coventry Bees in the play off final. The team did however take consolation from winning the Knockout Cup. The following season in 2011, the Pirates somewhat aggrieved after the 2010 season, dominated the league, led by Darcy Ward and Chris Holder and finished the season off by defeating the Eastbourne Eagles in the play-off final. They team completed a treble of trophy wins by winning the Knockout Cup and Pairs.

The success of Poole continued with a third consecutive Knockout Cup win in 2012. The Pirates were then crowned champions in three successive years during the 2013, 2014 and 2015 seasons. The team won their tenth highest league title after winning the SGB Premiership 2018.

The decade was Poole&#x27;s most successful period of speedway throughout their history and the south coast team were the leading club during the decade, with many top riders appearing for the club, most notably Holder, Ward, Watt, Pedersen, Andersen and Maciej Janowski.

=== 2020s ===
After the leagues were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Pirates returned to action in the second tier SGB Championship. They finished top of the regular season table and secured a place in the playoff final against Glasgow, before winning the division 2 Knockout Cup for the third time in their history and then completed the league and cup double by winning the play off final. The team was led by Steve Worrall and Danny King.

The following season in 2022, the Pirate brought in Richard Lawson and the success continued as the team dominated again, winning the SGB Championship and Knockout Cup &#x27;double double&#x27;. In 2023, despite winning the early season BSN Series, the Pirates suffered a shock play off final loss to Glasgow, which prevented a third consecutive league title win.

In 2024, the team made amends for the 2023 loss by winning their third league title and knockout cup in four years and securing a treble by winning the BSN Series.

<text>W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company was a precursor to Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre.

It was founded in 1902 by two Irish brothers, William and Frank Fay. In the 1890&#x27;s, William had worked with a touring company in Ireland,Scotland and Wales while Frank was heavily involved in amateur dramatics in Dublin. After William returned, the brothers began to stage productions in halls around the city. Later, they established the company, which focused on the development of Irish acting talent.

Participants included Máire Nic Shiubhlaigh, Helen Laird, Máire T. Quinn, Brian Callender, Charles Caulfield, James H. Cousins and Dudley Digges. Their first production, Cathleen Ni Houlihan, was on 2 April 1902. In March 1903 came the first production of &quot;The Hour-Glass&quot;. The company acquired rooms at 34 Lower Camden St., which they turned into a small theatre. In 1903 the playwrights and most of the actors went on to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which had its registered offices in Camden St., and which later became the Abbey Theatre.

<text>Ivan Moody (11 June 1964 in London – 18 January 2024 in Lisbon) was a British composer and musicologist.

Moody was active as a conductor, having directed ensembles such as Voces Angelicae, the Kastalsky Chamber Choir (United Kingdom), Capilla Peña Florida (Spain), Cappella Romana (United States), the Choir of the Cathedral of St George, Novi Sad (Serbia), the KotorArt Festival Choir (Montenegro), the Orthodox Choir of the University of Joensuu (Finland) and Ensemble Alpha (Portugal); and as a widely published musicologist. His research interests included the music of Eastern Europe, especially 20th century and contemporary music from Russia and the Balkans, the music of the Orthodox Church in the modern era, music and spirituality, music as theology, Serbian church music, the aesthetics of Modernism and Postmodernism and their intersection with Orthodox church music and the musical culture of the Mediterranean. 

Ivan Moody&#x27;s music is recorded on the Hyperion, ECM, Sony, Challenge, Telarc, Gothic, Oehms, Orange Mountain, Linn and Cappella Romana labels.

==Early life==
Ivan Moody was born in London on 11 June 1964. He studied composition at Royal Holloway College, in London and privately with John Tavener; he took his doctorate in the University of York. He also studied Eastern Orthodox Theology at the University of Joensuu in Finland.

== Work from the 1980s and 1990s ==
Moody&#x27;s compositions show the influences of Eastern liturgical chant and the Eastern Orthodox Church, of which he was a member (He converted to Orthodoxy in 1988, being received in the Russian Cathedral in London. Ivan worked very hard to help creating an Orthodox Church with regular Liturgies in Lisbon, Portugal, where he was living, for there was no regular service and with the opening of the borders and the migration of lots of eastern orthodox people to Portugal in the 90s made it even more necessary. He was ordained Priest by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2004, later becoming a protopresbyter of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. He was transferred to the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2022. His &quot;Canticum Canticorum I&quot;, written for the Hilliard Ensemble and premiered in 1987, achieved enormous success and remains his most frequently-performed work, and in 1990 he won the Arts for the Earth Festival Prize for &quot;Prayer for the Forests&quot;, subsequently premièred by the renowned Tapiola Choir of Finland. One of his most important works is the oratorio &quot;Passion and Resurrection&quot; (1992), based on Orthodox liturgical texts, premièred in 1993 by Red Byrd and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir under Tõnu Kaljuste at the Tampere Festival. In 1996 it was given its North American premiere by Cappella Romana. &quot;The Akáthistos Hymn&quot; (1998), the composer&#x27;s largest work to date, and the first complete musical setting of this text, was written for Cappella Romana following these performances.

Other significant works include the &#x27;cello concerto &quot;Epitaphios&quot; (1993), the cantata &quot;Revelation&quot; (1995), &quot;Endechas y Canciones&quot; (1996), the recorder concerto &quot;Pnevma&quot; (1998), &quot;Lamentations of the Myrrhbearer&quot; (2001) for string quartet, &quot;Lumière sans déclin&quot; (2000) for string orchestra, and the choral triptych written for Trio Mediaeval - &quot;Words of the Angel&quot; (1998), &quot;Troparion of Kassiani&quot; (1999), &quot;A Lion&#x27;s Sleep&quot; (2002), and &quot;Chalice of Wisdom&quot;, using a text from Matins of the Feast of St Thomas, written in 2002 for the ensemble amarcord.

<doc id="988110" wikidata="Q12640264" url="?curid=988110" title="History of field hockey">
<text>Field hockey is a popular game possibly depicted on walls in Egypt. Drawings of what looks to be hockey have been found in an Egyptian tomb that was 4000 years old. Hockey is a popular game in India and Pakistan. It was played for hundreds of years before other countries like England modernised it. Hockey is similar to an ancient game played in Scotland called shinty. Hockey is often played at schools in the UK but its origins are unclear. Later came ice hockey, which developed in Canada.

==Games similar to hockey outside the Mediterranean World==
In Inner Mongolia, China, the Daur people have been playing Beikou (a game similar to modern field hockey) for about 1,000 years. European settlers in Chile in the 16th century described a hockey-like game of the Araucano Indians called &quot;chueca&quot; (or &#x27;the twisted one&#x27; from the twisted end of the stick used by players). In Western Australia, early white settlers witnessed Noongar people played a game called &quot;dumbung&quot;, in which bent sticks were used to hit a ball made of dried sap from the native peartree. (The game is believed to be the source of the name of Dumbleyung, a town near where it was played.)
In Punjab, there is a traditional hockey-like game known as &quot;khido khundi&quot;, roughly translating to &quot;ball and blunt stick&quot;.

==Modern hockey==
A game called hockey was played in English public schools in the early 19th century. Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that &quot;On the common some young men were playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in England, except at schools...&quot;. Hockey&#x27;s popularity increased with that of other team games. A version of the game played in south-east London was rougher than the modern version, played on a very large field (247m by 64m), and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks. The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs, especially Teddington Hockey Club. The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise, but did not particularly care for football. In 1870, members of the Teddington cricket club, who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park, were looking for a winter activity. They experimented with a &#x27;stick&#x27; game, based loosely on the rules of association football.
Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball, so allowing smooth and predictable motion. By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game, including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it. An association was formed in 1875, which dissolved after seven years, but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge. Blackheath were one of the founder members, but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union. The Union failed, but the Association grew rapidly.

They rejected a form of the game that involved a rubber cube, catching, marking and scrimmaging, based on rugby football, at the time favoured by the Blackheath club. The Teddington club chose to limit the number per side to eleven, and preferred to play with old cricket balls. They also introduced the idea of the striking circle (&#x27;the dee&#x27; or &#x27;D&#x27;), and they played several games in Bushy Park, in the winter of 1871. Clubs were also set up in Richmond and Surbiton in
1874, and inter-club matches were played between them and Teddington. The game grew sporadically, as the clubs did not always agree on the rules!

In the late 19th century, largely due to the British Army, the game spread throughout the British Empire, leading to the first international competition in 1895 (Ireland 3, Wales 0). The International Rules Board was founded in 1895, and hockey first appeared at the Olympic Games as a men&#x27;s competition at 1908 Olympic Games in London, with only three teams: England, Ireland and Scotland. Men&#x27;s hockey became a permanent fixture at the Olympics at the 1928 Olympic Games, at Amsterdam.

The first step towards an international structuring occurred in 1909, when England and Belgium agreed to recognize each other for international competitions, soon joined in by the French federation. In 1924, the &quot;International Hockey Federation&quot; (FIH, &quot;Fédération Internationale de Hockey&quot;) was founded in Paris, under the initiative of the French man, Paul Léautey, as a response to hockey&#x27;s omission from the 1924 Paris Games. The founding members were Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Spain, and Switzerland. The development of the FIH owes a lot to the work of Réné George Frank, a Belgian, in the years after the Second World War until the 1970s. Men&#x27;s hockey united under the FIH in 1970, when the Hockey Association joined and the International Rules Board became part of the FIH&#x27;s structure.

The game had been taken to India by British servicemen, and the first clubs formed there in Calcutta in 1885. The Beighton Cup and the Aga Khan tournament had commenced within ten years. Entering the Olympic Games in 1928, India won all five of its games without conceding a goal, and went on to win in 1932 until 1956, and then in 1964 and 1980. Pakistan won in 1960, 1968, and 1984.

==Women&#x27;s hockey==

Women&#x27;s hockey developed separately from men&#x27;s hockey. Women do not seem to have played hockey widely before the modern era. Women&#x27;s hockey was first played at British Universities and schools, and the first club, Molesey Ladies Hockey Club, was founded in 1887. The first national association was the Irish Ladies Hockey Union in 1894, and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women&#x27;s hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the formation of the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Hockey Associations (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include initially many continental European countries where women played as sections of men&#x27;s associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and the tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.

By the early 1970s there were 22 associations with women&#x27;s sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions were started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women&#x27;s hockey to the 1980 Olympic Games, where, as in the men&#x27;s game, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands have been consistently strong. Due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott by many of the dominant nations at the time, Zimbabwe won the inaugural women&#x27;s event with a fully amateur team.

Since 1980 women&#x27;s attire has changed with miniskirts replacing pleated skirts for female outfield players and umpires, but concerns of embarrassment for girls led to shorts being allowed from 2023 onwards.

==The synthetic revolution==

In the early 1970s, the &quot;synthetic grass&quot; fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at the 1976 Montreal edition.

Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and most national competitions. While hockey is still played on grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic turf almost everywhere in the western world.

The introduction of artificial surfaces has changed the game. To take into account the specificities of this surface, new tactics and new techniques (such as the Indian dribble) have been developed and new rules have been introduced to control these new techniques.

Regarding the evolution of the hockey player material, the sticks have changed shape, with the bent head at the bottom, which used to be about 15 centimetres long, becoming much stubbier. The extra length was no longer necessary, as the ball travelled much straighter on the flatter synthetic fields. The shorter length made playing the ball with the &quot;backhand&quot; (playing with the head of the stick to the player&#x27;s left, with the head rotated 180 degrees from its usual position) much easier, increasing the speed with which this tactic, often used for evasive manoeuvres, could be used. It also makes trapping the ball by placing the entire stick on the ground, with the point of the head resting on the ground to the player&#x27;s left, possible, and this stopping technique is now universal for trapping the ball at penalty corners. The sticks have also tended to become stiffer as to hit the ball harder. Fibreglass, carbon fibre and kevlar were first applied to the traditional wood core in the early 1970s. Sticks with an aluminium core have been produced but are now prohibited due to the danger they pose when broken. Wooden sticks are less and less common, and players are now playing with sticks entirely made of synthetic composite materials.

The goalkeeper equipment has followed the same trend, becoming more and more able to resist to strength of the balls hit by these new generation sticks. Helmets have become compulsory, padding is thicker and of more shock-absorbing (and reflecting) foam material and more areas of the body are padded. The new equipment is very expensive and is often a considerable burden for clubs or individual goalkeepers to purchase. The composition of the hockey ball has also changed, from a leather ball with a seam similar to a cricket ball, to a seamless, usually dimpled hard plastic ball. These plastic balls are cheaper, more durable, more consistent in their behaviour, and are unaffected by water; a key requirement in water-moderated synthetic fields used in elite-level hockey.

Ancillary player equipment has also changed. The studded boots for grass fields are banned (and were in any case very uncomfortable) on synthetics, and have been replaced with boots specifically designed for synthetic turf. Shin guards have improved padding. Many players have taken to wearing padded gloves, particularly on their left hand, both to protect against contact and allow them to scrape that hand (while holding the stick) across the synthetic turf without injury. Finally, the wearing of mouthguards to protect the teeth is now compulsory for safety in many countries.

== Rules ==
The rules of the game have widely changed. The main issues have been
* To adapt the game to the new synthetic fields introduced in the 1980s.
* To enhance comprehension from non-players to gain TV coverage

Some of these rules changes:
* The FIH eliminated the offside rule (similar to offside in football) in the mid-1990s to increase scoring opportunities.
* Constant modifications of the penalty corner rules to minimize its importance in the game and its readability.
* Limitation of the bow of sticks to limit the increasing use and power of drag flicks.

<doc id="988112" wikidata="Q5342542" url="?curid=988112" title="Edward Davison (poet)">
<text>Edward Lewis Davison (1898–1970) was a Scottish poet and critic, born in Glasgow, who later moved to the United States.

Davison grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1914 he joined the navy, where he rose to lieutenant. After the end of World War I he matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge on a scholarship; it was while at Cambridge that he edited an anthology of student poetry and met the writer J. B. Priestley, who would remain a lifelong friend. Davison emigrated to the United States in 1925, and became an academic, teaching at Vassar College, the University of Miami, and the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was involved in the Colorado Writers 1937 conference. He was a friend of Robert Frost.

The poet Peter Davison is his son.

He was widely published as a poet in the 1920s, featured in the J. C. Squire anthologies, and became known as a writer of sonnets.
His &quot;Be Thou At Peace&quot; has been set to music by John Raynor.

==Military career==
Davison joined the United States Army in 1943, shortly after becoming a Naturalized citizen of the United States. He had previously served as a paymaster in the Royal Navy. During World War II, Davison attained the rank of Lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. He was named director of the Special Projects Division, which was responsible for overseeing the re-education of German prisoners of war. Many of Davidson&#x27;s poems from this time-frame appear to express doubts about the mission he had been assigned. Davidson had no knowledge of German language, culture, or politics, and so struggled to craft a suitable program.

<text>A data logger (also datalogger or data recorder) is an electronic device that records data over time or about location either with a built-in instrument or sensor or via external instruments and sensors. Increasingly, but not entirely, they are based on a digital processor (or computer), and called digital data loggers (DDL). They generally are small, battery-powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and sensors. Some data loggers interface with a personal computer and use software to activate the data logger and view and analyze the collected data, while others have a local interface device (keypad, LCD) and can be used as a stand-alone device.

Data loggers vary from general-purpose devices for various measurement applications to very specific devices for measuring in one environment or application type only. While it is common for general-purpose types to be programmable, many remain static machines with only a limited number or no changeable parameters. Electronic data loggers have replaced chart recorders in many applications.

One primary benefit of using data loggers is their ability to automatically collect data on a 24-hour basis. Upon activation, data loggers are typically deployed and left unattended to measure and record information for the duration of the monitoring period. This allows for a comprehensive, accurate picture of the environmental conditions being monitored, such as air temperature and relative humidity.

The cost of data loggers has been declining over the years as technology improves and costs are reduced. Simple single-channel data loggers can cost as little as $25, while more complicated loggers may cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.

== Data formats ==
Standardization of protocols and data formats has been a problem but is now growing in the industry and XML, JSON, and YAML are increasingly being adopted for data exchange. The development of the Semantic Web and the Internet of Things is likely to accelerate this present trend.

== Instrumentation protocols ==
Several protocols have been standardized including a smart protocol, SDI-12, that allows some instrumentation to be connected to a variety of data loggers. The use of this standard has not gained much acceptance outside the environmental industry. SDI-12 also supports multi-drop instruments. Some data logging companies support the MODBUS standard. This has been used traditionally in the industrial control area, and many industrial instruments support this communication standard. Another multi-drop protocol that is now starting to become more widely used is based upon CAN-Bus (ISO 11898). Some data loggers use a flexible scripting environment to adapt to various non-standard protocols.

== Data logging versus data acquisition ==
The terms data logging and data acquisition are often used interchangeably. However, in a historical context, they are quite different. A data logger is a data acquisition system, but a data acquisition system is not necessarily a data logger.

* Data loggers typically have slower sample rates. A maximum sample rate of 1 Hz may be considered to be very fast for a data logger, yet very slow for a typical data acquisition system.
* Data loggers are implicitly stand-alone devices, while typical data acquisition systems must remain tethered to a computer to acquire data. This stand-alone aspect of data loggers implies onboard memory that is used to store acquired data. Sometimes this memory is very large to accommodate many days, or even months, of unattended recording. This memory may be battery-backed static random access memory, flash memory, or EEPROM. Earlier data loggers used magnetic tape, punched paper tape, or directly viewable records such as &quot;strip chart recorders&quot;.
* Given the extended recording times of data loggers, they typically feature a mechanism to record the date and time in a timestamp to ensure that each recorded data value is associated with a date and time of acquisition to produce a sequence of events. As such, data loggers typically employ built-in real-time clocks whose published drift can be an important consideration when choosing between data loggers.
* Data loggers range from simple single-channel input to complex multi-channel instruments. Typically, the simpler the device the less programming flexibility. Some more sophisticated instruments allow for cross-channel computations and alarms based on predetermined conditions. The newest data loggers can serve web pages, allowing numerous people to monitor a system remotely.
* The unattended and remote nature of many data logger applications implies the need for some applications to operate from a DC power source, such as a battery. Solar power may be used to supplement these power sources. These constraints have generally led to ensuring that the devices they market are extremely power efficient relative to computers. In many cases, they are required to operate in harsh environmental conditions where computers will not function reliably.
* This unattended nature also dictates that data loggers must be extremely reliable. Since they may operate for long periods nonstop with little or no human supervision and may be installed in harsh or remote locations, it is imperative that so long as they have power, they will not fail to log data for any reason. Manufacturers go to great lengths to ensure that the devices can be depended on in these applications. As such data loggers are almost completely immune to the problems that might affect a general-purpose computer in the same application, such as program crashes and the instability of some operating systems.

== Applications ==

Applications of data logging include:
* Unattended weather station recording (such as wind speed / direction, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation).
* Unattended hydrographic recording (such as water level, water depth, water flow, water pH, water conductivity).
* Unattended soil moisture level recording.
* Unattended gas pressure recording.
* Offshore buoys for recording a variety of environmental conditions.
* Road traffic counting.
* Measure temperatures (humidity, etc.) of perishables during shipments: Cold chain.
* Measure variations in light intensity.
* Measuring temperature of pharmaceutical products, medicines and vaccines during storage
* Measuring temperature and humidity of perishable products during transportation to ensure cold chain is maintained 
* Process monitoring for maintenance and troubleshooting applications.
* Process monitoring to verify warranty conditions
* Wildlife research with pop-up archival tags
* Measure vibration and handling shock (drop height) environment of distribution packaging.
* Tank level monitoring.
* Deformation monitoring of any object with geodetic or geotechnical sensors controlled by an automatic deformation monitoring system.
* Environmental monitoring.
* Vehicle testing (including crash testing)
* Motor racing
* Monitoring of relay status in railway signaling.
* For science education enabling &#x27;measurement&#x27;, &#x27;scientific investigation&#x27; and an appreciation of &#x27;change&#x27;
* Record trend data at regular intervals in veterinary vital signs monitoring.
* Load profile recording for energy consumption management.
* Temperature, humidity and power use for heating and air conditioning efficiency studies.
* Water level monitoring for groundwater studies.
* Digital electronic bus sniffer for debug and validation

=== Examples ===
* Black-box (stimulus/response) loggers: 
** A flight data recorder (FDR) is a piece of recording equipment used to collect specific aircraft performance data. The term may also be used, albeit less accurately, to describe the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), another type of data recording device found on board aircraft.
** An event data recorder (EDR) is a device installed by the manufacturer in some automobiles which collects and stores various data during the time-frame immediately before and after a crash.
** A voyage data recorder (VDR) is a data recording system designed to collect data from various sensors on board a ship.
** A train event recorder is a device that records data about the operation of train controls and performance in response to those controls and other train control systems.
** An accident data recorder (ADR) is a device for triggering accidents or incidents in most kind of land vehicles and recording the relevant data. In automobiles, all diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) are logged in engine control units (ECUs) so that at the time of service of a vehicle, a service engineer will read all the DTCs using Tech-2 or similar tools connected to the on-board diagnostics port, and will come to know problems occurred in the vehicle. Sometimes a small OBD data logger is plugged into the same port to continuously record vehicle data.
** In embedded system and digital electronics design, specialized high-speed digital data logger help overcome the limitations of more traditional instruments such as the oscilloscope and the logic analyzer. The main advantage of a data logger is its ability to record very long traces, which proves very useful when trying to correct functional bugs that happen once in while.
** In the racing industry, Data Loggers are used to record data such as braking points, lap/sector timing, and track maps, as well as any on-board vehicle sensors.
* Health data loggers:
** The growing, preparation, storage and transportation of food. Data logger is generally used for data storage and these are small in size.
** A Holter monitor is a portable device for continuously monitoring various electrical activity of the cardiovascular system for at least 24 hours.
** Electronic health record loggers.
* Other general data acquisition loggers:
** An (scientific) experimental testing data acquisition tool.
** Ultra Wideband Data Recorder, high-speed data recording up to 2 Giga Samples per second.

== Future directions ==
Data Loggers are changing more rapidly now than ever before. The original model of a stand-alone data logger is changed to one of a device that collects data but also has access to wireless communications for alarming of events, automatic reporting of data, and remote control. Data loggers are beginning to serve web pages for current readings, e-mail their alarms, and FTP their daily results into databases or direct to the users. Very recently, there is a trend to move away from proprietary products with commercial software to open-source software and hardware devices. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer is among others a popular platform hosting real-time Linux or preemptive-kernel Linux operating systems with many

* digital interfaces like I2C, SPI, or UART enable the direct interconnection of a digital sensor and a computer,
* and an unlimited number of configurations to show measurements in real-time over the internet, process data, plot charts, and diagrams...

<doc id="988122" wikidata="Q1072592" url="?curid=988122" title="Battle of Spion Kop">
<text>The Battle of Spion Kop (; ) was a military engagement between British forces and two Boer Republics, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, during the campaign by the British to relieve the besieged city Ladysmith during the initial months of the Second Boer War. The battle was fought 23–24 January 1900 on the hilltop of Spioen Kop(a), about west-southwest of Ladysmith and resulted in a Boer victory.

==Prelude==

===Planning and crossing the Tugela===
General Sir Redvers Buller, VC, commander of the British forces in Natal, was attempting to relieve a British force besieged in Ladysmith. The Boers under General Louis Botha held the Tugela River against him. Although Botha&#x27;s men were outnumbered, they were mostly equipped with modern Mauser rifles and up-to-date field guns, and had carefully entrenched their positions. In late December, 1899, Buller made a frontal assault on the Boer positions at the Battle of Colenso. The result was a heavy British defeat.

Over the next few weeks, Buller received further reinforcements, and also acquired sufficient carts and transport to operate away from the railway line which was his main supply line. Buller devised a new plan of attack to relieve Ladysmith. His army was to launch a two-pronged offensive designed to cross the Tugela River at two points and create a bridgehead. They would then attack the defensive line that blocked Buller&#x27;s advance to Ladysmith. The area was only from Ladysmith. Buller delegated control of his main force to General Sir Charles Warren, to cross at Trichardt&#x27;s Drift. Buller would then send a second smaller force, under Major-General Neville Lyttelton to attack east of Warren&#x27;s force as a diversion at Potgieter&#x27;s Drift. Once across the Tugela, the British would attack the Boer defensive positions and then cross the open plains to relieve Ladysmith.

Warren&#x27;s force numbered 11,000 infantry, 2,200 cavalry, and 36 field guns. (2nd and 5th Divisions). On the 11th they marched westward to cross the Little Tugela and take up position in front of Potgieter&#x27;s Ferry. However their march was easily visible to the Boers, and so slow (due in part to the massive baggage trains necessary to British officers at the time – Warren&#x27;s included a cast-iron bathroom and well-equipped kitchen) that by the time they arrived at the Tugela, the Boers had entrenched a new position covering it. On the 18th, British mounted troops under the Earl of Dundonald enterprisingly reached the extreme Boer right flank, from where there was little to stop them riding to Ladysmith, but Warren recalled them to guard the force&#x27;s baggage. Once all his force had crossed the river, Warren sent part of the 2nd Division under Lieutenant-General Francis Clery against the Boer right flank positions on a plateau named Tabanyama. The Boers had once again entrenched a new position on the reverse slopes of the plateau, and Clery&#x27;s attack made no progress. Meanwhile, the secondary British attack by Lyttelton at Potgieter&#x27;s Drift had yet to commence in full.

==Battle==
Spion Kop, just northeast of Warren&#x27;s force, was the largest hill in the region, being over in height (relative height from its base). It lay almost exactly at the centre of the Boer line. If the British could capture this position and bring artillery to the hill then they would command the flanks of the surrounding Boer positions. On the night of 23 January, Warren sent part of his force, comprising a battalion (eight companies) of the Lancashire Fusiliers under Major-General Blomfield and a mixed battalion (six companies from the Royal Lancaster Regiment and two companies of South Lancashire Regiment) under Major-General Edward Woodgate, to secure Spion Kop. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Thorneycroft was selected to lead the initial assault. (Thorneycroft was one of six &quot;special service&quot; officers, among who were also Robert Baden-Powell and Herbert Plumer, despatched to South Africa shortly before the war to recruit local irregular corps. Thorneycroft&#x27;s mounted infantry were raised in Natal and numbered 360.)

The British climbed up the hill at night and in dense mist. They surprised the small Boer piquet and drove them off the kop at bayonet point. Of the 15 men in the Boer piquet, one was mortally wounded and his grave lies on the hill to this day. Ten British soldiers were wounded in the charge. The surviving Boers retreated down the hill to their camp waking up their fellow Boers by screaming &quot;Die Engelse is op die kop!&quot; (The English are on the hill!). A half-company of British sappers began to entrench the position with a mere 20 picks and 20 shovels (while almost 1,000 soldiers stood around idle) and Woodgate notified Warren of the successful capture of the hilltop.

As dawn broke, the British discovered that they held only the smaller and lower part of the hilltop of Spion Kop, while the Boers occupied higher ground on three sides of the British position. The British had no direct knowledge of the topography of the summit and the darkness and fog had compounded the problem. Furthermore, the British trenches were inadequate for all defensive purposes. Because the summit of the kop was mostly hard rock, the trenches were at most deep and provided an exceptionally poor defensive position – the British infantry in the trenches could not see over the crest of the plateau and the Boers were able to fire down the length of the crescent-shaped trench from the adjacent peaks.

The Boer generals were not unduly concerned by the news that the British had taken the kop. They knew that their artillery on Tabanyama could be brought to bear on the British position and that rifle fire could be brought to bear from parts of the kop not yet occupied by the British. However, the Boer generals also knew that sniping and artillery alone would not be sufficient to dislodge the British – and the Boer position was desperately vulnerable. If the British immediately established positions on Conical Hill and Aloe Knoll (the two unoccupied kopjes on the kop itself) they could bring their artillery to bear on Tabanyama, threatening the key Boer positions there. More importantly, there was a risk that the British would storm Trinity Peaks &quot;(Drielingkoppe)&quot; to the eastern end of Spion Kop. If Twin Peaks fell, the British would be able to turn the Boers&#x27; left flank and annihilate the main Boer encampment. The Boer generals realised that Spioen Kop would have to be stormed quickly if certain defeat were to be averted.

The Boer artillery began to bombard the British position, dropping shells from the adjacent plateau of Tabanyama at a rate of ten rounds per minute. Meanwhile, Commandant Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (1861–1900) of the Carolina Commando captured Aloe Knoll and Conical Hill with some 88 men, while around 300 burghers, mainly of the Pretoria Commando, climbed the kop to frontal assault on the British position. Prinsloo told his men: &quot;&quot;Burghers&quot;, we&#x27;re now going in to attack the enemy and we shan&#x27;t all be coming back. Do your duty and trust in the Lord.&quot; Minutes later, hundreds of Boers swarmed in to attack the British positions at the Spion Kop crestline, much to the surprise of the British. It was very unusual for the Boers to launch a daytime massed attack quickly resulting in vicious, close-quarters combat. This was not a custom of the Boers&#x27; style of warfare. The British Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield rifles were no less effective than the Boer Mauser rifles. However, the British excelled in close combat; albeit the surprise of the unusually direct Boer attack likely aided the Boer in the early stages of the engagement. Both sides exchanged fire at close range and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, with the British wielding fixed bayonets and the Boers wielding hunting knives and their own rifles used as bludgeons. After suffering serious losses, the Boer assault carried the crest line after several minutes of brutal hand-to-hand combat, but could advance no further. 

Over the next several hours, a kind of stalemate settled over the kop. The Boers had failed to drive the British from the kop, but the surviving men of the Pretoria and Carolina commando now held a firing line on Aloe Knoll from where they could enfilade the British position and the British were now under sustained bombardment from the Boer artillery. The British had failed to exploit their initial success, and the initiative now passed to the Boers. 



Morale began to sag on both sides as the extreme heat, exhaustion and thirst took hold. On the one hand the Boers on the kop could see large numbers of burghers on the plains below them who refused to join the fight. A sense of betrayal, the bloody failure of the frontal assault, the indiscipline inherent in a civilian army and the apparent security of the British position proved too much for some Boers, who began to abandon their hard-won positions. On the other hand, the bombardment began to take its toll on the British. Woodgate fell at about 08:30, mortally wounded by a shell splinter. In quick succession, Colonel Blomfield of the Lancashire Fusiliers took command but was wounded soon after Woodgate&#x27;s death, while the sappers&#x27; officer, Major H.H.Massy, and Woodgate&#x27;s brigade major, Captain N.H. Vertue, were killed. Officers and men from different units were intermingled, and the British were now leaderless, confused and pinned down by the heavy Boer artillery and rifle fire. The British artillery, positioned lower down the slopes of Spion Kop, were unable to hit back at the Boer guns. The British artillery was also missing their marks, causing one soldier to remark in his diary of the events &quot;our gunners, by the inaccuracy of their fire did far more damage to our front line of infantry than to the Boers!&quot;

Colonel Malby Crofton of the Royal Lancasters took charge and semaphored a plea for help, &quot;Reinforce at once or all is lost. General dead.&quot; After that the stunned colonel failed to exercise any leadership. Thorneycroft seems to have taken charge, leading a spirited counterattack that failed in the face of withering fire.

Warren had already dispatched Major-General John Talbot Coke&#x27;s brigade of two regular battalions and the Imperial Light Infantry (raised in Durban) to reinforce the summit. However, he refused to launch an attack on Tabanyama and barred his guns from firing on Aloe Knoll, believing this to be part of the British position. At 11:40, Buller, who could see that things were not going well, suggested to Warren that Thorneycroft be appointed commander on the kop. The first runner to Thorneycroft was shot dead before he could utter a word. Finally, a second runner brought the news, &quot;You are a general.&quot;

Winston Churchill was a journalist stationed in South Africa and had been commissioned as a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse by General Buller after his well-publicised escape from Boer captivity. Churchill acted as a courier to and from Spion Kop and Buller&#x27;s headquarters and made a statement about the scene: &quot;Corpses lay here and there. Many of the wounds were of a horrible nature. The splinters and fragments of the shells had torn and mutilated them. The shallow trenches were choked with dead and wounded.&quot;

About 13:00, the situation proved too much for some men of the Lancashire Fusiliers who attempted to surrender. Thorneycroft personally intervened and shouted at the Boers who advanced to round up prisoners, &quot;I&#x27;m the commandant here; take your men back to hell sir. I allow no surrenders.&quot; Fortunately for Thorneycroft, the first of the British reinforcements arrived at this moment. A vicious point-blank firefight ensued but the British line had been saved. At 14:30, Thorneycroft sent Warren a plea for reinforcements and water. Meanwhile, Coke never reached the summit. He saw Thorneycroft&#x27;s message for help but then did nothing to assure the lieutenant colonel of his nearby presence or support.

The Middlesex Regiment and the Imperial Light Infantry, under Colonel Augustus Hill, who was senior to Thorneycroft in the army list and who also believed he was overall commander on the kop, held the British right for two and a half hours until a second crisis occurred when they too began to give way. The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) arrived at this point, and drove the Boers back with a bayonet charge. The fighting on the British right now became a stalemate.

In the morning, Warren had asked for reinforcements from Lyttelton&#x27;s division, even though he had eleven battalions of his own to draw upon. Without asking Buller, Lyttelton sent two battalions toward Spion Kop. One battalion, the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, turned aside to attack Twin Peaks. After losing Lieutenant Colonel Riddell killed and 100 other casualties, the Rifles cracked the thin Boer line and carried the double summit at 17:00.

==Aftermath==

Shattered by the loss of Twin Peaks, General Schalk Willem Burger took his commando out of the battle line that night. On Spion Kop, the Boers who had fought bravely since morning abandoned their positions as darkness fell. They were about to retreat, when Botha appeared and persuaded them to stay. The Boers, however, did not reclaim their positions, and unknown to Thorneycroft, the battle was as good as won. But Thorneycroft&#x27;s nerve was also shattered. After sixteen hours on the kop doing the job of a brigadier-general in total absence of instructions from Warren, he ordered an unauthorised withdrawal from Spioen Kop after reporting that the soldiers had no water and ammunition was running short. His reasons for withdrawing were that without artillery support to counter the heavy Boer artillery fire, there was no possibility of defending the position and the extreme difficulty of digging trenches on the summit of Spion Kop left the British soldiers completely exposed. Churchill appeared on the scene for the second time. This time he brought the first orders from Warren since he elevated Thorneycroft to brigadier. Churchill said 1,400 men were on the way with two large naval guns. Thorneycroft told him, &quot;better six good battalions safely down the hill than a bloody mop-up in the morning.&quot; He ordered the brigade to retreat.

At the same time, Buller sent Lyttelton strict orders to recall his troops from Twin Peaks.

When morning came, the Boer generals were astonished to see two burghers on the top of Spion Kop, waving their slouch-hats in triumph. The only British on the kop were the dead and the dying.

The British suffered 243 fatalities during the battle; many were buried in the trenches where they fell. Approximately 1,250 British were either wounded or captured. Mohandas Gandhi was a stretcher-bearer at the battle, in the Indian Ambulance Corps he had organised, and was decorated. The Boers suffered 335 casualties of which 68 were dead, including Commandant Prinsloo&#x27;s commando casualties of 55 killed and wounded out of 88 men.

The British retreated back over the Tugela, but the Boers were too exhausted to pursue and follow up their success. Once across the river, Buller managed to rally his troops. Ladysmith would be relieved by the British four weeks later.

==Reaction and legacy==
The battle was the background for Louwrens Penning&#x27;s best known novel &quot;De held van Spionkop&quot; (1901, &quot;The Hero of Spionkop&quot;). Penning&#x27;s story concerns the very real Commandant Louis Wessels, who leads the Boer commando to defeat the British at the battle.

==Commentary==
Buller erred in appointing Warren an independent commander, despite his own doubts about his subordinate&#x27;s capacity. On the evening of the battle, Warren only ordered up reinforcements in men and heavy guns at the late hour of 21:00. Medical assistance, water and ammunition were also tardy in arriving.

&quot;Still, perhaps it was not Warren&#x27;s failure to remedy these deficiencies that proved his worst error. It was his failure to tell Thorneycroft of his plans to do so. Astonishing as it may seem, he had sent no direct instructions to Thorneycroft since the heliogram appointing him a general at midday. He had left it to Coke to reassure Thorneycroft, although (by another astonishing blunder) Warren had never actually told Coke that he had put Thorneycroft in charge. Then, to compound all these blunders, at 9:00 pm Warren had ordered Coke to return to the HQ for consultation, leaving Thorneycroft alone among the horrors on the summit.&quot;

== Note about the name ==
The common English name for the battle is &quot;Spion Kop&quot; throughout the Commonwealth and its historical literature, the official South African English and Afrikaans name for the battle is : means &#x27;spy&#x27; or &#x27;look-out&#x27;, and means &#x27;hill&#x27; or &#x27;outcropping&#x27;. Another variant that is sometimes found is the combination into &quot;Spioenkop&quot;.

The reason why the older spelling is used internationally is because the name &quot;Spioenkop&quot; originates from Dutch; [spee-yawn], and not [spee-yoon], is the Dutch word for &#x27;spy&#x27;. Until the 1920s, Dutch was still the official &quot;written&quot; language of the Boers, which is why the older Dutch spelling persists outside South Africa. Within South Africa, the spelling was updated along with Afrikaans spelling reform and recognition of Afrikaans as a language in its own right.

== Legacy of the name ==

* Many football grounds in England in the Premier League and Football League have one terrace or stand in their stadia named &quot;Kop&quot; or &quot;Spion Kop&quot; because of the steep nature of the terracing. For a history and list of these, &quot;see&quot; Spion Kop (stadiums).

<text>Ecgþēow (pronounced ), Edgetho (Proto-Norse *&quot;Agiþewaz&quot;), or Ecgtheow is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He is not mentioned outside the &quot;Bēowulf&quot; manuscript, and it is not known whether he was based on a real person. He belonged to a probably Swedish family (an &quot;ätt&quot;, see Norse clans) called the &quot;Waegmundings&quot;. He married the daughter of Hreðel, king of the Geats, and was the father of Bēowulf.

His name could be read as &quot;eċġ&quot; + &quot;þēow&quot;, &quot;edge-servant&quot; (that is, sword-thane); alternatively, if his name was a compound of the ancient &quot;bahuvrihi&quot; type as were many other Germanic heroic names, it would indicate proficiency with the sword, meaning literally, &quot;whose servant is the sword&quot;.

He is first mentioned in &quot;Bēowulf&quot; at lines 262–266, when Beowulf tells the coast-guard that &quot;My father was known to everyone,&quot; calls him a &quot;noble battle-leader&quot;, and says that he died after living through &quot;many winters&quot; and that he is remembered well by wise men everywhere.

At lines 372–375, Hrothgar, the Danish king, recalls Ecgtheow, remembering that he married King Hreðel&#x27;s only daughter.

At lines 456–472, Hrothgar recalls the story of how Ecgtheow once came to him for help: he had slain Heaðolaf, a man from another tribe called the &quot;Wulfings&quot; (probably the rulers of the East Geats). One of the Germanic ways of resolving a blood feud was either to pay a wergild (Anglo-Saxon, &quot;man-price&quot;) or to be banished. Either Ecgþēow&#x27;s people could not pay a wergild, or the Wulfings refused to accept it from them; so Ecgþeow had to leave home. He went to Dane-Land; Hrōðgār paid the wergild, and Ecgþeow swore oaths of friendship to him.

The Wulfings were probably the same as the Wylfings mentioned in &quot;Widsith&quot;, and according to &quot;Widsith&quot; one of their lords was Helm. Hroðgar married Wealhþeow, a Helming lady, who thus likely belonged to the Wulfings, and this may explain why Ecgþeow went to Dane-Land particularly. Hroðgar may have been able to use his family ties to persuade the Wulfings to accept the wergild and end the feud.

Hrothgar interprets Beowulf&#x27;s journey as a son&#x27;s gratitude for what Hrōðgār had done for Beowulf&#x27;s father.

At lines 2428–2429 we learn that the young Bēowulf was fostered and raised in the home of Hreðel starting when he was seven years old; Ecgþēow may have died by then, or the family may just have been following a custom.

At lines 2813–2815 we learn that the thane Wiglaf is a Waegmunding; therefore his father Weohstan was in some way related to Ecgþeow.

<doc id="988124" wikidata="Q7422719" url="?curid=988124" title="Sarah Purser">
<text>Sarah Henrietta Purser RHA (22 March 1848 – 7 August 1943) was an Irish artist mainly noted for her portraiture. She was the first woman to become a full member of the Royal Hibernian Academy. She also founded and financially supported An Túr Gloine, a stained glass studio.

==Biography ==

Purser was born in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in County Dublin, and raised in Dungarvan, County Waterford. She was one of the numerous children of Benjamin Purser, a prosperous flour miller and brewer, and his wife Anne Mallet. She was related to Sir Frederic W. Burton, who was a son of Hannah Mallet. The Purser family had come to Ireland from Gloucestershire in the eighteenth century. Two of her brothers, John and Louis, became professors at Trinity College Dublin. Her niece, Olive Purser, daughter of her brother Alfred, was the first woman scholar in TCD.

Until her death, Purser lived for many years in Mespil House, a Georgian mansion with beautiful plaster ceilings on Mespil Road, on the banks of the Grand Canal. Here she was &quot;at home&quot; every Tuesday afternoon to Dublin&#x27;s writers and artists; her afternoon parties were a fixture of Dublin literary life. Mespil House was demolished after she died and its footprint developed into apartments. She was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery beside her brothers John and Louis.

== Education ==
At thirteen, she attended the Moravian school, Institution Evangélique de Montmirail, Switzerland, where she learnt to speak fluent French and began painting. In 1873, her father&#x27;s business failed and she decided to become a full-time painter. She attended classes at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. She joined the Dublin Sketching Club, where she was later appointed an honorary member. In 1874, she distinguished herself in the National Competition. In 1878, she again contributed to the RHA, and for the next fifty years became a regular exhibitor, mainly portraits, and showed an average of three works per show.

From 1878 to 1879, she studied at the Académie Julian in Paris where she met the German painter Louise Catherine Breslau, with whom she became a lifelong friend.

== Career ==
Sarah Purser became wealthy through astute investments, particularly in Guinness, for which several of her male relatives had worked over the years. She was very active in the art world in Dublin and was involved in the setting up of the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, persuading the Irish government to provide Charlemont House in Parnell Square to house the gallery.

She had a studio at 11 Harcourt Terrace where she lived from 1887 to 1909.

She was the second woman to sit on the Board of Governors and Guardians, National Gallery of Ireland, 1914–1943.

She was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1890; the first female Associate Member in 1923 and the first female Member in 1924. In 1924, she initiated the movement for the launching of the Friends of the National Collection of Ireland.

==Portraiture==

She worked mostly as a portraitist. Through her talent and energy, and owing to her friendship with the Gore-Booths, she was very successful in obtaining commissions, famously commenting
:&quot;I went through the British aristocracy like the measles.&quot;
When the Viceroy of Ireland commissioned her to portray his children in 1888 his choice reflected her position as the country&#x27;s foremost portraitist.

In 1977, Bruce Arnold noted
:&quot;some of her finest and most sensitive work was not strictly portraiture, for example, &quot;An Irish Idyll&quot; in the Ulster Museum, and &quot;Le Petit Déjeuner&quot; (in the National Gallery of Ireland).&quot;

== Glass (An Túr Gloine) ==

Sarah Purser financed &quot;An Túr Gloine&quot; (The Tower of Glass), a stained glass cooperative, at 24 Upper Pembroke and ran it from its inauguration in 1903 until her retirement in 1940. Michael Healy was the first of a number of distinguished recruits, such as Catherine O&#x27;Brien, Evie Hone, Wilhelmina Geddes, Beatrice Elvery, Ethel Rhind, or the Belgian painter Marthe Donas. Purser was determined the stained glass workshop should adhere to true Arts and Crafts philosophy: &#x27;Each window is the work of one artist who makes the sketch and cartoon and selects and paints every morsel of glass him or herself&#x27;.

Purser did not produce many items of stained glass herself. Most of the stained glass works were painted by other members of the cooperative, presumably under her direction. Two early works, 1904, were &quot;St. Ita&quot; for St. Brendan&#x27;s Cathedral, Loughrea and &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; for St. Columba&#x27;s College, Dublin. Her last stained glass work is thought to be &quot;The Good Shepherd and the Good Samaritan&quot;, 1926, for the Church of Ireland at Killucan, County Westmeath.

==Legacy==

Purser is commemorated by a plaque on Harcourt Terrace. An Post issued a commemorative stamp for her as part of a series on &quot;Pioneering Women&quot; in 2020.

Various portraits painted by Purser are held in the National Gallery of Ireland, the Ulster Museum and in Hugh Lane Gallery.

Archives relating to Sarah Purser are housed in the Centre for the Study of Irish Art, National Gallery of Ireland and in the National Library of Ireland. An Túr Gloine archive is held in the Centre for the Study of Irish Art, National Gallery of Ireland.

An exhibition of Purser&#x27;s work was held at Dublin&#x27;s Municipal Gallery of Modern Art (now Hugh Lane Gallery) in 1974 to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the FNCI. The National Gallery of Ireland mounted ‘Sarah Purser: Private Worlds’ in 2023-4 and Hugh Lane Gallery exhibited ‘More Power to You: Sarah Purser – A Force for Irish Art’ from 10 July 2024 to 5 January 2025.

<text>Chipinge District is a district in Manicaland Province of eastern Zimbabwe. The administrative headquarters is Chipinge.

==Geography==

Chipinge District is the southernmost district in Manicaland province. It is bounded on the north by Chimanimani District, on the west by Masvingo Province, and on the east by Mozambique.

The Save River forms the western boundary of the District, and drains the western and southern portions of district. The northeastern portion of the district is drained by the Buzi River and its headwater tributaries.

The southern end of the Eastern Highlands reach into the northern portion of the district. Mount Selinda (1,230 meters) lies near the Mozambican border.

===Townships and villages===
* Craigmore
* Chibuwe
* Chipinge
* Chisumbanje
* Checheche
* Junction Gate
* Mkasa
* Rupisi

==People==
The rural portion of Chipinge District has a population of 324,133. The rural population is 298,841, and the urban population, which consists of Chipinge town, is 25,292 (2012 census).

Ndau people, a sub group of the Shona people, inhabit the north and central portions of the district. Tswa people live in the south.

==Transport==
The A10 road runs through the district, running southwards from Chimanimani District, then jogging west to the Save River. Here it meets the A16 road, which runs south along the Save from Birchenough Bridge. From the A16 junction the A10 follows the Save southwards, crossing westwards over the Save River at Rupangwana via the Jack Quinton Bridge.

Where the A10 turns west, a road branches south to Chipinge, and continues southeast to cross the Mozambican border between Mount Selinda and Espungabera in Mozambique.

Chipinge Airport is near the town of Chipinge.

==Administration==
The District has 31 rural administrative wards, and eight urban wards in Chipinge town.

The district is divided into five Assembly parliamentary constituencies: Chipinge Central, Chipinge East, Chipinge South, Chipinge West, and Musikavanhu. The district is a single Senate constituency.

==Ecology==
Miombo woodland is the predominant vegetation in the northern, central, and northeastern portions of the district.

Mopane woodland occurs in the Save River lowlands in the west and south of the district.

Pockets of mid-elevation evergreen forest occur on a few eastward-facing mountain slopes in the district, where the mountains create orographic precipitation from winds coming from the Indian Ocean.

===Protected areas===
Chipinge Safari Area (261 km2) is located in the highlands west of Chipinge, overlooking the Save River Valley. It includes both miombo and mopane woodland.

Chirinda Forest Botanical Reserve protects an enclave of evergreen forest on the slopes of Mount Selinda.

<text>Tokaj () is a historical town in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, Northern Hungary, 54 kilometers from county capital Miskolc. It is the centre of the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district where Tokaji wine is produced.

== History ==
The wine-growing area was first mentioned by the name Tokaj in 1067. The town itself was first mentioned in documents in 1353. Its first castle was a motte, which was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. By the 14th century, the town already had a stone castle, belonging to the Diósgyőr estate.

After 1450, Tokaj was the property of the Hunyadi family, so after Matthias Hunyadi became king, the town became a royal estate. In 1526, after the Ottomans captured Petervarad (modern day Petrovaradin, Serbia), Cistercians from Petervarad and its surroundings relocated to Tokaj and greatly improved wine making in the area. In 1705, Francis II Rákóczi ordered the castle to be destroyed.

After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the town prospered, but when the World Wars came, it suffered greatly, losing its importance and town status. Even its role in wine trade was taken over by Sátoraljaújhely.

Tokaj was granted town status again in 1986 and it again started to prosper. Now, the town is a popular tourist attraction.

== Tokaj wine region ==

Tokaj wine region is a historical wine region located in northeastern Hungary and southeastern Slovakia. It is one of the seven larger wine regions of Hungary (Hungarian: Tokaji borrégió). Hegyalja means &quot;foothills&quot; in Hungarian, and this was the original name of the region.

The region consists of 28 named villages and 11,149 hectares of classified vineyards, of which an estimated 5,500 are currently planted. Tokaj has been declared a World Heritage Site in 2002 under the name Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape. However, its fame long predated this distinction because it is the origin of Tokaji aszú wine, the world&#x27;s oldest botrytized wine.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Tokaj is twinned with:

* Binyamina-Giv&#x27;at Ada, Israel
* Cormons, Italy
* Dej, Romania

<text>The Alexiad () is a medieval historical and biographical text written around the year 1148, by the Byzantine princess Anna Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. It was written in a form of artificial Attic Greek. Anna described the political and military history of the Byzantine Empire during the reign of her father, thus providing a significant account on the Byzantium of the High Middle Ages. Among other topics, the &quot;Alexiad&quot; documents the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s interaction with the Crusades and highlights the conflicting perceptions of the East and West in the early 12th century. It does not mention the schism of 1054 – a topic which is very common in contemporary writing. It documents firsthand the decline of Byzantine cultural influence in eastern and western Europe, particularly in the West&#x27;s increasing involvement in its geographic sphere. The &quot;Alexiad&quot; was paraphrased in vernacular medieval Greek in mid-14th century to increase its readability, which testifies to the work&#x27;s lasting interest.

==Structure==

The book is divided into 15 books and a prologue. Its scope is limited to the duration of Alexios&#x27; reign, which it is thus able to depict in full detail, especially regarding political relations between the Byzantine Empire and western European powers.

1. Attacks against the Byzantine empire by the Normans, under their leader Robert Guiscard (Books 1–6):

:Book 1 addresses Alexios&#x27; becoming general and Domestikos ton Scholon. It also discusses the Normans&#x27; preparation for their invasion. Book 2 addresses the Komnenian revolt. Book 3 addresses Alexios as Emperor (1081), the internal problems with Doukas family, and the Normans&#x27; crossing the Adriatic Sea. Book 4 addresses war against the Normans (1081–1082). Book 5 also addresses war against the Normans (1082–1083) and their first clash with the &quot;heretics&quot;. Book 6 addresses the end of war against the Normans (1085) and the death of Robert Guiscard.

2. Byzantine relations with the Turks (Books 6–7, 9–10, and 14–15):

:Book 7 addresses war against the Scythians (1087–1090). Book 9 addresses operations against Tzachas and the Dalmatians (1092–1094) and the conspiracy of Nicephorus Diogenes (1094). Book 10 addresses war against the Cumans and the beginning of the First Crusade (1094–1097). Book 14 addresses Turks, Franks, Cumans and Manicheans (1108–1115). Book 15 addresses the last expeditions — The Bogomils — Death of Alexios (1116–1118).

3. Pecheneg incursions on the northern Byzantine frontier (Books 7–8)

:Book 8 addresses the end of the Scythian war (1091) and plots against the Emperor.

4. The First Crusade and Byzantine reactions to it (Books 10–11)

:Book 11 also addresses the First Crusade (1097–1104).

5. Attacks on Byzantine frontiers by Robert Guiscard&#x27;s son, Bohemond I of Antioch (Books 11–13)

:Book 12 addresses domestic conflicts and the Norman preparation for their second invasion (1105–1107). Book 13 addresses Aaron&#x27;s conspiracy and the second Norman invasion (1107–1108).

==Themes==
The main theme of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; is the First Crusade and religious conflict. Anna Komnene chronicles the different groups of people involved in the crusades, and refers to them as &quot;Celts&quot;, &quot;Latins&quot;, and &quot;Normans&quot;. She also talks about her father, Alexios Komnenos in great detail and his conquests throughout his rule from 1081 to 1118. She does this by presenting a &quot;Byzantine view&quot; of the Crusades. Some historians have noticed the influence of Greek mythology in her work, as stated by Lenora Neville, &quot;the characterization of Alexios as wily sea captain steering the empire through constant storms with guile and courage strongly recalls Odysseus&quot;.

==Narrative style==
The &quot;Alexiad&quot; was written in Greek in around 1148 and first edited by Possinus in 1651. Anna Komnene described herself in the text and openly acknowledges her feelings and opinions for some events, which goes against the typical format of historiography. She differed widely from Greek prose historians and because of this the book was initially well received; it was subjected to criticism later. The &quot;Alexiad&quot; interests many historians because Anna wrote it in a different format to the norm of the time. Anna Komnene is the only female Greek historiographer of her era and historians are keen to believe that her style of writing owes much to her being a woman. Despite including herself in the historiography and the other qualities that make her style vastly different from the typical historiography of the era, Anna Komnene&#x27;s &quot;Alexiad&quot; has been seen as a &quot;straightforward&quot; history.

==Influences==
Anna Komnene&#x27;s writings are a major source of information on her father, Alexios I of the Byzantine Empire. She was around the age of 55 when she began work on the &quot;Alexiad&quot;. She held the crusaders that came to her father&#x27;s aid in contempt for their actions against the Empire after they looted various conquests and failed to return to the Basileus&#x27; demesne many of the lands they promised to return to him. She regarded the crusaders, whom she refers to as Celts, Latins and Normans, as uneducated barbarians. Despite this, Anna claims that she portrayed them in a neutral light. Some historians believe her work to be biased because of her feelings towards the Crusaders and how highly she regarded her father.

=== Bias ===
In her introduction, Anna Komnene stated her intention to record true events and to give an account of her father&#x27;s deeds which &quot;do not deserve to be consigned to forgetfulness&quot;. She is aware that in writing her father&#x27;s history she may be accused of using panegyric language and often tries to remind the reader of her integrity as an impartial reporter of past events. Emphasis on Alexios as a &quot;specifically Christian emperor&quot;, and a moral as well as politically laudable one, is pervasive. Frankopan compares Alexios&#x27; treatment in the text to the techniques of the hagiographical tradition, while contrasting it with the negative portrait of or the absence of, his successors John II and Manuel I. Anna discussed the Latins (Normans and &quot;Franks&quot;), whom she described as barbarians. This distaste extends to the Turks and Armenians. The &quot;Alexiad&quot; also criticized John II Komnenos for his accession to the throne (in place of Anna herself) following Alexios&#x27; death. From a modern reader&#x27;s point of view, the inconsistencies in the descriptions of military events and the Empire&#x27;s misfortunes (partially due to these literary and especially Homeric influences) may seem exaggerated and stereotypical. Despite these issues, George Ostrogorsky emphasizes the importance of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; as a primary document.

==Gender and authorship==
===Questions of authorship===
There has been some debate as to whether the &quot;Alexiad&quot; was in fact written by Anna Komnene. One scholar stated that the text gives very few comments that would suggest the author&#x27;s gender or any other aspect of their background, aside from a few explicit mentions. This has led some scholars to argue that the &quot;Alexiad&quot; was not written by a woman. This belief, put forward by Howard-Johnston, focuses mainly on the military sections of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; and suggests that Anna was merely working from her husband&#x27;s field notes, thus Howard-Johnston renames it &quot;Nicephoros&#x27;s &quot;Alexiad&quot;&quot;.

It is largely agreed that Anna Komnene was the author. The predominance of military matters is argued to match Anna&#x27;s choice to write history in the epic genre, reflecting the cultural influence of her family. Mentions in the text of her engagement, her role as a wife and the commentary on her female modesty that influences her writing make Anna&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; &quot;unmistakable&quot;, according to some scholars. She certainly could have written about military affairs, since she was able to accompany her father, the emperor, on military campaigns. She names her sources explicitly as &quot;those who accompanied the emperor on campaign&quot;, as well as Alexios Komnenos and George Palaiologos, so that &quot;[i]t is not necessary to imagine that she left out a reference to her most important source&quot;. Many scholars believe that the great detail about her father&#x27;s home life and military style, combined with her experiences and mentions of femininity, provide a strong case for her authorship of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;.

===Representations of gender===
Women of the aristocracy had more opportunities to pursue higher education, in comparison to those of humble origins, whose education was mainly learning to write and read, memorizing psalms and studying the scriptures. Some female aristocrats had an interest in literature and would be praised for their depth of knowledge by contemporary writers. Despite that, Komnene&#x27;s high education and expertise in secular literature – the study of which was typically discouraged – remained exceptional.

In the &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna Komnene portrays gender and gender stereotypes in an unusual way. Like her male counterparts, she characterizes women along the typical stereotypes, such as being &quot;liable to tears and as cowardly in the face of danger&quot;. Despite this, women in the &quot;Alexiad&quot; never cry, with the exception of Alexios&#x27; funeral, during which grief is the appropriate cultural response. None of the female characters act in a cowardly way. She points to her own gender in a similar way when mentioning her own tears while writing certain events. Immediately she informs the reader that she will stop crying properly to return to her duty of history, an episode which she repeats twice in the narrative. She shows a desire to control aspects that are, for her culture, feminine. Anna concerns herself primarily with intellect, which she attributes to men and women. Her attitudes, along with the lack of comparable sources from female authors in that era, make the &quot;Alexiad&quot; considered by some a poor source to use when gauging how average women in Byzantium felt about the First Crusade.

===Gender and style===
Anna Komnene&#x27;s unusual style of writing history has been attributed to her gender. Her style is noteworthy in that it included a history of her father&#x27;s actions during the First Crusade and her reactions to some of these events. Her opinions and commentary on particular events in an otherwise historical text have been assigned to her gender both positively and negatively. This interpretation of her histories is known as a &quot;gendered history&quot;, meaning it is the history of Alexios and of Anna through her style, which is not seen in male authors. While the Roman historian Edward Gibbon saw this &quot;gendered&quot; narrative to betray &quot;in every page the vanity of a female author&quot;, with some scholars agreeing with him, other scholars claim that this style might be indicative of Anna&#x27;s mentor, Michael Psellos. Some take this even further to suggest that Anna used Psellos&#x27; &quot;Chronographia&quot; as a model for her narration in her history and took his style even further, suggesting it was not her gender but her influences that led to her writing style.

Anna Komnene is considered unique for her time in the intensity by which she integrates her own narrative and emotion and yet she does not mention all personal details, such as having four children. For some, this combination of style and lack of personal, gendered information is reconciled by her lack of modern feminist ideals, without which she was not interested in questioning her societal place in her narrative, even though her depictions of women do not fit in with the majority of male authors of the time. Her style can be understood from her belief that intelligence and nobility are far greater than gender in terms of importance and so Anna does not view her history as overstepping any necessary gender roles.

<text>Wimbledon is a 2004 sports romantic comedy film directed by Richard Loncraine. The film stars Paul Bettany as a journeyman tennis pro (once ranked 11th) and Kirsten Dunst as an up-and-coming tennis star. Sam Neill and Jon Favreau co-star.

==Plot==
Peter Colt, a British professional tennis player in his thirties whose ranking has slipped from 11th to 119th in the world, has never really had to fight for anything, as his wealthy family allowed him to easily pursue his tennis ambitions. Though he earns a wildcard spot to the Wimbledon tournament, he feels it&#x27;s time to admit he&#x27;s getting too old to compete with fitter up-and-coming younger players and intends, after this last Wimbledon, to take a job with a prestigious tennis club.

As Wimbledon begins, he bumps into the American, Lizzie Bradbury, the rising star of women&#x27;s tennis. They fall in love and her interest in him changes his entire perception, even giving him the strength to win again. After an unexpected win in the first round, Peter is about to lose his second match but turns it around when he hears Lizzie cheering for him in the crowd. In his third match, he unexpectedly comes up against his training partner and best friend, Dieter Prohl. Peter beats Dieter, who comments that Peter has developed a &#x27;killer instinct&#x27;, the ability to win the match no matter the cost or the method. Peter&#x27;s unexpected success makes him a sensation in Britain, as many place their hopes on either him or his next competitor, Tom Cavendish, to deliver a British win at Wimbledon. Peter and Lizzie&#x27;s relationship progresses, despite the disapproval of Lizzie&#x27;s overprotective father-manager Dennis Bradbury, who believes it detrimental to her career. 

At a reception for the Wimbledon players at the London Eye, Lizzie is approached by an apparent old flame, arrogant American star and world number 1 Jake Hammond. Hammond deduces that Peter and Lizzie are seeing each other when Peter defends her. When Hammond insults Lizzie, Peter punches him and the couple run away to Peter&#x27;s flat in Brighton. The next day, Dennis comes to Peter&#x27;s flat and yells at him for spoiling his daughter&#x27;s game. Lizzie overhears this and decides to leave him and focus on her game. The next day, Peter faces off against Tom Cavendish and beats him when Cavendish sprains his ankle, demonstrating his ability to go all the way.

The night before their semifinal matches, Peter sneaks into Lizzie&#x27;s hotel room and persuades her to have sex. The next day, he performs above expectations and wins in straight sets, but Lizzie loses. Lizzie angrily breaks up with Peter, claiming his selfishness made her lose and decides to immediately return to the United States to train.

Peter has to play the final match against Jake Hammond. At the airport, Lizzie watches an interview on TV in which Peter apologizes and declares his love for her. She returns to Wimbledon.

As Lizzie reaches the stadium, Peter has lost two sets in the final and is behind in the third. When the game is suspended due to rain, Lizzie appears in the dressing room and forgives him. She tells him the secret of Jake&#x27;s tricky serves and Peter fights back to win the title (3–6, 2–6, 6–4, 7–6(8-6), 6–4). Now a national hero in Britain, he and Lizzie get married. With his support, Lizzie goes on to win the U.S. Open and Wimbledon twice, ultimately achieving her dreams. In the last scene, Peter is with their younger child, a boy, watching Lizzie and their elder child, a girl, playing tennis on a neighbourhood court in New York City.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film is dedicated to Mark McCormack, founder of International Management Group, a management firm for high-level athletes, who died on 16 May 2003.

===Casting===
The film used locally recruited Wimbledon residents as extras for the crowd scenes.

Kirsten Dunst was interviewed about the film. She was under contract with Harvey Weinstein at Miramax and to complete the contract, she agreed to do the film, provided she could select her costar. She selected Paul Bettany.

===Filming===
The actors served with real tennis balls. All others were added digitally to make it appear like they were playing.

===Locations===

Some scenes were filmed during the 2003 Championships between matches. It is the only time in the history of the tournament that this has been allowed. Some court scenes with Bettany were filmed at the Stoke Park Country Club, home of The Boodles Challenge. London Zoo&#x27;s entrance was used for the entrance to Wimbledon. The beachfront scenes were filmed on location in Brighton.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Wimbledon&quot; received mixed reviews, holding a score of 61% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 146 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10. The consensus reads, &quot;A predictable, bland rom-com, but Bettany proves to be an appealing lead.&quot; It received &quot;average&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot; reviews from Metacritic, a 59 out of 100 based on reviews by 35 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Wimbledon&quot; was &quot;much more conventional&quot; than Loncraine&#x27;s previous films but with &quot;cleverer-than-average dialogue and sharply drawn subsidiary characters&quot;. Michael Charlotte&#x27;s review for &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five stars, saying, &quot;In tennis parlance, this fires off more moonballs to stay in play than outright winning shots. But Bettany is charming, and thankfully he and Dunst are appealing together&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review: &quot;&quot;Wimbledon&quot; is a well-behaved movie about nice people who have good things happen to them. That&#x27;s kind of startling, in a world where movie characters, especially in sports movies, occupy the edge of human experience. What a surprise to hear conversation instead of dialogue, and to realize that the villain may actually be right some of the time&quot;. He gave the film three out of four stars.

===Box office===
The film opened at number four, grossing US$7.1 million in its opening weekend at the North American box office.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s digital soundtrack uses the &quot;Surround EX&quot; format. The song that plays in the trailer of the film is &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; by U2. The film features two songs by the Sugababes: &quot;Caught in a Moment&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot;, both from the album &quot;Three&quot;.

<text>Military discipline is the obedience to a code of conduct while in military service.

According to the U.S. Army Field Manual 7-21.13 4-4:
Discipline in the Army is one of the most basic elements of warfighting. Its purpose is to train you so you can execute orders quickly and intelligently under the most difficult conditions. Insistence on performing tasks properly enhances military discipline. For example, it means ensuring you wear your uniform properly, march well or repeating tasks until you perform them correctly. (...) Discipline in routine conduct such as saluting, police call, and physical training, can make discipline much easier to achieve when responding to more difficult conduct such as advancing under fire, refusing an illegal order, or moving a wounded Soldier to safety.

<doc id="988159" wikidata="Q3280729" url="?curid=988159" title="The Freedom Sessions">
<text>The Freedom Sessions is an album by Sarah McLachlan which was released on 6 December 1994 on Nettwerk in Canada and on 28 March 1995 on Arista Records in the United States. The album contains previously unreleased alternative versions and remixes of seven songs that had appeared on McLachlan&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, as well as a cover version of &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot; by Tom Waits. Many of the tracks were recorded during the same sessions as &quot;Fumbling&quot;. In subsequent live performances, some of these songs (most notably &quot;Ice Cream&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot;) were reworked to match the style in which they were played on this album.

The album was released in two versions: a standard CD, and an enhanced CD containing CD-ROM bonus material including interviews and music videos. The album was one of the first major enhanced CD releases, and sold more than 200,000 units. As &quot;Toronto Star&quot; writer Peter Howell describes, &quot;The Freedom Sessions&quot; has &quot;the distinction of being the first CD-ROM disc ever to chart on the influential &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart&quot;.

<doc id="988167" wikidata="Q70767" url="?curid=988167" title="Ernst Niekisch">
<text>Ernst Niekisch (23 May 1889 – 23 May 1967) was a German writer and politician. Initially a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and of the Alte Sozialdemokratische Partei (ASP), he later became a prominent exponent of the National revolutionary branch of the Conservative Revolution and National Bolshevism.

==Early life==
Born in Trebnitz (Silesia), and brought up in Nördlingen. After studying at a teaching seminar, and completing a one-year voluntary military service with the Bavarian Army, he was appointed a public school teacher in Augsburg. From 1914 to 1917, he served with the Imperial German Army during WWI.

He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1917, returned to Augsburg as a teacher. and was instrumental in the setting up of a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Indeed, for a time at the start of the year, after the resignation of Kurt Eisner and immediately before the establishment of the Bavarian Soviet Republic, Niekisch wielded effective power as chairman of the central executive of Bavarian councils, an interim governing body. He left the SPD soon afterward and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) for a time before he returned to his former party. He served a brief spell in prison in 1925 for his part in the abortive Bavarian coup.

==Nationalism==
In the 1920s, he stressed the importance of nationalism and attempted to turn the SPD in that direction. He was so vehemently opposed to the Dawes Plan, the Locarno Treaties and the general pacifism of the SPD that he was expelled from the party in 1926.

Upon his expulsion, Niekisch joined the Old Social Democratic Party of Saxony, which he influenced to his own nationalist form of socialism. He launched his own journal, &quot;Widerstand&quot; (Resistance), and he and his followers adopted the name of &quot;National Bolsheviks&quot; and looked to the Soviet Union as a continuation of both Russian nationalism and the old state of Prussia. The movement took the slogan of &quot;Sparta-Potsdam-Moscow&quot;. He was a member of ARPLAN (Association for the Study of Russian Planned Economy) with Ernst Jünger, Georg Lukács, Karl Wittfogel and Friedrich Hielscher, under whose auspices he visited the Soviet Union in 1932. He reacted favourably to Jünger&#x27;s publication &quot;Der Arbeiter&quot;, which he saw as a blueprint for a National Bolshevik Germany. He also believed in the necessity of a German-Soviet alliance against the &quot;decadent West&quot; and the Treaty of Versailles. The attempt to combine ultranationalism and communism, two extreme ends of the political spectrum, caused Niekisch&#x27;s National Bolsheviks to be a force with little support.

==Third Reich==
Although anti-Jewish and in favour of a totalitarian state, Niekisch rejected Adolf Hitler, who he felt lacked any real socialism, and Niekisch instead looked to Joseph Stalin and the industrial development of the Soviet Union as his model for the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;. Writing in 1958, Niekisch condemned Hitler as a power-obsessed demagogue who was an enemy of the elitist spirit that Niekisch advocated. He was particularly ill-disposed towards Joseph Goebbels and, at a meeting between the two facilitated by their mutual friend, Arnolt Bronnen, Niekisch and Goebbels had almost come to blows. Bronnen would break from Niekisch in 1932 after the latter published the pamphlet &quot;Hitler – ein deutsches Verhängnis&quot;, with Bronnen considering the attack on Nazism a personal insult. In the immediate aftermath of the Reichstag fire, his house was searched for evidence of any involvement, but that was not pursued. He also discussed his opposition to the new regime with Ulrich von Hassell although Niekisch did not join the German Resistance.

Despite his criticisms of Nazism, he was allowed to continue editing &quot;Widerstand&quot; until the paper was banned in December 1934. He was allowed to visit Rome in 1935 and held meetings with Benito Mussolini, who told Niekisch that he considered Hitler&#x27;s aggressive stances towards the Soviet Union to be foolish and would later discuss opposition groups with the Italian Consul General while Italo-German relations were somewhat strained.

In 1937, Niekisch and dozens of his colleagues were arrested by the Gestapo for writing articles against the regime. In 1939, Niekisch was found guilty of &#x27;literary high treason by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof,&quot; along with fellow National Bolsheviks Joseph Drexel and Karl Tröger, and sentenced to life in prison. Following the intervention of his former ally, Jünger, his family could retain his property, but not secure his release. Niekisch remained in prison until April 1945, when he was liberated by the Red Army. By then, he had nearly gone blind.

==Later life==
Embittered against nationalism by his wartime experiences, he turned to orthodox Marxism and lectured in sociology in Humboldt University in East Germany until 1953 when, disillusioned by the brutal suppression of the workers&#x27; uprising, he relocated to West Berlin, where he died in 1967.

==Legacy==
Subsequent to his death, Niekisch was one of a number of writers, including the likes of Oswald Spengler, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Vilfredo Pareto and Carl Schmitt, whose works were promulgated by the likes of the &quot;Groupement de recherche et d&#x27;études pour la civilisation européenne&quot; and others involved in the Conservative Revolutionary movement.

<text>The British Rail Class 156 &quot;Super Sprinter&quot; is a diesel-hydraulic multiple unit passenger train. A total of 114 sets were built between 1987 and 1989 for British Rail by Metro-Cammell&#x27;s Washwood Heath works. They were built to replace elderly first-generation DMUs and locomotive-hauled passenger trains.

==Background==
By the beginning of the 1980s, British Rail (BR) operated a large fleet of first generation DMUs, which had been constructed in prior decades to various designs. While formulating its long-term strategy for this sector of its operations, British Rail planners recognised that there would be considerable costs incurred by undertaking refurbishment programmes necessary for the continued use of these ageing multiple units. Planners instead examined the prospects for the development and introduction of a new generation of DMUs to succeed the first generation.

The initial specification was relatively ambitious, calling for a maximum speed of and acceleration comparable to contemporary EMUs. This specification led to the experimental British Rail Class 210 DMU. However, it was found to be expensive, and it was recognised that a production model assembled from proven components would possess greater reliability and lower maintenance costs; an availability rate of 85 percent was forecast.

By 1983, experiences with the Class 210 had influenced BR planners to favour procuring a new generation of DMUs, but to also adopt a new specification that were somewhat less demanding than before. Specifically, it was decided to drop the top speed from , as testing had revealed the higher rate to deliver no perceivable improvement in journey times due to the typically short spacing of the stations the type was intended to serve. The requests for compatibility with other rolling stock were eliminated, although auto-coupling and auto-connecting functionality was added. In addition to a good ride quality, the specification included a sound level of 90 dB when at full speed, an operational range of , and an interval between major overhauls of five years or .

The bid submitted by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was heavily based on its successful Class 455 EMU, sharing its body and the majority of its running gear, albeit equipped with two different power trains.

The resulting Class 150 was viewed as unsatisfactory for more-upmarket services. Studies showed coaches could be stretched, providing more internal volume and thus enabling the somewhat cramped two-by-three seating arrangement of the Class 150 to be substituted with a more roomy two-by-two counterpart. These changes could be implemented without impacting much of the benefits of adopting the existing design.

It was identified that this would result in a weight increase and thus a decreased power-to-weight ratio, but it was determined that the performance of the proposed DMU was only slightly lower, and it could achieve similar journey times across the intended cross-country routes as the Class 150. It was also found that, while there was a slight increase in fuel consumption due to the changes, the envisioned DMU had lower fuel consumption than locomotive-hauled trains and lower maintenance costs. Accordingly, it was decided to proceed with developing a detailed specification and issuing it to industry. Amongst the requirements listed in the issued specification was the explicit statement of the acceptability of the proven power trains of both the Class 150 and Class 151.

==Description==
The design of the Class 156 was relatively conservative in comparison to Metro-Cammell&#x27;s earlier Class 151 design. Specific changes include the bodyshell being primarily composed of steel instead of aluminium; the deliberate decision was made to model the cab design on the earlier Class 150 was allegedly taken to ease union acceptance. Each coach is powered, being outfitted with a single six-cylinder Cummins NT855-R5 diesel engine coupled to a Voith T211r hydraulic transmission and Gmeinder final drive units. The Class 156 can achieve a top speed of . Construction of the welded bodyshells was subcontracted out; 118 by Procor Engineering of Wakefield, 60 by W.H. Davis of Mansfield, and 50 by Standard Wagon of Heywood. Aston Martin Tickford were awarded the interior fitout contract. 

The units were numbered 156401 to 156514. Each unit was formed of two powered vehicles, one of which contained a toilet. Individual vehicle are numbered as follows, where the final three digits of the vehicle number match the unit to which the vehicle belongs:
* 52401–52514: Driving Motor Standard Lavatory (DMSL)
* 57401–57514: Driving Motor Standard (DMS), containing an area for storing wheelchairs, bicycles, bulky luggage etc.

Unlike the Class 150 units, the 156s have a single-leaf sliding door at either end of each coach. This reflected the expected longer journeys with fewer stops that the Class 156 was supposed to operate. As with the Class 150, all the doors are operable by passengers when released by the guard using one of two passenger door control panels; they are energised using a carriage key to turn a rotary switch situated on the cab bulkhead. Units operated by Abellio ScotRail have additionally been fitted with door-control panels near the centre sets of doors for the convenience of the guard.

Nine units used by Greater Anglia were transferred to East Midlands Railway in 2019, at which point they were renumbered into the 156/9 subclass (156419 becoming 156919, and so on) to indicate that their public address and passenger information systems were incompatible with EMR&#x27;s existing Class 156 units. A number of these units started to transfer to Northern Trains from December 2021 onwards, at which point they were returned to their original numbers.

==Operations==
===British Rail===

On 10 November 1987, 156401 conducted its first test run from Washwood Heath to Banbury. Between January and July 1988, 156401-156429 were delivered to Crown Point TMD entering service on 16 May 1988 on new services from East Anglia to North West England as well as existing services from Norwich and Cambridge to Birmingham. They also operated boat trains from Harwich to Blackpool and later Liverpool.

The remaining 85 were delivered to Heaton, Neville Hill, Haymarket and Inverness. With the Class 155 units withdrawn due to faulty door mechanisms, 25 were transferred to Cardiff from December 1988, with the last remaining until November 1989. In this guise they operated services as far south as Portsmouth. In May 1991, six were transferred from Crown Point to Derby Etches Park.

On 15 June 1989, 156502 was sent to the Netherlands as part of the Dutch Railways 150th anniversary celebrations. It returned on 10 July. On 21 October 1993, 156405 became the first Sprinter to accrue 1 million miles, whilst working the 10:10 Great Yarmouth to Norwich service.
The first 100 were painted in Provincial sector&#x27;s livery of blue and beige with light blue stripe. Twenty units based at Tyseley depot, 156401–156419 and 156422, were later repainted into Regional Railways &quot;Express&quot; livery after the rebranding of Provincial. The last fourteen units were operated by Strathclyde PTE, and carried an orange and black livery. Following the delivery of the Class 158s in the early 1990s, the 156s began to be cascaded to less important services.

In the early 1990s, British Rail was looking to save costs on rural routes, and decided that operating two-car trains was too expensive. The company planned to convert a number of Class 156 units into single-car vehicles, named as Class 152. In the event, the decision was taken to do this with the instead, forming the fleet.

===Post-privatisation===
As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the Class 156 fleet was split and sold to Angel Trains (76 units) and Porterbrook (38), who then leased the units to a number of train operating companies.

====Scotland====
At privatisation the Scottish fleet passed to the National Express owned ScotRail franchise, which used them until 2004 when the franchise was taken over by First ScotRail. All passed to Abellio ScotRail with the franchise in 2015.

Units 156500–156514 were operated by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and originally wore its orange and black livery. This was replaced with a carmine and cream livery in 1997, which was also applied to further 14 units. Despite receiving these special liveries, the SPT units were not confined to any specific route and thus worked in tandem with the rest of the Class 156 fleet on other routes. 

In September 2008, Transport Scotland announced that all ScotRail trains (including those of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport) would be repainted in a new livery of blue with white saltire markings on the carriage ends. The first unit was repainted in this livery by RailCare Springburn in February 2009.

In December 2014, unit 156478 was written off by Angel Trains and sold to Brodie Leasing after being damaged by floodwaters on the Glasgow South Western Line. Brodie Leasing repaired the unit and it returned to service with Abellio ScotRail in October 2016.

Between 2016 and 2019, all of ScotRail&#x27;s Class 156 units were refurbished to make them compliant with PRM-TSI standard. This refurbishment included a larger toilet, a dedicated wheelchair area and brand new interior upholstery with new seats similar to those found on the Class 385.

In late 2018, five units transferred to Arriva Rail North after the Class 385s began to enter service.

From 2020, ScotRail’s Class 156 units began operating in multiple with Class 153 units on the West Highland Line to provide upgraded seating and additional capacity for bicycles and other sporting equipment.

The ScotRail 156s currently operate the following routes:

*Glasgow Central to East Kilbride
*Glasgow Central to Kilmarnock/Carlisle
*Glasgow Central/Ayr to Girvan/Stranraer
*Glasgow Queen Street to Anniesland
*Glasgow Queen Street to Mallaig/Oban

Only the fifteen units fitted with Radio Electronic Token Block signalling equipment can operate on the West Highland Line.

====East Anglia====
Having originally been based in the East Anglia region but later transferred away, in early 2005 they returned when One received nine from Central Trains in exchange for a similar number of Class 150s.

The units were used on the following local services:
*Bittern Line - to via 
*Wherry Lines - to /
*East Suffolk Line - to /
*Sudbury Branch Line - to 
as well as the longer distance services between to /.

All nine passed to Abellio Greater Anglia when it took over the Greater Anglia franchise in February 2012. Despite being overhauled by Railcare Wolverton in 2012/13, including work to make them comply with disability legislation, all were replaced by Class 755s with the last day of service being 29 January 2020. These then moved to East Midlands Railway, where they were renumbered into the 156/9 subclass.

====Northern England====

Following privatisation, both Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western operated Class 156s and implemented their own refurbishment programmes. The two fleets were united when Northern Rail took over both franchises in 2004.
Within the Northern region, Class 156s are concentrated in the North-West and also the North-East, but are uncommon now in Yorkshire and Humberside, where Class 158s and other unit types are used instead.

In 2011, fourteen Class 156s were fitted with GPS as a trial for Northern Rail, being tested on the Esk Valley line. In 2011 four were transferred to East Midlands Trains.

In January 2015, Northern Rail began to hire 156s to First TransPennine Express to operate Manchester Airport to Blackpool North services. Northern Rail&#x27;s fleet of 42 Class 156s passed to Arriva Rail North when the then-new franchise started on 1 April 2016. The 156s began to operate Manchester Airport to Barrow in Furness and Oxenholme to Windermere services from this date after they along with the Manchester Airport to Blackpool North services were transferred to the franchise.

An additional five Class 156 units transferred to Northern from Abellio ScotRail in late 2018. On 1 March 2020 the Northern units were transferred to new operator Northern Trains.

Fifteen Class 156s are to be transferred from East Midlands Railway to Northern Trains. These units include the nine Class 156/9s formerly used by Greater Anglia. Some of these units are already with Northern Trains, with more due to follow. The delivery of them commenced at the December timetable change in 2021. For the December timetable change in 2022, five more units were transferred. In March 2023 another unit was transferred.

====Midlands====

In 1997, Central Trains inherited twenty units from Regional Railways for use mainly on medium-distance services such as:
*Birmingham to Nottingham via Derby or Leicester
*Birmingham to Hereford
*Birmingham to Shrewsbury and the Cambrian Line
*Nottingham to Skegness or Lincoln

In an attempt at fleet standardisation, preparations were made during 2003 to exchange all 20 Class 156s for an equal number of ScotRail Class 158s, with 156402 partially repainted in ScotRail colours in readiness when overhauled at Wabtec, Doncaster. The transfer did not proceed after the Scottish Government refused to sanction the move, and the rest of the fleet were reliveried into Central Trains&#x27; colours between 2003 and 2005.

Nine units were transferred to One during early 2005, in exchange for a similar number of Class 150s.

At the end of the Central Trains franchise, the remaining 11 units were transferred to East Midlands Trains, who repainted the fleet during 2008 and then carried out a refurbishment program from autumn 2010 onwards. The refurbishment, carried out at Neville Hill depot, included interior refurbishment work, improvements to driving cabs and installation of CCTV. These trains were used on slower medium-distance services such as Nottingham/Derby to Matlock, Nottingham to Skegness, Leicester to Lincoln and Nottingham to Worksop. In May 2011, four additional units were transferred from Northern Rail to allow Nottingham to Liverpool services to be strengthened.

Beginning in late 2019, the nine class 156s transferred to Greater Anglia in 2005, passed to East Midlands Railway. Because they had a different public address and passenger information system to EMR&#x27;s existing Class 156 fleet, they were renumbered into the 156/9 subclass.

In December 2022, four units were sent for storage at Barrow Hill, with East Midlands Railway stating that they will be moved to Ely Papworth sidings at a later date.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 31 January 1995, in the Ais Gill accident, unit 156490 was derailed by a landslide, after which a train travelling in the opposite direction collided with it. The guard aboard 156490, Stuart Wilson, was killed.
*On 6 June 2010, unit 156499 derailed and briefly caught fire after striking a rockfall near Falls of Cruachan station on the Oban branch of the West Highland Line; the fire was quickly put out using on-board fire extinguishers. Eight people were injured.
*On 17 August 2010, unit 156417 was involved in a collision with a slurry tanker at a user-operated level crossing in Suffolk. Twenty-one people were injured, one of them seriously.
*On 18 July 2012, unit 156478 was damaged by landslip debris near Falls of Cruachan stationabout south-west of the location of the 2010 rockfall. The train had been travelling at a reduced speed of approximately due to the risk of rockfall after heavy rain, which potentially prevented it becoming derailed.
*On 21 December 2014, unit 156478 encountered floodwaters on the track near Mauchline (between Kilmarnock and Auchinleck stations). The unit was repaired and refurbished at Brodie Leasing&#x27;s Kilmarnock works and returned to service in October 2016.
*On 22 January 2018, unit 156458 struck a landslip and was derailed between and stations on the West Highland Line. There were no injuries.
*On 7 January 2019, unit 156479 collided with a taxi on the Tyne Valley Line between Newcastle and Carlisle. There were no injuries.
*On 3 May 2024, unit 156443 collided with a car on the level crossing at Redcar Central railway station.

==Models==
Lima produced OO gauge models of Class 156 units, with sixteen variants available in total. Some of these models were subsequently relaunched by Hornby Railways in 2006. 

Realtrack Models released their own OO-gauge Class 156 models in 2017, in Regional Railways Provincial, First ScotRail, and East Midlands Trains liveries.

<text>Dermestidae are a family of Coleoptera that are commonly referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include larder beetle, hide or leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are over 1,800 species described.

Dermestids have a variety of habits; most genera are scavengers that feed on dry animal or plant material, such as skin or pollen, animal hair, feathers, dead insects and natural fibers. Members of &quot;Dermestes&quot; are found in animal carcasses, while others may be found in mammal, bird, bee, or wasp nests. &quot;Thaumaglossa&quot; only lives in the egg cases of mantids, while &quot;Trogoderma&quot; species are pests of grain.

These beetles are significant in forensic entomology. Some species are associated with decaying carcasses, which may help with criminal investigations. Some species are pests (urban entomology) and can cause extensive damage to natural fibers in homes and places of business.

They are used in taxidermy and by natural history museums to clean animal skeletons. Some dermestid species, commonly called &quot;bow bugs&quot;, infest violin cases, feeding on the bow hair.

== Description ==
Adult Dermestidae are generally small beetles (1–12 mm long), rounded to oval in shape, with hairy or scaly elytra that may form distinctive and colourful patterns. Except in genera &quot;Dermestes&quot; and &quot;Trichelodes&quot;, there is a single ocellus in the middle of the head. The antennae are clubbed (except in male &quot;Thylodrias contractus&quot;) and usually fit into a groove on the underside of the thorax, concealing them when the beetle is at rest. Adult females of &quot;T. contractus&quot; are notable for being larviform, meaning they retain a larval morphology even into adulthood.

Larval Dermestidae range from 5 to 15 mm long and are usually covered in tufts of long, dense hairs (setae). In subfamily Megatominae and the genus &quot;Trinodes&quot;, some of these setae are hastisetae: barbed setae ending in spear-like heads (&quot;hasta&quot; being the Latin word for &quot;spear&quot;). Hastisetae serve a defensive role, detaching and entangling predators.

Pupae of subfamilies Dermestinae and Attageninae are covered in structures known as gin-traps, as defense against predators. Pupae of Megatominae are protected within the exuviae of the last larval instar.

==Diet and behaviour==

Dermestid larvae are typically found on dry organic items that are hard for other organisms to digest, such as dried foodstuffs, skins, hides, wood and other natural fibers. In forensic studies, the larvae are found on human corpses during the dry and skeletal phases of decomposition, which occurs several days after death. Larvae also move away from light and often hide in any cavity in order to remain undisturbed. In natural habitats, they can be found on animal carcasses, under bark, and in the webs, nests and burrows of various animals.

Larvae of subfamilies Dermestinae and Attageninae (which lack hastisetae), burrow into feeding substrates, pupate in concealed locations, and show fast escape behaviours when disturbed. Larvae of Megatominae (which have hastisetae), do not burrow, pupate where they have been feeding, and their response to disturbance is to stop moving, arch the body and spread the hastisetae. This difference may be because hastisetae would be a hindrance for burrowing larvae.

Adult dermestids are known to feed on pollen and nectar. Adults of &quot;Dermestes&quot; are cannibalistic and will eat young larvae and pupae; this means that when kept in captivity, adults should be placed in separate containers from the immature stages.

==Economic relevance==
===Urban and stored products===

Dermestid beetles are destructive to a number of common items. Natural fibers such as wool, silk, cotton, linen, fur, or feathers are much more prone to attack than synthetic fibers. Dermestids also attack chocolate, copra, and cocoa beans.

=== Medical ===
Dermestid hastisetae (a specific group of detachable setae from the larvae of subfamily Megatominae), both those attached to exuviae and those shed by larvae, cause health problems in humans when inhaled (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma), ingested in contaminated food (nausea, fever, diarrhea, proctitis, perianal itching) or touched with skin (dermatitis).

===Forensic===

&quot;Dermestes maculatus&quot;, hide beetles, also have the potential to offer investigators an estimation of the time since death in homicide or questionable cases. Similar to the use of flies in forensic entomology, the arrival of &quot;D. maculatus&quot; to carrion occurs in a predictable succession. Adult &quot;D. maculatus&quot; beetles generally arrive 5 to 11 days after death. In an attempt to refine this relatively wide range, recent research has repeated arthropod succession studies. These studies are applied to estimate the arrival of various species of Dermestidae after death. Development for dermestids is temperature dependent, and the optimal temperature for &quot;D. maculatus&quot; is 30 °C. Development data is normalized using Accumulated Degree Days. Dermestids can also be used in cases involving entomotoxicology, where feces and shed larval skins can be analyzed for toxins.

&quot;Dermestes maculatus&quot; collected from raccoon carcass:
== Evolution ==
While possible members of the family have been described from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic based on isolated elytra, the oldest known unambiguous member of the family is &quot;Paradermestes&quot; from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of China, which appears to belong to the subfamily Dermestinae. Members of the subfamilies Attageninae and Megatominae are known from the Cretaceous, including the living genera &quot;Attagenus&quot; and &quot;Megatoma.&quot; The ancestral ecology of the group was likely mycophagy, which is retained in Orphilinae, with the ancestor of most other lineages making the transition to saprophagy.

===Larder beetles===

The larva of the larder beetle &quot;Dermestes lardarius&quot; is longer than the adult and is covered in reddish brown or black setae. It has two back-curved, spine-like appendages on the posterior end. The larva of the black larder beetle has less strongly curved appendages. Mature larvae of both species tend to bore into hard substrates such as wood, cork, and plaster to pupate.

Larder beetles are infrequent household pests. Adults and larvae feed on raw skins and hides. Adult larder beetles are generally 1/3 to 3/8 of an inch long and are dark brown with a broad, pale yellow spotted band across the upper portion of the elytra. There are three black dots arranged in a triangle shape on each wing. The sternum and legs of the larder beetle are covered in fine, yellow setae. Adult larder beetles are typically found outdoors in protected areas during the winter, but during the spring and early summer they enter buildings. Females lay approximately 135 eggs near a food source, and the eggs will hatch in about 12 days. The life cycle of larder beetles lasts around 40 to 50 days.

The black larder or incinerator beetle, &quot;Dermestes ater&quot;, is completely dark with scattered yellow setae on the body. It is similar to &quot;Dermestes maculatus&quot; but lacks serrations on its elytra. Its ventral surface is yellow instead of white. This beetle is a pest of fish, mushrooms, and cheese.

===Hide beetle (leather beetle)===
&quot;Dermestes maculatus&quot;, known as the hide beetle, leather beetle, or skin beetle, feeds on raw skins and hides like the larder beetle. This species is similar in appearance to the larder beetle, with larvae covered in short and long reddish brown or black setae, but its two spine-like posterior appendages curve forward. Also, in adults, the forewings are dark brown and the sternum is mostly white with some black. Its life cycle is 60 to 70 days and the female can lay up to 800 eggs.

The hide and larder beetles both feed on an assortment of animal protein based products and cause serious damage in the areas of silkworm production and museums.

===Carpet beetle===

Carpet beetle larvae start to feed as soon as they hatch. They are carrot shaped and heavily covered with setae, especially on their posterior end. The number of instars typically ranges from five to 11 and in some cases may reach as high as 20. Larvae of the black carpet beetle &quot;Attagenus megatoma&quot; may grow up to and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of carpet beetle are regularly long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source. The larvae of the carpet beetle are often referred to as &quot;woolly bears&quot; or &quot;buffalo moths&quot;.

===Black carpet beetle===

The black carpet beetle, &quot;Attagenus megatoma&quot;, is a widely known stored product pest and one of the most destructive because of its potential damage to household products containing keratin, which is a protein found in animal hair and feathers. They are also able to burrow through various types of food packaging, allowing passage for other insects.

Females can lay up to 90 eggs and they hatch in about 8 to 15 days. Generally, this species only has one generation a year. The time it takes to become an adult varies from six months to a year. In addition, an adult black carpet beetle can live for an additional two months. The average adult size is about 2.8 to 5 mm long and they are oval, dark brown to shiny-black in color, and have brown legs.

===Varied carpet beetle===

The varied carpet beetle, &quot;Anthrenus verbasci&quot;, attacks typical household objects. Carpet beetles are normally associated with things such as carpets, wool, furs, and any processed animal or plant food. Their appetite also includes dead insects, spiders, and even nectar and pollen. They are typically found throughout the United States and Canada. Females can lay up to 40 eggs and the number of larval instars is seven or eight. The time it takes to become an adult varies from about eight months to a year. In addition, the adults can live around 2 to 6 weeks. This species varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of scales. On average, the adults are 2 to 3 mm in length and have scales that vary from white, brown, yellow, or even gray-yellow. The hairs of the larvae can cause allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis or blisters in humans who come into contact with the sharp tiny hairs.

===Khapra beetle===

On hatching, the larvae of khapra beetle (&quot;Trogoderma granarium&quot;) are around 1.6 to 1.8 mm long and mostly covered with dense setae, some simple and some barbed. Larvae are yellow-white but the head and body setae are brown. As the larvae further develop, their color changes to a golden or reddish brown and the abdomen portion becomes proportionally shorter. The mature larvae reach a maximum length of 6 mm long and 1.5 mm wide.

The khapra beetle is a stored-product pest. Infestations are difficult to control because they crawl into cracks and crevices, remaining for long periods of time. They tend to infest grains and create serious losses to stored products. The adults are covered with setae and are approximately 1.5 to 3 mm long and 1 to 2 mm wide. Male khapra beetles are brown to black with reddish brown markings on the elytra. Females are slightly larger and are lighter in color. The short, 11 segmented antennae has a club of 3 to 5 segments, which fit into a groove on the side of the pronotum.

==Control==
===Hide and larder beetles===

Modern methods of meat slaughtering, storage, and distribution have reduced potential infestations of hide beetles. Proper housekeeping is crucial for the prevention of infestations. Dead insects in homes usually attract these beetles because they are a prime food source for hide and larder beetles. Food must be tightly sealed or stored in a refrigerator to avoid any beetle access. Freezing food for a week or heating meat in a pan or microwave for prolonged lengths can kill insects found in infested foods and prevent them from spreading.

Household fibers, such as wool and silk, are especially prone to moth damage and special cleaning, which includes moth proofing, needs to be done frequently. Application of insecticides must be by spot treatment to crack and crevice sites where they are suspected of hiding. Pyrethrins are labeled for use against hide beetles. Insecticides used for carpet beetles are also appropriate to use against hide and larder beetles.

===Carpet beetles===

Regular cleaning of spilled food or lint will eliminate any sites for potential breeding. Susceptible items like food, woolens, and furs should be stored in an insect-proof container. If an infestation is suspected then the source of the problem must be removed and destroyed to further limit any possibility of spreading. These beetles can be killed with extreme heat or exposure to freezers.

Pyrethroid insecticides can be used to control carpet beetles. These contain active ingredients such as permethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin and tralomethrin.

Diatomaceous earth is also effective.

<doc id="988180" wikidata="Q2357491" url="?curid=988180" title="HMS Bluebell (K80)">
<text>HMS &quot;Bluebell&quot; was a that served in the Royal Navy in World War II. Ordered from Fleming &amp; Ferguson of Paisley, Scotland on 27 July 1939, she was launched on 24 April 1940 and commissioned in July 1940. She served in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Arctic campaigns, escorting several convoys to Russia, and also took part in the invasions of Sicily and France. She was torpedoed and sunk by in the Kola Inlet on 17 February 1945 while escorting the convoy RA 64 from Murmansk. Only one member of her crew survived.

==Service history==
After commissioning and sea trials in July 1940, &quot;Bluebell&quot; was deployed on Atlantic convoy escort duties. One of her first duties, in October 1940, was to meet Convoy SC 7 mid-ocean. She rescued all 39 officers and men from the cargo steamship , which had been torpedoed and sunk on 17 October.

In January 1941 &quot;Bluebell&quot; was attached to the 5th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, based at Liverpool, to escort Atlantic convoys, transferring in September to the 37th Escort Group for the defence of convoys between Gibraltar and ports in West Africa. She returned to the UK in July 1942 to refit, and was assigned for service on the Russian Convoys. In September she sailed to Iceland to join the escort of Convoy PQ 18 to Arkhangelsk, returning in November, and resuming Atlantic convoy escort duties in December and January. In February 1943 she joined the escort of Convoy JW 53 from Loch Ewe to Kola Inlet, returning in March to resume duties in the Western Approaches.

In June 1943 &quot;Bluebell&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean, and in early July was part of the escort for assault convoys during the initial landings in the Allied invasion of Sicily, remaining in the Mediterranean for further convoy escort duties until August when she returned to the Western Approaches.

Between February and April 1944 she escorted Russian Convoys JW 57 and JW 58, and in May was transferred to Escort Group 143 to prepare for the invasion of Normandy. On 6 June she formed part of Convoy ECL1 escorting LSTs from the Bristol Channel to the landing beaches, then escorted follow-up convoys until released on 25 June. In August she was transferred to the 8th Escort Group and joined the escort force for Russian Convoy JW 59, returning in September.

After further convoy defence and interception duties, on 2 February 1945 she was attached to the escort for Russian Convoy JW 64. After arriving at Kola Inlet she took part in anti-submarine operations against U-boats known to be gathering to carry out attacks on the return convoy. On 17 February, as Convoy RA 64 was assembling off Murmansk, &quot;Bluebell&quot; was hit in the stern by an acoustic homing torpedo fired by , which caused her depth charges to explode. She sank in less than 30 seconds at . From her crew of 86 ratings and officers there was only one survivor.

<text>The British Democratic Party (BDP) was a short-lived far-right political party in the United Kingdom. A breakaway group from the National Front, the BDP was severely damaged after it became involved in a gun-running sting and was absorbed by the British National Party.

==Formation and naming controversy==
The BDP emerged following the 1979 general election in which the National Front (NF) had put up the greatest number of candidates in its history. Despite this, results fell way below the party&#x27;s expectations. The recriminations that followed this financially costly defeat saw Andrew Brons replace John Tyndall as chairman whilst a number of groups broke away from the NF, notably the New National Front and the Constitutional Movement.

Within the NF, the Leicester branch had become one of the most active in the country and, since 1972, this group had been led by Anthony Reed Herbert, a local solicitor whose talent for organisation had made Leicester a model branch. Reed Herbert took the opportunity provided by the 1979 collapse of the NF to launch his own group, initially selecting the name British Peoples Party. However, the name was quickly changed in order to avoid association with the earlier British People&#x27;s Party, a splinter group from the National Socialist League, organised either side of the Second World War. The name was thus changed to British Democratic Party even though a British Democratic Party, a minor right-wing anti-communist group, had also previously existed in the 1930s.

The BDP shared with the Constitutional Movement a desire to move away from open neo-Nazism in general and Tyndall and Martin Webster in particular, with Reed Herbert reasoning that a stream of press exposures of the more extreme views of both men had hit the NF&#x27;s election chances hard. Effectively therefore the BDP sought to present a more &quot;respectable&quot; public image in contrast to that of the NF.

==Development==
The BDP quickly gained a following within Leicester, capturing 11% of the vote in the first local elections it contested, a highly respectable score for a new and virtually unknown party. However the British Movement&#x27;s Ray Hill also became involved and, after giving a copy of the party&#x27;s membership list to &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine, soon began secretly working for the anti-fascist publication full-time. Although never formally a member of the BDP Hill, on instructions from &quot;Searchlight&quot;, took a leading role in helping Reed Herbert to organise the new party. Hill also took over production of the party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;British News&quot;. Hill&#x27;s association with both the BDP and BM was not unusual as BDP members Dave Gagin, Chris Newman, Jack Munton and Chris Harrison all held simultaneous membership of the BM.

The association of Hill with the BDP meant that many of its activities were exposed in the press. Thus a celebration for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday held in 1980 in an illegal bar in the basement of the party&#x27;s headquarters was reported in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Hill also fomented a plan to take over the British Movement, suggesting to Reed Herbert that the two groups could unite once it was successful, although this idea too was driven by a &quot;Searchlight&quot; plan to bring about divisions within the BM. Hill further informed the magazine on BDP plans to obtain weapons and to set up an illegal television transmitter, although information about both schemes was initially vague.

==&quot;World in Action&quot; incident==
The BDP became embroiled in a 1981 scheme developed by the &quot;World in Action&quot; documentary series in which an American claiming to be a neo-Nazi gunrunner (but who was actually working for the programme) was put in touch with the BDP. Before long, Hill became involved in order to facilitate the sting. &#x27;Bob Matthews&#x27;, as the American claimed to be called, told Reed Herbert that he needed a gun in order to raid a US Army armoury, and Reed Herbert agreed to supply a single weapon for £200. BDP member John Grand Scrutton was chosen to ferry the weapon, a luger pistol, to a secret location arranged in advance with &#x27;Matthews&#x27; before phoning the American to let him know more details. The resulting phone call, in which Scrutton suggested that the BDP could get hold of six more guns and told &#x27;Matthews&#x27; to send payments to Reed Herbert&#x27;s address, was recorded by &quot;World in Action&quot; and broadcast on the show.

Reed Herbert learned of the ruse from a journalist immediately prior to the broadcast of the episode as did Scrutton, whose finger prints were on the luger which by that point was in police custody. Reed Herbert sent Scrutton, under Hill&#x27;s care, to a hideout in the Republic of Ireland but before long Scrutton returned to Britain and had to be brought back to Ireland by Hill. Reed Herbert eventually told Scrutton to go to South Africa and Scrutton, along with Hill, was put on a plane that stopped over at Paris-Orly Airport. However Hill had informed &quot;Searchlight&quot; about the plan and they in turn had tipped off the French authorities who arrested Scrutton and Hill before sending them back to Ireland. Under Hill&#x27;s prompting, Scrutton contacted the show&#x27;s producer Geoffrey Seed and, after three days of interviews, they convinced him to return to Leicester and give himself up to police. Scrutton eventually returned and made a full statement, but despite this statement, no charges were ever brought against Scrutton or any member of the BDP in regards to the weapons offences.

==Disappearance==
Despite the incident Hill, who had moved on to a new plan to work with and undermine John Tyndall, remained close to the BDP and sought to continue working to damage the party. At this time the party also enjoyed the support of influential publisher Anthony Hancock, although he too was close to the BM and was less sure about Tyndall. Nonetheless, the gun-running incident forced the BDP to cease almost all operations, and it came as little surprise when it was brought to a conclusion in 1982 by re-joining Tyndall and Hill as founder members of the British National Party.

<text>The Zürcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV, Zurich Transport Network) is the largest public transportation network in Switzerland. It covers the canton of Zurich and adjacent areas. All modes of public transportation (rail, light rail, bus, trolleybus, lake passenger liner, funicular) within a chosen number of zones can be used freely with a ticket that is valid for a certain amount of time (one hour, 24 hours, 1 month, 1 year).  

== History ==
The system was established in May 1990 as a unified fare system with a coordinated local train network. Local train lines were prefixed with the letter S (S-Bahn) to form the Zurich S-Bahn network. A proof-of-payment fare system is in force on all ZVV vehicles. Fare gates are not used, but those caught without a valid ticket during a random inspection face a minimum fine of CHF 100.

== Zones ==
The ZVV system uses an integrated a ticket network. The zones are numbered 110–184; the numbers 180–184 designates zones outside of the canton&#x27;s border. Passengers purchase a base ticket for particular zones. Upgrades and extension tickets are available as supplements.

Trips by fast trains and regional trains by any operator, such as ICN, InterCity (IC), InterRegio (IR), RegioExpress (RE), regional (R) lines, and even international railways are part of the fare network as long as they stop within the fare network&#x27;s borders.

The zone system approach has been adopted by many other fare networks in Switzerland, such as libero (fare network) in cantons of Bern and Solothurn, and OSTWIND in Thurgau, St. Gallen, Glarus, both Appenzells (AI and AR), and Fürstentum Liechtenstein.

For journeys just beyond ZVV&#x27;s borders, some zones of the neighboring cantons&#x27; fare networks are combined within the extended fare network Z-Pass:

*Aargau: &quot;Corridor A-Welle–ZVV&quot;
*Thurgau/St. Gallen/Glarus: &quot;Corridor OSTWIND–ZVV&quot;
*Schwyz/Zug: &quot;Corridor Schwyz-Zug–ZVV&quot;

== Operators ==
The operators that make up the ZVV are:

*Aargau Verkehr
*Busbetriebe Bamert
*Dolderbahn
*Forchbahn
*Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg
*Polybahn
*PostAuto Schweiz Region Zürich
*Schifffahrts-Genossenschaft Greifensee (SGG)
*Schneider Busbetriebe
*Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn
*Stadtbus Winterthur
*Südostbahn (SOB) 
*Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)
*THURBO
*Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG)
*Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ)
*Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee und Oberland (VZO)
*Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG)

== Leadership ==
The current director of the ZVV is Dominik Brühwiler, appointed 1. January 2021. Dominik Brühwiler was Head of the Traffic Planning Department and Deputy Director for 13 years. Over 60 people applied for the position of Director and the Swiss Department for Transport picked him because of his past experience in the service.

<doc id="988191" wikidata="Q1154597" url="?curid=988191" title="Polygon mesh">
<text>In 3D computer graphics and solid modeling, a polygon mesh is a collection of , s and s that defines the shape of a polyhedral object&#x27;s surface. It simplifies rendering, as in a wire-frame model. The faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex polygons (n-gons). A polygonal mesh may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.

The study of polygon meshes is a large sub-field of computer graphics (specifically 3D computer graphics) and geometric modeling. Different representations of polygon meshes are used for different applications and goals. The variety of operations performed on meshes includes Boolean logic (Constructive solid geometry), smoothing, and simplification. Algorithms also exist for ray tracing, collision detection, and rigid-body dynamics with polygon meshes. If the mesh&#x27;s edges are rendered instead of the faces, then the model becomes a wireframe model.

Several methods exist for mesh generation, including the marching cubes algorithm.

Volumetric meshes are distinct from polygon meshes in that they explicitly represent both the surface and interior region of a structure, while polygon meshes only explicitly represent the surface (the volume is implicit).

== Elements ==
Objects created with polygon meshes must store different types of elements. These include vertices, edges, faces, polygons and surfaces. In many applications, only vertices, edges and either faces or polygons are stored. A renderer may support only 3-sided faces, so polygons must be constructed of many of these, as shown above. However, many renderers either support quads and higher-sided polygons, or are able to convert polygons to triangles on the fly, making it unnecessary to store a mesh in a triangulated form. 
 





== Representations ==

Polygon meshes may be represented in a variety of ways, using different methods to store the vertex, edge and face data. These include:
 
 


Each of the representations above have particular advantages and drawbacks, further discussed in Smith (2006).

The choice of the data structure is governed by the application, the performance required, size of the data, and the operations to be performed. For example, it is easier to deal with triangles than general polygons, especially in computational geometry. For certain operations it is necessary to have a fast access to topological information such as edges or neighboring faces; this requires more complex structures such as the winged-edge representation. For hardware rendering, compact, simple structures are needed; thus the corner-table (triangle fan) is commonly incorporated into low-level rendering APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL.

=== Vertex-vertex meshes ===
Vertex-vertex meshes represent an object as a set of vertices connected to other vertices. This is the simplest representation, but not widely used since the face and edge information is implicit. Thus, it is necessary to traverse the data in order to generate a list of faces for rendering. In addition, operations on edges and faces are not easily accomplished.

However, VV meshes benefit from small storage space and efficient morphing of shape. The above figure shows a four-sided box as represented by a VV mesh. Each vertex indexes its neighboring vertices. The last two vertices, 8 and 9 at the top and bottom center of the &quot;box-cylinder&quot;, have four connected vertices rather than five. A general system must be able to handle an arbitrary number of vertices connected to any given vertex.

For a complete description of VV meshes see Smith (2006).

=== Face-vertex meshes ===
Face-vertex meshes represent an object as a set of faces and a set of vertices. This is the most widely used mesh representation, being the input typically accepted by modern graphics hardware.

Face-vertex meshes improve on VV mesh for modeling in that they allow explicit lookup of the vertices of a face, and the faces surrounding a vertex. The above figure shows the &quot;box-cylinder&quot; example as an FV mesh. Vertex v5 is highlighted to show the faces that surround it. Notice that, in this example, every face is required to have exactly 3 vertices. However, this does not mean every vertex has the same number of surrounding faces.

For rendering, the face list is usually transmitted to the GPU as a set of indices to vertices, and the vertices are sent as position/color/normal structures (in the figure, only position is given). This has the benefit that changes in shape, but not geometry, can be dynamically updated by simply resending the vertex data without updating the face connectivity.

Modeling requires easy traversal of all structures. With face-vertex meshes it is easy to find the vertices of a face. Also, the vertex list contains a list of faces connected to each vertex. Unlike VV meshes, both faces and vertices are explicit, so locating neighboring faces and vertices is constant time. However, the edges are implicit, so a search is still needed to find all the faces surrounding a given face. Other dynamic operations, such as splitting or merging a face, are also difficult with face-vertex meshes.

=== Winged-edge meshes ===
Introduced by Baumgart in 1975, winged-edge meshes explicitly represent the vertices, faces, and edges of a mesh. This representation is widely used in modeling programs to provide the greatest flexibility in dynamically changing the mesh geometry, because split and merge operations can be done quickly. Their primary drawback is large storage requirements and increased complexity due to maintaining many indices. A good discussion of implementation issues of Winged-edge meshes may be found in the book &quot;Graphics Gems II&quot;.

Winged-edge meshes address the issue of traversing from edge to edge, and providing an ordered set of faces around an edge. For any given edge, the number of outgoing edges may be arbitrary. To simplify this, winged-edge meshes provide only four, the nearest clockwise and counter-clockwise edges at each end. The other edges may be traversed incrementally. The information for each edge therefore resembles a butterfly, hence &quot;winged-edge&quot; meshes. The above figure shows the &quot;box-cylinder&quot; as a winged-edge mesh. The total data for an edge consists of 2 vertices (endpoints), 2 faces (on each side), and 4 edges (winged-edge).

Rendering of winged-edge meshes for graphics hardware requires generating a Face index list, which is usually done only when the geometry changes. Winged-edge meshes are ideally suited for dynamic geometry, such as subdivision surfaces and interactive modeling, since changes to the mesh can occur locally. Traversal across the mesh, as might be needed for collision detection, can be accomplished efficiently.

See Baumgart (1975) for more details.

=== Render dynamic meshes ===

Winged-edge meshes are not the only representation which allows for dynamic changes to geometry. A new representation which combines winged-edge meshes and face-vertex meshes is the render dynamic mesh, which explicitly stores both, the vertices of a face and faces of a vertex (like FV meshes), and the faces and vertices of an edge (like winged-edge).

Render dynamic meshes require slightly less storage space than standard winged-edge meshes, and can be directly rendered by graphics hardware since the face list contains an index of vertices. In addition, traversal from vertex to face is explicit (constant time), as is from face to vertex. RD meshes do not require the four outgoing edges since these can be found by traversing from edge to face, then face to neighboring edge.

RD meshes benefit from the features of winged-edge meshes by allowing for geometry to be dynamically updated.

See Tobler &amp; Maierhofer (WSCG 2006) for more details.

== Summary of mesh representation ==


In the above table, &quot;explicit&quot; indicates that the operation can be performed in constant time, as the data is directly stored; &quot;list compare&quot; indicates that a list comparison between two lists must be performed to accomplish the operation; and &quot;pair search&quot; indicates a search must be done on two indices. The notation &quot;avg(V,V)&quot; means the average number of vertices connected to a given vertex; &quot;avg(E,V)&quot; means the average number of edges connected to a given vertex, and &quot;avg(F,V)&quot; is the average number of faces connected to a given vertex.

The notation &quot;V → f1, f2, f3, ... → v1, v2, v3, ...&quot; describes that a traversal across multiple elements is required to perform the operation. For example, to get &quot;all vertices around a given vertex V&quot; using the face-vertex mesh, it is necessary to first find the faces around the given vertex V using the vertex list. Then, from those faces, use the face list to find the vertices around them. Winged-edge meshes explicitly store nearly all information, and other operations always traverse to the edge first to get additional info. Vertex-vertex meshes are the only representation that explicitly stores the neighboring vertices of a given vertex.

As the mesh representations become more complex (from left to right in the summary), the amount of information explicitly stored increases. This gives more direct, constant time, access to traversal and topology of various elements but at the cost of increased overhead and space in maintaining indices properly.

Figure 7 shows the connectivity information for each of the four technique described in this article. Other representations also exist, such as half-edge and corner tables. These are all variants of how vertices, faces and edges index one another.

As a general rule, face-vertex meshes are used whenever an object must be rendered on graphics hardware that does not change geometry (connectivity), but may deform or morph shape (vertex positions) such as real-time rendering of static or morphing objects. Winged-edge or render dynamic meshes are used when the geometry changes, such as in interactive modeling packages or for computing subdivision surfaces. Vertex-vertex meshes are ideal for efficient, complex changes in geometry or topology so long as hardware rendering is not of concern.

<text>Sir John Collings Squire (2 April 1884 – 20 December 1958) was an English writer, most notable as editor of the &quot;London Mercury&quot;, a major literary magazine in the interwar period. He antagonised several eminent authors, but attracted a coterie that was dubbed the Squirearchy. He was also a poet and historian, who captained a famous literary cricket-team called the Invalids.

== Biography ==
Born in Plymouth, he was educated at Blundell&#x27;s School and St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was one of those published in the Georgian poetry collections of Edward Marsh. His own &quot;Selections from Modern Poets&quot; anthology series, launched in 1921, became definitive of the conservative style of &quot;Georgian poetry&quot;.

He began reviewing for &quot;The New Age&quot;; through his wife he had met Alfred Orage. His literary reputation was first made by a flair for parody, in a column &quot;Imaginary Speeches&quot; in &quot;The New Age&quot; from 1909.

His poetry from World War I was satirical; at the time he was reviewing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, using the name Solomon Eagle (taken from a Quaker of the seventeenth century) – one of his reviews from 1915 was of &quot;The Rainbow&quot; by D. H. Lawrence. Squire had been appointed literary editor when the &quot;New Statesman&quot; was set up in 1912; he was noted as an adept and quick journalist, at ease with contributing to all parts of the journal. He was acting editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1917–18, when Clifford Sharp was in the British Army, and more than competently sustained the periodical. When the war ended he found himself with a network of friends and backers, controlling a substantial part of London&#x27;s literary press.

From 1919 to 1934, Squire was the editor of the monthly periodical, the &quot;London Mercury&quot;. It showcased the work of the Georgian poets and was an important outlet for new writers. Alec Waugh described the elements of Squire&#x27;s &#x27;hegemony&#x27; as acquired largely by accident, consequent on his rejection for military service for bad sight. Squire&#x27;s natural persona was of a beer-drinking, cricketing West Countryman; his literary cricket XI, the Invalids (originally made up of men who had been wounded in the First World War), were immortalised in A. G. Macdonell&#x27;s &quot;England, Their England&quot;, with Squire as Mr. William Hodge, editor of the &quot;London Weekly&quot;. In July 1927 he became an early radio commentator on Wimbledon.

In his book &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot; (1931) he collected a series of essays, many of which could be considered alternative histories, from some of the leading historians of the period (including Hilaire Belloc and Winston Churchill); in America it was published that same year in somewhat different form under the title &quot;If: or, History Rewritten&quot;.

Squire was knighted in 1933, and after leaving the &quot;London Mercury&quot; in 1934, he became a reader for Macmillans, the publishers; in 1937, he became a reviewer for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;.

His eldest son was Raglan Squire, an architect known for his work at Rangoon University in the 1950s, as the architect for the conversion of the houses in Eaton Sq, London into flats thus ensuring the preservation of that great London Square, and many buildings including offices and hotels in the Middle East and elsewhere. His second son was Anthony Squire, a pilot film director (&quot;The Sound Barrier&quot;). His third son Maurice was killed in the Second War while his youngest daughter Julia Baker (née Squire) was a costume designer for theatre and cinema. She married the actor George Baker.

Squire was an expert on Stilton cheese. He also loathed Jazz music, having filed a complaint with BBC radio to demand it stop playing Benny Goodman&#x27;s music, which he called &quot;an awful series of jungle noises which can hearten no man.&quot;

==Politics==

Squire had joined the Marxist Social Democratic Federation, as a young man. During his time at the &quot;New Statesman&quot; he wrote as a &quot;Fabian liberal&quot;. In the 1918 general election he was the Labour candidate for the Cambridge University seat. His views then moved steadily rightwards.

Squire met Benito Mussolini in 1933, and was one of the founders of the January Club, set up on 1 January 1934. He held in it the position of chairman or Secretary, and claimed that it was not a Fascist organisation. It was a dining club with invited speakers, and was closely connected to Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, which nominated members. According to the historian Sir Charles Petrie (who, like Squire, wrote regularly for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;), Squire &quot;found the atmosphere uncongenial before long&quot;.

==Reputation==

The Bloomsbury group named the coterie of writers that surrounded Squire as the &quot;Squirearchy&quot;. Alan Pryce-Jones was Squire&#x27;s assistant on the &quot;Mercury&quot; and wrote

In a fairly recent study, the academic Leonard Diepeveen explored the particularly strained relationship between Squire and literary Modernists:
Squire is generally credited with the one-liner &quot;I am not so think as you drunk I am&quot;, which appeared as the refrain of his &quot;Ballade of Soporific Absorption&quot;.

T. S. Eliot accused Squire of using the &quot;London Mercury&quot; to saturate literary London with journalistic and popular criticism. According to Robert H. Ross

John Middleton Murry took an adversarial line towards Squire, seeing his &quot;London Mercury&quot; as in direct competition with his own &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;. Roy Campbell sometimes mocked Squire in verse.

Since his death the reputation of Squire has declined; scholarship has absorbed the strictures of his contemporaries, such as F. S. Flint, openly critical of Squire in 1920. Squire is now considered to be on the &quot;blimpish&quot; wing of the reaction to modernist work.

A reappraisal of the periodical network of early twentieth-century literary London, and problems with the term &quot;modernism&quot;, have encouraged scholars to cast their nets beyond the traditional venue of modernism – the little magazine – to seek to better understand the role mass-market periodicals such as the &quot;London Mercury&quot; played in promoting new and progressive writers.

<doc id="988197" wikidata="Q516216" url="?curid=988197" title="Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)">
<text>Andrew Mullen Gray (born 30 November 1955) is a Scottish football broadcaster and former player.

He played as a forward for Dundee United, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Everton, Aston Villa, Notts County (on loan), West Bromwich Albion, Rangers and Cheltenham Town. He won 20 caps for Scotland. He also had a season as Ron Atkinson&#x27;s assistant at Aston Villa when he retired from playing, juggling that role with his Sky Sports duties. He decided to go into broadcasting full time in 1993.

Gray was the lead football pundit for Sky Sports (since it began its broadcast of the Premier League in August 1992) and was the channel&#x27;s co-commentator for nearly 19 years (often working alongside Martin Tyler) until his dismissal in January 2011, following multiple allegations of sexism. Gray, along with former Sky Sports anchor Richard Keys, then signed for talkSPORT in February 2011. They both now work for beIN Sports in Doha, Qatar; since June 2013 they have been the main presenters of Premier League and UEFA Champions League match broadcasts within the Middle East and North Africa region.

==Club career==
Born in Glasgow and with a mother from the Isle of Lewis, Gray started his professional career as a player with Dundee United, where he scored 36 goals in 62 appearances He also played for Dundee United in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final finishing on the losing side as Celtic ran out 3–0 winners.

In October 1975, at the age of 19, he moved south to Aston Villa (newly promoted to the First Division) for £110,000 and was joint winner of England&#x27;s golden boot with Arsenal&#x27;s Malcolm Macdonald in 1976–77. His 29 goals helped Villa to a fourth-place finish and victory in the League Cup, and earned him the PFA Young Player of the Year and PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year awards, a double matched by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 and Gareth Bale in 2013. At the time he was the youngest player to earn the Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, and the first player to win more than one of the official three player of the year awards in the same season.

Gray moved to Villa&#x27;s local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers on 8 September 1979. His signing was announced to the fans and media prior to The Wolves kick off at home to Crystal Palace, as a pre match celebration at the Molineux for an English record transfer fee of £1.49m. After scoring the winning goal for Wolves in the 1980 League Cup final, he remained with the club through their relegation in 1982 (despite interest from Manchester United) and promotion a year later.

Gray moved to Everton in November 1983 for £250,000. He spent two seasons with the Merseyside club, winning the FA Cup in May 1984. Gray scored in the final against Watford in controversial fashion by heading the ball out of the Watford&#x27;s goalkeeper&#x27;s hands. A year later, he won the League Championship and European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, also scoring in the final of the latter. He also reached another FA Cup final, but this time he was on the losing side as Everton were defeated by Manchester United. Then came the arrival of England striker Gary Lineker from Leicester City in the 1985 close season. Despite angry petitions from Everton fans wanting to keep Gray at Goodison Park, he left the club on 10 July 1985, returning to Aston Villa in a £150,000 deal.

Despite starting the decade on a high as league champions in 1981 and European Cup winners in 1982, Villa had now declined to mid table mediocrity and the return of Gray was unable to turn things around as his arrival at Everton had done. He scored five goals from 35 league games in 1985–86 as Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, and the following season he didn&#x27;t score in 19 league games as Villa fell into the Second Division. He began the 1987–88 season still with Villa, but was transferred to their local rivals West Bromwich Albion in September 1987 having not featured in a first team game for Villa that season. His spell at Albion lasted less than a year, and was uneventful as they narrowly avoided relegation from the Second Division.

In mid-1988, he joined Rangers. He spent one season at Ibrox, helping them win the Scottish Premier Division title – the first of nine successive titles they would win. He dropped into non-league football with Football Conference club Cheltenham Town in summer 1989, and scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 home win over Chorley on 21 October 1989, before retiring in 1990.

==International career==
Gray&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; accolades in England were surprisingly not enough to convince Scotland manager Ally MacLeod to select him for the 1978 World Cup squad. Gray won 20 caps for Scotland, scoring 7 goals for his country. He also won four caps at Under-23 level and played at schoolboy level. His full international debut came on 17 December 1975 in a 1–1 draw with Romania. He was not selected for any of Scotland&#x27;s World Cup squads during his playing days. His final senior appearance for Scotland came on 28 May 1985 in a 1–0 win over Iceland in a 1986 World Cup qualifier. This had been his first cap for two years, despite him scoring twice in his penultimate appearance for the national side on 19 June 1983 in a 2–0 friendly win over Canada, and him excelling on the club level for Everton after his transfer to the Merseyside club later in 1983.

==Coaching==
After retiring as a player, Gray entered coaching as an assistant to Ron Atkinson at Aston Villa before focusing full-time on his television work.

==Commentary career==
Gray appeared as a pundit on ITV&#x27;s World Cup coverage in 1978 and during the mid-1980s he appeared fairly regularly on the BBC&#x27;s coverage, including at the 1986 World Cup. Towards the end of his playing career, he worked as a pundit on STV in Scotland, where he worked alongside Andy Melvin, the producer who would eventually take him to Sky Sports.

After leaving coaching, Gray became a football commentator, pundit, and analyst on Sky Sports, serving as a Scottish facet of its Premier League coverage since its inception in 1992, most notably alongside studio anchor Richard Keys and lead match commentators Martin Tyler and Ian Darke. In addition, he reported for Sky from Euro 2004 in Portugal, although Sky did not have broadcast rights for the games. He commentated for BBC Radio 5 Live in the 2002 World Cup and for ESPN in Euro 2008. Gray also provides betting tips for Betfair, and also provided commentary for the EA Sports&#x27;s &quot;FIFA&quot; of video games along with John Motson and Des Lynam in &quot;&quot; (being replaced with Mark Lawrenson in the following game) and Clive Tyldesley and Martin Tyler from &quot;FIFA 06&quot; to &quot;FIFA 11&quot;, until being replaced in &quot;FIFA 12&quot; by Sky Sports pundit Alan Smith.

In January 2011, Gray was forced to apologise for comments he made about a female assistant referee, Sian Massey, in a Premier League match. Believing that his microphone was switched off, Gray commented to co-host Richard Keys: &quot;Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don&#x27;t know the offside rule.&quot; Keys replied: &quot;Course they don&#x27;t.&quot; The comments were criticised by Sky Sports, football fans and the Football Association. On 24 January it was announced that both Gray and Keys would be banned for one game. On 25 January 2011, it was announced his contract was being terminated for unacceptable behaviour. Barney Francis, Sky Sports&#x27; managing director, said Gray was dismissed &quot;in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour in an off-air incident that took place in December 2010&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that the Sky statement refers directly to a clip of Gray and Charlotte Jackson in rehearsals for the Sky Sports Christmas Special. While Jackson is attaching a microphone pack, Gray lifts his belt and says: &quot;Charlotte, can you tuck this down here for me?&quot;

In late 2011 Keys and Gray appeared in &quot;Smash It!&quot;, a show designed for the corporate hospitality circuit. The title of the show came from sexual remarks that Keys had made to Jamie Redknapp. An earlier theatre tour in 2011 had to be cancelled due to poor ticket sales. 
He previously presented a Friday evening talkSPORT show with sidekick Richard Keys.

Since June 2013, Andy Gray, alongside Richard Keys, has been presenting the Premier League football coverage on beIN Sports.

Gray&#x27;s former teammate at Everton Peter Reid suggested that Gray&#x27;s dismissal may have been connected to a legal battle between Gray and the former title &quot;News of the World&quot; (both it and Sky were owned by News Corporation at the time) over phone-tapping.

On 25 January 2014, Gray returned to commentating on British television on BT Sport for an FA Cup match between Stevenage and Everton. His appearance occurred three years to the day since his dismissal by Sky. He then commentated alongside Darren Fletcher for the Arsenal v Liverpool match in the next round.

==Personal life==
Gray has five children.

Gray is a supporter of former clubs Rangers FC and Everton FC.

<doc id="988207" wikidata="Q6007326" url="?curid=988207" title="Implied authority">
<text>Implied Authority to contract is a legal term in contract law referring to the implied ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract on behalf of an organization by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. For example, a person carries implied authority when they are wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the logo or trademark of a business or organization, or when they are functioning in an authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization. An implied authority is authority that is not expressly granted by the contract, but that is assumed by the agent in order to have the ability to transact insurance business on behalf of the principal, regardless of what the contract specifically states.

Besides implied authority, there is apparent authority and express authority may apply, these three being known as The Agency Relationship. In relation to companies, apparent authority is usually referred to as &quot;ostensible authority&quot;.

==India==
Section 186 of the Indian Contract Act 1872 provides that an agent&#x27;s authority may be express or implied. Section 187 adds that &quot;An authority is said to be express when it is given by words, spoken or written. An authority is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the case; and things spoken or written or the ordinary course of dealing, may be accounted circumstances of the case&quot;. The Act also includes an &quot;illustration&quot; of how this section operates:

<doc id="988208" wikidata="Q1377272" url="?curid=988208" title="Eskimo kiss">
<text>An Eskimo kiss, nose kiss, or nose rub is a gesture of affection where one rubs the tip of one&#x27;s nose against another person&#x27;s face. In Inuit culture, the gesture is known as a kunik, and consists of pressing or rubbing the tip of one&#x27;s nose against another&#x27;s cheek. In non-Inuit English-speaking culture, two people Eskimo kiss by rubbing the tips of their noses together. Nose-to-cheek kisses are found in other cultures as well.

==History==

When early Western explorers of the Arctic first witnessed Inuit nose rubbing as a greeting behavior, they dubbed it &quot;Eskimo kissing&quot;. The practice was also prevalent in nearby non-Inuit cultures.

==In Inuit culture==

Among the Inuit, &quot;kunik&quot; is a form of expressing affection, usually between family members and loved ones or to young children, that involves pressing the nose and upper lip against the skin (commonly of the cheeks or forehead) and breathing in, causing the loved one&#x27;s skin or hair to be suctioned against the nose and upper lip. A common misconception is that the practice arose so that Inuit could kiss without their mouths freezing together. Rather, it is a non-erotic but intimate greeting used by people who, when they meet outside, often have little except their nose and eyes exposed.

The greeting was described in reports of Kerlungner and Wearner, part of a group of Alaskan Native people touring the United States with entrepreneur Miner W. Bruce in the 1890s: &quot;Mr. Bruce yesterday instructed Kerlungner and Wearner that in this country they should not rub noses, and to close the lesson the two young women kissed each other in the new style for a beginning, both seeming to fear that they looked silly as they did it.&quot;

==In other cultures==

Other peoples use similar greeting practices, notably the Māori of New Zealand and Hawaiians, who practice the &quot;hongi&quot; and &quot;honi&quot; greetings, respectively. Mongolian nomads of the Gobi Desert have a similar practice, as do certain Southeast Asian cultures, such as the Bengalis, Khmer people, Lao people, Thai people, Vietnamese people, Timor, Savu people, Sumba people and Iban people. Nose kissing is also employed as a traditional greeting by Arab tribesmen when greeting members of the same tribe.

<doc id="988213" wikidata="Q6974803" url="?curid=988213" title="National Party (UK, 1976)">
<text>The National Party of the United Kingdom (NP) was a short-lived splinter party from the British National Front (NF). It was formed on 6 January 1976, and was dissolved in 1984.

==Background and formation==
The origins of the party were the result of internal dissention within the Monday Club over &quot;entry to the EEC and immigration&quot; which led to &quot;several leading Powellites&quot; leaving the Conservative Party for the NF, and of later ideological disagreements within the National Front.

John Kingsley Read became leader of the NF in 1974, but faced resistance from John Tyndall and his supporters for his &#x27;populist&#x27; approach. The electoral results from the General Election in 1974 showed the three most successful NF candidates &quot;were all from the &#x27;Populist&#x27; wing&quot;. With Tyndall proposing constitutional reform of the NF the Populist counter-moves to expel him ended in failure. Tyndall went to court which resulted in the reinstatement of &quot;Tyndall and his supporters. Subsequently, the courts also restored the NF headquarters and the membership lists to the Tyndall faction&quot;.

Kingsley Read broke from the NF altogether and formed the NP with several other leading NF members. In all over 2000 members, or one quarter of the NF&#x27;s total membership, joined the new party, which thus represented a considerable loss of support to the NF. At its inaugural meeting the party narrowly voted not to purge the party of &quot;all those with Nazi, Fascist or Communist backgrounds&quot;.

==Development of the party==
Richard Lawson helped shape the ideology of the party the source of which was &quot;the &#x27;soft&#x27; National Socialism of Rohm and the SD&quot;. Lawson edited the party journal, &quot;Britain First&quot;, which was published between 1974 and 1977. As well as Powellite Conservatives and NF Populists a number of members were &quot;socially radical Strasserites&quot;. The National Party &quot;claimed to be more opposed to immigration than the NF&quot; and sought the &quot;repatriation or resettlement abroad of all coloured and other racial incompatible immigrants, their dependents and descendents&quot;. The National Party also circulated Holocaust denial material such as Arthur Butz&#x27;s &quot;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

In the local elections of 1976 it had two councillors elected in Blackburn, Lancashire, These were the last electoral successes for any British far-right party until the election of Derek Beackon of the British National Party in 1993. However, the party went into decline during 1977.
Some members, such as Steve Brady, later rejoined the NF, and other members appear to have joined the Nationalist Party.

A Granada TV &quot;World in Action&quot; investigative documentary in 1976 exposed the pro-Nazi views of Kingsley Read and others despite the fact that one of the reasons Kingsley Read had left the National Front was because of the neo-Nazi backgrounds of some of its members. Kingsley Read later recanted his far right views and re-joined the Conservative Party. &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine claimed that he had given them the entire membership list of the party.

In 1979, Andrew Fountaine lead a similar breakaway movement in contempt of the Nazi connections of the National Front, called the Constitutional Movement. However, after little electoral success, it disbanded in 1984.

==Leading members==
The NP attracted a number of leading figures from the NF/far right to its ranks. These included:
* Gordon Brown of the Greater Britain Movement 
* Richard Lawson, editor of &quot;Britain First&quot; and later associated with the Official National Front and a leading exponent of British folk music.
* David McCalden, a former NF writer who later emigrated to the United States where he became a co-founder of a Holocaust denial organization the Institute for Historical Review.
* Roy Painter, a Conservative Party member from Enfield.
* Denis Pirie, a veteran of the National Socialist Movement, though he later distanced himself from his extremist past.

Other members of note included
* Steve Brady, an influential figure in Loyalist circles in Northern Ireland, a member of the Orange Order, and mainstay of the far right. 
* Richard &quot;Jock&quot; Spooner, who emigrated to Australia where he became a leading activist in the One Nation Party.
* Robert Hallman, leader of the Blackburn branch of the NP. Hallman stood unsuccessfully for a By-election on Blackburn council in 1976. He was later arrested for possession of a firearm.
* John Frankman, was elected to Blackburn council alongside Kingsley Read at the 1976 United Kingdom local elections. He was forced to resign as a councillor after it emerged he had had a suspended prison sentence for driving without insurance.

==National Party elections==
Given that its brief history mainly fell between two general elections the NP only contested three by-elections for Westminster seats. In each of the three elections the NPUK finished behind the NF candidates, namely Andrew Fountaine, Joseph Parker and Paul Kavanagh respectively.

<text>The East African campaign (also known as the Abyssinian campaign) was fought in East Africa during the Second World War by Allies of World War II, mainly from the British Empire, against Italy and its colony of Italian East Africa, between June 1940 and November 1941. The British Middle East Command with troops from the United Kingdom, South Africa, British India, Uganda Protectorate, Kenya, Somaliland, West Africa, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Sudan and Nyasaland participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied of Belgian Congo, Imperial Ethiopian Arbegnoch (resistance forces) and a small unit of Free French Forces.

Italian East Africa was defended by the (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the (Royal Army), (Royal Air Force) and (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and NCOs. With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.

On 13 June 1940, an Italian air raid took place on the RAF base at Wajir in Kenya and the air war continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the Western Desert campaign.

==Background==

===Italian East Africa===

On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed the formation of Italian East Africa (&quot;Africa Orientale Italiana&quot;, AOI), from Ethiopia after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the colonies of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during the Second World War but the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion but the Italian General Staff had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of Africa.


Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, was appointed Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI in November 1937, with a headquarters in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel). By 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to On 10 June, the Italian army was organised in three corps and one division commands,
* Northern Sector, in Asmara, Lieutenant General Luigi Frusci (Italian Eritrea)
* Southern Sector, in Jimma, General Pietro Gazzera
* Eastern Sector, in Addis Ababa, General Guglielmo Nasi
* Giuba Sector, in Mogadishu, Lieutenant General Carlo De Simone (Southern Italian Somaliland)

Aosta had two metropolitan divisions, the 40th Infantry Division &quot;Cacciatori d&#x27;Africa&quot; and the 65th Infantry Division &quot;Granatieri di Savoia&quot;, the Alpini Battalion &quot;Uork Amba&quot; of the 7th Alpini Regiment (elite mountain troops), a battalion of motorised infantry, several Blackshirt battalions and smaller units. About 70 per cent of Italian troops were locally recruited Askari. The regular Eritrean battalions and the (RCTC Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry (Falcon Feathers). (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali Dubats from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with &quot;Shifta&quot;, marauders who plundered and murdered at will.

Once Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company was formed from German residents of East Africa and stranded German sailors. Italian forces in East Africa were equipped with about machine-guns, 24 M11/39 medium tanks, 39 L3/35 tankettes, and twenty-four anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one and The Italians had little opportunity for reinforcement or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition. On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German merchant raiders in the Indian Ocean were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. On 22 November 1940 the Yugoslav steamer &quot;Durmitor&quot;, captured by the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Atlantis&quot;, put in at Warsheikh with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.

The (CAAOI) of the (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts,
* (Air Sector Headquarters North)
* (Air Sector Headquarters West)
* (Air Sector Headquarters South)
In June 1940, there were in the AOI, in squadrons with comprising with six aircraft each, six Caproni Ca.133 light bomber squadrons, seven Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 squadrons and two squadrons of Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s. Four fighter squadrons had , comprising two nine-aircraft Fiat CR.32 squadrons and two nine-aircraft Fiat CR.42 Falco squadrons; CAAOI had one reconnaissance squadron with nine IMAM Ro.37 aircraft. There were aircraft and another reserve, of which operational and unserviceable.

On the outbreak of war, the CAAOI had of aviation fuel, of bombs and of ammunition. Aircraft and engine maintenance was conducted at the main air bases and at the Caproni and Piaggio workshops, which could repair about fifteen seriously-damaged aircraft and engines each month, along with some moderately and lightly damaged aircraft and could also recycle scarce materials. The Italians had reserves for 75 per cent of their front-line strength but lacked spare parts and many aircraft were cannibalised to keep others operational. The quality of the units varied. The SM.79 was the only modern bomber and the CR.32 fighter was obsolete but the in East Africa had a cadre of highly experienced Spanish Civil War veterans. There was the nucleus of a transport fleet, with nine Savoia-Marchetti S.73, nine Ca.133, six Ca.148 (a lengthened version of the Ca.133) and a Fokker F.VII, which maintained internal communications and carried urgent items and personnel between sectors.

From 1935 to 1940 the (Italian Royal Navy) laid plans for an ocean-going &quot;escape fleet&quot; () equipped for service in the tropics. The plans varied from three battleships, an aircraft carrier, twelve cruisers, 36 destroyers and 30 submarines to a more realistic two cruisers, eight destroyers and twelve submarines. Even the lower establishment proved too expensive and in 1940 the Red Sea Flotilla had seven older fleet destroyers, the 5th Destroyer Division with the Leone-class destroyers , and and the 3rd Destroyer Division with the Sauro-class torpedo boats (a class of ships between the size of small, fast motor torpedo boats and destroyers, not found in the Royal Navy) , , and . There were &quot;Orsini&quot; and &quot;Acerbi&quot; two old local defence torpedo boats and a squadron of five first world war (MAS, motor torpedo boats).

The Flotilla had eight modern submarines (&quot;Archimede&quot;, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot;, &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot;, , &quot;Galvani&quot;, &quot;Guglielmotti&quot;, Macallé and &quot;Perla&quot;). The flotilla was based at Massawa in Eritrea on the Red Sea. The port linked Axis-occupied Europe and the naval facilities in the Italian concession zone at Tientsin in China. There were limited port facilities at Assab, in Eritrea and at Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea. The finite resources in Italian East Africa were intended to last for a war of about six months&#x27; duration, the submarines denying the Red Sea route to the British.

===Mediterranean and Middle East===
The British had based forces in Egypt since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. A small British and Commonwealth force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, over the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres. Wavell was responsible for the defence of Egypt through the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Troops Egypt, to train the Egyptian Army and co-ordinate military operations with the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, Vice-Admiral Ralph Leatham, the Commander-in-Chief India, General Robert Cassels, the Inspector General, African Colonial Forces, Major-General Douglas Dickinson and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East, Air Chief Marshal William Mitchell. (French divisions in Tunisia faced the Italian 5th Army on the western Libyan border, until the Franco-Axis Armistice of 22 June 1940.) In Libya, the &quot;Regio Esercito Italiana&quot; (Royal Italian Army) had about and in Egypt, the British had about with another training in Palestine. Wavell had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa.

===Middle East Command===
Middle East Command was established before the war to control land operations and co-ordinate with the naval and air commands in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Wavell was allowed only five staff officers for plans and command of an area of . From 1940 to 1941, operations took place in the Western Desert of Egypt, East Africa, Greece and the Middle East. In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then to dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany through eastern and south-eastern Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal. In August, Wavell ordered for plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. He specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities. He expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war, Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops. Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to mobilise discreetly for military operations in western Egypt but after the June debacle in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.

After Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Winston Churchill blamed Wavell for a &quot;static policy&quot;. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie at Khartoum. Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Selassie, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts (an advisor to Churchill), Wavell, Lieutenant-General William Platt and Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including support for Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed. In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the Government Code and Cypher School (GC &amp; CS) at Bletchley Park broke the high grade cypher of the Italian Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).

In September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season had ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and the vicinity; on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. In early November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia. The three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the Western Desert campaign and re-open the land route from Cape Town to Cairo.

====East Africa Force====
On 10 June 1940, East Africa Force (Major-General Douglas Dickinson) was established for North-East Africa, East Africa and British Central Africa. In Sudan about and guarded a frontier with the AOI. Platt had 21 companies (4,500 men) of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF) of which five (later six) were organised as motor machine-gun companies. There was no artillery, but the Sudan Horse was converting to a 3.7-inch mountain howitzer battery. The 1st Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, 1st Battalion Essex Regiment and the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, were, in mid-September, incorporated into the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and 9th Indian Infantry Brigade respectively of the 5th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Lewis Heath) when it arrived.

The 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse) was transferred from Egypt in December. The British had an assortment of armoured cars and B Squadron 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4th RTR) with Matilda infantry tanks joined the 4th Indian Division in January 1941. On the outbreak of hostilities, Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater in British Somaliland had about comprising the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) and a battalion of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment. By August, the 1/2nd Punjab and 3/5th Punjab regiments had been transferred from Aden and the 2nd Battalion of the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) with the 1st East African Light Battery (3.7-inch howitzers) came from Kenya, raising the total to in the first week of August. In the Aden Protectorate, British Forces Aden (Air Vice-Marshal George Reid) had a garrison of the two Indian infantry battalions until they were transferred to British Somaliland in August.

In August 1939, Wavell had ordered a covert plan to encourage the rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians had never been able to repress. In September, Colonel Daniel Sandford arrived to run the project, but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the government&#x27;s policy of appeasement. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance. In June 1940, Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to recapture Ethiopia, despite Platt&#x27;s reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahir Dar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debre Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; (Amharic for Patriots).

Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford&#x27;s diplomacy. The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, which were raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare to provide leadership cadres and £1 million was set aside to finance operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford, and the RAF managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, which had suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road, and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941.

==Northern front, 1940==

===British Somaliland 1940===
On 3 August 1940, the Italians invaded with two colonial brigades, four cavalry squadrons, tanks and L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, batteries, pack artillery and air support. The British had a garrison of two companies of the Sudan Defence Force, two motor machine-gun companies and a mounted infantry company. Kassala was bombed and then attacked, the British retiring slowly. On 4 August, the Italians advanced with a western column towards Zeila, a central column (Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone) towards Hargeisa and an eastern column towards Odweina in the south. The SCC skirmished with the advancing Italians as the main British force slowly retired. On 5 August, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were captured, cutting off the British from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns joined. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen was diverted to Berbera, en route to Kenya to take command as reinforcements increased the British garrison to five battalions. (From 5 to 19 August, RAF squadrons based at Aden flew 184 sorties, dropped of bombs, lost seven aircraft destroyed and ten damaged.)

==== Battle of Tug Argan ====
On 11 August, the Italians began the Battle of Tug Argan (, a dry, sandy riverbed), where the road from Hargeisa crosses the Assa hills and by 14 August, the British were at risk of defeat in detail by the larger Italian force and its greater quantity of artillery. Close to being cut off and with only one battalion left in reserve, Godwin-Austen contacted Henry Maitland Wilson, commander of the British Troops in Egypt in Cairo (Wavell was in London) and received permission to withdraw from the colony. The 2nd Battalion, Black Watch, supported by two companies of the 2nd King&#x27;s African Rifles and parties of the 1st/2nd Punjab Regiment covered the retreat of the British contingent to Berbera.

By on 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden but and the HQ stayed behind until morning before sailing and the Italians entered Berbera on the evening of 19 August. In the final four days, the RAF flew twelve reconnaissance and sorties, with on Italian transport and troop columns; sorties were flown over Berbera. The British suffered casualties of and the Italians suffered fuel and ammunition expenditure and wear and tear on vehicles was difficult to remedy, which forced the Italians to return to the defensive. Churchill criticised Wavell for abandoning the colony without enough fighting but Wavell called it a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers.

===Anglo-Egyptian Sudan===

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a border with the AOI and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at Kassala. The Italians forced the British garrison of of the SDF and some local police to retire after inflicting casualties of and for ten casualties of their own. The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at Gallabat, just over the border from Metemma, about south of Kassala and took the villages of Qaysān, Kurmuk and Dumbode on the Blue Nile. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan owing to a lack of fuel and fortified Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strongpoints, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find little anti-British sentiment among the Sudanese population.

The 5th Indian Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940. The 29th Indian Infantry Brigade were placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade was based south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade (William Slim) were sent to Gedaref, with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of . Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance.

Gallabat fort lay in Sudan and Metemma a short way across the Ethiopian border, beyond the Boundary Khor, a dry riverbed with steep banks covered by long grass. Both places were surrounded by field fortifications and Gallabat was held by a colonial infantry battalion. Metemma had two colonial battalions and a &quot;banda&quot; formation, all under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Castagnola. The 10th Indian Infantry Brigade, a field artillery regiment and B Squadron, 6th RTR with seven Cruiser Mk I (A9) tanks and seven Light Tank Mk VI, attacked Gallabat on 6 November at An RAF contingent of six Wellesley bombers and nine Gloster Gladiator fighters, were thought sufficient to overcome the fighters and believed to be in range. The infantry assembled from Gallabat, whose garrison was unaware that an attack was coming, until the RAF bombed the fort and put the wireless out of action. The field artillery began a simultaneous bombardment; after an hour the gunners changed targets and bombarded Metemma. The previous night, the 4th Battalion 10th Baluch Regiment occupied a hill overlooking the fort as a flank guard. The troops on the hill covered the advance at of the 3rd Royal Garwhal Rifles followed by the tanks. The Indians reached Gallabat and fought hand-to-hand with the 65th Infantry Division &quot;Granatieri di Savoia&quot; and some Eritrean troops in the fort. At the 25th and 77th Colonial battalions counter-attacked and were repulsed but three British tanks were knocked out by mines and six by mechanical failure caused by the rocky ground.

The defenders at Boundary Khor were dug in behind fields of barbed wire and Castagnola had contacted Gondar for air support. Italian bombers and fighters attacked all day, shot down seven Gladiators for a loss of five Fiat CR-42s and destroyed the lorry carrying spare parts for the tanks. The ground was so hard and rocky that there were no trenches and when Italian bombers made their biggest attack, the infantry had no cover. An ammunition lorry was set on fire by burning grass and the sound was taken to be an Italian counter-attack from behind. When a platoon advanced towards the sound with fixed bayonets, some troops thought that they were retreating. Part of the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at the fort broke and ran, taking some of the Gahrwalis with them. Many of the British fugitives mounted their transport and drove off, spreading the panic and some of the runaways reached Doka before being stopped.

The Italian bombers returned next morning and Slim ordered a withdrawal from Gallabat Ridge west to less exposed ground that evening. Sappers from the 21st Field Company remained behind to demolish the remaining buildings and stores in the fort. The artillery bombarded Gallabat and Metemma and set off Italian ammunition dumps full of pyrotechnics. British casualties since 6 November were killed and The brigade patrolled to deny the fort to the Italians and on 9 November, two Baluch companies attacked and held the fort during the day and retired in the evening. During the night an Italian counter-attack was repulsed by artillery-fire and next morning the British re-occupied the fort unopposed. Ambushes were laid and prevented Italian reinforcements from occupying the fort or the hills on the flanks, despite frequent bombing by the .

==Southern front, 1940==

===British East Africa (Kenya)===

On the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, East Africa Force (Lieutenant-General Douglas Dickinson) comprised two East African brigades of the King&#x27;s African Rifles organised as a Northern Brigade and a Southern Brigade with a reconnaissance regiment, a light artillery battery and the 22nd Mountain Battery Royal Indian Artillery (RIA). By March 1940, the KAR strength had reached 883 officers, 1,374 non-commissioned officers and 20,026 African other ranks. Wavell ordered Dickinson to defend Kenya and to pin down as many Italian troops as possible. Dickinson planned to defend Mombasa with the 1st East African Infantry Brigade and to deny a crossing of the Tana River and the fresh water at Wajir with the 2nd East African Infantry Brigade.

Detachments were to be placed at Marsabit, Moyale and at Turkana near Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana), an arc long. The Italians were thought to have troops at Kismayo, Mogadishu, Dolo, Moyale and Yavello, which turned out to be colonial troops and &quot;bande&quot;, with two brigades at Jimma, ready to reinforce Moyale or attack Lake Rudolf and then invade Uganda. By the end of July, the 3rd East African Infantry Brigade and the 6th East African Infantry Brigade had been formed. A Coastal Division and a Northern Frontier District Division had been planned but then the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division were created instead.

On 1 June, the first South African unit arrived at the port of Mombasa in Kenya and by the end of July, the 1st South African Infantry Brigade Group had arrived. On 13 August, the 1st South African Division was formed and by the end of 1940, about 27,000 South Africans were in East Africa, in the 1st South African Division, the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division. Each South African brigade group consisted of three rifle battalions, an armoured car company and signal, engineer and medical units. By July, under the terms of a war contingency plan, the 2nd (West Africa) Infantry Brigade, from the Gold Coast (Ghana) and the 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade from Nigeria, were provided for service in Kenya by the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF). The 1st (West African) Brigade, the two KAR brigades and some South African units, formed the 11th (African) Division. The 12th (African) Division had a similar formation with the 2nd (West African) Brigade.

At dawn on 17 June, the Rhodesians supported a raid by the SDF on the Italian desert outpost of El Wak in Italian Somaliland about north-east of Wajir. The Rhodesians bombed and burnt down thatched mud huts and generally harassed Italian troops. Since the main fighting at that time was against Italian advances towards Moyale in Kenya, the Rhodesians concentrated there. On 1 July, an Italian attack on the border town of Moyale, on the edge of the Ethiopian escarpment, where the tracks towards Wajir and Marsabit meet, was repulsed by a company of the 1st KAR and reinforcements were moved up. The Italians carried out a larger attack by about four battalions on 10 July, after a considerable artillery bombardment and after three days the British withdrew unopposed. The Italians eventually advanced to water holes at Dabel and Buna, nearly inside Kenya but lack of supplies prevented a further advance.

===Italian strategy, December 1940===
After the conquest of British Somaliland the Italians adopted a more defensive posture. In late 1940, Italian forces suffered defeats in the Mediterranean Campaign, the Operation Compass in the Western Desert, the Battle of Britain and in the Greco-Italian War. This prompted General Ugo Cavallero, the new Italian Chief of the Chief of the General Staff in Rome, to adopt a new strategy in East Africa. In December 1940, Cavallero thought that Italian forces in East Africa should abandon offensive actions against the Sudan and the Suez Canal and concentrate on the defence of the AOI. After Cavallero and Aosta requested permission to withdraw from the Sudanese frontier, the army high command in Rome ordered Italian forces in East Africa to withdraw to better defensive positions.

Frusci was ordered to withdraw from Kassala and Metemma in the lowlands along the Eritrea–Sudan border and hold the mountain passes on the Kassala–Agordat and Metemma–Gondar roads. Frusci chose not to withdraw from the lowlands, because withdrawal would involve too great a loss of prestige and because Kassala was an important railway junction; holding it prevented the British from using the railway to carry supplies from Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast to their base at Gedaref. Information on the Italian withdrawal plan was quickly decrypted by the British and Platt was able to begin his offensive into Eritrea on 18 January 1941, three weeks ahead of schedule.

===War in the air===

In Sudan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Air Headquarters Sudan (Headquarters 203 Group from 17 August, Air Headquarters East Africa from 19 October), subordinate to the AOC-in-C Middle East, had 14 Squadron, 47 Squadron and 223 Squadron (Wellesley bombers). A flight of Vincent biplanes from 47 Squadron performed Army Co-operation duties and were later reinforced from Egypt by 45 squadron (Blenheims). Six Gladiator biplane fighters were based in Port Sudan for trade protection and anti-submarine patrols over the Red Sea, the air defence of Port Sudan, Atbara and Khartoum and for army support.

In May, 1 (Fighter) Squadron South African Air Force (SAAF) arrived, was transferred to Egypt to convert to Gladiators and returned to Khartoum in August. The SAAF in Kenya comprised 12 Squadron (Junkers Ju 86 bombers), 11 Squadron (Battle bombers), 40 Squadron (Hart light bombers), 2 Squadron (Fury fighters) and 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF (Hardy general-purpose aircraft). Better aircraft became available later but the first aircraft were old and slow, the South Africans even pressing an old Valentia biplane into service as a bomber.

The South Africans faced experienced Italian pilots, including a cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans. Despite its lack of experience, 1 Squadron claimed 48 enemy aircraft destroyed and 57 damaged in the skies over East Africa. A further 57 were claimed destroyed on the ground. all for the loss of six pilots. It is thought the unit was guilty of severe over-claiming. From November 1940 to early January 1941, Platt put pressure on the Italians along the Ethiopia–Sudan border with patrols and raids by ground troops and aircraft. Hurricanes and more Gladiators began to replace some of the older models. On 6 December, a large concentration of Italian motor transport was bombed and strafed by Commonwealth aircraft a few miles north of Kassala.

The same aircraft then proceeded to machine-gun from low level the nearby positions of the Italian Blackshirts and colonial infantry. A few days later, the aircraft bombed the Italian base at Keru, fifty miles east of Kassala. The Commonwealth pilots had the satisfaction of seeing supply dumps, stores and transport enveloped in flame and smoke as they flew away. One morning in mid-December, a force of Italian fighters strafed a Rhodesian landing-strip at Wajir near Kassala, where two Hardys were caught on the ground and destroyed; of fuel were set alight and four Africans were killed and eleven injured fighting the fire.

===War at sea, 1940===

The approaches to the Red Sea through the Gulf of Aden and the (Gate of Tears Strait) is wide. With the Italian declaration of war on 10 June and the loss of French naval support in the Mediterranean after the Armistice of 22 June, the -long Red Sea passage to Suez became the main British sea route to the Middle East. South of Suez the British-held Port Sudan, about halfway down on the Sudan coast and the base at Aden, east of Bab-el-Mandeb on the Arabian Peninsula. The principal Italian naval force ( [Rear-Admiral] Mario Bonetti) was based at Massawa in Eritrea, about north of the Bab-el-Mandeb, well placed for the Red Sea Flotilla to attack Allied convoys.

British code-breakers of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park in England, deciphered Italian orders of 19 May, coded using C38m machines, secretly to mobilise the army and air force in East Africa. Merchant traffic was stopped by the British on 24 May, pending the introduction of a convoy system. The Red Sea Force (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Arthur Murray), operational at Aden since April with the light cruisers and HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot; (&quot;Liverpool&quot; was replaced by ), was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser , which sailed south with Convoy BS 4, the 28th Destroyer Flotilla comprising , &quot;Kimberley&quot;, and and three sloops from the Mediterranean. The force was to conduct a blockade Italian East Africa (Operation Begum), attack the Red Sea Flotilla and protect the sea route from Aden to Suez.

On 6 June, the Azio-class minelayer &quot;Ostia&quot; used 470 mines to lay eight barrages off Massawa and the destroyer &quot;Pantera&quot; dropped 110 mines in two barrages off Assab the day after. When Italy declared war on 10 June, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; sailed for French Somaliland (Djibouti), &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; to Aden, &quot;Galvani&quot; to the Gulf of Oman and &quot;Mecallé&quot; to Port Sudan. On 14 June &quot;Torricelli&quot; put to sea to relieve &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; whose crew had been incapacitated by chloromethane poisoning from the refrigeration system. The crew of &quot;Macallé&quot; was also afflicted; the boat was run aground and lost on 15 June. On 18 June, &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; boarded and released the neutral Yugoslav steamship &quot;Dravo&quot; and the next day engaged the armed trawler off Aden. All but one officer was killed by shell-fire and &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; was captured along with many documents including operational orders for four other Italian submarines.

&quot;Archimede&quot;, &quot;Perla&quot; and &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; sailed from 19 to 21 June. On 26 June, &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; ran onto a shoal and suffered severe damage; the wreck was salvaged later. Documents recovered from &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; were used to intercept and damage &quot;Torricelli&quot; on 21 June. The submarine headed for home but was caught off Perim Island and sunk by &quot;Kandahar&quot;, &quot;Kingston&quot;, &quot;Khartoum&quot; and the sloop . Several hours afterwards, a torpedo on &quot;Khartoum&quot;, damaged by a shell from &quot;Torricelli&quot;, exploded and caused an uncontrollable fire. &quot;Khartoum&quot; tried to reach Perim Harbour about distant but the crew and prisoners had to abandon ship; later a magazine explosion wrecked the vessel. The sloop &quot;Falmouth&quot; exploited the document find from &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; to sink &quot;Galvani&quot; in the Gulf of Oman on 24 June. On 13 August, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; made an abortive attempt to intercept the battleship en route from Suez to Aden.
From 13 to 19 August &quot;Kimberley&quot; and the sloop bombarded Italian troops advancing west of Berbera in British Somaliland. Italian air raids on Berbera caused splinter damage to &quot;Hobart&quot; as it participated in the evacuation of Berbera with &quot;Carlisle&quot;, &quot;Ceres&quot;, &quot;Kandahar&quot;, &quot;Kimberley&quot; and the sloops &quot;Shoreham&quot;, , &quot;Auckland&quot;, auxiliary cruisers &quot;Chakdina&quot;, &quot;Chantala&quot; and &quot;Laomédon&quot;, the transport and the hospital ship , lifting 5,960 troops, 1,266 civilians and 184 sick and wounded. On 18 November the cruiser bombarded Zante in Italian Somaliland British naval forces supported land operations and blockaded the remnants the Red Sea Flotilla at Massawa. By the end of 1940, the British had gained control of East African coastal routes and the Red Sea; Italian forces in the AOI declined as fuel, spare parts and supplies from Italy ran out. There were six Italian air attacks on convoys in October and none after 4 November.

====Red Sea convoys====
During 16 June 1940, &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; sank the Norwegian tanker &quot;James Stove&quot; (8,215 gross register tons [GRT]), sailing independently about south of Aden. On 2 July the first of the BN convoys (Bombay Northward; Bombay to Suez, then Aden to Suez 1940–1941), comprising six tankers and three freighters, assembled in the Gulf of Aden. Italian sorties against the BN–BS convoys (Bombay Southward; Suez to Aden, late 1940 to early 1941) were dispiriting failures; from 26 to 31 July, &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; failed to find two Greek merchantmen and a sortie by the torpedo boats &quot;Cesare Battisti&quot; and &quot;Francesco Nullo&quot; was also abortive. &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; from 21 to 25 August, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; (25–31 August), &quot;Francesco Nullo&quot; and &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; from 24 to 25 August and the destroyers &quot;Pantera&quot; and &quot;Tigre&quot; (28–29 August) failed to find Greek ships in the Red Sea, despite agent reports and sightings by air reconnaissance. Italian aircraft and submarines had little more success.

On the night of 5/6 September, &quot;Cesare Battisti&quot;, &quot;Daniele Manin&quot; and &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; sailed, followed on 6/7 September by the destroyers &quot;Leone&quot; and &quot;Tigre&quot; to attack a northbound convoy (BN 4) found by air reconnaissance but found nothing. Further to the north, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; and &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; also failed to find BN 4 but &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; torpedoed the Greek tanker &quot;Atlas&quot; (4,008 GRT) south of the Farasan Islands straggling behind the convoy. &quot;Leone&quot;, &quot;Pantera&quot;, &quot;Cesare Battisti&quot; and &quot;Daniele Manin&quot; with the submarines &quot;Archimede&quot; and &quot;Gugliemotti&quot; failed to find a convoy of 23 ships spotted by air reconnaissance. &quot;Bhima&quot; (5,280 GRT) in convoy BN 5 was damaged by bombs and one man killed; the ship was towed to Aden and beached. In August the British ran four convoys in each direction, five in September and seven in October, 86 ships in BN convoys and 72 in BS (southbound) convoys; the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; managed only six air attacks in October and none after 4 November.

The Attack on Convoy BN 7, took place from 20 to 21 October and was the only destroyer attack on a convoy, despite gaining precise information on BN convoys as they passed French Somaliland. The 31 ships of BN 7 were escorted by the cruiser &quot;Leander&quot;, the destroyer , the sloops &quot;Auckland&quot;, and with the minesweepers and , with air cover from Aden. &quot;Guglielmo Marconi&quot; and &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot;, stationed to the north, failed to intercept the convoy but on 21 October the destroyers &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; and &quot;Francesco Nullo&quot; with the destroyers &quot;Pantera&quot;, &quot;Leone&quot; attacked the convoy east of Massawa; the attackers caused only superficial damage to one ship.

&quot;Kimberley&quot; forced &quot;Francesco Nullo&quot; aground on an island near Massawa, at the Action off Harmil Island on the morning of 21 October. &quot;Kimberley&quot; was hit in the engine room by a shore battery and had to be towed to Port Sudan by &quot;Leander&quot;. The wreck of &quot;Francesco Nullo&quot; was bombed on 21 October by three Blenheims of 45 Squadron. From 22 to 28 November, &quot;Archimede&quot; and &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; sailed to investigate reports of a convoy but found nothing, as did &quot;Tigre&quot;, &quot;Leone&quot;, &quot;Daniele Manin&quot;, &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; and &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; from 3 to 5 December. From 12 to 22 December &quot;Archimede&quot; sailed twice after ship sightings but both sorties came to nothing; &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot; sortied off Port Sudan. from June to December the RAF had escorted 54 BN and BS convoys from which one ship was sunk and one damaged by Italian aircraft.

===French Somaliland 1940–1942===
The governor of French Somaliland (now Djibouti), Brigadier-General Paul Legentilhomme had a garrison of seven battalions of Senegalese and Somali infantry, three batteries of field guns, four batteries of anti-aircraft guns, a company of light tanks, four companies of militia and irregulars, two platoons of the camel corps and an assortment of aircraft. After visiting from 8 to 13 January 1940, Wavell decided that Legentilhomme would command the military forces in both Somalilands should war with Italy come. In June, an Italian force was assembled to capture the port city of Djibouti, the main military base.

After the fall of France in June, the neutralisation of Vichy French colonies allowed the Italians to concentrate on the more lightly defended British Somaliland. On 23 July, Legentilhomme was ousted by the pro-Vichy naval officer Pierre Nouailhetas and left on 5 August for Aden, to join the Free French. In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to &quot;rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed&quot;. The Free French were to arrange a &quot;voluntary ralliement&quot; by propaganda (Operation Marie) and the British were to blockade the colony. Wavell considered that if British pressure was applied, a rally would appear to have been coerced. Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control.

When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiating with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March.

==Northern front, 1941==
===Operation Camilla===

Operation Camilla was a deception concocted by Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke to deceive the Italians, making them believe that the British planned to re-conquer British Somaliland with the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, transferred from Egypt to Gedaref and Port Sudan. In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland.

&quot;Sibs&quot; (, hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 to mature early in January 1941. The deception was a success but the plot backfired when the Italians began to evacuate British Somaliland instead of sending reinforcements. Troops were sent north into Eritrea, where the real attack was coming, instead of to the east. Part of the deception, with misleading wireless transmissions, did convince the Italians that two Australian divisions were in Kenya, which led the Italians to reinforce the wrong area.

===Eritrea===
In November 1940, Gazelle Force operated from the Gash river delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, where hill ranges from bound wide valleys and the rainfall makes the area malarial from July to October. On 11 December, Wavell ordered the 4th Indian Division to withdraw from Operation Compass in the Western Desert and move to Sudan. The transfer took until early January 1941 and Platt intended to begin the offensive on the northern front on 8 February, with a pincer attack on Kassala, by the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, less a brigade each.

News of the Italian disaster in Egypt, the harassment by Gazelle Force and the activities of Mission 101 in Ethiopia, led to the Italians withdrawing their northern flank to Keru and Wachai and then on 18 January to retreat hurriedly from Kassala and Tessenei, the triangle of Keru, Biscia and Aicota. Wavell had ordered Platt to advance the offensive from March to 9 February and then to 19 January, when it seemed that Italian morale was crumbling. The withdrawal led Wavell to order a pursuit and the troops arriving at Port Sudan (Briggs Force) to attack at Karora and advance parallel to the coast, to meet the forces coming from the west.

====Battle of Agordat, Barentu====
Two roads joined at Agordat and went through to Keren, the only route to Asmara. The 4th Indian Division was sent along the road to Sabderat and Wachai, thence as far towards Keru as supplies allowed, with the Matilda Infantry tanks of B Squadron, 4th RTR to join from Egypt. The 5th Indian Division was to capture Aicota, ready to move east to Barentu or north-east to Biscia. Apart from air attacks the pursuit was not opposed until Keru Gorge, held by a rearguard of the 41st Colonial Brigade. The brigade retreated on the night of leaving General Ugo Fongoli, his staff and behind as prisoners. On 28 January, the 3/14th Punjab Regiment made a flanking move to Mt Cochen to the south and on 30 January, five Italian colonial battalions counter-attacked with mountain artillery support, forcing back the Indians.

On the morning of 31 January the Indians attacked again and advanced towards the main road. The 5th Indian Brigade on the plain attacked with the Matildas, overran the Italians, knocked out several Italian tanks and cut the road to Keren. The 2nd Colonial Division retreated having lost 1,500 to 2,000 infantry, and several medium and light tanks. Barentu, held by nine battalions of the 2nd Colonial Division (about and about thirty-six dug in M11/39 tanks and armoured cars was attacked by 10th Indian Infantry Brigade from the north against a determined Italian defence, as the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade advanced from the west, slowed by demolitions and rearguards. On the night of 31 January/1 February, the Italians retreated along a track towards Tole and Arresa and on 8 February, abandoned vehicles were found by the pursuers. The Italians had taken to the hills, leaving the Tessenei–Agordat road open.

====Battle of Keren====
On 12 January, Aosta had sent a regiment of the 65th Infantry Division &quot;Granatieri di Savoia&quot; (General Amedeo Liberati) and three colonial brigades to Keren. The 4th and 5th Indian Infantry Divisions advanced eastwards from Agordat into the rolling countryside, which gradually increased in elevation towards the Keren Plateau, through the Ascidira Valley. There was an escarpment on the left and a spur rising to on the right of the road and the Italians were dug in on heights which dominated the massifs, ravines and mountains. The defensive positions had been surveyed before the war and chosen as the main defensive position to guard Asmara and the Eritrean highlands from an invasion from Sudan. On 15 March, after several days of bombing, the 4th Indian Division attacked on the north and west side of the road to capture ground on the left flank, ready for the 5th Indian Division to attack on the east side.

The Indians met a determined defence and made limited progress but during the night the 5th Indian Division captured Fort Dologorodoc, above the valley. The &quot;Granatieri di Savoia&quot; and &quot;Alpini&quot; counter-attacked Dologorodoc seven times from 18 to 22 March but the attacks were costly failures. Wavell flew to Keren to assess the situation and on 15 March, watched with Platt as the Indians made a frontal attack up the road, ignoring the high ground on either side and breaking through. Early on 27 March, Keren was captured after a battle lasting 53 days, for a British and Commonwealth loss of killed and Italian losses were and 9,000 Ascari killed and about 21,000 wounded. The Italians conducted a fighting withdrawal under air attack to Ad Teclesan, in a narrow valley on the Keren–Asmara road, the last defensible position before Asmara. The defeat at Keren had shattered the morale of the Italian forces and when the British attacked early on 31 March, the position fell and prisoners and were taken; Asmara was declared an open town the next day and the British entered unopposed.

===Massawa===

Admiral Mario Bonetti, the commander of the Italian Red Sea Flotilla and the garrison at Massawa, had and about to defend the port. During the evening of 31 March, three of the last six destroyers at Massawa put to sea to raid the Gulf of Suez and then scuttle themselves. &quot;Leone&quot; ran aground and sank the next morning; the sortie was postponed and on 2 April the last five destroyers left to attack Port Sudan and then sink themselves. Heath telephoned Bonetti with an ultimatum to surrender and not block the harbour by scuttling ships. If this was refused, the British would leave Italian citizens in Eritrea and Ethiopia to fend for themselves. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group sent small forces towards Adowa and Adigrat and the rest advanced down the Massawa road, which declined by in . The Indians rendezvoused at Massawa with Briggs Force by 5 April, after it had cut across country.

Bonetti was once again called upon to surrender but refused and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed by the Massawa garrison. A simultaneous attack on the west side by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron, 4th RTR, broke through. The Free French overran the defences in the south-west as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. In the afternoon, Bonetti surrendered and the Allied force took and The harbour was found to have been blocked by the scuttling of two large floating dry docks, ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north Naval Harbour, the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa–Asmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port had come into use to supply the 5th Indian Infantry Division. The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the British strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea. On 11 April, the US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, rescinded the status, under the Neutrality Acts, of the Red Sea as a combat zone, freeing US ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East.

===Western Ethiopia, 1941===

Gideon Force was a small British and African special forces unit, which acted as a &quot;Corps d&#x27;Elite&quot; amongst the Sudan Defence Force, Ethiopian regular forces and &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; (Patriots). At its peak, Orde Wingate led fifty officers, twenty British NCOs, Sudanese troops and trained Ethiopian regulars. He had a few mortars, no artillery and no air support, only intermittent bombing sorties. The force operated in the difficult country of Gojjam Province at the end of a long and tenuous supply-line, on which nearly all of its perished. Gideon Force and the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; (Ethiopian Patriots) ejected the Italian forces under General Guglielmo Nasi, the conqueror of British Somaliland in six weeks and captured and troops, twelve guns, many machine-guns, rifles and ammunition and over animals. Gideon Force was disbanded on 1 June 1941, Wingate was returned to his substantive rank of Major and returned to Egypt, as did many of the troops of Gideon Force, who joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) of the Eighth Army.

====Addis Ababa====

While Debre Markos and Addis Derra were being captured, other Ethiopian Patriots under &quot;Ras&quot; Abebe Aregai consolidated themselves around Addis Ababa in preparation for Emperor Selassie&#x27;s return. In response to the rapidly advancing British and Commonwealth forces and to the general uprising of Ethiopian Patriots, the Italians in Ethiopia retreated to the mountain fortresses of Gondar, Amba Alagi, Dessie and Gimma. After negotiations prompted by Wavell, Aosta ordered the governor, Agenore Frangipani, to surrender the city to forestall a massacre of Italian civilians, as had occurred in Dire Dawa. Ashamed of not being allowed by his superior to fight to the death in the old style, Frangipani killed himself with poison the next day.

On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by Harry Wetherall, Dan Pienaar and Charles Christopher Fowkes escorted by East African armoured cars, who received the surrender of the city. The (Police of Italian Africa) stayed in the city to maintain order. Selassie made a formal entry to the city on 5 May. On 13 April, Cunningham sent a force led by Pienaar comprising 1st South African Brigade and Campbell&#x27;s Scouts (Ethiopian irregulars led by a British officer), to continue the northward advance and join with Platt&#x27;s forces advancing south.

On 20 April, the South Africans captured Dessie on the main road north from Addis Ababa to Asmara, about south of Amba Alagi. In eight weeks the British had advanced from Tana to Mogadishu at a cost of 501 casualties and eight aircraft and had destroyed the bulk of the Italian air and land forces. From Debra Marqos, Wingate pursued the Italians and undertook a series of harrying actions. (In early May most of Gideon Force had to break off to provide a suitable escort for Hailie Selassie&#x27;s formal entry into Addis Ababa.) By 18 May, Maraventano was dug in at Agibor, against a force of about including only soldiers ( the Frontier Battalion and the re-formed 2nd Ethiopian Battalion).

Both sides were short of food, ammunition, water and medical supplies; Wingate attempted a ruse by sending a message to Maraventano telling of reinforcements due to arrive and that the imminent withdrawal of British troops would leave the Italian column at the mercy of the Patriots. Maraventano discussed the situation with the Italian headquarters in Gondar on 21 May and was given discretion to surrender, which took place on 23 May by and troops, and children and men and camp followers. Gideon Force was down to soldiers to make the formal guard of honour at the surrender, the rest being Patriots.

==Southern front, 1941==
===Italian Somaliland===

In January 1941, the Italians decided that the plains of Italian Somalia could not be defended. The 102nd &quot;Divisione Somala&quot; (General Adriano Santini) and &quot;bande&quot; (about retired to the lower Jubba River and the 101st &quot;Divisione Somala&quot; (General Italo Carnevali) and &quot;bande&quot; (about to the upper Juba on the better defensive terrain of the mountains of Ethiopia. He encountered few Italians west of the Juba, only &quot;bande&quot; and a colonial battalion at Afmadu and troops at Kismayo, where the Juba River empties into the Indian Ocean. Against an expected six brigades and &quot;six groups of native levies&quot; holding the Juba for the Italians, Cunningham began Operation Canvas on 24 January, with four brigade groups from the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division. Afmadu was captured on 11 February and three days later, the port of Kismayo the first objective was captured. North of Kismayo and beyond the river was the main Italian position at Jelib. On 22 February, Jelib was attacked on both flanks and from the rear. The Italians were routed and 30,000 were killed, captured or dispersed in the bush. There was nothing to hinder a British advance of to Mogadishu, the capital and main port of Italian Somaliland.

On 25 February 1941, the motorised 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade (11th (African) Division), which had advanced up the coast in three days, occupied the Somali capital of Mogadishu unopposed. The 12th (African) Division was ordered to advance on Bardera and Isha Baidoa but was held up because of the difficulty in using Kismayo as a supply base. The division pushed up the Juba River in Italian Somaliland towards the Ethiopian border town of Dolo. After a pause, caused by the lack of equipment to sweep Mogadishu harbour of British magnetic mines dropped earlier, the 11th (African) Division began a fighting pursuit of the retreating Italian forces north from Mogadishu on 1 March. The division pursued the Italians towards the Ogaden Plateau. By 17 March, the 11th (African) Division completed a 17-day dash along the Italian (Imperial Road) from Mogadishu to Jijiga in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. By early March Cunningham&#x27;s forces had captured most of Italian Somaliland and were advancing through Ethiopia towards the ultimate objective, Addis Ababa. On 26 March, Harar was captured and 572 prisoners taken, with 13 guns, the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade having advanced nearly in 32 days. (On 29 March, Dire Dawa was occupied by South African troops, after Italian colonists appealed for help against deserters, who were committing atrocities.)

===British Somaliland 1941===

The operation to recapture British Somaliland began on 16 March 1941 from Aden, in the first successful Allied landing on a defended shore of the war. The Aden Striking Force of about was to be carried about from Aden by eight navy ships and civilian transports carrying heavy equipment. The troops were to be put ashore onto beaches inside reefs to the east and west of Berbera to secure the town and re-conquer the territory. Some doubts were expressed as to the feasibility of negotiating offshore reefs in the dark, when the town behind was blacked out but the risk was taken. On 16 March about north of the town and off shore, the force prepared to land as advanced parties searched for landing places. The 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and 3/15th Punjab Regiment Indian Army (which had been evacuated from the port in August 1940) and a Somali commando detachment, landed at Berbera from Force D (the cruisers and &quot;Caledon&quot;, the destroyers &quot;Kandahar&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot;, auxiliary cruisers &quot;Chakdina&quot; and &quot;Chantala&quot;, Indian trawlers &quot;Netavati&quot; and &quot;Parvati&quot;, two transports and ML 109). When the Sikhs landed, the 70th Colonial Brigade &quot;melted away&quot;. On 20 March, Hargeisa was captured and the next few months were spent mopping up. The Somaliland Camel Corps was re-founded in mid-April, to resume operations against local bandits. British forces advanced westwards into eastern Ethiopia and in late March, linked with forces from the Southern Front around Harar and Dire Dawa. Cunningham&#x27;s forces could now be supplied efficiently through Berbera.

====Amba Alagi====

After the fall of Keren, Aosta retreated to Amba Alagi, an mountain that had been tunnelled for strong points, artillery positions and stores, inside a ring of similarly fortified peaks. British troops advancing from the south had captured Addis Ababa on 6 April. Wavell imposed a policy of avoiding big operations in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, that would impede the withdrawal of troops to Egypt. The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement. The main attack by the 5th Indian Division began on 4 May and made slow progress. On 10 May, the 1st South African Brigade arrived and completed the encirclement of the mountain. The Indian division attacked again on 13 May, with the South Africans attacking next day and forcing the Italians out of several defensive positions. Concerned about the care of his wounded and rumours of atrocities committed by the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot;, Aosta offered to surrender, provided that the Italians were granted the honours of war. On 19 May, Aosta and troops, marched past a guard of honour into captivity.

===Southern Ethiopia===

The East Africa Force on the southern front included the 1st South African Division, the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division (Major-General Reade Godwin-Austen) (The African divisions were composed of East African, South African, Nigerian and Ghanaian troops with British, Rhodesian and South African officers.) In January 1941, Cunningham decided to launch his first attacks across the Kenyan border directly into southern Ethiopia. Although he realised that the approaching wet season would preclude a direct advance this way to Addis Ababa, he hoped that this action would cause the Ethiopians in the south of the country to rise up in rebellion against the Italians (the plot proved abortive). Cunningham sent the 1st South African Division (composed of the 2nd and 5th South African and 21st East African brigades) and an independent East African brigade into the Galla-Sidamo Governorate. From 16 to 18 January 1941, they captured El Yibo and on 19 February, an advance force of the South African Division captured Jumbo. From 24 to 25 January, Cunningham&#x27;s troops fought on the Turbi Road.

The southern Ethiopia attack was stopped in mid-February by heavy rain, which made movement and maintenance of the force very difficult. From 1 February, they captured Gorai and El Gumu. On 2 February, they took Hobok. From 8 to 9 February, Banno was captured. On 15 February, the fighting was on the Yavello Road. The two South African Brigades then launched a double flanking movement on Mega. After a three-day battle in which many of the South Africans, equipped for tropical conditions, suffered from exposure because of the heavy rain and near freezing temperatures, they captured Mega on 18 February. Moyale, south-east of Mega on the border with Kenya, was occupied on 22 February by a patrol of Abyssinian irregular troops which had been attached to the South African Division.

===War at sea, 1941===

The success of Operation Begum in gaining control of the seas off East Africa eased the supply of the British land forces; ships on passage to and from the Mediterranean supplemented the Red Sea Force ships in offshore operations. The German ship sailed from Kismayo in Italian Somaliland on 31 January and rendezvoused from 14 to 17 February with the heavy cruiser &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;, the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Atlantis&quot; and three British ships taken as prizes. The carrier , en route to the Mediterranean to replace , formed Force K with the cruiser and in Operation Breach on 2 February 1941, dispatched Fairey Albacores to mine Mogadishu harbour, bomb the ordnance depot, airfield, the railway station, petrol tanks at Ras Sip and the customs shed. The cruisers , &quot;Ceres&quot; and blockaded Kismayo and in the Red Sea, &quot;Pantera&quot;, &quot;Tigre&quot; and &quot;Leone&quot; based at Massawa in Eritrea made another fruitless sortie.

Leatham formed Force T with the carrier , the cruisers &quot;Shropshire&quot;, &quot;Hawkins&quot;, and &quot;Ceres&quot;, with the destroyer &quot;Kandahar&quot; to support Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland from Kenya. About fifty Italian and German merchant ships had been stranded at Massawa and Kismayo on the outbreak of war and few were seaworthy by the time of the British invasion of the AOI but about twelve ships made the attempt. On the night of 10/11 February, eight Italian and two German ships sailed from Kismayo for Mogadishu or Diego Suarez (now Antsiranana) in Madagascar. Three Italian ships were scuttled in Kismayo on 12 February as British troops reached the vicinity of the port which was captured with the support of &quot;Shropshire&quot; two days later. Five of the Italian ships were spotted by aircraft from &quot;Hermes&quot; and captured by &quot;Hawkins&quot;, the German ship &quot;Uckermark&quot; was scuttled. The German &quot;Askari&quot; and Italian ship &quot;Pensilvania&quot; were seen off Mogadishu and destroyed by bombs and gunfire; two of the Italian ships reached Madagascar.

While delayed by mines in the Suez canal, &quot;Formidable&quot; conducted Operation Composition on the night of 12/13 February, sending 14 Albacores to attack Massawa, half with bombs, half with torpedoes. The attack was disorganised by low cloud, SS &quot;Monacalieri&quot; (5,723 GRT) was sunk but little more was achieved. On 13 February, &quot;Hermes&quot; attacked Kismayo with Fairey Swordfish aircraft and the cruiser &quot;Shropshire&quot; bombarded coastal defences, supply dumps and Italian troops. The Walrus aircraft on &quot;Shropshire&quot; attacked Brava and Italian bombers claimed a near miss on one of the British ships. When Kismayo was captured on 14 February, fifteen of the sixteen Axis merchant ships in the harbour were captured. In the Red Sea, the carrier &quot;Formidable&quot; conducted Composition while en route to Suez; its 14 FAA Albacores attacked Massawa on 13 February and sank the merchant ship &quot;Moncaliere&quot; (5,723 GRT) and inflicted slight damage on other ships
The colonial ship &quot;Eritrea&quot; escaped from Massawa on 18 February and on 21 February, &quot;Formidable&quot; sent seven Albacores to dive-bomb the harbour; four were hit by anti-aircraft fire but all returned. During the night the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Ramb I&quot; (3,667 GRT) and the German &quot;Coburg&quot; (7,400 GRT) departed, followed by &quot;Ramb II&quot; on 22 February. On 27 February, &quot;Ramb I&quot; was caught by &quot;Leander&quot; sunk north of the Maldive Islands; &quot;Eritrea&quot; and &quot;Ramb II&quot; escaped and reached Kobe, Japan. On 25 February, Mogadishu fell and British merchant sailors, taken prisoner by German commerce-raiders, were liberated. On 1 March, five Albacores from &quot;Formidable&quot; flying from a landing ground at Mersa Taclai raided Massawa again but caused little damage. MS &quot;Himalaya&quot; (6,240 GRT) departed on 1 March and reached Rio de Janeiro on 4 April. On 4 March &quot;Coburg&quot;, with a captured tanker, &quot;Ketty Brovig&quot; (7,031 GRT) were spotted by an aircraft flown from &quot;Canberra&quot; south-east of the Seychelles; when &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Leander&quot; approached, the Axis crews scuttled their ships.

From 1 to 4 March, the submarines &quot;Guglielmo Marconi&quot;, &quot;Galileo Ferraris&quot;, &quot;Perla&quot; and &quot;Archimede&quot; sailed from Massawa for BETASOM, an Italian submarine flotilla operating in the Atlantic at Bordeaux. The boats arrived from 7 to 20 May, after taking on supplies from German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic. On 16 March Force D from Aden conducted Operation Appearance, a landing at Berbera, the beginning of the re-conquest of British Somaliland. The Axis ships &quot;Oder&quot; (8,516 GRT) and &quot;India&quot; (6,366 GRT) sailed from Massawa on 23 March but &quot;Shoreham&quot; caught up with &quot;Oder&quot; at the Straits of Perim, the western channel of the Bab-el-Mandeb and the crew scuttled the ship; &quot;India&quot; took refuge in Assab. &quot;Bertrand Rickmers&quot; (4,188 GRT) tried to break out on 29 March but was intercepted by &quot;Kandahar&quot; and scuttled; &quot;Piave&quot; set out on 30 March but only got as far as Assab. On 31 March, three of the Italian destroyers at Massawa sortied against shipping in the Gulf of Suez. &quot;Leone&quot; ran aground outside Massawa and had to be sunk, after which the sortie was abandoned. departed on 1 April but was forced to turn back. On 2 April, the five remaining Italian destroyers were due to attack the fuel tanks at Port Sudan and then scuttle themselves but RAF reconnaissance aircraft from Aden spotted the ships.

While was waiting to pass from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, 813 Naval Air Squadron and 824 Naval Air Squadron, with 17 Swordfish torpedo bombers, were flown to Port Sudan. On 2 April two Swordfish bombed a freighter at Merca and at dawn on 3 April, Operation Atmosphere began with a search by six of the Swordfish at At another Swordfish spotted four Italian destroyers east of Port Sudan. Three of the Swordfish on patrol were called in and the four aircraft bombed, achieving several near misses with bombs. One Swordfish remained to shadow the ships as the others returned to rearm and at seven Swordfish attacked, one aircraft from the rear and one from each side of each target. &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; was hit by all six bombs from one Swordfish and quickly sank; casualties were caused to the other three ships by near-misses. Five Blenheims of 14 Squadron RAF arrived in time to see &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; hit and attacked a stationary destroyer and reported that its crew abandoned ship, that it was set on fire, exploded and sank but &quot;Cesare Battisti&quot; was later found beached on the Arabian coast.

At another four Swordfish found the Italian destroyers distant. &quot;Daniele Manin&quot; was hit amidships by two bombs and the crew abandoned ship; three Swordfish obtained near misses. The last two destroyers were shadowed until they were out of range. &quot;Pantera&quot; and &quot;Tigre&quot; were found south of Jeddah where they were being abandoned. Blenheims of 14 Squadron and Wellesleys of 223 Squadron from Port Sudan claimed hits on both ships, one catching fire but hit nothing; the destroyer &quot;Kingston&quot; destroyed the ships. &quot;Vincenzo Orsini&quot; which had run aground at Massawa managed to refloat and was scuttled in the harbour on 8 April after being bombed by the Swordfish of 813 NAS; the torpedo boat &quot;Giovanni Acerbi&quot; was also sunk by aircraft. On 7 April, before being scuttled, the antiquated &quot;MAS-213&quot; (MAS, motor torpedo boat) a survivor of the Great War, torpedoed the cruiser &quot;Capetown&quot; as it escorted minesweepers off Massawa. &quot;Capetown&quot; was towed to Port Sudan, eventually to sail for Bombay where it was under repair for a year, then relegated to an accommodation ship.

==Operations, May–November 1941==
===Assab===


After the surrender by Aosta at Amba Alagi on 18 May 1941, some Italian forces held out at Assab, the last Italian harbour on the Red Sea. Operation Chronometer took place from 10 to 11 June, with a surprise landing at Assab by the 3/15th Punjab Regiment from Aden, carried by a flotilla comprising , &quot;Indus&quot;, , and SS &quot;Tuna&quot;. &quot;Dido&quot; bombarded the shore from ; aircraft flew overhead and bombed the port to drown the sound of two motor-boats carrying thirty soldiers each. At the troops disembarked on the pier unopposed; two Italian generals, one being Pietro Piacentini, the commander of , were taken prisoner in their beds and the success signal was fired at 

The flotilla entered the harbour behind a minesweeper and landed the rest of the Punjabis, who sent parties to search the islands nearby and found them to be unoccupied. At the Civil Governor was taken to &quot;Dido&quot; and surrendered Assab to the Senior Officer Red Sea Force (Rear-Admiral Ronald Halifax) and the army commander, Brigadier Harry Dimoline. During the evening, Captain Bolla, the Senior Naval Officer at Assab, was captured. Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and told the British that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took in the operation along with the two generals and On 13 June, the Indian trawler &quot;Parvati&quot; struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.

===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===

A force under General Pietro Gazzera, the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the Free Belgian forces (Major-General Auguste Gilliaert) who had defeated the Italians at Asosa and Saïo. On 6 July, Gazzera and and formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of as the .

Uolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about . The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with and soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W. A. L. James). Work began to repair the road to Gondar during the autumn rains.

===Battle of Gondar===

Gondar, the capital of Begemder Province in north-west Ethiopia, was about west of Amba Alagi. After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end. After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA. On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender. On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with and troops, British losses being killed, six men missing and shot down since 7 April. In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of and and wounded.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete, the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War. In 2004, the American historian Douglas Porch wrote that the &quot;pearl of the fascist regime&quot; had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a &quot;stunning&quot; lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.

Ethiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons. The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the &quot;deficiency of the Italian race&quot; but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East. With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of Axis forces, President Franklin Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.

===Signals intelligence===
The Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&amp;CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new and ciphers. Sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation when the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies which the British easily eavesdropped, led to a flood of information from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the and on the retreat from Keren. On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that

===Casualties===
On 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that had been killed, and during military operations before the surrender. Casualties among NCOs and other ranks were and (inclusive). Casualties among locally recruited soldiers were and before the surrender; the figures did not include forces on the Giuba and eastern fronts. By May 1941, of the men in the AOI available for military operations in June 1940, only the in the garrisons near Gondar and the seven colonial divisions in Galla-Sidamo remained to be taken prisoner. More casualties among the Italian and colonial troops occurred after April 1941, in the operations against Amba Alagi (3,500 casualties), Kulkaber/Culqualber (1,003 killed and 804 wounded) and Gondar (4,000 killed and 8,400 sick and wounded). In 1959, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that from June 1940 to May 1941, the East African Force had casualties and or accident cases, including and cases of which fatal. The RAF lost and the lost the in the AOI when the war began and the to the region during the campaign. The Belgian suffered from all causes. The South African contingent suffered 1,756 casualties from all causes in 1941.

===Subsequent operations===
====Guerrilla warfare====


Until 27 November 1941, two African divisions mopped up pockets of resistance until the last formed Italian units surrendered. From the end of 1941 to September 1943, men in scattered Italian units fought a guerrilla war from the deserts of Eritrea and Somalia to the forests and mountains of Ethiopia. They supposedly did so in the hope of holding out until the Germans and Italians in Egypt (or even possibly the Japanese in India) intervened. Amedeo Guillet was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was Hamid Idris Awate, a father of the Eritrean Liberation Front.

Other Italian officers were Captain Francesco De Martini in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland &quot;blackshirt centurion&quot; De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Rosa Dainelli sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa. Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the Armistice of Cassibile. About 3,000 Italian soldiers remained at war until October 1943, unaware of the Armistice. The Woyane Rebellion was promoted by the Italian guerrillas, in early 1943 in Tigray province, there were 20,000–30,000 rebels, hostile to Haile Selassie, against about 5,000 Ethiopian regulars, led by Blatta Haile Mariam Redda, a former Italian-appointed &quot;chika shum&quot;.

====Post-war====
In January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. Makonnen Endelkachew was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1952, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as protectorates. In November 1949, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, the Trust Territory of Somalia (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the Somali Republic.

<text>The Castle-class corvette was an ocean going convoy escort developed by the United Kingdom during the Second World War. It was the follow-on to the , and designed to be built in shipyards that were producing the Flowers. The Castle-class was a general improvement over the smaller Flowers which were designed for coastal rather than open ocean use.

The Castle-class corvettes started appearing in service during late 1943.

==Background==
In mid-1939, the Admiralty ordered 175 Flower-class corvettes for protecting shipping on the east coast of Britain. They were designed to be built in large numbers in small shipyards without propulsion and other components (mainly gearboxes, but also guns) then in short supply so not compete with other warships for construction. By the time the Flowers began entering service in late-1940, due to their long range they were required to undertake missions beyond coastal waters. The Flowers were unsuited for open-ocean escort missions in the North Atlantic, especially in poor weather; they lacked speed, endurance, and habitability but became the mainstay of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force protecting convoys crossing the Atlantic.

The Royal Navy recognized the limitations of the Flower and began designing an open-ocean escort in November 1940, which became the . The larger Rivers were too expensive to produce at the required rate and needed larger slipways. In response, the was developed in late-1942, which was developed from the River and designed for prefabricated construction. The Castle was developed from a proposal by Smith&#x27;s Dock Company – who had designed the Flower-class – for a stretched Flower. The result was a scaled-down version of the Loch for shipyards that only built corvettes using mainly traditional methods.

The design was approved in May 1943 and 96 Castles were ordered from yards in the UK and Canada. Fifteen British and all 37 Canadian ships were later cancelled; Canada receiving twelve British-built ships instead. The UK completed a further five as convoy rescue ships for its Merchant Navy. Four became weather ships after the war.

==Design==
The Castle resembled later Flowers with an extended forecastle and mast behind the bridge, but was 135 tons heavier and 47 feet longer. The Admiralty Experiment Works at Haslar developed an improved hull form which, in combination with the increased length, made the Castle at least half a knot faster than the Flower despite using the same engine. The Castle also had a single-screw. A lattice mainmast was used instead of the pole version fitted to the Flowers.

Construction used mainly traditional methods with as much welding as possible. Scantling was based on the Flower, but lightened in some areas. The wireless office (the same as on the Loch), the radar office, and the lattice mast were installed as prefabricated units.

The Castle was armed with a Squid anti-submarine mortar, directed by Type 145 and 147B ASDIC. The Flower used the older Hedgehog mortar and could not be fitted with Squid. The first operational Type 147 and Squid were installed aboard HMS &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot; in September 1943.

In place of the BL 4-inch Mk IX main gun, the Castles had the new QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun on a High-Angle/Low-Angle mounting which could be used against aircraft as well as surface targets such as submarines.

==In service==
The Castle was criticized for being barely fast enough to fight German Type VII submarines and difficult to handle at low speed.

== Ships ==

===Royal Canadian Navy===
The following vessels were all originally built for the Royal Navy, but were transferred to the RCN on completion (for details of builders and construction dates see under Royal Navy below). All their pennant numbers (except &quot;Hedingham Castle&quot;, which was never completed), as well as their names, were changed when transferred.
* HMCS &quot;Arnprior&quot; (K494) (ex-)
* HMCS &quot;Bowmanville&quot; (K493) (ex-), sold to Republic of China as cargo ship, but taken over by the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy after the end of the Chinese Civil War and rearmed with Soviet guns, entering PLAN service as &quot;Guangzhou&quot;.
* HMCS &quot;Copper Cliff&quot; (K495) (ex-)
* HMCS &quot;Hespeler&quot; (K489) (ex-) (later SS &quot;Chilcotin&quot;)

* HMCS &quot;Orangeville&quot; (K491) (ex-), sold to Republic of China as cargo ship, but taken over by the ROC Navy on 29 June 1950 and rearmed with US guns, entering ROCN service as &quot;De An&quot; (德安)
* HMCS &quot;Petrolia&quot; (K498) (ex-)
* HMCS &quot;St. Thomas&quot; (K488) (ex-, later SS &quot;Camosun III&quot;)
* HMCS &quot;Tillsonburg&quot; (K496) (ex-), sold to Republic of China as cargo ship, but taken over by ROCN on 29 June 1950 and rearmed with US guns, entering ROCN service as &quot;Kao An&quot; (高安)

===Royal Navy===
The first of the Castle-class were the prototypes &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot; and &quot;Kenilworth Castle&quot;, ordered on 9 December 1942; another 12 vessels were also ordered on 9 December, also under the 1942 War Programme. The remaining eighty-one ships were all ordered for the RN under the 1943 War Programme, of which thirty were completed. Fifty-one of these ships (15 from UK shipyards and 36 from Canadian shipyards) were cancelled late in 1943.

Notes: (a) from the previous order placed for a Modified Flower-class corvette named &quot;Amaryllis&quot;.

Two of those ordered 3 March 1943, three ordered 4 May 1943 and two ordered 10 July 1943 were all cancelled, as were all thirty-six ordered from Canadian shipyards on 15 March 1943.

<doc id="988240" wikidata="Q334478" url="?curid=988240" title="Demaratus">
<text>Demaratus (Greek: Δημάρατος, &quot;Demaratos&quot;; Doric: Δαμάρατος, &quot;Damaratos&quot;) was a king of Sparta from around 515 BC to 491 BC. He was the 15th ruler of the Eurypontid dynasty and the firstborn son of King Ariston. During his reign, Demaratus is best known for his opposition to his co-ruler, King Cleomenes I of the Agiad dynasty. This rivalry ultimately led to his dethronement around 491 BC, following Cleomenes&#x27; accusations of illegitimacy and political maneuvering.

After his removal from power, Demaratus sought refuge in the Achaemenid Empire, where he was welcomed by King Darius I. He was granted land and cities in Asia Minor, integrating him into Persian society while retaining his influence. Demaratus served as an advisor to Xerxes I during the Second Persian invasion of Greece, providing strategic insights about Greek military tactics.

== Early life ==
Demaratus was born into the Eurypontid dynasty of Sparta and was the firstborn son of King Ariston. His father&#x27;s significance in the highly structured Spartan society meant Demaratus&#x27; firstborn status held considerable weight. According to Herodotus, Demaratus&#x27; birth was accompanied by a prophecy that suggested his future prominence and influence, with his name meaning &quot;wished by the people.&quot; In Herodotus&#x27; writing, we see that King Ariston initially doubted his son&#x27;s true parentage. &quot;And he, after remembering when he had married the woman and counting out the months on his fingers, swore an oath: &#x27;He could not be my own son!&#x27;&quot; As Demaratus grew, Ariston repented what he had sworn and regarded Demaratus as his own.

Upon King Ariston&#x27;s death, Demaratus ascended to the throne around 515 BCE. His rise to kingship made him the 15th ruler of the Eurypontid line. His succession appears fairly straightforward, as Ariston eventually claimed Demaratus as his own son.  

== Reign ==

=== Reign in Sparta ===
When Cleomenes attempted to make Isagoras tyrant in Athens, Demaratus tried to frustrate the plans. In 491 BC, Aegina was one of the states that gave the symbols of submission (earth and water) to Persia. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish that act of medism, and Cleomenes I crossed over to the island to arrest those responsible. His first attempt was unsuccessful because of interference from Demaratus, who did his utmost to bring Cleomenes into disfavor at home.

In retaliation, Cleomenes urged Leotychidas, a relative and personal enemy of Demaratus, to claim the throne on the grounds that the latter was really the son not of Ariston but of Agetus, his mother&#x27;s first husband. Leotychidas&#x27; anger towards Demaratus was due to a dispute over the marriage of Perkalon, the daughter of Chilon, son of Demarmenos. Initially, Leotychidas was arranged to marry Perkalon, but Demaratus seized her as his own. Cleomenes bribed the Delphic oracle to pronounce in favor of Leotychidas, who became king in 491 BC.   

After the deposition of Demaratus, Cleomenes visited the island of Aegina for a second time. Accompanied by his new colleague, Leotychidas, he seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.

=== In exile ===
On his abdication, Demaratus was forced to flee. He went to the court of Persian King Xerxes I, who gave him the cities of Teuthrania and Halisarna, around Pergamum.

Demaratus accompanied Xerxes I on his invasion of Greece in 480 BC and is alleged to have warned Xerxes not to underestimate the Spartans before the Battle of Thermopylae:
Xerxes also asked Demaratus about his knowledge of the Greeks and if they would put up a fight against the Persian army. In response, Demaratus spoke favorably about the Greeks even after he had been deposed and exiled from Sparta:

== Death and succession ==
There is no known year for Demaratus&#x27; death. Afterward, however, his sons, Eurysthenes and Prokles, succeeded him in ruling over the cities of Halisarna and Teuthrania in Aeolis. This succession maintained the connection between Demaratus&#x27; lineage and the city granted to him by the Persian king. His descendants ruled this area for approximately the next 80 years.

Demaratus&#x27; family continued to flourish in Asia as subjects of the Persians, and several of his descendants have been identified. One of them was likely Demaratus, the son of Gorgion, who was restored to Sparta in the early 3rd century BC and was, in turn, the putative great-grandfather of Nabis, the last king of Sparta (ruled 207–192).

==Greek exiles in Achaemenid Empire==
Demaratus was one of several Greeks aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire after reversals at home. Other famous cases were Themistocles and Gongylos. In general, they were generously rewarded by the Achaemenid kings, received land grants to support them and ruled over various cities in Asia Minor.

<doc id="988244" wikidata="Q5172945" url="?curid=988244" title="Corridors of Power (novel)">
<text>Corridors of Power is the ninth book in C. P. Snow&#x27;s &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; series. Its title had become a household phrase referring to the centres of government and power after Snow coined it in his earlier novel, &quot;Homecomings&quot;. (A slightly rueful Foreword to &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; expresses the hope that he is at least entitled to use his own cliché.)

==Plot synopsis==
&quot;Corridors of Power&quot; is concerned with the attempts of an English MP to influence the country&#x27;s policy on nuclear weapons in the 1950s. The central character is Roger Quaife, an ambitious politician and Cabinet Minister. He is widely attacked for his stand on Britain&#x27;s position in the thermonuclear arms race; at the same time his extramarital affair leads to potential blackmail. Lewis Eliot attempts to assist him in covering up the affair as he supports Quaife&#x27;s stand on the nuclear question.

==Reception==
In a 1964 book review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book &quot;a sound reading of the political, moral, ideological temper of the times; a substantial achievement even though one in which intellect has been asserted at the expense of imagination.&quot; In a 1964 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, an anonymous reviewer praised Snow&#x27;s previous work, but called the novel &quot;the least successful in the series&quot; and summarized; &quot;Somehow the vitality, the narrative drive and the intellectual excitement of Sir Charles&#x27;s other novels are lacking in this one.&quot;

== Dramatic versions ==
In the BBC&#x27;s 1984 television serialisation of &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot;, Shaughan Seymour played Lewis Eliot and Anthony Hopkins played Roger Quaife.

<doc id="988246" wikidata="Q2141140" url="?curid=988246" title="Treaty of Madrid (1670)">
<text>The Treaty of Madrid, also known as the Godolphin Treaty, was a treaty between England and Spain that was agreed to in July 1670 &quot;for the settlement of all disputes in America&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP 108/470&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty officially ended the war begun in 1654 in the Caribbean in which England had conquered Jamaica.

The 1670 Treaty of Madrid was highly favourable to England, as its adverse possession in the Caribbean Sea and the rest of the Americas was confirmed and made legal by Spain. Before 1670, Spain had exclusively regarded the Americas as Spanish territory with the exception of Brazil, which was Portuguese according to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas that had confirmed Christopher Columbus&#x27; claim of the New World for Spain since 12 October 1494.

==Background==
The Anglo-Spanish War had begun in late 1654, as England joined France in its conflict with Spain. In Europe, the conflict ended with the Treaty of the Pyrenees (between France and Spain) and King Charles II of England&#x27;s restoration in 1660, but a treaty between England and Spain was never signed. The conflict in the Caribbean began with the English failed attempt on Hispaniola, followed by a successful invasion of Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sankey/Francis&quot;&gt;Sankey pp. 663-64&lt;/ref&gt; The region thus remained in a state of war, and privateer raids were launched on the Spanish Main led by buccaneers notably Christopher Myngs and Henry Morgan under the behest of Jamaican Governor Thomas Modyford As far as Modyford was concerned, Jamaica would never be secure until Spain had acknowledged England&#x27;s possession of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and in a treaty. In 1667 the Treaty of Madrid was signed between England and Spain. Although favourable to the former in terms of trade, there was no mention of the American colonies or the Caribbean as rightful possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher/Savelle65&quot;&gt;Fisher/Savelle p.65 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks, therefore, continued, notably Morgan&#x27;s brutal attack and sackings of Portobello and Lake Maracaibo over the next two years.

In 1669, Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, in response ordered attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. Charles II ordered Modyford to issue official letters of marque against the Spanish. Modyford commissioned Morgan once more to raid the Spanish Main. Spain was politically, economically and militarily weak after years of war and political infighting. Charles saw an opportunity that he could not miss and felt the time was right to negotiate a treaty with Spain since England held a great advantage. The only way Spain could be at an advantage was to recapture Jamaica or France and Holland to join in a potential war, which Charles was seeking to avoid.

Negotiations began in the autumn of 1669 between the Spanish representative Gaspar de Bracamonte, Count of Peñaranda, with William Godolphin, Envoy Extraordinary from England.

The original language of the treaty was in Latin, and the complete English title was &quot;A treaty for the composing of differences, restraining of depredations, and establishing of peace in America, between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain, concluded at Madrid the 8/18 day of July, in the year of our Lord 1670&quot;.

==Terms==
Spain began to legally recognize in Article VII of the 1670 Treaty of Madrid, any territories in the Americas known as the Western Hemisphere that England&#x27;s subjects had illegally settled by adverse possession. Before the 1670 treaty, Spain legally considered the Western Hemisphere exclusively as Spanish territory with the exception of Brazil which according to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas was Portuguese. That treaty acknowledged Christopher Columbus&#x27; claiming the Western Hemisphere for Spain on October 12, 1492. The Madrid treaty modified Tordesillas in favour of an English legal presence in the Americas.

Under the terms of the treaty, all letters of reprisal were revoked by Spain, and reciprocal aid to ships in distress along with permission to repair in each others ports were required.

England agreed to suppress piracy in the Caribbean, and in return, Spain agreed to permit English ships freedom of movement. Both agreed to refrain from trading in the other&#x27;s Caribbean territory and to limit trading to their own possessions.

The treaty was then ratified on 28 September.

==Consequences==
In Spain and its colonies, the treaty was hated and viewed by many as a humiliating surrender. Spain&#x27;s military, economic and political weakness meant that it was unable to pose any will, which England had taken easy advantage of. Spanish merchants in particular were unwilling to accept the treaty, and the Spanish crown had to give special tax Cédulas as compensation.

The treaty was highly favourable to England, on the other hand, and the fact that Spain recognised England&#x27;s colonies in the Americas was a major concession. In previous treaties, Spain had always insisted that the New World west of Brazil belonged to it alone.

England effectively challenged Spain in the western Caribbean, and subsequently used Jamaica as a base to support settlements all along the Central American Caribbean coast from the Yucatán to (present day) Nicaragua. The new logwood stations there were accepted by Spain but were not recognised and this increased as many ex privateers turned to logwooding. As such, the treaty did not establish any boundaries: Spain and England only adopted, in Article 7, the principle of actual possession. In Northern America, &quot;this compact legalized England&#x27;s ownership as far south as Charleston, and Spain&#x27;s as far north as Santa Elena Sound, in 32°, 30&#x27; north latitude&quot;. As a result, it was met with consternation by the Spanish in Florida, who, despite protests, had to accept the newly encroached English colony of Charleston.

Although piracy was suppressed, English ships were now able to roam the Caribbean without hindrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sankey/Francis&quot;&gt;Sankey pp. 663-64&lt;/ref&gt; England had sought that in negotiations with Spain in 1655, but the Spanish had refused. Spain&#x27;s acquiescence reversed its previous position that defined any English person in the West Indies as an intruder or a pirate.

News of the treaty, however, did not reach the Caribbean in time for Henry Morgan, who on 28 January 1671 launched a devastating raid on Panama City. The Spanish were furious, and the English saw that Morgan and Modyford had violated the treaty. To restore relations, both Modyford and Morgan were recalled and arrested. They went unpunished, however, and were released. Morgan was even knighted by Charles and made Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica.

Spain and England remained at peace until 1702 with the War of the Spanish Succession.

<text>Margaret Ellen Sawyer is a fictional character appearing in media published by DC Comics, primarily in association with Superman. She is a member of the Metropolis police and handles crimes when Superman is unavailable.

The character appeared in the live-action series &quot;Smallville&quot;, played by Jill Teed, and in the second and third seasons of the Arrowverse series &quot;Supergirl&quot;, played by Floriana Lima. Furthermore, Joanna Cassidy voices Sawyer in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU).

== Publication history ==
Maggie Sawyer first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #4 and was created by John Byrne.

== Fictional character biography ==

Maggie Sawyer was introduced in the second volume of &quot;Superman&quot; in April 1987 as the captain of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit. She largely replaced Inspector Henderson from the previous comics as Superman&#x27;s police contact.

Sawyer tries to prove the police force is more efficient than a vigilante in fighting crime, and so becomes a constant thorn in Superman&#x27;s side during the early days of his career, even trying to apprehend him occasionally. Eventually, after being injured and saved by Superman during a terrorist plot, her attitude towards him warms up.

Later stories revealed that she originally came from Star City. She married fellow police officer James Sawyer, although she was uncertain about her own sexual identity, and they had a daughter named Jamie.
Maggie later came out as lesbian. James divorced her and won sole custody of Jamie and he refused to let Maggie have contact with their daughter. Maggie moved to Metropolis when the SCU position became available and resumed relations with her family in later stories.
Maggie has been in a long-term relationship with Toby Raynes, a reporter for the &quot;Metropolis Star&quot;.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #600, Lex Luthor, then a corporate executive, met with Maggie to get her to stop investigating his activities and tries to blackmail her with documentation regarding her sexuality, which would discredit her and taint her career. When Luthor injures himself and flees the room due to kryptonite poisoning, Maggie is tempted with taking the evidence left behind on his desk, but decides against it.

Maggie has a close working relationship with Dan Turpin, her second-in-command at the SCU. However, she originally had a strained professional relationship with Inspector Henderson. It was later revealed that Henderson simply disapproved that higher-ranking officers, such as Turpin, reported to her, a Captain. He resolves the situation by promoting her to Inspector when he becomes Commissioner during &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; storyline. In the aftermath, Sawyer becomes involved in a covert &#x27;war&#x27; between Superman&#x27;s allies and Project Cadmus, which stole Superman&#x27;s body for their own ends.

Sawyer&#x27;s close friendship with injured ex-police officer Eddie Walker is examined in flashback as Walker becomes the hero Loose Cannon.

=== &quot;Metropolis S.C.U.&quot; ===
Maggie Sawyer is the main character in the four-issue limited series comic title &quot;Metropolis SCU&quot; written by Cindy Goff, penciled by Peter Krause and inked by José Marzan Jr., which was published from November 1994 to February 1995. The series features Lois Lane joining the S.C.U. to gain a deeper understanding of their operations. Meanwhile, a rogue scientist attempts to destroy the Earth via lasers from space.

For this miniseries appearance, Sawyer received the 7th Outstanding Comic Strip GLAAD Media Awards in March 1996.

=== &quot;Batman: No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; ===
In mid-2000s comics, Maggie transfers to Gotham City&#x27;s police force as the head of the Major Crimes Unit, and is a significant character in the comic &quot;Gotham Central&quot;. The move has placed some strain on her relationship, since Toby did not follow her to Gotham.

Following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Harvey Bullock discovers corruption in the GCPD apparently all the way up to Commissioner Michael Akins. In the end, James Gordon returns to his former position as commissioner. Maggie Sawyer, however, does not appear to be involved and is still a Captain.

=== &quot;52&quot; ===
Maggie appeared in the series &quot;52&quot;.

In Week Three, she arrives to a scene to find the body of Alex Luthor. She calls in Steel to ID the body, when Lex Luthor comes in with the press and announces that Alex was the one responsible for all of Luthor&#x27;s wrongdoings.

In Week Twelve, Maggie yells at Montoya for busting up a cover for Intergang, closing all leads to the criminal group in Gotham City.

=== &quot;Detective Comics&quot; ===
Maggie appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #856 at a charity ball attended by Kate Kane. While the two are dancing, Maggie mentions that she and Toby are no longer together and asks Kate for her phone number.

=== &quot;Batwoman&quot; ===
Sawyer appears as a supporting character in the new Batwoman series launched in 2011 as part of &quot;The New 52&quot; initiative. In that series she has begun dating Kate Kane, whose secret activities as Batwoman complicate their relationship. The prequel event &quot;Zero Year&quot; establishes she and Kate had first crossed paths when Maggie, as a Metropolis police officer, arrived in Gotham as backup support for an approaching hurricane; the two share a brief glance in precinct headquarters after Kate gets treatment for minor injuries she received while foiling a burglary during the storm. Kane reveals her identity as Batwoman by proposing to her in costume in &quot;Batwoman&quot; #17.

After Commissioner Jason Bard resigns, Maggie is appointed in his place. However, she ended up stepping down to return to the MCU, and has Gordon restored as Commissioner.

<doc id="988258" wikidata="Q359143" url="?curid=988258" title="Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland">
<text>Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, KG (27 April 1564 – 5 November 1632) was an English nobleman. He was a grandee and one of the wealthiest peers of the court of Elizabeth I. Under James I, Northumberland was a long-term prisoner in the Tower of London, due to the suspicion that he was complicit in the Gunpowder Plot. He is known for the circles he moved in as well as for his own achievements. He acquired the sobriquet The Wizard Earl (also given to Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare), from his scientific and alchemical experiments, his passion for cartography, and his large library.

==Early life==
He was born at Tynemouth Castle in Northumberland, England, the son of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland, whom he succeeded in 1585. His father died, an apparent suicide, in the Tower of London, where he was being questioned about his allegedly treasonable dealings with Mary, Queen of Scots. His mother was Katherine Neville, daughter and co-heiress of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer and Lucy Somerset. She remarried Francis Fitton of Binfield.

He was brought up a Protestant, as his father had been, taking instruction from the vicar of Egremont. This did not prevent suspicions in later life, particularly when he associated with Charles Paget, that he was a crypto-Catholic. Around 1586, he first employed the artist Nicolas Hilliard paying 60 shillings for his portrait. In 1598 he bought a jewel called the &quot;Rainbow&quot; for £21 from John Spilman. The earl had an African servant who was called the &quot;Blackamore&quot; in his accounts. The African servant was brought to the earl in 1586 by Mr Crosse&#x27;s servant, who was rewarded with 20 shillings, and the earl bought new clothes for the African servant costing £6-12s-6d. New shoes in 1588 cost 18 pence.

Although his earldom was in the north of England, Northumberland also had estates in the south at Petworth House in Sussex and also at Syon House in Middlesex, acquired by his marriage to Lady Dorothy Devereux (sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex) in 1594.

They had four children:
*Lady Dorothy Percy ( 1598 – 20 August 1659); married Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, by whom she had six children.
*Lady Lucy Percy (1599/1600 – 5 November 1660); married, as his second wife, James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle.
*Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland (29 September 1602 – 13 October 1668); married, firstly, Anne Cecil, by whom he had five daughters, including Elizabeth Percy, Countess of Essex; he married, secondly, Lady Elizabeth Howard, by whom he had his heir, Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland.
*Henry Percy, Baron Percy of Alnwick (1604 – April 1659); died unmarried.

Though it did produce a male heir, Algernon, the marriage was not successful, and the couple separated after a time, despite efforts by the queen, who was fond of Dorothy, to reconcile them.

==Catholic sympathiser==
The Percy family was still largely Catholic, while Northumberland was at least nominally Protestant. When it became clear that the Protestant James VI of Scotland was likely to succeed Elizabeth, Northumberland sent his cousin Thomas Percy, a recent Catholic convert, on a secret mission to James&#x27;s court three times in 1602. He said that English Catholics would accept James as king if he reduced the persecution of Catholics. Northumberland employed Thomas Percy as a rent collector at Syon House. Thomas was the great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland, but was unscrupulous, with 34 charges of dishonesty brought against him. Henry wrote to James &quot;It were a pity to lose a good Kingdom for not tolerating a mass in a corner&quot;. Through Thomas Percy, Henry received loosely worded assurances of religious tolerance from James.

Shortly before James&#x27;s accession to the English throne in 1603, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury through Lord Henry Howard particularly warned the king against Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Northumberland. This theory of the &quot;diabolical triplicity&quot; rested on innuendo, about the occult interests supposedly cultivated by the intellectual circles led by Percy and Raleigh, and possibly on the traitorous intent suggested only by rumours from the 1580s that Percy would marry Arbella Stuart, the next heir to the throne after the King and his offspring. Brooke led the Main Plot against James, and Raleigh soon lost his freedom. Northumberland, on the other hand, was appointed to the Privy Council.

The Earl of Northumberland bought Walsingham House in London&#x27;s Seething Lane for £2,200 in 1603. In 1604, the house was visited by the Jesuit Henry Garnet and the Spanish ambassador Juan de Tassis, 1st Count of Villamediana.

Thomas Percy went on to become one of the five conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The goal of this plot was to overthrow the Parliament under King James I. When the plot was discovered, Percy fled and was besieged at Holbeche House in Warwickshire. On 8 November 1605, a marksman shot dead both Robert Catesby and Thomas Percy with a single bullet.

The Earl of Northumberland was suspected of misprision (having knowledge of the plot but not notifying the authorities). However, the Star Chamber did not have sufficient evidence to convict him of misprision and was unable to disprove his claim that he planned to be present at the fatal meeting of Parliament. They had to resort to more minor charges including his appointment of Thomas Percy to the Gentlemen Pensioners, of which Northumberland was captain, without the king&#x27;s permission and without Percy taking the Oath of Supremacy. Northumberland was sent to the Tower of London at the king&#x27;s pleasure and remained there for almost 16 years. He was also fined £30,000, , but in 1613, the king accepted £11,000 in final payment.

==In the Tower==
Still a rich man, Northumberland made himself comfortable in the Tower of London. He had spacious apartments in the Martin Tower, which he redecorated and refurbished. He was attended by 20 servants, some of whom he lodged on Tower Hill. He spent £50 per year on books and grew a considerable library. He had his own covered bowling alley and access to facilities for tennis and fencing. He regularly met scholars whom he patronised, including Thomas Harriot, Walter Warner and Robert Hues, who were known as the &quot;Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s Magi&quot;. Together with Sir Walter Raleigh, who had preceded Northumberland to the Tower with a death sentence hanging over him, they discussed advanced scientific ideas and smoked tobacco.

From 1616, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset were inmates of the Tower and on social terms with Northumberland. Frances promoted the marriage of his second daughter Lucy Percy to James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle. He disapproved of the proposed marriage saying that he would not see his daughter, &quot;dance to a Scotch jig.&quot; For a period, he forced Lucy to reside with him in the Tower but Frances outwitted him. Despite Northumberland&#x27;s extreme disapproval of the marriage, Hay was determined to win his father-in-law&#x27;s respect and fought for Northumberland&#x27;s release from the Tower, which was achieved in July 1621.

After his release, experiencing deafness and poor eyesight, he went to the Bath Inn, later referred to as the Arundel House, to regain his health. Once recovered Northumberland retired to Petworth House where he remained until his death on 5 November 1632.

His wife died in 1619.

==Intellectual interests and associates==

Because of his interest in scientific experiments and his library, Northumberland acquired the nickname &quot;The Wizard Earl&quot;. The library was one of the largest in England at the time. He was a patron to Thomas Harriot, Nicholas Hill, Robert Hues, Nathaniel Torporley and Walter Warner. The astrologer John Dee, nearby Syon House at Mortlake, was also a friend of Henry, and their circles overlapped. 

Harriot had been a navigational tutor to Raleigh and his captains. From 1598 (or possibly from 1607) Harriot lived at Syon House. There he used a telescope to make a map of the Moon several months before Galileo did the same. He may have been the first person to observe sunspots.

Northumberland had also connections to the &quot;literati&quot;. George Peele wrote a poem, &quot;The Honour of the Garter&quot;, dedicated to Percy and for the occasion of his admission to the Order of the Garter, on 26 June 1593. For his efforts Peele was paid £3. Christopher Marlowe claimed his acquaintance and certainly moved in the same group. Percy was a friend to John Donne. After Donne&#x27;s elopement and clandestine marriage in 1601, he had the task of taking a letter for him to the new father-in-law, Sir George More.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (1594), there is a mention of the &quot;School of Night&quot;. It has been argued that this refers to a circle of scientific investigators who met at Syon House, though other commentators think the word &quot;school&quot; is a misprint for something like &quot;shawl&quot;. Since Percy was often considered to be an atheist, the &quot;school&quot; was sometimes referred to as the &quot;School of Atheism&quot;. Raleigh was the supposed leader and Thomas Harriot and Marlowe were supposedly members. Frances Yates comments on this hypothetical group, supposedly including also George Chapman as the author of &quot;Shadow of Night&quot;, as arguably part of Raleigh&#x27;s circle, to the effect that they would be &quot;Saturnians&quot; in the sense of her study.

<text>George Passant is the first published of C. P. Snow&#x27;s series of novels &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot;, but the second according to the internal chronology. It was first published under the name &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot;. It was published in the United Kingdom in 1940 and in the U.S. in 1960.

==Plot synopsis==
George Passant is a solicitor in a small English town, whose idealism and eccentricity lead him to accumulate a group of young followers in a mentor-like capacity. Narrated by Lewis Eliot, the novel has the more general background of Eliot&#x27;s rising career and the changes in English society through the 20th century.

==Reception==
In a 1960 book review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, the book was called a &quot;slowly, closely pursued examination and rationale and an enlightened discussion of questions of conscience and conduct and commitment. And as such, if within a narrower margin, it is filled with the concerns which are so fundamentally and essentially a part of this writer&#x27;s work and have attracted a firm following.&quot;

<text>Car and Driver (CD or C/D) is an American automotive enthusiast magazine first published in 1955. In 2006 its total circulation was 1.23 million. It is owned by Hearst Magazines, who purchased it from its prior owner Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in 2011. It was founded as &quot;Sports Cars Illustrated.&quot; The magazine is based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

==History==
&quot;Car and Driver&quot; was founded as &quot;Sports Cars Illustrated&quot; in 1955. In its early years, the magazine focused primarily on small, imported sports cars. In 1961, editor Karl Ludvigsen renamed the magazine &quot;Car and Driver&quot; to show a more general automotive focus.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; once featured Bruce McCall, Jean Shepherd, and Brock Yates as columnists, and P. J. O&#x27;Rourke as a frequent contributor. Former editors include William Jeanes and David E. Davis, Jr., the latter of whom led some employees to defect in 1985 to create &quot;Automobile&quot;.

When CBS acquired Ziff Davis&#x27; consumer magazines in 1985, the company decided to keep both &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and existing CBS automobile magazine, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. Successive owners keep this arrangement.

Rather than electing a Car of the Year, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; publishes its top ten picks each year in its &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; is home to the John Lingenfelter Memorial Trophy. This award is given annually at their Supercar Challenge.

Currently, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; is also published in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The Spanish version just makes use of the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; name; no editorial direction is shared. China had an edition called &quot;名车志 Car and Driver&quot; (). The Middle Eastern edition is issued by ITP Publishing based in Dubai.

==Editorial direction==
The magazine was one of the first to be unabashedly critical of the American automakers. However, it has been quick to praise noteworthy efforts like the Ford Focus and Chevrolet Corvette.

The magazine has been at the center of a few controversies based on this editorial direction, including the following:

* Their instrumented testing twice revealed false power claims by manufacturers: Both the 1999 SVT Mustang Cobra and 2001 Mazda Miata tests showed these vehicles not producing performance equivalents to their claimed power output. In both cases, the manufacturers&#x27; claims were proved wrong, forcing buybacks and apologies.

* In its Sept. 1990 issue, reviewers operated a GM-EMD SD60 and saw how a locomotive was made and test one out before it was delivered to the Kansas City Southern Railway.

* In its February 1968 issue, Cook Neilson authored a scathing review of the 1968 Kadett LS 1.5L wagon. The vehicle, which by many accounts was a moderately well-executed example in its class, received a singly critical and extensively negative review from Nielson, with General Motors subsequently pulling its advertising from the magazine. Paul Niedermeyer, editor of the automotive history site &quot;Curbside Classics&quot; and managing editor at The Truth About Cars, would later call the review &quot;sophmoric&quot; and &quot;blantantly contrived.&quot; Author Marty Padgett, in his book &quot;50 Years With Car and Driver,” recounted that the magazine&#x27;s editor at the time, Leon Mandel, had wanted a diatribe in order to increase the magazine&#x27;s relevance.

The magazine is widely known for an often irreverent tone, especially regarding cars it considers inferior. The magazine also frequently touches on politics. The editorial slant of the magazine is decidedly pro-automobile.

== Website ==
&quot;Car and Driver&quot; operates a website that features articles (both original and from print), a blog, an automotive buyer&#x27;s guide (with AccuPayment, a price-calculating tool), and a social networking site called Backfires. As had occurred with other online auto magazines, Car and Driver first suspended its popular Backfires column in 2020; then, did make a partial effort in 2021 to continue with readers&#x27; comments, but eventually found, like the other magazines, the effort was too costly and often too divisive.

==&quot;Car and Driver Television&quot;==
&quot;Car and Driver Television&quot; was the television counterpart that formerly aired on TNN/SpikeTV&#x27;s &quot;Powerblock&quot; weekend lineup from 1999 to 2005. It was produced by RTM Productions and hosted by Jim Scoutten—who also hosted &quot;American Shooter&quot;, another RTM production—until 2003. 

Thereafter the usual host was Larry Webster, one of the magazine&#x27;s editors, with Csaba Csere adding occasional commentary and news.

== &quot;Car and Driver&quot; computer game ==
In 1993, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; licensed its name for a PC game to Electronic Arts entitled &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. The game was in 3D, and the courses included racing circuits, an oval track, automobile route racing with traffic, a dragstrip, and an autocross circuit.

The ten vehicles included the Porsche 959, Ferrari F40, Lotus Esprit, Eagle Talon, and the Ferrari 512.

== The &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; ==
In the 1970s, to celebrate the Interstate Highway System and to protest speed limits, reporter Brock Yates and editor Steve Smith conceived the idea of an unsanctioned, informal race across the country, replicating the 53.5-hour transcontinental drive made by car and bike pilot Erwin George &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker in 1933. The New York to Los Angeles Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, later shortened to the &quot;Cannonball Run&quot;, was staged in 1971, 1972, 1975 and 1979, with the race entries including both amateur drivers and professional racers, such as Dan Gurney (who with Brock Yates &quot;won&quot; the 1971 event driving a Ferrari 365 GTB/4, making the journey in under 36 hours). 

The stunt served as the inspiration for several Hollywood blockbusters, such as &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, &quot;Cannonball Run III&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; and &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; franchise.
