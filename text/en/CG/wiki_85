<text>Repulsion is a 1965 British psychological horror thriller film directed by Roman Polanski, and starring Catherine Deneuve. Based on a story written by Polanski and Gérard Brach, the plot follows Carol, a withdrawn, disturbed young woman who, when left alone in the apartment she shares with her sister, is subject to a number of nightmarish experiences. The film focuses on the point of view of Carol and her vivid hallucinations and nightmares as she comes into contact with men and their desires for her. Ian Hendry, John Fraser, Patrick Wymark, and Yvonne Furneaux appear in supporting roles.

Shot in London, it is Polanski&#x27;s first English-language film and second feature-length production, following &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (1962).

The film debuted at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival before receiving theatrical releases internationally. Upon its release, &quot;Repulsion&quot; received considerable critical acclaim and currently is considered one of Polanski&#x27;s greatest works. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Gilbert Taylor&#x27;s cinematography.

==Plot==
Carol Ledoux, a shy Belgian manicurist, lives in London with her older sister Helen. Carol is remarkably detached and struggles in her daily interactions. A suitor, Colin, is enamoured of her and makes fervent attempts to court her, but Carol seems uninterested. Carol is troubled by Helen&#x27;s relationship with a married man named Michael, whom Carol seems to dislike. She is bothered by his habit of leaving his razor and toothbrush in her glass in the bathroom, and at night struggles to sleep, bothered by the sounds of her sister and Michael having sex.

When Carol walks home from work one day, she is bothered by a crack in the pavement. Colin happens upon her and she struggles to converse with him. He drives her home and tries to kiss her several times, but she pulls away, running upstairs and vigorously brushing her teeth before weeping. That night, Helen questions Carol for dumping Michael&#x27;s toothbrush and shaver in the bathroom trash bin. At the salon, Carol becomes increasingly distant, barely talking to her coworkers and customers, so much so that her boss decides to send her home for the day.

That night, Helen and Michael depart for Italy on holiday, leaving Carol alone in the apartment. Carol takes a rabbit out of the fridge for dinner. Instead of cooking it, she is distracted by a number of Michael&#x27;s possessions left around the apartment, including an unwashed shirt whose odour makes her vomit. After trying on one of her sister&#x27;s dresses, Carol sees a dark figure in the mirror. That night, she hears footsteps outside her bedroom. Carol&#x27;s isolation begins to take its toll on her, and she misses three days of work. One morning, she runs a bath and walks away, causing it to overflow. As she turns on a light, the wall cracks open. She locks herself in her room and again hears footsteps. This time, she hallucinates that a man breaks into her room and rapes her. She is awakened in the hallway by a phone call from Colin, but she hangs up.

After returning to the salon, Carol cuts the finger of a client while giving a manicure, and is told to go home early. A concerned coworker finds the uncooked rabbit&#x27;s head in Carol&#x27;s purse. At the apartment, Carol stares at an old family photo and the wall behind the photograph shatters like a mirror. Colin subsequently arrives at the apartment, but Carol refuses to open the door so he breaks in. He declares his love for her, and she responds by bludgeoning him to death with a candlestick. She cleans the blood, barricades the front door, and places Colin&#x27;s corpse in the bathtub. In bed, she experiences the same rape hallucination. She wakes up the next morning, naked on the floor. In a subsequent scene, she walks down the dark hallway of her apartment where hands appear out of the walls and grab her. Later, the angry wife of Michael calls looking for Helen, causing Carol to cut the wire of the telephone.

The landlord arrives to collect Carol and Helen&#x27;s rent. After he is unable to get in due to the barricade, he breaks into the apartment and sees Carol. She pays him the rent, but he is disgusted by the state of the apartment. He sees the uncooked rabbit, still sitting out, rotting. He propositions Carol, offering to forget about the rent if she &quot;takes care of him&quot;, and tries to rape her when she does not respond. She pushes him off and then hacks him to death with Michael&#x27;s straight razor. She then sinks deeper into hallucination.

When Helen and Michael arrive home, Helen is dismayed at the state of the place. Michael happens on Helen hyperventilating and finds Colin&#x27;s dead body in the bath. Helen finds Carol under her bed in a catatonic state. Her neighbours flood in as Michael picks her up and carries her out, smiling. In the living room, a family photo—the one Carol pondered earlier—shows Carol as a child, possibly staring at an older male family member in the photograph with a look of loathing, while others in the photo smile for the camera.

==Analysis==
The film is unusual for featuring a female killer. It explores the repulsion Carol feels about sexuality in general and her suitors&#x27; pursuit of her in particular.

It has been suggested that the film hints that her father may have sexually abused her as a child, which is the basis of her neuroses and breakdown. Other critics have observed Carol&#x27;s repeated usage of items related to her sister&#x27;s boyfriend Michael, and his presence greatly provoking Carol at the beginning of the film.

The film also approaches the theme of boundary breaking, with Tamar McDonald stating that she saw Carol as refusing to conform to the expected &quot;path of femininity&quot;. It increasingly adopts the perspective of its protagonist. The dream sequences are particularly intense.

Repulsion was considered the first instalment in Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Apartment Trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976), both of which are horror films that also take place primarily inside apartment buildings.

==Production==
===Development===
The story for &quot;Repulsion&quot; was conceived by Roman Polanski and Gérard Brach, who wrote an outline of the script in Paris. Polanski, who had recently relocated from his native Poland to the United Kingdom, decided to set the film in London. According to Polanski, the inspiration for the screenplay was derived from a woman of whom he and Brach were mutual acquaintances, and who Polanski later learned suffered from schizophrenia.

Polanski and Brach pitched the film to numerous English studios, including British Lion Films and Paramount Pictures, but each passed on the project. They eventually proposed the project to Compton Films, a small English-based studio known for making exploitation films and softcore pornography. The two leading executives at Compton Films, Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser, were impressed by the screenplay, and agreed to help produce and distribute the film.

===Casting===
Deneuve, who had just finished a starring role in Umbrellas of Cherbourg the year before, was cast in the lead role of Carol.

===Filming===
According to Polanski, the film was shot on a modest budget of £65,000. The film&#x27;s exterior sequences were shot in the South Kensington district of London, while interiors of Carol and Helen&#x27;s mansion flat were constructed on a small lot at Twickenham Studios. In order to capture an authentic appearance the film&#x27;s art director, Seamus Flannery, and the cinematographer, Gilbert Taylor, photographed the interiors of a number of real local flats shared by young women in a seedy section of South Kensington. Commenting on the appearance of the flat, Polanski biographer Christopher Sandford notes: &quot;Unlike the usual heavy-handed representation of a London pad, the detail and observations of the place are exactly right; you can believe that two foreign girls would end up there.&quot;

Filming was challenging for Polanski as he was unfamiliar with the London shooting locations, and both he and star Deneuve were not fluent in English. Additionally, Polanski was meticulous about shots: Michael Klinger recalled witnessing Polanski shoot a simple frame of Deneuve&#x27;s hand twenty-seven times. The production eventually went over-budget, partly due to Polanski&#x27;s perfectionistic tendencies, totaling approximately £95,000 as opposed to the budgeted £65,000.

Tensions flared between Polanski and some of the cast during the shoot, including Yvonne Furneaux, whom Polanski treated harshly. Klinger recounted that, after remonstrating with Polanski for his treatment of Furneaux, he responded: &quot;I know she&#x27;s a nice girl. She&#x27;s too bloody nice. She&#x27;s supposed to be playing a bitch. Every day I have to make her into a bitch.&quot; Additionally, Ian Hendry, who portrayed Michael, would frequently return to the set after lunch intoxicated, making him difficult to direct.

== Soundtrack ==
The film was scored by Chico Hamilton. The official &quot;soundtrack&quot; was issued on CD in 2008 by British label Harkit, which specialised in British soundtracks from the 60&#x27;s. Some songs on the soundtrack are not even heard in the film, such as &quot;Seduction in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Repulsion Nocturne.&quot;

The main track from the film is called &quot;Carol&#x27;s Walk&quot;. The song also features on Hamilton&#x27;s album &quot;Chic Chic Chico&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Repulsion&quot; had its theatrical debut in London on 10 June 1965.

===Critical response===
Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review stating, &quot;An absolute knockout of a movie in the psychological horror line has been accomplished by Roman Polanski in his first English-language film.&quot; Jim Emerson, filling in for Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, included the film in his list entitled &quot;102 Movies You Must See Before...&quot;.

Upon the film&#x27;s release to DVD, Dave Kehr reviewed the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; praising the film&#x27;s techniques and themes, saying, &quot;Mr. Polanski uses slow camera movements, a soundtrack carefully composed of distracting, repetitive noises (clocks ticking, bells ringing, hearts thumping) and, once Carol barricades herself in the cramped, dark apartment, explicitly expressionistic effects (cracks suddenly ripping through walls, rough hands reaching out of the darkness to grope her) to depict a plausible schizophrenic episode.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 95% of 64 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 8.87/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;Roman Polanski&#x27;s first English film follows a schizophrenic woman&#x27;s descent into madness, and makes the audience feel as claustrophobic as the character.&quot; As of June 2019, the film is number 52 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; list of best rated films. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 91 based on 8 reviews.

===Accolades===
At the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965, &quot;Repulsion&quot; won both the FIPRESCI Prize and the Silver Berlin Bear-Extraordinary Jury Prize. The film was also nominated for a BAFTA for Best Black and White Cinematography.

===Home media===
In 2009, the film was released as part of The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray. Both releases contain two documentary featurettes, audio commentary by Roman Polanski and Catherine Deneuve, original trailers, and a 16-page booklet.

<doc id="1001151" wikidata="Q1335434" url="?curid=1001151" title="Xu Caihou">
<text>Xu Caihou (; June 1943 – 15 March 2015) was a Chinese general in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the country&#x27;s top military council. As vice chairman of the CMC, he was one of the top ranking officers of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. He also held a seat on the 25-member Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party between 2007 and 2012.

Born to a working-class family in Liaoning province, Xu spent much of his earlier career in northeastern China. He moved to Beijing in 1990 to become political commissar of the 16th Group Army, later serving as editor of the PLA&#x27;s flagship newspaper, the &quot;PLA Daily&quot;. In 1996 Xu became political commissar of the Jinan Military Region. He became vice chairman of the CMC in September 2004. He retired from office in March 2013.

In March 2014, Xu was detained and put under investigation on suspicion of bribery in one of the highest profile corruption investigations in PLA history. In June 2014, Xu was expelled from the Communist Party. Xu allegedly accumulated massive wealth by routinely demanding large bribes for the promotion of officers under him during his time as vice chairman of the CMC. Xu was undergoing legal proceedings and facing a court martial but charges were dropped after he died of bladder cancer in March 2015.

==Early life and education==
Xu was born in 1943 to a working-class family in the town of Wafangdian, Liaoning province; his parents were factory workers. He attended No. 8 Middle School in present-day Dalian. He achieved high scores on his &quot;Gaokao&quot; exams and was admitted to the elite Harbin Military Engineering Institute in Harbin, where he studied electrical engineering. The institute was a feeder school for the army, and produced many graduates who later went on to become high-ranking officers in the PLA. In April 1966, just prior to the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xu Caihou, along with all the students attending the institute, were mandated by the government to leave the military to take on civilian jobs.

Xu graduated in 1968, in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, and was sent to the countryside to perform manual agricultural labour for over a year on a military-run farm in Tangyuan County in China&#x27;s northeastern hinterlands. Subsequently, due to his being of proletarian class background (his parents were factory workers), he was allowed the &#x27;privilege&#x27; of re-joining the army. Xu enlisted in the spring of 1970 as an officer cadet and was stationed in Jilin province. After joining the officer corps, it took him four years to earn his first promotion.

==Career==
After the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was eager to promote young university graduates as part of his military-reform program. Most of the commanding officers of the PLA at the time had only informal or middle school-level education. Beginning in 1982, Xu earned a series of quick promotions. Xu served in Jilin province for much of his early career, generally in roles that facilitated military-political relations.

Xu became the political commissar of the 16th Group Army in 1990 and was promoted to major general shortly thereafter. In an incident upon moving to Beijing for work, Xu was offered an air conditioner to cope with the city&#x27;s summer heat, as a gift from a classmate in university. He reportedly refused the offer, on the grounds that he did not want to have a privilege that his superior officer, who was managing without an air conditioner, lacked.

Next, Xu served as the chief editor of the &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot; newspaper; he stayed on the role for just over a year, being promoted again to lieutenant general in the process. In 1996, he became the political commissar of the Jinan Military Region, with a vast area of jurisdiction over military units in several eastern Chinese provinces. Xu&#x27;s mission in facilitating &quot;political affairs&quot; in the military meant that, in practice, he was in charge of the promotion and performance evaluation of army officers.

===Central Military Commission===

In 1999, Xu was promoted to the rank of General (&quot;Shang Jiang&quot;), the highest non-wartime rank in the PLA, and also joined the Central Military Commission, in addition to taking charge of the General Political Department (GPD) as its executive deputy head. In December 2000 he was named the head of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission, the military&#x27;s anti-graft and disciplinary enforcement body. Xu&#x27;s ascendancy in the military also resulted in his rise in the Communist Party&#x27;s political hierarchy. In November 2002, he assumed full leadership over the GPD. At the party&#x27;s 16th National Congress in 2002, Xu became a member of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, a body in charge of the implementation of party policy.

Xu&#x27;s rapid promotions at around the turn of the century were attributed to the support given to him by then-Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin. Observers believe that through Xu, Jiang continued to influence affairs in the military despite his official retirement in 2004; some retired officers simply described Xu and his partner of equal rank Guo Boxiong as &quot;Jiang&#x27;s proxy in the military.&quot;

During his term as Central Military Commission vice chairman, beginning in September 2004, Xu wielded significant authority over personnel decisions in the upper echelons of the military. Xu was seen by some observers as the day-to-day executive authority in the upper military ranks because CCP General Secretary and Central Military Chairman Hu Jintao, nominally Xu&#x27;s superior, took a relatively hands-off approach to military affairs. In 2007, he was named to the 25-member Politburo, being elected at the 1st Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee. Xu retired from the Politburo in 2012 and the Central Military Commission in 2013.

==Corruption allegations==

According to numerous reports in Chinese and international media, the practice of exchanging &quot;cash for ranks&quot; was widespread during Xu&#x27;s term as vice chairman; the practice was ostensibly common from the highest-ranking officers to the rank-and-file petty officers. According to sources in the army, Xu&#x27;s power during his CMC Vice Chairmanship was largely unchecked, they cited an example where one officer attempted to bribe Xu with ten million yuan to secure a higher rank, another officer &#x27;outbid&#x27; the first one with twenty million yuan (~$3.2 million), so Xu annulled the arrangement with the first officer. Other accusations suggested that during Xu&#x27;s term in office, an implicit set of prices were attached to each rank in the army as well as other &#x27;privileges&#x27; such as party membership.

It was reported in March 2014 that Xu, then aged 70, had been diagnosed with bladder cancer and was undergoing extensive treatment at the 301 Military Hospital in Beijing. A corruption probe was opened at around the same time. There was speculation among some in the military that Xu would be &#x27;spared&#x27; charges due to his ill-health. Gu Junshan, one of Xu&#x27;s allegedly favorite officers, who was promoted during Xu&#x27;s years in office, had already been under investigation for a wide-reaching corruption scandal involving the military&#x27;s real estate assets.

Xu&#x27;s supporters, pleading for clemency, said that having terminal cancer was akin to having already received the &quot;death penalty,&quot; citing the precedent of former Vice Premier Huang Ju as a case where corruption charges should not be pressed against an official in ill-health. The decision to investigate Xu was reportedly made on 15 March 2014, when Xu was taken from his hospital bed by armed policemen. His wife, daughter and former secretary were also reportedly taken into custody.

At a Chinese New Year gala for retired military officials in 2014, Xu reportedly tried to speak to Xi Jinping, who is the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, several times, without success.

===Expulsion from the party===
Xu was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party on 30 June 2014. State media described Xu&#x27;s crimes as abuse of power, accepting bribes directly or via family members in exchange for promotions, and advancing the interests of those close to him through the powers vested in his office.

Xu&#x27;s downfall was unexpected because corruption investigations involving mid-tier military officers are rarely publicly announced in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as to not compromise national security. Such an announcement involving a high-ranking general was entirely unprecedented. Xu became the highest-ranked officer in the history of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army to be investigated in corruption. During the investigation into Xu, investigators found over one tonne of cash in his Beijing home, along with precious gems, ancient artifacts, and artwork. It was said that much of the cash was still stowed away neatly in boxes marked with the names of individual officers, and that it took 12 trucks to transport all the materials confiscated from his home.

Some analysts believe that Xu&#x27;s downfall signaled a consolidation of military power directly under the hands of Xi Jinping and is of greater political significance than the corruption investigation surrounding Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee. His downfall had been presented by the Communist Party as part of a wider campaign by Xi Jinping to eradicate corruption and reform the military. In October 2014, Xu was reported to have confessed to taking bribes, becoming the highest-profile figure in China&#x27;s military to be caught up in Xi Jinping&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign.

==Death==
Xu died on 15 March 2015, from bladder cancer and multiple organ failure at the 301 Military Hospital in Beijing at the age of 71, likely during the annual &quot;two sessions&quot; (&quot;Lianghui&quot;) meeting of China&#x27;s legislature and legislative advisory body. There is some speculation that his death was not announced until the conclusion of &quot;Lianghui&quot; on 15 March to avoid distracting from the proceedings of the nation&#x27;s pre-eminent annual political gathering. As a result of his death, military prosecutors announced that, &quot;in accordance with legal procedures,&quot; they will not continue to pursue charges against him, despite having already filed suit in military court, but will continue work in investigating his &quot;ill-gotten gains&quot;.

<text>Schaan (; dialectal: &quot;Schaa&quot;) is the largest municipality of Liechtenstein by population. It is located to the north of Vaduz, the capital, in the central part of the country. it has a population of 6,039, making it the most populous administrative district in Liechtenstein. Representing an important traffic hub and industrial location of the country, Schaan covers an area of , including mountains and forest. It is a municipality within the electoral district of Oberland in the Principality of Liechtenstein. Schaan contains four exclaves: Brunnenegg, Gritsch, Guschg, and Plankner Neugrütt.

==History==

Recent archaeological finds have shown that Schaan has been inhabited for over 6,000 years: In the year 15 BC, the Romans, under Augustus, conquered the territory of the present Principality of Liechtenstein and established the Roman province of Raetia. In the 1st century AD, a military road was built from Milan to Bregenz, running along the Luzisteig on the right bank of the Rhine. This led to the building of settlements in modern-day Schaan. In 1887, two Roman legionnaire&#x27;s helmets were found buried during digging work above Dux. Bearing the engraved names of the legionaries &quot;Publius Cavidius Felix&quot; and &quot;Numerius Pomponius&quot; and dated to the 1st century AD, it is likely that they were intended as a variety of commemoration of the two men. They are now housed in the museums of Bregenz and Zurich. 

The most important Roman building on the territory of the municipality is a fort built in the valley, whose purpose was to afford protection against the ever more frequent Alemannic invasions. Remains of its foundations and the gate tower are again visible from St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Schaan. A 5th century baptistery was found during excavations inside this church, suggesting early Christianization. During excavations there, traces of a prehistoric settlement were also found.

The Alemannic settlement is evidenced by numerous grave finds. At that time Schaan consisted of two separate parts. The Romanized Räter-people had their centre at St. Peter, while the Alemannic population settled in the area of Specki. This dichotomy can still be seen today in the existence of two alpine cooperatives, the North-Alemannic cooperative Gritsch and the southern Rhaeto-Roman cooperative Guschg.

== Administration ==
Schaan is locally administered by the mayor and a 12-person municipal council, elected every four years since 1975. The incumbent mayor is Daniel Hilti, since 2003.

==Geography==

Schaan is the northernmost municipality in the Liechtenstein Oberland. It is bordered to the south by the capital, Vaduz, to the east by Planken and Triesenberg, and to the north by the municipalities of Eschen and Gamprin. In the west, the Rhine forms the natural border with Switzerland, and in the east, the town is dominated by the Drei Schwestern mountain range. Schaan also has four exclaves within other municipalities, and two enclaves within its primary municipality. Because of this, Schaan borders Austria in three separate locations.

==Transport==

It is situated on the international and electrified Feldkirch-Buchs line, between the station of Buchs SG (in Switzerland) and the stop of Forst Hilti (in the northern suburb of Schaan). It is served only by regional trains.

===Schaan Forst Hilti railway station===
The station is served by eighteen trains per day, nine in each direction between Switzerland and Austria. It is located in front of the Hilti Corporation&#x27;s headquarters, on the outskirts of Schaan.

<text>John Devereux, 1st Baron Devereux, (1337 – 22 February 1393), was a close companion of Edward, the Black Prince, and an English peer during the reign of King Richard II.

==Birth and Ancestry==

John Devereux of Whitchurch Maund was the son of John Devereux of Manne (Maune or Maund, Bodenham) and his wife Margaret Barre. His father came of age in 1323, and fought at the Battle of Crécy. His great-grandfather was William Devereux through his first wife Alice Grandison, and this William was called to Parliament as &#x27;Lord Deverois&#x27; on 6 February 1299.

Rising debt related to the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth led Baron William Devereux to financial arrangements permitting the alienation of Lyonshall Castle, the caput of the Barony. His grandson, Stephen Devereux of Bodenham and Burghope seized the castle by force in 1305 and brought suit for its return, but his plea was denied, as his grandfather was still alive. Stephen would never regain Lyonshall in his lifetime, nor would he inherit the title upon William’s death. His younger brother, John Devereux of Manne and son, William Devereux of Bodenham, remained close throughout their lifetime united in their desire to regain their lost patrimony. John Devereux of Whitchurch Maund would carry on this alliance with his cousin, William, and William&#x27;s son, Walter Devereux of Bodenham. As John Devereux of Whitchurch Maund regained royal favour, he promoted the advancement of his cousin’s grandson, Walter Devereux of Weobley, at court.

The ancestral arms of the Devereux family, and that of the Devereux of Bodenham were: &quot;Argent, a fesse and in chief three roundlets gules&quot;. To distinguish themselves, the Devereux family of Whitchurch Maund added a &quot;mullet or&quot;.

==Career==

A renowned soldier, he began his campaigns when he joined the expedition of Bertrand du Guesclin to assist Don Enrique of Trastamara against Pedro the Cruel, King of Castile. He was recalled in 1366 by the Prince of Wales, but joined Edward, the Black Prince, when he led an expedition to Spain in 1367 to restore the now deposed King Pedro of Castile, and John Devereux distinguished himself at the victorious Battle of Nájera in northern Castile on 3 April 1367.

Prince Edward returned to Aquitaine, where he made himself unpopular with the nobility by levying taxes to pay for his Spanish expedition. John Devereux was fighting again beside him in Gascony (1368) when the province rose in revolt against the Prince, and was present in September 1370 when Edward besieged the city of Limoges and massacred 3,000 inhabitants at its fall. He was appointed Seneschal of Limousin in 1369/70, and in 1372 Seneschal of La Rochelle.
After the Black Prince returned to England in 1371, John Devereux (already a knight by this time) served under Guy de Bryan, 1st Baron Bryan, on a naval expedition in June 1371. Devereux campaigned in France during 1372, and was taken prisoner when the English were defeated by Bertrand du Guesclin at the Battle of Chizé on 21 March 1373 in Poitou. After being ransomed he was serving in the summer of 1373 in the retinue of John, Duke of Lancaster. In 1375 Devereux was back campaigning in Brittany with the Duke of Brittany (The Duke later, 1379 or 1380, granted him 100 marks a year for life). John Devereux served again under the Duke of Lancaster as Lieutenant/Sub-captain to Sir Aubrey de Vere in a naval expedition in 1378. He campaigned further in France in 1379 and 1380.

Edward, the Black Prince died on 8 June 1376, probably from an illness contracted in Spain, and was buried in great splendour in Canterbury Cathedral. Based on instructions provided by the Black Prince on his deathbed, on 20 May 1377 John Devereux was granted 200 marks a year for life for his services in Spain and Guyenne. Edward’s young son, Richard II, succeeded Edward III a year later, and John Devereux was selected for the Continual Council on 20 July 1377 to rule during Richard’s minority (ended in 1388). 

John Devereux was sheriff of Herefordshire in 1376. He was appointed Constable of Leeds Castle in Kent (1 March 1377/8), Captain of Calais (17 January 1379/80), and supervisor of the castles and fortalices in the parts of Calais and Guînes (17 April 1381). John served as a Commissioner to treat with the King of France on 20 May and 16 December 1381, 4 November 1383, 22 January 1385/6, 26 November 1388, and 8 April 1390. John Devereux was a Commissioner to treat with the Count of Flanders on 1 June and 4 November 1383, 26 November 1388, and 8 April 1390. From 12 March 1387/8 to 1392 he was Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and from February 1387/8 until his death Steward of the King’s Household.

==Marriage==

He married about 1377 Margaret de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford, and Maud de Badlesmere, as her third husband. They had two children: John Devereux (2nd Baron Devereux) about 1378, and Joan Devereux (3rd Baroness Devereux and Baroness FitzWalter) in 1380. John Devereux had at least one illegitimate son before 1385 for whom he made in his Will an allowance of 100 marks for his marriage.

Margaret de Vere had been married previously to Henry, 3rd Baron Beaumont, who had died on 25 July 1369. She had married a second time to Sir Nicholas Louvain of Penshurst in Kent who had died in 1375. She would survive John Devereux as well. Her widow’s dower was assigned 25 Feb. 1393/4, and she died on 15 June 1398.

==Elevation to Peerage and Honours==

John Devereux was created a knight bachelor before 1377. He was subsequently summoned to Parliament on 28 September 1384 as Lord (Baron) Devereux. Although his great-grandfather William Devereux had been summoned to parliament as &quot;Lord Devereux&quot; on 6 February 1299, this is considered as a new creation as none of the intervening generations between his death in 1314 and this creation in 1384 assumed the title or possessed the financial resources to support a barony.

John Devereux was further honoured on 10 September 1385 by his creation as a knight banneret and placement at the Standard, and honoured still further by his creation as a Knight of the Order of the Garter in April 1389. His arms are described as &quot;argent, a fesse gules, in chief three torteaux&quot; with a &quot;mullet or.&quot;
His son, John Devereux, 2nd Baron Devereux, died without heirs, and the title passed to his daughter Joan, 3rd Baroness Devereux and Baroness FitzWalter. Upon her death, the Barony was absorbed into her children&#x27;s title Baron FitzWalter.

==Principal Landholdings==

He acquired for life (with remainders to his wife and two children) licences on 24 Mar. 1381/2 and 11 April 1382 for the priories of Frampton, Panfield, and Wells from the Abbey of St. Etienne at Caen, and the priory of Newent from the Abbey of Cormeilles paying yearly 246&quot;L&quot; 13s 4d to the Exchequer. In November 1385 he purchased Kilpeck Castle for the life of Elizabeth (part of her dower lands), wife of Robert, Earl of Hereford. He acquired the manor of Penhurst in Kent by right of his wife in 1387, and was granted permission to embattle it on 21 September 1392.
In 1388 with the exile of Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, and execution of Simon de Burley, Lyonshall Castle and manor was forfeited to the crown. On 9 December 1390 John Devereux was granted Lyonshall Castle and manor with a reference to a previous agreement between Burley and Devereux
. This castle had been held by the Devereux family until alienated at the death of William Devereux in 1314. Shortly after regaining Lyonshall, John Devereux contracted on 18 February 1391 with a mason from Hereford to repair and improve it.

He possessed at death Lyonshall Castle, Dorstone Castle, and Whitechurch Maund (Bodenham) in Herefordshire; Donnington in Berkshire; Penshurst in Kent; and Dinton in Bucks.

==Death==

John Devereux died suddenly on 22 Feb. 1392/3, and was buried in the Church of the Grey Friars in London. His Will was dated June 1385 with codicil 22 Feb. 1392/3, proved 23 Feb 1392/3 at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. He had directed that 40 marks be paid &quot;pur mon sepulture&quot; and was recorded as having one of the most stately funerals with provisions for tapers and torchbearers. His will directed that &quot;6 tapers, in the form of a cross be placed on his hearse, and that 6 men, clothed in white, bear 6 torches, and that each of the men should receive eleven pence for his pains; that every poor man at his burial to have one penny to pray for his soul, and for all Christian souls; to the Grey Friars, for his burial there, XI marks. As soon as possible after his death he ordered that 1000 masses be said for his soul, and for the souls of his father and mother. To Margaret, his wife, he gave four dozen silver dishes and six chargers of silver; but after her death the same were to belong to John, her son, and in the event of his death to Joan, his (testator’s) daughter&quot;.

<text>Ashwood is a small area of Staffordshire, England.

It is situated in the South Staffordshire district, approximately two miles west of the West Midlands conurbation and the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. Population details for the 2011 census can be found under Kinver.

There are a small number of predominantly older scattered houses in it, as well as a marina off the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. There is no nucleated village.

More built-up nearby areas include Kingswinford, Stourbridge, Kinver and Wolverhampton. The nearest public amenities are approximately one mile away in Wall Heath village.

==History==
Ashwood was formerly an area of medieval woodland and later heathland, bounded by the Smestow Brook, the River Stour, and cultivated lands in Kingswinford. It was one of the medieval hays (enclosures) of Kinver Forest. It was managed by a bailiff, who had a small farm at Prestwood by the service of keeping the hay. The hay stretched north to Wall Heath and east into what is now part of the built up area of Kingswinford and Wordsley.

Domesday Book records it as the manor of Haswic, which was waste on account of the forest. Previously there had been a village in a manor belonging to the priests of Wolverhampton. This may in turn have succeeded a Roman settlement, occupying the site of Greensforge Roman fort.

The heath was inclosed mainly as three open fields in the 1680s, on the basis of long leases granted to the commoners, and again by Act of Parliament (Parliamentary inclosure) when the leases expired in the 1780s. The whole of Ashwood was then part of Kingswinford parish, but the rural part of it was transferred to Kinver parish in the 1930s, when the rest of Kingswinford was transferred to Brierley Hill Urban District.

The marina occupies the site of Flatheridge pool. It was made as a canal basin, where coal brought down a railway from Pensnett could be loaded into canal barges.

<text>Mental health law includes a wide variety of legal topics and pertain to people with a diagnosis or possible diagnosis of a mental health condition, and to those involved in managing or treating such people. Laws that relate to mental health include:

*employment laws, including laws that prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of a mental health condition, require reasonable accommodations in the workplace, and provide mental health-related leave;
*insurance laws, including laws governing mental health coverage by medical insurance plans, disability insurance, workers compensation, and Social Security Disability Insurance;
*housing laws, including housing discrimination and zoning;
*education laws, including laws that prohibit discrimination, and laws that require reasonable accommodations, equal access to programs and services, and free appropriate public education;
*laws that provide a right to treatment; 
*involuntary commitment and guardianship laws; 
*laws governing treatment professionals, including licensing laws, confidentiality, informed consent, and medical malpractice; 
*laws governing admission of expert testimony or other psychiatric evidence in court; and
*criminal laws, including laws governing fitness for trial or execution, and the insanity defense.
Mental health law has received relatively little attention in scholarly legal forums. The University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law in 2011 announced the formation of a student-edited law journal entitled &quot;Mental Health Law &amp; Policy Journal.&quot;

==United States==

===Employment===
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (&quot;ADA&quot;) is a civil rights law that protects individuals with depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (&quot;PTSD&quot;), and other mental health conditions in the workplace. It prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from firing, refusing to hire, or taking other adverse actions against a job applicant or employee based on real or perceived mental health conditions. It also strictly limits the circumstances under which an employer can ask for information about medical conditions, including mental health conditions, and imposes confidentiality requirements on any medical information that the employer does have.

The ADA also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants or employees with mental health conditions under some circumstances. A reasonable accommodation is a special arrangement or piece of equipment that a person needs because of a medical condition to apply for a job, do a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment. Examples include a flexible schedule, changes in the method of supervision, and permission to work from home. To have the right to a reasonable accommodation, the worker&#x27;s mental health condition must meet the ADA&#x27;s definition of a &quot;current disability.&quot; Conditions that should easily qualify include major depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (&quot;OCD&quot;), and schizophrenia. Other conditions may also qualify, depending on what the symptoms would be if the condition were left untreated, during an active episode (if the condition involves active episodes). The symptoms do not need to be severe or permanent for the condition to be a disability under the ADA.

Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), certain employees are entitled to up to twelve weeks of job-protected and unpaid leave to recover from a serious illness or to care for a family member with a serious illness, among other reasons. To be eligible, the employer must have had 50 or more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year, or else must be a public agency, elementary school, or secondary school, and the employee must have worked for the employer for at least
12 months, must have at least 1,250 hours of service for the employer during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and must work at a location where the employer has at least 50 employees within 75 miles.

== United Kingdom ==
Various pieces of legislation including Mental Health Act 1983 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 govern mental health law giving mental health professionals the ability to commit individuals, treat them without consent and place restrictions on them while in public through outpatient commitment, according to the rules of this legislation. These decisions can be challenged through the mental health tribunals which contain members of the judiciary, though the initial decisions are made by mental health professionals alone.

==Around the world==

===Civil commitment===
Mental health legislation is largely used in the management of psychiatric disorders, such as dementia or psychosis, and developmental disabilities where a person does not possess the ability to act in a legally competent manner and requires treatment and/or another person to act in his or her best interests. The laws generally cover the requirements and procedures for involuntary commitment and compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital or other facility.

In some jurisdictions, court orders are required for compulsory treatment; in others, psychiatrists may treat compulsorily by following set procedures, usually with means of appeal or regular scrutiny to ensure compliance with the law such as through mental health tribunals.

===Sources of law===
Mental health law includes areas of both civil and criminal common and statutory law.

Common law is based on long-standing English legal principles, as interpreted through case law. Mental health-related legal concepts include mens rea, insanity defences; legal definitions of &quot;sane,&quot; &quot;insane,&quot; and &quot;incompetent;&quot; informed consent; and automatism, amongst many others.

Statutory law usually takes the form of a mental health statute. An example is the Mental Health Act 1983 in England and Wales. These acts codify aspects of the treatment of mental illness and provides rules and procedures to be followed and penalties for breaches.

Not all countries have mental health acts. The World Health Report (2001) lists the following percentages, by region, for countries with and without mental health legislation.

<text>is a district of Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto, Japan, originating as an entertainment district in the Sengoku period, in front of Yasaka Shrine (Gion Shrine). The district was built to accommodate the needs of travellers and visitors to the shrine. It eventually evolved to become one of the most exclusive and well-known geisha districts in all of Japan. Gion is the Japanese translation (via Chinese &quot;Qiyuan&quot;) of the Buddhist term Jetavana. Yasaka Shrine, located in this district is the center of the Gion faith. 

The geisha in Kyoto do not refer to themselves as geisha, instead using the local term . While the term geisha means &quot;artist&quot; or &quot;person of the arts&quot;, the more direct term means essentially &quot;a woman of art&quot;.

==Divisions==
Gion houses two , or geisha districts: and . The two were originally the same district, but split many years ago. Gion Kobu is larger, occupying most of the district including the famous street Hanamikoji, while Gion Higashi is smaller and occupies the northeast corner, centered on its rehearsal hall. Despite the considerable decline in the number of geisha in Gion in the last century, the area is still famous for the preservation of forms of traditional architecture and entertainment.

Part of this district has been declared a national historical preservation district. The City of Kyoto has undertaken a number of restorative projects to enhance the beauty and historical authenticity of Kyoto&#x27;s , such as relocating overhead utilities underground. Since 1986, the city has removed electric poles from a number of popular tourist destinations such as Nene no Michi (ねねの道), Hanamikoji (花見小路), and Pontocho (先斗町).

==Entertainment==
===Geisha===

Gion retains a number of old-style Japanese houses called , which roughly translates to &quot;townhouse&quot;, some of which function as , or &quot;teahouses&quot;, where geisha entertain guests at parties, involving singing, traditional dance performances, drinking games and conversation. Both geisha and can be seen travelling throughout the district to attend parties, lessons and various other engagements. A number of dressing-up parlors, known as studios, will dress tourists up as or geisha for a fee, allowing them to walk through the streets of Gion and have their photo taken; by law in Kyoto, these tourists are required to dress inaccurately, so as not to impersonate geisha or .

Geisha and both perform in public dance events staged yearly, such as the Miyako Odori; some also perform dances for tourists at Gion Corner.

=== Other ===
There are also many modern entertainment establishments in Gion – restaurants, bars, clubs, pachinko, off-track betting, and a very large number of tourist-oriented establishments, particularly along Shijō Street; the region is both a major tourist hub, and a popular nightlife spot for locals. Though a number of streets are modern in construction, a number of quieter streets featuring traditional architecture also exist, such as and its environs, ranging from Shijō Street at the north end, anchored by the famous Ichiriki Tei, and running south to the major temple of Kennin-ji.

The stretch of the Shirakawa River before it enters the Kamo river is also a popular preserved area. It is lined on the south side with traditional establishments which directly face the river, and some are accessed by crossing bridges from the north side. The north side was previously also lined with buildings, but these were torn down in World War II as a fire-prevention measure, and the section is now primarily a pedestrian street, lined with cherry blossoms. These are lit up in the evening in the spring, and the area is active year-round.

==Annual events==

The geisha and of Gion both perform annual public dances, as do all five geisha districts in Kyoto. The oldest of these date to the Kyoto exhibition of 1872. The more popular of these is the Miyako Odori, literally &quot;Dances of the Old Capital&quot; (sometimes instead referred to as the &quot;Cherry Blossom Dances&quot;), staged by the geisha of Gion Kobu, which dates to 1872. The dances run from April 1 through April 30 each year during the height of the cherry blossom () season. Spectators from Japan and worldwide attend the events, which range from &quot;cheap&quot; seats on tatami mats on the floor, to reserved seats with a small tea ceremony beforehand. Gion Higashi holds a similar dance in early November, around autumn leaves, known as Gion Odori; this is more recent and has fewer performances.

==Education==
The Kyoto Municipal Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools. Gionmachi Kitagawa and Gionmachi Minamigawa are zoned to Kaisei Elementary and Junior High School (開睛小中学校).

==In popular culture==
* Gion is the setting of much of Arthur Golden&#x27;s novel &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot;
* Gion Kobu was also where Mineko Iwasaki lived and conducted business as a geisha, as mentioned in her autobiography &quot;Geisha of Gion.&quot;
* Gion is the setting of several films by Kenji Mizoguchi, including:
** 1936 
** 1953 
* Part of the Gion area is featured as a photo travel landscape in the 2010 racing video game Gran Turismo 5.

<text>Dimitrovgrad ( ) is a town in Haskovo Province, Bulgaria. It is along the Maritsa River in the Thrace region, close to the provincial capital, Haskovo. Dimitrovgrad is the administrative centre of Dimitrovgrad Municipality.

Founded in 1947, Dimitrovgrad is a planned city built by the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria following World War II. The recently established communist government designed the town as a socialist model city and a modern industrial center. Dimitrovgrad is named for the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov.

== Geography ==
It is located 220 km from the capital Sofia and 15 km from the regional town of Haskovo. The nearest Bulgarian port is Burgas - 205 km, and the Greek port of Alexandroupoli on the Aegean Sea is about 190 km. through Makaza. Dimitrovgrad is a transport hub for Pan-European corridors 4, 8 and 9.

==History==
Dimitrovgrad was planned by the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, the communist state that came to power following World War II.

Construction of the city began on May 10, 1947, with most of the labor provided by youth volunteers who arrived from around Bulgaria. The establishment of Dimitrovgrad was officially announced on 2 September 1947, by Georgi Dimitrov, the leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria. The three villages of Rakovski, Mariyno and Chernokonyovo were merged to form Dimitrovgrad. Construction of the town continued intensively for several more years.

The main practical reason behind the new city was to create a modern industrial centre for Bulgaria. there was also an ideological foundation for building it. The widespread destruction in Eastern Europe caused by World War II and the rise of Soviet-backed communist states in the region (known as the Eastern Bloc) led to numerous cities being built or rebuilt using new socialist planning styles. The original buildings in Dimitrovgrad were built in architectural styles popularly known as &quot;Soviet Empire&quot; or &quot;Stalin Baroque&quot;, with facades of the earliest often monumental, with plinths, large columns and small decorative balconies. Over time, as the town expanded, buildings were built featuring less ornamentation in the newer Modernist architectural style.

In 1970, the first celebration of the national poetry festival &#x27;Penio Penev&#x27; took place, and that tradition continues to the present. In 1980, the biennial Bulgarian theatrical poster was held for the first time. In 1987, the museum house Penio Penev was opened.

In 1992, shortly after the collapse of communism in Bulgaria, the monument to Georgi Dimitrov was removed by the authorities. This move proved very unpopular with the local residents, and in 2012 a plan was adopted by Dimitrovgrad city council to restore the statue and re-mount it by 2013. So far this has not happened.

==Tourism==

Architecture in Dimitrovgrad is similar to that of the Roman Empire: It has spacious streets and large parks. It is one of the greenest cities in Bulgaria. There are three large parks with about 15 lakes, dozens of species of rare trees, shrubs and flowers, sculptures, gazebos and fountains. The town is also home to the People&#x27;s Astronomical Observatory and Planetarium &quot;Jordano Bruno&quot;. This is the first planetarium and second observatory (after the one in Stara Zagora) in Bulgaria 

== Population ==
The population of Dimitrovgrad during the first decade after its foundation averaged about 34,000. In the following decades it started growing, mostly because of migrants from rural areas, reaching its peak between 1985 and 1992, when it exceeded 50,000. Since then, particularly during the 1990s, the population declined rapidly due to the poor economic situation in the region that lead to a new migration to the country&#x27;s capital Sofia and abroad.

<text>Harry Summerfield Hoff (4 August 1910 – 5 September 2002) was an English novelist, writing under the name William Cooper.

==Life==
H. S. Hoff (William Cooper) was born in Crewe, the son of elementary school teachers, and attended Crewe County Secondary School before reading natural sciences at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1933 he was a teacher in Leicester, an experience on which he seems to have drawn for his novel, &quot;Scenes from Provincial Life.&quot; Hoff served in the Signals Branch of the Royal Air Force in World War II, and later became a civil servant, associating closely with C. P. Snow, who appears in light disguise as Robert in &quot;Scenes from Provincial Life&quot; and its sequels. Amongst his appointments he worked for the UK Atomic Energy Authority and the Crown Agents. After retiring he held an academic position with Syracuse University, New York, lecturing on English literature to its students in London.

Hoff wrote four novels between 1934 and 1946 under his own name but made his reputation with his first novel under the pen name William Cooper (used from then on), &quot;Scenes from Provincial Life&quot; (1950), the first of five more or less autobiographical novels published over the ensuing half century. It was hailed at once by writers such as Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgess and John Braine who wrote: &quot;This book was for me – and I suspect many others –- a seminal influence&quot; Deceptively simple in style and both comic and lyrical in tone, the novel tells of events in the lives of its narrator, Joe Lunn, a grammar school physics teacher; his girlfriend Myrtle, who wants him to marry her; his friend Tom, with whom he plans to emigrate to the USA; and various other characters in an English provincial town in the spring and summer of 1939. The novel&#x27;s naturalism was a conscious rejection of the earlier modernist tradition of the English novel, which Hoff called the &quot;Art Novel&quot;. Malcolm Bradbury wrote of it that &#x27;a good part of the literary styles and temper of the 1950s was set by this book.&#x27;

There followed, in order of writing, &quot;Scenes from Metropolitan Life&quot;, &quot;Scenes from Married Life&quot; (1961), &quot;Scenes from Later Life&quot; (1983) and &quot;Scenes from Death and Life&quot; (1999). &quot;Scenes from Metropolitan Life&quot;, although written in the mid-50s, remained unpublished until 1982, for legal reasons: the real-life prototype for the character of Myrtle, central to the novel, had threatened to sue if it were published. &quot;Scenes from Death and Life&quot;, his last published work, was turned down by Hoff&#x27;s publisher Macmillan and was issued by a small independent company.

Hoff wrote 17 novels in all as well as short stories, two plays and a biography of his friend C. P. Snow. In 1971 he published an account of the trial of the two Hosein brothers, found guilty in 1970 of the kidnapping and murder of Muriel McKay, whom they had abducted in the belief that she was the wife of Rupert Murdoch. His fictional works were invariably optimistic and often outright comic, but with an understated sympathy for those dealing with the problems of ordinary life. He had a straightforward and uncensorious attitude to the sex lives of his characters and a respect for the young, which gave even his later novels a freshness and a contemporary resonance.

In 1951 Hoff married Joyce Harris, the model for the central character of &quot;Scenes from Married Life&quot;, who died in 1988. They had two daughters.

<doc id="1001191" wikidata="Q314368" url="?curid=1001191" title="Diomansy Kamara">
<text>Diomansy Mehdi Moustapha Kamara (born 8 November 1980) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Born in Paris, France, he played internationally for Senegal, whom he represented at three Africa Cup of Nations.

During a 17-year professional career, Kamara played for football clubs in Italy, England, Scotland, Turkey and India as well as France.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Paris, Kamara grew up in Gennevilliers. He began his professional career with Red Star 93 before joining Catanzaro during the 1999–2000 season.

He made 34 league appearances and scored nine times for the Calabrian club before signing for Modena. In three seasons there, he scored 15 times in 82 appearances, impressing many with his speed and agility.

===Portsmouth===
In August 2004, Portsmouth wanted to sign Kamara for a loan deal but eventually signed him for £2.5 million for a permanent transfer, making him their then record signing. However, despite a bright start, Kamara struggled for form and injuries during the 2004–05 season, and after just one year at Portsmouth they took advantage of a clause in his contract which allowed them to move him on to West Bromwich Albion whilst only paying £1 million of his initial transfer fee to Modena. Albion paid £1.5 million for Kamara.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Kamara made his Albion debut on 13 August 2005, replacing Kanu in the 60th minute in a 0–0 draw away at Manchester City. He picked up a yellow card in each of his first three games for the club. His first goal for West Brom was scored in a 4–1 Hawthorns win over Bradford City in the League Cup, on 20 September 2005. It was one of only two goals scored by Kamara during 2005–06; his first league goal for the club was scored against Manchester City on 10 December 2005, Albion winning 2–0. Albion were relegated from the Premier League that season, but 2006–07 saw Kamara hit a rich vein of form, netting 23 goals in all competitions and helping Albion reach the playoff final. His goalscoring exploits earned him the &quot;Championship Player-of-the-Month&quot; award for October 2006, as well as the PFA Fans&#x27; Player-of-the-Month award for February 2007. He was also named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year and won the West Bromwich Albion &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award.

===Fulham===

On 9 July 2007, Kamara signed a four-year deal with Fulham for £6 million and the move was a club record sale from West Brom. Following his move to Fulham, he vowed that he could score &#x27;a lot of goals&#x27; in the Premier League with Fulham. He made his debut for the Cottagers in a 2–1 defeat away at Arsenal on 12 August 2007, replacing fellow debutant David Healy in the second half. Kamara scored his first goal for Fulham in a 1–0 win at Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup, on 28 August 2007. Four days later, he notched his first league goal for the Cottagers, a superb late overhead kick to earn a 3–3 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. After the match, Kamara told the club&#x27;s official website that the overhead kick goal was &quot;classed the goal as possibly the best of his career&quot;. On 25 November 2007, he scored his second goal, in a match against Blackburn Rovers which ended in a 2–2 draw. On 29 March 2008, he scored his third goal, against Derby County in another 2–2 draw, which resulted Derby County being relegated to the Football League. Later in the 2007–08 season, after having a relatively dry spell in front of goal, Kamara resurrected Fulham&#x27;s Premier League survival hopes with two goals in the last twenty minutes (plus a Danny Murphy rebound from a penalty saved by Joe Hart) secured a rare away win against Manchester City. Fulham eventually survived relegation, in the last game. Whilst playing for Senegal in a match against Liberia in June 2008, he ruptured his cruciate ligament, an injury which required reconstructive surgery.

In his first start for the Cottagers since his injury Kamara scored a brace against Aston Villa and also made an assist to Danny Murphy to score, helping his side win 3–1 on 9 May 2009. After the brace, manager Roy Hodgson praised Kamara&#x27;s good performance. Kamara also scored in the following match, netting the winning goal in a 1–0 over Newcastle United on 16 May 2009.

After the 2008–09 season, Kamara was linked with a move to join French Champion Bordeaux who wanted him to replace the departing Marouane Chamakh who joined Arsenal, with Roma keen to sign him as well. However, the move was rejected as Kamara was not interested in a move overseas but instead hoping to find a new club in the UK.

In the Premier League 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, Kamara began playing less in the Premier League. He scored his only league goal in the 2009–10 season for Fulham in a 2–0 victory over Hull City on 19 September 2009. On 17 September, he helped Fulham secure an away draw against CSKA Sofia which ended 1–1 in the Europa League. On 5 November 2009, Kamara scored from a penalty after being fouled in the penalty box in a match against Italian side Roma; he was substituted off in the 46th minute for Erik Nevland and Fulham went on lose with a two-goals comeback from Roma. On 1 December 2009, he suffered knee problem which kept him out for one month. He made his return for Fulham in a 2–0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur on 26 January 2010 after coming on for Zoltán Gera in the 72 minute.

====Loan to Celtic====
On 1 February 2010, Kamara moved to Celtic on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season, and Celtic had an option to make the deal permanent if he impressed during his loan stint. His move to Celtic was allowed after Fulham brought Stefano Okaka on loan from Roma. Kamara had previously played under then-Celtic manager Tony Mowbray at West Bromwich Albion. He made his debut on 2 February 2010 against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in a 1–0 defeat.
On 7 February, Kamara scored his first goal for Celtic against Dunfermline in the Scottish Cup with a strike from the edge of the box; it was also the game that provided the first Celtic goal for his strike partner Robbie Keane. On 13 February, he scored his second goal for Celtic and his first SPL goal, against Aberdeen in a 4–4 draw at Pittodrie. He also provided the assist for a goal from Keane who had assisted Kamara&#x27;s goal. On 20 February 2010, Kamara provided an assist for Keane who scored a winning goal against Dundee United in a 1–0 win. He then suffered an injury that kept him out about one month and made his return on 13 April 2010 against Motherwell in a 2–0 win. On 25 April, he scored the first of two goals in a 2–0 win against Dundee United after returning from injury.

As his loan spell was set to expire, Kamara revealed he wanted to stay at Celtic permanently and that he would happily stay on at the club under interim boss Neil Lennon after the sacking of Tony Mowbray. He revealed that he set his sights on securing a permanent deal at the club and described it as his &#x27;priority&#x27; to stay at Celtic. However the move never happened, as Celtic decided not to pay the £2.5 million buyout clause in his contract. Kamara returned to Fulham and set his sights on a move to his boyhood club PSG.

====Return to Fulham====
Upon his return to Fulham, Kamara stated that the newly appointed manager of Fulham, Mark Hughes, had made him stay and that he had been given a fresh chance. He also said that he would have left Fulham if Roy Hodgson had stayed in charge of the club (he became manager of Liverpool instead). Kamara did get more playing time for Fulham as the club was short of options following injuries to Bobby Zamora and Mousa Dembélé. He scored his first league goal of the 2010–11 season on 16 October 2010 against Tottenham Hotspur, in a 2–1 defeat in the 30th minute at Craven Cottage. He also scored in a 2–1 defeat against Arsenal on 4 December 2010 at the Emirates Stadium in the 30th minute, playing 73 minutes of the match before being replaced by fellow striker Andrew Johnson. Despite the loss, manager Mark Hughes praised Kamara&#x27;s performance, whilst Kamara stated that he was keen to hold down a regular first team place. On 8 January 2011, Kamara netted a hat-trick and played the full 90 minutes in the third round of the FA Cup against Peterborough United in a 6–2 victory at Craven Cottage. However, after the return of Zamora and Dembélé from injury, further opportunities were limited.

====Loan to Leicester City====
Leicester City signed Kamara on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season on 21 March 2011 after Leicester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson confirmed his interest in signing him. Kamara made his competitive debut against Middlesbrough on 2 April 2011, making an assist in a 3–3 draw. He scored his first goal in a 4–0 win over Burnley on 9 April. He scored his second goal against Ipswich making the score 4–2. It was the last league goal to be scored at the Walkers Stadium before it was renamed to King Power Stadium in summer 2011. After his loan spell finished, Kamara admitted his contribution was disappointing at Leicester City but was open to a return.

===Eskişehirspor===
On 24 June 2011, Fulham announced that Kamara would not be renewing his contract and had left the club to sign with Süper Lig club Eskisehirspor. On 10 September 2011, Kamara made his debut in the Eskişehirspor shirt against Beşiktaş in a 2–1 win. The following week, he scored his first goal for Eskişehirspor in a 4–0 win over Sivasspor on 18 September 2011. Kamara continued his goalscoring form and became the top scorer for the club in his first season with 10 goals and the second top assist provider with 5 behind defender Dedê with 10.

===NorthEast United===
On 7 July 2015, he signed for Indian Super League club NorthEast United FC.

==International career==
Kamara played 50 games and scored nine goals for the Senegal national team.

<text>10,000 Promises. is a Japanese popular music group. Its members are Shaw, Shinya, Taiki, and Yohei. They made their debut with the single &quot;One True Love&quot; on February 18, 2004. It seems the name of this band derived from one of Backstreet Boys music tracks as &quot;10,000 Promises&quot;.

In July 2001, Taiki who was known for his live performances met Yohei who was already making songs and they decided to work together. During September of that same year, Taiki&#x27;s friend from his school days, Shinya, got together with Taiki and Yohei. With an introduction from another friend, the three met Shaw and formed the group 10,000 Promises.

They&#x27;ve done renditions of the popular Westlife hits, &quot;What Makes a Man&quot; and &quot;Bop Bop Baby&quot;

<doc id="1001211" wikidata="Q837139" url="?curid=1001211" title="Full-rigged pinnace">
<text>The full-rigged pinnace was the larger of two types of vessel called a pinnace in use from the sixteenth century.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;pinnace&quot;, and similar words in many languages (as far afield as Indonesia, where the boat &quot;pinisi&quot; took its name from the Dutch &quot;pinas&quot;), came ultimately from the Spanish &quot;pinaza&quot; c. 1240, from &quot;pino&quot; (pine tree), from the wood of which the ships were constructed. The word came into English from the Middle French &quot;pinasse&quot;.

==Design==

The pinnace is perhaps the most confusing of all the early seventeenth-century types of vessels. Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths, pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors.

The rigs of pinnaces included the single-masted fore-and-aft rig with staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit. Open square-sterned pulling boats were also called pinnaces at least as early as 1626. The larger pinnace &#x27;type&#x27; was often much larger than the smaller tender type, and frequently carried enough cannon to be considered an (armed) merchantman, or fast and maneuverable small warship.

== Pinnaces ==
The English pinnace &quot;Sunne&quot; was the first vessel reported built at the Chatham Dockyard, in 1586. English pinnaces of the time were typically of around 100 tons, and carried 5 to 16 guns.

The Dutch built pinnaces during the early 17th century. Dutch pinnaces had a hull form resembling a small race-built galleon and usually rigged as a ship (square rigged on three masts), or carrying a similar rig on two masts (in a fashion akin to the later &quot;brig&quot;). Pinnaces were used as fast merchant vessels, pirate vessels and small warships. Not all were small vessels, some being nearer to larger ships in tonnage.

This type saw widespread use in northern waters, as they had a shallow draught. In 2009 the wreck of an Elizabethan English pinnace with a set of twelve matched cannon was discovered, the first of its type for the time. Vessels at that time typically carried a mixture of unmatched cannon using disparate ammunition. The matched armament is considered revolutionary, and a contributing factor to the deadly reputation of the English naval artillery.

The first English ship built in North America, Virginia of Sagadahoc, was a pinnace.

<text>William George Fay (12 November 1872 – 27 October 1947) was an actor and theatre producer who was one of the co-founders of the Abbey Theatre.

Fay was born in Dublin, where he attended Belvedere College. He worked for a time in the 1890s with a touring theatre company in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. When he returned to Dublin, he worked with his older brother Frank, staging productions in halls around the city. Finally, they formed W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent. The brothers participated in founding the Abbey Theatre and were largely responsible for evolving the Abbey style of acting. After a falling-out with the Abbey directors in 1908, the brothers emigrated to the United States to work in theatre there.

He moved to London in 1914, working as an actor on stage and in films. 

He played Johnnie, in the film, Spellbound (1941 film). One of his most notable film roles was as Father Tom in Carol Reed&#x27;s Belfast-set &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947), whose cast was dense with actors from the Abbey Theatre. His memoir, &quot;The Fays of the Abbey Theatre&quot;, appeared in 1935. Willie Fay died in London in 1947, aged 74.

<doc id="1001216" wikidata="Q7244267" url="?curid=1001216" title="Prince Vultan">
<text>Prince Vultan is a fictional character in the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip and its adaptations. Vultan is the ruler of the Winged Bird-Men, a race of flying extraterrestrials who dwell in Sky City, a metropolis that floats in the sky. He fits the archetype of the Viking: strong, hearty, and with a great appetite for life, food, drink, and women (particularly Flash&#x27;s girlfriend, Dale Arden).

==In the comics==
Prince Vultan is introduced as a reluctant ally of main villain Ming the Merciless; he resents Ming&#x27;s domination but does not oppose it out of fear of reprisal. However, after Flash and Dr. Zarkov save his city, he reforms into one of Flash Gordon&#x27;s greatest allies. In the original comic, he has several wives, one of whom tries to kill Dale, as she is jealous of her. He claims to have become King of Sky City after winning one of the Tournaments of Mongo. When Ming tries to kidnap Flash, Vultan calls for a Tournament of Mongo. It is revealed that, along with Ming and King Jugrid of the Lion Men, he is one of the three most powerful rulers on Mongo. When Flash takes over the unconquered Kingdom of Caves, Vultan sends a party of Hawkmen under Captain Khan to help Flash conquer his Kingdom. The Hawkmen later come into conflict with Queen Azura and her Blue Magic Men. The image of the Hawkmen descending to attack Azura&#x27;s army (from the June 16, 1935 storyline) is one of the most reproduced scenes from the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip.

Vultan and the other Hawkmen provoked some controversy at the time of publication. Some Christian leaders regarded the characters as blasphemous because they resembled angels.

==In other media==
In the 1936 film serial, he was portrayed by Jack Lipson (1901-1947).

Allan Melvin provided Vultan&#x27;s voice in the 1979 Filmation animated series. He is referred to here as King Vultan, not Prince. His Sky City is a marvel of Mongo technology, as the massive construct is suspended miles above ground by beams of polarized anti-gravity light. Unlike Prince Barin&#x27;s kingdom of Arboria, Vultan&#x27;s Hawkmen do not make use of airships in battle. Instead, they fly under their own power or ride giant warbirds armed with harness-mounted energy cannons.

He was portrayed by Brian Blessed in the cult 1980 film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. For the film&#x27;s soundtrack by the rock group Queen, Freddie Mercury composed a song called &quot;Vultan&#x27;s Theme&quot;. At the end, he is appointed the General of the Armies when Prince Barin is revealed as the rightful ruler of Mongo.

In the 1996 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; animated series, Vultan is a somewhat conservative leader, and reluctant to act against Ming for fear of reprisals against his people. His role as Flash&#x27;s ally is taken by his teenage son, Prince Talon.

In the 2007 television series, Vultan appears as one of the leaders of a group of nomadic mercenaries called Dactyls (a variation of the Hawkmen). In the episode, &quot;Ascension&quot;, Vultan travels to Earth, using Princess Aura&#x27;s rift key. He kidnaps a teenage boy who he claims is his son. He is played by Ty Olsson.

In a 2008 episode of the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; called &quot;Road to Germany&quot;, Brian, Stewie and Mort enlist the help of Vultan&#x27;s Hawkman Army in a dogfight over Europe against the Luftwaffe. Blessed returns to voice Vultan briefly during the episode.

<text>Quad Data Rate (QDR) SRAM is a type of static RAM computer memory that can transfer up to four words of data in each clock cycle. Like Double Data-Rate (DDR) SDRAM, QDR SRAM transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal. The main purpose of this capability is to enable reads and writes to occur at high clock frequencies without the loss of bandwidth due to bus-turnaround cycles incurred in DDR SRAM. QDR SRAM uses two clocks, one for read data and one for write data and has separate read and write data buses (also known as Separate I/O), whereas DDR SRAM uses a single clock and has a single common data bus used for both reads and writes (also known as Common I/O). This helps to eliminate problems caused by the propagation delay of the clock wiring, and allows the illusion of concurrent reads and writes (as seen on the bus, although internally the memory still has a conventional single port - operations are pipelined but sequential).

When all data I/O signals are accounted, QDR SRAM is not 2x faster than DDR SRAM but is 100% efficient when reads and writes are interleaved. In contrast, DDR SRAM is most efficient when only one request type is continually repeated, e.g. only read cycles. When write cycles are interleaved with read cycles, one or more cycles are lost for bus turnaround to avoid data contention, which reduces bus efficiency. Most SRAM manufacturers constructed QDR and DDR SRAM using the same physical silicon, differentiated by a post-manufacturing selection (e.g. blowing a fuse on chip).

QDR SRAM was designed for high-speed communications and networking applications, where data throughput is more important than cost, power efficiency or density. The technology was created by Micron and Cypress, later followed by IDT, then NEC, Samsung and Renesas. Quad Data Rate II+ Memory is currently being designed by Cypress Semiconductor for Radiation Hardened Environments.

==I/O==

===Clock inputs===
4 clock lines:
* Input clock:
** K
** not-K, or /K
* Output clock:
** C
** not-C, or /C

===Control inputs===
Two control lines:
*not-Write enable: /WPS
*not-Read enable: /RPS

===Buses===
One address bus and two data buses:
*Address bus
*Data in bus
*Data out bus

==Clocking scheme==

*Addresses
**Read address latched on rising edge of C
**Write address latched on rising edge of K (in burst-of-4 mode, burst-of-2 uses rising edge of not-K)
*Data
**Write
***If /WPS is low
****A data word on &quot;Data In&quot; is latched on rising edge of K
****The next data word on &quot;Data In&quot; is latched on rising edge of /K
**Read
***A read is a two-cycle process
***If /RPS is low
****The first rising edge of C latches the read address, A
****The second rising edge of C puts the data word, from address A, on the &quot;Data Out&quot; bus
****The next rising edge of /C puts the next data word, from address A+1, on the &quot;Data Out&quot; bus

<text>Antonio González de Balcarce (June 24, 1774 – August 15, 1819) was an Argentine military commander in the early 19th century.

González de Balcarce was born in Buenos Aires. He joined the armed forces as a cadet in 1788. In the battle for Montevideo in 1807, he was captured by the British forces and taken to England. After his release, he fought in the service of Spain during the Peninsular War against the Emperor Napoleon. Returning to Buenos Aires, he participated in the May Revolution in 1810. Subsequently, he was named second commander for the military campaign of the independentist forces in the Viceroyalty of Peru, where he won the Battle of Suipacha on November 7, 1810, the first victory over the Spanish royal forces.

Eventually, he was called back and became the Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1813. In 1816, he served as the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata &quot;ad interim&quot;, and became the Major General of the armed forces the following year under the government of Juan Martín de Pueyrredón. According to historian William Denslow, Antonio Balcarce was a member of the well-known masonic lodge &quot;Lautaro&quot;. He took part in the crossing of the Andes to Chile and was San Martín&#x27;s second-in-command during the battles of Cancha Rayada and Maipu.

He fell ill in Chile and had to return to Buenos Aires, where he died in 1819.

<doc id="1001227" wikidata="Q3966104" url="?curid=1001227" title="Epidural space">
<text>In anatomy, the epidural space is the potential space between the dura mater and vertebrae (spine).

The anatomy term &quot;epidural space&quot; has its origin in the Ancient Greek language; , &quot;on, upon&quot; + dura mater also known as &quot;epidural cavity&quot;, &quot;extradural space&quot; or &quot;peridural space&quot;. In humans the epidural space contains lymphatics, spinal nerve roots, loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, small arteries, dural venous sinuses and a network of internal vertebral venous plexuses.

==Cranial epidural space==
In the skull, the periosteal layer of the dura mater adheres to the inner surface of the skull bones while the meningeal layer lays over the arachnoid mater. Between them is the epidural space. The two layers of the dura mater separate at several places, with the meningeal layer projecting deeper into the brain parenchyma forming fibrous septa that compartmentalize the brain tissue. At these sites, the epidural space is wide enough to house the epidural venous sinuses.

There are four fibrous septa:

# Falx cerebri, that separates the left and right hemispheres of the cerebrum. It contains the superior sagittal sinus and inferior sagittal sinus.
# Tentorium cerebelli, which separates the cerebrum from cerebellum and contains the transverse sinus, straight sinus and superior petrosal sinus.
# Diaphragma sellae, that encloses the hypophyseal fossa from the superior side, cushioning the pituitary gland. It contains the anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses.
# Falx cerebelli, which separates the left and right cerebellar hemispheres and contains the occipital sinus.

In pathological conditions fluid such as blood can fill this space. For example a torn meningeal artery (often the middle meningeal artery) or dural venous sinus (rarely) may bleed into this potential space and result in an epidural hematoma.

== Spinal epidural space ==
In the spinal canal, the periosteal layer adheres to the inner surface of the spinal canal which is formed by the bodies of vertebrae. The meningeal layer lays over the spinal arachnoid mater. Between the vertebrae and the dural sheath is the spinal epidural space. Unlike the cranial epidural space, the spinal epidural space contains adipose tissue, the internal vertebral venous plexuses and the spinal nerve roots. The spinal epidural space spans the length of the spinal cord, from the foramen magnum superiorly to the sacral hiatus inferiorly.

Epidural space is the smallest at the cervical region, measuring 1 to 2 mm. At L2 to L3, enlarges until 5 to 6 mm. It then enlarges progressively until lower lumbar and sacral region. However, some authors stated that it decreases in size after mid-lumbar region until 2 mm at S1 level.

<text>Francis John Fay (30 August 1870 – 2 January 1931), older brother of William Fay, was an actor and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. He worked with his brother, William, staging productions in halls around the city. In 1902 the two brothers joined the Irish Literary Theatre. Finally, they formed W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent.

The brothers participated in the founding of the Abbey Theatre and were largely responsible for evolving the Abbey style of acting. After a falling-out with the Abbey directors in 1908, they emigrated to the United States and produced Irish plays there.

In 1921, he retired to Dublin, where he taught elocution and directing plays in local colleges.

<text>Peter James Crouch (born 30 January 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He was capped 42 times by the England national team between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country during that time, appearing at two FIFA World Cups. He is one of 33 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals, and jointly holds the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history. A tall forward, with a slender physique, Crouch was known for his aerial abilities, technical abilities and hold-up play.

Crouch began his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK Hässleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, Portsmouth acquired him in a transfer deal worth £1.5 million. He had a strong first season at Fratton Park, and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for £5 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton, where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining Liverpool in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final.

After scoring 42 goals in three seasons at Anfield, Portsmouth re-acquired Crouch for £11 million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international Jermain Defoe. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and Harry Redknapp. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against Manchester City which earned the club a place in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010–11, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined Stoke City in August 2011, for a club record fee of £10 million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award. He scored eight in 2012–13 and ten in both the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. Crouch spent seven and a half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019. He retired in July 2019 after the end of his contract.

==Early life==
Crouch was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, but his family moved to Singapore when he was one year old. The move came about when his father Bruce, originally from Fulham, took up a job offer to work at a Singaporean advertising agency. The Crouch family spent three years living in Southeast Asia, and moved back to England after Bruce rejected the chance to work in Australia. They then spent time living at a YMCA in Tottenham before settling in Harrow on the Hill. Crouch attended Roxeth Primary and North Ealing Primary and began to play football with Northolt Hotspurs. He was then invited to join the Brentford Centre of Excellence in 1991 and he also played for the boys club West Middlesex Colts whilst attending Drayton Manor High School. Crouch turned down contract offers from Chelsea and Millwall and instead joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 1994. He did not stay at QPR for long, however, for in November 1994, the coaching staff at Loftus Road moved to Tottenham Hotspur, including its youth team manager Des Bulpin, who offered Crouch a contract at Spurs.

Crouch&#x27;s family were Chelsea supporters, and he became a ball boy at Stamford Bridge at the age of ten. As a child, he attended some Chelsea matches. Later, he told the Liverpool official website that despite this, he and his friends at the time were fans of QPR.

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth team. However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at Dulwich Hamlet in the Isthmian League Premier Division and, in the summer of 2000, IFK Hässleholm in Sweden, where he played in the country&#x27;s third tier. His move to Sweden came about when IFK Hässleholm sold Jon Jönsson to Tottenham for £70,000 and also agreed two loan deals for the Swedish club, that of Crouch and Alton Thelwell.

===QPR and Portsmouth===
On 28 July 2000, Tottenham sold Crouch to First Division club Queens Park Rangers for £60,000. He made an immediate impression with QPR, scoring ten league goals in the 2000–01 season, but it was not enough to prevent the team&#x27;s relegation to the Second Division.

Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and Portsmouth bought Crouch for £1.5 million. Crouch scored 18 league goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth during the 2001–02 season and was tipped by manager Graham Rix to have a big future in the game.

===Aston Villa===
In March 2002, Premier League club Aston Villa made a successful £5 million bid for Crouch. He scored on his home debut for Villa, the equalising goal against Newcastle United, and went on to score twice in seven appearances. Crouch, however, failed to hold down a regular place in the Aston Villa team in the following 2002–03 season making 18 appearances without scoring. Looking for first team football, he was loaned to Norwich City from September to December 2003. Crouch played 15 times for the Canaries in 2003–04, scoring four goals helping the team gain promotion. Crouch was sent off for retaliation during Norwich&#x27;s 3–1 win at Walsall, but nonetheless his spell at Norwich renewed interest in his abilities from other clubs.

At the end of the three-month loan, he returned to Aston Villa, and scored a brace against Leicester City, a late winner at Middlesbrough and the opener at Bolton Wanderers. Villa sold Crouch in July 2004 to Southampton for a fee of £2.5 million.

===Southampton===
Despite initially being back-up to first choice strikers James Beattie and Kevin Phillips, Crouch became the main attacking focus of the Southampton team upon the arrival of Harry Redknapp and the sale of Beattie. He scored many key goals in Southampton&#x27;s relegation battle, including memorable goals against Liverpool in a 2–0 home win, Arsenal in a 1–1 home draw and two away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory. He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and Saints&#x27; arch-rival Portsmouth out of the FA Cup. His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first England call-up. After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the 2004–05 season, his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the Premier League. On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7 million to Liverpool on a four-year contract.

===Liverpool===
Crouch underwent intense media scrutiny because of a goal drought during his first months at Liverpool. For 19 matches—the span of four months—he was unable to score. Crouch was praised for other facets of his game, such as his touch on the ball, but his first goal for the club evaded him. The fact that Crouch possessed &quot;good touch for a big man&quot; became something of a media cliché during this time. Early in his Liverpool career, the supporters composed a new chant: &quot;He&#x27;s big, he&#x27;s red, his feet stick out the bed, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch.&quot;

The drought finally ended on 3 December 2005 when he scored against Wigan Athletic. Although this first goal was originally given as an own goal, it was later awarded to Crouch on appeal; he went on to score a second goal in the same match. Before these goals, Crouch had played over 24 hours of football for Liverpool without scoring. In addition to this, he also had to deal with unpleasant taunts from crowds at matches, as he had throughout his footballing career, who often chanted &quot;freak&quot; at him due to his unusual height. He went on to score several goals that season, including the only goal in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Manchester United, Liverpool&#x27;s first victory over them in the FA Cup post-Second World War. On 13 May, he helped Liverpool to win the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham United, providing an assist for Steven Gerrard to score the second Liverpool goal.

Three months later, in the curtain-raiser to the 2006–07 season, he headed the winning goal for Liverpool in the club&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Chelsea in the FA Community Shield. In their 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign, he scored his first goals in European club competition against Maccabi Haifa. Crouch sustained a broken nose when playing against Sheffield United in February 2007. Although he played in some subsequent matches, on 9 March 2007, it was announced that he would undergo surgery on the injury that would keep him out of football for a month. On 31 March, he returned to action after the operation and scored the first hat-trick of his club career, coming against Arsenal in a 4–1 victory. This was also a so-called &quot;perfect hat-trick,&quot; consisting of goals scored from his right foot, left foot and head. He later participated in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute for Javier Mascherano as Liverpool were defeated by Milan in Athens. He ended the 2006–07 season as Liverpool&#x27;s top goalscorer in all competitions, with eighteen goals.

At the start of the 2007–08 season, he had restricted opportunities to play for Liverpool due to the arrival of other strikers, including Fernando Torres, but nonetheless scored against Toulouse in a Champions League qualifying win in August, his eighth goal in his past ten appearances in that competition, and then also scoring the first and last goals of an 8–0 win over Beşiktaş in the first round of the Champions League in November. On 19 December, Crouch was sent off in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, receiving a straight red card for a foul on Chelsea&#x27;s Mikel John Obi as Liverpool exited the tournament. In April, he scored a vital goal in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, helping Liverpool secure fourth spot ahead of local rivals Everton.

===Return to Portsmouth===
On 7 July 2008, it was announced that Crouch had verbally agreed to join former club and FA Cup holders Portsmouth in a deal worth up to £11 million. Crouch passed his medical the following day, and, on 11 July, Crouch&#x27;s transfer was officially unveiled at a Portsmouth news conference. Crouch scored his first goal on his return to Portsmouth in a 3–0 win against Everton at Goodison Park on 30 August 2008. Crouch then went on to net his first goal at Portsmouth&#x27;s Fratton Park home ground in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur on 28 September. On 2 October 2008, Crouch scored twice in extra time in a UEFA Cup match away to Portuguese team Vitória de Guimarães to help Portsmouth reach the group stages of the competition. He went on to score twice against Heerenveen in a 3–0 victory at Fratton Park, however Portsmouth failed to make it out of the group stages. Crouch played 46 times for Pompey in 2008–09, scoring 16 goals as the side finished in 14th position.

===Return to Tottenham Hotspur===
On 27 July 2009, Tottenham Hotspur signed Crouch from Portsmouth for a fee of £10 million, on a five-year contract. Crouch made his debut for Spurs in a pre-season friendly against Olympiacos, and came on as a substitute in Tottenham&#x27;s season opening win over Liverpool, making his full Premier League debut for the club in the process. He scored his first goal for Tottenham in the League Cup tie against Doncaster Rovers in a 5–1 win on 26 August 2009. He scored again in his next match, opening his league account with Spurs with a goal in a 2–1 home win against Birmingham City. On 23 September, Crouch scored his first hat-trick for Spurs in a 5–1 win over Preston North End in the League Cup. In May, his late goal against Manchester City in what was being dubbed as the &quot;£15 million game&quot; put Spurs in a position to claim their first-ever Champions League berth. After having hit the post and missed a Benoît Assou-Ekotto cross, Crouch scored a header after goalkeeper Márton Fülöp could only parry the ball into his path.

On 25 August 2010, Crouch scored a hat-trick at White Hart Lane against Young Boys to help Tottenham to reach the group stage of the 2010–11 Champions League. On 15 February 2011, Crouch scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the Champions League second round, first leg match against Milan at the San Siro, sweeping home Aaron Lennon&#x27;s cut-back after a counter-attack. Three weeks later, Spurs progressed to the quarter-finals after the reverse fixture at White Hart Lane ended 0–0. On 5 April, he was sent off in the 14th minute after receiving two yellow cards in the quarter-finals against Real Madrid. He scored an own goal against Manchester City, which consequently confirmed City into the Champions League for the 2011–12 season with Tottenham finishing fifth.

===Stoke City===
On 31 August 2011, Stoke City signed Crouch from Tottenham for a then club record fee of £10 million, that would rise to £12 million, on a four-year contract. Speaking after sealing his move to the Britannia Stadium, Crouch revealed that his former Tottenham teammate Jonathan Woodgate was a major influence upon his decision to join Stoke. Crouch made his debut for Stoke City in a 1–0 win against former club Liverpool on 10 September 2011. He scored his first goal for the Potters in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United, making Stoke the sixth Premier League club he has scored for. He scored his second goal in the following match against Beşiktaş in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League campaign. Crouch went on to score against Arsenal, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers before missing out on the Christmas period matches after suffering from a virus.

On 2 January 2012, against Blackburn, Crouch scored both goals in a 2–1 victory. It was a landmark achievement for Crouch as he surpassed 100 league goals. On 24 March 2012, Crouch scored a stunning long-distance volley against Manchester City in a 1–1 draw at the Britannia Stadium. After the match, Crouch stated that it was the best goal of his career. He scored the winning goal for Stoke against their Midlands rivals Wolves on 7 April to take his goal tally to 13 and was backed by manager Tony Pulis to earn a recall to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. At the end of season awards dinner, Crouch won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year and Goal of the Season awards.

Crouch began the 2012–13 season well, scoring five goals in seven matches, against Swindon Town, Wigan Athletic, Manchester City and a brace against Swansea City. He lost several teeth after being accidentally kicked in the mouth by Fabricio Coloccini in a match against Newcastle United on 28 November 2012 and as a result had to undergo corrective surgery. He then went three months without a goal before scoring against Wigan on 29 January 2013. Crouch again went through a three-month barren spell in front of goal before scoring against former club Queens Park Rangers on 20 April 2013 in a 2–0 victory. He scored on the final day of the season against Southampton as he ended the 2012–13 season with eight goals, with Stoke finishing 13th in the league.

Mark Hughes replaced Tony Pulis as manager in May 2013 and despite starting the first two matches of the 2013–14 season, Hughes dropped Crouch to the bench. He returned to the starting line up on 26 October 2013 and scored in a 3–2 defeat against Manchester United. Crouch retained his place in the team for the remainder of the 2013–14 season, where he finished as top scorer with ten goals in 38 appearances as Stoke finished in ninth place.

Crouch scored his first goals of 2014–15 in September 2014 against QPR and Newcastle. In October 2014, Crouch stated that he would like to remain at the Britannia Stadium with Stoke for the remainder of his career. On 29 October 2014, Crouch came on as a substitute in Stoke&#x27;s League Cup defeat to Southampton; 15 minutes later, he was sent off for two yellow cards in the space of two minutes. On 6 December, he scored after 19 seconds against Arsenal in an eventual 3–2 victory. A week later, in his 600th match in English football, Crouch scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Crystal Palace. Crouch signed a two-year contract extension in January 2015.

On 28 February 2015, Crouch scored the winning goal in Stoke&#x27;s 1–0 win over Hull City, equaling Alan Shearer&#x27;s record of 46 headed goals in the Premier League. He surpassed this on 24 May with a header five minutes after coming on as a substitute to conclude a 6–1 home win over Liverpool in Stoke&#x27;s final match of the season. In total, Crouch matched the previous season&#x27;s goal tally of ten goals in 38 appearances as Stoke finished in ninth position for the second consecutive season. Following the end of the season, Crouch underwent groin surgery. Crouch struggled for game time in 2015–16 making 18 appearances of which nine were as a substitute. He scored just twice, which came against lower league Fulham and Doncaster Rovers in cup competitions.

Crouch scored a hat-trick away to Stevenage in the EFL Cup, on 23 August 2016 in a 4–0 win. On 9 January 2017, Crouch signed a new contract with Stoke in a deal lasting until the summer of 2018. Crouch scored four goals in five games at the turn of the year including his 100th Premier League goal, the oldest player to hit the landmark. Crouch made 29 appearances in 2016–17, scoring ten goals, as Stoke finished in 13th position. After the season ended Crouch stated that he wants to continue playing until he is 40.

Crouch set a record for the most appearances as substitute in the Premier League, on 20 November 2017 when he came off the bench for the 143rd time against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, breaking the record held by Shola Ameobi. He also became Stoke City&#x27;s leading Premier League goalscorer of all time during the same season, reaching 45 goals and overtaking the 43 scored by Jonathan Walters. Crouch signed another one-year contract extension with the Potters in November 2017. Crouch played 34 times in 2017–18, scoring six goals as Stoke were relegated to the Championship.

===Burnley===
Crouch signed for Premier League club Burnley on 31 January 2019 on a contract until the end of the 2018–19 season in a player-exchange deal with Sam Vokes. Crouch made his debut for Burnley on 2 February, coming on as a 76th minute substitute in a 1–1 draw against Southampton; he made an immediate impact, as he was instrumental in Burnley being awarded their first penalty for a season-and-a-half. He was released at the end of the season and announced his retirement from professional football on 12 July 2019 at the age of 38.

==International career==
===Youth international===
Crouch was capped for the England under-20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, with teammates including Stuart Taylor, Ashley Cole, Andrew Johnson and Matthew Etherington. However, the team finished bottom at the group stage, with three losses and having scored no goals. He was later a part of David Platt&#x27;s England under-21 team, which went to the finals of the European Under-21 Championship in Switzerland in May 2002, where he scored once against Switzerland.

===Breakthrough into senior team===
In May 2005 he was handed his first call-up to the England senior squad by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson for the team&#x27;s tour of the United States, making his debut against Colombia. He went on to make two appearances during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign for England: starting against Austria in a 1–0 victory and coming on as a substitute against Poland in a 2–1 win. In the latter appearance, Crouch&#x27;s introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England&#x27;s own supporters. On 1 March 2006, he scored his first goal for England, with the equaliser in a 2–1 friendly win over Uruguay. He did this whilst bizarrely wearing two different squad numbers on his shirt – No. 21 on the front (his designated squad number for the match), and the incorrect No. 12 on the back.

In May 2006, Crouch was included in the 23-man England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was expected to be a significant figure in the team due to Wayne Rooney&#x27;s foot injury. On 30 May, he played in a pre-World Cup friendly against Hungary, scoring the third goal in England&#x27;s 3–1 win. He followed his goal with his iconic robotic dancing goal celebration. On 3 June, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 pre-World Cup friendly victory against Jamaica where he again performed his robotic celebration.

===2006 World Cup===
After his displays in England&#x27;s friendlies, Crouch partnered with Michael Owen in attack for England&#x27;s opening 2006 World Cup match against Paraguay on 10 June 2006. England won the match 1–0 and Crouch kept his place in the starting line-up for the following match against Trinidad and Tobago, against whom he scored his first competitive international goal. The goal provoked some controversy as replays showed Crouch to be pulling on Brent Sancho&#x27;s long hair, holding the defender down, to gain an advantage.

Crouch was rested for England&#x27;s third group match against Sweden as Rooney returned from injury to join the starting line-up. However, Owen suffered a serious knee injury in the opening minute of the match and Crouch replaced him, playing the remainder of the match. In England&#x27;s 1–0 second round victory against Ecuador, Crouch remained an unused substitute as Eriksson switched the team to a new formation with Wayne Rooney as a lone striker. After Rooney&#x27;s dismissal for a foul in England&#x27;s quarter-final against Portugal, Crouch came on as a substitute for Joe Cole, as England went on to get knocked out on penalties. On 5 September 2007, retired English referee Graham Poll claimed that FIFA had specifically warned referees at the event to pay close attention to Crouch, claiming that &quot;he&#x27;s a real pain and he&#x27;s getting away with too much.&quot;

===Euro 2008 qualifying===
Crouch remained a part of the England set-up under Eriksson&#x27;s successor as manager, Steve McClaren, and started McClaren&#x27;s first match in charge, a friendly against Greece in August 2006. He scored twice in England&#x27;s 4–0 victory. Two further goals followed in England&#x27;s next match, a 5–0 win over Andorra in their opening qualifying match for UEFA Euro 2008 on 2 September 2006. Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year. In fact, this had happened several times pre-Second World War, most recently by Dixie Dean (12 goals in 1927) and George Camsell (11 goals in 1929). An operation needed for a nose injury he sustained playing for Liverpool prevented him from playing in England&#x27;s two qualifying matches in March 2007. He returned to the England squad for their matches against Brazil and Estonia in late May and early June 2007, scoring in the qualifying match against the latter. Crouch was England&#x27;s top scorer in the qualifying campaign with five goals, but this did not prevent England finishing only third in their group and failing to progress to the finals of the competition.

===Capello era===
On 1 April 2009, Crouch made his first start under McClaren&#x27;s successor, Fabio Capello, in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Ukraine. He scored England&#x27;s first goal in their 2–1 victory. Crouch was re-called to the England squad for the friendly against Slovenia and the World Cup qualifier versus Croatia, following his fine form for Tottenham. Crouch also got an early first half goal against Belarus in the final 2010 World Cup qualifier, which he then followed up with a second goal in the 76th minute. This took Crouch&#x27;s tally for England up to 18 goals in just 17 starts. Crouch scored a brace after coming on as a substitute against Egypt in a friendly on 3 March 2010 to take his overall international goal tally to 20. He also scored the second goal for England against Mexico at Wembley Stadium on 24 May 2010.

===2010 World Cup===
Crouch was named in Capello&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup and was given the number 9 shirt. He came on as a substitute for Emile Heskey in England&#x27;s opening match against the United States and also came off the bench for Gareth Barry in the following match against Algeria. Crouch did not take part in the final group stage match with Slovenia or the 4–1 loss to Germany in the last-16.

===Post-2010 World Cup===
Crouch came on as a substitute in the home friendly against France for the injured Steven Gerrard on 17 November 2010. He scored quickly from an Ashley Young corner to make the score 1–2 with an angled side-footed volley. It was his second touch of the ball. After not making an appearance for England for almost a year, Crouch stated in October 2011 that he &quot;does not carry much hope&quot; of receiving a call-up.

Crouch was not part of the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. After the tournament it was reported that Crouch refused to be in it unless he was part of the original squad, according to manager Roy Hodgson, which drew criticism directed at him. However, Crouch afterwards said that this was not the case and that he would &quot;never&quot; not want to play for England.

During a run of good form in September 2017, Crouch said in a television interview that he was not officially retired from international football.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
A tall forward, with a slender physique, Crouch was known for possessing a good first touch, as well as an eye for goal; however, he was also known for his lack of significant pace, strength, power, and athleticism, while his movement occasionally came under criticism in the media. He usually played as a &quot;target man&quot; in a centre-forward role throughout his career, or as a striker, due to his ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal and link-up with his teammates. Although he was criticised in his youth for his limited ability in the air, despite his height, and for his inability to out–jump other players, he holds the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history. He was also known for his longevity, and had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals from bicycle kicks. Crouch has attributed his success as a footballer to his own hard work and determination.

===Personality as a footballer===
====Nicknames====
Although generally known as &quot;Crouchy,&quot; other nicknames he has been given by fans and the media in England have included &quot;RoboCrouch&quot; and &quot;Crouchinho&quot; (an ironic use of the &quot;-inho&quot; suffix, meaning &quot;little&quot; in Portuguese and used by many Brazilian footballers). He has been also referred to as &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; by Univision&#x27;s commentators and as &quot;Pantera Rosa&quot; (&quot;Pink Panther&quot;) by Fox Sports en Español commentators.

====Robotic dancing====
In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing goal celebration. A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate David Beckham&#x27;s house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May. He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper wrote that the dance was inspired by the lyrics to the Arctic Monkeys&#x27; hit single &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot;.

On 12 June, Crouch announced he would perform his robotic dance again only if England were to win the World Cup, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not about robotic dancing. It is about scoring goals and winning matches. It&#x27;s an important time for everyone now.&quot; In September 2006, he was quoted in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper as saying that, &quot;It was funny at the time, but I didn&#x27;t want to carry on doing it until it became unfunny. I&#x27;ve stopped doing it for the time being, but if I ever score a really big goal you never know.&quot;

On 6 August 2007, Crouch said he would never use the robot dance again unless he scored in the UEFA Champions League Final, but he partially reprised it on 1 April 2009 after scoring during England&#x27;s World Cup qualifier against Ukraine after a Comic Relief sketch.

On 1 February 2017, Crouch gave the dance a final outing to celebrate his 100th Premier League goal.

==After football==
After retiring from football in 2019 at the age of 38, Crouch has worked on a Saturday night BBC One TV show titled &quot;Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer&quot;. In 2022, he became a member of the panel for the TV series &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Crouch met model Abbey Clancy in December 2005, in a nightclub where Clancy worked. The couple married on 30 June 2011, shortly after the birth of their first child. They have two daughters and two sons, Sophia Ruby (born March 2011), Liberty Rose (born June 2015), Johnny (born January 2018) and Jack (born June 2019).

In August 2012, Crouch pleaded guilty to a speeding offence from November 2011, and was ordered to pay a fine plus costs of £1,365. In September 2012, Crouch was disqualified from driving for six months and also incurred 12 penalty points. He was additionally ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £1,585 for failing to identify the driver of his vehicle on two separate occasions.

Crouch released his autobiography in 2007, titled &quot;Walking Tall – My Story&quot;. His second book, &quot;How to be a Footballer&quot;, was released in 2018. In autumn 2018, the first series of &quot;That Peter Crouch Podcast&quot; aired, featuring Crouch along with Tom Fordyce and Chris Stark.

Crouch has a GNVQ in Leisure and Tourism, which he obtained as part of a mandatory educational programme while at Tottenham Hotspur.

<doc id="1001234" wikidata="Q122252" url="?curid=1001234" title="Tow-in surfing">
<text>Tow-in surfing is a surfing technique which uses artificial assistance to allow the surfer to catch faster-moving waves than was traditionally possible when paddling by hand. Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to catch big waves and break the barrier. It has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in surfing history.

==History==
Tow-in surfing was pioneered by Laird Hamilton, Buzzy Kerbox, Dave Kalama, and others in the mid 1990s. A surfer is towed into a breaking wave by a partner driving a personal watercraft (PWC, commonly known by the brand name Jet Ski) or a helicopter with an attached tow-line. This method has a demonstrated advantage in situations where the wave is too large (such as Peahi off the north side of Maui), or where position on the wave is extremely critical (Teahupoo off southeast Tahiti).

The use of a helicopter for tow-in surfing started to appear in the mid 2000s, and has several advantages over the use of a personal watercraft. The pilot, positioned high above the surfer, is able to spot large waves from farther away and position the surfer accordingly. A helicopter can go faster, and is not affected by the ocean surface like a watercraft, but is much more expensive to operate.

Before tow-in surfing was created, surfers were not capable of catching waves that were between tall on their surfboards made for larger waves called &quot;guns&quot;. The biggest wave one could catch before tow-in surfing was in the range. Tow-in surfing is accomplished by taking a personal watercraft (PWC) and a tow-rope and combining that with a surfer. One person pulls the surfer out to the break on the PWC. When the waves comes, the person on the PWC tows the surfer via the tow-rope into the wave. Once the surfer is in the wave, the rope is dropped. The surfer is then on their own to surf some of the biggest waves in the world.

==Differences==
Tow-in surfing differs from regular surfing in several different ways. First, the waves are much larger; a surfer has to be towed in to the wave, and there is the risk of a wall of water the size of a three-story building falling down on them. Laird Hamilton said “The sensation is a combination of flying, sailing and just going as fast as you&#x27;ve ever been. Really, it’s just the sensation of speed.”

==Controversy==
Critics of tow-in surfing decry the noise and exhaust fumes made by PWC engines, as well as the likelihood that new participants can get into predicaments that they have not been trained or conditioned to survive. On the other hand, a skilled team of driver and surfer, who often swap roles in the water during a session, develop a rapport and an understanding of ocean conditions that allows them to proactively watch out for each other.

Environmentalists and surfing purists have passed a proposal to shut down tow-in surfing at Mavericks in Northern California, saying that is hazardous to local wildlife and a nuisance to residents.

<doc id="1001237" wikidata="Q5393727" url="?curid=1001237" title="HMS Albemarle (1901)">
<text>HMS &quot;Albemarle&quot; was a pre-dreadnought of the Royal Navy, named after George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. Built to counter a group of fast Russian battleships, &quot;Albemarle&quot; and her sister ships were capable of steaming at , making them the fastest battleships in the world. The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to the s, though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout. As such, they reflected a development of the lighter second-class ships of the . &quot;Albemarle&quot; was built between her keel laying in January 1900 and her completion in November 1903.

&quot;Albemarle&quot; had a fairly uneventful career. She spent her first years in service with the Mediterranean Fleet from 1903 to 1905, when she was transferred to the Channel Fleet. In 1907, she was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet; in early 1910 she transferred to the Home Fleet, first as part of the 4th Battle Squadron and later the 6th Battle Squadron. She served with the Grand Fleet on the Northern Patrol during the early stages of the First World War. She was later dispatched to Murmansk in Russia for guard and icebreaking duties for most of 1916. On her return to England, she underwent a refit and was in reserve for the remainder of the war. Decommissioned in April 1919, she was scrapped in 1920.

==Design==


The six ships of the were ordered in response to the Russian s that had been launched in 1898. The Russian ships were fast second-class battleships, so William Henry White, the British Director of Naval Construction, designed the &quot;Duncan&quot; class to match the purported top speed of the Russian vessels. To achieve the higher speed while keeping displacement from growing, White was forced to reduce the ships&#x27; armour protection significantly, effectively making the ships enlarged and improved versions of the s of 1896, rather than derivatives of the more powerful , , and series of first-class battleships. The &quot;Duncan&quot;s proved to be disappointments in service, owing to their reduced defensive characteristics, though they were still markedly superior to the &quot;Peresvet&quot;s they had been built to counter.

&quot;Albemarle&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 720 officers and ratings. The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by 24 Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from . This made &quot;Albemarle&quot; and her sisters the fastest battleships in the world for several years. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for .

&quot;Albemarle&quot; had a main battery of four  40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull.

&quot;Albemarle&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkhead on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets&#x27; sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Operational history==
===Pre-First World War===
HMS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, named for George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, was laid down on 1 January 1900 at Chatham Dockyard, and launched on 5 March 1901, when Lady Kennedy, wife of Admiral Sir William Kennedy, Commander-in-Chief of the Nore, performed the christening. She was completed in November 1903. &quot;Albemarle&quot; was commissioned at Chatham Dockyard on 12 November 1903 for service as Flag extra, Rear Admiral, for the second division of the Mediterranean Fleet. In February 1905 she was transferred to the Channel Fleet to serve as 2nd Flagship for the fleet&#x27;s deputy commander. She was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 31 January 1907, serving as 2nd Flagship there as well. Under Captain Robert Falcon Scott″s command, she collided with the battleship on 11 February 1907, suffering minor bow damage.

In July 1908, &quot;Albemarle&quot; visited Canada during the Quebec Tercentenary, in company with her sister ships , , and . She became Flagship, Rear Admiral, at Gibraltar in January 1909 and went to Malta for a refit from May through August 1909. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended in February 1910. On 25 February 1910, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was recommissioned for service in the 3rd Division, Home Fleet, at Portsmouth. She was paid off at Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit on 30 October 1911; the refit lasted from January to December 1912. Her refit complete, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was recommissioned at Portsmouth to serve in the 4th Battle Squadron in the First Fleet there. On 15 May 1913, she was reduced to a nucleus crew and assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron, Second Fleet, to serve as a gunnery training ship.

===First World War===
When the First World War began in August 1914, plans originally called for &quot;Albemarle&quot; and battleships , , , , , and to form the 6th Battle Squadron and serve in the Channel Fleet, where it was to patrol the English Channel and cover the movement of the British Expeditionary Force to France. However, plans also existed for the 6th Battle Squadron to be assigned to the Grand Fleet, and, when the war began, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, requested that &quot;Albemarle&quot; and her four surviving sister ships of the &quot;Duncan&quot; class (&quot;Cornwallis&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, &quot;Exmouth&quot;, and &quot;Russell&quot;) be assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet for patrol duties to make up for the Grand Fleet&#x27;s shortage of cruisers. Accordingly, the 6th Battle Squadron was abolished temporarily, and &quot;Albemarle&quot; joined the 3rd Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow on 8 August 1914, and worked with Grand Fleet cruisers on the Northern Patrol.

&quot;Albemarle&quot; and her four &quot;Duncan&quot;-class sisters, as well as the battleships of the , temporarily were transferred to the Channel Fleet on 2 November 1914 to reinforce that fleet in the face of Imperial German Navy activity in the Channel Fleet&#x27;s area. The following day, the German fleet raided Yarmouth; at the time, &quot;Albemarle&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Squadron were dispersed on the Northern Patrol, and were thus unavailable during the German attack. On 13 November 1914, the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships returned to the Grand Fleet, but &quot;Albemarle&quot; and the other &quot;Duncan&quot;s stayed in the Channel Fleet, where they reconstituted the 6th Battle Squadron on 14 November 1914. This squadron was given a mission of bombarding German submarine bases on the coast of Belgium, and was based at Portland, although it transferred to Dover immediately on 14 November 1914. However, due to a lack of anti-submarine defenses at Dover, particularly after the harbour&#x27;s anti-submarine boom was swept away in a gale, the squadron returned to Portland on 19 November 1914. The squadron was intended to guard against an attempt by the German fleet to land an invasion force in Britain.

The 6th Battle Squadron returned to Dover in December 1914, then transferred to Sheerness on 30 December 1914 to relieve the 5th Battle Squadron there in guarding against a German invasion of the United Kingdom. Between January and May 1915, the 6th Battle Squadron was dispersed. &quot;Albemarle&quot; left the squadron in April 1915 and rejoined the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet. She underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard in October 1915. In November 1915, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was ordered to move to the Mediterranean with a division of the 3rd Battle Squadron that also included the battleships (the flagship), &quot;Zealandia&quot;, and &quot;Russell&quot;. The ships left Scapa Flow on 6 November 1915, but encountered extremely heavy weather that night in the Pentland Firth. &quot;Albemarle&quot;, heavily loaded with spare ammunition, suffered severe damage early on 7 November in the rough seas, having her forward bridge washed away, killing all of her bridge personnel. Her forward superstructure was also badly damaged in the incident.

When her repairs were complete in December 1915, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was ordered to rejoin the Grand Fleet. She thus became the only &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ship (other than , which had been wrecked before the war) with no wartime Mediterranean service. In January 1916, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was detached from the Grand Fleet to serve in North Russia at Murmansk as a guard ship and as an icebreaker in the approaches to Arkhangelsk. At Murmansk, she also served as flagship of Senior Naval Officer, Murmansk. &quot;Albemarle&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in September 1916, paying off at Portsmouth to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. She began a refit at Liverpool in October 1916, and upon its completion in March 1917 she went into reserve at Devonport Dockyard; her main-deck casemate 6-inch guns were removed and replaced with four 6-inch guns on her battery deck between September 1916 and May 1917. &quot;Albemarle&quot; was in reserve until April 1919, used as an overflow accommodation ship for the naval barracks at Devonport, and was attached to the Gunnery School in 1919. The ship was placed on the disposal list in April 1919 and on the sale list in August 1919. She was sold for scrapping to Cohen Shipbeaking Company on 19 November 1919 and arrived at Swansea for scrapping in April 1920.

<text>This is a list of English-language [[small press]]es, small publishers, current or past, that have published (printed) works of fiction and nonfiction, poetry, short stories, essays, pamphlets, limited edition or collectible books and chapbooks, and other forms of literature. In addition to publishing few books per year, the print runs of their titles are often smaller than for books from larger publishers. This list does include periodic publishers of poetry, and literature journals and magazines, including alternative comic books. This list does not include exclusively online publishers, academic publishers (who often publish very limited print runs, but for a different market), or businesses operating solely as printers, such as print-on-demand companies or vanity presses.

<doc id="1001247" wikidata="Q5457222" url="?curid=1001247" title="Flaming Carrot Comics">
<text>Flaming Carrot Comics is an American superhero comic book created by Bob Burden, featuring the absurd, surreal adventures of the Flaming Carrot.

The series first appeared in &quot;Visions&quot; #1, a magazine-size comic book publication. Flaming Carrot chronicled &quot;the further adventures of the strangest man alive&quot;. Flaming Carrot is often noted for his distinctive exclamation &quot;Ut!&quot; Flaming Carrot adventures have been published by Aardvark-Vanaheim, Renegade Press, Dark Horse Comics, and Image Comics, among others. He has guest-starred and made cameos in comics published by Fantagraphics, Mirage Studios, Atomeka Press, and others.

==Concept and themes==
The Flaming Carrot was in part inspired by the obscure Golden Age character The Fin. Burden recounted &quot;I took this particular idea and scratched it down one night when I came home about three o&#x27;clock in the morning. I&#x27;d been out on the town all night, and it was one of those nights when I came home tired and fell asleep with my clothes on.&quot; When asked to explain the meaning of the character&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Ut!&quot;, he stated: 
&quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot; and Burden&#x27;s spin-off &quot;Mysterymen&quot; project went on to forsake the elitist, perfection-oriented traditional superheroes with characters who were blue-collar, second-string, roughnecks and goofballs with mediocre powers: outcasts that couldn&#x27;t make it into the major leagues but saved people, risked everything and fought evil.

Hailing from rust-belt mill towns and backwater boondocks of America, Flaming Carrot and his fellow Mysterymen were irreverent, carousing, hard-drinking, ruffians and rabble-rousers, hammering square pegs into round holes, dodging lawsuits, cutting up, skirting the thin line between good and evil and earning a hot meal, a refreshing cocktail and some romance now and then.

Burden commented that &quot;our theme was do the best you can with what you got, never leave a pal behind, lost causes are sometimes the best ones and keep it fun. I&#x27;d say, Flaming Carrot was to the regular superheroes what Huckleberry Finn was to Tom Sawyer&quot;.

==Publication history==
The Flaming Carrot first appeared in &quot;Visions&quot; #1 (1979), a direct-market magazine and in subsequent yearly issues that eventually became the program booklet of the Atlanta Fantasy Fair, with Flaming Carrot stories went on to appear in each yearly edition of the magazine through 1987. Bob Burden illustrated and wrote the book, with lettering by Roxanne Starr, who went on to be one of the first pioneers of computer lettering.

In 1981, Burden, under the company name Killian Barracks Press, self-published &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot; #1, an oversized one-shot. Four to eight-page Flaming Carrot stories appeared in each subsequent annual issue of &quot;Visions&quot; through #4 (1982), that last of which contained an apocryphal Flaming Carrot history that convinced Dave Sim, of the self-publishing company Aardvark-Vanaheim, to publish Flaming Carrot as a regular comic, First, however, Sim included back-up stories of the Carrot in the pages of Aardvark-Vanaheim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus&quot;&#x27; #61–62 (cover-dated April–May 1984). The Carrot eventually guest starred in the series proper in &quot;Cerebus&quot; #104 (Nov. 1987).

In the meantime, Aardvark-Vanaheim had published &quot;Flaming Carrot&quot; #1-5 (May 1984 - Jan. 1985). The company also published a 3-D special, &quot;A-V In 3-D&quot; #1 (Dec. 1984).

After Dave Sim and Deni Loubert, the couple behind Aardvark-Vanaheim, divorced, Loubert established Renegade Press to publish all of Aardvark-Vanaheim&#x27;s former titles apart from &quot;Cerebus&quot;. Flaming Carrot was one of these, and remained with Renegade until the publisher went bankrupt in 1988. Renegade published issues #6-17 (March 1985 - July 1987). Burden also published a short Flaming Carrot piece in the Fantagraphics anthology &quot;Anything Goes!&quot; (Oct. 1986).

After Renegade, Burden took Flaming Carrot to Dark Horse Comics, which published 14 more issues of &quot;Flaming Carrot&quot;, #18-31 (June 1988 to Oct. 1994). Dark Horse also published Flaming Carrot stories in its anthology &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #20 (Aug. 1988) and its annual anthology &quot;San Diego Comic Con Comics&quot; #1.

Following issue #31 in 1994, the character appeared only sporadically in one-shots over the next decade as Burden focused on writing stories for a number of new properties including a new Mysterymen comic series. In winter 1994, Bob Burden self-published &quot;Flaming Carrot Stories No. 1&quot;, referred to on the cover as a &quot;Text Version of Future Issue&quot;. From 1997-1998, the company published four volumes of the &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics Collected Album&quot;, which was the first time the series had been reprinted, and the 64-page &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics Annual No.1&quot;, featuring a new story. In 1999, Dark Horse published four issues of the spin-off series &quot;Bob Burden&#x27;s Original Mysterymen Comics&quot;, which did not feature the Flaming Carrot. In 2002, Dark Horse published the crossover special &quot;Flaming Carrot &amp; Reid Fleming, World&#x27;s Toughest Milkman&quot;, listed as Flaming Carrot Comics #32 in the indicia.

In 1993–1994, Mirage Studios published the four-issue series &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles / Flaming Carrot Crossover&quot;. Burden did not do the art for this series, however.

&quot;Flaming Carrot&quot; was relaunched in 2004 with Image Comics and Desperado Publishing. This series lasted two years, comprising four issues (simultaneously numbered #1-4, and #33-36).

The final appearance of Flaming Carrot was the 2006 &quot;Photo Comic Special #1&quot; (#37), featuring &quot;fumetti&quot; style of storytelling using photographs instead of illustration, in conjunction with Sam Gaffin and his Killer Robots project.

==Fictional character biography==
The Flaming Carrot origin states that &quot;having read 5,000 comics in a single sitting to win a bet, this poor man suffered brain damage and appeared directly thereafter as—the Flaming Carrot!&quot;.

Flaming Carrot&#x27;s villains include the likes of the Artless Dodger, Don Wiskerando, The Bicycle Thief, Garbage Mouth, Mr. Chicken Pants, a giant spider with diapers on, and many others. The Carrot, who lives in Palookaville, a blue-collar district of rust-belt era Iron City, has staved off at least three alien invasions, a Communist takeover of Iron City, flying dead dogs, the Man in the Moon, Death itself, and a cloned horde of evil marching Hitler&#x27;s boots. Flaming Carrot even died in #6 by falling into a deep toxic waste pit in Palookaville, but was brought back from clinical death in #7, described his sojourn in Limbo in #8 and got back at those who sent him to Limbo in #9.

Flaming Carrot was also a founding member of the blue collar superhero group the Mystery Men, introduced in a flashback/dream sequence in &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot; #16. The story of this group was later made into the 1999 film &quot;Mystery Men&quot; and a short-lived spin-off comic book series. The Flaming Carrot himself does not appear in the film, although a handful of characters like Mr. Furious, the Shoveler, and Dr. Heller do. The Blue Raja character serves as the Flaming Carrot&#x27;s stand-in.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Carrot wears a costume that consists of a giant carrot mask which extends from above his head to below his crotch, a white shirt, red pants, and flippers on his feet (in case he has to swim). The mask has a continually burning flame at the top and a secret compartment containing a nuclear-powered pogo stick (the mask and the pogo stick were invented by Dr. Heller of the Mystery Men). The Flaming Carrot also wears a crime fighting utility belt which is filled with Silly Putty, rubber bands, laughing gas, random playing cards, sneezing powder, and other similarly frivolous items. Dr. Heller upgraded Flaming Carrot&#x27;s equipment after bringing him back from the clinically dead. The Flaming Carrot also relies heavily on his 9mm Radom pistol to kill his enemies.

The Flaming Carrot is able to go into a self-induced state of &quot;Zen Stupidity&quot; in order to face danger and evil boldly and without trepidation.

== Legacy ==

Flaming Carrot’s unpredictable antics, irreverent humor, fantastic characters and surreal storylines engendered a cult following and legendary status that still exists to this day. Burden attributes his longevity and success to the storytelling more than anything else: &quot;The stories seem, at first glance, non-linear and spontaneous, and in truth they start that way, but they are really linear. I always somehow manage to orchestrate a beginning, middle and end. I believe I was born a natural storyteller, but journalism school and the Robert McKee books and writing seminars didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Studying is not about memorizing or mimicking the methods of others. When trying to mentor young, new artists, my main objective is to teach them to teach themselves, to also learn on their own and experiment, take risks... just use knowledge as a jumping off point for wisdom. And always remember, no matter how hard it seems, it&#x27;s also got to be fun. Never lose sight of that.&quot;

Like the primitive, raw New Wave music of the early 80s spawned from the art-student/garage-band movement, the New Wave comics championed creativity over musical experience and expertise. Flaming Carrot was one of the founding elements of the New Wave in comics, where independent, self-published, outside-the-box, creators wrote books that rebooted, reformatted and revived the comics industry. Burden never went to art school or took lessons, but collected and studied original comic art and took tips and critiques from experienced comic and art mentors like Jim Steranko, Stanislav Szukalski and Steve Ditko.

Working outside of the company environment and skirting the creative hegemony of caution and apprehension that is born out of corporate liability and fear, the &quot;Indi Comics&quot; creators of the early 80s set a trend of more literary, more creative and more fun stories for the medium, with a fresh, novel approach to comics: one that brought in new, older and more diverse elements, and set new standards for the traditional, corporate elements of the comics industry to live up to.

The early, pioneering, and seminal New Wave/independent books like &quot;Cerebus The Aardvark&quot; and &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot; served as &quot;missing links&quot; to the heritage of the then fading Underground comics. Books like Flaming Carrot carried on the explorations and off-the-wall forays of the preceding undergrounds, and revived the sense of freedom and creativity that the undergrounds had instigated.

Eventually, the comic revolution of the early 80s was absorbed and co-opted by the big companies and the mainstream comics industry, but not before giving inspiration to more commercial properties like &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Spawn&quot; and &quot;The Crow&quot;, all of which crowned and validated the indie comics movement with mass-market success. In Burden&#x27;s commentary: &quot;Even Flaming Carrot succumbed to the pop comics frenzy with the 60 million-dollar spin-off Mystery Men movie from Universal. But walk down artist alley at any comic convention and there&#x27;s a whole new generation of go-getters and story-tellers sharpening their pencils with a pocket knife, publishing their own short run books, having fun and ready to take on the world&quot;.

<doc id="1001250" wikidata="Q2479104" url="?curid=1001250" title="Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle">
<text>The Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV) is a fictional pursuit and attack vehicle from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson&#x27;s 1960s science fiction television series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;.

==Origin and design==
In 2002, Gerry Anderson explained how the vehicle&#x27;s safety features were borne out of his &quot;preoccupation&quot; – demonstrated in various aspects of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; – &quot;with things not being what they seemed ...With a flick of a switch the walls of these buildings would collapse to reveal this astonishing vehicle inside. I knew kids would find that exciting.&quot; He quickly regretted his decision to make the seats rear-facing, commenting: &quot; ... we began to realise that the audience was going to say, &#x27;Why are these people facing backwards?&#x27; So we wrote an explanation into the first script. Then I realised that not everyone would have seen that episode so we had to put explanations in again and again.&quot;

The SPV was designed by special effects director Derek Meddings based on a brief description given in the Andersons&#x27; original script for the first episode, which specified only that the SPV was a high-speed armoured vehicle with reversed seating (and therefore no windscreen), running on a removable &quot;lightweight power unit&quot;. Noting that the occupants faced backwards and viewed the road through a TV monitor, Meddings said that &quot;all [this] meant to me was that I could design the vehicle without windows.&quot; For added realism, these were replaced with grilles and air vents.

To fulfil his vision of a &quot;menacing, shark-like&quot; assault vehicle, Meddings added a tail fin to the design. He also incorporated a broad front bumper, intended to be shock-absorbent, and five pairs of wheels (in two sizes), as he thought that vehicles with a large number of wheels &quot;looked more interesting on screen.&quot; He said that he was pleased with the SPV design because he believed that it &quot;could be filmed from any angle&quot;.

Several filming models were built. They were made of either balsa or hardwood in a range of scales, the largest being long.

==Depiction==
Spectrum&#x27;s main armoured land vehicle, the SPV is an amphibious, all-terrain machine that can be driven in extreme environments as well as in cities. It is long and has a maximum speed of either on land. It is fitted with five pairs of wheels (the three over the front, middle and rear axles constituting the main drive), with additional traction for mountainous environments provided by rear-mounted, hydraulically-lowered caterpillar tracks.

Within the hermetically-sealed cabin, the driver, co-driver and a passenger are seated backwards, facing the rear, to reduce the possibility of injury in the event of a crash. The driver is aided by a video monitor displaying horizontally-flipped front and rear views. The SPV is armed with a front-mounted rocket cannon, housed underneath a foldaway panel, and is also equipped with a radar system and ejector seats. The hydrogenic power unit can be removed and re-assembled as a personal jet pack or other devices of comparable size, components for which are stored in the vehicle&#x27;s rear compartment.

SPVs are distributed worldwide and are requisitioned from disguised buildings and other structures, guarded by undercover operatives. A Spectrum agent can access an SPV only upon presenting his or her identification. 

==Reception and influence==
James Taylor of &quot;Car&quot; magazine ranks the SPV as one of the top ten vehicles in Gerry Anderson productions. On the vehicle&#x27;s design, he comments that &quot;all-round visibility [was] clearly not a priority of Captain Scarlet&#x27;s employers.&quot; Andrew Blair of website Den of Geek calls the SPV &quot;clearly the best vehicle&quot; in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. Comparing it to &quot;a tank driven at ludicrous speeds, while facing backwards and located in secret garages around the world&quot;, he argues that the vehicle represents &quot;probably the fastest transformation from covert to ridiculously unsubtle that fiction has ever seen.&quot; Tat Wood of &quot;TV Zone&quot; magazine questions Spectrum&#x27;s logic in keeping its SPVs hidden until they are needed (&quot;inside caravans, gasometers, tubes of Pringles or wherever&quot;) given that they are &quot;then abandoned on the road&quot;.

The rear-facing system is praised by commentators Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, who credit the feature as an innovative &quot;work of genius&quot;. Drawing a parallel between Anderson&#x27;s comments on aircraft design and the Paul Klee monoprint &quot;Angelus Novus&quot;, Mark Bould of the University of the West of England argues that the system is &quot;full of metaphorical potential&quot; in that it represents Anderson &quot;[promulgating] a naive vision of progress while reinforcing the status quo. Consequently, while the SPV driver [...] might be oriented like the angel of history, he is incapable of seeing what lies behind its forward thrust. Not for him the catastrophe accumulating in his wake; just the deceptively uncluttered road ahead. His [monitor] screen &quot;screens&quot;: it shows and it obscures. And in such an echo chamber, as Benjamin&#x27;s fifth thesis notes, &#x27;every image of the past that is not recognised by the present as one of its own concerns, threatens to disappear irretrievably.&#x27;&quot;

The SPV&#x27;s curved front bumper inspired the rounded edges of LaCie&#x27;s &quot;Rugged&quot; external hard drive, designed by Neil Poulton.

In 2022, YouTuber Tom Scott published a video in which he and a tech company build a go-kart with backwards-facing driver and passenger seats, similar to the SPV. Motorsport Network reported that the experiment had been a success: &quot;It&#x27;s a little tricky for the mind, especially at higher speeds, but everything works as it should. Does it make any sense? No, not all. But is it fun? A hundred percent.&quot;

In a preview of the Polestar 4, Andrew English of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; compared the car&#x27;s lack of a rear window in favour of an external camera system to an SPV driver&#x27;s reliance on a video monitor while seated backwards.

===Toys and model kits===
Several toys and miniature models of the SPV have been released. These include a 1960s friction-drive toy by Century 21 Toys and die-cast models by Dinky, as well as newer versions by Corgi, Vivid Imaginations and Product Enterprise. Japanese company Imai released a model kit version in 1993.

The Dinky toy included a spring-fired missile and other action features. It remained on sale until 1975 and became the company&#x27;s best-selling toy of all time, as well as one of the most popular die-cast toys ever made in the UK.

The 2003 version by Product Enterprise was larger than the earlier toys and given a duller spray finish. A 2023 &quot;Diecast Collector&quot; review of the product described it as &quot;[i]n some ways [...] the best SPV model ever made, certainly in terms of detail and build quality&quot;, but criticised its &quot;dusty, weathered&quot; and &quot;grubby&quot; look. Corgi released an updated version in 2024.

==The Rhino==
In the animated remake &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot; (2005), the SPV is replaced by the Spectrum Rhino. The Rhino is more heavily armed than the SPV, and unlike the original is incapable of travelling on water. Instead of being hidden in safehouses, it is deployed from Skybase via &quot;Albatross&quot; dropships. Rhino drivers adopt a forward-facing driving position, unlike their predecessors.

<text>Robert Bruce Spencer (born February 27, 1962) is an American anti-Muslim author and blogger, and one of the key figures of the counter-jihad movement. Spencer founded and has directed the blog &quot;Jihad Watch&quot; since 2003. In 2010 he co-founded the organization Stop Islamization of America with Pamela Geller.

Three of Spencer&#x27;s books reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Reports that two of Spencer&#x27;s books were listed in FBI training materials and that he had given seminars to various law enforcement units in the United States stirred controversy. In 2013, the UK Home Office barred Spencer from travel to the United Kingdom for three to five years for &quot;making statements that may foster hatred that might lead to inter-community violence&quot;. He has frequently appeared on Fox News.

==Background==
Spencer was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church and joined the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in 1984. Spencer has stated that, under the reign of President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, his grandparents were forced to emigrate from an area that is now part of Turkey because they were Christians. Spencer&#x27;s father worked for Voice of America during the Cold War, and in his younger days, Spencer himself worked at Revolution Books, a Maoist bookstore in New York City founded by Robert Avakian.

Spencer received an M.A. in 1986 in religious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His masters thesis was on monophysitism and the history of the Catholic Church.

Spencer has been harshly criticized by several clerics of the Roman Catholic Church because of his views on Islam. In 2016, as a result of &quot;personal reflection and historical study&quot;, Spencer returned to the Greek Orthodox Church.

==Activities and writings==
Spencer has been studying Islamic theology, law, and history since 1980, but his publications on Islam and Muslims have not undergone academic peer review. They have been published by publishing houses that specialize in the writings of political conservatives, mostly Regnery Publishing or Bombardier Books. He worked in think tanks for more than 20 years, and in 2002–2003 was an adjunct fellow with the Free Congress Foundation.

A 2010 investigative report by &quot;The Tennessean&quot; described Spencer as one of several individuals who &quot;cash in on spreading hate and fear about Islam.&quot; The &quot;Tennessean&quot; investigation concluded: &quot;IRS filings from 2008 show that Robert Spencer earned $132,537 from the David Horowitz Freedom Center.&quot; In addition to being the editor for the David Horowitz Freedom Center&#x27;s &quot;Jihad Watch&quot; blog, Spencer has also written for &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, and has been a columnist for &quot;Human Events&quot;, &quot;PJ Media&quot; and &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;.

Spencer co-founded the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America (also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative) with Pamela Geller in 2010. The organization is designated as a &quot;hate group&quot; by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Together with Geller he led a campaign to stop the building of Park51, an Islamic community center near the World Trade Center, which they referred to as the &quot;Ground Zero Mosque&quot;, claiming that imam Feisal Abdul Rauf planned to build a &quot;victory mosque&quot; to celebrate the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks.

===Ban from entering the UK===
On June 26, 2013, both Spencer and Pamela Geller were banned from entering the UK. They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, south London, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed by an Islamist. Home Secretary Theresa May informed Spencer and Geller that their presence in the UK would &quot;not be conducive to the public good&quot;. A letter from the UK Home Office stated that this decision is based on Spencer&#x27;s statement that Islam &quot;is a religion or a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers for the purpose of establishing a societal model that is absolutely incompatible with Western society. ...Because of media and general government unwillingness to face the sources of Islamic terrorism, these things remain largely unknown.&quot; The decision was to stand for between three and five years. The ban followed a concerted campaign by the UK anti-racism organization Hope not Hate, which said it had collected 26,000 signatures for a petition to the Home Secretary. Spencer and Geller contested the ban, but in 2015 the British Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, arguing that &quot;this was a public order case where the police had advised that significant public disorder and serious violence might ensue from the proposed visit.&quot;

The ban was criticized by author Douglas Murray. He has stated his belief that because Islamic supremacist hate preachers were and are still allowed to enter the UK, and because what Geller and Spencer say is much less objectionable than the views and statements of extremist Muslim clerics such as Muhammad al-Arefe (who was allowed to enter the UK shortly before Spencer and Geller were banned), the ban is unjust. Spencer responded to the ban by stating that the UK had become a &quot;de facto Islamic state&quot;.

The government of Pakistan previously banned Spencer&#x27;s book, &quot;The Truth About Muhammad&quot;, in 2007, citing &quot;objectionable material&quot; as the cause. His book &quot;Onward Muslim Soldiers&quot; was banned in Malaysia the same year.

===Speaking engagements===

Spencer spoke at Truman State University in April 2017 despite protests and a petition against him, having been invited by the Young America&#x27;s Foundation. He spoke at the University of Buffalo in May the same year, where he was shouted down and heckled. He also spoke at Gettysburg College two days later; 375 alumni urged the college president Janet Morgan Riggs to cancel the speech, but the event went on as planned. Spencer said, &quot;There is one kind of diversity that is not valued generally in an academic setting and that is intellectual diversity.&quot; Spencer spoke at Stanford University in November 2017, during which a group of students walked out.

Spencer has said that &quot;a young Icelandic Leftist&quot; poisoned him in 2017 in Reykjavik, Iceland, after a speaking event where he warned Icelanders of the dangers of &quot;the impact of Islam&quot; on Icelandic society. A medical report indicated he had been given MDMA and amphetamines.

Spencer became a senior fellow of Frank Gaffney&#x27;s Center for Security Policy in 2020, after years of consultations with the group. He is also a frequent guest on Gaffney&#x27;s Secure Freedom Radio and Securing America TV.

==Influence and criticism==
Spencer is known for his anti-Muslim views. He comments on radical Islam, Islamic extremism, Islamic terrorism, and Islamic supremacism. His main thesis is that Islam is an inherently violent religion, and that extremists who commit acts of terror are simply following Islam&#x27;s most authentic version. According to author Todd H. Green, Spencer&#x27;s commentary on Islam has been regarded as &quot;hav[ing] made a huge impact on the misinformation about Islam that circulates so freely on the Internet, in the media, and in political circles.&quot;

Spencer&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Stealth Jihad: How Radical Islam is Subverting America without Guns or Bombs&quot; has been seen to have developed one of the most important ideas of the counter-jihad, namely the &quot;stealth jihad&quot; idea that &quot;terrorists aren&#x27;t America&#x27;s real Muslim problem&quot;, writing that &quot;distracted by foreign wars and the prospect of domestic terror attacks, Americans pay little heed to the true agents of intolerance in their midst&quot;, namely the Muslim Brotherhood and its alleged American offshoots such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC).

The perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, cited Robert Spencer 64 times in his manifesto and wrote of him: &quot;About Islam I recommend essentially everything written by Robert Spencer.&quot; Spencer condemned Breivik and said he was unfairly blamed by the media for the attack, likening it to Charles Manson drawing inspiration from The Beatles. Breivik has later admitted that he has been a neo-Nazi since the early 1990s, who only in later years exploited counter-jihad writings.

In July 2011, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported that two of Spencer&#x27;s books were listed in FBI training materials. Both &quot;The Truth About Muhammad&quot; and &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam&quot; were recommended for agents hoping to better understand Islam. His books were later dropped from federal training programs.

<text>The Kelmscott Press, founded by William Morris and Emery Walker, published 53 books in 66 volumes between 1891 and 1898. Each book was designed and ornamented by Morris and printed by hand in limited editions of around 300. Many books were illustrated by Edward Burne-Jones. Kelmscott Press books sought to replicate the style of 15th-century printing and were part of the Gothic revival movement. Kelmscott Press started the contemporary fine press movement, which focuses on the craft and design of bookmaking, often using hand presses. While their most famous books are richly decorated, most Kelmscott Press books did not have elaborate decoration, but were published simply.

Morris was interested in medieval book design, visiting the Bodleian Library often with Burne-Jones to examine illuminated manuscripts. He designed and published several books before founding Kelmscott Press. Book dealers and designers complained about the poor quality of books published on the new rotary printing presses; Morris agreed that their quality was poor. After attending a lecture by Emery Walker on book design, Morris was inspired to collaborate with him on a new font of type, and their collaboration led to the founding of the Kelmscott Press, named after Kelmscott Manor, Morris&#x27;s home in Oxfordshire.

Walker enlarged photographs of fine typefaces for Morris to trace and take inspiration from. Morris then drew his new font design at the enlarged size, which Walker in turn reduced. All three of Morris&#x27;s fonts were created this way. Morris loved the aesthetics of 15th-century books and modelled his margins and spacing after them. He put smaller spaces between words and lines to create a block of text, and had large outer margins where he put shoulder-notes. Some Kelmscott books were heavily decorated with woodblock designs created by Morris. To create the look of an uninterrupted block of text, Morris sometimes printed poetry as prose. Kelmscott Press&#x27;s most famous book was its edition of the complete works of Chaucer. The &quot;Chaucer&quot; contains 87 wood engravings by Edward Burne-Jones and many designs and initials by Morris. The book is considered a masterpiece of the fine press medium.

The Press closed shortly after Morris&#x27;s death, but has exerted a huge influence on book production throughout the world.

==Background==
Before Morris founded the Kelmscott Press, he had a strong interest in book design. Morris and Burne-Jones both admired illuminated manuscripts, and visited the Bodleian Library often to admire them. They also admired the works of Chaucer and Dürer. Morris carefully studied the techniques of the illuminators and the woodblock carvers in hopes of reviving that type of craftsmanship. Morris had some experience in contributing to and designing books before he founded the Kelmscott Press. He designed and illuminated books by hand, starting in 1870 with an anthology of his own poetry, &quot;A Book of Verse&quot;. He designed as well as wrote &quot;The House of Wolfings&quot; (1889) and &quot;The Roots of the Mountains&quot; (1890); he also designed &quot;The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue&quot; (1891). He had plans to make a richly illustrated version of his epic poem, &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot;. He abandoned the project, but surviving trial pages show that the typefaces and illustrations are &quot;incompatible&quot;.

Morris was not merely trying to replicate 15th-century printing practices. He preferred the iron hand-press of the 19th century to the medieval wooden ones, because the weaker wooden presses had to print on wet paper to get a print from a woodblock. Printing on wet paper weakened the press and subsequently, the book itself. Conveniently, iron hand-presses were still readily available in the 1890s. While modern rotary presses focused on speed and affordability, Morris did not. Some book dealers and designers disliked the newly popular, poorly-produced books. Talbot Baines Reed, in an 1890 lecture on typography at the Society of Arts, complained that new typefaces were thin, harsh, and lacking dignity compared to old-face typefaces like Caslon and those of Nicholas Jenson. Morris expressed similar opinions. 

==Founding and history==
Emery Walker, a book-collector, was friends and neighbours with Morris. In 1888, the Arts and Crafts Society sponsored several lectures including two by Walker on bookbinding and letterpress printing and illustration. His lecture included slides of books, including enlarged type to demonstrate good and bad book design. After the second lecture, Morris asked Walker to make a new font of type with him. Walker was initially skeptical, since he could not contribute capital. Walker told Morris where to buy high-quality tools and materials for printing, as well as where to hire skilled printers. In January 1891, Morris began renting a cottage near Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which would serve as the first premises of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. The Kelmscott Press was named after Kelmscott Manor, Morris&#x27;s home in Oxfordshire. While Morris did not pay himself any sort of salary, he usually broke even or made a little bit of money from the sales of Kelmscott Press books. Sales from smaller books, which were easier to produce and sell, supported production of folios and quartos. Morris organised outings for his workers and paid them above-average wages.

After Morris&#x27;s death in 1896, Cockerell and Walker finished the last five volumes of &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot; and ten other titles. Some had already been started or were in planning stages at the time of Morris&#x27;s death. They lacked the decorations that Morris usually created for Kelmscott books.

==Design==
While the Kelmscott Press is most well known for its large folio of the complete works of Chaucer, complete with many wood engravings, most of the books Kelmscott Press published were octavos that were not illustrated. Morris believed that any printer could improve their design by using old-style types and placing the page of type closer to the spine than the outside edge, as was the custom in 15th-century printing. Morris advised others to print without ornament, but he did not follow this advice when printing books at the Kelmscott Press.

The hand press allowed Morris to use wood-engraved initials and borders, and its printing was blacker than a power-driven press. Morris printed on dampened handmade paper, creating indentations in the page. Morris believed that the indentations were an important part of the book&#x27;s design, telling customers that &quot;The Gold Legend&quot; should not be pressed, which would have made the pages artificially smooth. Morris referred to selling books untrimmed and unbound, assuming that his buyers would rebind them. After finding out that most buyers did not rebind the books, Morris started trimming the deckle-edged edges after publishing &quot;Biblia innocentium&quot;. While Morris and Walker preferred paper in their books, they printed several copies of books on vellum for collectors. Vellum was difficult to print on compared to paper. Morris started using a thick, dark ink that came from a German supplier in Hannover in 1893. The pressmen had difficulty working with the stiff ink. Morris went back to using ink from Shackell, Edwards, and Co., until 1895 when they discovered yellow staining on some pages of the &quot;Chaucer&quot;. Morris asked the supplier in Hannover for a softer version of the ink, which he used for the rest of &quot;Chaucer&quot;. The softer ink did not dry very quickly, and Morris told customers that the book would not be ready for traditional binding until a year after its printing. Morris used red ink for titles and shoulder-notes. He experimented with other colors, but did not adopt them.

Walker influenced Morris&#x27;s opinions on book design. In the 1880s, Walker supported a return to 15th-century aesthetics. He believed printers should put smaller spaces between words and after punctuation. Morris adopted the practice of smaller spaces between words and between lines, although it affected the legibility of the Kelmscott books. While the fifteenth-century books probably reduced spacing to conserve paper, Morris&#x27;s insistence was based on his preference for the way the printed page looked with fewer spaces. Morris stated that the margins closest to the binding must be the smallest, followed by the head, fore (outer) and tail margins. Experts in medieval printing stated that the difference between the margins was usually less than twenty percent. In practice, Morris&#x27;s fore margins were large to accommodate the shoulder-notes recommended by Walker instead of running titles. Morris left so little inner margin that rebinding was difficult. Morris published poetry in a prose style several times, presumably to avoid empty space on the page.

===Fonts===
Morris designed three typefaces for Kelmscott Press: Golden Type, Troy, and a smaller version of Troy called Chaucer. After deciding to found the press, Morris collected many books printed in the 15th century in Europe. He also had many books on printing and typography. In researching typefaces, Morris bought examples of every fine type he could find. Morris started designing his press&#x27;s first typeface, Golden Type, by 1889. Walker&#x27;s firm photographed the type at a large scale to help Morris see the actual shape of the letters. Golden Type was a Roman type inspired by a font used in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Historicae naturalis&quot; published by Nicolas Jenson and a similar font that Jacobus Rubeus used in publishing &quot;Historiae Florentini populi&quot; by Leonardus Brunus Aretinus. Morris stated that designing Golden Type was &quot;the most troublesome task&quot; he had ever tried. Morris traced the enlarged type until he felt comfortable with his understanding of the design. After freehanding his own design at the same scale, Walker photographed the drawings and reproduced them in the correct scale. Morris made modifications at every stage. Morris and Walker pioneered this method of working on typefaces at an enlarged size with the camera. Peterson notes that even though Morris and the Kelmscott Press was focused on returning to 15th-century designs, they still used the modern Victorian technology of photography in its art. Edward Prince, a craftsman who cut typefaces for many other fine presses, cut the punches for the type in 1890. Sir Charles Reed and Sons carried out the casting, and the font, in 14-point size, was completed in the winter of 1890–1891. With Golden Type, Morris did not make an italic or bold version and did not include brackets or dashes. The thickness of the font went well with the wood-engravings it often accompanied. Critics noted that its larger size and width discouraged commercial application. Stanley Morison strongly disliked it and criticized its large capital letters.

After Golden Type, Morris developed Troy, a &quot;semi-Gothic type designed [...] with special regard to legibility&quot;, according to Morris. Morris used the same method he used to develop Golden Type as he did with Troy. He was influenced by books published by Shoeffer and Zainer. His illness delayed the font&#x27;s development and the 18-point font was completed in 1892. He developed a 12-point version of Troy for the complete works of Chaucer, also called the Kelmscott Chaucer. He called the font the Chaucer. Because of these wide fonts, the books themselves had to be wide too. Morris bought handmade paper from Joseph Batchelor and Son. They used watermarks designed by Morris and provided him with paper in unusual sizes. Other booksellers admired the paper, leading to imitators. At Morris&#x27;s suggestion, Batchelor adopted the name Kelmscott Handmade.

In the 1890s, photoengraving made it easy for entrepreneurs to copy Morris&#x27;s typefaces and sell pirated typefaces. When an American foundry offered to sell Morris&#x27;s typefaces in the United States, Morris refused. Joseph W. Phinney of the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston sold a Jenson Old Style that was very similar to Golden Type. Satanick, an imitation Troy type, was available for purchase in 1896. Morris&#x27;s own typefounders, Sir Charles Reed and Sons, started selling a Kelmscott Old Style type. Subsequently, Sydney Cockerell, the Kelmscott Press&#x27;s administrator, threatened legal action against them.

=== Decorations ===
Some of the Kelmscott books are heavily decorated, with motifs similar to Morris&#x27;s other designs for upholstery and wallpaper. In 1913, Holbrook Jackson wrote: &quot;The Kelmscott books look not only as if letter and decoration had grown one out of the other; they look as if they could go on growing.&quot; The title pages of Kelmscott books were usually decorated in a Victorian style. Morris initially designed woodblock initials that were too dark or too large for the pages they appeared on, but later became more proficient in proofing his capitals. The Kelmscott books varied greatly in ornaments; while &quot;The History of Godefrey of Boloyne&quot; is &quot;over-decorated&quot;, the first few books published by Kelmscott were sparsely decorated. Morris&#x27;s border and capital designs were very similar to his wallpaper designs, and were not illustrative of the texts they adorned. While medieval texts had delicate illuminations covering their margins, the wood engravings Morris made in imitation of them were very heavy, and created production problems in the &quot;Chaucer&quot;, requiring the hand press to be reinforced with steel because of the weight of the large ornaments. At times Morris preferred that his wood engravers replicated his designs exactly, even though this was at odds with John Ruskin&#x27;s theory that craftsmen should have influence in the final aesthetic product they help produce. Kelmscott books did not have printing on the reverse side of woodblock pages until the &quot;Chaucer&quot;, but this separation of text from illustration was precisely what Morris wanted to avoid in his book designs.

Burne-Jones, a frequent illustrator of Kelmscott books, based many of his drawings for the wood engravings on his own previous paintings. He valued these works for their decorative value over their illustrative properties, and reviewed them by looking at them upside-down.

===Printer&#x27;s marks===
Morris designed three different printer&#x27;s marks for Kelmscott Press. One was a simple text mark in a rectangle used with octavos and small quartos. The Kelmscott mark with a large rectangle and leafy background was first published in &quot;The History of Godefrey of Bolyne&quot; and was used mostly for quartos. The last printer&#x27;s mark was only used in the &quot;Chaucer&quot;.

==Works==

Kelmscott Press&#x27;s first book was one of Morris&#x27;s own novels, &quot;The Story of the Glittering Plain&quot;, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press published 23 of Morris&#x27;s books, more than those of any other author. Morris used paragraph symbols instead of indentations to achieve the blocky looks that he preferred. Morris sold the first copy to Wilfrid Scawen Blunt for one pound. Similar to the William Caxton&#x27;s renaissance printing practice, Kelmscott Press printed editions of poetry, Morris&#x27;s own works, and medieval romance and poetry. Kelmscott printed an American edition of &quot;Hand and Soul&quot; by Dante Rossetti in 1895 which was distributed by Way and Williams Publishers. The press published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various medieval texts.

===&quot;The Love-Lyrics &amp; Songs of Proteus&quot;===
William Morris&#x27;s wife, Jane Morris, helped coordinate the publication of Wilfrid Scawen Blunt&#x27;s &quot;The Love-Lyrics &amp; Songs of Proteus&quot; (1892). Blunt had many amorous relationships with women, including one with Jane Morris. Blunt often alluded to his relationships with specific women in his poetry. In a series of sonnets called &quot;Natalia&#x27;s Resurrection&quot;, a young man and a married Roman woman fall in love and can only be together after the woman&#x27;s death. Jane liked the poems, perhaps seeing herself in them, and insisted that they be added to &quot;The Love-Lyrics &amp; Songs of Proteus&quot;. Blunt&#x27;s real inspiration for the poem was likely Margaret Talbot, a different lover of his. When Talbot read &quot;Natalia&#x27;s Resurrection&quot;, she insisted that the poems not be printed, and the 18 pages of poetry that were already set in type were removed from publication.

===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===

The Kelmscott &quot;Beowulf&quot; is considered Morris&#x27;s &quot;most problematic&quot; book project. The text was based on A. J. Wyatt&#x27;s prose translation. Morris adapted the translation into verse format, and made some of the language more archaic. He developed the Troy font for the &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The 300 paper copies sold for about 2 guineas each. Morris&#x27;s biographer, E. P. Thompson, described it as &quot;perhaps the worst thing he ever wrote&quot; in 1991. &quot;Beowulf&quot; translator James M. Garnatt was disappointed with the translation, stating that it was &quot;bordering on unintelligibl[e]&quot;. When the book was first published, Theodore Watts wrote in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; that the work was a success. Andy Orchard, professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford, noted that Morris&#x27;s translation was very faithful to the original syntax and words, especially with the compounds he created like &quot;shade-goer&quot; and &quot;horn-house&quot;. According to Old English scholar Roy Liuzza, Morris tried to re-create &quot;Beowulf&quot; in a type of English that was as removed from modern English as the vernacular speech of Anglo-Saxons was from the original &quot;Beowulf&quot;. In so doing, Morris avoided romance words and wrote in an elaborate medieval style that appears to the modern reader as &quot;most obnoxious&quot;. Nevertheless, Morris was trying to &quot;make the poem speak to [him] in [his] own language.&quot; The included glossary, which Morris did not want to include, was inadequate.

===Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot;===

The Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot; used Walter William Skeat&#x27;s edition of the complete Chaucer, after explaining to the delegates of the Clarendon Press that his edition was intended to be an &quot;art object&quot; and would not compete with their six-volume edition of Skeat&#x27;s edition of Chaucer&#x27;s complete works. It contains 87 wood engravings of drawings by Edward Burne-Jones. Burne-Jones refrained from illustrating Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;base stories&quot; and avoided comical situations in his illustrations, believing that &quot;pictures are too good to be funny&quot;. He relied on his own interpretations of Chaucer for his illustrations, resulting in &quot;a peculiar sort of literalism&quot;. Burne-Jones&#x27;s literalism appears in his illustration of the house made of &quot;twigges&quot; in &quot;The House of Fame&quot;, which looks like a large wicker basket, and in the horse of brass in &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tale&quot;. After setbacks and delays, including Morris&#x27;s own failing health, Morris changed the print run from 325 paper copies to 425. He sold them for 20 pounds each. 13 copies were printed on vellum and sold for 120 guineas each. The &quot;Chaucer&quot; was not profitable, and was subsidized by the profits from other books.

Morris designed the title, 14 large borders, 18 frames for illustrations, and 26 large initials specifically for the &quot;Chaucer&quot;. Printing began on 8 August 1894. Morris traced an issue with the paper staining yellow to his ink, and the issue disappeared after he received a softer version of the Hannover ink from the manufacturer. The stained pages were fixed by laying them in the sun. Most editions of the &quot;Chaucer&quot; had a plain paper board binding, but 48 had a pigskin binding, which cost 13 pounds extra, and was designed by Morris and performed by Doves Bindery.

Critical response to the Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot; was effulgent, with reviewers in 1896 calling it &quot;the finest book ever printed&quot; and the press&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement&quot;. A library catalog compared its importance to the history of printing to the Gutenberg Bible. Yeats called it &quot;the most beautiful of all printed books&quot;. An article on the Kelmscott Press in the &quot;Academy&quot; stated that it was &quot;a great landmark in the history of printing&quot;. According to Alan Crawford, a historian of the Arts and Crafts movement, it was &quot;like the Holy Grail tapestries: an intimate collaboration between Morris and Burne-Jones, their masterpiece in that particular medium, and their tribute to an early master of their imagination&quot;. A few criticisms have been expressed alongside the effusive praises of the &quot;Chaucer&quot;. Peter Faulkner, a William Morris expert, expressed his preference for &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by the Golden Cockerel Press, noting that in the Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot; &quot;the two sixty-three-line columns of 12-point type on the large page do not make for easy reading&quot;.

==Criticism==
Critics of the Kelmscott Press note that fine press books are a part of commodity culture that is only accessible to the rich, which contrasts with Morris&#x27;s socialist ideals. One of Morris&#x27;s supporters, UC Davis professor Elizabeth Carolyn Miller, argues that Kelmscott was an attempt to create a utopian print space and that Morris&#x27;s books were a criticism of mass print culture. Jeffrey Skoblow stated that Kelmscott books explored commodification as part of a Romantic-Marxist continuum.

Critics during Morris&#x27;s time wondered why he made expensive books that were inaccessible to most people when he was a socialist. Scholars have discussed the political implications of his work. According to Elizabeth Carolyn Miller, the Kelmscott Press and the idea of fine press books stand as a utopian criticism of mass print culture. Morris&#x27;s work aligns with the &quot;idealist&quot; aesthetic, which centers around the way the task of art uplifts humanity to approach an ideal. Aestheticism divorced this marriage of artistic ideals with ethical ones, postulating that artistic ideals are artificial. Many critics of Morris see his work as part of the commodity culture that supported Aestheticism. Miller argues that Morris was working toward an ideal of production that made print a utopian space for post-revolutionary art. Kelmscott itself, as a disruptive force in printing, is utopian in a way defined by Frederic Jameson—that a radical break from the status quo is &quot;reinforced by the Utopian form&quot;. Morris believed that the cultural impact of moveable type was not as considerable as people believed it was. Miller believes that the form of the Kelmscott books is utopian: the sharp lines of the wood-engraved illustrations &quot;insist on its material presence&quot; while the leafy borders common in Kelmscott books recall their place in nature while clearly delineating the artificiality of the image. The story of &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; described a utopia called &quot;Nowhere&quot;, where communal discussion occurred in verbal discourse, textual communication being the language of bureaucracy. Verbal discussion is preferred in the story that book-making is dying out. Kelmscott tried to separate readers from the present by immersing them in archaic and futuristic production values.

Thorstein Veblen, in his &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), called Kelmscott&#x27;s books a &quot;conspicuous waste&quot;, arguing that they were less convenient and more expensive than regular books, showing that the purchaser had time and money to waste. Linda Dowling and William Peterson saw Morris&#x27;s work at Kelmscott as being less political than his other work. Jeffrey Skoblow argued that the &quot;rigorously materialist impulse&quot; in the Kelmscott books was part of &quot;a great Romantic-Marxist continuum&quot; that explored commodification.

==Legacy==
After the closing of the Kelmscott Press, leftover paper and the type fonts were given to the Chiswick Press; however, the Kelmscott types were sold to Cambridge University Press in 1940 and later, made part of the Cambridge University Library. Ornaments and other woodblocks were deposited in to the British Museum. The presses and accompanying equipment were sold to C. R. Ashbee&#x27;s Essex House Press.
Ashbee imitated the Kelmscott Press in his press company, the Essex House Press. He used the same ink, paper, vellum, and presses that Kelmscott had used. He also commissioned wood engravings and created two of his own typefaces, named Endeavor and Kings Prayer Book. William S. Peterson, an English professor at the University of Maryland and a Morris scholar, called Ashbee&#x27;s typefaces &quot;ugly and eccentric&quot; but stated that the books themselves &quot;have a certain period charm&quot;. Their most important work was the Prayer Book of King Edward the Seventh. Pamela Todd, an art historian, describes their books as &quot;beautiful&quot; and achieve &quot;the same powerful effect as Morris&quot;. The Essex House Press printed 83 books, but was not able to compete with machine-press books in the Kelmscott style.

Cobden-Sanderson worked as a binder in the Doves Bindery, which carried out the pigskin bindings for the Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot;. Together with Emery Walker, Cobden-Sanderson founded Doves Press and used similar paper and vellum to Kelmscott. Cobden-Sanderson disliked the decorative style of the Kelmscott books; books from the Doves Press had only an occasional calligraphic initials. They created a font that copied fonts in Nicolas Jenson&#x27;s renaissance publications. Their 5-volume folio Bible remains an important landmark in the history of fine press, and their editions of Goethe inspired the formation of several fine presses in Germany. The most prominent of these were Bremer Press, Janus Presse, Kleukens Presse, Ernst Ludwig Presse, and Serpentis Presse.

The Vale Press, founded by Charles Ricketts with Charles Shannon, based their types on 15th-century calligraphy. They published literary classics, which allowed them to focus on the design and layout of the works. The Eragny Press shared type with Vale for a time and was famous for Lucien Pissarro&#x27;s illustrations. The Ashendene Press published many beautiful books over a period of 40 years. They published poetry books and folio versions of classic literature. Dun Emer Press was founded by Elizabeth and Lily Yeats in Dublin. These presses, that valued workers as craftsmen, reacted against the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s devaluing of human labour. Many of the fine press founders had socialist or anarchist opinions, and Kelmscott books were discussed in radical press.

Kelmscott also influenced fine presses in the United States. Kelmscott Press&#x27;s &quot;Hand and Soul&quot; inspired American printers, and the decorative style in &quot;The Altar Book&quot; (1896) by Daniel Berkeley Updike shows striking similarities to the Kelmscott &quot;Chaucer&quot;.

<doc id="1001254" wikidata="Q2023989" url="?curid=1001254" title="Fantasy trope">
<text>A fantasy trope is a specific type of literary trope (recurring theme) that occurs in fantasy fiction. Worldbuilding, plot, and characterization have many common conventions, many of them having ultimately originated in myth and folklore. J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium (and in particular, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;) for example, was inspired from a variety of different sources including Germanic, Finnish, Greek, Celtic and Slavic myths. Literary fantasy works operate using these tropes, while others use them in a revisionist manner, making the tropes over for various reasons such as for comic effect, and to create something fresh (a method that often generates new clichés).

==Good vs. Evil==
The conflict of good against evil is a theme in the many popular forms of fantasy; normally, evil characters invade and disrupt the good characters&#x27; lands. J. R. R. Tolkien delved into the nature of good and evil in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but many of those who followed him use the conflict as a plot device, and often do not distinguish the sides by their behavior. In some works, most notably in sword and sorcery, evil is not opposed by the unambiguously good but by the morally unreliable.

===Hero===

Heroic characters are a mainstay of fantasy, particularly high fantasy and sword and sorcery. Such characters are capable of more than ordinary behavior, physically, morally, or both. Sometimes they might have to grow into the role ordained for them. This may take the form of maturation, which is often through Coming of Age.

Many protagonists are, unknown to themselves, of royal blood. Even in so fanciful a tale as &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, Alice is made a queen in the end; this can serve as a symbolic recognition of the hero&#x27;s inner worth. Commonly, these tales revolve around the maltreated hero coming into his or her own. This can reflect a wish-fulfillment dream, or symbolically embody a profound transformation.

===Dark Lord===
The forces of evil are often personified in a &quot;Dark Lord&quot;. Besides possessing vast magical abilities, a Dark Lord often controls great armies and can be portrayed as possessing devil-like qualities. A Dark Lord is usually depicted as the ultimate personification of evil.

The villain of the &quot;Demon Sword&quot; video game is also literally called Dark Lord.

In the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; gamebooks, the Dark Lords are a race of powerful evil beings. The protagonists of the &quot;Overlord&quot; video game franchise are classic Dark Lords in the vein of Sauron. The Dark Lord is usually seen as unmarried, though there has been the occasion when one has attempted to claim a bride.

==Quest==

Quests, an immemorial trope in literature, are common in fantasy. They can be anything from a quest to locate the MacGuffins necessary to save the world, to an internal quest of self-realization.

==Magic==

In fantasy, magic often has an overwhelming presence, although its precise nature is delineated in the book in which it appears. It can appear in a fantasy world (as in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; or &quot;Shannara&quot;), or in a fantasy land that is part of reality but insulated from the mundane lands (as in Xanth), or as a hidden element in real life (as in The Dresden Files).

A common trope is that magical ability is innate and rare. As such, magic-wielding people are common figures in fantasy. Another feature is the magic item, which can endow characters with magical abilities or enhance the abilities of the innately powerful. Among the most common are magic swords and magic rings.

Self-fulfilling prophecies are amongst the most common forms of magic because they are an often used plot device. Often the effort undertaken to avert them brings them about, thus driving the story. It is very rare for a prophecy in a fantasy to be false, although usually, their significance is only clear with hindsight. Quibbles can undermine the clearest appearing prophecies.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, J. R. R. Tolkien minimized the use of the word &#x27;magic&#x27;; beings who use such abilities tend to be confused when they are described this way by others.

Science fantasy stories often make use of scientifically implausible powers similar to magic, such as psychics. However, unlike true science fiction works, these powers are used in a pulp manner with no examination of their effects on society, only to create more spectacular effects than science fiction alone can provide. An example of this is the use of the Force by the Jedi in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

==Medievalism==

Many fantasy creatures are inspired by European folklore and the romances of medieval Europe. Dragons and unicorns are among the most popular creatures. Other monsters, such as griffins, giants, and goblins also appear. Races of intelligent beings such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes often draw their history from medieval or pre-Christian roots. Characteristics of the hero and heroine also frequently draw on these sources as well.

This trope is also very important in the setting of many of these fantasies. Writers from the beginnings of the fantasy genre, such as William Morris in &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot; and Lord Dunsany in &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, set their tales in fantasy worlds clearly derived from medieval sources; though often filtered through later views. J. R. R. Tolkien set the type even more clearly for high fantasy, which is normally based in such a &quot;pseudo-medieval&quot; setting. Other fantasy writers have emulated him, and role-playing and computer games have also taken up this tradition.

The full width of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be feudalistic, corrupt empires despite the greater variety of the actual Middle Ages. Settings also tend to be medieval in economy, with many fantasy worlds disproportionately pastoral.

These settings are typical of epic fantasy and, to a lesser extent, of sword and sorcery — which contains more urban settings — than of fantasy in general; the preponderance of epic fantasy in the genre has made them fantasy commonplaces. They are less typical of contemporary fantasy, especially urban fantasy.

===Ancient world===
A less common inspiration is the ancient world. A famous example is the Hyborian Age (the fictional world of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;), which features analogues of Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Roman Empire, among others. Three notable recent series with such settings are: &quot;Bartimaeus&quot; by Jonathan Stroud, &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; and &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; by Rick Riordan.

==Races and species==

Many fantasy stories and worlds refer to their main sapient humanoid creatures as races, rather than species, in order to distinguish them from non-sapient creatures. J. R. R. Tolkien popularized the usage of the term in this context, in his legendarium (and particularly in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;), and the use of races in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing games further spread the label. Many fantasy and science fiction settings now use the terms race and species interchangeably, such as the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; computer game.

In role-playing games, &quot;race&quot; typically refers to any sapient species usable as a player character. Older editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; called the primary non-human player races (dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf, half-orc) &quot;demi-humans.&quot; Later games such as &quot;Shadowrun&quot; use the term &quot;metahuman,&quot; and define these humanoid races as subdivisions of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

<text>A is a district where geisha live and work in Japan. Each typically has its own name, crest, and distinct geisha population, with geisha not typically working outside of their own district. usually contain (geisha houses) and (teahouses where geisha entertain).

Historically, could contain a high number of and , and would also contain a as well – a communal meeting place for geisha, typically containing a theater, rooms where classes in the traditional arts could be held, and a (registry office) who would process a geisha&#x27;s pay, regulation of the profession, and other related matters.

Gion, a geisha district in Kyoto, also has a vocational school, called . Many of the teachers there are designated as Living National Treasures.
 were preceded by the registered red-light districts of Japan, known as . Three were established in Japan in the early 1600s: Shimabara in Kyoto in 1640, Shinmachi in Osaka between 1624 and 1644, and Yoshiwara in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) in 1617. were originally a place of work for both and (courtesans). , technically the highest rank of courtesan, also lived in the red-light districts; however, unlike , they did not engage in sex work, and were instead renowned as upper-class entertainers prized for their training in the traditional arts, which typically began at an early age. were only engaged by men of the upper classes, and could choose which clients they wished to engage, unlike other courtesans.

Following the development of the geisha profession in the in the mid-1700s, many geisha, working inside the alongside and courtesans, began to compete with them; though the entertainment they offered was mostly (and in official terms, entirely) devoid from sex work, geisha instead offered companionship and entertainment to men at parties, and were commonly not bound to the same controlling contracts that many courtesans were.

Having developed from a previously-male profession of entertainers who performed at the parties of some , geisha were at times legally prevented from operating outside of , despite also being legally prevented from appearing as, operating as and stealing clients from courtesans; as a result, many went on to develop into .

All three are now defunct, both as courtesan districts and geisha districts, though reenactors continue to practice the performing arts of upper-class courtesans in Shimabara, Kyoto, and some conventional sex work establishments continue to exist in Yoshiwara, Tokyo.

==Kyoto ==

There are currently five active in Kyoto, generally referred to as in the local Kyoto dialect instead of , and sometimes referred to collectively as the :
* Gion (separated as Gion Kōbu and Gion Higashi)
* Miyagawa-chō
* Kamishichiken
* Pontochō

As a for geisha, the district of Shimabara is defunct; having previously formed part of the city&#x27;s six districts (collectively referred to as the ), when Shimabara&#x27;s last geisha departed in the late 20th century, the district was considered defunct, despite the continuation of within the district.

The geisha districts of Kyoto are primarily clustered around the Kamo River, from Sanjō Street (3rd Street) to Gojō Street (5th Street), particularly around Shijō Street – four of the five districts are in this area. Kamishichiken is separated from the others, being far to the northwest, while the defunct district of Shimabara is also located to the west; most districts are roughly centered around their respective rehearsal halls, known as .

===Traditions===
Each district has a distinctive crest ( or ), which appears on geisha&#x27;s kimono, as well as on lanterns.

A summer tradition around the time of the Gion Festival among the of Kyoto is to distribute personalized to favored patrons and stores that both and geisha frequent. These feature a crest of the geisha house on the front, and the geisha&#x27;s name on the back (house name, then personal name). These are produced by , and are known as . Establishments such as bars that are particularly frequented by geisha often accumulate many of these fans, and typically display them in the summer months.

All the Kyoto stage public dances annually, known as (generally written in the traditional kana spelling of , rather than modern spelling of ), featuring both and geisha. These also feature an optional tea ceremony (tea and served by ) before the performance. These are performed for several weeks, mostly in the spring – four hold them in the spring with one (Gion Higashi) holding theirs in the autumn. Different districts started public performances in different years; the oldest are those of Gion Kōbu and Pontochō, whose performances started at the Kyoto exhibition of 1872, while others (Kamishichiken, Miyagawachō) started performing in the 1950s. There are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around 1500 yen to 4500 yen. The best-known is the performed in Gion Kōbu, which is one of the two oldest and has the most performances.

The dances are as follows (listed in order of performance through the year):
* – Kamishichiken (since 1953), spring, varying dates, currently last week of March and first week of April
* – Gion Kōbu (since 1872), all of April
* – Miyagawa-chō (since the 1950s), first 2 weeks of April
* – Pontochō (since 1872), most of May
* – Gion Higashi, early November

The district of Shimabara previously produced the from 1873 to 1880.

There is also a combined show of all five districts, which is called , or more formally . This takes place during the daytime on two days (Saturday and Sunday) on a weekend in late June (typically last or second-to-last weekend) at a large venue, and tickets are significantly more expensive than those for individual districts. Connected with this event, in the evening on these two days there are evening performances with meals, either a combined event, or separate ones per district. This is known as the , and is quite expensive (as is usual for and very limited availability; this has been held since 1994.

<text>Kavieng Airport is located in Kavieng, New Ireland, Papua New Guinea and is located approximately 1 km away from the town centre.

Originally constructed by Australian Commandos as a single runway, it was later taken and occupied by the Japanese on 23 Jan 1942, going on to expand and improve it. The airbase was regularly bombed by the Americans throughout 1943–44, the Japanese continued to actively use the airbase until 1944.

After the end of the war, it was converted to civilian use, and now possesses a modern, though small terminal facility.

On 17 Jun, 2016 an agreement was signed with the New Ireland Provincial Government to initiate the Kavieng Airport Project, intended to upgrade the site to an International Airport. To do this the existing runway will be extended 3.4m in width and 365.67m in length to meet international standards.

<doc id="1001282" wikidata="Q1967382" url="?curid=1001282" title="The Bluetones">
<text>The Bluetones are an English indie rock band, formed in Hounslow, Greater London, in 1993. The band&#x27;s members are Mark Morriss on vocals, Adam Devlin on guitar, Mark&#x27;s brother Scott Morriss on bass guitar, and Eds Chesters on drums. A fifth member, Richard Payne, came on board between 1998 and 2002. The band was originally named &quot;The Bottlegarden&quot;.

The band has scored thirteen top 40 singles and three top 10 albums on the UK charts. Although their commercial success waned in the post-Britpop era, they continued to tour and release new records. Their most recent album, &quot;A New Athens&quot; was released in May 2010.

==History==
After the release of two singles on Fierce Panda Records, the band signed to A&amp;M Records and released &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; on their own sublabel Superior Quality Recordings. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, and featured the singles &quot;Bluetonic&quot; and &quot;Slight Return&quot;, with the latter climbing to #2 on the UK charts. Following the touring and promotional duties for &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot;, the band released stand-alone single &quot;Marblehead Johnson&quot; to bridge the gap between albums.

The second Bluetones album, &quot;Return to the Last Chance Saloon&quot;, was released in 1998. While failing to repeat the commercial success of their debut, it reached the top 10 in the UK album charts and spawned the hit singles &quot;Solomon Bites the Worm&quot; and &quot;If...&quot;.

In 2000 the Bluetones released their third album, &quot;Science &amp; Nature&quot;, which again reached the Top 10 and featured the hit singles &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot; and &quot;Autophilia&quot;.

After a best-of album in 2002, the band released their fourth studio album &quot;Luxembourg&quot; to mixed reviews in 2003.

A three-album deal was signed in late 2005 with the Cooking Vinyl record label, promptly followed by the limited release of E.P. &quot;Serenity Now&quot; and a full UK tour.

In early 2006, Universal issued a comprehensive box set of all the Bluetones singles and B-sides released between 1995 and 2003, &quot;A Rough Outline&quot;.

A single, entitled &quot;My Neighbour&#x27;s House&quot;, was released in the UK on 18 September 2006. The single was taken from their self-titled album, which was released on 9 October that year. It failed to chart in the UK Albums Chart after its first week on sale. The album was also released in the United States, the first such occurrence since their debut. Although no reason was cited, on 1 October 2006, it was announced that a planned nine-date tour of North America and Australia had been scrapped. However, on 1 November 2006, the band began a month-long tour of Europe in support of their new release, including two sold-out nights at Glasgow&#x27;s King Tuts.

In February 2007, the band released &quot;BBC Radio Sessions&quot; containing tracks recorded for the BBC between 1994 and 2000. This was followed in June with their first full live album, &quot;Once Upon a Time in West Twelve&quot;, recorded at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 18 November 2005, and was followed on 29 October 2007, by a live DVD of the same concert under the title &quot;Beat about the Bush&quot;. 2007 also saw the release of a compilation album of early demo recordings, entitled &quot;The Early Garage Years&quot;. They also released a DVD under the title &quot;Blue Movies&quot;, which includes all of their 15 music videos.

In January 2008, the band began a mini-tour of Scotland, playing five cities (Stirling, Dunfermline, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh) in as many nights. In May 2008 a ten-date tour covered Cambridge, Whitehaven, Sheffield, Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, London, Bristol, Manchester and Darwen, including one of the last few concerts at the Astoria. They also played a gig with Dodgy on 17 May 2009, at a secret London venue, to benefit the homelessness charity Crisis, as part of the charity&#x27;s &#x27;Hidden Gigs&#x27; campaign against hidden homelessness.

In December 2008, the band embarked on a five-date tour, taking in Lincoln, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham. The tour saw them playing their debut album, &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot;, in full. Some further dates were subsequently announced for February and March 2009.

On 31 May 2010, the band released a new album entitled &quot;A New Athens&quot;. Despite moderate praise the album failed to chart in the UK Albums Chart.

On 28 March 2011, the band announced they would split after a farewell tour in the autumn. On 13 April 2015, the band announced that they would reform for a new UK tour.

In Summer 2017 they co-headlined the Star Shaped Festival tour run by the popular Britpop club of the same name alongside the newly reformed Sleeper. This took place in Birmingham, London, Manchester &amp; Glasgow in July and August 2017.

<doc id="1001285" wikidata="Q5606431" url="?curid=1001285" title="Greg Williams (Australian footballer)">
<text>Gregory Donald Williams (born 30 September 1963) is a former Australian rules footballer who represented , the Sydney Swans and in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the 1980s and 1990s. A midfielder, he is a dual Brownlow Medal winner and at his peak was the then-highest-paid player in the history of the sport, including an under-the-table $200,000 bonus payment. He was also linked to further controversy during the 1990s.

==Playing style==
Williams made his name as one of the best centres in the history of the game. He was particularly skilful at handpassing, and was the most prolific user of the skill during his era. The hallmark of Williams&#x27; play was his ability to win ground contests, and almost immediately free the ball to nearby teammates via quick, accurate handpassing. To that end, Williams&#x27; other strengths included his vision and awareness of the teammates around him; he is said to have been heavily involved in midfield tactics at ball-ups. His kicking and ball winning skills were also strong.

Williams strengths outweighed several negative physical characteristics which could have hindered his career as a footballer. Most notably, he was a slow runner; he had been knock-kneed as a child and his pace was not helped by five knee surgeries throughout his career. He was also short, stocky and carried extra weight early in his career.

Williams earned the nickname &quot;Diesel&quot;, after the nickname of John Riggins, an American NFL player whose motivational tapes were used by Williams&#x27; first Victorian Football League (VFL) Geelong captain Michael Turner, and remains widely used.

==Playing career==

===Before the VFL===
The third of eight children, Williams spent his early life in Melbourne, before moving to Bendigo at the age of 10. There, he played football for the Golden Square Football Club in the Bendigo Football League, earning strong acclaim at junior levels, representing Victoria in the Teal Cup in 1980.

Prior to the 1982 VFL season, Williams trained in the pre-season with the Carlton Football Club (to which the Bendigo Football League was zoned), but the Blues ultimately rejected him, deterred by his lack of speed and fitness. He returned to Golden Square for the season, winning the Michelsen Medal as league best and fairest. Carlton invited him to try out again in the 1983 pre-season, but again he was rejected. He returned to Golden Square, and once again he won the Michelsen Medal.

===Geelong===
As Carlton had passed on Williams, other VFL clubs were able to recruit him, and prior to the 1984 VFL season he was recruited to , then under coach Tom Hafey. Williams made his debut in Round 1 and amassed 38 disposals, and scored three Brownlow votes. He played twelve matches in his first season, missing much of the year with a knee injury. In his second season, he played every match, won the VFL Players Association MVP Award and the Carji Greeves Medal. He set new records for handpassing, with 399 handpasses for the season – a record which would stand until 2006 – and with 28 handpasses in the Round 22 match against Fitzroy – a record which would be tied several times, but not broken until 2008.

===Sydney Swans===
At the end of 1985, when Hafey took the job as coach of the Sydney Swans after being sacked by Geelong, Williams was promptly offered a sizeable contract to follow Hafey to Sydney. Williams was reported to have been offered roughly double the money he was on at Geelong. Williams accepted, and the deal was done with a transfer fee of $120,000 between the clubs, which was much less than the $200,000 that Geelong had sought.

Williams continued his strong form into his career with Sydney. In 1986, his first season there, Williams won the Brownlow Medal in a tie with &#x27;s Robert DiPierdomenico, and made the All-Australian team for the first time; he would back this up with his second All-Australian selection in 1987, and he placed third for the Brownlow in 1989. In Round 19, 1989, Williams amassed 53 disposals, which is the second highest ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match; it included another haul of 28 handpasses, and his career best tally of six goals.

===Transfer to Carlton===
During 1991, Williams decided that he wanted to return to Melbourne the following season, and and emerged as the two potential candidates. Since the introduction of the AFL Draft in 1986, Williams&#x27; move would need to take place as a trade, rather than with a transfer fee as had been the case under his first move. Ultimately, St Kilda was not willing to agree to Sydney&#x27;s requested trade, which would have included future dual-Brownlow Medallist Robert Harvey, and as a result Williams was traded to Carlton. In the end, a three-way trade involving Fitzroy was negotiated, with Simon Minton-Connell traded from Carlton to Sydney, Darren Kappler traded from Fitzroy to Sydney, Peter Sartori and Ashley Matthews traded from Carlton to Fitzroy, and Williams traded from Sydney to Carlton. Williams was estimated to be on a contract worth more than $300,000 per year (), which was then the highest contract in the history of the sport.

===Carlton===
After a solid 1992, Williams returned to career-best form for Carlton in 1993 and 1994. He finished second in the Brownlow Medal in 1993, one vote behind winner Gavin Wanganeen. In 1994, he polled 30 votes to win the award; he was the tenth player to win the Brownlow Medal twice, and the third to do so at different clubs. Additionally in 1994, he won the AFL Players Association MVP Award for the second time, becoming the first player to win the award twice; he won the Robert Reynolds Trophy as Carlton&#x27;s best and fairest for the only time in his career. He was also All-Australian in both 1993 and 1994 – the former as vice-captain, and the latter as captain. He won the first and only premiership of his VFL/AFL career with Carlton in 1995, and he won the Norm Smith Medal with five goals in the Grand Final. He was the first player to win a Brownlow Medal, Premiership Medallion, and Norm Smith Medal across his career.

Williams played two more seasons, before retiring at the end of a controversial 1997 season which saw a protracted legal battle between the AFL and Carlton over a suspension Williams received from the tribunal. He finished his career with 250 senior games: 34 with Geelong, 107 with Sydney, 109 with Carlton and 9 for Victoria in State of Origin matches. In his league career he accumulated 3600 handpasses; this was more than five hundred more than any other player before him, so prolific was his use of handpass, and it remained the record until 2006. As of the end of the 2016 season, his career average of 26.9 disposals per game remains the record for retired players, and his career average of 14.4 handpasses per game was the record until the retirement of Daniel Cross in 2015.

==Controversy==
Williams was a highly controversial figure during his career, and was involved in several scandals.

;Tribunal record
Williams frequently found himself in trouble with umpires and had many tribunal appearances – often as the result of overzealous retaliation against his taggers. He was charged a total of 19 times, found guilty 12 times, and suspended for a total of 34 matches during his career. He was also known for his generally impolite treatment of umpires, and the Tribunal found him guilty of verbally abusing an umpire on three occasions, for which he was twice fined and once suspended.

;Illegal player payments
In February 1992, it was uncovered that both Williams and the Sydney Swans had breached the league&#x27;s salary regulations. Williams had received additional, undeclared payments via one of Sydney&#x27;s sponsors during the 1990 season, with both the club and the player aware of the rort. Both plead guilty to the AFL. The club was fined $50,000, and Williams was fined $25,000 and de-registered by the league for eleven weeks. Williams was in his first pre-season with Carlton at the time, and his debut for the club was delayed until Round 7 as a result of the deregistration.

;1993 Brownlow Medal
When Williams finished one vote behind winner Gavin Wanganeen for the 1993 Brownlow Medal, it was noted that Williams had received no votes in Carlton&#x27;s nine goal victory against in Round 10 at Princes Park – a match in which Williams accumulated 44 disposals, kicked a goal and was generally thought to have been the most dominant player on the ground. The votes in that game attracted some media attention at the time, and Williams&#x27; poor relationship with umpires was often considered to have been a factor in his failure to poll votes. In 2006, one of the umpires in that match, Murray Bird, alleged this to be true, stating that he had wanted to award votes to Williams, but that his more senior colleague on the day, John Russo, had overruled him on the basis of Williams&#x27; negative attitude towards him. Russo denied the allegations. Williams briefly considered a legal challenge for the 1993 Brownlow Medal, but did not proceed.

;Racial vilification
In August 1995, Williams was charged with racially vilifying West Coast Eagles opponent Chris Lewis, after referring to him as a &quot;black c***&quot; during a match; he was one of the first players charged under an AFL rule, introduced in June 1995, which was specific to racial vilification. The case was settled with a public apology from Williams to Lewis; no penalty was imposed. It was not the only incident between the two players in their careers, with Lewis suspended for spitting at Williams in a match in 1993.

;Suspension appealed through the courts
Williams was involved in a particularly controversial tribunal case following an incident in Round 1 1997. After the final siren of Carlton&#x27;s match against Essendon, umpire Andrew Coates stepped in to break up a small conflict between Williams and Essendon&#x27;s Sean Denham. Williams pushed Coates in the chest to continue the exchange with Denham. The contact was not violent in nature, but was forceful enough to knock Coates off balance. Coates did not report Williams for the incident, but after viewing video footage, the AFL brought its own report against Williams to the tribunal. He was found guilty of &quot;undue interference with an umpire&quot; and suspended for nine matches.

Because the length of the suspension would have personally cost Williams $100,000 in match payments, Carlton decided to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court of Victoria; at the time, there was no Appeals Board at the AFL Tribunal, so the courts were the only place to appeal decisions. An injunction against the suspension was awarded on the Friday after the match, allowing Williams to continue playing until the case was heard (although he did have to serve a three-week suspension for a kneeing offence committed the very next week). Prior to Round 10, the court overturned the nine-week suspension, with Justice John Hedigan making direct recommendation that the AFL Tribunal establish its own appeals process as part of his judgement. The AFL then appealed Hedigan&#x27;s decision in the Victorian Court of Appeal, and the three justices found in the AFL&#x27;s favour (by a majority of 2–1), and re-instated Williams&#x27; nine-week suspension, to be served starting in Round 17. Carlton attempted to take the case to the High Court of Australia, but the High Court rejected the application. Altogether, Carlton suffered more than $400,000 in legal costs. Williams served six matches of the suspension before retiring at the end of the season. The AFL did act on Hedigan&#x27;s recommendation, and established an Appeals Board for the 1998 season.

==Personal life==
Williams has a son, Jake, who trained with Carlton in the 2007 pre-season, but was ultimately not drafted to the AFL. Jake was eligible to be selected by either Carlton or Sydney under the father–son rule.

==Health==
In February 2013 it was reported that Williams was among a group of seven former AFL and NRL players who were tested by researchers at Deakin University and found to have symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative condition which has affected some athletes who have had a history of severe concussions and other head traumas. It was reported that Williams was suffering memory loss, including that he no longer recalls many specific details about some of his greatest football achievements, such as Carlton&#x27;s 1995 premiership game.

<text>Jan Nieuwenhuys (8 January 1922 – 28 December 1986) was a Dutch painter and one of the early active founders of the Dutch Experimentalists group (Reflex) that later became part of CoBrA.

==Life and work==
Nieuwenhuys was born in Amsterdam.

Around the age of 14, Nieuwenhuys and his two-year older brother decided to become painters. From 1938 to 1941 he attended the Rijksnormaalschool in Amsterdam. Later in the Second World War he also took lessons at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam. At the Rijksacademie he met Karel Appel and Corneille.

During World War II Nieuwenhuys painted almost only clowns, nudes and couples making love. Just after the war he started painting fantasy animals like aggressive cocks, cats and bulls. He and his brother Constant had many arguments about his paintings. During the war Constant himself painted only Catholic scenes like &quot;Pietà&quot; and Maria portraits or still lifes and thought that Nieuwenhuys chose his subjects too lightly.

In 1948 Appel, Elburg, Kouwenaar, Wolvekamp, Corneille, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Brands, Rooskens and Nieuwenhuys founded the &quot;Experimentele Groep in Holland&quot; that a few months later became the European group CoBrA. Jan was in his paintings of this period influenced by dreams, children&#x27;s drawings, the artistic expressions of mentally handicapped people and primitive art. Animals such as birds and cats play a leading role in most of his works, along with fantastic creatures and beings that are made up of a combination of human, animal and mechanical elements. A lot of the creatures balance on a rope or wear boats as a hat.

Nieuwenhuys was soon disappointed in the members of the CoBrA group, some of them were more interested in fame than being an activist. He could not stand the fighting that was going on between the members and so he left the group in the middle of 1949. Some other members also left, but they later rejoined for the great exhibition in the Stedelijk Museum.

In 1964 he said in an interview: &quot;The group was not founded as an exposition group but as a group of activists. We wanted to put an effort into that, to fight against the softness in art at the time and using our imagination to change that. Regrettably I must ascertain that many of the Experimentalists of that day also became esthetics. Everything official stops to be combatant. I think that work of some of them look very dormant these days&quot;.

Nieuwenhuys later concentrated only on his work. His paintings became more and more liberated and he experimented with different materials like fluorescent paint and everything he could get his hands on. Everything could become a painting.

In an interview from 1964 he said: &quot;I start with my material and my color. With that I express myself. From the material I come to my subject and that is maybe contrary to what painters did in earlier days. I paint the way I write, the way I laugh. That is why I paint differently all the time, because my moods change. That’s the way I feel.&quot;

&quot;As a painter I don’t want to paint a particular situation. I am not abstract, not really non-figurative. I try to be expressive and therefore I need certain images. Today I am in China, tomorrow in Paris, after tomorrow some other place. We are confronted every day with what happens in the world. You’re living on a specific spot, but also in the whole world. It’s maybe therefore that we become so ignorant and hard, because we experience too much. Hunger, war. That particular situation doesn’t mean anything anymore.&quot;

From the same interview: &quot;I wish, if they see my work later on, that they can see the twentieth century. The artist must give his time a suit. And it doesn’t matter if he is an architect, poet or painter. In abstract painting I miss the beat of this time, the rudeness. We, the people of today we are living with the fear of an atom bomb. The abstracts are building only a superficial world for you.&quot;

He died in Amsterdam in 1986.

<text>In mathematics, the concept of irreducibility is used in several ways.

* A polynomial over a field may be an irreducible polynomial if it cannot be factored over that field.
* In abstract algebra, irreducible can be an abbreviation for irreducible element of an integral domain; for example an irreducible polynomial.
* In representation theory, an irreducible representation is a nontrivial representation with no nontrivial proper subrepresentations. Similarly, an irreducible module is another name for a simple module.
* Absolutely irreducible is a term applied to mean irreducible, even after any finite extension of the field of coefficients. It applies in various situations, for example to irreducibility of a linear representation, or of an algebraic variety; where it means just the same as &quot;irreducible over an algebraic closure&quot;.
* In commutative algebra, a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is irreducible if its prime spectrum, that is, the topological space Spec &quot;R&quot;, is an irreducible topological space.
* A matrix is irreducible if it is not similar via a permutation to a block upper triangular matrix (that has more than one block of positive size). (Replacing non-zero entries in the matrix by one, and viewing the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a directed graph, the matrix is irreducible if and only if such directed graph is strongly connected.) A detailed definition is given here.
* Also, a Markov chain is irreducible if there is a non-zero probability of transitioning (even if in more than one step) from any state to any other state.
* In the theory of manifolds, an &quot;n&quot;-manifold is irreducible if any embedded (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-sphere bounds an embedded &quot;n&quot;-ball. Implicit in this definition is the use of a suitable category, such as the category of differentiable manifolds or the category of piecewise-linear manifolds. The notions of irreducibility in algebra and manifold theory are related. An &quot;n&quot;-manifold is called prime, if it cannot be written as a connected sum of two &quot;n&quot;-manifolds (neither of which is an &quot;n&quot;-sphere). An irreducible manifold is thus prime, although the converse does not hold. From an algebraist&#x27;s perspective, prime manifolds should be called &quot;irreducible&quot;; however, the topologist (in particular the 3-manifold topologist) finds the definition above more useful. The only compact, connected 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible are the trivial 2-sphere bundle over &quot;S&quot;1 and the twisted 2-sphere bundle over &quot;S&quot;1. See, for example, Prime decomposition (3-manifold).
* A topological space is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper closed subsets. This notion is used in algebraic geometry, where spaces are equipped with the Zariski topology; it is not of much significance for Hausdorff spaces. See also irreducible component, algebraic variety.
* In universal algebra, irreducible can refer to the inability to represent an algebraic structure as a composition of simpler structures using a product construction; for example subdirectly irreducible.
* A 3-manifold is P²-irreducible if it is irreducible and contains no 2-sided formula_1 (real projective plane).
* An irreducible fraction (or fraction in lowest terms) is a vulgar fraction in which the numerator and denominator are smaller than those in any other equivalent fraction.</text><links>

<doc id="1001297" wikidata="Q4885904" url="?curid=1001297" title="Ben Iden Payne">
<text>Ben Iden Payne (5 September 1881 – 6 April 1976), also known as B. Iden Payne, was an English actor, director and teacher. Active in professional theatre for seventy years, he helped the first modern repertory theatre in the United Kingdom, was an early and effective advocate for Elizabethan staging of Shakespeare plays, and served as an inspiration for Shakespeare Companies and university theatre programmes throughout North America and the British Isles. A theatre at the University of Texas is named after him, as well as annual theatre awards presented in Austin, Texas.

==Early life==
Born on 5 September 1881, in Newcastle upon Tyne, he was raised and educated in Manchester. He was the youngest of four children. His father, a Unitarian minister, died at age 52, when Payne was eleven years old. As a young child, the first Shakespeare play he saw was a touring production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. During his second year at the Manchester Grammar School he appeared in his first Shakespearean role, Bassanio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

==Modified Elizabethan staging theory==
Payne called his method &quot;modified Elizabethan staging&quot;. It was inspired by the founder of the Elizabethan Stage Society, William Poel, and developed during Payne&#x27;s time in Pittsburgh. He drew on actual stages from the Elizabethan period. An audience member, said Payne, should feel that &quot;he was sharing in the action—not looking at something outside himself&quot;. This could be achieved by creating a more intimate space, where the audience was not separated from the actors by &quot;the proscenium arch, footlights, or orchestra pits&quot;. Additionally, audience members were, according to this method, better able to focus in on the actors and the play itself when they were not distracted by &quot;falling curtains, blackouts, planned pauses for resetting scenery … or any other forced interruption&quot; of the action of the play.

==First professional work==
While still in school, he started his career as a walk-on actor in 1899. Upon being interviewed by Frank Benson, he was introduced to Mrs Benson; he was astonished to see she was the actress who played Viola in the traveling production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; he had seen as a child. After a four-week trial engagement with Benson, Payne spent a season touring Britain with a much smaller company. He returned to Benson the next year, but this engagement was cut short when a fire at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne destroyed the company&#x27;s stock of scenery and costumes. Payne signed on with the touring troupe of Carlyon and Charlton, a &quot;fit-up&quot; company that travelled with their own stage proscenium, stage curtains, lighting and scenery. In 1902 he returned to Benson, where he worked both as an actor and an assistant stage manager, his first non-acting theatrical experience. He toured with Benson and several other companies the next several years, performing Shakespeare in Jamaica with the Benson Company, participating in the first production (staged by the Arthur Hare Company) of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; performed after the trial and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde. During that period, he married the actress Mona Limerick; they had three children.
==Stage director at the Abbey Theatre==
As the tour with McIntosh petered out, Payne auditioned for director and producer Harley Granville-Barker. Granville-Barker referred him to Cyril Keightley, who took him on tour to Ireland. Shortly thereafter, and unexpectedly, Payne was approached by William Butler Yeats, one of the Directors of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Unknown to Payne, Granville-Barker had recommended him for the position; equally unknown to him at the time, the English financial patron of the Abbey, Annie Horniman, insisted on an English professional stage manager as a condition for a three-year subsidy she was making to the theatre.

Payne met Yeats and the other two directors of the Abbey, Lady Gregory and J. M. Synge, for an interview the weekend that Synge&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, opened. Payne was in the first row of the audience when the famous &quot;Playboy&quot; riots broke out in the house, with audience members breaking out in a pandemonium of shouting during the second half, over the alleged scandalous content of the play.

Payne was engaged as stage director of the Abbey Theatre, but with strict instructions that he was not to participate in the production of Irish folk plays. Payne was not aware at the time that his employment was made at the insistence of Horniman, nor that Lady Gregory and Synge were opposed to bringing in a British play director to the Irish National Theatre. The engagement lasted only a few months; after taking the company on a British tour from Glasgow, Scotland, to London, Payne resigned his position. He maintained a friendship with Yeats.

==Manchester Repertory Company==
The day after resigning his position with the Abbey, he received a note from Horniman, the Abbey patron. She was unhappy with her relationship with the Irish National Theatre (the unhappiness was mutual) and she wanted to sponsor a new theatrical venture, under Payne&#x27;s direction. Payne proposed establishing a repertory company in Manchester, a major provincial city in England and Payne&#x27;s boyhood home. With Horniman&#x27;s funding he established the Manchester Repertory Company, the first true repertory company in theatre in England. He directed many of the early plays of Bernard Shaw and John Galsworthy.

In 1907, Payne used William Poel to direct &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, by William Shakespeare, with the Manchester Repertory Company. Poel was an early-twentieth-century innovative advocate of producing Shakespeare plays as written, without the heavy scenery and butchered text of grand nineteenth-century productions by the likes of Henry Irving. Poel&#x27;s production at Manchester Repertory may have been his best, as Payne had cast it with talented, professional actors, and not the amateurs Poel usually worked with.

The next year, Payne produced Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; as a Christmas play at Manchester. To keep the pace of the play flowing, without long interruptions during scene changes, he staged played connecting scenes in front of a neutral curtain drawn across the proscenium. This was an early experiment in staging Shakespeare plays as continuous action, as was the style at the Globe Theatre when the plays were first written and produced. Payne resigned as director of Manchester Repertory in 1911, both for personal reasons (his wife, Mona Limerick, did not get along with Horniman) and because he believed new management could produce more popular plays that might stem the red ink of the operation.

== Going to America ==
In 1913 Payne was invited to the United States to organise a season of modern plays for the Chicago Theatre Society, a pioneering community theatre. He had been referred to that company by Horniman. The Society produced a repertory season of plays by Shaw and Galsworthy, as well as a conventionally staged production of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. In February 1914, he produced a series of plays in Indianapolis for the Drama League of America. The next year he directed a little theatre company in Philadelphia.

==Carnegie Tech==
While in Chicago, Kenneth Sawyer Goodman, the namesake of the Goodman Theatre, introduced Payne to Thomas Wood Stevens Arthur Hamerschlag. Hamerschlag was the first President of Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and Stevens was the first chairman of the department of drama there, the first professional drama department in a university. Payne directed &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, by Shaw during the department&#x27;s first year of operation. Payne was associated with the school of drama at Carnegie Tech from 1914, and two years later he first directed the annual Shakespeare play, to 1950, excepting the Stratford years of 1935–1943. While at Carnegie Tech he tried out Poel&#x27;s concept of Shakespeare productions performed on English Renaissance theatre stages, without elaborate scenery, by staging an annual Elizabethan production there. At Carnegie they had first used elaborate scenery for Shakespeare plays, but Payne discovered that the more they simplified the scenery the better it was for the production and the more immediate was the appeal to the audience.

In 1925 Stevens departed Carnegie to manage the newly created Goodman Theatre in Chicago, and Payne succeeded him as chairman of the drama department. During his first year in the chair in 1925, he directed a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; fully using the staging technique he came to describe as &quot;modified Elizabethan staging&quot;. He left the chair of the Department in 1928, but returned every year until 1951 (except for the years at Stratford), directing 58 plays at Carnegie between 1914 and 1951, 26 of them by Shakespeare.

==Broadway career==
In 1915, Payne produced the first staging of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; by Harold Brighouse for The Shubert Organization. In 1916 he directed John Barrymore in his first success in a serious role, in the American premiere of &quot;Justice&quot; by John Galsworthy. According to Angus L. Bowmer, founder of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a financial backer demanded that Barrymore be replaced, fearing a disastrous drinking binge. Payne replied, in effect, that if they replaced Barrymore they would have to find a new director. Barrymore stayed and the performance launched his career. &quot;Justice&quot; had been produced by John D. Williams, press agent for Charles Frohman. In 1917, Payne accepted a position as a stage director of the Charles Frohman Company, a leading American producing organisation.

Payne would split his time between directing professionally in New York and directing students at the school of drama at Carnegie Tech, sometimes preferring the attitude and commitment of his &quot;apprentice actors&quot; in Pittsburgh to his professional actors on Broadway. Payne was unhappy with the work at Frohman, with its emphasis on type casting, and a star system where engaging a celebrity actor (who cared more about their own performance than the good of the play as a whole) was the main concern, and he left in 1923. He returned to Broadway in 1943 to direct several plays for the Theatre Guild of New York.

==Inspiration on other theatres==
As a guest director at the University of Washington in the summer of 1930 he staged Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; on an Elizabethan style, on a temporary thrust stage. The productions inspired a young graduate student, Angus L. Bowmer, who acted in and staged managed the productions. Bowmer went on to incorporate these staging concepts when he founded the Oregon Shakespeare Festival five years later. Payne directed Shakespeare&#x27;s Cymbeline at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1956, and A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream in 1961.

In 1934 Payne and Thomas Woods Stevens edited and produced several short (one hour) productions of Shakespeare plays that were presented during the second year of the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (Century of Progress) at a crude reconstruction of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre. This recreation of the Globe, and these short Shakespeare plays, inspired the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition to build a recreation of the Globe there as well, designed by Stevens, and stage their short 50 minute Shakespeare plays The exhibition was such a success that the recreated Globe in San Diego was preserved following the exposition, and became the home of the Old Globe Theatre. Payne returned to the Old Globe in San Diego in 1949 to direct its first Summer Shakespeare Festival, a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 1949, and directed there several summers until 1964.

==Stratford Festival==
Payne returned to England from 1935 to 1943 to direct the Stratford Memorial Theatre Festival in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Having experimented with quasi-Elizabethan at Carnegie Tech, he was forced by the tradition of the organisation&#x27;s management and the restrictions of the huge old Memorial Theatre to use traditional proscenium techniques. The experience was unhappy for Payne, and he departed in 1943. He directed no fewer than thirty seven productions at Stratford.

==Later academic career and the University of Texas==
Payne produced Shakespeare plays as a guest professor at the University of Washington in 1943 and 1946, the University of Iowa in 1943, the University of Missouri in 1948, the University of Colorado in 1953, the University of Michigan in 1954, San Diego State University 1949–52, Allan Hancock College, California in 1968, and the Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta, Canada 1959–1963. Payne went to the University of Texas at Austin in 1946 and spent the rest of his career as an academic there. He served as Chairman of the Department of Drama 1947–1947 and again 1951–52. He directed 29 plays at Texas, 24 by Shakespeare, and retired as Professor Emeritus of Drama in May 1973. He directed his last production at Texas in 1968, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The B. Iden Payne Awards, awarded to actors, directors, and designers for outstanding contributions to theatre in Austin, Texas, are named in his honour. In 1976, one of the three theatres on campus (now seven theatres) at the University of Texas in Austin was named after him.

<doc id="1001315" wikidata="Q689740" url="?curid=1001315" title="HMS Venerable (1899)">
<text>HMS Venerable (1899) was a member of the of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy. The &quot;London&quot;s were near repeats of the preceding s, but with modified armour protection. &quot;Venerable&quot;″s main battery consisted of four 12-inch (305-mm) guns, and she had top speed of . The ship was laid down in January 1899, was launched in November that year, and was completed in November 1902. Commissioned that month, &quot;Venerable&quot; served in the Mediterranean Fleet until 1908, and was subsequently recommissioned into the Channel Fleet. Following a major refit in 1909, she served with the Atlantic and Home Fleets.

After the outbreak of World War I, she took part in defensive and offensive operations with the Channel Fleet, shelling German positions in Belgium through May 1915. Thereafter transferred to the Mediterranean, she saw service in the Dardanelles campaign in mid-1915, and then in the Adriatic through 1916. That December, she returned to England and was refitted as a depot ship in 1918. She was sold for scrap in 1921 and was ultimately broken up in 1922.

==Design==

The five ships of the &quot;London&quot; class were ordered in 1898 in response to increased naval construction for the Russian Navy. The design for the &quot;London&quot; class was prepared in 1898; it was a virtual repeat of the preceding , though with significant revision to the forward armour protection scheme. Rather than a traditional transverse bulkhead for the forward end of the main belt armour, the belt was carried further forward and gradually tapered in thickness. Deck armour was also strengthened.

&quot;Venerable&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 714 officers and enlisted men. The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from .

&quot;Venerable&quot; had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to sixteen 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. The tubes were placed on the broadside, abreast of the main battery barbettes.

&quot;Venerable&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==

===Pre-First World War===
HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 2 January 1899, launched on 2 November 1899, and completed in November 1902. After many delays due to difficulties with her machinery contractors, HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; commissioned on 12 November 1902 by Captain George Edwin Patey for service as Second Flagship, Rear Admiral, Mediterranean Fleet. She left Chatham on 20 November, called at Sheerness to adjust compasses, and arrived at the Mediterranean the following month. In 1903, she had an experimental fire control system for evaluation. During her Mediterranean service, she ran aground outside Algiers harbor, suffering slight hull damage, and underwent a refit at Malta in 1906–1907. On 12 August 1907 she was relieved as flagship by battleship HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, and her Mediterranean service ended on 6 January 1908, when she paid off at Chatham Dockyard.

&quot;Venerable&quot; recommissioned on 7 January 1908 for Channel Fleet service. She paid off at Chatham for an extensive refit in February 1909, during which her 3-pounder guns were removed and a rangefinder was installed on her foremast. The refit complete, &quot;Venerable&quot; recommissioned on 19 October 1909 for service in the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 May 1912 she transferred to the Second Home Fleet at the Nore, and went into the commissioned reserve with a nucleus crew as part of the 5th Battle Squadron. In 1913, her anti-torpedo nets were removed and a pair of searchlights were installed on her forward bridge.

===First World War===
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet, based at Portland. Returning to full commission, &quot;Venerable&quot; patrolled the English Channel, and on 25 August 1914 covered the movement of the Portsmouth Marine Battalion to Ostend, Belgium, In October 1914, &quot;Venerable&quot; was attached to the Dover Patrol for bombardment duties in support of Allied troops fighting on the front. She bombarded German positions along the Belgian coast between Westende and Lombardsijde from 26 to 30 October 1914 during a German attack on Belgian defences in the Battle of the Yser; she also served as the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Dover Patrol, Rear Admiral Sir Horace Hood, from 27 to 29 October. On the 27th, German field guns were moved up close to shore, which forced most of the light vessels to retreat, though the heavily armoured &quot;Venerable&quot; remained on station until reports of a German U-boat in the area prompted Hood to withdraw to Dunkirk. &quot;Venerable&quot; was back on station on 28 October, along with the gunboat and three monitors, to blunt another German attack. Later that day, she ran lightly aground on an uncharted sandbank, but was at that time out of range of German guns and was able to free herself with help from at high tide. By the end of the month, the flooding from the opened sluices around Nieuwpoort had blocked the German advance, diverting German attacks further inland, out of range of &quot;Venerable&quot;″s guns. The German guns along the coast had by this time been hidden, which made it far more difficult to engage them with naval gunfire, so &quot;Venerable&quot; was recalled.

On 3 November, she was detached to support East Coast Patrols during the German raid on Yarmouth, though she did not see action with German warships. The 5th Battle Squadron transferred from Portland to Sheerness on 14 November 1914 to guard against a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom. The squadron returned to Portland on 30 December 1914. &quot;Venerable&quot;, in company with the tender &quot;Excellent&quot; and escorting destroyers and minesweepers, again bombarded German positions near Westende on 11 March 1915. The bombardment was meant to divert German attention during the British attack at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. She returned again on 10 May in an attempt to suppress German artillery that had been shelling Dunkirk, but German counter-battery fire prevented &quot;Venerable&quot; from dropping anchor or achieving any success.

On 12 May 1915, &quot;Venerable&quot; was ordered to the Dardanelles to replace the battleship in the Dardanelles Campaign. She steamed to the Mediterranean with the battleship ; the British hoped to take advantage of the experience both ships&#x27; crews had gained in bombarding coastal positions in Belgium. From 14 August 1915 to 21 August 1915, she supported Allied attacks on Ottoman positions at Suvla Bay. By the 21st, weather conditions worsened significantly, preventing the ships from being able to observe targets. In October, &quot;Venerable&quot; arrived at Gibraltar for a refit. Emerging from the refit in December 1915, she transferred to the Adriatic Sea to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy, serving there until December 1916.

&quot;Venerable&quot; then returned to the United Kingdom, arriving at Portsmouth Dockyard on 19 December 1916, where she was laid up. In February and March 1918 she was refitted there as a depot ship, and she moved to Portland on 27 March 1918 to serve as a depot ship for minelaying trawlers. She was attached to the Northern Patrol through August 1918, then to the Southern Patrol from September to December 1918. &quot;Venerable&quot; paid off into care and maintenance at Portland at the end of December 1918. She was placed on the disposal list there in May 1919 and on the sale list on 4 February 1920. She was sold to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company for scrapping on 4 June 1920, resold to Slough Trading Company in 1922, then resold again to a German firm in the middle of 1922. She was towed to Germany to be broken up.

<text>Virginia Mayo (born Virginia Clara Jones; November 30, 1920 – January 17, 2005) was an American actress and dancer. She was in a series of popular comedy films with Danny Kaye and was Warner Bros.&#x27; biggest box-office draw in the late 1940s. She also co-starred in the 1946 Oscar-winning movie &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mayo was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of newspaper reporter Luke and his wife, Martha Henrietta (née Rautenstrauch) Jones. Her family had roots back to the earliest days of St Louis, including great-great-great grandfather Captain James Piggott, who founded East St. Louis, Illinois, in 1797. Young Virginia&#x27;s aunt operated an acting school in the St. Louis area, which Virginia began attending at age six. She also had a series of dancing instructors engaged by her aunt.

===Vaudeville===
Following her graduation from Soldan High School at age 16 in 1937, she landed her first professional acting and dancing jobs at the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre (more commonly known as The Muny) and in an act with six other girls at the Hotel Jefferson. Performer Andy Mayo, impressed with her ability, recruited her to appear in his act, &quot;Morton and Mayo&quot;.

She toured the American vaudeville circuit for three years, serving as ringmaster and comedic foil for &quot;Pansy the Horse,&quot; as Andy Mayo and his partner, Nonnie Morton, performed in a horse suit. They appeared together in some short films and were a huge hit at Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in the Broadway theater district, where she was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn.

===Broadway===
In 1941, now officially known by her stage name Virginia Mayo, she got another career break as she appeared on Broadway with Eddie Cantor in &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot;.

===Sam Goldwyn===

In the early 1940s, Virginia Mayo&#x27;s talent and striking beauty came to the attention of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, who signed her to an acting contract with his company. 

Goldwyn only made a few films a year and usually loaned out the actors he had under contract to other producers. Her first notable role was in &quot;Jack London&quot; (1943), which starred her future husband Michael O&#x27;Shea for producer Samuel Bronston.

Mayo was placed in the chorus of the film &quot;Up in Arms&quot; just so she could learn, but she was never officially a member of the Goldwyn Girls. Then RKO borrowed her for a support role in a musical, &quot;Seven Days Ashore&quot; (1944).

===Stardom===

Mayo&#x27;s first starring role came in 1944 opposite comedian Bob Hope in &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot; (1944), a spoof of pirate movies made by Goldwyn. It earned over $3 million at the box office. Goldwyn then made her Danny Kaye&#x27;s leading lady for the musicals &quot;Wonder Man&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Kid from Brooklyn&quot; (1946), both very popular.

Going against the previous stereotype, Mayo accepted the supporting role of unsympathetic gold-digger Marie Derry in William Wyler&#x27;s drama &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946) for Goldwyn. Her performance drew favorable reviews from critics. The film also became the highest-grossing film in the US since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. At the zenith of her career, Mayo was seen as the quintessential voluptuous Hollywood beauty. It was said that she &quot;looked like a pinup painting come to life.&quot; In a film review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote of Mayo, &quot;As a comedy actress, [she] is no better than a rather weak script. But as a model for bathing apparel—well, do you or do you not like bathing suits?&quot; According to widely published reports from the late 1940s, the Sultan of Morocco declared her beauty to be &quot;tangible proof of the existence of God.&quot;

Eagle-Lion Films borrowed her to play the lead in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1947), a comedy with George Brent.

Mayo was reunited with Kaye in &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947), another big success, and &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; (1948), a box office disappointment. In between, Warners borrowed her for the lead in a film noir, &quot;Smart Girls Don&#x27;t Talk&quot; (1948).

===Warner Bros===

Warner Bros ended up taking over her contract from Goldwyn. They starred her in another film noir, &quot;Flaxy Martin&quot; (1949) with Zachary Scott, then she did a Western with Joel McCrea and director Raoul Walsh, &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; (1949), and a comedy with Ronald Reagan, &quot;The Girl from Jones Beach&quot; (1949).

Mayo received excellent reviews in another unsympathetic role, playing James Cagney&#x27;s sultry and scheming wife in the gangster classic &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949), also for Walsh. Mayo admitted she was frightened by Cagney as the psychotic gunman in &quot;White Heat&quot; because he was so realistic.

Roy Del Ruth borrowed her to play opposite George Raft in &quot;Red Light&quot; (1949) and she was Milton Berle&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Always Leave Them Laughing&quot; (1949).

Mayo was top billed in the film noir &quot;Backfire&quot; (1950), and she was a huge hit in &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot; (1950) as Burt Lancaster&#x27;s love interest.

She co-starred again with James Cagney and a young Doris Day in &quot;The West Point Story&quot; (1950), singing and dancing with Cagney, and was Gregory Peck&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.&quot; (1951), Warners most popular film of the year. She co-starred with Kirk Douglas in a Western for Walsh, &quot;Along the Great Divide&quot; (1951).

Mayo starred opposite Dennis Morgan in David Butler&#x27;s Technicolor musical, &quot;Painting the Clouds with Sunshine&quot; (1951) which was a moderate success. While Mayo appeared in several musicals, using her dance training, her voice was always dubbed.

Mayo appeared in the all-star cast of &quot;Starlift&quot; (1951) and was top billed in &quot;She&#x27;s Working Her Way Through College&quot; (1952) with Reagan. She was Alan Ladd&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;The Iron Mistress&quot; (1952), a popular biopic of Jim Bowie, and starred in another musical, &quot;She&#x27;s Back on Broadway&quot; (1953).

Mayo appeared in the comedy-drama-action film &quot;South Sea Woman&quot; (1953) with Burt Lancaster and Chuck Connors. RKO borrowed her for a Western in 3-D, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Canyon&quot; (1953), and she co-starred with Rex Harrison and George Sanders in &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot; (1954).

She was top billed in &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954) opposite Pier Angeli and Paul Newman in his film debut. The film was a notorious flop.

===Post-Warners===

Benedict Bogeaus gave her the lead in &quot;Pearl of the South Pacific&quot; (1955). Edmund Grainger cast her in &quot;Great Day in the Morning&quot; (1956), with Robert Stack, directed by Jacques Tourneur.

Mayo went to 20th Century Fox to play Robert Ryan&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;The Proud Ones&quot; (1956) then she did &quot;Congo Crossing&quot; (1956) at Universal.

Mayo was reunited with Ladd in &quot;The Big Land&quot; (1957) made back at Warners. She played Cleopatra in the 1957 fantasy film &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot;. 

Mayo made &quot;The Tall Stranger&quot; (1957) with McCrea for Allied Artists, &quot;Fort Dobbs&quot; (1958) with Clint Walker at Warners and &quot;Westbound&quot; (1959) with Randolph Scott at Warners. Her last film of the decade was 1959&#x27;s &quot;Jet Over the Atlantic&quot;. She began guest starring on television shows such as &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, and &quot;Lux Playhouse&quot;.

===1960s===
Mayo and her husband made a pilot for a TV series &quot;McGarry and His Mouse&quot; (1960), which was not picked up. She went to Italy to make &quot;Revolt of the Mercenaries&quot; (1961).

Mayo&#x27;s film career tapered off considerably. She appeared in &quot;Young Fury&quot; (1965) with Rory Calhoun, &quot;Castle of Evil&quot; (1966), and &quot;Fort Utah&quot; (1967) with John Ireland. She also guest starred on shows such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Daktari&quot; and appeared onstage in such plays as &quot;That Certain Girl&quot; (1967) and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1968) with Lyle Talbot. 

===Later career===
Mayo acted on stage for the rest of her career, mostly in dinner theatre and touring shows. Productions included &quot;No, No Nanette&quot; (1972), &quot;40 Carats&quot; (1975), &quot;Good News&quot; (1977), &quot;Move Over Mrs Markham&quot; (1980) and &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; (1981).

Mayo continued to occasionally appear on television in shows such as &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and a dozen episodes of the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

Mayo was one of many famous actors to make a cameo appearance in the all-star box office bomb &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976). She had roles in &quot;Lanigan&#x27;s Rabbi&quot; (1977), &quot;Haunted&quot; (1977), and &quot;French Quarter&quot; (1978). Later film appearances were in &quot;Evil Spirits&quot; (1990), &quot;Midnight Witness&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Man Next Door&quot; (1997), which was her last film role.

Mayo was one of the first to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hers is located at 1751 Vine Street. In 1996, she was honored by her hometown as she received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 1993, Mayo published a Christmas themed children&#x27;s book entitled, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me, Santa Claus&quot; through Barrons Juveniles Publishers.

==Personal life==

Mayo wed actor Michael O&#x27;Shea in 1947, and they remained married until he died in 1973. The couple had one child, Mary Catherine O&#x27;Shea (born in 1953). For several decades, the family lived in Thousand Oaks, California.

In later years, she developed a passion for painting and also occupied her time doting on her three grandsons. She converted to Roman Catholicism, inspired by Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. A lifelong Republican, she endorsed Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, and longtime friend Ronald Reagan in 1980.

==Death==
Mayo died of pneumonia and complications of congestive heart failure in the Los Angeles area on January 17, 2005, aged 84, at a nursing home in Thousand Oaks. Her death was reported the next day in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She is buried next to O&#x27;Shea in Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Park in Westlake Village, California.

<doc id="1001325" wikidata="Q783192" url="?curid=1001325" title="Condemnations of 1210–1277">
<text>The Condemnations at the medieval University of Paris were enacted to restrict certain teachings as being heretical. These included a number of medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing up a list of condemnations is unclear.

Approximately sixteen lists of censured theses were issued by the University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put together into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider that they encouraged scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.

==Condemnation of 1210==
The Condemnation of 1210 was issued by the provincial synod of Sens, which included the Bishop of Paris as a member (at the time ). The writings of a number of medieval scholars were condemned, apparently for pantheism, and it was further stated that: &quot;Neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication.&quot; However, this had only local force, and its application was further restricted to the Arts faculty at the University of Paris. Theologians were therefore left free to read the prohibited works, the titles of which were not even specified. Alexander of Aphrodisias was probably among the Aristotelian commentators whose influence was targeted.

The University of Toulouse (founded in 1229) tried to capitalise on the situation by advertising itself to students: &quot;Those who wish to scrutinize the bosom of nature to the inmost can hear the books of Aristotle which were forbidden at Paris.&quot; However, whether the prohibition had actually had an effect on the study of the physical texts in Paris is unclear. English scholars, including Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon, studied at Paris, when they could have chosen to study at the University of Oxford, where the works could still be discussed in public. It is assumed that at the least they continued to be read in Paris in private, and there are also signs that their discussion had become public by 1240.

==Condemnation of 1270==
By 1270, the ban on Aristotle&#x27;s natural philosophy was a dead letter. Nevertheless, the Bishop of Paris, Étienne Tempier, convened a meeting of conservative theologians and in December 1270 banned the teaching of certain Aristotelian and Averroist doctrines at Paris. Thirteen propositions were listed as false and heretical, some relating to Averroes&#x27; doctrine of the soul and the doctrine of monopsychism, and others directed against Aristotle&#x27;s theory of God as a passive unmoved mover. The banned propositions included:
*&quot;That there is numerically one and the same intellect for all humans&quot;.
*&quot;That the soul separated [from the body] by death cannot suffer from bodily fire&quot;.
*&quot;That God cannot grant immortality and incorruption to a mortal and corruptible thing&quot;.
*&quot;That God does not know singulars&quot; (i.e., individual objects or creatures).
*&quot;That God does not know things other than Himself&quot;.
*&quot;That human acts are not ruled by the providence of God&quot;.
*&quot;That the world is eternal&quot;.
*&quot;That there was never a first human&quot;.

Those who &quot;knowingly&quot; taught or asserted them as true would suffer automatic excommunication, with the implied threat of the medieval Inquisition if they persisted. It is not known which of these statements were &quot;taught knowingly&quot; or &quot;asserted&quot; by teachers at Paris, although Siger of Brabant and his radical Averroist colleagues at the Faculty of Arts were targets. Evidently, the radical masters had taught that Aristotle put forward controversial propositions—which according to the Averroists would have been true at least in philosophy, even if rejected in theology—the doctrine of two truths—and questions such as free will and the immortality of the soul were doubtless subject to scholarly debate between masters and students. However, it seems &quot;inconceivable&quot; that any teacher would deny God&#x27;s Providence.

==Condemnation of 1277==
The chain of events leading up to Bishop Tempier&#x27;s condemnation of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle&#x27;s teachings on the eternity of the world and the unicity of the intellect.

On 18 January 1277, Pope John XXI instructed Bishop Tempier to investigate the complaints of the theologians. &quot;Not only did Tempier investigate but in only three weeks, on his own authority, he issued a condemnation of 219 propositions drawn from many sources, including, apparently, the works of Thomas Aquinas, some of whose ideas found their way onto the list.&quot; The list published on 7 March condemned a great number of &quot;errors&quot;, some of which emanated from the astrology, and others from the philosophy of the Peripatetics. These included:

*9. &quot;That there was no first man, nor will there be a last; on the contrary, there always was and always will be generation of man from man.&quot;
*49. &quot;That God could not move the heavens with rectilinear motion; and the reason is that a vacuum would remain.&quot;
*87. &quot;That the world is eternal as to all the species contained in it; and that time is eternal, as are motion, matter, agent, and recipient; and because the world is from the infinite power of God, it is impossible that there be novelty in an effect without novelty in the cause.&quot;

The penalty for anyone teaching or listening to the listed errors was excommunication, &quot;unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the chancellor within seven days, in which case the bishop would inflict proportionate penalties.&quot; The condemnation sought to stop the Master of Arts teachers from interpreting the works of Aristotle in ways that were contrary to the beliefs of the Church. In addition to the 219 errors, the condemnation also covered Andreas Capellanus&#x27;s &quot;De amore&quot;, and unnamed or unidentified treatises on geomancy, necromancy, witchcraft, or fortunetelling.

The condemnation of 1277 was later partially annulled &quot;insofar as the teachings of Thomas Aquinas would seem to be implied.&quot;

===Assessment===

The long list has often been labelled as not being particularly organised, and that it is &quot;broad in scope to the point of confusion.&quot; However, the order on the roll has been attributed to factors such as the order in which the errors appeared in the examined works. The list was reorganised shortly after 1277, possibly to facilitate its use in the academic community. In the 20th century, the articles were once again reorganised by Dominican historian Pierre Mandonnet, numbering and distinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from the 40 theological ones. The list was summarised into groupings and further explained by John F. Wippel. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; also emphasised that &quot;Tempier&#x27;s theses express positions that cannot be maintained in light of revealed truth, and for this reason are each followed by the qualification &#x27;error&#x27;.&quot;

Another problem was that Tempier did not identify the targets of his condemnation, merely indicating that it was directed against unspecified members of the Arts Faculty in Paris. Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia have been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277 censure, even though their names are not found in the document itself, appearing instead in the rubrics of only two of the many manuscripts that preserve the condemnation. These two scholars were important proponents of the Averroist movement. The ground-breaking study by the historian Roland Hissette has shown that many of the censured propositions appear to have come from Aristotle, from Arab philosophers, or from &quot;the philosophers&quot; (i.e. other Greek philosophers).

The role that Pope John XXI played in the lead-up to the condemnations is a more recent point of discussion. Because the papal letter preceded Tempier&#x27;s condemnation by only about six weeks, the traditional assumption was that Tempier had acted on papal initiative, and in an overzealous and hasty way. However, more than forty days after Tempier produced his list, another papal letter gives no indication that the Pope was as yet aware of Tempier&#x27;s action, and seems to suggest otherwise. It is therefore possible that Tempier had already been preparing his condemnations prior to receiving the Pope&#x27;s first letter. The Pope himself had not played any direct role in the condemnations, having merely requested an investigation, and one scholar has argued that there was &quot;less than enthusiastic papal approval of the bishop of Paris&#x27; actions.&quot;

===Effects===

Pierre Duhem considered that these condemnations &quot;destroyed certain essential foundations of Peripatetic physics&quot;. Although the Aristotelian system viewed propositions such as the existence of a vacuum to be ridiculously untenable, belief in Divine Omnipotence sanctioned them as possible, whilst waiting for science to confirm them as true. From at least 1280 onward, many masters at Paris and Oxford admitted that the laws of nature are certainly opposed to the production of empty space, but that the realisation of such a space is not, in itself, contrary to reason. These arguments gave rise to the branch of mechanical science known as dynamics.

Pierre Duhem and Edward Grant state this caused a break from Aristotle&#x27;s work and forced the teachers of the time to believe Aristotle&#x27;s work imperfect. According to Duhem, &quot;if we must assign a date for the birth of modern science, we would, without doubt, choose the year 1277 when the bishop of Paris solemnly proclaimed that several worlds could exist, and that the whole of heavens could, without contradiction, be moved with a rectilinear motion.&quot;

Duhem&#x27;s view has been extremely influential in the historiography of medieval science, and opened it up as a serious academic discipline. &quot;Duhem believed that Tempier, with his insistence of God&#x27;s absolute power, had liberated Christian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, and in this way marked the birth of modern science.&quot; The condemnations certainly had a positive effect on science, but scholars disagree over their relative influence. Historians in the field no longer fully endorse his view that modern science started in 1277. Edward Grant&#x27;s views on the subject perhaps approximate closest Duhem&#x27;s, though Grant&#x27;s are more refined and benefit from the greater materials available to him. What historians do agree upon is that the condemnations allowed science &quot;to consider possibilities that the great philosopher never envisioned.&quot; According to the historian of science Richard Dales, they &quot;seem definitely to have promoted a freer and more imaginative way of doing science.&quot;

Others point out that in philosophy, a critical and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out the negative consequences of uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments can be traced back to 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham&#x27;s first thesis.

Ockham&#x27;s second thesis was the principle of parsimony: also known as Ockham&#x27;s razor. This developed a new form of logic, based on an empiricist theory of knowledge. &quot;While Scholastic in setting,&quot; as David Lindberg writes, it was &quot;thoroughly modern in orientation. Referred to as the &quot;via moderna&quot;, in opposition to the &quot;via antiqua&quot; of the earlier scholastics, it has been seen as a forerunner of a modern age of analysis.&quot; Other, even more skeptical thinkers in the mid-14th century included John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt. It has been suggested that the new philosophy of nature that emerged from the rise of Skepticism following the Condemnations, contained &quot;the seeds from which modern science could arise in the early seventeenth century.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, especially in the fields of group theory and representation theory of groups, a class function is a function on a group &quot;G&quot; that is constant on the conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;. In other words, it is invariant under the conjugation map on &quot;G&quot;. Such functions play a basic role in representation theory.

==Characters==
The character of a linear representation of &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; is always a class function with values in &quot;K&quot;. The class functions form the center of the group ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. Here a class function &quot;f&quot; is identified with the element formula_1.

== Inner products ==
The set of class functions of a group with values in a field form a -vector space. If is finite and the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of , then there is an inner product defined on this space defined by formula_2 where denotes the order of and the overbar denotes conjugation in the field . The set of irreducible characters of forms an orthogonal basis. Further, if is a splitting field for for instance, if is algebraically closed, then the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis.

When is a compact group and is the field of complex numbers, the Haar measure can be applied to replace the finite sum above with an integral: formula_3

When is the real numbers or the complex numbers, the inner product is a non-degenerate Hermitian bilinear form.

<text>Electrodermal activity (EDA) is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin. Historically, EDA has also been known as skin conductance, galvanic skin response (GSR), electrodermal response (EDR), psychogalvanic reflex (PGR), skin conductance response (SCR), sympathetic skin response (SSR) and skin conductance level (SCL). The long history of research into the active and passive electrical properties of the skin by a variety of disciplines has resulted in an excess of names, now standardized to electrodermal activity (EDA).

The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and skin conductance is an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. If the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is highly aroused, then sweat gland activity also increases, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses. More recent research and additional phenomena (resistance, potential, impedance, electrochemical skin conductance, and admittance, sometimes responsive and sometimes apparently spontaneous) suggest that EDA is more complex than it seems, and research continues into the source and significance of EDA.

==History==
In 1849, Dubois-Reymond in Germany first observed that human skin was electrically active. He immersed the limbs of his subjects in a zinc sulfate solution and found that electric current flowed between a limb with muscles contracted and one that was relaxed. He therefore attributed his EDA observations to muscular phenomena. Thirty years later, in 1878 in Switzerland, Hermann and Luchsinger demonstrated a connection between EDA and sweat glands. Hermann later demonstrated that the electrical effect was strongest in the palms of the hands, suggesting that sweat was an important factor.

Vigouroux (France, 1879), working with emotionally distressed patients, was the first researcher to relate EDA to psychological activity. In 1888, the French neurologist Féré demonstrated that skin resistance activity could be changed by emotional stimulation and that activity could be inhibited by drugs.

In 1889 in Russia, Ivane Tarkhnishvili observed variations in skin electrical potentials in the absence of any external stimuli, and he developed a meter to observe the variations as they happened in real time.

The scientific study of EDA began in the early 1900s. One of the first references to the use of EDA instruments in psychoanalysis is the book by C. G. Jung entitled &quot;Studies in Word Analysis&quot;, published in 1906. Jung and his colleagues used the meter to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung was so impressed with EDA monitoring, he allegedly cried, &quot;Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!&quot; Jung described his use of the device in counseling in his book, &quot;Studies in Word Association&quot;, and such use has continued with various practitioners.

The controversial Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich also studied EDA in his experiments at the Psychological Institute at the University of Oslo, in 1935 and 1936, to confirm the existence of a bio-electrical charge behind his concept of vegetative, pleasurable &quot;streamings&quot;.

By 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as the most popular method for investigating human psychophysiological phenomena. As of 2013, EDA monitoring was still on the increase in clinical applications.

==Description==
Skin conductance is not under conscious control. Instead, it is modulated autonomously by sympathetic activity which drives human behavior, cognitive and emotional states on a subconscious level. Skin conductance, therefore, offers direct insights into autonomous emotional regulation.

Human extremities, including fingers, palms, and soles of feet display different bio-electrical phenomena. They can be detected with an EDA meter, a device that displays the change in electrical conductance between two points over time. The two current paths are along the surface of the skin and through the body. Active measuring involves sending a small amount of current through the body.

Some studies include the human skin&#x27;s response to alternating current, including recently deceased bodies.

===Physiological basis===
There is a relationship between emotional arousal and sympathetic activity, although the electrical change alone does not identify which specific emotion is being elicited. These autonomic sympathetic changes alter sweat and blood flow, which in turn affects GSR and GSP (Galvanic skin potential). The amount of sweat glands varies across the human body, being highest in hand and foot regions (200–600 sweat glands per cm2). The response of the skin and muscle tissue to external and internal stimuli can cause the conductance to vary by several microsiemens. A correctly calibrated device can record and display the subtle changes.

The combined changes between electrodermal resistance and electrodermal potential make up electrodermal activity. Galvanic skin resistance (GSR) is an older term that refers to the recorded electrical resistance between two electrodes when a very weak current is steadily passed between them. The electrodes are normally placed about an inch apart, and the resistance recorded varies according to the emotional state of the subject. Galvanic skin potential (GSP) refers to the voltage measured between two electrodes without any externally applied current. It is measured by connecting the electrodes to a voltage amplifier. This voltage also varies with the emotional state of the subject.

====Examples====
A painful stimulus such as a pinprick elicits a sympathetic response by the sweat glands, increasing secretion. Although this increase is generally very small, sweat contains water and electrolytes, which increase electrical conductivity, thus lowering the electrical resistance of the skin. These changes in turn affect GSR. Another common manifestation is the vasodilation (dilation) of blood vessels in the face, referred to as blushing, as well as increased sweating that occurs when one is embarrassed.

EDA is highly responsive to emotions in some people. Fear, anger, startled response, orienting response, and sexual feelings are among the reactions that may be reflected in EDA. These responses are utilized as part of the polygraph or lie detector test.

EDA in regular subjects differs according to feelings of being treated fairly or unfairly, but psychopaths have been shown to manifest no such differences. This indicates that the EDA record of a polygraph may be deceptive in a criminal investigation.

=== Different units of EDA ===
EDA reflects both slow varying &quot;tonic&quot; sympathetic activity and fast varying &quot;phasic&quot; sympathetic activity. Tonic activity can be expressed in units of electrodermal level (EDL or SCL), while phasic activity is expressed in units of electrodermal responses (EDR or SCR).

Phasic changes (EDR) are short-lasting changes in EDA that appear as a response to a distinct stimulus. EDRs can also appear spontaneously without an observable external stimulus. These types of EDRs are referred to as &quot;nonspecific EDR&quot; (NS.EDR). The phasic EDR is useful when investigating multifaceted attentional processes.

Tonic changes (EDL) are based on the phasic parameters. The spontaneous fluctuations of nonspecific EDR can be used to evaluate tonic EDA. More specifically by using the frequency of &quot;nonspecific EDR&quot; as an index of EDA during a specific time period, e. g. 30–60 seconds. Tonic EDA is considered useful in investigations of general arousal and alertness.

==Uses==
EDA is a common measure of autonomic nervous system activity, with a long history of being used in psychological research. Hugo D. Critchley, Chair of Psychiatry at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School states, &quot;EDA is a sensitive psychophysiological index of changes in autonomic sympathetic arousal that are integrated with emotional and cognitive states.&quot; Many biofeedback therapy devices utilize EDA as an indicator of the user&#x27;s stress response with the goal of helping the user to control anxiety. EDA is used to assess an individual&#x27;s neurological status without using traditional, but uncomfortable and expensive, EEG-based monitoring.
It has also been used as a proxy of psychological stress.

EDA has also been studied as a method of pain assessment in premature born infants.

Often, EDA monitoring is combined with the recording of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, because they are all autonomically dependent variables. EDA measurement is one component of modern polygraph devices, which are often used as lie detectors.

The E-meter used by the Church of Scientology as part of its practice of &quot;auditing&quot; and &quot;security checking&quot;, is a custom EDA measurement device.

==Possible problems==
External factors such as temperature and humidity affect EDA measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results. Internal factors such as medications and hydration can also change EDA measurements, demonstrating inconsistency with the same stimulus level. Also, the classic understanding has treated EDA as if it represented one homogeneous change in arousal across the body, but in fact different locations of its measurement can lead to different responses; for example, the responses on the left and right wrists are driven by different regions of the brain, providing multiple sources of arousal; thus, the EDA measured in different places on the body varies not only with different sweat gland density but also with different underlying sources of arousal. 
Lastly, electrodermal responses are delayed 1–3 seconds. These show the complexity of determining the relationship between EDA and sympathetic activity. The skill of the operator may be a significant factor in the successful application of the tool.

<text>El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, commonly known as El Gran Combo, is a Puerto Rican salsa orchestra based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2012, it was often considered Puerto Rico&#x27;s most successful musical group. The group received the moniker &quot;La Universidad de la Salsa&quot; (The University of Salsa) in Colombia, due to the sheer number of famous salsa musicians and singers who developed their careers with it, who started with the group (particularly Andy Montañez), or who were occasionally backed up by the band and La India.

The salsa orchestra was founded in May 1962, by Rafael Ithier. Ithier was still nominally its musical director, and is the only remaining member from the band&#x27;s original lineup. From 2010 until his death in 2022, Willie Sotelo, who joined the group in 2006 as pianist, had become the band&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; musical director on tours, with Ithier conducting the group and playing occasionally in select live performances. They are still actively performing after 50 years together. The group was scheduled to celebrate its 50th anniversary on 11 November 2012 at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico. The group started its celebration with a grand world tour that took them to five continents.

On November 24, 2022, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, on its 60th anniversary, was featured on Norberto Vélez&#x27;s YouTube channel titled &quot;Sesiones Desde La Loma Ep. 32&quot;. El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico is the first Orchestra featured at the hill.

==History==

===Inception===
Rafael Ithier had been a member of Rafael Cortijo&#x27;s &quot;Cortijo y su Combo&quot; orchestra. After singer Ismael Rivera faced legal drug possession problems when arriving from Panama, some of the group&#x27;s musicians departed, with Ithier relocating temporarily to the eastern United States. Rafael Álvarez Guedes, the Cuban-born owner of the Gema recording label (and brother of comedic actor Guillermo) needed a backing band to record an album for legendary Dominican merengue singer Joseíto Mateo. He asked Ithier for assistance, and Ithier responded by bringing in many of his former colleagues return to the studio. For their first recording sessions, the orchestra included some musicians from Cortijo&#x27;s original lineup, including saxophonist Hector Santos, trumpet player Rogelio &quot;Kito&quot; Velez, and percussionists Martín Quiñones, Miguel Cruz and Roberto Roena. Alvarez-Guedes proposed to call it Rafael Ithier y su Combo. This was in obvious similarity to Rafael Cortijo y su Combo. Ithier opposed the idea mainly because he was so frustrated with the situation that happened with Cortijo, that he wasn’t thinking of staying around much longer than a few months. Since the word “combo” was in vogue those days for mid-size bands, the group landed with a name that would reflect a “new and improved” combo, a great combo; El Gran Combo. The album they recorded was titled &quot;Menéame Los Mangos, El Gran Combo con Joseito Mateo&quot; (the phrase translates as &quot;Shake Your Mangoes for Me,&quot; a double entendre).

The group met again to define the foundations of a proper orchestra and chose singers Daniel Vázquez, Pellín Rodríguez and Chiquitín García (who later composed among other major EGC hits, &quot;&quot;No Hago Más Ná&quot;,&quot; and many of Gran Combo&#x27;s hits). On May 21, 1962, El Gran Combo was heard for the first time on Puerto Rican radio. Later on, they became the in-studio musicians of the live television show, &quot;La Taberna India&quot;, sponsored by India Beer.

After their live debut at Hotel La Concha in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Chiquitín García left the orchestra. Vocalist Sammy Ayala, who had also played with Ithier in the Cortijo orchestra, recommended the hiring of Andy Montañez. Andy Montañez was singer for a trio in Puerto Rico and had never sung salsa?

===First albums===
On November 20, 1963, El Gran Combo released their first group album, &quot;Menéame los mangos&quot;, with Joseito Mateo as lead singer. Later came &quot;Acángana&quot;. This album became a number-one hit in New York City, Panama and Puerto Rico. Their success opened doors for them in many Latin American markets and they gained an exclusivity spot on the Puerto Rican television show &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;. The album also reached gold status.

In 1964, trumpet player and arranger Elías Lopes joined the orchestra, coinciding with the group&#x27;s first popularity wave. With their daily TV appearances and extensive touring, however, demand for the group declined due to overexposure. Still, in 1967, their album &quot;Boogaloo con el Gran Combo&quot; also reached gold status. In 1969, Roena and Lopes left the orchestra to form the &quot;Apollo Sound&quot; together. Despite all this, that same year the group was awarded an &quot;Agüeybana de Oro&quot; in Puerto Rico. Also, in 1969, Rafael Ithier hired dancer/choreographer Mike Ramos to implement dance routines, which became a signature of El Gran Combo&#x27;s live performances. Mike came from the world-famous New York City Palladium Ballroom scene. Prior to joining El Gran Combo, Mike danced with the Tito Puente Orchestra and Perez Prado Band among others.

===The 1970s===
In 1970, El Gran Combo&#x27;s contract with Gema Records was not renewed. Despite offers from other record companies including the Motown label, the group decided to self-release recordings under their own newly created independent label, Combo Records (alternatively known as EGC Records). The first album released on the label was the 1970 album entitled &quot;Estamos Primeros&quot;. On February 15, 1970, the members of &quot;El Gran Combo&quot; shared a near death experience. They were at Venezuela, and scheduled to fly the following day to Las Américas International Airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. After landing they were told about the Dominicana Airlines DC-9 that crashed off the Caribbean coast which occurred the night before. Therefore, the tale about a group member having a bad feeling regarding that flight while stranded at the Santo Domingo airport is not entirely true, since they did not arrive there until the day after the crash.

In 1971, El Gran Combo introduced the trombone to their instrument mix. The trombone was played by Fanny Ceballos. Soon after, their production named &quot;De Punta a Punta&quot; was released. In 1972, they released the album &quot;Por el Libro&quot;, which marks the 10th anniversary of the orchestra. Pellín Rodriguez left the group to embark on a solo career. Rodríguez was replaced by Charlie Aponte at the recommendation of Jerry Concepción and the well known sportscaster Rafael Bracero, both friends of Ithier.

In 1973, El Gran Combo sang in front of 50,000 fans at the famous Yankee Stadium in New York City as the opening act for the Fania All-Stars&#x27; sold-out concert.

Montañez left the band in early 1977 and went to live in Venezuela where he replaced Oscar D&#x27;León in another orchestra, Dimension Latina. Jerry Rivas was then chosen to join the orchestra. The success of this new duo was proved with their 1977 album &quot;International&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;En Las Vegas&quot; which reached gold record status.

In 1966, &quot;En Navidad&quot;, a Christmas album, was released, with Martín Quiñones appearing as Santa Claus in the album&#x27;s cover. After an automobile accident in early 1977, Quiñones was replaced in the band by his son, Martín Quiñones Jr. He stayed until 1979, being replaced by Miguel “El Pollo” Torres.

===Recent years===
The band continues to receive numerous awards throughout Latin America. In 1984, they traveled to Alaska where they received a great welcome. Soon after Combo Records released their album titled &quot;In Alaska: Breaking the Ice&quot;. Produced by Ralph Cartagena, the album garnered them their first Grammy nomination.

In 1982 they celebrated their 20th anniversary playing at Madison Square Garden. They also reached Europe that year playing in Paris, France.

In the early 1990s, they were honored in the city of Madrid, Spain to open the decade on the right track. On March 29, 1992, they celebrated a huge concert in the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in front of 30,000 people.

===The new millennium===
In 2000, El Gran Combo was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. In 2002, the group celebrated their 40th anniversary with two sold-out concerts at the Ruben Rodríguez Coliseum in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. This celebration spawned an album. In the same year, they were awarded the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award. Among other musicians, they are one of the &quot;enduring superstars of the island.&quot;

, the orchestra has released over 40 albums or CD&#x27;s, and it has received many awards, including golden albums, a &quot;Calendario de Plata&quot; in Mexico, a &quot;Golden Congo&quot; in Colombia, a Paoli Award in their native Puerto Rico, an honorable distinction in Spain and countless others.

In 2006, they released their album titled &quot;Arroz con Habichuela&quot; (&quot;Rice and Beans&quot;). It has already spawned three hit singles. The first one titled &quot;No Hay Manera&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s No Way&quot;), the title song, and &quot;Si la ves por ahí&quot;.

Around 2006, Rafael Ithier became ill and decided to take a back seat for live performances and although he mostly still tours with the band, Ithier is just conducting the combo rather than playing the piano, however he is still very much the bandleader of the group. Willie Sotelo took the place of Ithier on the piano and also took over some of the travel management duties.

In 2007, El Gran Combo performed two massive concerts at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum to celebrate their 45th anniversary.

In 2010, two tribute albums were released, one by former member Andy Montañez and another by the bank Banco Popular, as part of their annual music series.

In August 2011, El Gran Combo rewrote the lyrics to their own hit &quot;No Hago Más Ná&quot;, or &quot;I Don&#x27;t Do Anything Else&quot; that sang in satire about the day of a lazy person to a more positive &quot;Echar Pa&#x27;lante&quot; or &quot;Moving Forward&quot; which sang about the virtues of going to work. They also released a video with a positive introductory message which showed clips of working people in similarities with them playing instruments.

The group is still going strong and working continuously. Some music historians have dubbed them &quot;La Universidad de la Salsa&quot; (The University of Salsa), which is also the title of their hit 1983 album.

Recent changes have occurred within the last several years. On August 9, 2013, Founder musician Eddie &quot;La Bala&quot; Perez died due to health complications. On December 12, 2014, Charlie Aponte, one of the vocalists of El Gran Combo for 41 years, retired for personal reasons and launched his own orchestra. His last performance was in Cali, Colombia on December 30, 2014. On January 24, 2015 Anthony Garcia became the new vocalist, as Aponte&#x27;s replacement. Later in the year, El Gran Combo received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Two years later, they were presented with the ASCAP Latin Heritage Award. In early 2019, Luis &quot;Papo&quot; Rosario, the main choreographer and third vocalist since 1980, retired. Joselito Hernández was added as Rosario&#x27;s replacement.

<text>Colonel Charles Swinhoe (27 August 1838 in Calcutta – 2 December 1923) was an English naturalist and lepidopterist, who served in the British Army in India. He was one of the eight founders of the Bombay Natural History Society and a brother of the famous naturalist Robert Swinhoe.

Swinhoe was commissioned ensign in the 56th Regiment of Foot without purchase in 1855, serving in the Crimea and reaching India after the 1857 Mutiny. He exchanged into a lieutenancy in the 15th Foot without purchase in 1858 and returned to the 56th Foot in 1859, transferring to the Bombay Staff Corps later the same year. He was at Kandahar with Lord Roberts in 1880, and collected 341 birds there and on the march back to India. These were described in &quot;The Ibis&quot; (1882: 95–126). He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1881 and colonel in 1885.

Swinhoe was a keen &quot;shikari&quot; and had shot 50–60 tigers. He was also a member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union and contributed papers to &quot;The Ibis&quot; on the birds of southern Afghanistan and central India, and donated 300 bird skins from each country to the British Museum. While at Mhow he collaborated with Lieutenant Henry Edwin Barnes on the birds of central India. (&quot;Ibis&quot; 1885: 62–69, 124–138) He collected insects, chiefly Lepidoptera from Bombay, Poona, Mhow and Karachi districts. He had one of the largest collections of Indian Lepidoptera at the time (40,000 specimens of 7,000 species and 400 new species described by him), and completed the &quot;Lepidoptera Indica&quot; series after the death of Frederic Moore in 1907. He also published in the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;. He also wrote &quot;A Revision of the Genera of the Family Liparidae&quot; which covered 1130 entries and published a &quot;Catalogue of the Moths of India&quot; (Calcutta, 1887–89) with Everard Charles Cotes. After retirement he settled at Oxford and received an honorary M.A. for his work in entomology. The Entomological Society of France made him an honorary member. His Lepidoptera collection was purchased by James John Joicey.

<text>Styra (, also Χωριό - &quot;Chorio&quot;) is a village and a former municipality on the island Euboea, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Karystos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 188.583 km2. It is located in the southern part of Euboea, facing the eastern shore of Attica across the South Euboean Gulf. Nowadays it can be reached by ferryboat from the tiny harbor of Agia Marina, as well as by bridge from Chalcis.
the Stouronisi (Styra Island).takes its name from the town of Styra.

==Population==

Actually there are two towns, Nea Styra or ( Beach &quot;Paralia&quot;) &quot;(New)&quot; and Styra or &quot;Chorio&quot; &quot;(Old)&quot;. The Nea Styra or &quot;Paralia&quot; is a more modern tourist area with beautiful views, beaches, hotels, cafes, bookstores, nightclubs, shops, and bars. There are two doctors in Styra that share time between Nea Styra and Styra or &quot;Chorio&quot;. In between Nea Styra and Styra is the ancient city of Styra, a city mentioned by Homer&#x27;s Iliad (Rhapsody B). Ships left from the ancient city state of Styra to aid in the rescue of Helen of Troy.

==History==

Near Styra there are ancient structures standing which are 4,500 years old and are constructed using Megalithic Architecture. They are called Drakospita (i.e. dragon houses) and have been built using huge one piece stones (monoliths). The size of each of these stones is 4.0m length x 2.5m width x 1.5m height, similar to those found in the Philippines and at Stonehenge. Styra is a Arvanitika speaking community.

<doc id="1001361" wikidata="Q1485102" url="?curid=1001361" title="Semisimple module">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, a semisimple module or completely reducible module is a type of module that can be understood easily from its parts. A ring that is a semisimple module over itself is known as an Artinian semisimple ring. Some important rings, such as group rings of finite groups over fields of characteristic zero, are semisimple rings. An Artinian ring is initially understood via its largest semisimple quotient. The structure of Artinian semisimple rings is well understood by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem, which exhibits these rings as finite direct products of matrix rings.

For a group-theory analog of the same notion, see &quot;Semisimple representation&quot;.

== Definition ==
A module over a (not necessarily commutative) ring is said to be semisimple (or completely reducible) if it is the direct sum of simple (irreducible) submodules.

For a module &quot;M&quot;, the following are equivalent:
# &quot;M&quot; is semisimple; i.e., a direct sum of irreducible modules.
# &quot;M&quot; is the sum of its irreducible submodules.
# Every submodule of &quot;M&quot; is a direct summand: for every submodule &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot;, there is a complement &quot;P&quot; such that .
For the proof of the equivalences, see &quot;&quot;.

The most basic example of a semisimple module is a module over a field, i.e., a vector space. On the other hand, the ring of integers is not a semisimple module over itself, since the submodule is not a direct summand.

Semisimple is stronger than completely decomposable,
which is a direct sum of indecomposable submodules.

Let &quot;A&quot; be an algebra over a field &quot;K&quot;. Then a left module &quot;M&quot; over &quot;A&quot; is said to be absolutely semisimple if, for any field extension &quot;F&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, is a semisimple module over .

== Properties ==
* If &quot;M&quot; is semisimple and &quot;N&quot; is a submodule, then &quot;N&quot; and are also semisimple.
* An arbitrary direct sum of semisimple modules is semisimple.
* A module &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated and semisimple if and only if it is Artinian and its radical is zero.

== Endomorphism rings ==
* A semisimple module &quot;M&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot; can also be thought of as a ring homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; into the ring of abelian group endomorphisms of &quot;M&quot;. The image of this homomorphism is a semiprimitive ring, and every semiprimitive ring is isomorphic to such an image.
* The endomorphism ring of a semisimple module is not only semiprimitive, but also von Neumann regular.

== Semisimple rings ==

A ring is said to be (left-)semisimple if it is semisimple as a left module over itself. Surprisingly, a left-semisimple ring is also right-semisimple and vice versa. The left/right distinction is therefore unnecessary, and one can speak of semisimple rings without ambiguity.

A semisimple ring may be characterized in terms of homological algebra: namely, a ring &quot;R&quot; is semisimple if and only if any short exact sequence of left (or right) &quot;R&quot;-modules splits. That is, for a short exact sequence
: formula_1
there exists such that the composition is the identity. The map &quot;s&quot; is known as a section. From this it follows that
: formula_2
or in more exact terms
: formula_3

In particular, any module over a semisimple ring is injective and projective. Since &quot;projective&quot; implies &quot;flat&quot;, a semisimple ring is a von Neumann regular ring.

Semisimple rings are of particular interest to algebraists. For example, if the base ring &quot;R&quot; is semisimple, then all &quot;R&quot;-modules would automatically be semisimple. Furthermore, every simple (left) &quot;R&quot;-module is isomorphic to a minimal left ideal of &quot;R&quot;, that is, &quot;R&quot; is a left Kasch ring.

Semisimple rings are both Artinian and Noetherian. From the above properties, a ring is semisimple if and only if it is Artinian and its Jacobson radical is zero.

If an Artinian semisimple ring contains a field as a central subring, it is called a semisimple algebra.

=== Examples ===
* For a commutative ring, the four following properties are equivalent: being a semisimple ring; being artinian and reduced; being a reduced Noetherian ring of Krull dimension 0; and being isomorphic to a finite direct product of fields.
* If &quot;K&quot; is a field and &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of order &quot;n&quot;, then the group ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is semisimple if and only if the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; does not divide &quot;n&quot;. This is Maschke&#x27;s theorem, an important result in group representation theory.
* By the Wedderburn–Artin theorem, a unital ring &quot;R&quot; is semisimple if and only if it is (isomorphic to) , where each &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a division ring and each &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a positive integer, and M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) denotes the ring of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries in &quot;D&quot;.
* An example of a semisimple non-unital ring is M∞(&quot;K&quot;), the row-finite, column-finite, infinite matrices over a field &quot;K&quot;.

=== Simple rings ===
One should beware that despite the terminology, &quot;not all simple rings are semisimple&quot;. The problem is that the ring may be &quot;too big&quot;, that is, not (left/right) Artinian. In fact, if &quot;R&quot; is a simple ring with a minimal left/right ideal, then &quot;R&quot; is semisimple.

Classic examples of simple, but not semisimple, rings are the Weyl algebras, such as the Q-algebra
: formula_4
which is a simple noncommutative domain. These and many other nice examples are discussed in more detail in several noncommutative ring theory texts, including chapter 3 of Lam&#x27;s text, in which they are described as nonartinian simple rings. The module theory for the Weyl algebras is well studied and differs significantly from that of semisimple rings.

=== Jacobson semisimple ===

A ring is called &quot;Jacobson semisimple&quot; (or &quot;J-semisimple&quot; or &quot;semiprimitive&quot;) if the intersection of the maximal left ideals is zero, that is, if the Jacobson radical is zero. Every ring that is semisimple as a module over itself has zero Jacobson radical, but not every ring with zero Jacobson radical is semisimple as a module over itself. A J-semisimple ring is semisimple if and only if it is an artinian ring, so semisimple rings are often called &quot;artinian semisimple rings&quot; to avoid confusion.

For example, the ring of integers, Z, is J-semisimple, but not artinian semisimple.

<text>The Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 is a British two-seat biplane reconnaissance and bomber aircraft of the First World War that was designed and produced at the Royal Aircraft Factory. It was also built under contract by Austin Motors, Daimler, Standard Motors, Siddeley-Deasy and the Coventry Ordnance Works.

Intended as a replacement for the vulnerable B.E.2, the R.E.8 was widely regarded as more difficult to fly and gained a reputation in the Royal Flying Corps for being &quot;unsafe&quot; that was never entirely dispelled. Although eventually it gave reasonably satisfactory service, it was never an outstanding combat aircraft. Nonetheless, it remained the standard British reconnaissance and artillery observation aircraft from mid-1917 to the end of the war, serving alongside the rather more popular Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8.

More than 4,000 R.E.8s were eventually produced; these aircraft saw service in a range of different theatres, including Italy, Russia, Palestine and Mesopotamia, as well as the Western Front. The R.E.8 was rapidly withdrawn from service after the end of the war, by which time it was regarded as totally obsolete.

==Development==

===Background===
Design of the new type had begun in late 1915, so that it was conceptually at least almost contemporary with the B.E.12 and the B.E.2e – like these earlier types, it was designed for inherent stability in line with the dominant pre-war belief in the necessity of stability to perform the aerial observation role.

The B.E.2 had already been subject to considerable criticism, and a deliberate effort was made to address each of the earlier type&#x27;s failings. In particular, the more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload; this permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater: the observer no longer had to be left behind when bombs or a full fuel load were carried. There was no need for his seat to be at the centre of gravity; seated behind the pilot, instead of in front as in the B.E.2, he was in the proper position to operate a machine-gun. Another consequence of the additional engine power was the possibility of fitting a forward-mounted gun for the pilot.

===Design and testing===
As early as March 1916, the design appears to have mostly been settled; features included the selection of a Royal Aircraft Factory 4a air-cooled V12 engine (capable of 140 hp) to power the type along with a sizable fin and rudder. During the early design process, a smaller tail fin was substituted for the original, a step which later caused some controversy. By early April 1916 a mock-up of the R.E.8 had been completed, and construction of a pair of prototypes was underway. On 16 June 1916, the first of these prototypes was submitted for its final pre-flight inspection in advance of the type&#x27;s maiden flight.

On 17 June 1916, the first R.E.8 test flight was conducted by F.W. Goodden. Goodden would perform all of the early flights with the type; on 1 July 1916, Sefton Brancker was flown by Goodden in the type to Hounslow, London. On 16 July 1916, the second prototype, furnished with a different design of propeller, performed its first flight. During late July 1916, the second of two prototypes was dispatched to France for service trials, the results of which were largely successful, with aircrew being generally quite favourably impressed. During August 1916, the second prototype returned to Farnborough, Hampshire, where it underwent modification based upon its experiences in France.

The R.E.8 possessed a conventional wire-braced fabric-covered wooden structure, along with an unequal-span wing arrangement. The engine installation closely resembled that of the B.E.12, complete with the same large air scoop and similar vertically mounted exhausts protruding over the upper wing to carry the fumes clear of the crew. Apart from the disposition of the cockpits, the main visually distinguishable difference was that the engine was slightly raked back, to improve take off and landing characteristics. The early production R.E.8s were more or less identical to the prototypes.
The R.E.8 adopted a set of single bay, unequal span wings, identical to those of the earlier B.E.2e; although the span (and thus the wing area) had been increased slightly by the use of a wider upper centre section, and lower stub wings to match. On the B.E.2e, these wings functioned to maintain the stability of the B.E.2c while providing the aircraft with superior levels of manoeuvrability; although the long extensions on the upper wing gave rise to fears they would be prone to collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which in turn did not help to build trust in the aircraft. Several other features, such as the tailplane, were also identical to those previously used upon the B.E.2e.
For the purpose of making the R.E.8 less tiring to fly, the pilot&#x27;s controls included a wheel to adjust the tailplane incidence in flight and a primitive form of rudder trim (applied to the rudder bar) was provided to alleviate the constant pressure necessary to counteract the torque generated by the propeller. Basic flight controls were installed in the observer&#x27;s cockpit, which folded out of the way when not in use; these were connected to the elevators, rudder and throttle, but not to the ailerons, and were intended to give observers a chance to make a forced landing if the pilot was killed or incapacitated rather than to offer true dual control.

Although not so underpowered as the B.E.2, the R.E.8 was still handicapped by a less than adequate powerplant, and a model re-engined with the Hispano-Suiza engine was projected as the &quot;R.E.8a&quot; from quite an early stage. The cowling designed for the liquid-cooled engine closely resembled that of the B.E.12b or the S.E.5a. Supplies of Hispano-Suiza engines, more urgently required for other types, never permitted production of the R.E.8a, although a prototype was constructed and underwent trials during December 1916. Plans to mount Rolls-Royce aero engines, such as the Eagle or Falcon were also abortive, for similar reasons. These engines were in chronically short supply and reserved for various other types in British service, including the Airco DH.4 and the Bristol Fighter.

===Production===
During August 1916, production of an initial batch of 50 aircraft was commenced by the Royal Aircraft Factory itself. On 25 August, a contract was placed with Austin Motors for the completion of 100 R.E.8s; on 30 August, Siddeley-Deasy was also contracted to produce a further 100 examples. By September 1916, full-scale production was well under way. By the end of September, a further 850 R.E.8s had been ordered from a range of manufacturers. During December 1916, the first contractor-produced R.E.8s began to appear.

The Vickers-Challenger interrupter gear and the Scarff ring were still in short supply, being required for the Sopwith 1½ Strutter and other types; accordingly, a few early R.E.8s were built with a pillar mounting for the observer&#x27;s gun as an interim measure. An alternative to the pilot&#x27;s synchronised Vickers had been designed, consisting of a fixed Lewis gun with deflector plates fitted to the propeller, although this was never used, a Vickers gun for the pilot being mounted on the port side of the fuselage in a similar position to that on the B.E.12, at first synchronised by the Vickers-Challenger gear and then by the improved Constantinesco hydraulic gear. Photographs of this armament installation make it clear that the cocking handle of the Vickers gun was in easy reach of the pilot and that a normal Aldis sight was often mounted in the pilot&#x27;s windscreen, giving the lie to statements that the forward firing gun could not be sighted properly due to its position, although the lack of standisation complicated maintenance in operational squadrons.

In total, 4,077 R.E.8s were constructed; a further 353 aircraft that had been on order were cancelled following the end of the war. Only a handful of production aircraft were actually completed by the Royal Aircraft Factory; the bulk of the work was issued out to several private companies including Austin Motors, Daimler, Standard Motors, Siddeley-Deasy and the Coventry Ordnance Works, which were responsible for the type throughout its production life.

==Operational history==
The first production aircraft reached 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in France in November 1916. The inexperienced pilots of 52 Squadron found their new mounts thoroughly dangerous and several were killed spinning in off a stall while attempting to land; they were grateful to return to the B.E.2e by exchanging aircraft with 34 Squadron in January 1917. Experienced pilots had fewer problems with the new type and re-equipment of B.E.2 squadrons continued. Pilot&#x27;s notes for the R.E.8, prepared in the field, drew attention to the fact that it had a higher landing speed than the B.E.2e (hardly surprising, since it was heavier and had almost the same wing area) and that it gave almost no warning of a stall. This seems to have been the source of most complaints about the type&#x27;s &quot;trickiness&quot;.
The Royal Aircraft Factory conducted spinning tests on the type, concluding that the R.E.8 was quite hard to spin and recovered easily; but the fin was redesigned with slightly increased area to improve spin recovery. The modification resulted in the production version being no less stable than the B.E.2e; and while this was an advantage for artillery observation and photography it gave the R.E.8 little chance to out-manoeuvre enemy fighters. An even larger fin was fitted to some R.E.8s used as trainers. Some pilots flew the R.E.8 with an empty reserve fuel tank (or even filled the tank with fire extinguisher fluid) to avoid a perceived tendency of R.E.8s to burn on crashing. None of these measures would have made the aircraft any &quot;safer&quot;, if the problem was one of poor stalling characteristics. Several pilots who flew the type mentioned that they had no problems but were careful to keep the airspeed well above stalling point.
R.E.8s began to arrive at the front in numbers just as the period of German air superiority known as &quot;Bloody April&quot; was taking a heavy toll of all types in the RFC; and early service was not auspicious. On 13 April 1917, six R.E.8s from 59 Squadron were sent on a long range photo reconnaissance mission, missed their intended escorts, and were met by the picked fighter pilots of &quot;Jasta 11&quot;, who shot them all down within five minutes.

The casualty rate in R.E.8 squadrons became more sustainable as new Allied fighter types regained air superiority and pilot training and tactics improved. Although never a popular aeroplane, it was reasonably satisfactory for the tasks demanded of it and was even regarded with some affection, gaining the rhyming slang nickname &quot;Harry Tate&quot; (after a popular music hall artist of the time). Some crews flew their slow, cumbersome mounts quite aggressively; the German fighter ace Eduard Ritter von Dostler was shot down by an R.E.8 of 7 Squadron, while 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was credited with 50 air victories in 12 months of operations. Lts Pithey and Rhodes of 12 Squadron were the most successful R.E.8 crew in air-to-air combat, being credited with twelve victories.
Although supplemented by other types, the R.E.8 remained the standard RFC artillery observation, air photography and general short range reconnaissance aircraft for the remainder of the war, equipping 18 RFC squadrons in 1917 and 19 squadrons in 1918. Belgium was the only country other than Britain and the Dominions to operate the R.E.8 during the First World War, receiving 22 in July 1917. At least some of the Belgian examples were fitted with Hispano-Suiza engines, in a SPAD type cowling, rather than the S.E.5a type cowling of the R.E.8a.

It was hoped to be able to replace the R.E.8 with a version of the Bristol Fighter powered by the Sunbeam Arab engine but the combination proved unsuccessful and few &quot;Arab Bristols&quot; were ever built. A few R.E.8 squadrons were issued with one or two standard (Falcon engined) F.2bs in the last weeks of the war. By November 1918, the R.E.8 was regarded as totally obsolete and surviving examples were quickly retired after the Armistice. Nor was the type popular with the private owners who purchased surplus RAF aircraft after the war and no R.E.8s came onto the civil register.

==Variants==
;R.E.8
:Standard general purpose aircraft, powered by 140 hp (104 kW) RAF 4a engine.
;R.E.8a
:Conversion of one R.E.8 with 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine in a square, S.E.5 (or B.E.12b) type cowling. No production due to shortage of Hispano engines. At least some of the R.E.8s supplied to Belgium were also re-engined with Hispanos – in this case in a cowling resembling that of the later SPADs.
;R.E.9
:R.E.8 modified with equal-span wings similar to those of the B.E.2c/d and the larger fin and rudder fitted to some R.E.8s at training units. Two were converted in 1917, but they showed no advantage over the standard R.E.8 (climb and manoeuvrability were worse) and no production followed.
;Siddeley-Deasy R.T.1
:Development of R.E.8 with equal span biplane wings of a new design.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only two &quot;original&quot; R.E.8s survive from World War One.

The restoration of R.E.8 &quot;F3556&quot; at the Imperial War Museum Duxford was completed in 2004. This aircraft, built by Daimler, arrived in France on Armistice Day, still in its original packing case. It is currently displayed suspended from the roof of the AirSpace hangar at Duxford.

The other surviving R.E.8 is a former &quot;Aviation Militaire Belge&quot; machine preserved at the Brussels Air Museum. It is fitted with the usual Hispano-Suiza engine typical of R.E.8s in Belgian service, in the usual SPAD type cowling and circular frontal radiator.

The Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon has a full size replica R.E.8, which was built by The Vintage Aviator Ltd ( TVAL ) in New Zealand in 2011. It is fitted with a &quot;new build&quot; RAF 4a engine and was successfully test flown at Masterton, NZ, on 1 January 2012, with the registration ZK-TVC. Crated and shipped to England, it was reassembled at The Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden Airfield in June 2012 and undertook a number of flights painted as &#x27;A3930&#x27; of No. 9 Squadron Royal Flying Corps, before being sent by road to Hendon in November 2012. It is now on static display in the Grahame-White Factory.

The Royal Australian Air Force has an airworthy replica R.E.8, built in 2012 and painted in late WW1 era Australian Flying Corps livery. It was previously part of the RAAF Museum collection and as of 2021 is with the Air Force Heritage Squadron.

<doc id="1001374" wikidata="Q209009" url="?curid=1001374" title="Telavi">
<text>Telavi (; ) is the main city and administrative center of the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti. As of the 2017 Census, its population was 19,751. The city is located on the foothills of the Tsiv-Gombori Range at above sea level.

==History==
The first archaeological findings from Telavi date back to the Bronze Age. One of the earliest surviving accounts of Telavi is from the 2nd century AD, by Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus, who mentions the name &quot;Teleda&quot; (a reference to &quot;Telavi&quot;). Telavi began to transform into a fairly important and large political and administrative center in the 8th century. Interesting information on Telavi is provided in the records by an Arab geographer, Al-Muqaddasi of the 10th century, who mentions Telavi along with such important cities of that time&#x27;s Caucasus as Tbilisi, Shamkhor, Ganja, Shemakha and Shirvan. Speaking about the population of Telavi, Al-Muqaddasi points out that for the most part it consisted of Christians.
From the 10th to the 12th centuries, Telavi served as the capital of the Kingdom of Kakheti and later Kingdom of Kakhet-Hereti. During the Golden Era of the Georgian State (12th–13th centuries), Telavi turned into one of the most important political and economic centers of the Georgian State. After the disintegration of the united Georgian Kingdom in the 15th century, the role of Telavi started to decline and the city eventually became an ordinary town of trade and crafts. Telavi regained its political importance in the 17th century when it became a capital of the kingdom of Kakheti. By 1762, it turned into the second capital (after Tbilisi) of the united Eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti. The reign of King Erekle II, who was born and died in this city, was a special epoch in the history of Telavi. During this period from 1744 to 1798, it grew into a strategic and cultural centre. Erakle II established there a theological seminary and founded a theatre. Erekle II&#x27;s reforms touched upon all aspects of life in the country. They changed fundamentally the political, economical and cultural orientation of Kartli-Kakheti and, subsequently of the whole Georgia. His name became a symbol of freedom and national independence of the Georgian people. Erakle II is still called affectionately &quot;Patara Kakhi&quot; (&#x27;Little Kakhetian&#x27;), and his heroic deeds are described in folk literature.

===Russian rule===

In 1801, after the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti was annexed by the Russian Empire, Telavi lost its status as a capital. In the 19th century, the city was the administrative center of the Telavi uezd within the Tiflis Governorate. During that period, the economy of the city was mainly composed of small-scale industries (leather painting, pottery production, wine-making, etc.), commerce and agriculture. The town&#x27;s population was about 12,000 in the end of the 19th century (including about 9,000 Armenians and 2,000 ethnic Georgians).

==Heritage==
Telavi and its surroundings are rich in historical, architectural and natural monuments. The most important heritage monuments preserved within the city limits include:
* &quot;Dzveli Galavani&quot; (&#x27;Old Walls&#x27;) – fortress of the first Kakhetian kings (9th–10th centuries)
* Church of the St. Mary (16th century)
* Church of the Holy Trinity (6th century)
* Fortress &quot;Batonis Tsikhe&quot; (&#x27;Fortress of Master&#x27;) built in the 17th century; one of the only well-preserved medieval royal palaces in Georgia
* &quot;Korchibashishvilebis Tsikhe&quot; – castle of the local noblemen named Korchibashishvilis (16th–18th century)
* &quot;Akhvakhishvilebis Tsikhe&quot; – castle of the local noblemen named Vakhvakhishvilis (18th century)
Telavi is the only city in Georgia where four fortification monuments from four historical periods remain relatively intact. Due to this reason, architects, scholars and art historians consider Telavi as the most &quot;medieval&quot; city in the country. Another curious sight in Telavi is a 900-year-old plane tree which is high and around the trunk. Other notable landmarks around Telavi include the Alaverdi Cathedral (11th century), the second highest cathedral in Georgia after the newly built Tbilisi Sameba Cathedral; the Ikalto Academy (8th-12th centuries–), where the famous Georgian writer Shota Rustaveli studied; the Church of St. George (dedicated to the patron saint of Georgia, where it is said that there are 365 churches named St. George); ruins of the city and castle of Gremi (the former capital of Kakheti during the 15th–17th centuries); Shuamta, a complex made of three churches of different periods—6th, 7th and 8th centuries—in a highland forest; Akhali Shuamta (&#x27;New Shuamta&#x27;), the monastery close to Dzveli Shuamta (&#x27;Old Shuamta&#x27;), built in the 16th century; the stunning Tsinandali Gardens (the residential Palace of Noblemen Chavchavadzes family); and many others.

===Armenian heritage of Telavi===
The former Armenian population had a rich cultural life, some of which remains to this day, and some of which is lost.

* Avag (Mother) St. George Church – called in Armenian, located in the heart of the old city. The bell tower was built in 1829. In 1861 permission was requested to build a dome (gmbet) on the church. By early 1923 the church was closed, and the bell tower was demolished on April 19, 1924. In May of the same year the gavit was also demolished, along with the serf walls on the western and southern sides.
* Surb Karapet Church – built in 1797. By 1818 it was already not used anymore.
* Dzvelgalavani Surb Gevorg Church – date of construction is unknown, but there are records that it was already built between 1798 and 1800, and that it was renovated in 1852 at a cost of 1,500 manet. Still stands. In poor condition.
* Surb Astvatsatsin (&#x27;Holy Mother of God&#x27;). Located in the old Armenian cemetery. There are records of it already existing by 1840, which means it was built at some point prior. In 1879, 4000 rubles were spent to build a dome (&quot;gmbet&quot;) on the church. On the night of December 10, 1894, the church was robbed, leading to protective walls being built around it. Still stands, and functions as a Georgian Church now.
* Surb Yerordutyun Church. There are no known records about the construction, but there are records of it beginning in the 1800s. It was closed in 1923.
* Surb Tovmas Chapel. Built of wood from 1882 to 1885 at a cost of 280 rubles. Closed in 1923. Still stands.

==Geography==
Telavi faces the Tsiv-Gombori Range to the south and southwest and borders on the Alazani Valley to the north and east.

The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, which runs to the north of the Alazani Valley, can be seen from most of Telavi.

At present, the city of Telavi is connected with Tbilisi by two highways. 
The most widely traveled (and better-paved) highway runs through the rural areas of Kakheti and is longer (the overall length of the highway is approximately ) than the route, which runs through the highlands of the Gombori Mountain Range.

The shorter route (approximately ) is quite scenic, but is less used due to the reconstruction works that are being carried out there from 2014, but now it is used way. The road is a little difficult for non-professional and non-experienced drivers, as it is very narrow and dangerous.

Because of its beauty, historical monuments and hospitality and the reputation for kindness of its residents, the city is a popular tourist destination in Georgia.

Highest recorded temperature: on 31 July 2000.

Lowest recorded temperature: on 28 January 2016.

<text>The Gatineau River (, ) is a river in western Quebec, Canada, which rises in lakes north of the Baskatong Reservoir and flows south to join the Ottawa River at the city of Gatineau, Quebec. The river is long and drains an area of .

==Toponomy==
According to the &quot;&quot; (1895), the land-surveyor Noël Beaupré wrote an official report on the river on February 3, 1721, but without naming it, leaving it unclear if its current name was in use in the 18th century.

There are two hypotheses to explain the origin of the river&#x27;s name. It would be either of indigenous origin or of French origin:
# The name of the river and the city would come from the Anishinaabemowin (language of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg) Tenagatino Zibi, according to the elders of Kitigan Zibi.
# In his 1889 article published in the &quot;Echo de la Gatineau&quot;, Benjamin Sulte wrote: &quot;One hundred years ago, the Gatineau family was extinct, or thereabouts; it is hardly likely that we waited for its disappearance to consecrate the memory of the three or four fur traders it produced. The custom must have been established during the lifetime of these men, and because they traded in these places. Of the latter fact, for instance, I am not certain.&quot; In his own words, Sulte writes that he is creating a myth and that the story that the Gatineau family gave the river its name is a myth, invented by Sulte himself. According to Sulte, the name Gatineau comes from the Gastineau family - not Gatineau - one of its members, Nicolas Gastineau sieur Duplessis (1627-1689).

The toponym Lettinoe, Gateno, Gatteno and Gatineau appears:
* The name Lettinoe, in a report by a Lieutenant Jones in 1783;

== Geography ==
The geography of the area was altered with the construction of the Baskatong Reservoir, and it is still possible to travel upstream on the Gatineau and reach a point where a small portage leads to the headwaters of the Ottawa River. The Ottawa River then flows northwest and turns south where it eventually flows more easterly and connects with the Gatineau.

The river flows through the communities of:
* Maniwaki
* Gracefield
* Low
* Wakefield
* Chelsea
* Cantley
* Gatineau

A covered wooden bridge over the river at Wakefield, built in 1915, was destroyed by arson in 1984, but has been rebuilt.

==History==
=== Exploration ===

This river was an important transportation corridor for native people of the region and early explorers. On June 4, 1613, Samuel de Champlain passed here while travelling on the Ottawa River to L&#x27;Isle-aux-Allumettes. He noted this &quot;river coming from the north&quot; but did not give its name.

=== Economic uses ===
From the 19th century until 1991, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills near the mouth of the river. Philemon Wright and his descendants played an important role in the development of the lumber industry in the Gatineau valley. In more recent times, with declining quality in the forests of the region, logs were used for pulp and paper.

The river has been extensively dammed and is an important source of hydroelectric power. In 1925, three hydroelectric dams were constructed along the lower Gatineau River, making them one of the biggest economic and industrial projects in the region&#x27;s history. These are now known today as the Paugan, Chelsea and Rapides-Farmers Hydroelectric Stations (Centrale Paugan, Centrale Chelsea and Centrale Rapides-Farmers). The stations are located within the municipalities of Low, Cantley and Gatineau.

The Hull–Chelsea–Wakefield Railway, a tourist steam train, followed a route up the Gatineau valley to Wakefield.
In 1915, Canadian artist and member of the Group of Seven J. E. H. MacDonald would depict logging operations on the river is his painting, &quot;Logs on the Gatineau&quot;.

=== Flooding ===
In the spring of 1974, there was extensive flooding along the Gatineau.

<text>Crooked Island is an island and district, part of a group of Bahamian islands defining a large, shallow lagoon called the Bight of Acklins, of which the largest are Crooked Island in the north and Acklins in the south-east, and the smaller are Long Cay (once known as Fortune Island) in the north-west, and Castle Island in the south.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the island &quot;Jumento&quot;, meaning &quot;upper land of the middle distance&quot;. Meanwhile, the Spaniard explorers had named the island &quot;Isabella&quot;.

==History==
The islands were settled by American Loyalists in the late 1780s who set cotton plantations using over 1,000 slaves. After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire these became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming.

It is believed that the first Post Office in the Bahamas was at Pitts Town on Crooked Island.

==Population==
The main town in the group is Colonel Hill (pop. 51) on Crooked Island.

The population of Crooked Island was 330 at the 2010 census.

==Transportation==
The island is served by Colonel Hill Airport.

== Politics ==
The island is part of the MICAL constituency for elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas.

<doc id="1001393" wikidata="Q3084080" url="?curid=1001393" title="Butterfly Bomb">
<text>The Butterfly Bomb (or Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2 kg or SD 2) was a German anti-personnel submunition (or &quot;bomblet&quot;) used by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. It was so named because the thin cylindrical metal outer shell which hinged open when the bomblet deployed gave it the superficial appearance of a large butterfly. The design was very distinctive and easy to recognise. SD 2 bomblets were not dropped individually, but were packed into containers holding between 6 and 108 submunitions e.g. the AB 23 SD 2 and AB 250-3 submunition dispensers. The SD 2 submunitions were released after the container was released from the aircraft and had burst open. Because SD 2s were always dropped in groups (never individually) the discovery of one unexploded SD 2 was a reliable indication that others had been dropped nearby. This bomb type was one of the first cluster bombs ever used in combat and it proved to be a highly effective weapon. The bomb containers that carried the SD 2 bomblets and released them in the air were nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Eggs&quot; by Luftwaffe air and ground crew.

==Description==
The SD 2 submunition was a long cylinder of cast iron, which was slightly larger in diameter before its wings deployed. A steel cable long was attached via a spindle to an aluminium fuze screwed into the fuze pocket in the side of the bomblet. The outer shell was hinged and would flip open as two half-cylinders when it was dropped. Additionally, spring-loaded wings at the ends would flip out. The wings at the end were canted at an angle to the airflow, which turned the spindle (connected to the fuze) counterclockwise as the bomblet fell. After the spindle had revolved approximately 10 times (partially unscrewing itself from the bomb) it released a spring-loaded pin inside the fuze, which fully armed the SD 2 bomb. The wings and arming spindle remained attached to the bomb after the fuze had armed itself, as the bomb descended towards the ground. Butterfly bombs contained the kleine Zündladung 34 (kl. Zdlg. 34/Np with a blasting cap and 7 grams of Nitropenta) booster and the main explosive filling consisting of 225 grams of cast Füllpulver 60/40 (Amatol) explosive. The fragmentation density produced by an SD 2 was 1 fragment per m2 in 8 meters radius from a ground burst SD 2 bomb; overall, the body of an SD 2 produced about 250 fragments with a mass of over 1 gram and a still greater number of lighter fragments. The fragments were generally lethal to anyone within a radius of and could inflict serious fragmentation injuries (e.g. deep penetrating eye wounds) as far away as . Butterfly bombs were usually painted either straw yellow (desert camouflage), or, if fitted with the DoppZ (41) or (41) A fuze, dark green or grey.

Butterfly bombs could be fitted with any one of three fuzes, which were made of aluminium and stamped with the model type surrounded by a circle:

* 41 fuze – has an external selector switch with two settings. The &quot;Zeit&quot; (time) setting will detonate the bomb in the air, approximately 5 seconds after being armed. The &quot;AZ&quot; (Aufschlagzünder - impact) setting triggers detonation when the bomb hits the ground. The fuze is armed if 4 screw threads at the base of the arming spindle are visible. This fuze is highly sensitive to disturbance if the selector switch is set to &quot;Zeit&quot; and the bomb is unexploded. The particular switch setting of any type 41 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior.
* 67 fuze – clockwork time delay. Time of detonation can be set between 5 and 30 minutes after arming itself in the air. This fuze also has an external selector switch for impact detonation. The particular switch setting of any type 67 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior.
* 70 fuze – anti-handling device (i.e. booby trap) will trigger detonation if the bomb is moved after impact with the ground. The fuze is armed if 3 screw threads at the base of the arming spindle are visible.

Butterfly bombs in a submunitions container could have a mixture of different fuzes fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single fuze type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible fuze settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. Fuze variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the fuze pocket via a bayonet fitting (the fuze was held in place via two steel clips) but otherwise functioned identically.

As with more modern cluster bombs, it was not considered practical to disarm butterfly bombs which had fully armed themselves but failed to detonate. This was because SD 2 fuzes were deliberately designed to be extremely difficult and dangerous to render safe once they had armed themselves. Instead, the standard render safe procedure for any unexploded SD 2 butterfly bomb was to evacuate the area for at least 30 minutes (in case the bomblet was fitted with a type 67 time delay fuze), then surround it with a ring of sandbags (to contain the explosion) and destroy it &quot;in situ&quot; by detonating a small explosive charge beside it. Other solutions were to attach a long string to the bomb and tug on it after taking cover, or for bombs in open countryside, shooting at them with a rifle from a safe distance.

Not all unexploded SD 2 butterfly bombs still have their wings attached. In some cases the wings have rusted away and fallen off. The SD 2 then resembles a rusty tin can with an aluminium disc (the fuze) in its side, sometimes with a short stub projecting from it. Regardless of age and condition, all unexploded SD 2s remain highly sensitive to disturbance and can easily detonate.

==Use==
Butterfly bombs were first used against Ipswich in 1940, but were also dropped on Kingston upon Hull, Grimsby and Cleethorpes in June 1943, amongst various other targets in the United Kingdom. Lieutenant Colonel Eric Wakeling led the clearance of the unexploded ordnance in Grimsby within the Royal Engineers. They were subsequently used against Allied forces in the Middle East. The British Government deliberately suppressed news of the damage and disruption caused by butterfly bombs in order to avoid encouraging continued use by the Germans. On October 28, 1940, some butterfly bombs that had failed to arm themselves properly were discovered in Ipswich by British Army ordnance technicians Sergeant Cann and 2nd Lieutenant Taylor. By screwing the arming rods back into the fuzes (i.e. the unarmed position) they were able to recover safe examples of the new weapon system to allow the British to reverse-engineer and understand the mechanism.

The SD 2 saw use in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union which began on 22 June 1941. Twenty to thirty aircrews had been picked to drop SD 2s and SD10s (10 kg submunitions) on key Soviet airfields, a flight of three aircraft being assigned to each field. The purpose of these early attacks was to cause disruption and confusion as well as to preclude dispersion of Soviet planes until the main attack was launched. It was reported that Kampfgeschwader 51 lost 15 aircraft due to accidents with the SD 2s - nearly half of the total Luftwaffe losses that day.

Luftwaffe monthly consumption of the SD 2 increased from 289,000 examples in the summer of 1941 to 436,000 in July 1943 and 520,000 in August 1943. This increase was nowhere near high enough to match the Luftwaffe senior leadership&#x27;s demands.

The AB 250-2 cluster bomb could carry 144 SD 2 anti-personnel submunitions, or 40 of the anti-armor SD-4 submunitions. While the AB 250-3 could carry 108 SD 2s. AB 250s were most frequently carried by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 F/G series, but in practice, they could be lifted by a wide variety of aircraft, including the Me 262. Because of Hitler&#x27;s interference, these jet-powered fighters were pressed into service as a Jabo (JagdBomber, fighter-bomber), a role for which they were poorly suited. Notably, Me 262s were sent on nuisance raids against Eindhoven in early October, loaded with AB 250 bomblet dispensers.

The last recorded UK death from a German butterfly bomb in England occurred on November 27, 1956, over 11 years after the end of the war: Flight Lieutenant Herbert Derrington of the RAF was examining an SD 2 at the &quot;Upminster bomb cemetery&quot; (some remote sandpits situated East of RAF Hornchurch, where explosive ordnance disposal experimental and research work took place) when it detonated. He died of shrapnel and blast injuries at Oldchurch Hospital the same day.

On the island of Malta in 1981 Paul Gauci, a 41-year-old Maltese man, died after welding a butterfly bomb to a metal pipe and using it as a mallet, thinking it was a harmless can. The latest find of such a bomb was on 28 October 2009, by an 11-year-old boy in a secluded valley close to a heavily bombarded airfield. This bomb was safely detonated on-site by the Armed Forces of Malta.

==US copy==
The United States manufactured a copy of the SD 2 for use during World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War, designating it the M83 submunition. The 3 fuze types used on the M83 submunition were slightly modified versions of the original German designs:

* M128A1 - airburst or impact fuze. Airburst detonation occurred 2.5 seconds after arming. Detonation on impact was instantaneous. The fuze setting is clearly marked on the exterior and was selectable by ground crew
* M130A1 - clockwork time fuze with time delays ranging from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 minutes. Has no markings, but is recognisable by the square-shaped fitting for the arming spindle
* M131A1 - anti-disturbance fuze. Detonation triggered when the device was disturbed. Has no markings, but is recognisable by the pentagonal-shaped fitting for the arming spindle

The M83 fragmentation bomblet was used in the US M28 and M29 cluster bombs.

<text>Matalascañas (; [matalaʰ&#x27;kaɲa]) is the name of an Atlantic beach and resort within the Municipality of Almonte, in southwestern Spain. It is known for having an ancient upside down tower on the sand
called &quot;Torre de la Higuera&quot;, one of the seven defensive towers built by Phillip II in the 16th century to protect the coast from incursions by Turkish and North African corsairs and which is protected as a Cultural Interest Asset by the government. This beach is part of the coast of Almonte, which is the longest beach in Spain, being around 30 miles long (53 km) and including several other landmarks like Torre del Loro&#x27;s Beach, Cuesta Maneli Beach and the virgin beaches of the Doñana National Park, ending at river Guadalquivir. This locale was still called by the tower&#x27;s name until the 1970s. 
Matalascañas is surrounded by the Doñana National Park and was segregated from it in 1969 to allow the development of a beach-side tourist village. The mild Mediterranean climate, fine golden sand of the beachfront, mobile dunes and clean water attract tourists throughout the year and the summer nightlife is attractive to young people. Officially established in 1972, its population goes into orbit during the summer, due to its proximity to Seville and being a holiday destination for neighbouring towns and a final residence for retired people. It&#x27;s been holding the title of Blue flag beach for decades.

== History ==

Almonte purchased the eastern Atlantic coast of Huelva in 1583, several centuries before the Doñana National Park was established. Local farming and fishing business then started in the area. In 1924, German archaeologist Adolf Schulten visited the area in his quest to find Atlantis and, despite finally giving up, he came across several Roman ruins, including a garum factory from the 3th century AD. It&#x27;s an evidence of the fishing industry in the area back then. During the 40s, eucalyptus were planted as part of the wood and paper industry plan and many river courses were altered. The 2nd Marquis of Bonanza sold a great part of this area to businessman Salvador Noguera and to the 3rd Marquis of Mérito. By 1962, they had founded the company &quot;Coto de Doñana, S.A.&quot;, which sold a 7-kilometer long strip of coast (4.35 miles) to company &quot;Hirta, S.A.&quot;, both involved in the winegrowing industry of Jerez de la Frontera.

By the mid 60s, several fishing huts had been installed along the coast, nearby the ruins of the tower, most of them made of bulrush, a traditional material in the area Road A-483 was finished by 1965 and would become later a turn-off of the popular motorway A-49 to connect Almonte to Huelva and Seville. In 1966 a new project to urbanise the coast, which was declared &quot;National Touristic Centre&quot; two years later. The National Park was established in 1969, delimiting the area available for the future resort.

The first brick was laid that same year and &quot;El Delfín&quot; (The Dolphin) was the first luxury building in the area, with private investment from estate agency &quot;Costa de la Luz&quot; and company &quot;Playas del Coto de Doñana, S.A.&quot;. A year later the first parish, the &quot;Flamero&quot; hotel and &quot;La Prensa&quot;, another residential building, were opened. In a few years, private investment skyrocketed beyond €9 million (a quantity unheard of at the time). Phone wires between Almonte and the new coastal resort were installed and the works on highway A-49 were speeded up to connect to local road A-483 and establish a faster way from Seville.

By the summer of 1971, Matalascañas had already become a national touristic destination, holding music festivals and all kind of contests (photography, literature, beauty, sailing and fishing) soon became usual, even attracting celebrities and socialites, including the royal family. Both its unique climate and its status as a resort embedded within Europe&#x27;s greatest natural reserve, soon made international tourism turn up and Hollywood took notice of the unique landscapes to start shooting several films, like The Wind and the Lion

Two years later, an average of 180,000 tourists were visiting Matalascañas in the summer, many of them affluent foreigners and socialites, with charter flights and horse carriages becoming a matter of course in those days. That same year the first fishing club opened, later becoming the Nautical and Fishing Club of Matalascañas and international stars such as Julio Iglesias performed in town. This glamorous exclusivity and unrestrained joy would soon come to an end when the council of Almonte, along with the regional and national government pushed legislation to take over the urban impact on the national park in 1988.

In 1990, the works for the biggest hotel in Almonte began, an imposing L-shaped building called &quot;Gran Hotel El Coto&quot;, just at the very end of the urban area, limiting with the national park. In 1993 Matalascañas was awarded its first Blue Flag, in recognition of its quality and eco-friendly services. In 1998, the works for the first green golf course in Europe began, finishing two years later. With 18 holes and 290,000m2, the golf course opened in year 2000 and caused great expectations.

In 2002, around 130 hectares of the coast east from the urban area were protected under a special status, becoming the &quot;Parque Dunar&quot; (Dune park). Its name refers to the high fossil dunes formed all along the coast of Almonte and far beyond the ruins of the Torre del Oro (Gold River Tower). A 100-meter high dune cliff can be found at &quot;El Asperillo&quot;, being the highest dune cliff in Europe, declared a &quot;Natural Monument of Andalusia&quot;. With an investment of more than €20 million, the &quot;Parque Dunar&quot; became a walkable attraction in which several important landmarks were installed, such as the sea museum &quot;Museo del Mundo Marino&quot;, a research centre, a horse riding club, a camel riding club, a beach restaurant, a nautical club, a lighthouse and several other buildings.

In 2021, several tracks belonging to extinct ungulate animals and neanderthal humans were found on the clay substratum that got uncovered during the low tide at the shore. They date back from 100,000 BC. The environmental association from the &quot;Parque Dunar&quot; organises free guided tours that include historical and geological commentaries and a voluntary litter collection. A recent research published by Quaternary Science Reviews and carried out by the University of Huelva confirmed that the humanoid footprints belong to Neanderthals.

Matalascañas still remains as an international holiday paradise with a local population of around 3,000 people, which boosts up to roughly 150,000 people during the summer. It currently offers around 100 restaurants, 10 hotels, 7 lifeguard stations, 9 public restrooms, public bus lines, taxi lines and touristic local trains. It&#x27;s been awarded blue flags and Q and SICTED certificates for touristic quality

== Physical location ==

=== Urban resort ===

The town of Matalascañas is a 4-km long strip along the coast of Almonte, halfway between the ruins of Torre del Oro and river Guadalquivir. It is one kilometer wide and is delimited from the Doñana National Park by the fenced north road which stretches the whole strip from east to west. That north road starts with a big roundabout decorated with trees, deer sculptures and the name of the town and provides access to the different districts (in Spanish, &quot;sectores&quot;) through 8 different roundabouts, all of them with a monument on top representing different local and regional customs. These are, from west to east: the Earth, the Dolmens, the Ship, the Dolphins, the Windows, the Tower and the Winery. There&#x27;s a main avenue with wide pavements and many businesses from the main roundabout towards the ruins of Torre de la Higuera called &quot;Avenida de las Adelfas&quot; (oleander avenue). The town is separated from the shore by a 2.5-mile pedestrian promenade (4 km long).

The town is divided into 27 districts named after different local terms related to nature and arranged alphabetically from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;T&#x27;. 6 of these districts, namely K, O, P, Q, R and S make up the popular area known as &quot;Caño Guerrero&quot; (warrior stream), which has the highest population density and most businesses. The eastern area of town, built more recently, is organised in seven different districts named from “a” to “g” (in lower case, to tell them apart from the capital letter ones). Here are the different districts with detailed information:

=== Natural environment ===
The physical geography of the area involves semi-fossil dunes a few metters high, whose altitude gradually increases as you move west from town until reaching 100 meters at &quot;El Asperillo&quot;, declared an Andalusian Natural Monument and the highest dune cliff in Europe. The shore is made of fine grain light golden sand and vegetation is scarce, being abundant only from the top of the dunes inwards. The climate is temperate, with warm and fresh summers and cool winters, combining both mediterranean and atlantic influences. Hottest month is August, with an average high of 26 °C(78F) and coldest month is January, with average ow of 12.5 °C (55F). This makes Almonte&#x27;s coast a global climatic paradise These are some of the most common plants and animals found in the surrounding areas of the Doñana National Park:

==== Flora ====
* Strawberry Tree
* Grey-leaved Cistus
* Stone Pine
* Juniper
* Sictus tree
* Marram Grass
* Crowberry

* Garden Warbler
* European rabbit


== Government and politics ==
Along with the worldwide-known village of El Rocío, Matalascañas is administered by the council of Almonte, which has permanent headquarters in district L, just next to the golf course and the police station, so the neighbours don&#x27;t have to move to the main town up north to meet some of their basic administrative needs. Matalascañas’ location inside the heart of the national park has brought about concerns and controversies for several decades regarding noise and light pollution, water management, roadkills and littering. A balance between Almonte&#x27;s economic and industrial development and the sustainable and green conservation of its natural environment has been the historical goal of locals since the establishment of the park in the late 60s. From May to September, when the floating population of the municipality skyrockets up to 200,000 people in summer and more than 1 million during the Pilgrimage of El Rocío, The local government has to implement different programmes which often involves coordination at a European level. Security, waste management and cleaning, pavement and road maintenance and traffic are some examples of the challenges the local government has to face. As for water consumption, it&#x27;s been proven that dryness in the area is rather related to northern watering crops than to the coastal resort itself. The council of Almonte is working along with the Ministry for the Environment on a project to switch the current water supply network from the aquifer to another one which comes from the eastern part of the province and, at the same time, placing a new wastewater treatment plant nearby the village of El Rocío, to avoid further pouring into the sea. Another challenging issue in town is traffic, specially during the summer. Both circulating and parking across town may be a problem due to summer population peaks, along with road clogging at summer weekends and asphalt and pavement damage. Parking regulation has been proposed by the council to help solve this problem, with a €40 million contract with a private company in 2025. The company will provide the parking meters, hire locals and paint the different signs and will also be in charge of restoring the asphalt of the whole town in advance and maintain it for the next 30 years. More than €6 million have been invested in 2024 regarding litter collection, hiring more than 80 locals and with a new company hired to work at the 3 urban areas at once (Almonte, El Rocío and Matalascañas itself). The recycling centre is operating and litter collection is specially reinforced during the summer, with special vehicles patrolling the seaside promenade and helping beach restaurants unload their packaging waste. Finally, the maintenance of the beach and the promenade comes at a high cost for the local, regional and national governments. In order to cope with winter sea storm damage on the shore, millions of euros are spent annually on sand and pavement restoration, with an investment of €6 million in restoring 700,000m3 (24 million ft3) of sand in 2024.

== Transport ==
Its unique location inside the Doñana National Park, the biggest natural reserve in Europe, has limited the urban expansion of the resort, as well as the different ways of access. There are three main ways to reach the town:

=== Road A-483 ===
This road goes up north and connects to the main town of Almonte, first bypassing the worldwide-known village of El Rocío (a stretch in which it becomes a highway) and eventually merging into A-49, one of the main highways that connects Spain to Portugal. This road also provides access to headquarters of the local agricultural companies and industrial estate &quot;Matalagrana&quot;, one of the main ones in southwestern Spain. It&#x27;s also used to get to the neoclassical Palace of &quot;El Acebrón&quot;.

=== Road A-494 ===
It goes west parallel to the coast and connects to Huelva. There&#x27;s an 18-mile cycle lane parallel to this road that connects to neighbour town of Mazagón, allowing pedestrian access to different landmarks of the coast of Almonte, like Heidy Beach (a dog friendly beach), Cuesta Maneli Beach, Torre del Oro Beach and the rocket launching platform &quot;Campo de Tiro del Médano del Oro&quot;.

=== Ferry ===
There&#x27;s also a regular ferry line that crosses river Guadalquivir, from Almonte to Cádiz. It sets sail from &quot;El Poblado de la Plancha&quot; and arrives at Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Private sailing is also available from the 4 different nautical clubs in town.

== Science, culture and historical heritage ==
The coast of Almonte has a temperate climate that allows a wide variety of scientific, sportive and cultural events to take place in Matalascañas and nearby coastal areas. While sportive and cultural events are almost exclusively funded by the town council along with local businesses, scientific ones are often carried out either at a national or European level, for they often concern national security or the preservation of the Doñana National Park.

=== Aerospace technology ===
In the 60s, the government installed a military training and rocket launching base on the west coast, near the medieval ruins of Torre del Loro. The unique climate of the coast, with storms and other extreme events rarely happening, has made it a perfect spot for military and spacecraft manoeuvres. Soldiers from many countries train there and the rocket platform allowed the launch of Miura 1, the first recoverable launch vehicle in Europe, which was carried out at 2am on Saturday, October 7, 2023. The base is currently administered by the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology. NASA has also provided high-tech radar technology and there are both European and American scientists working in there. A rising local interest in astrophysics led to the opening of an astronomical observatory in 2010, inaugurated by CSIC&#x27;s astrophysicist and cosmologist Juan P. Mercader. It&#x27;s located in Almonte, behind the CIECEMA (International Centre for Environmental Studies), in the north part of town. Many scientific organisations and amateur groups gather around the Matalascañas&#x27;s lighthouse to observe lunar eclipses, for the area has little light pollution and the sky is clear at night. Almonte also organises an event called “Ciencia al Fresquito”, held at night in the summer at park &quot;Clara Campoamor&quot;, which is rather elevated. Anyone can use several telescopes to observe the night sky at this event.

Typical food from Almonte include fish and seafood, which can be found in different restaurants of the main town itself and also in El Rocío and Matalascañas, specially at beachfront restaurants. &quot;Gamba blanca de Huelva&quot; (Huelva&#x27;s white prawn), &quot;coquinas&quot; (clams), &quot;chocos&quot; (cuttles), sardines, &quot;ortiguillas&quot; (snakelocks), seabass, seabream, atlantic pomfret or black paella are the most typical fresh dishes that can be ordered in the area. The first two species, namely white prawns and coquinas, are native to the area and can&#x27;t be found in neighbouring areas like Portugal or Cádiz. Furthermore, the so-called &quot;langostino de Sanlúcar&quot; (Sanlúcar&#x27;s prawn) is actually captured in the coast of Almonte. There are more than 100 restaurants in the coastal town, including grill houses, pizzerias and Italian, Japanese and Mexican restaurants. Beachfront restaurants and the ones at the main square are typically the oldest and long-running ones.

==== Museum ====
Located inside the &quot;Parque dunar&quot;, the &quot;Museo del Mundo Marino&quot; (Sea museum) was a scientific and historical complex opened in 2002, with an investment of €6 million, being one of the two museums in Spain to be certified with ISO 9001 and 14001 and AENOR. It had six main rooms and included the only complete orca skeleton in Europe, 17 real-scale mockups, 12 other skeletons of whales and other sea animals hanging down the roof and the biggest collection of shells and molluscs in Spain. The main attraction was a self-sustained spherical sealed ecosystem designed by NASA And branded Ecosphere, of which only one more replica was available at that time. It was designed for space flight and contains different species of shrimps, algae and bacteria. Different souvenir replicas were sold at the museum shop and more than 30,000 visitors got to know the centre each year. After the elections of 2011, when mayor Francisco Bella left after 20 years in charge, a coalition was formed by right-wing PP and left-wing IU. The latter, at a regional level, sanctioned the two councillors who made it possible for PP to govern Almonte. In January 2012, the museum owed its private stockholders more than €187,000 and the regional government (Junta de Andalucía) was providing a grant which would help solve the financial crisis, but 25% of that money was to arrive yet. The new local council decided to close the museum without receiving the rest of the grant and all the content of the centre was taken to Seville. In 2023, after former mayor Francisco Bella had been reelected, the new local council announced the reopening of the museum, which would start by turning the former building into a centre for digital resources.

==== Cinema and theatre ====
As for film services, there&#x27;s a 2-screen outdoor cinema in northwestern district D, next to the supermarket, called &quot;Cine Doñana&quot;. The local council has been projecting films at the beach during the summer for many years, specially in crowded areas nearby the beachfront restaurants. Regarding filming, the surrounding coastal areas have been used as set for multiple awarded films, such as The Neverending Story or Lawrence of Arabia, shot in the nearby dunes dunes of Doñana. For more details, visit the main article film section. 
The theatre is located at the tourist office&quot;Balcón del Atlántico&quot;, in district &quot;Parque Dunar&quot; and it&#x27;s an outdoor area consisting of a stage with several seating rows both in front and behind the stage, at an upper level. Several plays, concerts and other activities take place in the theatre every summer.

==== Horse and camel riding ====
At the very beginning of town, in the western area, there are three different local businesses involved in animal activities, horse riding clubs &quot;El Pasodoble&quot; And horse riding school &quot;Amigos del Caballo&quot;. The first one organises horse riding routes at several levels and the latter provides horse riding lessons and includes a 2,200m2 arena which hosts international championships and contests. Environmental association &quot;Aires Africanos&quot; Owns a big farm with several camels, llamas and horses. It organises camel riding routes around the area and also provides lessons. They also sell handmade camel milk soap.

==== National park visits ====
There are many ways to visit the Doñana National Park, both using public and private services. Most public visits are organised by the council of Almonte and often involve groups of specific visitors (elderly, students, etc.). Within the private sector, guided visits by all-terrain minibuses can be booked at the visitor&#x27;s centre &quot;El Acebuche&quot;, 6.5 km north from town. The best period to visit the park goes from December to June, specially Spring, when temperatures are optimal and the park is at its greenest and wettest. Official private visits often start at &quot;El Acebuche&quot; and access the park through Matalascañas. Main landmarks inside the park include: tha marsh of El Rocío, the meadows, the woods, official residence Palacio de Las Marismillas, the dunes, the beach and visitor&#x27;s recreative area &quot;Poblado de la Plancha&quot;. Several modalities are available, from quick visits a few hours long to full-day experiences including lunch in Sanlúcar, crossing river Guadalquivir.

==== Heritage ====
Three main historical landmarks can be found in Matalascañas or its surroundings, but as the main section about heritage of the municipality describes, more than 20 different historical landmarks are spread through Almonte&#x27;s territory. Some of them are in ruins and other are in good conditions and even in use.

* Holocene fossil footprints
Once Heidi Beach is left behind heading west, several extinct ungulate&#x27;s tracks can be found on the clay substratum that lies beneath the sand. They date back from 100,000 BC and include wolf, aurochs, palaeoloxodon, red deer, wild boar, wader and anatidae. They can be observed only when the tide is low and the sand moves back. There is an environmental association called “Parque Dunar”, which organises free guided tours that include historical and geological commentaries and a voluntary litter collection. In a recent research published by Quaternary Science Reviews and carried out by the University of Huelva, it has been confirmed that the humanoid footprints belong to Neanderthals.

* Fortified towers 
King Philip II of Spain ordered the construction of a series of watchtowers during the 16th century to prevent Northern African invasions from the sea, given the multiple wars that Spain was waging at that moment. At least six of these towers are located within Almonte&#x27;s territory. These are, from east to west: Torre del Oro (Tower of the Golden River), Torre del Asperillo, Torre de la Higuera (Tower of the Fig tree), Torre Carbonero (Charcoal Tower), Torre Zalabar and Torre San Jacinto (St J&#x27;s Tower). All of them are declared Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Interest Asset), a protected cultural status in Spain. The first three towers are in ruins, while the last three can be observed as they originally were. Torre de la Higuera is the only one of the towers located within the Matalascañas Beach, at the beginning of town and has become a symbol for Almonte, often appearing in postcards and other touristic elements.

* World War II bunkers 
There are several bunkers from World War II in the shore next to the delta of river Guadalquivir, in different coastal points. An activity called “Descubre tus fortalezas” (literally “Discover your fortresses”) carries out guided tours to these remains, with historians, architects and archaeologists participating. The bunkers were built by order of Franco in 1943 in fear of being invaded by the allied troops during the North African campaign. Another way of sightseeing the bunkers is booking a guided visit to the park, but it doesn&#x27;t include walking in this zone.

=== Sports ===
Almonte, like other coastal municipalities of southern Spain, enjoys a stable temperate weather that has made it possible to boost outdoor sport activities. Both the council and private investment have sport promotion as a priority, mainly fishing, horse and camel riding, golf, sailing, paragliding, cycling, volleyball and running.

==== Sailing, fishing and paragliding ====
There are four nautical clubs in Matalascañas. The main one started as a fishing local club opened in the 70s, later becoming the first nautical club. It&#x27;s located less than 1 km west from town and can be accessed by car using the first roundabout in road A-494, as you exit the main roundabout at the entrance of Matalascañas. It stores up to 140 boats on land, being towed down the dune to the sea for sailing, using a delimited area where only sailing is allowed. Next to the club there&#x27;s a restaurant. Once the nautical buoys are left behind and heading west, Heidi&#x27;s Beach can be found. It&#x27;s one of the most liberal beaches in Southern Spain, being LGBT-friendly, dog-friendly and having nude zones. Heading east, opposite the dog beach, there&#x27;s a restaurant on top of the dune called Bananas and next to it an area used for paragliding, taking advantage of the dune cliff. Another sailing club is &quot;Torre Almenara&quot;, in district N, on the shore, with smaller boats and kayaks. Fishing clubs and shops, watercrafts, paddle boats, floating bouncy castles, windsurf and amateur fishing are usual as well all along town.

==== Golf ====
In 1998, the works began for the first green golf course in Europe, meeting eco-friendly standards. With year-round golf season, Bermuda fairways, 18 holes and 290,000m2, it opened in 2000 As &quot;Dunas de Doñana Golf&quot;. The local government, led by Francisco Bella and company Sierra Clara provided funding, with design by Fernando Menaya. The most innovative aspect that makes it unique is its system of watering with recycled water. In 2009, the council of Almonte acquired the rest of the golf course for €7.5 million, getting full ownership and rented it to a new leaseholder, &quot;Doñana De Silva Golf&quot;. It was closed in 2016 due to disagreemets between the new leaseholder and the new elected local government regarding the quality of watering. It held all kind of regional, national and international contests and championships, including the &quot;Campeonato de España de Profesionales&quot; (Spanish Professional Championship). In 2017, the Supreme Court of Spain ruled in favour of the purchase of the course in 2009 by the council. In 2023, former mayor Francisco Bella was reelected and announced a reopening of the golf course in the following years.

==== Kart racing, cycling and jogging ====
There&#x27;s a 3,400m2 karting circuit with 9 curves, located in district L, next to the north road and the police headquarters. It has also a 900m2 paddock area next to the circuit. Borth karting and motocross are popular sports in Almonte. As for biking, there&#x27;s an 18-mile cycle lane (30 km) parallel to the north road all alog town and continuing towards the neighbouring town of Mazagón, to the west. It allows access to different beaches of Almonte&#x27;s coast both walking and by bike (Heidi Beach, Cuesta Maneli Beach and Torre del Oro Beach. Cycling tourism is also practised, with companies like &quot;Doñanatour&quot; Or eco-friendly group &quot;Doñabike&quot;, promoting electric bikes Championships like &quot;Doñana Natural&quot;, which started in 2012 are also popular in the area, including routes across the natural park. Finally, jogging and hiking need to be mentioned as the most popular outdoor activity in the area, taking advantage of the vast shores, the beachfront promenade, the pedestrian path parallel to the north road and the different official routes inside the heart of Doñana. Different marathons are held every year, the most popular one being the 9-mile &quot;Carrera Nocturna&quot; (Night Race) sponsored by local sport club &quot;Espartanos&quot;and carried out at the beach since 2013.

==== Volleyball and beach paddle ====
Beach volleyball has been for decades the most popular group sport at the beach. It&#x27;s practised both at an official level and by amateur groups, though only the first modality is officially allowed. There&#x27;s an annual regional championship normally held in Matalascañas. In 2024, more than 200 teams from all over the province participated in the &quot;XXVI Circuito Provincial&quot; (regional championship), spending more than 12 hours playing in 4 different categories. Beach paddle is exclusively practised at non-professional levels by locals and tourists, but is still a widespread sport activity.

<doc id="1001410" wikidata="Q2533304" url="?curid=1001410" title="Vendetta (1991 video game)">
<text>Vendetta, known in Japan as , is a 1991 side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up arcade game developed and published by Konami. It is a sequel to 1989 Konami&#x27;s &quot;Crime Fighters&quot;, although it was marketed internationally as a stand-alone game with no previous connections.

The gameplay involves the four members of the hero gang, The Cobras, fighting enemies to rescue a kidnapped member, Kate. The game uses &#x27;punch&#x27; and &#x27;kick&#x27; buttons and allows the use of various weapons, with the score based on opponents eliminated. The plot centers around The Cobras&#x27; attempt to save their fellow gang member Kate from the &quot;Dead End&quot; gang, who control Dead End City. Vendetta was censored in some countries to remove certain enemy characters. The game received positive reviews for its atmosphere and gameplay, and was included in the Top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list by Time Extension in 2023.

==Gameplay==

The four men of the game&#x27;s hero gang, The Cobras, fight through waves of enemies to rescue Kate, The Cobras&#x27; fifth member, who was kidnapped by the Dead End Gang. As with most beat-em-ups, the game features primarily side-scrolling action. Player score is based on number of opponents eliminated.

The option of attacking an enemy while they are knocked down was new to the genre. The game uses &#x27;punch&#x27; and &#x27;kick&#x27; buttons rather than &#x27;jump&#x27; and &#x27;attack&#x27;. The special punch-plus-kick attack is the only aerial attack. Every time this special attack is performed, it takes away one bar of energy from the character. The players can also use different weapons that belong to enemies or are hidden inside boxes, including a shotgun (with limited cartridges), baseball bats, knives, and bottles. Players can also double-team enemies and vice versa.

After defeating the Big Boss at the end of the chapters, the game continues: first it resuscitates all the bosses for a massive final fight, and if the player defeats them all, then the game repeats endlessly, with an amped-up level of difficulty.

==Plot==
Dead End City is a place controlled with a firm grip by the &quot;Dead End&quot; gang, an endless parade of violent criminals. Their only obstacle is the opposing hero gang, called The Cobras. The Cobras number five members: Blood (former prizefighter), Hawk (former professional wrestler), Boomer (a martial artist), Sledge (a military ex-convict) and Kate, the damsel in distress, described as Hawk&#x27;s protegee. One day, Kate is kidnapped by the Dead End Gang under the leadership of Faust, who is looking for the leadership of all street gangs in an attempt to take full control of the city. The four men go to enemy territory to save Kate, fighting through the waves of enemies sent against them.

==Development==
&quot;Vendetta&quot; was showcased at the 1991 Las Vegas Amusement Expo.

==Controversy and censorship==
&quot;Vendetta&quot; was censored and edited in some countries when released outside of the Asian market to remove an enemy character who dresses in leather (in a S &amp; M style) and fights by grabbing hold of the playable character and then proceeding to dry hump and lick him; if there are two of these leather-clad enemies on the screen simultaneously, the other one will sometimes dry hump a light pole until the bulbs from it drop on his head, bludgeoning him. The character also continues to do the same if the protagonist is down on the floor, and a second type of dog enemy (a Dobermann) was also removed from the game for doing a similar action to the playable characters. These aspects of the game were heavily censored particularly in the United States, while the uncensored version was released in Japan, and other countries like Argentina and Brazil.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Vendetta&quot; on their August 1, 1991 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month. In North America, it was the top-grossing new video game on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in September 1991.

British gaming magazine &quot;The One&quot; reviewed &quot;Vendetta&quot; in 1991, reviewing it alongside &quot;D.D. Crew&quot;, calling both &quot;quite excellent&quot; and stating that &quot;one will probably fade into insignificance at the expense of the other. If it was up to me, Konami&#x27;s &quot;Vendetta&quot; would be the one to take the prizes.&quot; &quot;The One&quot; states that &quot;Vendetta&quot; has &quot;a lot more atmosphere&quot; than &quot;D. D. Crew&quot;, and praises its graphics as being &quot;moody, much more imaginatively drawn - and the animations are smooth and inventive&quot;, despite the game having smaller sprites. The review concludes with, &quot;&quot;Vendetta&quot; has both class and imagination,&quot; and calls its gameplay &quot;a cathartic experience&quot;.

&quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine awarded it &quot;Best Beat&#x27;Em Up Game&quot; in 1991, along with Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;WWF WrestleFest&quot;.

A 2022 video game, &quot;Final Vendetta&quot;, paid homage to Vendetta.

In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their Top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list.

<doc id="1001412" wikidata="Q513727" url="?curid=1001412" title="Samtredia">
<text>Samtredia ( ) is a town in Imereti, Georgia, lying in a lowland between the rivers Rioni and Tskhenis-Tsqali, west of the capital Tbilisi, and west of Georgia&#x27;s third largest city Kutaisi. Georgia&#x27;s most important roads and railways converge there, making Samtredia the country&#x27;s vital transport hub. The Kopitnari Airport is also located in from Samtredia. The town&#x27;s population is 25,318 as of the 2014 all-Georgia census. The climate is humid subtropical, with mild and warm winters and hot summers.

==History==
Samtredia evolved from a crucial railway junction in the 1870s and acquired town status in 1921. In the 1895s there was built the first school in town, 14th public school which today is known as 12th public school. Under Soviet rule, the local economy diversified from transportation to food and wood production. 

Due to its strategic location, Samtredia played a prominent role in the civil unrest early in the 1990s when anti-Soviet opposition groups blocked the Samtredia junction from July 26 to 31 1990 in order to force the Soviet Georgian leadership to adopt a liberal election code. The junction was again blocked in March–April 1991, this time by the new government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, in an attempt to exert pressure on the central Soviet authorities. This blockade, however, inflicted heavy damage not only to the economy of Georgia but to the neighbouring Armenia, which was largely dependent on Georgia’s railways. 

In 1993, Samtredia became one of the major battlegrounds in the Georgian Civil War in which the forces loyal to the ousted President Gamsakhurdia confronted the post-coup government troops, and briefly controlled the town from October 17 to October 23, 1993, putting all communications to Tbilisi under threat. Although Samtredia has been stable ever since, the post-Soviet crisis resulted in a significant economic decline that have since only been partially reversed.

Designed by architect T. F. McNamara it had two balconies in the 1,900-seat auditorium with 32 private boxes. Despite its name, the La Scala was a cinema. Paramount Pictures took over the lease on the building and renamed it the Capitol in 1927. Under new management, the Capitol ran a live show every week to accompany the current film.

Well-known Irish acts to appear in these shows included Peggy Dell, Martin Crosbie, brother of Paddy Crosbie, creator of the School Around the Corner, and Sean Mooney. The last stage show was on 29 October 1953. The Capitol continued as a cinema until 1972. It was demolished along with the adjacent Metropole Cinema and a branch of the department store chain British Home Stores was built on the site. This in turn closed and was replaced by a branch of the Irish Penneys chain.

<text>Andrew Terry Awford (born 14 July 1972) is an English football coach and former footballer who was most recently the Youth Academy and Development Manager at Luton Town. Prior to this, he was the manager of Portsmouth, a club where he spent the vast majority of his playing and coaching career. Awford was selected by the FA in 2012 to participate on their new level 5 qualification, The FA Professional / Elite Award, which he successfully completed and graduated in June 2013 at St Georges Park.

==Playing career==
Awford began his career at his home-town club Worcester City where he became the youngest player ever to appear in the FA Cup, aged just 15 years 88 days, when he came on as substitute in a tie at Boreham Wood.

He went on to sign professional terms with Second Division side Portsmouth in 1989 at the age of 16, making almost 400 first-team appearances in an 11-year career. Awford was part of the &quot;Pompey&quot; side that reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1992, losing to Liverpool in a penalty shootout. In his time at the club, he also played ten times for the England under-21s.

In 1994, Awford suffered a succession of injuries, including a broken leg, which kept him from playing for 14 months. He went on to play in subsequent campaigns, but further injuries throughout the 2000–01 season led him to retire from professional football at the age of 28. His last competitive appearance for &quot;Pompey&quot; came against Queens Park Rangers on 4 November 2000.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Awford took up the position of chief scout and later reserve team manager at Portsmouth. In April 2006, he was appointed the first team coach at Oxford United under his former Portsmouth manager Jim Smith and in June 2008 became assistant manager of Bognor Regis Town. Awford resigned along with manager Mick Jenkins in January 2009.

He obtained a UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; Licence and worked as a PE Teacher in Petersfield before returning to Portsmouth as the club&#x27;s Academy Manager in February 2011. Following Michael Appleton&#x27;s move to Blackpool in November 2012, Guy Whittingham was made caretaker manager of Portsmouth with Awford appointed as his assistant. Despite being given only temporary roles, the pair remained in charge for the rest of the 2012–13 season. In June 2013 Awford graduated from The FA Professional / Elite level 5 accreditation. In November 2013, Whittingham, who had been named as permanent manager, was sacked and Awford named as caretaker manager. On 9 December, Richie Barker was named as permanent manager with Awford returning to work with the club&#x27;s academy.

On 27 March 2014, Barker left on mutual terms and Awford was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2013–14 season. Awford won his first five matches in charge to ensure Portsmouth would avoid relegation from The Football League. Awford subsequently won April&#x27;s League Two Manager of the Month.

On 1 May 2014, it was announced that Awford would be appointed as Portsmouth manager on a permanent basis on a one-year rolling contract. Awford won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February during the 2014–15 season following an unbeaten month, guiding the club to four wins and two draws. However, a poor run of form in the next ten games led to Awford leaving Portsmouth by mutual consent on 13 April 2015, with the club sitting in 14th position in the table.

On 26 June 2015, Awford joined Luton Town as Youth Academy and Development Manager. Awford took over as caretaker manager following John Still&#x27;s sacking in December 2015, leading the club to one win, a draw and two losses. Awford returned to his academy role following the appointment of Nathan Jones as permanent Luton manager in January 2016. Awford left Luton in April 2022.

<text>Bita Lahrakhani (; 3 January 1958 – 25 November 2023), better known as Bita Farrahi (Persian: ), was an Iranian actress.

==Career==
Bita Farrahi studied art at John Powers&#x27; School in the United States. She worked as a professional model for art magazines in California, left the US in 1985, and returned to Iran.

Bita Farahi Laharkhani was born on January 3, 1958, in Tehran, Iran. She is the daughter of Monir Farahi and Cyrus Laharkhani Dinbali, and she is the niece of Farhang Farahi. Bita&#x27;s mother was involved in artistic activities in the 1930s and performed on theater stages, while her father produced cultural and artistic programs for Radio Tehran.

Naser Cheshmazar introduced her to Dariush Mehrjui for the role of Mahshid in the film &quot;Hamoun&quot; (1989), marking Bita Farahi&#x27;s debut in acting at the age of 31. Her performance in &quot;Hamoun&quot; earned her the Diploma of Honor for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 8th Fajr Film Festival. In the following years, Farahi continued her career with directors such as Ahmad Reza Darvish, Bahman Farmanara, Masoud Kimiai, and Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, receiving nominations for the Crystal Simorgh Award for her roles in &quot;Kimia&quot; (1994), &quot;A House on Water&quot; (2001), and &quot;Blood Play&quot; (2006).

<text>Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound primarily used in the manufacturing of various plastics. It is a colourless solid which is soluble in most common organic solvents, but has very poor solubility in water. BPA is produced on an industrial scale by the condensation reaction of phenol and acetone. Global production in 2022 was estimated to be in the region of 10 million tonnes.

BPA&#x27;s largest single application is as a co-monomer in the production of polycarbonates, which accounts for 65–70% of all BPA production. The manufacturing of epoxy resins and vinyl ester resins account for 25–30% of BPA use. The remaining 5% is used as a major component of several high-performance plastics, and as a minor additive in PVC, polyurethane, thermal paper, and several other materials. It is not a plasticizer, although it is often wrongly labelled as such.

The health effects of BPA have been the subject of prolonged public and scientific debate. BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting hormone-like properties that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Although the effect is very weak, the pervasiveness of BPA-containing materials raises concerns, as exposure is effectively lifelong. Many BPA-containing materials are non-obvious but commonly encountered, and include coatings for the inside of food cans, clothing designs, shop receipts, and dental fillings. BPA has been investigated by public health agencies in many countries, as well as by the World Health Organization. While normal exposure is below the level currently associated with risk, several jurisdictions have taken steps to reduce exposure on a precautionary basis, in particular by banning BPA from baby bottles. There is some evidence that BPA exposure in infants has decreased as a result of this. BPA-free plastics have also been introduced, which are manufactured using alternative bisphenols such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F, but there is also controversy around whether these are actually safer.

== History ==
Bisphenol A was first reported in 1891 by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Dianin.

In 1934, workers at I.G. Farbenindustrie reported the coupling of BPA and epichlorohydrin. Over the following decade, coatings and resins derived from similar materials were described by workers at the companies of DeTrey Freres in Switzerland and DeVoe and Raynolds in the US. This early work underpinned the development of epoxy resins, which in turn motivated production of BPA. The utilization of BPA further expanded with discoveries at Bayer and General Electric on polycarbonate plastics. These plastics first appeared in 1958, being produced by Mobay, General Electric, and Bayer.

The British biochemist Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen in the early 1930s. Subsequent work found that it bound to estrogen receptors tens of thousands of times more weakly than estradiol, the major natural female sex hormone. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. BPA was never used as a drug.

== Production ==
The synthesis of BPA still follows Dianin&#x27;s general method, with the fundamentals changing little in 130 years. The condensation of acetone (hence the suffix &#x27;A&#x27; in the name) with two equivalents of phenol is catalyzed by a strong acid, such as concentrated hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or a solid acid resin such as the sulfonic acid form of polystyrene sulfonate. An excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation and to limit the formation of byproducts, such as Dianin&#x27;s compound. BPA is fairly cheap to produce, as the synthesis benefits from a high atom economy and large amounts of both starting materials are available from the cumene process. As the only by-product is water, it may be considered an industrial example of green chemistry. Global production in 2022 was estimated to be in the region of 10 million tonnes.

Usually, the addition of acetone takes place at the para position on both phenols, however minor amounts of the ortho-para (up to 3%) and ortho-ortho isomers are also produced, along with several other minor by‑products. These are not always removed and are known impurities in commercial samples of BPA.

==Properties==
BPA has a fairly high melting point but can be easily dissolved in a broad range of organic solvents including toluene, ethanol and ethyl acetate. It may be purified by recrystallisation from acetic acid with water. Crystals form in the monoclinic space group P 21/n (where n indicates the glide plane); within this individual molecules of BPA are arraigned with a 91.5° torsion angle between the phenol rings. Spectroscopic data is available from AIST.

== Uses and applications ==
===Main uses===
==== Polycarbonates ====
About 65–70% of all bisphenol A is used to make polycarbonate plastics, which can consist of nearly 90% BPA by mass. Polymerisation is achieved by a reaction with phosgene, conducted under biphasic conditions; the hydrochloric acid is scavenged with aqueous base. This process converts the individual molecules of BPA into large polymer chains, effectively trapping them.

==== Epoxy and vinyl ester resins ====
About 25–30% of all BPA is used in the manufacture of epoxy resins and vinyl ester resins. For epoxy resin, it is first converted to its diglycidyl ether (usually abbreviated BADGE or DGEBA). This is achieved by a reaction with epichlorohydrin under basic conditions.

Some of this is further reacted with methacrylic acid to form bis-GMA, which is used to make vinyl ester resins. Alternatively, and to a much lesser extent, BPA may be ethoxylated and then converted to its diacrylate and dimethacrylate derivatives (bis-EMA, or EBPADMA). These may be incorporated at low levels in vinyl ester resins to change their physical properties and see common use in dental composites and sealants.

===Minor uses===
The remaining 5% of BPA is used in a wide range of applications, many of which involve plastic. BPA is a major component of several high-performance plastics, the production of these is low compared to other plastics but still equals several thousand tons a year. Comparatively minor amounts of BPA are also used as additives or modifiers in some commodity plastics. These materials are much more common but their BPA content will be low.

====Plastics====
;As a major component 
* Polycyanurates can be produced from BPA by way of its dicyanate ester (BADCy). This is formed by a reaction between BPA and cyanogen bromide. Examples include BT-Epoxy, which is one of a number of resins used in the production of printed circuit boards.
* Polyetherimides such as Ultem can be produced from BPA via a nitro-displacement of appropriate bisnitroimides. These thermoplastic polyimide plastics have exceptional resistance to mechanical, thermal and chemical damage. They are used in medical devices and other high performance instrumentation.
* Polybenzoxazines may be produced from a number of biphenols, including BPA.
* Polysulfones can be produced from BPA and bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone forming poly(bisphenol-A sulfone) (PSF). It is used as a high performance alternative to polycarbonate.
*Bisphenol-A formaldehyde resins are a subset of phenol formaldehyde resins. They are used in the production of high-pressure laminates

;As a minor component 
* Polyurethane can incorporate BPA and its derivatives as hard segment chain extenders, particularly in memory foams.
* PVC can contain BPA and its derivatives through multiple routes. BPA is sometimes used as an antioxidant in phthalates, which are extensively used as plasticizers for PVC. BPA has also been used as an antioxidant to protect sensitive PVC heat stabilizers. Historically 5–10% by weight of BPA was included in barium-cadmium types, although these have largely been phased out due health concerns surrounding the cadmium. BPA diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is used as an acid scavenger, particularly in PVC dispersions, such as organosols or plastisols, which are used as coatings for the inside of food cans, as well as embossed clothes designs produced using heat transfer vinyl or screen printing machines.

;Derivatives used as flame retardants
BPA is used to form a number of flame retardants used in plastics.

Bromination of BPA forms tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), which is mainly used as a reactive component of polymers, meaning that it is incorporated into the polymer backbone. It is used to prepare fire-resistant polycarbonates by replacing some bisphenol A. A lower grade of TBBPA is used to prepare epoxy resins, used in printed circuit boards. TBBPA is also converted to TBBPA-BDBPE which can be used as a flame retardant in polypropylene. TBBPA-BDBPE is not chemically bonded to the polymer and can leach out into the environment. The use of these compounds is diminishing due to restrictions on brominated flame retardants. The reaction of BPA with phosphorus oxychloride and phenol forms BADP, which is used as a liquid flame retarder in some high performance polymer blends such as polycarbonate/ABS mixtures that are used to form the casings for household electronics.

====Other applications====
* BPA is used as an antioxidant in several fields, particularly in brake fluids.
*BPA is used as a developing agent in thermal paper (shop receipts). Recycled paper products can also contain BPA, although this can depend strongly on how it is recycled. Deinking can remove 95% of BPA, with the pulp produced used to make newsprint, toilet paper and facial tissues. If deinking is not performed then the BPA remains in the fibers, paper recycled this way is usually made into corrugated fiberboard.
* Ethoxylated BPA finds minor use as a &#x27;levelling agent&#x27; in tin electroplating. 
* Several drug candidates have also been developed from bisphenol A, including ralaniten, ralaniten acetate, and EPI-001.

==BPA substitutes==

Concerns about the health effects of BPA have led some manufacturers replacing it with other bisphenols, such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F. These are produced in a similar manner to BPA, by replacing acetone with other compounds, which undergo analogous condensation reactions. Thus, in bisphenol F, the F signifies formaldehyde.
Health concerns have also been raised about these substitutes. Alternative polymers, such as tritan copolyester have been developed to give the same properties as polycarbonate (durable, clear) without using BPA or its analogues. 

==Human safety==
===Exposure===
As a result of the presence of BPA in plastics and other commonplace materials, most people are frequently exposed to trace levels of BPA. The primary source of human exposure is via food, as epoxy and PVC are used to line the inside of food cans to prevent corrosion of the metal by acidic foodstuffs. Polycarbonate drink containers are also a source of exposure, although most disposable drinks bottles are actually made of PET, which contains no BPA. Among the non-food sources, exposure routes include through dust, thermal paper, clothing, dental materials, and medical devices. Although BPA exposure is common, it does not accumulate within the body, with toxicokinetic studies showing the biological half-life of BPA in adult humans to be around two to five hours. During its elimination, the body first converts BPA into more water-soluble compounds via glucuronidation or sulfation, which are then removed from the body through urine. This allows exposure to be easily determined by urine testing, facilitating convenient biomonitoring of populations. Food and drink containers made from Bisphenol A-containing plastics do not contaminate the content to cause any increased cancer risk.

===Health effects and regulation===

The health effects of BPA have been the subject of prolonged public and scientific discourse, with PubMed listing more than 18,000 publishings related to the subject as of 2024. Concern is mostly related to its estrogen-like activity, although it can interact with other receptor systems as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. These interactions are all very weak, but exposure to BPA is effectively lifelong, leading to concern over possible cumulative effects. Studying this sort of long‑term, low‑dose interaction is difficult, and although there have been numerous studies, there are considerable discrepancies in their conclusions regarding the nature of the effects observed as well as the levels at which they occur. A common criticism is that industry-sponsored trials tend to show BPA as being safer than studies performed by academic or government laboratories, although this has also been explained in terms of industry studies being better designed.

In the 2010s public health agencies in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Japan as well as the WHO all reviewed the health risks of BPA, and found normal exposure to be below the level currently associated with risk. Regardless, due to the scientific uncertainty, many jurisdictions continued to take steps to reduce exposure on a precautionary basis. In particular, infants were considered to be at greater risk, leading to bans on the use of BPA in baby bottles and related products by the US, Canada, and EU amongst others. Bottle producers largely switched from polycarbonate to polypropylene and there is some evidence that BPA exposure in infants has decreased as a result of this. The European Food Safety Authority completed a re-evaluation into the risks of BPA in 2023, concluding that its tolerable daily intake should be greatly reduced. This led the European Union to ban BPA in all the food contact materials, including plastic and coated packaging, in December of 2024. The ban will come into force after an implementation period of up to three years.

BPA exhibits very low acute toxicity (i.e. from a single large dose) as indicated by its LD50 of 4 g/kg (mouse). Reports indicate that it is a minor skin irritant as well, although less so than phenol.

=== Pharmacology ===
BPA has been found to interact with a diverse range of hormone receptors, in both humans and animals. It binds to both of the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. BPA is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or partial agonist of the ER, so it can serve as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist. However, it is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol, the major female sex hormone in humans. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound has been found to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and aromatase expression and interfering with LH receptor-ligand binding.

Bisphenol A&#x27;s interacts with the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-γ in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).

== Environmental safety ==
===Distribution and degradation===
BPA has been detectable in the natural environment since the 1990s and is now widely distributed. It is primarily a river pollutant, but has also been observed in the marine environment, in soils, and lower levels can also be detected in air. The solubility of BPA in water is low (~300 g per ton of water) but this is still sufficient to make it a significant means of distribution into the environment. Many of the largest sources of BPA pollution are water-based, particularly wastewater from industrial facilities using BPA.
Paper recycling can be a major source of release when this includes thermal paper, leaching from PVC items may also be a significant source, as can landfill leachate.

In all cases, wastewater treatment can be highly effective at removing BPA, giving reductions of 91–98%. Regardless, the remaining 2–9% of BPA will continue through to the environment, with low levels of BPA commonly observed in surface water and sediment in the U.S. and Europe.

Once in the environment BPA is aerobically biodegraded by a wide a variety of organisms. Its half life in water has been estimated at between 4.5 and 15 days, degradation in the air is faster than this, while soil samples degrade more slowly. BPA in sediment degrades most slowly of all, particularly where this is anaerobic. Abiotic degradation has been reported, but is generally slower than biodegradation. Pathways include photo-oxidation, or reactions with minerals such as goethite which may be present in soils and sediments.

===Environmental effects===
BPA is an environmental contaminant of emerging concern. Despite its short half-life and non-bioaccumulating character, the continuous release of BPA into the environment causes continuous exposure to both plant and animal life. Although many studies have been performed, these often focus on a limited range of model organisms and can use BPA concentrations well beyond environmental levels. As such, the precise effects of BPA on the growth, reproduction, and development of aquatic organism are not fully understood. Regardless, the existing data shows the effects of BPA on wildlife to be generally negative. BPA appears able to affect development and reproduction in a wide range of wildlife, with certain species being particularly sensitive, such as invertebrates and amphibians.

<text>Pietro Gasparri (5 May 1852 – 18 November 1934) was a Roman Catholic cardinal, diplomat and politician in the Roman Curia and the signatory of the Lateran Pacts. He served also as Cardinal Secretary of State under Popes Benedict XV and Pope Pius XI.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Gasparri was born on 5 May 1852 in Capovallazza di Ussita, a small village in the Apennine Mountains in central Italy (in the modern province of Macerata, then part of the Papal States). His parents were Bernardino Gasparri and Giovanna Sili. The youngest of 10 children born to a family of shepherds, Pietro was the favorite.

His cousin went on to become Cardinal Augusto Silj.

Pietro was a weak and sickly child, while his 9 siblings were strong and vivacious; some thought that he would not live long. His father would often sleep in the fields with the sheep, and Pietro entertained the family by reading stories of saints as the family was gathered by the warmth of the hearth. They would all be brought to tears as they listened to the stories of the martyrs. Pietro&#x27;s mother had the &quot;gift of tears&quot;, which she gave to all her children, especially Pietro, according to his memoir.

===Canonical scholar and curial diplomat===
He was for many years the head of the Department of Canon Law at the Catholic University of Paris, where he was a professor from 1880 to 1898. He served as the Apostolic delegate to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru from 1898 to 1901, when he became a member of the Curia and returned to Rome.

Shortly after becoming pope, Pius X asked Gasparri how long it would take to codify canon law. Gasparri answered that, with sufficient staff, it could be done in 25 years. Pius X replied, &quot;Then do it&quot;. Gasparri was called to Rome in 1904 to take the post of Secretary for the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law, in which he spent the next 13 years in seclusion, digesting volumes of decrees and studies compiled over centuries to create the first definitive legal text in the history of Catholicism. His efforts resulted in the &quot;1917 Code of Canon Law&quot;, in effect until 1983. On 18 October 1917, Pope Benedict named him the first president of the newly created Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law. Beginning in 1929, he also played a significant role in early stages of the codification of Eastern Catholic canon law.

===Secretary of State===
He was made a Cardinal-Priest of S. Bernardo alle Terme in 1907. In January 1915 he chose to become Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina, however he retained in commendam his former title until December 1915.

He served as the Cardinal Secretary of State under Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI, beginning with his appointment on 13 October 1914.

On 4 December 1916 he became Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.

===1922 conclave===
In the 1922 conclave that elected Pope Pius XI, Gasparri was the &quot;champion of the moderates&quot; who wanted to continue Pope Benedict XV&#x27;s more centrist policies vis-à-vis the modern world. He was 69 years old and considered a possible compromise candidate for the papacy.

===Retirement and death===
By 1928, Gasparri was suffering from heart disease and diabetes, slept poorly, and—despite Pius XI&#x27;s urging—refused to take time off, fearing that the pope would replace him in his absence. For years, he had been receiving signals that his services were no longer valued by the pope.

He submitted his resignation as Secretary of State and after several weeks Pope Pius accepted it on 7 October 1930.

Gasparri died on 18 November 1934. At his death he was still President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Codification of the Canon Law of the Eastern Churches, and Camerlengo.

==Canon Law reform==
In response to the request of the bishops at the First Vatican Council, Pope Pius X ordered the creation of a general Roman Catholic canon law codification, which did not exist at that time. He entrusted Pietro Gasparri, who was aided in the work by Giacomo della Chiesa (the future Benedict XV) and Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pius XII). Perhaps the ablest canonist in the Roman Curia at the time, the work of codification, simplification, and modernization of canon law was for the most part the work of Gasparri.

Work began with collecting and reducing diverse documents into a single code, presenting the normative portion in the form of systematic short canons shorn of the preliminary considerations (&quot;Whereas ...&quot; etc.) and omitting those parts that had been superseded by later developments. The code was promulgated on 27 May 1917 as &quot;The Code of Canon Law&quot; (Latin: &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot;) by Pope Benedict XV, who set 19 May 1918 as the date on which it came into force. For the most part, it applied only to the Latin Church except when &quot;it treats of things that, by their nature, apply to the Oriental&quot;, such as the effects of baptism (cf. canon 87). In the succeeding decades, some parts of the 1917 Code were retouched, especially under Pope Pius XII.

==Papal diplomacy==

Under Gasparri&#x27;s leadership, the Vatican successfully concluded a record number of diplomatic agreements with European governments, many of which heading new states, created after World War I. On 29 March 1924, a concordat was signed between Gasparri and Bavaria, with France on 10 February 1925, Czechoslovakia on 2 February 1928, Portugal on 15 April 1928, and Romania on 19 May 1932.

===Lateran Treaty===
The Lateran Treaty is the crowning achievement of Pietro Gasparri, as it ended the sixty-year conflict between the Vatican and the Kingdom of Italy. It was signed on 11 February 1929, with Mussolini himself signing on behalf of Italy. It includes three agreements made in 1929 between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, ratified on 7 June 1929, thus ending the &quot;Roman Question&quot;. Main Vatican negotiator for Pietro Gasparri was the Roman lawyer Francesco Pacelli, the brother of then-Apostolic Nuncio to Germany Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII). On the day of the signing, before leaving for the Lateran Palace, Gasparri met with Pius XI in order for him to approve the final draft of the agreements. After kneeling for the pope&#x27;s blessing, Gasparri left the room with tears in his eyes, feeling the enormous importance of what would take place later that day.

=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===

Gasparri&#x27;s watch in the Vatican coincided with major changes in Europe after World War I. With the Russian Revolution, the Vatican was faced with a new, so far unknown situation, an ideology and government which rejected not only the Catholic Church but religion as a whole.

=== Lithuania and Estonia ===

Gasparri managed to conclude a concordat with Lithuania. The relations with Russia changed drastically for a second reason. The Baltic states and Poland gained their independence from Russia after World War I, thus enabling a relatively free Church life in those former Russian countries. Estonia was the first country to look for Vatican ties. On 11 April 1919 Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri informed the Estonian authorities that the Vatican would agree to have diplomatic relations. A concordat was agreed upon in principle a year later, June 1920. It was signed on 30 May 1922. It guarantees freedom for the Catholic Church, establishes an archdiocese, liberates clergy from military service, allows the creation of seminaries and catholic schools, describes church property rights and immunity. The Archbishop swears alliance to Estonia.

Relations with Catholic Lithuania were slightly more complicated because of the Polish occupation of Vilnius, a city and archiepiscopal seat, which Lithuania claimed as well as its own, though the majority of its population was Polish and it was a major center of Polish culture. Polish forces had occupied Vilnius. This generated several protests of Lithuania to the Holy See. Relations with the Holy See were defined during the pontificate of Pope Pius XI (1922–1939).

Lithuania was recognized by the Vatican in November 1922. The recognition included a stipulation by Pietro Gasparri to Lithuania. There were diplomatic standstills, as the Lithuanian government refused to accept virtually all episcopal appointments by the Vatican. The relations did not improve when, in April 1926, Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized the Lithuanian ecclesiastical province without regard to Lithuanian demands and proposals, the real bone of contention being Vilnius which belonged to Poland.

In autumn 1925, Mečislovas Reinys, a Catholic professor of theology, became the Lithuanian foreign minister and asked for an agreement. The Lithuanian military took over a year later and a proposal of a concordat, drafted by the papal visitator Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius, was agreed upon by the end of 1926. The concordat was signed a year later. Its content follows largely the Polish Concordat of 1925.

=== Poland ===

In October 1918 Pope Benedict XV congratulated the Polish people on their independence. In a public letter to the archbishop Kakowski of Warsaw, he remembered their loyalty and the many efforts of the Holy See to assist them. He expressed his hopes that Poland would again take its place in the family of nations and continue its history as an educated Christian nation. In March 1919, he nominated ten new bishops and, soon after, Achille Ratti, already in Warsaw as his representative, as papal nuncio. He repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecuting Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy. During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw, he asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland. Gasparri sent Nuncio Ratti to stay in the Polish capital. On 11 June 1921 he wrote to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging again peaceful coexistence with neighbouring people, stating that &quot;love of country has its limits in justice and obligations&quot;. He sent nuncio Ratti to Silesia to act against potential political agitations of the Catholic clergy.

Ratti, a scholar, intended to work for Poland and build bridges to the Soviet Union, hoping even to shed his blood for Russia. Pope Benedict XV needed him as a diplomat and not as a martyr and forbade any trip into the USSR, although he was the official papal delegate for Russia. Therefore, he discontinued his contact with Russia. This did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. He was asked to go. &quot;While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure, after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned&quot; by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy. November 20, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti&#x27;s expulsion climaxed in Warsaw. Two years later, Achille Ratti became Pope Pius XI, shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with Pietro Gasparri and Eugenio Pacelli for the following thirty-six years. (1922–1958)
During the pontificate of Pope Pius XI,(1922–1939) Church life in Poland flourished: There were some anti-clerical groups opposing the new role of the Church especially in education. But numerous religious meetings and congresses, feasts and pilgrimages, many of which were accompanied by supportive letters from the Pontiff, took place.

Under the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, his Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri with unusual candour expressed his views on the post-war order and the future of Poland: He told Ludwig von Pastor that the Peace Treaty of Versailles will most certainly end in a new war, maybe even ten wars. He expressed his pleasure at the outcome of the Locarno treaty. However, the Polish Corridor continued to be a dark point in his estimation, requiring compromises. At the same time, he opined, Poland can only exist if she works either with her neighbour in the East or West. Since the Soviet Union could not be relied upon, he considered it &quot;outright stupid, to destroy bridges to the West. Poland will have to pay dearly later on, once Germany recuperates&quot;.

====Concordat with Poland====
On 10 February 1925 a concordat (Concordat of 1925) was signed between Pietro Gasparri, Cardinal Secretary of State for the Vatican, and Stanislaw Grabski for Poland. The concordat has 27 articles, which guarantee the freedom of the Church and the faithful. It regulates the usual points of interests, Catholic instruction in primary schools and secondary schools, nomination of bishops, establishment of seminaries, and a permanent nuncio in Warsaw, who also represents the interests of the Holy See in Gdańsk. The concordat stipulates, that no part of Polish territory can be placed under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside of Poland

The Church enjoys full protection of the State, and prays for the leaders of Poland during Sunday Mass and on 3 May. Clerics make a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish State If clergy are under accusation, trial documents will be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy are accused of crimes. If convicted, they will not serve incarceration in jails but will be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent. The concordat extends to the Latin rite in five ecclesiastical provinces of Gniezno and Poznan, Varsovie, Wilno, Lwow and Cracovie. It applies as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwow, and Przemysl, and, to the Armenian rite in Lwow. for religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law must be observed. Catholic instruction is mandatory in all public schools, except universities. In Article 24 Church and State recognize each other&#x27;s property rights seeming in part from the time of partition before 1918. This means, property rights and real estate titles of the Church are respected. A later agreement will define the status of expropriated Church properties. Until that time, the State will pay Church endowments for its clergy.
On paper the concordat seemed to be a victory for the Church. But Polish bishops felt forced to take measures against early violations, in the area of marriage legislation and property rights. Pope Pius XI was supportive of this and of episcopal initiatives to have their own plenary meetings.

In the Florestano Vancini&#x27;s film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Gasparri is played by Michele Malaspina.

<doc id="1001441" wikidata="Q295416" url="?curid=1001441" title="Luis García (footballer, born 1978)">
<text>Luis Javier García Sanz (born 24 June 1978) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a winger.

He played professionally for Barcelona and Atlético Madrid in his homeland, amongst others – being brought up in the former&#x27;s youth ranks – appearing abroad for Liverpool, with whom he won the 2005 Champions League and the 2006 FA Cup. Over the course of eight seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 150 games and 22 goals.

A Spain international for three years, García earned 18 caps and represented the nation at the 2006 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Barcelona===
Born in Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, García began playing football with local Badalona at the age of 6, arriving at Barcelona&#x27;s academy six years later from neighbours Sant Gabriel. After two successful seasons with their reserves, he left on loan for Real Valladolid, where he made his La Liga debut on 22 August 1999 in a 1–0 away loss against Numancia. He finished the campaign at Segunda División&#x27;s Toledo also on loan, his four goals not being enough to prevent relegation for the Castilla–La Mancha side; on 18 August 1998, he had made his first competitive appearance for the &quot;Blaugrana&quot;, coming on as 78th-minute substitute for Boudewijn Zenden in a 2–1 defeat at Mallorca in the Supercopa de España.

Subsequently, García played another year in the second tier, being instrumental in Tenerife&#x27;s promotion by scoring 16 league goals under the guidance of manager Rafael Benítez. Loaned for the fourth time by Barcelona, he returned to Valladolid for 2001–02, netting seven top-division goals in 25 matches, including two in a 5–1 away victory over Tenerife.

===Atlético Madrid===
In the 2002–03 season, García was sold to Atlético Madrid for €3.6 million but, after a highly successful individual campaign (nine league goals), Barcelona activated a clause which allowed the player&#x27;s return for an additional €1.4 million. He had another good year at the Camp Nou, helping the team to the second place in the league, five points behind champions Valencia.

===Liverpool===
García was signed by former Tenerife coach Benítez for Liverpool on 20 August 2004, on a five-year contract for a fee of £6 million. He was the fourth Spaniard the club acquired that summer and, nine days after arriving, made his Premier League debut in a 1–0 away loss to Bolton Wanderers, where he had an apparently legitimate goal ruled out for offside. His first goal with his new club concluded a 3–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion at Anfield on 11 September, and he went on to net seven more times in the league that season, including the headed winner in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 20 March 2005.

García was also a key player in Liverpool&#x27;s successful campaign in the UEFA Champions League, scoring winning goals against Juventus and Chelsea (a controversial one in the fourth minute, dubbed a &quot;ghost goal&quot; by Chelsea manager José Mourinho), in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. Having appeared in the final against AC Milan, he finished his first season in English football with 13 goals in all competitions.
García did not make so much of an impact in the 2005–06 campaign, although he weighed in with some vital goals, including one against Chelsea to put them out of the FA Cup in the semi-finals. He was suspended for the final victory over West Ham United, having been sent off in a league game just days after his semi-final winner, against the same opposition. Early into the season, he also scored the third goal in the &quot;Reds&quot;&#x27; 2005 UEFA Super Cup 3–1 final defeat of CSKA Moscow.

On 10 January 2007, following the 6–3 defeat to Arsenal in the League Cup which was his final game for Liverpool, it was announced that García had ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during the game. He would be out for at least six months.

His positive relationship with the fans was in great measure due to his decisive goals against Chelsea. It was further underlined by the song frequently sung in his honour, to the tune of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;: &quot;Luis García, he drinks Sangria/he came from Barça to bring us joy!/He&#x27;s five-foot seven, he&#x27;s football heaven/So please don&#x27;t take our Luis away!&quot; In the 2013 poll of the &quot;100 Players Who Shook the Kop&quot;, García ranked 34th. He totalled 30 goals in 122 competitive appearances during his tenure, with ten coming in the Champions League, five in the knockout stages of the 2005 triumph.

===Return to Spain===
In early July 2007, García joined his former team Atlético Madrid for around £4 million, with his transfer being negotiated between the two clubs around the same time that they were arranging a deal for Fernando Torres in the opposite direction. Nonetheless, these deals were conducted separately.

García managed 30 appearances in his first season, acting mainly as backup to Portugal&#x27;s Simão Sabrosa. He played both matches against his former side Liverpool in the following campaign&#x27;s Champions League group stage; on 4 November 2008, he came on as a late substitute at Anfield to appreciative applause. During the league, however, he fell out of favour, sometimes not even making the list of 18.

On 11 August 2009, García reached an agreement with Racing de Santander. His season was quite unassuming, as he took part in just 18 games without scoring and the Cantabrians narrowly avoided relegation.

===Later years===
García signed a one-year contract with Greek club Panathinaikos on 28 August 2010. On 4 September, he flew back to Anfield to take part in Carragher&#x27;s testimonial match, scoring a goal in the second minute. He returned to the Camp Nou ten days later, playing the last 20 minutes of a 5–1 loss in the Champions League group phase.
On 1 July 2011, the 33-year-old García moved to Mexican team Puebla. He scored his first goal for &quot;La Franja&quot; on the 24th, through a penalty kick away to Atlas (1–0).

In early June 2012, García signed for another side in the Liga MX, UNAM, joining alongside Martín Romagnoli for an undisclosed fee. He made his official debut against Atlas, playing 34 minutes from the bench.

García announced his retirement from football on 14 January 2014, aged 35. He made the announcement on his official website, saying, &quot;Today I&#x27;ve decided to retire as a professional footballer, thanks for the interest from the teams that spoke with me in recent weeks, but I think the time has come to end this important chapter in my life and move to the next page.&quot;

García came out of retirement in July 2014, joining newly formed Indian Super League franchise Atlético de Kolkata as their marquee player ahead of the league&#x27;s inaugural season, the first of such players to join the league. He started in the league&#x27;s opening match, as his new team won 3–0 at home against Mumbai City. On 21 November he had a wrongly disallowed goal in an eventual 2–1 loss at Kerala Blasters but, despite finishing the regular season in third, Kolkata won the league final against the same adversary, although he was an unused substitute; he also won the league&#x27;s Manyavar Most Exciting Player award.

Due to concerns over his injury record, García was not retained for the 2015 campaign. On 16 January 2016, he signed for Central Coast Mariners initially until the end of the campaign. He made his A-League debut one week later, coming off the bench and playing a role in his team&#x27;s goal in a 2–1 home defeat to Western Sydney Wanderers. In the next match, against Wellington Phoenix, he was again brought in as a replacement, scoring once and setting up two more in the 3–1 win.

==International career==
After a productive first season with Liverpool, García made his debut for the Spain national team on 26 March 2005, appearing in a 3–0 friendly defeat of China in Salamanca. On 12 November that year, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 home win over Slovakia for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification play-offs.

García was then chosen as part of the nation&#x27;s squad-of-23 for the finals in Germany. He started in victories against Ukraine and Tunisia, and was used as a substitute in the round-of-16 3–1 loss to France.

==Style of play==
Although naturally left-footed, García was skilled with both feet and had a good aerial game despite a small frame. He was also often deployed as a second striker.

==Post-retirement==
After retiring, García worked as pundit for ESPN and beIN Sports, notably covering UEFA Euro 2016 for the latter channel.

<doc id="1001443" wikidata="Q469335" url="?curid=1001443" title="Corneille Guillaume Beverloo">
<text>Corneille – Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo (3 July 1922 – 5 September 2010), better known under his pseudonym Corneille, was a Dutch artist.

Corneille was born in Liège, Belgium, although his parents were Dutch and moved back to the Netherlands when he was 12. He studied art at the Academy of Art in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. He was one of the founders of the REFLEX movement in 1948 and in 1949 he was also one of the founders of the COBRA movement, which has had great influence on Scandinavian art.
He was active within the group from the beginning, not only painting but also publishing poetry in the &quot;Cobra magazine&quot;. He was a cofounder of the &quot;&quot;.
Corneille was inspired by the drawings of children, and believed in the importance of approaching children with art that connects with their experience. When he heard during a Cobra Museum visit in the nineties that there was an “Art Lending for Children” he talked with the founder Roby Bellemans and asked him to send more information to his home in Paris about this project. He decided to promote the initiative. He started with a support list and persuaded other artists such as Shinkichi Tajiri to sign.

The poetic Corneille was strongly influenced by Miró and Klee. After the group dissolved in 1951 he moved to Paris and began collecting African art. These artifacts became evident in his works, which began to take on a more imaginative style, like landscapes seen from a bird&#x27;s eye view, exotic birds and stylised forms. His work is in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou.

Until his death Corneille lived and worked in Paris, and made visits to Israel where he worked with the Jaffa Atelier.

On 24 September 2003 an exhibition of his prints opened at the Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art, Israel. He died at Auvers-sur-Oise, France.

<doc id="1001453" wikidata="Q8870210" url="?curid=1001453" title="Kevin Bond (English footballer)">
<text>Kevin John Bond (born 22 June 1957) is an English professional football manager and former footballer who played as a centre back. He is currently first-team coach at Bristol Rovers.

==Playing career==
Bond was born in West Ham, London. He started his career as a trainee at AFC Bournemouth where his father, John Bond, was manager. When his father took up the manager&#x27;s post at Norwich City he too made the move.

His league debut was made away to Leicester City in April 1976. 161 appearances followed generating fourteen goals and earning him two England B caps.

Wanting to try his luck abroad he had a brief spell in the NASL with the Seattle Sounders.

At the start of the 1981–82 season he was again reunited with his father at Manchester City. 110 games for the Maine Road side in the next three years resulted in a lucrative transfer to Southampton, where he spent four years, playing 140 games.

He was signed by former club Bournemouth, with whom he played 126 matches, before transferring to Exeter City, Sittingbourne and Dover Athletic where he finished his career.

==Managerial and coaching career==
Bond began his coaching career as reserve team coach at former club Manchester City. Spells as coach at Wrexham and Altrincham followed, before Kevin followed his father into the managerial role when he took over at non league side Stafford Rangers in October 1997.

In early May 1998, Kevin was named as assistant manager to Alan Ball at Portsmouth. Following Ball&#x27;s sacking, Bond became first a scout for West Ham United, and then returned to Portsmouth as reserve team coach under manager Harry Redknapp.

However, following Redknapp&#x27;s resignation and subsequent appointment at rivals Southampton, Bond chose to return to his old club and was appointed as one of the coaches working under Redknapp. When then assistant Jim Smith&#x27;s contract wasn&#x27;t renewed following relegation, Bond took up the role. When Redknapp left Southampton to return once more to Portsmouth, Bond also chose to again follow him, but this time he was appointed assistant manager of the Fratton Park side.

On 1 June 2006, Bond left Portsmouth to join Newcastle United as assistant to Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder whom he had worked with previously at West Ham United. In July 2006 he completed his UEFA Pro Licence in coaching. Bonds&#x27; contract with Newcastle United was terminated on 26 September 2006 after allegations he was prepared to take bungs for players whilst at Portsmouth.

On 12 October 2006, Bond was appointed manager of Bournemouth, signing until the end of the season. Although Bournemouth lost the first five games of his reign, they avoided relegation and he was awarded a new contract.

A ten-point deduction for entering administration saw Bournemouth relegated to League Two at the end of the 2007–08 season, in spite of a run of five wins the last six games which nearly kept the club up. Bournemouth then had a further 17 points deducted for the 2008–09 season and Bond and his management team (Rob Newman and Eddie Howe) were dismissed by the Cherries on 1 September 2008 having only picked up two points from the first four matches of the season.

On 27 October 2008, Bond was re-united yet again with Harry Redknapp as assistant manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Following Redknapp&#x27;s sacking in 2012, Bond left the club in June 2012.

In November 2012, Bond was once again re-united with Harry Redknapp, at Queens Park Rangers as their assistant manager. After Harry Redknapp departed and Chris Ramsey took over as head coach, Bond became First Team Coach. In February 2015, Bond was briefly caretaker manager at QPR.

In April 2016, Bond was appointed manager of Hong Kong Premier League club Pegasus, until the end of the season. Bond led Pegasus to a double cup win during his short stint as manager.

On 6 June 2016, Bond was appointed first-team coach of Aston Villa. He left the club on 13 October of the same year, along with Steve Clarke and Massimo Battara.

On 7 November 2016, it was announced that Bond would have a second tenure as Pegasus manager. He left his role as manager for a second time in June 2017 to reunite with Redknapp as an assistant at Birmingham City. His contract at Birmingham City was terminated on 16 September 2017.

He remained with Pegasus as a consultant.

On 2 April 2019, Bond was appointed as manager of Southend United until the end of the 2018–19 season. Southend, under Bond&#x27;s managership, finished 19th in League One, successfully avoiding relegation on goal difference, following a win on the last day of the season against Sunderland.

After a run of six defeats at the start of the 2019–20 season, Bond resigned from his position of manager at Southend United on 6 September 2019.

In August 2021, Bond was appointed by Bristol Rovers to join Joey Barton&#x27;s side as a first-team coach. Having helped the club to immediate promotion back to League One with a dramatic final-day victory over Scunthorpe United, Bond departed the club in October 2022. Following his departure, manager Barton explained the decision, stating that the club&#x27;s coaching staff needed cutting down in order to streamline the approach to coaching. Following the sacking of Barton in October 2023, he returned to the club to assist interim manager Andy Mangan. Having remained on the coaching staff following the appointment of Matt Taylor, Bond was confirmed to have been given the role of first-team coach once again. He departed the club for a second time at the end of the 2023–24 season. On 26 December 2024, he returned to the club for a third spell following the appointment of Iñigo Calderón as new first-team head coach.

==Corruption allegations==

On 20 September 2006, the Football Association announced that it was to investigate allegations &quot;relating to players&#x27; agents and connected activities&quot; concerning Kevin Bond, following a BBC Panorama special on corruption in football. Newcastle United placed him on gardening leave following the broadcast, and terminated his contract on 26 September, although no charges were brought against him, and Bond has denied the allegations.

<doc id="1001456" wikidata="Q3417305" url="?curid=1001456" title="Rafael Ithier">
<text>Rafael Ithier Natal
(born August 29, 1926) is a Puerto Rican salsa musician and the founder of the highly successful orchestra El Gran Combo. Ithier was born in Río Piedras, now a part of the municipality of San Juan. 

In 2016, Ithier celebrated his 90th birthday and was interviewed by a news outlet in Puerto Rico about his contributions to Puerto Rican music.

==Early years==
Raised in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, he showed a passion for music at a very young age. His father was Nicolas Ithier and his mother Mérida Natal. His uncle, Salvador Ithier, played music together with Rafael Hernández, another of Puerto Rico&#x27;s music legends. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War. While stationed in Korea he formed a music group entitled the &quot;Los Borinquena Mambo Boys.&quot; 

==Musical career==
Ithier Nadal became an expert guitarist in the bolero genre, and he was a member of the Tito Henriquez group, &quot;Taone.&quot; His sister Esperanza later inspired him to learn how to play the piano.

Ithier Nadal and his namesake, Rafael Cortijo, knew each other and formed a friendship at an early age; rumors of animosity would later surface but they both denied it, saying they considered themselves to be &quot;like brothers.&quot; Ithier Nadal joined Cortijo&#x27;s orchestra, &quot;Cortijo y su Combo&quot;, during the 1950s. Before that, he was in a New York group named the &quot;Borinqueneers Mambo Boys.&quot;

In 1977 Ithier Nadal worked as a music arranger on the debut album for the Puerto Rican ensemble band &quot;Puerto Rico All Stars&quot;.

==El Gran Combo==
In 1962, Ithier Nadal formed &quot;El Gran Combo&quot;, becoming the orchestra&#x27;s leader. As of 2012, he was still the orchestra leader and continued to tour with the group. On his 90th birthday he was interviewed and stated that was successful because of their great discipline.

<doc id="1001464" wikidata="Q921140" url="?curid=1001464" title="Alan Rusbridger">
<text>Alan Charles Rusbridger (born 29 December 1953) is a British journalist and editor of &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine. He was formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and then principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.

Rusbridger became editor-in-chief of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1995, having been a reporter and columnist earlier in his career. Rusbridger stood down from the post at the end of May 2015 and was succeeded by Katharine Viner.

From 2015 to 2021, Rusbridger was principal of Lady Margaret Hall in the University of Oxford. He was appointed chair of the university&#x27;s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016. In 2020, Rusbridger was announced as one of the first members of the Oversight Board created by Facebook, with his appointment as the incoming editor of &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine announced in July 2021. He is an amateur pianist and published &quot;Play It Again,&quot; a book about his story of rediscovering the joy of performing &quot;Chopin Ballade No. 1&quot; later in his life.

==Life and career==

===Early career===
Rusbridger was born in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, a British protectorate (now Zambia). He is the son of B. E. ( Wickham) and G. H. Rusbridger, the director of education of Northern Rhodesia. When Rusbridger was five, the family returned to Britain and he was educated at Lanesborough Prep School, Guildford, where he was also a chorister at Guildford Cathedral, and Cranleigh School, a boys&#x27; public (independent and fee-paying) school in Surrey. At Magdalene College, Cambridge, he read English Literature. During the vacations of his first two years at university, he worked for the &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot; as an intern, and accepted a job offer from the newspaper after graduation. He stayed with the &quot;Evening News&quot; until 1979.

He then joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a reporter, and subsequently wrote the paper&#x27;s diary column and later became a feature writer. In November 1985, Rusbridger had a brief stint as a Royal reporter following the Prince and Princess of Wales around Melbourne. Fascinated by gadgets, at this stage he was already using a Tandy word processor and an early (slow) modem to file stories back to London. He left in 1986 to become TV critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;, then an entirely separate newspaper, before moving to America to be the Washington editor of the short-lived &quot;London Daily News&quot; in 1987.

After returning to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he launched the &quot;Weekend&quot; supplement in 1988, followed by the paper&#x27;s &quot;G2&quot; section. He became features editor in 1994.

===Editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;===
====Appointment and early years====
Rusbridger was appointed as the editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; by the Scott Trust in late January 1995 after a decisive vote of the National Union of Journalists chapel, management and trustees in an electoral college.

As editor, he defended the paper against a number of high-profile defamation suits, including those from the Police Federation and the Conservative MPs, Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken. In the case involving Hamilton and the lobbyist Ian Greer, he said: &quot;They weren&#x27;t going to fight us in the court so they tried to do it through the TV studio.&quot; Rusbridger countered them by being available for TV interviews over three days to ensure that their version of events did not gain precedence. Hamilton&#x27;s case collapsed shortly before a court hearing, while Aitken was demonstrated to have perjured himself, and served a prison sentence as a result.

Seen early in his editorship as a modernising new broom, he commented in June 1997 shortly after the election of Tony Blair&#x27;s first New Labour government that the &quot;old&quot; &quot;Guardian&quot;: &quot;opposed lots of things the Tories did which we&#x27;d now think weren&#x27;t terribly bad in retrospect ... I mean, a lot of the trade union stuff doesn&#x27;t seem as horrendous now as it seemed at the time.&quot; From around 1997, he oversaw the launch and development of the newspaper&#x27;s website, initially known as &quot;Guardian Unlimited&quot;.

====Berliner, digital and corporate====
In September 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; responded to the tabloid re-launches of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; by moving from a broadsheet format to the &quot;Berliner&quot; format, which is common in the rest of Europe. The print edition of the newspaper still accounted for about 75% of the company&#x27;s revenue around 2012. In a profile of Rusbridger though, published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; at the end of May 2012, former newspaper editor Peter Wilby cast doubt on whether Rusbridger&#x27;s enthusiasm for online journalism, freely available without a paywall, and the large amount of money invested by the group, would ever gain a return or ensure the long-term survival of the newspaper.

Until May 2016, he was a member of the board of Guardian News and Media, of the main board of the Guardian Media Group and of the Scott Trust, which owns &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;, of which he was executive editor. Rusbridger received £471,000 in pay and benefits in 2008–2009, but then volunteered to a series of pay cuts, bringing his revenue to £395,000 in fiscal year 2012.

He expanded the publishing bases of the paper, opening American and Australian editions.

====Publication of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden material====
As editor-in-chief, in August 2013 Rusbridger took the decision to destroy hard drives containing information leaked to &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Edward Snowden, rather than comply with a government demand to hand over the data. An alternative action was agreed and in the presence of the authorities the drives were destroyed. Rusbridger described performing the task as &quot;slightly pointless&quot;: &quot;Given that there were other copies, I saw no reason not to destroy this material ourselves.&quot; Rather than cease publication of the Snowden material, Rusbridger transferred the editing operation to New York, sharing the material with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He believed that the US First Amendment protection would make it harder for the government to intervene.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The Pulitzer committee praised &quot;The Guardian&quot; for its &quot;revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency, helping through aggressive reporting to spark a debate about the relationship between the government and the public over issues of security and privacy&quot;. Edward Snowden said his actions in leaking the documents that formed the basis of the reporting &quot;would have been meaningless without the dedication, passion, and skill of these newspapers&quot;.

On 3 December 2013, Rusbridger gave evidence before a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing on counterterrorism at the UK Parliament with regard to the publication of information leaked by Snowden. In its report, the Committee said that Rusbridger gave &quot;open and transparent evidence&quot;, while National Security Adviser and MI5 officials declined.

In the film &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; (2013), about &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s former association with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Rusbridger was portrayed by Peter Capaldi. In Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2016 movie, &quot;Snowden&quot;, Rusbridger played a cameo part of a TV interviewer.

====Resignation====

In December 2014, Rusbridger announced he would step down as editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the summer of 2015. On 20 March 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced Katharine Viner as Rusbridger&#x27;s successor.

Rusbridger was to have succeeded Dame Liz Forgan as chair of the Scott Trust in September 2016, but announced on 13 May 2016 that he would not take up the post. The expansion in the later years of Rusbridger&#x27;s editorship led to unsustainable losses and several hundred job cuts were planned. According to a report in &quot;The Times&quot; in April 2016, staff were opposed to Rusbridger returning. Viner and chief executive David Pemsel were also opposed to Rusbridger becoming chair of the Scott Trust.

===Principal of Lady Margaret Hall===
On 17 December 2014, a week after it was published that Rusbridger was stepping down as editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it was announced that Rusbridger had been elected principal of Lady Margaret Hall (LMH), a constituent college of Oxford University. He stepped down as principal in 2021.

==== Foundation Year ====
In January 2016, Rusbridger led Lady Margaret Hall to explore starting a Foundation Year for young people from under-represented backgrounds. It was based on a 20-year project at Trinity College, Dublin. 

Announcing the scheme, Rusbridger wrote: &quot;there are groups of young people today who are markedly under-represented at Oxford, even if it is not quite right to call them &quot;excluded&quot;. They are as bright, resourceful and determined as anyone who has succeeded in getting here, but many things may have conspired to stop them even considering Oxford as an option.&quot;

The move was welcomed by the Vice Chancellor of Oxford, Louise Richardson. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;One of the many advantages of the collegiate system is that it allows us to engage in a small scale pilot like this to help us identify innovative ways to recruit under-represented groups. I wish the programme at Lady Margaret Hall every success.&quot;

The fully funded scheme was launched in October 2016 with the first 10 students, and each year since between 8 and 10 years students have taken part. 

Cambridge University announced it would be starting its own fully-funded Foundation year scheme. The first 42 students were admitted in October 2022. Oxford University announced it would also be starting a Foundation Year, involving 10 colleges, to start in 2023.

==== &quot;The Times&quot; Investigation ====
In April 2022, &quot;The Times&quot; released an investigation into Rusbridger&#x27;s conduct while college Principal. A student said she was made to sign a gagging order contained within a separate agreement by Rusbridger and his administration after she accused another student of sexually assaulting her. Ostensibly outlining precautionary safety arrangements, the agreement also stipulated the student must &quot;not make any information about the allegations, the police investigation or Lady Margaret Hall safeguarding arrangements available to any form of public media&quot; under threat of expulsion from the college. Rusbridger denied it was a gagging order but said the college &quot;asked both parties to refrain from public comment while the case was active&quot;. Once the student sought legal help, she said Rusbridger &quot;tried desperately to convince her not to complain&quot;. The college, under Rusbridger&#x27;s successor, later settled the personal injury claim, paying the student&#x27;s damages and legal costs.

&quot;The Times&quot; article also details the accounts of eight other students whose experiences corroborate that of the original student. Repeated failures are detailed by the students who felt let down by the college&#x27;s welfare and safeguarding systems and the responses of staff to allegations of sexual assault while Rusbridger was Principal.

The-then Acting Principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Christine Gerrard, said &quot;LMH has recognised that there is scope for improvement in our non-academic disciplinary procedures, which includes how the college deals with allegations of sexual assault and harassment. We have established a working party, with external members, which is currently reviewing these procedures&quot; and agreed to become the first Oxford University college to sign the government backed Can&#x27;t Buy My Silence pledge to not use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

In response to the article, the Charity Commission announced it was in urgent contact with the college over its failure, as a registered charity, to make a &quot;serious incident report&quot; when the original assault was reported. Michelle Donelan, then Minister of State for Higher and Further Education, said the college&#x27;s decision was &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; and Lady Margaret Hall should be &quot;ashamed&quot;. 

===Other activities===
He is visiting Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, and visiting professor of history at Queen Mary, University of London. Between 2004 and 2013, he was chair of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. He is a governor of the Ditchley Foundation, an organisation which exists to promote international relations, and 10:10, a British climate change campaign for a 10% reduction in carbon emissions in 2010.

He is an amateur pianist and performed Chopin&#x27;s Ballade No. 1 for the television channel More4 in &quot;Rusbridger vs Chopin&quot;, where he speaks about the difficulties of taking on a piece considered by many professional pianists as daunting.

Rusbridger appears in the 2016 film &quot;Snowden&quot;, with a cameo role as a meeting moderator.

He has written three children&#x27;s books, as well as being the co-author (with Ronan Bennett) of a BBC drama, &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;.

In 2014, he received the Special Award from the European Press Prize for his leading role in the NSA revelations. In 2020, he joined its panel of judges.

On 29 September 2020, the office of the Irish Taoiseach announced that Rusbridger was to be a member of Ireland&#x27;s Future of Media Commission, a body to make recommendations about the future of the country&#x27;s news media. Máiría Cahill called upon Rusbridger to resign from this position because in October 2014 &quot;The Guardian&quot; carried an article critical of her claims to have been a victim of sexual abuse by a former IRA member. The reporter was Roy Greenslade who, at the time, had not acknowledged that he was an IRA supporter who wrote under the pseudonym &#x27;George King&#x27; for the newspaper &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; for many years. Rusbringer said: &quot;I did not read this piece either before or after publication&quot; but his company email address had responded to complaints about the article which Rusbringer said was a &quot;managing editor&quot; acting on his behalf; there was no mention of such an editor in a single email from his address. Rusbridger announced his resignation from the commission on 14 March 2021.

Rusbridger is to be played by Toby Jones in an upcoming ITV drama about the News International phone hacking scandal, &quot;The Hack&quot;, by the team which made &quot;Mr Bates vs The Post Office&quot;.

===Personal life and honours===
In 1982, he married the educationalist Lindsay Mackie, daughter of the politician and farmer George Mackie, Baron Mackie of Benshie. She helped found the educational charity FILMCLUB. They have two daughters: Isabella Rusbridger (born 28 July 1983) and a second daughter (born May 1986). 

Isabella is a journalist and author, known professionally as Bella Mackie to distinguish herself from her father. Her novel &quot;How to Kill Your Family&quot;, released in June 2021, became a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller and sold over a million copies. She is married to BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James.

Rusbridger received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Lincoln in September 2009, from the University of Kingston in January 2010 and from the University of Oslo in September 2014.

He was one of the 2014 recipients of the Right Livelihood Award.

<text>A food processor is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate repetitive tasks in the preparation of food. Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as &quot;food processors&quot;.

Food processors are similar to blenders in many forms. A food processor typically requires little to no liquid during use, and even its finely chopped products retain some texture. A blender, however, requires some liquid for the blade to properly blend the food, and its output is more liquid. Food processors are used to blend, chop, dice, and slice, allowing for quicker meal preparation.

==History==
One of the first electric food processors was the Starmix, introduced by German company Electrostar in 1946. Although the basic unit resembled a simple blender, numerous accessories were available, including attachments for slicing bread, milk centrifuges and ice cream bowls. In a time when electric motors were expensive, they also developed the piccolo, where the food processor&#x27;s base unit could drive a vacuum cleaner. In the 1960s, Albrecht von Goertz designed the Starmix MX3 food processor. Although the entire company was rebranded as Starmix in 1968 following the success of the processors, they later focused on vacuum cleaners and electric hand-dryers and the last mixer was produced around the year 2000. 
In France, the concept of a machine to process food began when a catering company salesman, Pierre Verdun, observed the large amount of time his clients spent in the kitchen chopping, shredding and mixing. He produced a simple but effective solution, a bowl with a revolving blade in the base. In 1960, this evolved into Robot-Coupe, a company established to manufacture commercial &quot;food processors&quot; for the catering industry. In the late 1960s, a commercial food processor driven by a powerful commercial induction motor was produced. Robot-Coupe&#x27;s Magimix food processor arrived from France in the UK in 1974, beginning with the Model 1800. Then, a UK company Kenwood Limited started their own first Kenwood Food Processor, &#x27;processor de- luxe,&#x27; in 1979.

Carl Sontheimer introduced this same Magimix 1800 food processor to North America in 1973 under the Cuisinart brand, as America&#x27;s first domestic food processor. Sontheimer contracted with a Japanese manufacturer to produce new models in 1977 in order to immediately launch his new Japanese-made food processor in 1980 when his contract with Robot-Coupe expired.

=== Marc Harrison&#x27;s Cuisinart Re-design ===
Disability research was an ongoing project because the first food processor created was not user friendly for all individuals. In 1978, Marc Harrison was a professor at the Rhode Island School of Design. He specialized in Industrial Design. Cuisinart, an American company, contacted and hired Harrison in 1978 to update the Food Processor. Harrison updated the product to focus on making the machine usable for those with limited abilities with fine motor skills and eyesight, which in turn made it easier for any user to operate. These updates included larger writing on the base of the product to benefit those who have vision impairments, and larger handles and buttons. These updates were created so that the food processor could be accessible for all users.

==Functions==
Food processors normally have multiple functions, depending on the placement and type of attachment or blade. Some of the more challenging tasks include kneading stiff doughs, chopping raw carrots, and shredding a hard cheese, which may require a more powerful motor. The standard accessory for chopping is called the knife blade or sometimes just blade. They often also come with a shredding and slicing blades. Accessories such as blender and juicer attachments may allow a food processor to perform the duties of other appliances.

==Design and operation==

The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft. Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a &quot;feed tube&quot; is then fitted onto the bowl.

The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping or slicing. It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to shredding or slicing disks. A &quot;pusher&quot; is provided, sized to slide through the feed tube, protecting the user&#x27;s fingers.

Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the motor from operating if the bowl is not properly secured to the base or if the lid is not properly secured to the bowl.

== Variations ==
A food chopper is basically a food processor of a smaller size. It is also better suited for chopping food than making smoothies.

<text>A tercio (), Spanish for &quot;[a] third&quot;) was a military unit of the Spanish Army during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and Habsburg Spain in the early modern period. They were the elite military units of the Spanish monarchy and the essential pieces of the powerful land forces of the Spanish Empire, sometimes also fighting with the navy.

The Spanish &quot;tercios&quot; were one of the finest professional infantries in the world due to the effectiveness of their battlefield formations and were a crucial step in the formation of modern European armies, made up of professional volunteers, instead of levies raised for a campaign or hired mercenaries typically used by other European countries of the time.

The internal administrative organization of the &quot;tercios&quot; and their battlefield formations and tactics, grew out of the innovations of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba during the conquest of Granada and the Italian Wars in the 1490s and 1500s, being among the first to effectively mix pikes and firearms (arquebuses). The &quot;tercios&quot; marked a rebirth of battlefield infantry comparable to the Macedonian phalanxes and the Roman legions. Such formations distinguished themselves in famous battles such as the Battle of Bicocca (1522) and the Battle of Pavia (1525). Following their formal establishment in 1534, the reputation of the &quot;tercio&quot; was built upon their effective training and high proportion of &quot;old soldiers&quot; (&quot;veteranos&quot;), in conjunction with the particular elan imparted by the lower nobility who commanded them. The &quot;tercios&quot; were finally replaced by regiments in the early eighteenth century.
From 1920, the name of &quot;tercio&quot; was given to the formations of the newly created Spanish Legion; professional units then created to fight colonial wars in North Africa, similar to the French Foreign Legion. These formations are actually regiments bearing the name of &quot;tercio&quot; as an honorary title.

==History==

During the Granada War (1482–1491), the soldiers of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain were divided into three classes: pikemen (modelled after the Swiss), swordsmen with shields, and crossbowmen supplemented with an early firearm the arquebus. As shields disappeared and firearms replaced crossbows, Spain won victory after victory in Italy against powerful French armies, beginning under the leadership of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (1453–1515), nicknamed &quot;El Gran Capitán&quot; (&quot;The Great Captain&quot;) The military organizational and tactical changes made by Córdoba to the armies of Spanish monarchs are seen as the precursors of the tercios and their methods of warfare. The combat effectiveness of the Spanish pike and shot armies pioneered by Córdoba was based on an armament system that effectively united the pike with the compact firepower of the arquebus. An advantage of the Spanish pike and shot formation over the Swiss compact frame that had inspired it was in its ability to divide into mobile units and even individual melee without the loss of cohesion.

Initially, the term &quot;tercio&quot; denoted not a combat unit, but an administrative unit under a general staff, commanding garrisons throughout Italy for battles on various distant fronts. This peculiar character was maintained when it mobilized to fight the Protestant rebels in Flanders. Command of a tercio and its companies of soldiers was granted directly by the king, and companies could easily be added or removed and moved to and from other tercios. By the middle of the 17th century, the tercios began to be raised by nobles at their own expense, patrons who appointed the captains and were effective owners of the units, as in other contemporaneous European armies.

From the conquest of Granada in 1492 to the campaigns of &quot;El Gran Capitán&quot; in the kingdom of Naples in 1495, three ordinances laid the foundations of Spanish military administration. In 1503, the &quot;Great Ordinance&quot; reflected the adoption of the long pike and the distribution of infantry in specialized companies. In 1534, the first official tercio was created, that of Lombardy, and a year later it helped in the conquest of the Duchy of Milan. The tercios of Naples and Sicily were created in 1536, thanks to the Genoa ordinance of Charles V.

At the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, the imperial troops of Charles V defeated a league of Protestant princes in Germany, thanks mainly to the action of the Spanish tercios. In 1557, the Spanish army completely defeated the French at the Battle of San Quentin, and again in 1558 at Gravelines, which led to a peace greatly favoring Spain. In all these battles, the effectiveness of the tercio units stood out.

The origin of the term &quot;tercio&quot; is doubtful. Some historians believe the name was inspired by the &quot;tercía&quot;, a Roman Legion of Hispania. Some think that it designated the threefold division of the Spanish forces in Italy. Others trace it to the three types of combatants (pikemen, harquebusiers, musketeers). According to an ordinance for &quot;people of war&quot; of 1497, where the formation of the infantry is changed into three parts.
The pawns [the infantry] were divided into three parts. The one tercio with spears, as the Germans brought them, which they called pikes; and the other had the name of shields [people of swords]; and the other, of crossbowmen and spit bearers. [later replaced by arquebusiers].

Yet others derive the name from the three thousand men mustered in the first units. This last explanation is supported by the field master Sancho de Londoño in a report to the Duke of Alba in the 16th century:
The tercios, although they were instituted in imitation of the [Roman] legions, in few things can be compared to them, that the number is half, and although formerly there were three thousand soldiers, for which they were called tercios and not legions, already it is said like this even if they do not have more than a thousand men.

==Composition and characteristics==
Although other powers adopted the battle formations and tactics perfected by the tercios, their armies fell short of the fearsome reputation of the Spanish army, which possessed a core of experienced professional soldiers. This army was further supplemented by &quot;an army of different nations&quot;, a reference to the varied origins of the troops from the German and Italian states and the Spanish Netherlands and smaller units from other countries such as Ireland. In 1621, for example, of the 47 military units of the Spanish army, counting together the larger Spanish, Spanish Netherlands and Italian tercios, and the much smaller German, Burgundian and Irish regiments, Only seven were manned by troops of Spanish origin. Such international musters were characteristic of European warfare before the levies of the Napoleonic Wars. However, the core Spanish troops were Spanish subjects, admired for their cohesiveness, superior discipline and overall professionalism.

=== Organization ===
Initially, each tercio that served in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands was organized into:

* 10 companies of 300 soldiers each led by captains, in which
** 8 were pikemen&#x27;s companies and
** 2 were of arquebusier companies

The companies were later reduced to 250 men and the ratio of arquebusiers (later musketmen) to pikemen steadily increased.

During the early actions in the Netherlands, the tercios were reorganized into three &quot;coronelias&quot; (&quot;colonelcies&quot;), led by &quot;coronels&quot; (&quot;colonels&quot;) each composed of a headquarters unit and four companies each (the predecessor of today&#x27;s battalions), but as a whole continued to be subdivided into the same 10 companies of 250 personnel each: two of arquebusiers and 8 of pikemen. Colonels were also of royal appointment.

=== Staff ===
* &quot;Maestre de Campo&quot; – colonel 
* &quot;Coronel&quot; – colonel/lieutenant colonel
* &quot;Sargento mayor&quot; – major
* &quot;Furriel mayor&quot; – quartermaster
* &quot;Capellán mayor&quot; – chaplain
* &quot;Pifano mayor&quot; – fife major
* &quot;Tambor mayor&quot; – drum major

=== Company ===
* 1 &quot;Capitán&quot; – captain
* 1 &quot;Alférez&quot; – lieutenant
* &quot;Abanderado&quot; – standard-bearer
* &quot;Sargento&quot; – sergeant
* &quot;Capellán&quot; – chaplain
* &quot;Furriel&quot; – quartermaster
* &quot;Tambor&quot; – drummer
* &quot;Pifano&quot; – fifer
* &quot;Barbero&quot; – barber surgeon
* &quot;Cabos de escuadra&quot; – corporals
* 150 &quot;piqueros&quot; – pikemen
* 100 &quot;arcabuceros&quot; – arquebusiers (later musketeers)
* 40 &quot;coseletes&quot; – sword-and-buckler men

=== Leadership of the tercio ===
Similar to military organization today, a tercio was led by a maestre de campo (commanding officer) appointed by the king, with a guard of eight halberdiers. Assisting the maestre was the sergeant major and a furir major in charge of logistics and armaments. Companies were led by a captain (also royally appointed), with an ensign in charge of the company color.

The company non-commissioned officers were sergeants, furrieles (furirs) and corporals. A sergeant served as second-in-command of a company and transmitted the captain&#x27;s orders; furrieles provided weapons and munitions, as well as additional manpower; corporals led groups of 25 (similar to today&#x27;s platoons), watching for disorder in the unit.

Each company had corps of drums made up of drummers and fifers, sounding duty calls in battle, with the drum major and fife major being provided by the &quot;tercio&quot; headquarters.

The tercio staff included a medical component (made up of a professional medic, a barber, and surgeons), chaplains and preachers, and a judicial unit, plus military constables enforcing order. They all reported directly to the maestre de campo.

===Battle formations===

Within a tercio&#x27;s squares, ranks of pikemen assembled into a hollow pike square (&quot;cuadro&quot;) containing swordsmen – typically with short sword, buckler, and javelins. As firearms rose in prominence, the swordsmen were phased out. The arquebusiers (later, musketeers) were usually split up in several mobile groups called &quot;sleeves&quot; (&quot;mangas&quot;), typically deployed with one &quot;manga&quot; at each corner of the &quot;cuadro&quot;. By virtue of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed the staying power of its pike-armed infantry, the ranged firepower of its arquebusiers, and the striking power of its sword-and-buckler men. However, as the formation matured in practice, the number of swordsmen was reduced and then eliminated and the ratio of gunmen to pikemen increased over time. In addition to its defensive ability to repulse cavalry and other forces along its front, the long-range fire of its arquebusiers could be easily shifted to the flanks, making it versatile in both attack and defense.
Groups of squares were typically arrayed in dragon-toothed formation, staggered, with the leading edge of one unit level with the trailing edge of the preceding, similar to hedgehog defence. This enabled enfilade lines of fire and somewhat defiladed the army units themselves. Odd units stood forward, alternating with even units stepped back, providing gaps for an unwary enemy to enter and expose its flanks to raking crossfire from the guns of three separate squares. Tercio companies also conducted particular operations independently of the main formations.

===Tercios and the Spanish Empire===
Tercios were deployed all over Europe under the Habsburg rulers. They were made up of volunteers and built up around a core of professional soldiers and were highly trained. Sometimes later &quot;tercios&quot; did not stick to the all-volunteer model of the regular Imperial Spanish army – when the Habsburg king Philip II found himself in need of more troops, he raised a tercio of Catalan criminals to fight in Flanders, a trend he continued with mostly Catalan criminals for the rest of his reign. A large proportion of the Spanish army (which by the later half of the 16th century was entirely composed of tercio units: The Tercio of Savoy and the Tercio of Sicily were deployed in the Netherlands to quell the increasingly difficult rebellion against the Habsburgs. Ironically, many units of the Spanish tercios became part of the problem rather than the solution when the time came to pay them: with the Spanish coffers depleted by constant warfare, unpaid units often mutinied. For example, in April 1576, just after winning a major victory, unpaid tercios mutinied and occupied the friendly town of Antwerp, in the so-called Spanish Fury at Antwerp, and sacked it for three days. Completely reliant on his troops, the Spanish commander could only comply.

===Specialized tercios===
On 24 February 1537, the &quot;Tercio de Galeras&quot; (&quot;Tercio&quot; of Galleys) was created. Today, the &quot;Real Infantería de Marina&quot; (Spanish Marine Infantry) consider themselves successors of the legacy and heritage of the Galleys Tercios making it the oldest currently operating marines unit in the world. There were other units of naval &quot;tercios&quot; such as &quot;Tercio Viejo de Armada&quot; (Old Navy Tercio) or &quot;Tercio Fijo de la Mar de Nápoles&quot; (Permanent Sea Tercio of Naples). Such specialized units were needed for the protracted war with the Ottoman Empire over the entire Mediterranean.

===Naming conventions===
Most tercios were named according to the place where they were raised or first deployed: thus they were &quot;Tercio de Sicilia&quot;, &quot;de Lombardía&quot;, &quot;de Nápoles&quot; (Tercio of Sicily, of Lombardy, of Naples) and so on. Other tercios were named for their commanding officer, such as &quot;Tercio de Moncada&quot; for its commander Miguel de Moncada (whose most famous soldier was Miguel de Cervantes). Some tercios were named by their main function, such as &quot;Galeras&quot; or &quot;Viejo de Armada&quot;.

==The Portuguese &quot;terços&quot;==

Portugal adopted the Spanish model of &quot;tercio&quot; in the 16th century, calling it terço. In 1578, under the reorganization of the Portuguese Army conducted by King Sebastian, four &quot;terços&quot; were established: the &quot;Terço&quot; of Lisbon, the &quot;Terço&quot; of Estremadura, the Terço of Alentejo, and the Terço of Algarve. Each had about 2,000 men, formed into eight companies.

The infantry of the army organized for the expedition to Morocco in 1578 was made up of these four terços together with the Terço of the Adventurers (totally made up of young nobles), three mercenary terços (the German, the Italian, and the Castilian), and a unit of elite sharpshooters of the Portuguese garrison of Tangier. This was the Portuguese force which fought the Battle of Alcácer Quibir.

While united with the Spanish Crown, from 1580 to 1640, Portugal kept the organization of &quot;terços&quot;, although the Army had declined. Several Spanish &quot;tercios&quot; were sent to Portugal; the principal of them, the Spanish infantry &quot;Tercio&quot; of the City of Lisbon, occupied the main fortresses of the Portuguese capital. The &quot;Terço&quot; of the Navy of the Crown of Portugal, the ancestor of the modern Portuguese Marines, was created in this period.

After the restoration of Portuguese sovereignty in 1640, the Army was reorganized by King John IV of Portugal. The terços remained the basic units of the Portuguese infantry. Two types of terços were organized: the paid terços (first line permanent units) and the auxiliary terços (second line militia units). Portugal won the Restoration War with these terços.

At the end of the 17th century, the terços were already organized as modern regiments. However, the first line terços were only transformed into regiments in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession – after the Spanish tercios were transformed into regiments in 1704. The second line terços were only transformed into militia regiments in 1796. Some of the old terços are direct ancestors of modern regiments of the Portuguese Army.

==Evolution and replacement==
The first real challenge to the dominance of the Spanish tercios on the open battlefield came at the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600). The victor of Nieuwpoort, the Dutch stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange, believed he could improve on the &quot;tercio&quot; by combining its methods with the organisation of the Roman legion. These shallower linear formations brought a greater proportion of available guns to bear on the enemy simultaneously. The result was that the tercio squares at Nieuwpoort were badly damaged by the weight of Dutch firepower. Yet the Spanish army very nearly succeeded in spite of internal dissensions that had compromised its regular command. The Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) in the Low Countries continued to be characterized by sieges of cities and forts, while field battles were of secondary importance. Maurice&#x27;s reforms did not lead to a revolution in warfare, but he had created an army that could meet the tercios&#x27; battle formations on an even basis and that pointed the way to future developments. During the Thirty Years War (1618–1648) tercio style battle formations of the Holy Roman Empire suffered major defeats at the hands of more linear formations created and led by the Swedish soldier-king Gustavus Adolphus. However, the tried-and-true tactics and professionalism of the Spanish tercios played a decisive role in defeating the Swedish army at the Battle of Nördlingen.

Throughout its history, the tercios&#x27; composition and battlefield formations and tactics evolved to meet new challenges. The classic pike and shot square formations fielded by the Spanish tercios and good cavalry support continued to win major battles in the 17th century, such as Wimpfen (1622), Fleurus (1622), Breda (1624), Nördlingen (1634), Thionville (1639), and Honnecourt (1641). It was not until Rocroi (1643) that the Spanish tercio&#x27;s reputation of invincibility in open battle was shattered. Still, the Rocroi defeat was precipitated by the collapse of the supporting cavalry rather than the failure of the tercios&#x27; infantry. Even then, the tercios continued to win battles immediately after Rocroi, such as at Tuttlingen (1643) and Valenciennes (1656), although their composition and battlefield style had continued to evolve. In this period steady improvements in firearms and field artillery were increasingly favoring the linear style. By the late 17th century the tercios had adopted so much of the linear style that their battlefield formations and tactics often had little resemblance to the battle formations and tactics a century earlier.

=== Royal Military and Mathematics Academy of Brussels ===
In 1675 the first modern Royal Military and Mathematics Academy of Brussels was founded in Brussels by its sole-director Don Sebastián Fernández de Medrano, at the request of the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, Carlos de Aragón de Gurrea, 9th Duke of Villahermosa, in order to correct the shortage of artillerymen and engineers from the Spanish Tercios.

This Royal Military and Mathematics Academy in Flanders was renowned for the diverse origin of its officer cadets, for the innovative features of its plan of studies produced by Sebastián Fernández de Medrano, the theoretical and practical basis of its learning process apart from the relevant assignments given to its officer cadets who were also known as the “Great Masters of War” coined by the treatise writer, Count of Clonard. It was created in Brussels to train the most distinguished officers in the peninsula in the Art of War.

The Royal Military Academy of Flanders was an educational institution to train military engineers with various fields of education such as arithmetic, geometry, artillery, fortification, algebra, cosmography, astronomy, navigation, etc.

=== Transformation of the Spanish Tercio ===
In 1704, the regular Spanish tercios were transformed into regiments and the pikeman as an infantry type was dropped. Those of the reserves and the militia would later be transformed into similar organisations.
