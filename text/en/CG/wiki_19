<text>Lü Buwei (291–235 BCE) was a Chinese merchant and politician of the Qin state during the Warring States period. Originally an influential merchant from the Wey () state, Lü Buwei met and befriended King Zhuangxiang of Qin, who was then a minor prince serving as a hostage in the Zhao state. Through bribes and machinations, Lü Buwei succeeded in helping King Zhuangxiang become the heir apparent to the Qin throne. In 249 BCE, after King Zhuangxiang ascended the throne following the death of his father, King Xiaowen, he appointed Lü Buwei as his chancellor () and ennobled him as &quot;Marquis Wenxin&quot; (). After King Zhuangxiang&#x27;s death in 247 BCE, Lü Buwei became the chancellor and regent to King Zhuangxiang&#x27;s young son, Ying Zheng, who later became Qin Shi Huang (First Emperor of the Qin dynasty).

In 235 BCE, after being implicated in a scandal involving the Queen Dowager Zhao (Ying Zheng&#x27;s mother) and her illicit lover Lao Ai, Lü Buwei was stripped of his posts and titles and was banished to the remote Shu region in the south of Qin. While in exile, Lü Buwei committed suicide by consuming poison.

Apart from his political career, Lü Buwei is also known for sponsoring the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, an encyclopaedic compendium of the ideas of the Hundred Schools of Thought that was published in 239 BCE.

==Life==

The primary sources of information about Lü Buwei date from the first century BCE: Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; (&quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;), and Liu Xiang&#x27;s &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; (&quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;) and &quot;Shuoyuan&quot; (, &quot;Garden of Stories&quot;). Since these three Han dynasty texts openly criticise both Lü Buwei and the Qin dynasty, some alleged stories (for example, Lü&#x27;s private thoughts and conversations) can be discounted. Note that some of the following English translations come from John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel&#x27;s scholarly study of the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;.

Lü Buwei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Shiji&quot; mentioned that he was from the Wey state and he became a successful travelling merchant earning &quot;thousands of measures of gold&quot;. In 267 BCE, the first son of King Zhaoxiang of the Qin state died, so King Zhaoxiang named his second son, Lord Anguo, as his new heir apparent. Lord Anguo promoted his concubine, Lady Huayang (), who was childless, to the status of his primary spouse. Lord Anguo had over twenty sons. Among them, Yiren, who ranked somewhere in the middle in terms of age, was sent to the Zhao state to serve as a royal hostage. When Lü Buwei was trading in Handan, the capital of Zhao, he met Yiren and said, &quot;This is a rare piece of merchandise that should be saved for later.&quot;

The &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot; recorded a story about Lü Buwei deciding to switch his career from business to politics.

Using bribes and machinations, Lü Buwei arranged for Yiren to return to Qin and successfully persuaded Lady Huayang to adopt Yiren as her son, thereby making Yiren the heir apparent to Lord Anguo. Lady Huayang renamed Yiren to &quot;Zichu&quot; (; &quot;son of Chu&quot;) because she was from the Chu state.

The &quot;Shiji&quot; mentioned that Lü Buwei had a beautiful &quot;dancing girl&quot;, Lady Zhao, in his household, with whom Zichu became so infatuated that he asked for her. Lü Buwei reluctantly presented Lady Zhao to Zichu, and they returned to Handan. In 259 BCE, Lady Zhao gave birth to a son, Ying Zheng, who eventually unified China under the Qin dynasty and became historically known as &quot;Qin Shi Huang&quot; (First Emperor of Qin). After the death of King Zhaoxiang in 251 BCE, Lord Anguo was enthroned and became historically known as &quot;King Xiaowen&quot;, but he died three days after his coronation in 250 BCE. Zichu succeeded his father and became historically known as &quot;King Zhuangxiang&quot;. King Zhuangxiang appointed Lü Buwei as his chancellor (; or prime minister) and enfeoffed him as &quot;Marquis Wenxin&quot; () with a taxable fief covering 100,000 households in Luoyang. While in office, Lü Buwei oversaw Qin&#x27;s military campaigns against neighboring states. When King Zhuangxiang died in 247 BCE, a 13-year-old Ying Zheng succeeded him, while Lü Buwei continued serving as a chancellor () and regent to the young king.

As the chancellor and regent, Lü Buwei dominated the Qin government and military. He invited famous scholars from all over China to Xianyang, the Qin capital, where they compiled the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; (&quot;Lü&#x27;s Spring and Autumn [Annals]&quot;), an encyclopedic compendium of the ideas of the Hundred Schools of Thought.

The &quot;Shiji&quot; says that Lady Zhao (who became the Queen Dowager after Ying Zheng ascended the throne) pursued many illicit sexual activities, and Lü Buwei,

The Queen Dowager fell in love with Lao Ai and had him enfeoffed as the &quot;Marquis Changxin&quot;. After she became pregnant, he recklessly took control of the Qin government.

The &quot;Shuoyuan&quot; mentioned:

Ying Zheng learnt that Lao Ai was not really a eunuch, and had plotted with the Queen Dowager to make their illegitimate son become successor. In 238 BCE, Lao Ai launched a revolt in an attempt to seize power from Ying Zheng, but the rebellion was crushed and Lao Ai was executed along with three generations of his relatives. Ying Zheng stripped his mother of her position as the Queen Dowager and ordered the two sons she secretly had with Lao Ai to be put into sacks and beaten to death. Lü Buwei was implicated in the incident and was stripped of his posts and titles and banished to the remote Shu region in the south of Qin. Lü Buwei feared eventual execution so he committed suicide in 235 BCE by consuming poison. As a result of the Lao Ai affair, Ying Zheng removed power from most of Lü Buwei&#x27;s retainers and followers (one notable exception being Li Si) and restored it to the hereditary Qin aristocracy. After Lü Buwei&#x27;s death, the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; fell out of favour with the Qin government, but was resurrected by the Han dynasty later.

Knoblock and Riegel describe the Western and Chinese historical perspectives of Lü Buwei as follows:
==In popular culture==
* Lü Buwei is a major character in the 1999 Chinese film &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot;, which focuses on the events just before the unification of China by Qin Shi Huang. The true nature of the relationship between the Emperor and Lü Buwei is a major plot point in the story.
* Lü Buwei is played by Kwok Fung in the 2001 Hong Kong television series &quot;A Step into the Past&quot;, which is based on a novel by Huang Yi. In the series, Ying Zheng is Lü Buwei&#x27;s biological son, but the revelation is that Ying Zheng had already died in his youth. A young man called Zhao Pan takes on Ying Zheng&#x27;s identity and, with the help of Xiang Shaolong (a 21st-century Hong Kong policeman who travelled back in time), knocks Lü Buwei out of power. Zhao Pan reveals his true identity to a shocked Lü Buwei later and kills him.
* Lü Buwei is a major character in the historical novel series &quot;The Jade Disk&quot; by José Frèches.
* The story of Lü Buwei is retold in graphic form, partly framed as a romance comic, in the second volume of &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot;.
* Hermann Hesse mentions Lü Buwei in his book &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; as a character that mentions that the quality of the music is directly related to the sense of life that one has.
* Lü Buwei is a character and one of primary antagonists in the Japanese manga &quot;Kingdom&quot;. The manga and its anime adoption does not deviate heavily from the classical historical portrayal of Lü Buwei, depicting him as a malevolent schemer who aligns himself with his former lover, the Queen Dowager, in order to usurp the throne of Qin, under the guise of helping Ying Zheng. Also, his creation of Lushi Chunqiu was seen too, challenging commoners to change anything on that collection, in exchange of rewards. And he is known to be too rich, he even threw a lavish banquet, including elephants that Lu himself described as a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot;. His motive for abandoning Ying for a campaign is for Zhao Chengjiao to usurp the throne and eliminate him when the time comes. This failed, and he was implicated in Lao Ai&#x27;s rebellion, stripped of everything he has and exiled to Shu. He committed &quot;suicide&quot;, but a mysterious carriage leaves the area he was exiled in with dialogue indicating its occupant wished to observe the world that Ying would create as the latter seeks to unify China.
* Lü Buwei appears in the Chinese television series &quot;The King&#x27;s Woman&quot; as a true father of Ying Zheng.
* Lü Buwei is portrayed by Nie Yuan in &quot;The Legend of Haolan&quot; (2019).
* Lü Buwei is portrayed by Duan Yihong in Qin Dynasty Epic (2020).

<doc id="979374" wikidata="Q1083626" url="?curid=979374" title="Orbital inclination change">
<text>Orbital inclination change is an orbital maneuver aimed at changing the inclination of an orbiting body&#x27;s orbit. This maneuver is also known as an orbital plane change as the plane of the orbit is tipped. This maneuver requires a change in the orbital velocity vector (delta-v) at the orbital nodes (i.e. the point where the initial and desired orbits intersect, the line of orbital nodes is defined by the intersection of the two orbital planes).

In general, inclination changes can take a very large amount of delta-v to perform, and most mission planners try to avoid them whenever possible to conserve fuel. This is typically achieved by launching a spacecraft directly into the desired inclination, or as close to it as possible so as to minimize any inclination change required over the duration of the spacecraft life. Planetary flybys are the most efficient way to achieve large inclination changes, but they are only effective for interplanetary missions.

== Efficiency ==
The simplest way to perform a plane change is to perform a burn around one of the two crossing points of the initial and final planes. The delta-v required is the vector change in velocity between the two planes at that point.

However, maximum efficiency of inclination changes are achieved at apoapsis, (or apogee), where orbital velocity formula_1 is the lowest. In some cases, it can require less total delta-v to raise the satellite into a higher orbit, change the orbit plane at the higher apogee, and then lower the satellite to its original altitude.

For the most efficient example mentioned above, targeting an inclination at apoapsis also changes the argument of periapsis. However, targeting in this manner limits the mission designer to changing the plane only along the line of apsides.

For Hohmann transfer orbits, the initial orbit and the final orbit are 180 degrees apart. Because the transfer orbital plane has to include the central body, such as the Sun, and the initial and final nodes, this can require two 90 degree plane changes to reach and leave the transfer plane. In such cases it is often more efficient to use a &quot;broken plane maneuver&quot; where an additional burn is done so that plane change only occurs at the intersection of the initial and final orbital planes, rather than at the ends.

== Inclination entangled with other orbital elements ==
An important subtlety of performing an inclination change is that Keplerian orbital inclination is defined by the angle between ecliptic North and the vector normal to the orbit plane, (i.e. the angular momentum vector). This means that inclination is always positive and is entangled with other orbital elements primarily the argument of periapsis which is in turn connected to the longitude of the ascending node. This can result in two very different orbits with precisely the same inclination.

== Calculation ==
In a pure inclination change, only the inclination of the orbit is changed while all other orbital characteristics (radius, shape, etc.) remains the same as before. Delta-v (formula_2) required for an inclination change (formula_3) can be calculated as follows:
formula_4
where:
*formula_5 is the orbital eccentricity
*formula_6 is the argument of periapsis
*formula_7 is the true anomaly
*formula_8 is the mean motion
*formula_9 is the semi-major axis

For more complicated maneuvers which may involve a combination of change in inclination and orbital radius, the delta-v is the vector difference between the velocity vectors of the initial orbit and the desired orbit at the transfer point. These types of combined maneuvers are commonplace, as it is more efficient to perform multiple orbital maneuvers at the same time if these maneuvers have to be done at the same location.

According to the law of cosines, the minimum Delta-v (formula_10) required for any such combined maneuver can be calculated with the following equation 
formula_11

Here formula_12 and formula_13 are the initial and target velocities.

== Circular orbit inclination change ==

Where both orbits are circular (i.e. formula_14) and have the same radius the Delta-v (formula_2) required for an inclination change (formula_3) can be calculated using:
formula_17
where formula_1 is the orbital velocity and has the same units as formula_2.

== Other ways to change inclination ==
Some other ways to change inclination that do not require burning propellant (or help reduce the amount of propellant required) include
* aerodynamic lift (for bodies within an atmosphere, such as the Earth)
* solar sails

Transits of other bodies such as the Moon can also be done.

None of these methods will change the delta-V required, they are simply alternate means of achieving the same end result and, ideally, will reduce propellant usage.

<doc id="979407" wikidata="Q3355572" url="?curid=979407" title="Battle of Midway order of battle">
<text>This is the order of battle for the [[Battle of Midway]], a major engagement of the Pacific Theatre of World War II, fought 4–7 June 1942 by naval and air forces of Imperial Japan and the United States in the waters around Midway Atoll in the far northwestern Hawaiian Islands. 

The Japanese had two purposes for the campaign: to occupy Midway for use as a base for long-range search planes (for which the Americans were already using it), and to draw the US Pacific Fleet out of its base at Pearl Harbor for a decisive showdown battle. 

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet (comprising all combat vessels) and mastermind of the Pearl Harbor Attack, was tasked with drawing up the operational plan. The Japanese Naval General Staff, responsible for strategic planning, required him to include a diversionary move as part of his detailed battle plan; they told him to include a side operation that would result in the capture of two islands in the Aleutians chain, believing that the occupation of even a tiny portion of a US possession would be sufficient to draw out the bulk of the Pacific Fleet.

US Navy code-breaking, Japanese overconfidence and the courage of American carrier fliers combined to create both a strategic and a tactical defeat for the Japanese: they failed to capture Midway and they suffered much greater losses in ships and planes than did the Americans (the loss of experienced naval pilots would prove to be particularly costly as the war dragged on). Midway put an end to Japanese expansion in the Pacific.

Because the Japanese assumed the tactical initiative, their forces are listed first.

The only significant combat, both offensive and defensive, was experienced by Nagumo&#x27;s First Striking Force. Kurita&#x27;s transports were bombed with limited success by B-17s of the US Army Air Corps, but the vast majority Japanese ships saw no action during the entire Midway campaign.

<text>Caulfield Racecourse is one of Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s best-known horse-racing tracks. Commonly known as &quot;The Heath&quot; by local racegoers, It is home to the Melbourne Racing Club.

Horse-racing started there in 1859 on a bush track where the Melbourne Hunt Club met. A racecourse was then laid out on the site of the club&#x27;s dog kennels. The Victoria Amateur Turf Club was then established in 1876 and the first Caulfield Cup race was run in 1879.

The track has a triangular-shaped layout, comprising three straights, wide, with a total circumference of and a finishing straight of . All turns have a 4% to 6% banking. Racing takes place in an anti-clockwise direction. The totally glassed in Rupert Clarke stand provides an uninterrupted view of the racecourse.

Caulfield has about 25 race days each season and hosts some of the Australia&#x27;s most famous and historic races including the Caulfield Cup, Caulfield Guineas, Blue Diamond Stakes, C F Orr Stakes, Oakleigh Plate, Underwood Stakes and Futurity Stakes.

Caulfield Racecourse Reserve is located nine kilometres from the Melbourne CBD, on the boundary of Caulfield and Caulfield East in Melbourne&#x27;s south eastern suburbs. The Reserve was set aside for three purposes, racing, recreation and a public park. The &quot;Caulfield Racecourse Reserve&quot; Act 2017, established a Trust to plan for the future of the reserve, develop and maintain the reserve.

The Trust reports publicly on its activities through an annual report which is reported to the Victorian Parliament and available on the Trust&#x27;s web page.

The Land Management Plan sets a bold vision for the future of the Reserve as a place for everyone is also available on the Trust&#x27;s web page.

==Transport==
The reserve is on Melbourne tram route 3 and the journey takes about 35 minutes from the city centre.

Caulfield railway station is less than a hundred metres from the racecourse and is located on the Frankston, Cranbourne and Pakenham lines. Trains depart every 10 minutes from Flinders Street station in the Melbourne CBD.

Caulfield Racecourse provides disabled carparks opposite the main entrance on Station Street. Lift access to grandstands and disabled toilets is available. There is also a baby change room and first aid facilities.

==Reconstruction==
After the 1995 Caulfield Cup, the track had major reconstruction of the course proper and re-opened in April 1996.

The track was widened to around the entire circumference and the straight lengthened by . The new racing surface has been cambered from the outside running rail with the crown of the track at the outside running rail. The banking on the turn into the home straight is 4 percent, while the other turns have an equivalent banking of 2 percent.

Further to the major works in 1996, the Caulfield track was re-laid in 2005 immediately preceding the Caulfield Cup Carnival and resumed racing for the Summer Classics Carnival, in February 2006.

==Races==

The following is a list of Group races which are run at Caulfield Racecourse.

==Examinations==
Aside from its use for racing, the Caulfield Racecourse is also used by the VCAA to examine students who are unable to attend examinations at their schools as well as by Open Universities Australia (OUA) and its universities for the end of the study period examinations. The facility is also used for end of semester examinations by universities such as Monash University. The UMAT is also held at Caulfield Racecourse.

<text>The Egypt–Libya Campaign is the name used by the United States military for the US contribution to the Allied Western Desert Campaign, during World War II. From 1942, U.S. forces assisted the British Empire in fighting Axis forces in Egypt and Libya. The U.S. Egypt–Libya Campaign was part of what the US military called the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.

==Air Force Operations==
In June 1942 the United States Army Forces in the Middle East (USAFIME) was created to replace both the North African Mission in Cairo and the Iranian Mission in the Persian Corridor. On June 16 the War Department named Army General Russell L. Maxwell as the first commander of USAFIME. An Army general, rather than an Army Air Corps general, was named because at the time it was still expected that there would be a large U.S. Army land force contribution to the campaign. The next day the War Department informed Maxwell that the Halverson Detachment would remain in Egypt as a part of USAFIME.

In anticipation of the arrival of the American air groups, the War Department sent Maj. Gen. Lewis H Brereton, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force in India, to Cairo for temporary duty to assist the Commonwealth forces. He arrived in Cairo on June 25, along with nine B-17 Flying Fortresses.

On June 30, Brereton had directed the B-17s which he had brought from India to move their operations to Palestine. The B-24s of the Halverson Detachment joined them at Lydda, Palestine. Both units flew day and night bombing missions against the Axis&#x27; increasingly inadequate supply lines, concentrating their efforts against the port of Tobruk.

The heavy bombers of the Brereton and Halverson detachments (now combined into the 1st Provisional Group under Halverson&#x27;s command) had been flying with the Commonwealth air forces for some time, and drawing on that experience, the 98th Bombardment Group (Heavy) which arrived in mid-August, was able to go directly into action. The 1st Provisional Group provided the nucleus of the 376th Bomb Group in October, 1942.

When the 12th Bombardment Group (Medium) and the 57th Fighter Group arrived in the theater of operations, they entered a highly cooperative type of air warfare in an unfamiliar desert environment. Initially, they were integrated into comparable RAF formations, allowing them to observe firsthand the complex techniques of air-ground coordination that the Commonwealth forces had developed during their years of fighting in the Western Desert.

To co-ordinate the growing American presence the US Army Middle East Air Force had established the IX Bomber Command and IX Fighter Command.

In November, Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews assumed command of USAFIME, replacing Maxwell. Andrews was an experienced airman, and one of his first acts was to establish the Ninth Air Force to replace USAMEAF. Brereton assumed command of the new organization and established the IX Air Service Command, which joined the &quot;IX Bomber Command&quot; and the &quot;IX Fighter Command&quot; as the major subordinate headquarters. The 376th Bombardment Group, originally organized to support Soviet forces, became part of the IX Bomber Command and flew its first combat missions over the deserts of North Africa.

The U.S. Army&#x27;s Egypt–Libya Campaign ended on 12 February 1943, when the Allied forces finally succeeded in driving all Axis forces out of Libya.

<doc id="979427" wikidata="Q4053792" url="?curid=979427" title="Yose">
<text>Yose (Japanese: 寄席) is a form of spoken vaudeville theatre of Japan cultivated since the 18th century. The term also refers to the exclusive theater where &quot;yose&quot; is held.

== History ==
The &quot;yose&quot; was a popular form of spoken theatre in the Edo period. The term is the shortened form of &quot;Hito yose seki&quot; (人寄せ席), roughly &quot;Where people sit together&quot;. Towards the end of the Edo period, there were several hundred theatres, about one per district (町, &quot;chō&quot;). The entrance fee, the &quot;wooden door penny&quot; (木戸銭, &quot;Kido-zeni&quot;), was small.

A number of variants existed:
* &quot;Narrative stories&quot; (講談, &quot;Kōdan&quot;)
* &quot;Emotional stories&quot; (人情噺, &quot;Ninjō-banashi&quot;)
* &quot;Comic stories&quot; (落語, &quot;Rakugo&quot;)
* &quot;Magic Arts&quot; (手品, &quot;Tejina&quot;)
* &quot;Shadow theatre&quot; (写し絵, &quot;Utsushi-e&quot;)
* &quot;Imitation of several people&quot; (八人芸, &quot;Hachinin-gei&quot;)
* &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (怪談, &quot;Kaidan&quot;)
* &quot;Artful Tales&quot; (芸屋噺)

and others.

The main direction was the &quot;kōdan&quot;, the narrative stories. The beginning goes back to the beginning of the Edo period, to the &quot;Taiheiki-yomi&quot; (太平記読), the recitation of the &quot;Taiheiki&quot;. In addition, there were military stories such as the &quot;revenge stories&quot; (仇討物, &quot;Adauchi-mono&quot;), &quot;chivalric stories&quot; (俠客物, &quot;Kyōgaku-mono&quot;), &quot;civic stories&quot; (世話物), etc. When this form of lecture developed, it was called &quot;Kōshaku&quot; (講釈), roughly &quot;Explanatory Lectures&quot;, and was only common in places where the &quot;bushi&quot; (武士), i.e. the Japanese nobility, played a role in which the common people were interested. The lecturers, called &quot;hanashi-ka&quot; (噺家), corresponded to the &quot;rakugo&quot; narrators of the present day.

A well-known lecturer at the end of the Edo period into the Meiji era was San&#x27;yūtei Enchō (三遊亭 圓朝; 1839-1900), who was a master of all variants and laid the foundation for modern performance practice. He published his lectures under the title &quot;Peony Lantern&quot; (牡丹燈籠, &quot;Botan dōrō&quot;) and &quot;Shiobara Tasuke&quot; (塩原多助). The later &quot;Kaidan botan dōrō&quot; (怪談牡丹燈籠) from 1884 was also successful, with Enchō&#x27;s lectures having been taken down in shorthand.

Small theatre spaces typically seating 200 people existed for performances. Most theatres operated on an &quot;Iromonoseki&quot; (色物席) basis, i.e., after a series of younger lecturers, the master performed. Around 1900, 70 such theatres were still active, of which the Suehiro-tei (末廣亭) in Shinjuku district, the Tachibana-tei (立花亭) in Kanda and the Suzumoto-tei (鈴本亭) in Ueno were the best known. They were broadcast on radio from the 1920s onwards, while most &quot;yose&quot; theatres later had to close due to the surge in cinema competition. So the &quot;yose&quot; lives on today on television and radio and in special live broadcasts. Other forms include &quot;Manzai&quot; (漫才) and &quot;Naniwa-bushi&quot; (浪花節).

== &quot;Yosemoji&quot; ==

 are Japanese lettering styles invented for advertising during the Edo period. The name &quot;yosemoji&quot; () literally means &quot;letters for &quot;yose&quot;&quot;. It was used for posters and flyers. Unlike other calligraphic styles, &quot;yosemoji&quot; allows and even encourages multiple brushstrokes in order to fill in the characters as much as possible.

====&quot;Speshnyi&quot;-class (34 units)====
The design &quot;Speshnyi&quot; class proved highly successful with the result that the Russian Navy built 34 over several decades. The first 11 were built over a period of 24 years. The first three were built before 1810, and three more were built towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars. These last three were built of larch and pine, a decision that sacrificed durability for speed and cost of construction. As a result, the Russian Navy sold these three, and some other frigates, to Spain in 1818. The last five of the initial eleven were laid down between 1818 and 1823. The Great Flood of 1824 damaged three, but the Navy salvaged them, and two (&quot;Provoryni&quot; (1820) and &quot;Konstantin&quot; (1824)), fought at the battle of Navarino. By 1831 all of the first 11 had been captured, wrecked, or broken up, with the exception of &quot;Konstantin&quot;. She was hulked in 1837 and finally broken up in 1848. Between 1825 and 1844 the Navy had another 23 built.

<text>Robert Leland Eubanks (born January 8, 1938) is an American disc jockey, television personality and game show host, widely known for hosting the game show &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; on and off since 1966. He also hosted the successful revamp version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; from 1986 to 1989. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his radio DJ work in 2000. It is in front of Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, where he worked during the first years of his broadcasting career. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement Emmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Biography==
Eubanks was born in Flint, Michigan, but was raised primarily in Pasadena, California, where he grew up listening to music, most notably favorites like Frank Sinatra and Doc Watson. His parents, John Otho Leland Eubanks (September 28, 1905 – April 11, 1995) and Gertrude Eubanks (née McClure; 1907–1997), were originally from Missouri. They moved to Flint during the Great Depression, where their only child was born, before moving on to California. The young boy became a child model, doing photo shoots for ads and meeting his idol, Gene Autry, during an ad photo shoot with him.

Eubanks watched popular classic television and quiz game shows. Also growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he was influenced by Cary Grant, Howard Hughes, Buddy Hackett, and Bill Cullen. He attended Pasadena High School, where he graduated in 1955. After graduation from high school, he attended Los Angeles Pierce College (according to his commentary on a Card Sharks episode) and then went on to become one of California&#x27;s most popular disc jockeys. In 1956, Eubanks worked at his first radio station, KACY in Oxnard, California. He joined KRLA in Pasadena in 1960 to do the overnight show. In the spring of 1962, he was promoted to morning drive; a year later, he moved to his long-running 6–9 pm evening slot. During most of the 1960s, he was also a promoter of concerts such as the Beatles&#x27; 1964 and 1965 Hollywood Bowl performances and the Rolling Stones during the first two years of their American tour. While still in Los Angeles, he also promoted such artists as Barry Manilow, The Supremes, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan, Elton John, and Merle Haggard, among others.

Eubanks married Irma Barnard of Ann Arbor, an avid athlete, ranch forewoman and artist, on September 10, 1969. They had three children: Trace, a retired firefighter; Corey, a stuntman; and Theresa. In 1970, the couple purchased a portion of a working cattle ranch, and later expanded it to . The entire family enjoyed roping and riding, with Eubanks participating in rodeos during his spare time. Eubanks is a gold card member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. Barnard handled interior decorating, landscaping, and mounting one to two equestrian shows a year. She died in 2002 after a prolonged illness.

In 2004, Eubanks married Deborah James, a woman 29 years younger. James is a wedding/events coordinator in Ventura, California and has her own company, Bella Vita Events. The couple has a young son, Noah. In October 2010, Eubanks and James put their Westlake Village, California home on the market.

==&quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and country music business==
In 1966, Eubanks received a phone call from Chuck Barris, asking him to host a new game show, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;; the show premiered on ABC later that same year. During its debut, it was an immediate hit, and the show&#x27;s popularity led the network to expand the prime-time lineup, where it had run on the air for five years. Only 28 years old when he started hosting, Eubanks became widely popular for bringing a youthful energy to daytime television, pressing contestants into giving embarrassing and hilarious answers. &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; was also ranked as one of the top three daytime game shows, for five consecutive seasons, between 1968 and 1973, and was ranked in the top three prime-time game shows, also for five seasons, between 1966 and 1971.

While hosting &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, Eubanks was known for using the catchphrase &quot;makin&#x27; whoopee&quot;, in reference to sexual intercourse. It was Eubanks who borrowed the term from the song of the same name, in an attempt to keep parents with young children from having to explain the facts of life because of a television show. While the network was comfortable with the term &quot;making love&quot;, its Standards and Practices Department did not allow the use of the word &quot;panties&quot;.

While not taping, he also pursued a career in the country music business, where he served as manager of such artists as Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell and Marty Robbins. The same year, he also signed Merle Haggard to an exclusive live-performance contract, producing more than 100 dates per year with the performer for almost a decade.

&quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; ended in 1974, after 2195 episodes, making Eubanks one of the most viewed game show hosts to date. He also hosted various editions in syndication (1977–1980, 1985–1988 and 1997–1999). For season two of the show&#x27;s 2009 revival on GSN, Eubanks hosted a celebrity charity episode with Carnie Wilson and her husband Rob Bonfiglio playing against Carnie&#x27;s sister Wendy and her husband Daniel Knutson, and their mother Marilyn Wilson-Rutherford and her current husband Daniel Rutherford. In spring 2010, Eubanks hosted another episode of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, subtitled &quot;Game Show Kings&quot;. It featured Monty Hall and his wife Marilyn Hall, Peter Marshall and his wife Laurie Stewart, and Wink Martindale with his wife Sandy. This made Eubanks the only person to host the same game show in six consecutive decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s).

In 1988, Eubanks left &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; to pursue other interests (though he was still hosting &quot;Card Sharks&quot; on CBS for another seven months) and was replaced by Paul Rodriguez.

In 1996, Eubanks appeared as a substitute host of &quot;Prime Time Country&quot; on The Nashville Network.

==Other game shows==
After &quot;Newlywed Game&quot;, Eubanks hosted a number of other game shows in his career, including &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Dream House&quot;, &quot;The Diamond Head Game&quot;, &quot;Trivia Trap&quot;, and &quot;Powerball: The Game Show&quot;. Eubanks also auditioned to host the CBS daytime version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;; however, Bob Goen was hired instead.

In 1985, Mark Goodson hired Eubanks, a second time (the first being the aforementioned &quot;Trivia Trap&quot;), to host a revamped version of the show &quot;Card Sharks&quot; for CBS. Eubanks hosted &quot;Card Sharks&quot; throughout its CBS run from January 1986 until its demise in March 1989. Prior to hosting &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, he appeared as a special guest on the original NBC version alongside Jim Perry to promote his 1979 game show &quot;All Star Secrets&quot;, which he also produced. 

His final network game show was &quot;Family Secrets&quot;. In recent years, he has hosted or co-hosted all five of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Most Outrageous Game Show Moments&quot; specials. Eubanks was also one of three rotating hosts (along with Chuck Woolery and Jamie Farr) of the &quot;$250,000 Game Show Spectacular&quot; at the Las Vegas Hilton until the show closed in April 2008.

Besides producing Hill-Eubanks&#x27;s &quot;All Star Secrets&quot;, the company also produced &quot;The Guinness Game&quot; in 1979–80, &quot;The Toni Tennille Show&quot; in 1980, Buddy Hackett&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; revival in 1980, and &quot;Infatuation&quot; (which Eubanks also hosted) in 1992. Between 1994 and 1995 Eubanks also traveled to Britain to host a British version of this series, &quot;Infatuation UK&quot;, produced by Thames Television for UK cable network Living TV. Eubanks tried acting, but found he was not good at doing lines; he also learned the game show business was far more lucrative and less confining.

==Radio==
Prior to entering game shows, Eubanks was a popular radio DJ at station KRLA 1110 in Los Angeles as well as a music promoter and manager, between 1960 and 1968. He was responsible for bringing The Beatles to Los Angeles for their first West Coast performances at the famed Hollywood Bowl in 1964 and 1965 (mortgaging his house to do so), with fellow KRLA DJs Dave Hull and Reb Foster joining Eubanks in introducing them. He also operated several Cinnamon Cinder nightclubs. In the early to mid 1960s, the house band at his the Traffic Circle Cinnamon Cinder club was The Vibrants.

He stood in for Casey Kasem twice on radio&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot;: January 9–10, 1982 (that year&#x27;s first regular episode), and April 16–17, 1983.

==Other appearances==
Eubanks hosted the televised 1964 Miss Teen USA pageant, with actor Sebastian Cabot making an appearance as one of the guests.

Eubanks appeared in Michael Moore&#x27;s 1989 documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. The film documented Moore&#x27;s attempts to track General Motors CEO Roger Smith to confront him about the economic devastation resulting from the company&#x27;s closure of eleven manufacturing plants in Flint, Michigan. Eubanks, a native of Flint, was interviewed about his views on the downsizing, and was filmed telling an off-color homophobic, anti-Semitic joke:

According to Moore in the film&#x27;s DVD commentary, Eubanks attempted to denounce the film with the Anti-Defamation League for containing anti-Semitic content, despite the fact that the only anti-semitic content in the film was contributed by Eubanks himself. In a 2010 interview for the Archive of American Television, Eubanks discussed his encounter with Moore and gave an explanation on how the ill-fated joke came about.

In 1992, Eubanks appeared on the TV sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; in the episode &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; hosting the game show &quot;Double Trouble&quot;. That same year, he also made a cameo in the movie &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; hosting the game show &quot;Ding-Dang-Dong&quot;, where he mentioned that the show&#x27;s contestants stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, and also gave the phone number for reservations (which allowed Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, to check in).

He has also hosted the Tournament of Roses Parade on Los Angeles television channel KTLA since 1976 and with Stephanie Edwards from 1978 to 2005. In 2006, Eubanks continued to host with Edwards&#x27;s replacement, KTLA Morning Show anchor Michaela Pereira. Edwards returned to her co-hosting position alongside Eubanks in 2009. In September 2015, Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards announced on the KTLA Morning News that the 2016 parade will be their last. In 2017, they were replaced by Leeza Gibbons and Mark Steines.

Eubanks appeared as himself on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; in the episode &quot;The Honeymoon&#x27;s Over&quot;, which aired May 1999. He guest-starred on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in the January 2000 episode &quot;Eric&#x27;s Stash&quot;.

He also hosted for some years the Miss California USA Pageant and Mrs. International Pageant, sister pageant to the Miss International (United States) Pageant, between 2000 and 2003.

On July 6, 2007, Eubanks sat in as a celebrity &quot;Mob Member&quot; on the NBC game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;. A year after that, he appeared as a &quot;GSN Live&quot; guest on April 4, 2008, and returned on May 18, 2010. His most recent television appearance (not counting his annual KTLA Rose Parade appearances) was on &quot;The Amazing Race 17&quot; season finale, which aired December 12, 2010. In 2011, Eubanks hosted a special version of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, live at Champion&#x27;s Week for the &quot;NASCAR&quot; &quot;Sprint Cup Series&quot;.

His autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s in the Book, Bob&quot; (), was published in 2004.

Eubanks briefly appears in the music video for The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot;

In 2013, Eubanks toured with &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Game Shows: Live on Stage&quot;.

In 2015, he appeared as a host of a couples game on &quot;Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars&quot; on We TV.

On April 21, 2023, it was announced that Eubanks would be featured in an upcoming four-episode documentary by ABC News titled &quot;The Game Show Show&quot;, covering the history of game shows in America over the last eight decades. The four-part documentary premiered on May 10, 2023.

<text>The Manzanares () is a river in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, which flows from the Sierra de Guadarrama, passes through Madrid, and eventually empties into the Jarama river, which in turn is a right-bank tributary to the Tagus.

In its urban section, the Manzanares River was modified to create a section of water several meters deep, in some parts navigable by canoes. This project of channeling and damming has been partially reversed in a re-naturalization project.

== Hydronym ==
The name of Manzanares was in use already in the 16th century, although up until the 17th century alternative names such as Guadarrama, Henarejos, and Jarama were used. It was widely popularised by the height of the 18th century. The origin of the name for the river and the village of the same name through which it flows (founded not earlier than the 13th century) is moot.

==Course==
=== Sources ===

The Manzanares has its sources in the southern slope of the , a branch of the Sierra de Guadarrama (the main eastern section of the Sistema Central), in the municipality of Manzanares el Real, in the Madrid region.

It is formally called Manzanares after the confluence of the Arroyo de la Condesa and the Arroyo de Valdemartín.

The Arroyo de la Condesa is in turn born in the , a traditionally resilient snowdrift, and its watershed comprises the slopes in between La Maliciosa (2,227 m), the Alto de las Guarramillas—aka the Bola del Mundo (2,258 m)—and the (2,282 m).

The Arroyo de Valdemartín&#x27;s watershed spans from the Alto de Valdemartín to the Cabeza de Hierro Menor (2,373 m).

=== Upper course ===

The upper river basin is protected as the &quot;Parque Regional de la Cuenca Alta del Manzanares&quot;, a nature reserve which is recognised as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO.

The Manzanares flows in a south-eastern direction from its sources and passes through the medieval town of Manzanares el Real where it is dammed to form the Santillana reservoir, one of the most important water supplies for the capital.

The river then takes a southern direction and enters the Monte de El Pardo, an ecologically valuable area on the edge of Madrid.

=== Urban course ===

The river was canalised where it passes through the built-up areas of the city. In the 21st century the river was restored to provide biodiversity and facilities for Madrid residents.

The Manzanares skims past the westernmost part of the city and further downstream serves as a dividing line between the old centre of the city and the Carabanchel and Usera neighbourhoods to the southwest. It is along this stretch that it passes next to Atlético Madrid&#x27;s former football ground, the Vicente Calderón. The river leaves the city at its southernmost tip.

=== Lower course ===

It makes a strong eastern turn which takes it past the village of Perales del Río. It empties into the Jarama within the municipal limits of Rivas Vaciamadrid.

==Historical importance==

The river Manzanares, although small and relatively unimportant geographically, has had a great historical importance due to its close relation to the city of Madrid, which was founded by the Moors as a citadel overlooking the river in the ninth century.

The river is also featured in many paintings of the late 18th to early 19th-century painter Francisco de Goya, which show traditionally dressed &quot;Madrileños&quot; in activities like dancing or having picnics next to the river.

The Manzanares was also an important defence line for the Republican forces during the Siege of Madrid in the Spanish Civil War, and many bunkers can still be seen near the village of Perales del Río. The Bridge of the French was of crucial importance because of its strategic location. There, nationalist forces were repeatedly repelled and denied access to Madrid’s city centre.

<text>Kurgan () is the largest city and the administrative center of Kurgan Oblast in the south of the Urals Federal District of Russia. Population: .

Until 1782, Kurgan bore the name &quot;Tsaryovo Gorodishche&quot;.

==History==
An urban settlement was established here between 1659 and 1662 as Tsaryovo Gorodishche (, meaning &quot;Imperial Citadel&quot;) by Timofey Nevezhin, a farmer from Tyumen. In the ensuing years it was developed as a fortress town. It served as a frontier post and its fortified position enabled it to defend other Russian settlements from nomad attacks. Nevertheless, it was itself not always able to withstand such attacks, and was sometimes plundered and burnt down.

The city was granted city privileges by the Empress Catherine the Great in 1782, which is when it acquired its present name and became the seat of an uyezd. The present name is taken from a large kurgan (burial mound) close to the original settlement.

Its coat of arms was granted on 17 March 1785, and it became the administrative center of Kurgan Oblast in 1943. Kurgan was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1982.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Kurgan is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Kurgan City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Kurgan City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Kurgan Urban Okrug.

==Economy and military==
Kurgan stands on the Trans-Siberian Railway line, between Yekaterinburg and Omsk. It is served by two railway stations and the Kurgan Airport, and it was home to the Kurgan West air base during the Cold War. It is also home to Russian Ilizarov Scientific Center for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics, KAvZ autobus plant, and the machine building company Kurganmashzavod which produces the widely known BMP-1, BMP-2 and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles.

==Climate==
Kurgan has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). Influenced by the Siberian High, it is a relatively dry climate. Winters are cold, although not severe by Siberian standards. Summers are variable but relatively moderate, even though heat waves can bring temperatures well above the average July highs.

<text>The Sculptor Galaxy (also known as the Silver Coin Galaxy, Silver Dollar Galaxy, NGC 253, or Caldwell 65) is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor. The Sculptor Galaxy is a starburst galaxy, which means that it is currently undergoing a period of intense star formation.

==Observation==

===Observational history===
The galaxy was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783 during one of her systematic comet searches. About half a century later, John Herschel observed it using his 18-inch metallic mirror reflector at the Cape of Good Hope. He wrote: &quot;very bright and large (24′ in length); a superb object... Its light is somewhat streaky, but I see no stars in it except 4 large and one very small one, and these seem not to belong to it, there being many near...&quot;

In 1961, Allan Sandage wrote in the &quot;Hubble Atlas of Galaxies&quot; that the Sculptor Galaxy is &quot;the prototype example of a special subgroup of Sc systems...photographic images of galaxies of the group are dominated by the dust pattern. Dust lanes and patches of great complexity are scattered throughout the surface. Spiral arms are often difficult to trace... The arms are defined as much by the dust as by the spiral pattern.&quot; Bernard Y. Mills, working out of Sydney, discovered that the Sculptor Galaxy is also a fairly strong radio source.

In 1998, the Hubble Space Telescope took a detailed image of NGC 253.

===Amateur===
As one of the brightest galaxies in the sky, the Sculptor Galaxy can be seen through binoculars and is near the star Beta Ceti. It is considered one of the most easily viewed galaxies in the sky after the Andromeda Galaxy.

The Sculptor Galaxy is a good target for observation with a telescope with a 300 mm diameter or larger. In such telescopes, it appears as a galaxy with a long, oval bulge and a mottled galactic disc. Although the bulge appears only slightly brighter than the rest of the galaxy, it is fairly extended compared to the disk. In 400 mm scopes and larger, a dark dust lane northwest of the nucleus is visible, and over a dozen faint stars can be seen superimposed on the bulge. Some people claim to have observed the galaxy with the unaided eye under exceptional viewing conditions.

==Features==
The Sculptor Galaxy is located at the center of the Sculptor Group, one of the nearest groups of galaxies to the Milky Way. The Sculptor Galaxy (the brightest galaxy in the group and one of the intrinsically brightest galaxies in the vicinity of ours, only surpassed by the Andromeda Galaxy and the Sombrero Galaxy) and the companion galaxies NGC 247, PGC 2881, PGC 2933, Sculptor-dE1, and UGCA 15 form a gravitationally-bound core near the center of the group. Most other galaxies associated with the Sculptor Group are only weakly gravitationally bound to this core.

===Starburst===
NGC 253&#x27;s starburst has created several super star clusters on NGC 253&#x27;s center (discovered with the aid of the Hubble Space Telescope): one with a mass of solar masses, and absolute magnitude of at least −15, and two others with solar masses and absolute magnitudes around −11; later studies have discovered an even more massive cluster heavily obscured by NGC 253&#x27;s interstellar dust with a mass of solar masses, an age of around years, and rich in Wolf-Rayet stars. The super star clusters are arranged in an ellipse around the center of NGC 253, which from the Earth&#x27;s perspective appears as a flat line.

Star formation is also high in the northeast of NGC 253&#x27;s disk, where a number of red supergiant stars can be found, and in its halo there are young stars as well as some amounts of neutral hydrogen. This, along with other peculiarities found in NGC 253, suggest that a gas-rich dwarf galaxy collided with it 200 million years ago, disturbing its disk and starting the present starburst.

As happens in other galaxies suffering strong star formation such as Messier 82, NGC 4631, or NGC 4666, the stellar winds of the massive stars produced in the starburst as well as their deaths as supernovae have blown out material to NGC 253&#x27;s halo in the form of a superwind that seems to be inhibiting star formation in the galaxy.

===Novae and Supernovae===
Although supernovae are generally associated with starburst galaxies, only one has been detected within the Sculptor Galaxy. SN 1940E (type unknown, mag. 14) was discovered by Fritz Zwicky on 22 November 1940, located approximately 54″ southwest of the galaxy&#x27;s nucleus.

NGC 253 is close enough that classical novae can also be detected. The first confirmed nova in this galaxy was discovered by BlackGEM at magnitude 19.6 on 12 July 2024, and designated AT 2024pid.

===Central black hole===
Research suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole in the center of this galaxy with a mass estimated to be 5 million times that of the Sun, which is slightly heavier than Sagittarius A*.

===Distance estimates===
At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to Sculptor in the past ten years.

Using the planetary nebula luminosity function method, an estimate of 10.89 million light years (or Mly; 3.34 Megaparsecs, or Mpc) was achieved in 2005.

The Sculptor Galaxy is close enough that the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) method may also be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to Sculptor using this technique in 2004 yielded ().

A weighted average of the most reliable distance estimates gives a distance of ().

==Satellite==
An international team of researchers has used the Subaru Telescope to identify a faint dwarf galaxy disrupted by NGC 253. The satellite galaxy is called NGC 253-dw2 and may not survive its next passage by its much larger host. The host galaxy may suffer some damage too if the dwarf is massive enough. The interplay between the two galaxies is responsible for the disturbance in NGC 253&#x27;s structure.

<text>Briceni () is a city in northern Moldova. It is the seat of Briceni District.

==Demographics==
At the 2004 census, the city had a population of 8,765. At the 1930 census, there were two localities: &quot;Briceni Târg&quot; (literally &quot;Briceni Fair&quot;), and &quot;Briceni Sat&quot; (literally &quot;Briceni village&quot;), and at the time they were part of &quot;Plasa Briceni&quot; of Hotin County.

==Etymology==
The town has been also called: Berchan, Bricheni, Bricheni Târg, Bricheni Sat, Britchan, Britchani, Britsiteni.

A village, approximately to the east to the city, is also known as Briceni. It is at 48° 22´ north latitude and 27° 42´ east longitude, which puts that town north northwest of Chişinău.

==Climate==
==Jewish community==

The Jewish cemetery of Briceni contains some 3,250 remaining tombstones though it is heavily overgrown and many are illegible. It is located in the eastern vicinities of the town, left of the road R11 leading to Ocnița.

==History==
On 5 December 2022, during a Russian bombing campaign against Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a missile fell within the borders of Moldova into an orchard near Briceni. On 16 February 2023, another missile fell into the village of Larga. As a result of this incident, residents of Briceni expressed fear.

<doc id="979488" wikidata="Q1282870" url="?curid=979488" title="Ice rink">
<text>An ice rink (or ice skating rink) is a frozen body of water or an artificial sheet of ice where people can ice skate or play winter sports. Ice rinks are also used for exhibitions, contests and ice shows. The growth and increasing popularity of ice skating during the 1800s marked a rise in the deliberate construction of ice rinks in numerous areas of the world.

The word &quot;rink&quot; is a word of Scottish origin meaning &quot;course&quot;, used to describe the ice surface used in the sport of curling, but was kept in use once the winter team sport of ice hockey became established.

There are two types of ice rinks in prevalent use today: natural ice rinks, where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial ice rinks (or mechanically frozen), where a coolant produces cold temperatures underneath the water body (on which the game is played), causing the water body to freeze and then stay frozen. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics.

Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include: ice hockey, sledge hockey ( &quot;Para ice hockey&quot;, or &quot;sled hockey&quot;), spongee ( sponge hockey), bandy, rink bandy, rinkball, ringette, broomball (both indoor and outdoor versions), Moscow broomball, speed skating, figure skating, ice stock sport, curling, and crokicurl. However, Moscow broomball is typically played on a tarmac tennis court that has been flooded with water and allowed to freeze. The sports of broomball, curling, ice stock sport, spongee, Moscow broomball, and the game of crokicurl, do not use ice skates of any kind.

While technically not an ice rink, ice tracks and trails, such as those used in the sport of speed skating and recreational or pleasure skating are sometimes referred to as &quot;ice rinks&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Rink&quot;, a Scottish word meaning &#x27;course&#x27;, was used as the name of a place where curling was played. As curling is played on ice, the name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for other sports and uses.

==History==
===Great Britain===
====London, England====

Early attempts in the construction of artificial ice rinks were first made in the &#x27;rink mania&#x27; of 1841–44. The technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, therefore these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog&#x27;s lard and various salts. An item in the May 8, 1844 issue of Eliakim Littell&#x27;s &quot;Living Age&quot; headed &quot;The Glaciarium&quot; reported that &quot;This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East&#x27; Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating&quot;.
By 1844, these venues fell out of fashion as customers grew tired of the &#x27;smelly&#x27; ice substitute. It wasn&#x27;t until thirty years later that refrigeration technology developed to the point where natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world&#x27;s first mechanically frozen ice rink was the &quot;Glaciarium&quot;, opened by John Gamgee, a British veterinarian and inventor, in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876. Gamgee had become fascinated by the refrigeration technology he encountered during a study trip to America to look at Texas fever in cattle. In March of that same year it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring was established.

The rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks. Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether, nitrogen peroxide and water. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into ice. Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand, and patented it as early as 1870.
Gamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air ice skating during winters in the Alps. He installed an orchestra gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the Swiss Alps.

The rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at Rusholme in Manchester and the &quot;Floating Glaciarium&quot; at Charing Cross in London, this last significantly larger at . The Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879, using Gamgee&#x27;s method.

====The Fens, England====
In the marshlands of The Fens, skating was developed early as a pastime during winter where there were plenty of natural ice surfaces. This is the origin of the Fen skating and is said to be the birthplace of bandy. The Great Britain Bandy Association has its home in the area.

===Hungary===
In Austria-Hungary, the first artificial ice skating rink opened in 1870 in The City Park of Budapest, which is still in operation to this day and is considered one of the largest in Europe.

===Germany===

In Germany, the first ice skating rink opened in 1882 in Frankfurt during a patent exhibition. It covered and operated for two months; the refrigeration system was designed by Jahre Linde, and was probably the first skating rink where ammonia was used as a refrigerant. Ten years later, a larger rink was permanently installed on the same site.

===United States===
===Early indoor ice rinks===

Ice skating quickly became a favorite pastime and craze in several American cities around the mid 1800s spawning a construction period of several ice rinks.

Two early indoor ice rinks made of mechanically frozen ice in the United States opened in 1894, the North Avenue Ice Palace in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Ice Palace in New York City.

The St. Nicholas Rink, ( &quot;St. Nicholas Arena&quot;), was an indoor ice rink in New York City which existed from 1896 until its demolition in the 1980s. It was one of the earliest American indoor ice rinks made of mechanically frozen ice in North America and gave ice skaters the opportunity to enjoy an extended skating season. The rink was used for pleasure skating, ice hockey, and ice skating, and was an important rink involved in the development of the sports of ice hockey and boxing in the United States.

====Oldest indoor artificial ice rink in use====

The oldest indoor artificial ice rink still in use in the United States is Boston, Massachusetts&#x27;s, Matthews Arena (formerly Boston Arena) which was built between 1909 and 1910. The rink is located on the campus of Northeastern University.

This American rink is the original home of the National Hockey League (NHL) Boston Bruins. The Bruins are the only remaining NHL team who are members of the NHL&#x27;s Original Six with their original home arena still in existence.

====Contemporary====
The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval is an outdoor ice rink in Roseville, Minnesota, that is large enough to allow ice skaters to play the sport of bandy. Its perimeter is used as an oval speed skating track. The facility was constructed between June and December 1993. It is the only regulation-sized bandy field in North America and serves as the home of USA Bandy and its national bandy teams. The $3.9 million renovation project planned for the Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval was set to be completed before the opening of the rink&#x27;s 29th season on November 18, 2022.

The oval measures at 400 meters long and 200 meters wide, which makes it the largest artificial outdoor refrigerated sheet of ice in North America. It is a world-class facility that is primarily used for ice sports such as ice skating, ice hockey, speed skating, and bandy. The oval hosts several national and international competitions throughout the year, including the USA Cup in bandy.

===Canada===

The first building in Canada to be electrified was the Victoria Skating Rink which opened in 1862 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The rink was created using natural ice. At the start of the twentieth century it had been described as &quot;one of the finest covered rinks in the world&quot; and was used during winter for pleasure skating, ice hockey, and skating sports. In summer months, the building was used for various other events.

==Types==

===Natural ice===

Many ice rinks consist of, or are found on, open bodies of water such as lakes, ponds, canals, and sometimes rivers; these can be used only in the winter in climates where the surface freezes thickly enough to support human weight. Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground, filling it with water, and letting it freeze. Snow may be packed to use as a containment material.

An example of this type of &quot;rink&quot;, which is a body of water converted into a skating trail during winter, is the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario.

===Artificial ice===

In any climate, an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space. This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of concrete, through (or on top of) which pipes run. The pipes carry a chilled fluid (usually either a salt brine or water with antifreeze, or in the case of smaller rinks, refrigerant) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze. This method is known as &#x27;artificial ice&#x27; to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate, indoors or outdoors, although both types are of frozen water. A more proper technical term is &#x27;mechanically frozen&#x27; ice.

An example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at Rockefeller Center in New York.

====Construction====
Modern rinks have a specific procedure for preparing the surface. With the pipes cold, a thin layer of water is sprayed on the sand or concrete to seal and level it (or in the case of concrete, to keep it from being marked). This thin layer is painted white or pale blue for better contrast; markings necessary for hockey or curling are also placed, along with logos or other decorations. Another thin layer of water is sprayed on top of this. The ice is built up to a thickness of .

===Synthetic===

Synthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal-bladed ice skates. High density polyethelene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics, with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice-like skating but also being the most expensive. A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy, level and smooth sub-floor (anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass) to create a large skating area.

==Operation==

Periodically after the ice has been used, it is resurfaced using a machine called an ice resurfacer (sometimes colloquially referred to as a Zamboni – referring to a major manufacturer of such machinery). For curling, the surface is &#x27;pebbled&#x27; by allowing loose drops of cold water to fall onto the ice and freeze into rounded peaks.

Between events, especially if the arena is being used without need for the ice surface, it is either covered with a heavily insulated floor or melted by allowing the fluid in the pipes below the ice to warm.

A highly specialized form of rink is used for speed skating; this is a large oval (or &quot;ring&quot;) much like an athletic track. Because of their limited use, speed skating ovals are far less common than hockey or curling rinks.

Those skilled at preparing arena ice are often in demand for major events where ice quality is critical. The popularity of the sport of hockey in Canada has led its icemakers to be particularly sought after. One such team of professionals was responsible for placing a loonie coin under center ice at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah; as both Canadian teams (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) won their respective hockey gold medals, the coin was christened &quot;lucky&quot; and is now in the possession of the Hockey Hall of Fame after having been retrieved from beneath the ice.

==Standard rink sizes==

===Bandy===

In bandy, the size of the playing field is x . For internationals, the size must not be smaller than . The variety rink bandy is played on ice hockey rinks.
===Figure skating===
The size of figure skating rinks can be quite variable, but the International Skating Union prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. These are . The ISU specifies that competition rinks must not be larger than this and not smaller than .

===Ice hockey===

Although there is a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual ice rinks, there are basically two rink sizes in use at the highest levels of ice hockey. Historically, earlier ice rinks were smaller than today.

Official National Hockey League rinks are . The dimensions originate from the size of the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Official Olympic and International ice hockey rinks have dimensions of .

===Para ice hockey===
Sledge hockey ( &quot;Para ice hockey&quot;, or &quot;sled hockey&quot;), uses the same rink dimensions used by ice hockey rinks.

===Ringette===
Ringette utilizes most of the standard ice hockey markings used by Hockey Canada, but the ringette rink uses additional free-pass dots in each of the attacking zones and centre zone areas as well as a larger goal crease area. Two additional free-play lines (one in each attacking zone) are also required.

A ringette rink is an ice rink designed for ice hockey which has been modified to enable ringette to be played. Though some ice surfaces are designed strictly for ringette, these ice rinks with exclusive lines and markings for ringette are usually created only at venues hosting major ringette competitions and events. Most ringette rinks are found in Canada and Finland.

Playing area, size, lines and markings for the standard Canadian ringette rink are similar to the average ice hockey rink in Canada with certain modifications.

Early in its history, ringette was played mostly on rinks constructed for ice hockey, broomball, figure skating, and recreational skating, and was mostly played on outdoor rinks since few indoor ice rinks were available at the time.

===Broomball===
The organized format of broomball uses the rink dimensions defined by a standard Canadian ice hockey rink.

===Spongee===

The sport of spongee, &quot;sponge hockey&quot;, does not use ice skates. A skateless outdoor winter variant of ice hockey, spongee has its own rules codes and is played strictly within the Canadian city of Winnipeg as a cult sport. The sport generally uses the rink dimensions defined by a standard Canadian ice hockey rink.

===Rinkball===

Rinkball rinks today typically use the measurements of an ice hockey rink, though may be slightly larger due to the sport having originated in Europe where the bandy field influenced the size and development of smaller ice rinks.

==Tracks and trails==

Tracks and trails are occasionally referred to as ice rinks in spite of their differences.

Ice skating tracks and ice skating trails are used for recreational exercise and sporting activities during the winter season including distance ice skating. Ice trails are created by natural bodies of water such as rivers, which freeze during winter, though some trails are created by removing snow to create skating lanes on large frozen lakes for ice skaters.

Ice trails are usually used for pleasure skating, though the sport and recreational activity of Tour skating can involve ice skaters passing over ice trails and open areas created by frozen lakes.

To date, speed skating and ice cross downhill are the only winter activities or sports whereby ice skaters use tracks and lanes designed to include bends rather than using a simple straightway. Some ice rinks are constructed in a manner allowing for a speed skating rink to be created around its outside perimeter.

===Tracks===
====Speed skating track====
Speed skating tracks or &quot;rinks&quot; can either be created naturally or artificially and are made either outdoors or inside indoor facilities. Tracks may be created by having the lanes surround the exterior of an ice rink.

The sport requires the use of a special type of racing skate, the speed skating ice skate.
In speed skating, for short track, the official Olympic rink size is , with an oval ice track of in circumference.

In long track speed skating the oval ice track is usually in circumference.

====Ice skating marathon tracks====

An ice skating marathon is a long distance speed skating race which may be held on natural ice on canals and bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Marathon is a discipline of speed skating, which is founded in the Netherlands.
The races concern speed skating by at least five skaters who start all together on an ice rink with a minimum length of 333.33 meters or on a track:
* Minimum distance longer than 6.4 kilometers and up to 200 kilometers for skaters who have reached the age of 17 prior to the skating season on July 1.
* Minimum distance longer than 4 kilometers and up to 20 kilometers for skaters who have reached the age of or the age of 13, but have not yet reached the age of 17 before July 1 preceding the skating season.
* Minimum distance of 2 kilometers and up to 10 kilometers for skaters who have not yet reached the age of 13 before July 1 preceding the skating season.

====Dutch skating tracks====
The Netherlands is home of Elfstedentocht, a 200 km distance skating race of which the tracks leads through the 11 different cities in Friesland which is a northern province of the Netherlands.

Skate tracks on natural ice are maintained by the towns and communities, who take care of the safety of the tracks.

====Ice cross downhill tracks====
Ice cross downhill, (formerly known as &quot;Red Bull Crashed Ice&quot; or &quot;Crashed Ice&quot;), is a winter extreme sporting event involving direct competitive downhill skating. Skaters race down a walled track which features sharp turns and high vertical drops.

===Trails===
====Rideau Canal Skateway====
An example of an ice skating trail, or &quot;rink&quot;, is the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, estimated at and long, which is equivalent to 90 Olympic-size skating rinks.

The rink is prepared by lowering the canal&#x27;s water level and letting the canal water freeze. The rink is then resurfaced nightly by cleaning the ice of snow and flooding it with water from below the ice. The rink is recognized as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest naturally frozen ice rink&quot; by the Guinness Book of World Records because &quot;its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length&quot;.

====Longest trail====
The longest ice skating trail is in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, on Lake Windermere Whiteway. The naturally frozen trail measures .

===Combined===
Outdoor ice skating activities and competitions involving a goal of distance travel for recreation, exercise, competition and adventure, can involve frozen lakes, rivers, and canals.

====Tour skating====
The sport and recreational activity, Tour skating ( &quot;Nordic skating&quot; in North America), is strictly an outdoor activity for ice skaters. Nordic skating originated during the 1900s in Sweden.

Ice skaters traverse naturally frozen bodies of water, which sometimes, but not always, includes interconnected ice trails as well as frozen ponds, lakes, and even marsh areas. Tour skaters use a special ice skate with long blades.

====Elfstedentocht (Eleven cities tour)====
The Elfstedentocht (Eleven Cities Tour) is a long-distance tour skating event on natural ice, almost long, which is held both as a speed skating competition (with 300 contestants) and a leisure tour (with 16,000 skaters). It is the biggest ice-skating tour in the world and held in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands.

The event leads past all eleven historical cities of the province and is held at most once a year, only when the natural ice along the entire course is at least thick. It is sometimes held on consecutive years, while at other times, gaps between the touring years have exceeded 20 years. When the ice is suitable, the tour is announced and starts within 48 hours. The last Elfstedentocht was held in 1997.

==Laneways==

The sports of curling and Ice stock sport are played on either ice rinks or simple ice surfaces with lanes marked out for play.

===Curling===


The sport of curling uses an ice rink known as a &quot;curling rink&quot; or curling sheet. Curling does not involve ice skating. Curling uses lanes.

The curling sheet is a carefully prepared rectangular area of ice created to be as flat and level as possible. The ice surface dimensions are in length by in width. A curling sheet includes areas marked off in a manner specific to the sport, including the &quot;house&quot;, the &quot;button&quot;, &quot;hog lines&quot;, &quot;hacks&quot;, and shorter borders along the ends of the sheet called the backboards.

The dimensions of an official curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling. At major events, ice preparation and maintenance is extremely important. Curling clubs usually have an ice maker whose main job is to care for the ice.

===Ice stock sport===

Ice stock sport (sometimes spelt &quot;Icestocksport&quot; or &quot;Bavarian curling&quot;) is a winter sport comparable to curling. It&#x27;s called Eisstockschießen in German. Although the sport is typically played on ice, summer competitions are performed on asphalt.

==Other==
===Crokicurl===

Crokicurl is a Canadian winter sport and is a large scale hybrid of curling and the board game Crokinole. It is played outdoors by teams consisting of two players who take turns trying to score points on a quadrant shaped area with the playing area marked off on a sheet of ice. The quadrant includes posts, starting line, wooden edge side-rail, and a 20-point &quot;button&quot;. Depending on the area involved, players can score 5, 10, or 15 points.

==Outdoor ice==

Outdoor ice rinks and frozen ponds, rivers, and canals, serve several purposes, allowing for physical activities during the winter season such as recreational ice skating and figure skating, and also function as an affordable place for players to engage in team winter sports such as ice hockey, bandy, rinkball, ringette, broomball, and spongee, as a pastime.

These areas and facilities also help individuals, youth sporting organizations, and families, offset the expensive cost of indoor ice-time. They are also used as a part of outdoor winter festivals and to host pond hockey tournaments and the like.

===Decline===
====Rinks====
The length of outdoor ice skating season began to experience a noticeable decline in North America in the early part of the 21st century.

One of the correlated factors involved has been attributed to climate change. One of the consequences involved includes reducing access to outdoor facilities needed by youth who require opportunities to participate in ice-based sports at length and with low-cost, a problematic development considering winter sports become increasingly expensive over time resulting in economic exclusion.

RinkWatch

RinkWatch is a citizen science program in Canada run by researchers at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. Beginning in 2013 the program started collecting data on outdoor rinks and frozen ponds across North America. The objective is to better understand how climate change may be impacting the outdoor skating season.

====Tracks and trails====
Elfstedentocht, the world&#x27;s biggest ice-skating tour involving tour skating and speed skating, has been declared to be in danger of &quot;extinction&quot; due to climate change. The last Elfstedentocht was held in 1997.

<doc id="979500" wikidata="Q5598080" url="?curid=979500" title="Gravity loss">
<text>In astrodynamics and rocketry, gravity loss is a measure of the loss in the net performance of a rocket while it is thrusting in a gravitational field. In other words, it is the cost of having to hold the rocket up in a gravity field.

Gravity losses depend on the time over which thrust is applied as well the direction the thrust is applied in. Gravity losses as a proportion of delta-v are minimised if maximum thrust is applied for a short time, and by avoiding thrusting directly away from the local gravitational field. During the launch and ascent phase, however, thrust must be applied over a long period with a major component of thrust in the opposite direction to gravity, so gravity losses become significant. For example, to reach a speed of 7.8 km/s in low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of between 9 and 10 km/s. The additional 1.5 to 2 km/s delta-v is due to gravity losses, steering losses and atmospheric drag.

==Example==

Consider the simplified case of a vehicle with constant mass accelerating vertically with a constant thrust per unit mass &quot;a&quot; in a gravitational field of strength &quot;g&quot;. The actual acceleration of the craft is &quot;a&quot;-&quot;g&quot; and it is using delta-v at a rate of &quot;a&quot; per unit time.

Over a time &quot;t&quot; the change in speed of the spacecraft is (&quot;a&quot;-&quot;g&quot;)&quot;t&quot;, whereas the delta-v expended is &quot;at&quot;. The gravity loss is the difference between these figures, which is &quot;gt&quot;. As a proportion of delta-v, the gravity loss is &quot;g&quot;/&quot;a&quot;.

A very large thrust over a very short time will achieve a desired speed increase with little gravity loss. On the other hand, if &quot;a&quot; is only slightly greater than &quot;g&quot;, the gravity loss is a large proportion of delta-v. Gravity loss can be described as the extra delta-v needed because of not being able to spend all the needed delta-v instantaneously.

This effect can be explained in two equivalent ways:
*The specific energy gained per unit delta-v is equal to the speed, so efficiency is maximized when the delta-v is spent when the craft already has a high speed, due to the Oberth effect.
*Efficiency drops drastically with increasing time spent thrusting against gravity. Therefore, it is advisable to minimize the burn time.

These effects apply whenever climbing to an orbit with higher specific orbital energy, such as during launch to low Earth orbit (LEO) or from LEO to an escape orbit. This is a worst case calculation - in practice, gravity loss during launch and ascent is less than the maximum value of &quot;gt&quot; because the launch trajectory does not remain vertical and the vehicle&#x27;s mass is not constant, due to consumption of propellant and staging.

== Vector considerations ==

Thrust is a vector quantity, and the direction of the thrust has a large impact on the size of gravity losses. For instance, gravity loss on a rocket of mass &quot;m&quot; would reduce a 3&quot;m&quot;&quot;g&quot; thrust directed upward to an acceleration of 2&quot;g&quot;. However, the same 3&quot;mg&quot; thrust could be directed at such an angle that it had a 1&quot;mg&quot; upward component, completely canceled by gravity, and a horizontal component of mg×formula_1 = 2.8&quot;mg&quot; (by Pythagoras&#x27; theorem), achieving a 2.8&quot;g&quot; horizontal acceleration.

As orbital speeds are approached, vertical thrust can be reduced as centrifugal force (in the rotating frame of reference around the center of the Earth) counteracts a large proportion of the gravitation force on the rocket, and more of the thrust can be used to accelerate. Gravity losses can therefore also be described as the integral of gravity (irrespective of the vector of the rocket) minus the centrifugal force. Using this perspective, when a spacecraft reaches orbit, the gravity losses continue but are counteracted perfectly by the centrifugal force. Since a rocket has very little centrifugal force at launch, the net gravity losses per unit time are large at liftoff.

It is important to note that minimising gravity losses is not the only objective of a launching spacecraft. Rather, the objective is to achieve the position/velocity combination for the desired orbit. For instance, the way to maximize acceleration is to thrust straight downward; however, thrusting downward is clearly not a viable course of action for a rocket intending to reach orbit.

<text>The Graham number or Benjamin Graham number is a figure used in securities investing that measures a stock&#x27;s so-called fair value. Named after Benjamin Graham, the founder of value investing, the Graham number can be calculated as follows:

formula_1

The final number is, theoretically, the maximum price that a defensive investor should pay for the given stock. Put another way, a stock priced below the Graham Number would be considered a good value, if it also meets a number of other criteria. 

The Number represents the geometric mean of the maximum that one would pay based on earnings and based on book value. Graham writes:

==Alternative calculation==
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing &quot;net income&quot; by &quot;shares outstanding&quot;. Book value is another way of saying &quot;shareholders&#x27; equity&quot;. Therefore, book value per share is calculated by dividing &quot;equity&quot; by &quot;shares outstanding&quot;. Consequently, the formula for the Graham number can also be written as follows:

A similar impressive feat was achieved by Olympiacos CFP in another team sport in 2018: after the 2017–18 CEV Women&#x27;s Challenge Cup win of Olympiacos women&#x27;s volleyball department, Olympiacos CFP became the only multi-sport club in Greece and one of the very few in European volleyball history to have won European titles with its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams.

Olympiacos men&#x27;s basketball team holds several distinctions. Winning their third Euroleague title in 2013, they are the inaugural and only Greek club (only the third club in European basketball history) to be consecutive title defenders in the modern Final Four era of the EuroLeague. They beat Real Madrid in the final of the 2012–13 EuroLeague Final Four in London, 100–88.

Olympiacos CFP has nurtured some of the greatest Greek athletes. Olympiacos&#x27; athletes have become Olympic medal winners, as well as World and European champions, while they are integral part of the Greek national teams. The club maintains Academies with state of the art training facilities, where thousands of children have the opportunity to learn about sports and practice. Olympiacos CFP have granted Greek sports and the club itself numerous Olympic, Worldwide and European honours. Olympiacos had 30 of its athletes and coaches from nine of its sports departments participating in the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Olympiacos is the most popular Greek club with around four million fans inside Greece and millions of others in the Greek communities all over the world. As of April 2006, Olympiacos has 83,000 registered members and is placed in the top ten of the clubs with the most paying members in the world, holding the ninth place just ahead of Real Madrid. In 2014, that figure increased and the team boasts 98,000 registered members. Olympiacos CFP was the first Greek club that made it possible for its fans to become members, and granted them the right of voting for the board of directors.

== History ==
Olympiacos CFP was founded on March 10, 1925 in Piraeus, as a football club initially, and the club&#x27;s aim, as stated in the statutes, is the systematic cultivation and development of its athletes’ possibilities for participation in athletic competitions, the spreading of the Olympic athletic ideal and the promotion of sportsmanship and fanship among the youth according to egalitarian principles, by stressing a healthy, ethical and social basis as its foundation. Members of &quot;Piraikos Podosfairikos Omilos FC&quot; (Sport and Football Club of Piraeus) and &quot;Piraeus Fans Club FC&quot; decided, during a historical assembly, to dissolve the two clubs in order to establish a new unified one, which would bring this new vision and dynamic to the community. Notis Kamperos, a senior officer of the Hellenic Air Force, proposed the name &quot;Olympiacos&quot; and the profile of a laurel-crowned Olympic winner as the emblem of the new club. Michalis Manouskos, a prominent Piraeus industrialist, expanded the name to its complete and current status, &quot;Olympiacos Syndesmos Filathlon Pireos&quot;, a name that symbolizes and encompasses the morality, the honour, the vying, the splendor, the sportsmanship and the fair play value of the Olympic ideal of Ancient Greece, which was totally consistent with the club&#x27;s emblem. Besides Kamperos and Manouskos, among the most notable founding members were Stavros Maragoudakis, the Post Office director, Nikos Andronikos, a merchant, Dimitrios Sklias, a Hellenic Army officer, Nikolaos Zacharias, an attorney, Athanasios Mermigas, a notary public, Kostas Klidouchakis, who became the first goalkeeper in the club&#x27;s history, Ioannis Kekkes, a stockbroker, and above all, the Andrianopoulos family. Andrianopoulos, a family of well-established Piraeus merchants, played a pivotal role in the founding of Olympiacos. The five brothers, Yiannis, Giorgos, Dinos, Vassilis and Leonidas Andrianopoulos raised the reputation of the club and brought it to its current glory. Yiannis, Giorgos, Dinos and Vassilis were the first to play, while Leonidas, the youngest of the five, made his debut later on and played for the club for eight years (1927–1935). The club&#x27;s offensive line, made up of the five brothers, became legendary, rising to a mythical status and soon Olympiacos gained enormous popularity and became the most successful and well-supported club in Greece. Olympiacos is also known as &quot;Thrylos&quot; (The Legend), after the legendary, classic side of the 1950s which won a hatful of titles.

=== Team sports ===

=== Football ===



Olympiacos football team is the most successful club in Greek football history, and the only Greek club to have been crowned European Champions by winning UEFA Europa Conference League in 2024. Having won 47 League titles, 28 Cups and 4 Super Cups, all records. Τotalling 79 national trophies, Olympiacos is 9th in the world in total titles won by a football club. The club&#x27;s dominating success can be further evidenced by the fact that all other Greek clubs have won a combined total of 38 League titles, while Olympiacos also holds the record for the most consecutive Greek League titles won, with seven in a row in two occasions (1997–2003 and 2011–2017), breaking their own previous record of six consecutive wins in the 1950s (1954–1959), when Olympiacos was unequivocally nicknamed &quot;Thrylos&quot; (, &quot;The Legend&quot;).

Having won the 2014–15 league title, Olympiacos became the only football club in the world to have won a series of five or more consecutive championships for five times in their history, a record that was praised by FIFA with a congratulatory letter of its president, Sepp Blatter. They are also the only Greek club to have won five consecutive national Cups (1957–1961), as well as six League titles undefeated (1937, 1938, 1948, 1951, 1954, 1955). Olympiacos are one of only three clubs to have never been relegated from the top flight of Greek football, and by winning the 2012–13 title, their 40th in total, they added a fourth star above their crest, each one representing 10 League titles.

Olympiacos is the most successful Greek football club in European competitions, being the only club from Greece to have won a major European trophy; they won the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2023–24, sealing their title by winning against Italian side Fiorentina 1–0 in the Final. With their 2024 triumph, they became the first club outside the biggest four European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga and Bundesliga) to win a UEFA competition since 2011.

As European champions, Olympiacos played in the 1997 McDonald&#x27;s Championship and reached the final of the tournament, where they met Michael Jordan&#x27;s NBA champions, the Chicago Bulls. During the 1990s, besides their constant achievements in EuroLeague, also adding a third place in 1999, Olympiacos dominated the Greek Basket League with five consecutive titles, at a time when the Greek championship was considered Europe&#x27;s best national basketball league. Thus, FIBA declared Olympiacos as the &quot;Best European Team of the 1990s&quot;.

Olympiacos returned to the very top of European basketball in 2010, when they reached the final against Barcelona in Paris, but mostly in 2012, when they won their second EuroLeague title in Istanbul, by rallying from 19 points down in the championship game, to beat CSKA Moscow 62–61, on the last shot of the game, achieving the greatest comeback in European basketball finals history, and one of the greatest ever seen in European continental basketball. In 2013, Olympiacos won their third EuroLeague title and became the only Greek club and only the third club in European basketball history to be crowned back-to-back European champions in the modern EuroLeague Final Four era, after beating Real Madrid 100–88 in the London final.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===

Olympiacos women&#x27;s basketball team was initially founded in 1947, being one of the best women&#x27;s basketball clubs in Greece during the 1950s and the early 1960s, when they won 3 Women&#x27;s Division Center Championships (1956, 1958, 1959), which was the most important competition of Greek women&#x27;s basketball at the time (until 1967–68 when the Greek Women&#x27;s Basketball League was officially organized).

== The gate 7 tragedy ==
The history of the Karaiskakis Stadium and Olympiacos was marked by the worst tragedy that ever hit Greek sports, known as the Karaiskakis Stadium disaster. On 8 February 1981, Olympiacos hosted AEK Athens for a League match, which ended 6–0, in an unprecedented triumph for the host team of Piraeus. During the last minutes of the game, thousands of Olympiacos fans at the Gate 7 rushed to the exit, to get to the stadium&#x27;s main entrance and celebrate with the players, but the doors were almost closed and the turnstiles still in place, making the exit almost impossible. As people continued to come down from the stands, unable to see what happened, the stairs of Gate 7 became a death trap; people were crushed, tens of fans were seriously injured and twenty-one young people died, most of them by suffocation.

In memory of this event, every year on February 8, there is a memorial service at the stadium in honor of the supporters that died in that incident. The service is attended by thousands of fans every year, who are rhythmically shouting the phrase &quot;Αδέλφια, ζείτε, εσείς μας οδηγείτε.&quot; (Adhélfia, zíte, esís mas odhiyíte, &quot;Brothers, you live, you are the ones who guide us.&quot;). At the tribune part of the stadium where Gate 7 is now, some seats are colored black instead of red, shaping the number &quot;7&quot;, whereas there is also a monument on the eastern side of the stadium, bearing the names of all 21 supporters killed on that day in the stadium.

Even though this incident affected almost solely the fanbase of Olympiacos, other teams occasionally pay their respects to the people killed as well, as they consider the incident to be a tragedy not only for one team, but for the whole country. In the past, even foreign teams, such as Liverpool F.C. and Red Star Belgrade have honored the incident&#x27;s victims.

<text>Vivek Anand Oberoi (born 3 September 1976) is an Indian actor and businessman. The son of actor Suresh Oberoi, he began acting in 2002 with starring roles in the Hindi crime film &quot;Company&quot; and romantic drama &quot;Saathiya&quot;. His performances in them were praised and he won two Filmfare Awards for the former. He subsequently had intermittent commercial successes in the comedy &quot;Masti&quot; (2004), horror film &quot;Kaal&quot; (2005) and action film &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot; (2007), while his supporting performance in the dramas &quot;Omkara&quot; (2006) and &quot;Kurbaan&quot; (2009) were praised.

Following a decline, he had commercial success in 2013 with the sequels &quot;Grand Masti&quot; and &quot;Krrish 3&quot;. He has since expanded to South Indian cinema, playing villainous roles in the action films &quot;Vivegam&quot; (2017), &quot;Lucifer&quot; (2019), &quot;Vinaya Vidheya Rama&quot; (2019), and &quot;Kaduva&quot; (2022).

== Early life ==
Vivek Anand Oberoi was born on 3 September 1976 in Hyderabad, Telangana, to a Punjabi father, Suresh Oberoi, an actor. In 1974, Suresh married Yashodhara, who hails from a Punjabi business family settled in Chennai. Because of his mother&#x27;s family being assimilated in the region, Oberoi is himself fluent in Tamil.

Oberoi went on to study at Mayo College, Ajmer and Mithibai College, Mumbai. At an actors&#x27; workshop in London, he was spotted by the director of New York University who took Oberoi to New York, where he completed his master&#x27;s degree in film acting.

== Career ==
=== 2002–2009 ===
Oberoi made his debut with Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s gangster film &quot;Company&quot;. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success. Jyoti Shukla of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; called it a &quot;fast-paced film anchored by brilliant performances.&quot; She praised the performances of Mohanlal, Ajay Devgn, and Oberoi in particular, and said they are &quot;a treat to watch.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;By Bollywood standards, a dark and realistic look at the Mumbai underworld through the battle between a powerful don and his vengeful former sidekick, &quot;Company&quot; manages to cater to Hindi cinema norms while feeding the viewer something a little different.&quot; In 2010, Raja Sen wrote in his review: &quot;This finely plotted duel between two gangsters left us battered, bruised and craving more&quot;. The film earned him two Filmfare Awards for Best Male Debut and Best Supporting Actor. The same year, he starred in the action films &quot;Road&quot; and &quot;Dum&quot;. He ended 2002 with the romantic drama &quot;Saathiya&quot; alongside Rani Mukerji. The film was a critical and commercial success and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

In 2004, he starred in the comedy &quot;Masti&quot; and the political thriller &quot;Yuva&quot;, both of which emerged as critical and commercial successes. In 2005, he played the title character in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

In 2006, Oberoi appeared in the crime drama &quot;Omkara&quot;, Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;, playing the character of Kesu, based on the character Michael Cassio in the original play. After seeing Oberoi&#x27;s performance, Gulzar congratulated him.

In 2007, Oberoi played the gangster Maya Dolas in &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot;. The film earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Villain.

In 2008, Oberoi starred in &quot;Mission Istanbul&quot;, directed by Apoorva Lakhia and produced by Ekta Kapoor. He performed to the song &quot;Apun Ke Saath&quot;, produced for the film by Vikas Kohli, at the 2008 International Indian Film Academy Awards. It received negative reviews from critics. &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; critic Taran Adarsh gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars. &quot;The Hindu&quot; stated that &quot;Mission Istaanbul&quot; has no sting. Rediff.com gave it 1 star.

In 2009, Oberoi starred with Kareena Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Om Puri, Kirron Kher and Dia Mirza in the romantic thriller &quot;Kurbaan&quot;, directed by Rensil D&#x27;Silva and produced by Dharma Productions. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its direction, screenplay, soundtrack, and performances of the cast, with particular praise directed towards Kapoor&#x27;s performance. However, despite critical acclaim, it was declared a flop by &quot;Box Office India&quot;.

=== 2010–2019 ===

In 2010, Oberoi appeared in &quot;Prince&quot;, which failed to receive a good response from the audience, despite a good opening. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; rated it 3 out of 5, saying &quot;&quot;Prince&quot; has all merits to strike a chord with the youth&quot;, praising Oberoi&#x27;s &#x27;bravura&#x27; performance, the film&#x27;s &#x27;Hollywood style&#x27; look and action sequences, as well as the music. Noyon Jyoti Parasara of &quot;AOL India&quot; gave 3 out of 5, saying, &quot;once you are willing to let go off your beliefs and logic – like you really can&#x27;t jump off a cliff on your bike and remain unscratched – you would like the film.&quot; On the other hand, Omar Qureshi of &quot;Zoom&quot; rated &quot;Prince&quot; 2.5 out of 5, saying, &quot;The film is over-the-top and unrealistic.&quot; &quot;Indiatimes.com&quot; rated it 2 out of 5 stars saying, &quot;The film has taken the audience for granted, which shows us gadgets hard to believe and futuristic and that such futuristic shows should be limited to Hollywood.&quot;. Subhash K. Jha gave 2 out of 5 stars, and said, &quot;&quot;Prince&quot; wears its super-cool shirt with the slogan &#x27;Come Watch Me&#x27; with a little bit too much aggression. But if you love popcorn crunching adventure stories watch Vivek Oberoi play the hero from the hemisphere of hijinks.&quot; He praised Oberoi&#x27;s acting and the action sequences, saying that &quot;To his credit, Oberoi carries off the ceaseless stint with the stunt with arresting aplomb[...]The expertly-executed stunts frequently see our hero jumping down high-rise buildings in breathtaking leaps of fate, with the camera pulling back in respectful awe.&quot;

In the same year, he appeared in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Rakht Charitra&quot; playing the role of the Telugu politician Paritala Ravi. Oberoi&#x27;s performance in the role of Paritala Ravi drew widespread praise, while Abhimanyu Singh&#x27;s devious turn as Bukka Reddy, modelled on the real-life Obul Reddy, was regarded as one of the most terrifying villainous acts captured on celluloid in a long time. Renuka Rao of DNA India gave the movie 4 stars in a scale of 5, concluding that RGV has surprisingly thrown at the audience a film that could actually evoke some emotions in you. A must, must watch.&quot; Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4 stars in a scale of 5, saying that &quot;On the whole, RAKHT CHARITRA is not for the faint-hearted or the lily-livered. The violence, the blood and gore depicted in the film will shock and disconcert you, which only goes to establish as to how proficiently the subject material has been treated.&quot; Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;Times of India&quot; gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, stating that &quot;Rakta Charitra holds up a brutal mirror on the muck that masquerades as democracy in India.&quot; Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, noting that &quot;Rakta Charitra is a bold, disturbing film that&#x27;s bursting with the kind of confidence we haven&#x27;t seen from the filmmaker recently. If the sight of blood doesn&#x27;t make you uncomfortable, chances are you&#x27;ll enjoy this film.&quot;

Oberoi produced a film named &quot;Dekh Indian Circus&quot; in 2011. The film was featured in the 16th Busan Film festival, winning the Audience Choice Award for Best Film from 3000 films worldwide and amongst 380 films screened. In 16 years of the history of Busan, this is the First Indian Film to win the award. The film has already received rave reviews from international critics and reporters from &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Screen International&quot;. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from the critics. Richard Kuipers of &quot;Variety&quot; praised it for &quot;bringing the themes of inequality and class divisions together in the highly entertaining visit to the big top.&quot; Kirk Honeycutt in his review for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, praised director Mangesh Hadawale for portraying third-world issues through a family comedy that contains a stinging satire of contemporary India and its rampant corruption.

Oberoi&#x27;s film &quot;Kismat Love Paisa Dilli&quot;, which was released in October 2012, failed to impress the audience and was a box office failure.

He also played supervillain Kaal in &quot;Krrish 3&quot; (2013). Critics directed praise towards cast performances (particularly Hrithik Roshan, Kangana Ranaut and Oberoi), VFX, cinematography, background score, direction and entertainment value, but criticism has been directed towards the film&#x27;s lack of originality, soundtrack and writing. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated that &quot;the film has all the ingredients that make a splendid superhero film, besides being Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s most accomplished work so far.&quot; Madhureeta Mukherjee of &quot;The Times of India&quot; gave it 4.5 stars while commenting &quot;For sheer vision, bravado and superlative execution, this one soars to new orbits. Latch on to this cape for an exhilarating ride.&quot; Raedita Tandan of &quot;Filmfare&quot; awarded it 4 out of 5 stars, remarking &quot;Hats off to Rakesh Roshan for dreaming big and actually pulling off this risky proposition. It&#x27;s not perfect. But it has all the elements a good, entertaining film must have. All you Marvel superheroes, better watch out. Krrish is here to stay.&quot; Anupama Chopra of the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; gave it 3.5 stars and said, &quot;Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan deserves a round of applause for giving us a homegrown superhero. Krrish 3 is ambitious and exciting.&quot; Sarita Tanwar of &quot;DNA&quot; gave it 3.5 stars and wrote, &quot;Krrish 3 is fast-paced and the VFX effects are smashing.&quot; Rohit Khilnani of &quot;India Today&quot; gave it 3.5 stars noting, &quot;The only part where the movie dips are during the songs. The music sounds too dated for this action-packed film.&quot; The film earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Oberoi dubbed the voice of Electro in the Hindi-dubbed version of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, which was released in May 2014.

In 2017, Oberoi made his Tamil debut in supporting role alongside Ajith Kumar in action thriller film &quot;Vivegam&quot;. The film received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;The Times of India&quot; rated the film 3 out of 5 and said &quot;Vivegam is an over-the-top but engaging action thriller with a calculated mix of brawn and brain, action and sentiment, smartly pandering to fans while giving families something to connect with.&quot; NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and cited &quot;Ajith Is Charismatic But Let Down By Silly Scenes&quot;. &quot;Behindwoods&quot; rated the film 2.25 out of 5, stating, &quot;Vivegam – High on production value and action. Heavily dependent on Ajith&#x27;s persona, engagement factor takes a beating&quot;. Mirchi9 gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying &quot;Overall, Vivekam is for the fans and fans alone for whom just watching the star on screen is enough. There is ample style and punch dialogues with a healthy dose of action. For everyone else, it is an utterly boring film&quot;. &quot;Nowrunning&quot; rated the film 1.5/5 and said &quot;Director Siva had collected a bunch of Spy movies from Hollywood and made a mashup of them. He picked up all the action blocks and combined it with loud background score which will only irk the audience. Even the action is also missing in the second half and there is no logic at all. The climax is stretched further which disappoints the audience&quot;. The film earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor – Tamil.

Oberoi worked with YRF banner&#x27;s film &quot;Bank Chor&quot;, with Rhea Chakraborty and Riteish Deshmukh.

He also appeared in Ram Charan starrer Telugu film &quot;Vinaya Vidheya Rama&quot; (2019), It received negative reviews from critics and became a box-office bomb, which prompted Charan to issue an apology letter. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; gave 1 out of 5 stars stating &quot;Vinaya Vidheya Rama is like watching a Balakrishna action film on steroids. Clumsy and unconvincing screenplay&quot;. &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; gave 1.5 out of 5 stars stating &quot;If there is a plot and a story that is worth a notice, then it is lost between all the fights, songs, dances and random elevation dialogues&quot;. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; gave 0.5 out of 5 stars stating &quot;The film itself feels dated. It is a mess that even Ram Charan – with all the weird stunts -- cannot punch his way out of&quot;. &quot;Firstpost&quot; gave 1.5 out of 5 stars stating &quot;Realism has absolutely no place in the world of Vinaya Vidheya Rama&quot;.

In 2019, Oberoi made his Malayalam debut with Mohanlal in Prithviraj Sukumaran&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, as the main antagonist, Bobby, in which his performance as a villain was well received by critics and the audience. &quot;Times of India&quot; gave the film 3.5 out of 5 writing &quot;Lucifer is a &#x27;mass entertainer&#x27; that is sure to please the fans and has enough going for to make it an engaging thriller as well. And apart from the mandatory Stan Lee, correction, Antony Perumbavoor cameo, watch out for Stephen&#x27;s second avatar in the film.&quot;

He has featured as a talent judge for three seasons of the reality show India&#x27;s Best Dramebaaz. He portrayed the role of India&#x27;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in &quot;PM Narendra Modi&quot;. The film was universally panned by critics, who termed it a hagiography and criticised Oberoi&#x27;s performance. Renuka Vyavahare of &quot;The Times of India&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of five and criticised the script, opining, &quot;This one is too lopsided for you to appreciate. It leaves a lot unanswered. While it firmly believes &#x27;Modi ek insaan nahi, soch hai&#x27;, we wish the script was as thoughtful&quot;. However, she was among the few who appreciated Oberoi&#x27;s performance- &quot;He gets the mannerisms, accent and tone right and thankfully doesn&#x27;t overdo it&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, Shubhra Gupta gave the movie two stars out of five and stated, &quot;The film is not a mere bio-pic, it is a full-fledged, unabashed, unapologetic hagiography&quot;. Kennith Rosario of &quot;The Hindu&quot; summarised the movie&#x27;s narrative as &quot;a obsequious love letter&quot; to the protagonist which tells the audience &quot;how sincere, hardworking, fair and honest Modi is, [and] that it makes you wonder if life is a parody of this film&quot;.

===2022–present===
In 2022, he starred in Malayalam language film &quot;Kaduva&quot; opposite Prithviraj Sukumaran. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. Sajin Shrijith of &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; found Oberoi&#x27;s character to be &quot;basic&quot;. He also starred in a short film, &quot;Verses of War&quot;.

He then starred in MX Player series &quot;Dharavi Bank&quot; alongside Suniel Shetty.

== Personal life ==
Oberoi&#x27;s full first name, Vivekanand, is based on that of the Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda; his father and grandfathers were followers of the monk. He says he dropped Anand when he joined Film out of respect for Vivekananda, as he considered it would be embarrassing romancing and dancing on screen with the name of the monk. Oberoi credits Kareena Kapoor as his inspiration for adopting a vegetarian diet.

Oberoi dated his &quot;Kyun! Ho Gaya Na...&quot; co-star Aishwarya Rai. In 2003, Oberoi claimed that Rai&#x27;s former boyfriend, Salman Khan, had threatened him. In 2005, Oberoi and Rai broke up.
On 29 October 2010, Oberoi married Priyanka Alva, daughter of Karnataka minister Jeevaraj Alva, in Bangalore. The couple have a son and a daughter.

In 2021, he donated Rs 25 lakh to the fund created to overcome the shortage of oxygen cylinders in hospitals.

<text>Glycophorin C (GYPC; CD236/CD236R; glycoprotein beta; glycoconnectin; PAS-2″) plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane material properties, possibly through its interaction with protein 4.1. Moreover, it has previously been shown that membranes deficient in protein 4.1 exhibit decreased content of glycophorin C. It is also an integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte and acts as the receptor for the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; protein PfEBP-2 (erythrocyte binding protein 2; baebl; EBA-140).

==History==

The antigen was discovered in 1960 when three women who lacked the antigen made anti-Gea in response to pregnancy. The antigen is named after one of the patients – a Mrs Gerbich. The following year a new but related antigen was discovered in a Mrs Yus for whom an antigen in this system is also named. In 1972 a numerical system for the antigens in this blood group was introduced.

== Genomics ==

Despite the similar names glycophorin C and D are unrelated to the other three glycophorins which encoded on chromosome 4 at location 4q28-q31. These latter proteins are closely related. Glycophorin A and glycophorin B carry the blood group MN and Ss antigens respectively. There are ~225,000 molecules of GPC and GPD per erythrocyte.

Originally it was thought that glycophorin C and D were the result of a gene duplication event but it was only later realised that they were encoded by the same gene. Glycophorin D (GPD) is generated from the glycophorin C messenger RNA by leaky translation at an in frame AUG at codon 30: glycophorin D = glycophorin C residues 30 to 128. This leaky translation appears to be a uniquely human trait.

Glycophorin C (GPC) is a single polypeptide chain of 128 amino acids and is encoded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q14-q21). The gene was first cloned in 1989 by High &quot;et al.&quot; The GPC gene is organized in four exons distributed over 13.5 kilobase pairs of DNA. Exon 1 encodes residues 1-16, exon 2 residues 17-35, exon 3 residues 36-63 and exon 4 residues 64-128. Exons 2 and 3 are highly homologous, with less than 5% nucleotide divergence. These exons also differ by a 9 amino acid insert at the 3&#x27; end of exon 3. The direct repeated segments containing these exons is 3.4 kilobase pairs long and may be derived from a recent duplication of a single ancestral domain. Exons 1, 2 and most of exon 3 encode the N-terminal extracellular domain while the remainder of exon 3 and exon 4 encode transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

Two isoforms are known and the gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including kidney, thymus, stomach, breast, adult liver and erythrocyte. In the non erythroid cell lines, expression is lower than in the erythrocyte and the protein is differentially glycosylated. In the erythrocyte glycophorin C makes up ~4% of the membrane sialoglycoproteins. The average number of O linked chains is 12 per molecule.

The gene is expressed early in the development of the erythrocyte, specifically in the erythroid burst-forming unit and erythroid colony-forming unit. The mRNA from human erythroblasts is ~1.4 kilobases long and the transcription start site in erythroid cells has been mapped to 1050 base pairs 5&#x27; of the start codon. It is expressed early in development and before the Kell antigens, Rhesus-associated glycoprotein, glycophorin A, band 3, the Rhesus antigen and glycophorin B.

In melanocytic cells Glycophorin C gene expression may be regulated by MITF.

GPC appears to be synthesized in excess in the erythrocyte and that the membrane content is regulated by band 4.1 (protein 4.1). Additional data on the regulation of glycophorin C is here.

In a study of this gene among the Hominoidea two finding unique to humans emerged: (1) an excess of non-synonymous divergence among species that appears to be caused solely by accelerated evolution and (2) the ability of the single GYPC gene to encode both the GPC and GPD proteins. The cause for this is not known but it was suggested that these findings might be the result of infection by &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;.

== Molecular biology ==

After separation of red cell membranes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) four glycophorins have been identified. These have been named glycophorin A, B, C and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane – glycophorin A being the most and glycophorin D the least common. A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining. In total the glycophorins constitute ~2% of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass. Confusingly these proteins are also known under different nomenclatures but they are probably best known as the glycophorins.

Glycophorin C was first isolated in 1978. Glycophorin C and D are minor sialoglycoproteins contributing to 4% and 1% to the PAS-positive material and are present at about 2.0 and 0.5 x 105 copies/cell respectively. In polyacrylimide gels glycophorin C&#x27;s apparent weight is 32 kilodaltons (32 kDa). Its structure is similar to that of other glycophorins: a highly glycoslated extracellular domain (residues 1-58), a transmembrane domain (residues 59-81) and an intracellular domain (residues 82-128). About 90% of the glycophorin C present in the erythrocyte is bound to the cytoskeleton and the remaining 10% moves freely within the membrane.

Glycophorin D&#x27;s apparent molecular weight is 23kDa. On average this protein has 6 O linked oligosaccharides per molecule.

Within the erythrocyte it interacts with band 4.1 (an 80-kDa protein) and p55 (a palmitoylated peripheral membrane phosphoprotein and a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family) to form a ternary complex that is critical for the shape and stability of erythrocytes. The major attachment sites between the erythrocyte spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer are glycophorin C and band 3. The interaction with band 4.1 and p55 is mediated by the N terminal 30 kD domain of band 4.1 binding to a 16 amino acid segment (residues 82-98: residues 61-77 of glycophorin D) within the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C and to a positively charged 39 amino acid motif in p55. The majority of protein 4.1 is bound to glycophorin C. The magnitude of the strength of the interaction between glycophorin C and band 4.1 has been estimated to be 6.9 microNewtons per meter, a figure typical of protein–protein interactions.

Glycophorin C normally shows oscillatory movement in the erythrocyte membrane. This is reduced in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis a disease of erythrocytes due to a mutation in band 3.

==Transfusion medicine==

These glycophorins are associated with eleven antigens of interest to transfusion medicine: the Gerbich (Ge2, Ge3, Ge4), the Yussef (Yus), the Webb (Wb or Ge5), the Duch (Dh(a) or Ge8), the Leach, the Lewis II (Ls(a) or Ge6), the Ahonen (An(a) or Ge7) and GEPL (Ge10*), GEAT (Ge11*) and GETI (Ge12*). Six are of high prevalence (Ge2, Ge3, Ge4, Ge10*, Ge11*, Ge12*) and five of low prevalence (Wb, Ls(a), An(a), Dh(a) and Ge9).

===Gerbich antigen===

Glycophorin C and D encode the Gerbich (Ge) antigens. There are four alleles, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3 (Leach phenotype), Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. A 3.4 kilobase pair deletion within the gene, which probably arose because of unequal crossing over between the two repeated domains, is responsible for the formation of the Ge-2,-3 genotype. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3. This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2,-3 red cells. A second 3.4 kilobase pair deletion within the glycophorin C gene eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes.

The Ge2 epitope is antigenic only on glycophorin D and is a cryptic antigen in glycophorin C. It is located within exon 2 and is sensitive to trypsin and papain but resistant to chymotrypsin and pronase. The Ge3 epitope is encoded by exon 3. It is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin, papain and pronase. It is thought to lie in the between amino acids 42-50 in glycophorin C (residues 21-49 in glycophorin D). Ge4 is located within the first 21 amino acids of glycophorin C. It is sensitive to trypsin, papain, pronase and neuraminidase.

===Leach antigen===

The relatively rare Leach phenotype is due either to a deletion in exons 3 and 4 or to a frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon in the glycophorin C gene, and persons with this phenotype are less susceptible (~60% of the control rate) to invasion by &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. Such individuals have a subtype of a condition called hereditary elliptocytosis. 
The abnormally shaped cells are known as elliptocytes or cameloid cells. The basis for this phenotype was first reported by Telen &quot;et al.&quot; The phenotype is Ge:-2,-3,-4.

===Yussef antigen===

The Yussef (Yus) phenotype is due to a 57 base pair deletion corresponding to exon 2. The antigen is known as GPC Yus.

Glycophorin C mutations are rare in most of the Western world, but are more common in some places where malaria is endemic. In Melanesia a greater percentage of the population is Gerbich negative (46.5%) than in any other part of the world. The incidence of Gerbich-negative phenotype caused by an exon 3 deletion in the Wosera (East Sepik Province) and Liksul (Madang Province) populations of Papua New Guinea is 0.463 and 0.176 respectively.

===Webb antigen===

The rare Webb (Wb) antigen (~1/1000 donors), originally described in 1963 in Australia, is the result of an alteration in glycosylation of glycophorin C: an A to G transition at nucleotide 23 results in an asparagine residue instead of the normal serine residue with the resultant loss of glycosylation. The antigen is known as GPC Wb.

===Duch antigen===

The rare Duch (Dh) antigen was discovered in Aarhus, Denmark (1968) and is also found on glycophorin C. It is due to a C to T transition at nucleotide 40 resulting in the replacement of leucine by phenylalanine. This antigen is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin and Endo F.

===Lewis antigen===

The Lewis II (Ls(a); Ge-6) antigen has insert of 84 nucleotides into the ancestral GPC gene: the insert corresponds to the entire sequence of exon 3. Two subtypes of this antigen are known: beta Ls(a) which carries the Ge3 epitope and gamma Ls(a) which carries both the Ge2 and Ge3 epitopes. This antigen is also known as the Rs(a) antigen.

===Ahonen antigen===

The Ahonen (Ana) antigen was first reported in 1972.
The antigen is found on glycophorin D. This antigen was discovered in a Finnish man on May 5, 1968, during post operative blood cross matching for an aortic aneurism repair. In Finland the incidence of this antigen was found to be 6/10,000 donors. In Sweden the incidence was 2/3266 donors. The molecular basis for the origin of this antigen lies within exon 2 where a G-&gt;T substitution in codon 67 (base position 199) converts an alanine to a serine residue. While this epitope exists within glycophorin C there it is a cryptantigen. It is only antigenic in glycophorin D because of the truncated N terminus.

===Others===

A duplicated exon 2 has erythrocytes also been reported in Japanese blood donors (~2/10,000). This mutation has not been associated with a new antigen.

===Antibodies===

Antibodies to the Gerbich antigens have been associated with transfusion reactions and mild hemolytic disease of the newborn. 
In other studies naturally occurring anti-Ge antibodies have been found and appear to be of no clinical significance. Immunological tolerance towards Ge antigen has been suggested.

==Other areas==

High expression of glycophorin C has been associated with a poor prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Chinese populations.

Glycophorin C is the receptor for the protein erythrocyte binding antigen 140 (EBA140) of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. This interaction mediates a principal invasion pathway into the erythrocytes. The partial resistance of erythrocytes lacking this protein to invasion by &quot;P. falciparum&quot; was first noted in 1982. The lack of Gerbich antigens in the population of Papua New Guinea was noted in 1989.

Influenza A and B bind to glycophorin C.

<doc id="979521" wikidata="Q704" url="?curid=979521" title="Olympique Lyonnais">
<text>Olympique Lyonnais (), commonly referred to as simply Lyon () or OL, is a French professional football club based in Lyon, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. With origins dating back to 1899, they were founded in 1950 and provisionally compete in France&#x27;s highest football division, Ligue 1. The club won its first Ligue 1 championship in 2002, beginning a national record-setting streak of seven successive titles. Lyon has also won eight Trophées des Champions, five Coupes de France, and three Ligue 2 titles.

The team has participated in the UEFA Champions League seventeen times, and during the 2009–10 season reached the semi-finals of the competition for the first time after three previous quarter-final appearances. They once again reached this stage in the 2019–20 season. Olympique Lyonnais plays its home matches at the 59,186-seat Parc Olympique Lyonnais, commercially known as the Groupama Stadium, in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon. The club&#x27;s home colors are white, red and blue. Lyon was a member of the G14 group of leading European football clubs and are founder members of its successor, the European Club Association.

The club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Les Gones&quot;, means &quot;The Kids&quot; in Lyon&#x27;s regional dialect of Franco-Provençal. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby team
Saint-Étienne, against whom they contest the Derby Rhône-Alpes. French businessman Jean-Michel Aulas owned Lyon from June 1987 until it was purchased by American businessman John Textor in December 2022.

==History==
Olympique Lyonnais was initially formed under the multisports club Lyon Olympique Universitaire, which was originally formed in 1896 as &quot;Racing Club de Lyon&quot;. In 1899, &quot;Olympique de Lyon&quot; formed a football team within the multisport club. During the early years of the club, the football section was often overshadowed by then-local rivals FC Lyon. Following numerous internal disagreements regarding the cohabitation of amateurs and professionals within the club, then-manager of the club Félix Louot and his entourage contemplated forming their own club. On 26 May 1950, Louot&#x27;s plan came to fruition when Olympique Lyonnais was officially founded by Dr. Albert Trillat and numerous others. The club&#x27;s first manager was Oscar Heisserer and, on 26 August 1950, played its first official match defeating CA Paris-Charenton 3–0 in front of 3,000 supporters. In just the club&#x27;s second year of existence, Lyon was crowned champion of the second division, securing promotion to the first division. The club maintained its first division place for the remainder of the decade, excluding a year&#x27;s stint in the second division for the 1953–54 season.

Lyon achieved moderate success during the 1960s and 1970s with the likes of Fleury Di Nallo, Néstor Combin, Serge Chiesa, Bernard Lacombe and Jean Djorkaeff playing major roles. Under manager Lucien Jasseron, Lyon won its first-ever Coupe de France title defeating Bordeaux 2–0 during the 1963–64 season. The club also performed respectably in the league under Jasseron&#x27;s reign until the 1965–66 season, when Lyon finished 16th, which ultimately led to Jasseron&#x27;s departure. His replacement was Louis Hon, who helped Lyon win their second Coupe de France title after defeating Sochaux 3–1 during the 1966–67 season.
Lyon was managed by former Lyon legend Aimé Mignot heading into the 1970s. Under Mignot&#x27;s helm, Lyon won its third Coupe de France title during the 1972–73 season, beating Nantes 2–1.

In June 1987, Lyon was bought by Rhône businessman Jean-Michel Aulas who took control of the club aiming to turn Lyon into an established Ligue 1 side. His ambitious plan, titled &quot;OL – Europe&quot;, was designed to develop the club at the European level and back into the first division within a period of no more than four years. The first manager under the new hierarchy was Raymond Domenech. The aspiring chairman gave Domenech &quot;carte blanche&quot; to recruit whoever he saw fit to help the team reach the first division. They went on to accomplish this in Domenech&#x27;s first season in charge. Lyon achieved its zenith under Domenech when it qualified for the UEFA Cup. For the remainder of his tenure, however, the club underachieved. Domenech was replaced by former French international Jean Tigana, who led the team to an impressive second place in the 1994–95 season.

At the start of the new millennium, Lyon began to achieve greater success in French football. The club established itself as the premiere club in France, defeating Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain, and also became France&#x27;s richest club. Lyon became known for developing promising talent who went on to achieve greatness not only in France, but also abroad and internationally. Notable examples include Michael Essien, Florent Malouda, Sidney Govou, Juninho, Cris, Eric Abidal, Mahamadou Diarra, Patrick Müller and Karim Benzema. Lyon won its first ever Ligue 1 title in 2002, starting a national record-breaking streak of seven successive titles. During that run the club also won one Coupe de France title, its first Coupe de la Ligue title and a record six Trophée des Champions. The club also performed well in UEFA competitions, reaching as far as the quarter-finals on three occasions and the semi-finals in 2010 in the UEFA Champions League. Lyon&#x27;s streak and consistent dominance of French football came to an end during the 2008–09 season, when it lost the title to Bordeaux.

OL began investment in sports outside of football. OL operates an esports team in China, and in 2019 purchased a minority stake in the local ASVEL basketball club, specifically purchasing a 25% interest in ASVEL&#x27;s men&#x27;s side and a 10% interest in the women&#x27;s side.

OL announced in December 2019 that it would buy an 89.5% stake in the U.S. National Women&#x27;s Soccer League team known at the time as Reign FC. The purchase closed in January 2020 following approval of the NWSL board. Several weeks later, OL announced the rebranding of Reign FC as OL Reign.

In the 2019–20 season, Lyon suffered a poor start to the season, and ended the season in seventh place, as the league was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Lyon also reached the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, however, they eventually lost to Paris Saint-Germain 6–5 on penalties. Ultimately, this meant that Lyon failed to qualify for European competition for the first time in 24 years. In the Champions League, Lyon were more successful, defeating Juventus in the round of 16 and Manchester City in the quarter-final to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 10 years. However, they eventually lost 3–0 in the semi-final to Bayern Munich, eliminating Lyon from the competition. Two seasons later, Lyon competed in the 2021–22 Europa League season, eventually being knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals by West Ham 4–1 on aggregate.

On 16 September 2023, Italian coach Fabio Grosso, who is also a former player of the club, was appointed head of the first team. In October 2023, OL&#x27;s team busses were attacked in Marseille which forced the postponement of the game. Head manager Grosso was injured in the attack. With the club last in the Ligue 1 table, the team&#x27;s management announced at the end of November 2023 that Grosso was fired after being in charge for just seven games. Academy coach Pierre Sage was named as the team&#x27;s interim coach who led the team to finish in sixth place, qualifying Lyon to compete in the 2024–25 Europa League season having spent the two previous seasons out of European tournaments. In July 2024, Sage&#x27;s interim status was removed and he was named the new permanent coach. On 27 January 2025, Sage was sacked as Lyon manager and replaced by Portuguese coach Paulo Fonseca days later on 31 January 2025.

==Ownership and finances==
Olympique Lyonnais was owned by Rhône businessman Jean-Michel Aulas, who acquired the club on 15 June 1987. He serves as the founder and chief operating officer of CEGID (Compagnie Européenne de Gestion par l&#x27;Informatique Décentralisée). After ridding the club of its debt, Aulas restructured the club&#x27;s management and reorganised the finances and, in a span of two decades, transformed the club from a second division team into one of the richest football clubs in the world. However, Aulas has been lambasted by critics for running the club as if it were a business. During this period, the club&#x27;s holding company operated on the European Stock Exchange under the name OL Groupe, initialled OLG. Aulas currently serves on the board for the European Club Association, a sports organisation representing football clubs in Europe. He was also the last president of the now-defunct G-14 organisation.

In April 2008, business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Lyon as the thirteenth most valuable football team in the world. The magazine valued the club at $408 million (€275.6M), excluding debt. In February 2009, Lyon were rated in the 12th spot in the Deloitte Football Money League, reportedly bringing in an annual revenue of €155.7 million for the 2007–08 season, which ranks among the world&#x27;s best football clubs in terms of revenue.

In 2016, a Chinese private equity fund acquired 20% stake in Olympique Lyonnais Group for €100 million. The fund was managed by IDG Capital Partners. 

In December 2022, American businessman John Textor completed the purchase of the club, owning 77.49% of the club&#x27;s shares and thus becomes the new owner of the club. Under this arrangement, the club suggested that Aulas would continue to serve as president for at least three more seasons. However, on 8 May 2023, it was announced that Textor had replaced Aulas to become the chairman and CEO of OL Groupe, thus making him the new president of Olympique Lyonnais, ending Aulas&#x27; 36 years rule, during which more than 50 major titles have been won for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. Jean-Michel Aulas was appointed honorary chairman, and &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; reported that Aulas would be compensated €10 million for his exit and retain a 9% stake in the club.

On 13 July 2023, Frenchman Santiago Cucci was named to become the new interim executive president of OL Groupe, but later ressigned in November.

The debts owed by the club increased by around €50 million in 2024, and on 15 November 2024, Lyon were threatened with a provisional relegation to Ligue 2 and a transfer ban if their outstanding debts are not paid off before the end of the 2024–25 season.

:&quot;As of 13 July 2023.&quot;
==Stadium==

Olympique Lyonnais used to play at the Stade de Gerland from 1950, the year the club was founded. In 1910, the mayor of Lyon, Édouard Herriot, came up with the idea to develop and build a sports stadium with an athletics track and a velodrome in the city. In 1912, the stadium was officially mandated and local architect Tony Garnier was given the reins in designing and constructing it. Construction began in 1914 with the hope that the stadium would be completed before the International Exhibition of 1914. Construction was halted due to the First World War, but construction was eventually completed in 1919. By 1920, the stadium was completely functional. In 1926, the Stade de Gerland was inaugurated by Herriot.

Olympique Lyonnais began playing at the Gerland in 1950 and remained at the stadium until 2016. The stadium originally had a cycling track, but was removed to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations were made to the stadium by architect Rene Gagis. This included construction of the Jean Bouin and Jean Jaurès stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as by that time FIFA had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the World Cup, had to be all-seated. The north and south stands, known as the Jean Jaurès and Jean Bouin stand, respectively, were completely knocked down and rebuilt, and the athletics track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland had a maximum capacity of 40,500.

On 1 September 2008, Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas announced plans to create a new 60,000-seater stadium, tentatively called &quot;OL Land&quot;, to be built on 50 hectares of land located in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon. The stadium includes state-of-the-art sporting facilities, two hotels, a leisure center and commercial and business offices.

On 13 October 2008, the project was agreed upon by the State, the General Council of Rhône, the Grand Lyon, SYTRAL and the municipality of Décines for construction with approximately €180 million of public money being used and between €60–80 million coming from the Urban Community of Lyon. After the announcement, however, the club&#x27;s efforts to get the stadium off the ground were hindered mainly due to slow administrative procedures, political interests and various opposition groups, who viewed the stadium as financially, ecologically and socially wrong for the taxpayers and community of Décines. The official name of the stadium was provisionally to be &quot;Le Stade des Lumières&quot;.

On 22 September 2009, French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; reported that &quot;OL Land&quot; had been selected by the French Football Federation (FFF) as one of the 12 stadiums to be used in the country&#x27;s bidding for UEFA Euro 2016. The FFF officially made their selections on 11 November 2009 and the city of Lyon was selected as a site to host matches during the tournament.

The first game played in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais took place on 9 January 2016. Olympique Lyonnais beat Troyes 4–1 with goals from Alexandre Lacazette, Rachid Ghezzal, Jordan Ferri and Claudio Beauvue.

==Training centre==
The Centre Tola Vologe was the training centre and club headquarters of Olympique Lyonnais before the move to their new stadium in 2016. It is located in the city of Lyon, not far from the Stade de Gerland. The facility is named after Anatole Vologe, commonly called Tola Vologe, who was a Lyon sportsman and was murdered by the Gestapo during World War II. The facility is known for its high-level training and several prominent players have passed through the youth training centre. These include Karim Benzema, Hatem Ben Arfa, Sidney Govou, Alexandre Lacazette, Samuel Umtiti and Ludovic Giuly. The centre used to host training sessions for the senior team and also served as the home facility for the club&#x27;s reserve, youth (both male and female), and female sides, who both played their home matches at the Plaine des Jeux de Gerland. Jean-François Vulliez is the current director of the centre.

Both the men and women teams now train within a modern complex right by the new Groupama Stadium in Décines. The youth Academy also moved to the neighbouring town of Meyzieu.

==Colours and kits==

Since the club&#x27;s foundation, the primary colours have been red, blue, and white, with the latter being the most predominant of the three. During the early years of the club&#x27;s existence, Olympique Lyonnais primarily played in all-white uniforms. In 1955, Lyon officials decided to add a red and blue chevron and blue shorts to the combination. In 1961, the chevron tradition was disbanded and the two strips of red and blue were shaped horizontally. After six years, the club returned to the all-white uniforms, but kept intact the red and blue stripes, but, instead of keeping them horizontally, inserted them vertically and on the left side of the shirt. Lyon began wearing the shirt during the 1970–71 season and wore the kits up until the 1975–76 season. For the 2002–03 season, chairman Jean-Michel Aulas announced that the club would return the kits. Lyon wore them, with several different modifications every year, for six of their seven consecutive titles.

In 1976, the club endured a drastic change to their kits, ditching the all-white uniforms for an all-red style, akin to English club Liverpool. The club wore the kits up until the 1989–90 season, with the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons being excluded due to the club adding navy blue vertical stripes to the shirt that was deemed unsuccessful. Following the 1989–90 season, the club returned to the all-white kits and, at the start of the 1995–96 season, the club returned the vertical stripes, but opted to insert them in the center of the shirt, instead of to the left. The club kept this style until the 2001–02 season. For the 2009–10 season, Lyon returned the horizontal red and blue stripes. In the Champions League, Lyon has used a variety of different colours as first choice, including red, navy blue, light blue, black, silver and fluorescent yellow.

==Supporters==
Olympique Lyonnais has an active fanbase composed of many groups of supporters. One of the club&#x27;s most notable supporters group is &quot;Bad Gones&quot; (&quot;Bad Kids&quot;). The &quot;Bad Gones&quot; were established in 1987 around the time of Jean-Michel Aulas&#x27;s purchase of the team and used to occupy the Virage Nord area of the Stade de Gerland, and currently occupy the Virage Nord area of the Parc Olympique Lyonnais. During the 2007–08 season, the group celebrated its 20th anniversary. The &quot;Bad Gones&quot; is the biggest group of supporters in France and have a very strong reputation in Europe, due to the club&#x27;s control of Ligue 1, as well as Lyon&#x27;s continued appearances in the UEFA Champions League.

Another notable supporters group is the &quot;Cosa Nostra Lyon&quot;, who occupy the Virage Sud area of the stadium. The group was created in 2007 as a result of a merger between two groups, the &quot;Lugdunums&quot;, which had existed since 1993 and &quot;Nucleo Ultra&quot;, which formed in 2000. The merger was created to achieve a sense of stability among supporters. The group is no longer recognised by the club, but continues to operate in a functional manner. Other support groups include the &quot;Hex@gones&quot;, which was formed in 2000 and sit in the Virage Sud area, the &quot;Gastrogones&quot;, who occupy the Jean Bouin stand, and the &quot;O&#x27;Elles Club&quot;, who sit in the Jean Jaurès stand.

The club also has support groups that are based in areas outside of the city of Lyon. The &quot;Gones 58&quot; supporters come from the department of Nièvre in Bourgogne, while &quot;Gones 26&quot; origins come from the department of Drôme in nearby Valence. Three minor support groups in &quot;Septimagones&quot;, &quot;Loups Marchois&quot;, and &quot;Dauphigones&quot; comes from the commune of Hérépian, the department of Creuse, and the department of Isère, respectively. Outside of France, the &quot;Lyondoners&quot; are based in London and follow Lyon at home, away and internationally.

==Statistics and records==
Lyon&#x27;s first competitive game was a 3–0 victory against CA Paris-Charenton on 26 August 1950. Since the club&#x27;s foundation in 1950, they have played over 50 seasons in France&#x27;s highest football division, playing over 1,800 matches. Of the nine seasons the club played in Ligue 2, they contested 310 matches. Lyon achieved their 1,000th victory during the 2003–04 season after defeating Strasbourg.

The Moroccan-born French midfielder Serge Chiesa holds Lyon overall appearance record having played in 541 matches over the course of 14 seasons from 1969 to 1983. Following him is former goalkeeper Grégory Coupet who contested 518 matches over the course of 11 seasons from 1997 to 2008. Along with Sidney Govou, Coupet also has the distinction of being the only player in Lyon&#x27;s history to win all four domestic French titles having been a part of all seven Ligue 1 titles, the club&#x27;s Coupe de France triumph in 2008, the only Coupe de la Ligue win in 2001, and six of the seven Trophée des Champions titles. Govou, Coupet, and Juninho share the honour of being only Lyon players who were a part of all seven title runs.

The club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer is Fleury Di Nallo, who scored 222 goals while at the club from 1960 to 1974. Di Nallo is also third behind Chiesa and Coupet in all time appearances having played in 489 matches during his 14-year stint at the club. Despite Di Nallo&#x27;s impressive goalscoring record, he doesn&#x27;t hold the record for most goals scored during a league season. That distinction was held by Bourg-en-Bresse-born André Guy who notched 25 goals, which he attained in the 1968–69 season. Alexandre Lacazette, however, scored his 26th goal of the 2014–15 league season in an important game away to Stade de Reims when he scored in the sixth minute.

Lyon&#x27;s biggest victory is 10–0, which occurred of two occasions against Ajaccio during the 1953–54 edition of the Coupe de France and, two seasons later, against Delle during the 1955–56 edition of the competition. Lyon&#x27;s biggest league victory is 8–0 and also occurred on two occasions. The first being during the 1966–67 season against Angers, and the second being against Marseille during the 1997–98 season. The club&#x27;s biggest victory on the European stage occurred during the 1974–75 season, where Lyon hammered Luxembourg-based club FA Red Boys Differdange 7–0.

==Rivalries==

Historically, Lyon has had a healthy rivalry with Saint-Étienne, head-to-head clashes between the clubs being referred to as the &quot;Derby Rhône-Alpes&quot;. Since the club&#x27;s dominance at the start of the new millennium, however, they have established rivalries with Marseille, Bordeaux, Paris Saint-Germain and Lille. Lyon also share minor rivalries with fellow Rhône-Alpes clubs Grenoble and AS Lyon Duchère.

The Saint-Étienne rivalry began during the 1960s when Lyon established their residency in the French first division. The Arpitan rivalry stems simply from the close proximity of the clubs to each other, separated by just , as well as historical social and cultural difference between the two cities where they are based; Lyon traditionally cited as being a financially comfortable and middle class city, while Saint-Étienne is traditionally regarded as being more industrial and working-class. The derby also pits &quot;the most recently successful French club&quot; (Lyon) against &quot;the formerly biggest French club&quot; (Saint-Étienne) and is often seen as one of the high points of the Ligue 1 season.

Lyon&#x27;s rivalry with Marseille goes back to 23 September 1945, when the clubs contested their first match. The derby, often called &quot;Choc des Olympiques&quot; (&quot;Clash of the Olympics&quot;) or &quot;Olympico&quot;, is often cited as being particularly important as both clubs are of high standard in French football and the championship is regularly decided between the two. Marseille, Saint-Étienne, Lyon, and PSG are the only French clubs to have won the French first division four straight times, with Marseille doing this on two occasions.

==Sponsors==
On 7 August 2009, Lyon announced that it signed a ten-year deal with the German sportswear brand Adidas, effective at the start of the 2010–11 season with Lyon earning €5 million annually from the deal, plus possible royalty fees based on product sales. As of the 2024–25 season, Lyon still have a deal with Adidas which will last until the end of the 2028–29 season.

Following the 2008–09 season, Lyon&#x27;s long-term sponsorship agreement with the French multinational corporation Accor and Lyon-based Renault Trucks ended. On 22 July 2009, the Paris-based online bookmaker BetClic reached an agreement with Lyon to advertise on the club&#x27;s kits. However, due to French law prohibiting online gambling, Lyon could not wear its kits displaying the logo. On 12 August 2009, just before the opening league match against Le Mans, the club was relieved of its BetClic-sponsored shirts by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which warned the club that it risked forfeiting points if the club wore them. Lyon complied and, since the Le Mans match, wore sponsorless shirts while playing on French soil. Lyon were free to wear its BetClic sponsored shirts outside France; on 25 August 2009, the club unveiled the shirts in Belgium while taking on Anderlecht in the Champions League. On 15 January 2010, Lyon secured a sponsorship agreement with Japanese video game company Sony Computer Entertainment to display the company&#x27;s PlayStation logo on their shirts. The deal lasted until the end of the 2009–10 season. In 2010, the French ban on online gambling advertising was lifted and Lyon began wearing its BetClic-sponsored shirts on French soil. In August 2012, the club agreed a two-year sponsorship deal with Korean car manufacturers Hyundai that would start in 2012–13 season, replacing BetClic as the main sponsor in their shirts for Ligue 1 matches.

Lyon have been sponsored by Emirates since 2020.

==Media==
On 27 July 2005, the club launched the 24/7 network OLTV, which is completely devoted to club programming and events, along with reserve and women&#x27;s team matches. OLTV was renamed to OL Play in 2021.

==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==
* In seasons where there are multiple shirt sponsors, a different sponsor would appear for corresponding kits, e.g. home, away, and alternate kits.

<text>Caldon Canal is a branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal which opened in 1779. It runs from Etruria, Stoke-on-Trent, to Froghall, Staffordshire. The canal has 17 locks and the Froghall Tunnel.

==History==
The first plans by the proprietors of the Trent and Mersey Canal Company to construct a canal from the summit level to Leek were considered in January 1773. This would have been a tub-boat canal, as the boats were designed to carry just 5 tons, and rather than using locks, inclined planes were to be used at points where the level of the canal needed to change. Two more plans were considered, and the third included extra reservoirs which would supply the summit level of the existing main line. At a similar time, an independent company was planning a link to Leek, but the Trent &amp; Mersey managed to block this. Having secured contracts with several owners of limestone quarries in the Cauldon Low area, the company sought an act of Parliament to authorise construction of the new works, which it obtained as the (16 Geo. 3. c. 32) in May 1776.
The act enabled the proprietors to borrow £25,000 to fund the construction, which was completed in December 1778. Initially, there were 16 locks, eight rising from Etruria to the start of the summit at Stockton, and eight falling from the end of the summit to Froghall. of the canal followed the bed of the river Churnet near Consall. The company could also build railways to the quarries, and the first, which ran from Froghall across Shirley Common towards the quarries opened at the same time as the canal, but was not a success. A second act of Parliament, the Trent and Mersey Canal Act 1783 (23 Geo. 3. c. 33), was obtained to authorise a new tramway, and to extend the canal by , which included the Froghall tunnel. The tramway was long, and was funded out of revenue, as the act did not authorise the raising of additional capital.
Traffic on the Trent and Mersey main line was such that it suffered from water shortage in dry periods, and water levels on the Caldon branch were often too low at such times, as the water was used to keep the main line moving. In 1796, the company wanted to build a reservoir at Rudyard, to improve the situation, and a branch to Leek was included in the bill, as it was the only way to obtain the consent of the Leek authorities and landowners for the reservoir. The bill was defeated in Parliament, after which the Peak Forest Canal Company proposed to build a branch of their canal from Marple to Leek, and on to join the Caldon branch. It would also have included a reservoir at Rudyard, but the plan was short-lived, as the Trent and Mersey succeeded in getting their bill passed when they submitted it to Parliament for a second time in 1797, when the (37 Geo. 3. c. 36) was passed.

To ensure that the water from Rudyard could be used to supply the main line, the Leek branch had to join the top level of the Caldon branch, and so the original route with the three Park Lane locks was closed and a new route built, with a three-lock staircase between the junction and the old line of the canal. This was altered again in 1841 to the present arrangement, where the canal to Froghall passes under an aqueduct on the Leek branch, and three separate locks at Hollinhurst raise the old line up to the summit level.

With the coming of the railways, the Trent and Mersey Company canals were sold to the North Staffordshire Railway, with the formal takeover occurring on 15 January 1845. They were keen to promote the canals and railways as mutual feeders, and so maintained the canals, with the exception of the Uttoxeter branch, which was closed by an act of Parliament obtained in July 1847, so that the Churnet Valley Railway could be built along its course. The tramway from Froghall to Cauldon Quarries was replaced by a new cable-operated railway in 1849. It included inclined planes at Froghall, Oldridge and Cotton, and was built to a gauge of . Trains consisted of up to nine waggons, each capable of holding 6 tons of limestone, and around 1,000 tons a day were moved from the quarries to the canal.

Traffic gradually moved away from the canal to the railways. In 1904, Endon basin was built, where limestone brought from the quarries by the railway could be transferred to boats. One of the major users of the limestone, based at Sandbach, closed in 1920, and the cable railway to Froghall closed in the same year. Limestone was no longer transhipped at Endon from 1930, and the canal saw virtually no traffic. Responsibility for the canal passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1940, who closed the Leek branch under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (Canals) Act 1944 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. ii). The last heavy commercial traffic was the transfer of coal from Endon to Cheddleton, which ceased in 1952.

Johnson Brothers built three new, specialized barges, &quot;Milton Maid&quot;, built in 1967, &quot;Milton Queen&quot; in 1973, and &quot;Milton Princess&quot; in 1978, to convey pottery over a stretch of the canal from its factory in Milton to a new packaging plant near the Ivy House lift bridge in Hanley. The experiment was a success: transport by water reduced costs by 50 per cent and diminished the number of breakages of wares. Operation continued until 1990, becoming one of the last commercial narrowboat runs.

===Operation===
Because the Caldon Canal was promoted and built by the proprietors of the Trent and Mersey Canal Company, as such it is more properly called the Caldon Branch of that canal. It was built to carry limestone from Caldon Low Quarries which was transported to Froghall wharf via three inclined tramways. Other important traffic for the canal was coal from the Cheadle Coalfield and ironstone from the several iron ore mines in the Churnet valley and Kingsley area. The canal was subject to considerable mining subsidence in the Etruria area, which eventually led to the need for an entirely new lock, Planet Lock, with a rise of just , to adjust the levels. Water to the canal is supplied by three reservoirs and the River Churnet. Stanley reservoir holds 22 million cubic feet (670 Megalitres (Ml)), and joins the canal just below Endon basin, while Knypersley holds 41 million cubic feet (1,200 Ml) and joins the canal above Engine Lock. The final section of its feeder was originally the Norton Green branch, a private canal built at the same time as the main line, to service a colliery. Rudyard reservoir holds 122 million cubic feet (3,500 Ml), and its feeder, which joins the Leek branch near the Churnet aqueduct, follows much of the proposed route of the Macclesfield Canal extension to Leek. Since the Caldon joins the summit level of the Trent and Mersey system, it is still a valuable supply for that canal too.

===Restoration===
Although the canal was never legally closed, its traffic had declined to such an extent that by the 1960s it was almost unusable. A survey of it was carried out in 1960 by the Inland Waterway Protection Society, which had been formed in 1958 in response to the Bowes Committee report, which listed many canals which it thought should no longer be maintained. In April 1959, the government created the Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee, whose responsibility was to assist schemes to redevelop canals that were no longer commercially viable, and the survey formed the basis of a submission to that committee. With further threats of closure in 1961, the Stoke-on-Trent boat club organised a public meeting in Hanley and a cruise along the canal to Froghall in September. This attracted press coverage and local council support. There was then a proposal by the Caldon Canal Committee for the National Trust to take over the waterway, and although this did not occur, the committee became the Caldon Canal Society, and worked with the British Waterways Board towards its eventual restoration.

Staffordshire County Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council announced that they would make contributions towards the restoration in 1969. The Inland Waterways Association held a boat rally at Endon in May 1971, to publicise the need to restore the canal, and in February 1972 the government introduced a scheme to help local authorities to fund work on local facilities that were visually unattractive. Called &quot;Operation Eyesore&quot;, it offered grants of up to 85 per cent for the work. Everything was now in place for the restoration, which was officially announced on 22 August 1972.

Restoration of the main line to Froghall was completed in 1974, but the Caldon Canal Society continued to press for more to be done. Agreement was reached on how to finance restoration of the Leek branch in mid-1977, and volunteer work parties began the task of clearing the route so that it could be dredged. The main line from Etruria to Froghall and the Leek Branch were two of seven stretches of canal, formally designated as remainder waterways, which were re-classified by the British Waterways Act 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132 km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway standard.

In 2003, many years of restoration work came to a close as Froghall Wharf, the southern terminus, was reopened to vessels. The work included a new wharf, refurbished toilet facilities and a new visitor centre. A disused lock, actually the first lock on the Uttoxeter Branch (see below), was reopened, as was the basin below it, and moorings for several boats were created. Much of the work was undertaken with volunteer aid, and funded in part by contributions from the European Regional Development Fund.

===Froghall tunnel===

Because the roof of the Froghall tunnel has always been extremely low, the 2003 restoration included lowering the water level in the pound after dredging, and thus the headroom in the tunnel was improved to with a beam of . Unfortunately the new moorings just past the tunnel remain relatively little used, as many modern boats are still too high to pass through the tunnel. A height profile gauge is located at the exit of Flintmill Lock 17 to indicate whether a boat has sufficient clearance to pass through the tunnel. The low height restriction would similarly affect proposals to reopen stretches of the Uttoxeter Canal to boating.

==Description==

The canal begins at Etruria, next to the top lock of the Stoke flight on the Trent &amp; Mersey canal. A statue of James Brindley, the engineer for the Trent &amp; Mersey main line, stands near the junction. Following the course of the infant River Trent, the waterway climbs to a summit level at Stockton Brook, which carries it over the watershed between the Trent and Churnet Valleys. Thereafter the canal descends through locks at Hazelhurst and then Cheddleton, into an initially broad flood plain.

At about a mile above Consall Forge, at Oak Meadow Ford Lock, the canal locks down into the River Churnet for about a mile; the reason for this is that the valley at this point is too narrow to accommodate both canal and river. High river levels can prevent vessels from using this section. At Consall Forge, river and canal part company again, and the canal, which is now only wide enough for a single boat, continues its rural journey to Froghall. The final section, built after the main construction was finished, includes the Froghall Tunnel, which has limited headroom, immediately followed by Froghall Basin.

==Branches==
===Leek===
The canal has one branch, the Leek Branch, which runs for and includes the Leek Tunnel. The Leek Branch, opened in 1800/01, meets the main line at Hazelhurst Junction, after crossing the main line on Hazelhurst Aqueduct . Currently the branch ends some way from Leek town centre. The original length of the canal, extending to a basin on the south side of Leek Railway Station, was filled in during the late 1950s/early 1960s to allow for the building of the Barnfields Road Industrial Estate. (When it appeared that Harecastle tunnel, on the Trent and Mersey Canal, might have to close permanently because of mining subsidence, a bypassing connection between the Leek Branch and the Macclesfield Canal at Bosley was mooted; fortunately Harecastle tunnel remains open to navigation.)

A survey has been commissioned to investigate the possibility of extending the branch back into Leek.
In November 2009 a breach occurred just beyond the northern portal of Leek Tunnel. This resulted in the end section being closed for eight months while repairs were carried out. The cause of the problem was thought to be an old culvert. While the canal was drained, several other sections of embankment were re-inforced, and the repaired canal was reopened on 5 July 2010.

===Uttoxeter Canal===
Originally, the canal also had a further branch, which opened in 1811. Sometimes referred to as the Uttoxeter Canal, it ran from Froghall as far south as Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and had 17 locks.
The canal was never a commercial success and in 1849 much of it was filled in by the North Staffordshire Railway Company and converted into the NSR Churnet Valley line from Leekbrook to Uttoxeter (which itself was finally closed for goods traffic in 1988). This line is still open as far south as Froghall, as a preserved railway, the Churnet Valley Railway.

Further south, at Denstone, several buildings including a church have been built on the line of the canal. Incidentally this branch line had the first automatic, train-operated level-crossing in the UK, at Spath, just outside Uttoxeter. A few bridges from the Uttoxeter branch remain, with the occasional &#x27;milepost&#x27;, and Uttoxeter still has an area called &quot;The Wharf&quot;. The Caldon &amp; Uttoxeter Canals Trust has put forward plans to re-open the Uttoxeter Branch. Part of the old canal bed has been lost underneath JCB&#x27;s head office and factory at Rocester, so the proposed route diverges from the original canal.

===Foxley===
Another much shorter (approximately ) branch of the Caldon main line, the Foxley, ran from Milton in the north east of Stoke-on-Trent through Sneyd Green to Ford Green Iron Works near Smallthorne, where it ended in two parallel basins of each. What little remains of the Foxley can be found in the Holden Lane Pools nature reserve, as well as alongside the footpath from the reserve to the Elizabethan Ford Green Hall. The position of the former junction is marked, on a sharp bend in the canal, at a pub called The Foxley in Milton.

<doc id="979523" wikidata="Q4986489" url="?curid=979523" title="Building Nothing Out of Something">
<text>Building Nothing Out of Something is a compilation album released in January 2000 by American indie rock band Modest Mouse, comprising non-album tracks from various points in the band&#x27;s career. All songs were originally released from 1996 to 1998. In 2015, Brock&#x27;s Glacial Pace re-released the album for CD and Vinyl (with some unmarked random copies containing red vinyl rather than black).

==Production==

The songs on this album were recorded between 1995 and 1998, composing of A and B sides from singles, three tracks from Interstate 8, and one song from the vinyl version of The Lonesome Crowded West. 

The track &quot;Sleepwalking (Couples Only Dance Prom Night) contains a melody from Sleep Walk, a 1959 instrumental song by American Rock &amp; Roll duo Santo and Johnny. The song contains lyrics, written by Isaac Brock.

==Reception==

In a review for Pitchfork, Brent Dicrescenzo gives the album an 8.9 out of 10. In the review, he says &quot;Though Building Nothing Out of Something merely compiles old singles and rarities, it might be the best Modest Mouse release for newcomers&#x27; initiation, as well as instant gratification for long time fans. This batch of songs is easily their most varied. &quot;Never Ending Math Equation&quot; tick-tocks to a screeching turntable crescendo. &quot;Medication&quot; floats a slow, crystalline guitar line over muted field recordings of traffic, foghorns, and railroad bells before trotting into an acoustic coda with blithe organs. The most beautiful near-seven minutes of Modest Mouse&#x27;s career rumbles throughout &quot;Workin&#x27; on Leavin&#x27; the Livin&#x27;&quot;-- a psychedelic testimonial to the afterlife. &quot;Sleepwalkin&#x27;&quot; mines the 1950s ballad of the same name, but sets the affair in an underwater chamber of whale-call guitars and aching melodies. And a suitable meltdown climaxes in the closer, &quot;Other People&#x27;s Lives,&quot; when Brock treats his guitar like solder.

<doc id="979528" wikidata="Q17104825" url="?curid=979528" title="Nuisance parameter">
<text>In statistics, a nuisance parameter is any parameter which is unspecified but which must be accounted for in the hypothesis testing of the parameters which are of interest. 

The classic example of a nuisance parameter comes from the normal distribution, a member of the location–scale family. For at least one normal distribution, the variance(s), &quot;σ2&quot; is often not specified or known, but one desires to hypothesis test on the mean(s). Another example might be linear regression with unknown variance in the explanatory variable (the independent variable): its variance is a nuisance parameter that must be accounted for to derive an accurate interval estimate of the regression slope, calculate p-values, hypothesis test on the slope&#x27;s value; see regression dilution.

Nuisance parameters are often scale parameters, but not always; for example in errors-in-variables models, the unknown true location of each observation is a nuisance parameter. A parameter may also cease to be a &quot;nuisance&quot; if it becomes the object of study, is estimated from data, or known.

==Theoretical statistics==
The general treatment of nuisance parameters can be broadly similar between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to theoretical statistics. It relies on an attempt to partition the likelihood function into components representing information about the parameters of interest and information about the other (nuisance) parameters. This can involve ideas about sufficient statistics and ancillary statistics. When this partition can be achieved it may be possible to complete a Bayesian analysis for the parameters of interest by determining their joint posterior distribution algebraically. The partition allows frequentist theory to develop general estimation approaches in the presence of nuisance parameters. If the partition cannot be achieved it may still be possible to make use of an approximate partition.

In some special cases, it is possible to formulate methods that circumvent the presences of nuisance parameters. The t-test provides a practically useful test because the test statistic does not depend on the unknown variance but only the sample variance. It is a case where use can be made of a pivotal quantity. However, in other cases no such circumvention is known.

==Practical statistics==
Practical approaches to statistical analysis treat nuisance parameters somewhat differently in frequentist and Bayesian methodologies.

A general approach in a frequentist analysis can be based on maximum likelihood-ratio tests. These provide both significance tests and confidence intervals for the parameters of interest which are approximately valid for moderate to large sample sizes and which take account of the presence of nuisance parameters. See Basu (1977) for some general discussion and Spall and Garner (1990) for some discussion relative to the identification of parameters in linear dynamic (i.e., state space representation) models.

In Bayesian analysis, a generally applicable approach creates random samples from the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters: see Markov chain Monte Carlo. Given these, the joint distribution of only the parameters of interest can be readily found by marginalizing over the nuisance parameters. However, this approach may not always be computationally efficient if some or all of the nuisance parameters can be eliminated on a theoretical basis.

<doc id="979531" wikidata="Q1172092" url="?curid=979531" title="Survival of the Sickest (album)">
<text>Survival of the Sickest is the fourth studio album by American rock band Saliva. It was released on August 17, 2004. &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot; is the only song which features rap vocals in the bridge and it also has the same exact lyrics in &quot;No Regrets&quot; just using a different musical approach to both songs. The album produced two singles: &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot; in June 2004, and &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; in November 2004. The title track was featured in the video games &quot;NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup&quot; and &quot;Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;, and was the official theme song for WWE&#x27;s Unforgiven 2004 pay per view. It is their final album to feature original rhythm guitarist Chris D&#x27;Abaldo, who would leave the band in 2005.
==Background and development==
In an interview with MTV, lead singer Josey Scott explained how he and the band changed their approach to crafting the album by cooling down on the girls and partying so that they&#x27;re &quot;well rested and well prepared&quot; to record material that Scott made on his free time: &quot;On our last tour, I personally got in the back of the tour bus with a little Wal-Mart tape recorder and just started beating these songs out. So when we went into the studio this time, I was prepared. I had 25 songs ready to go.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Sean Richardson found the album going back to the band&#x27;s early hard rock sound from their 1997 self-titled debut, praising Josey Scott for crafting tracks that pay tribute to 80s hair metal and penning both &quot;aching redemption songs and seething revenge tirades&quot; that make it more contemporary. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic was mixed about the material throughout the record, criticizing the band&#x27;s foray into &quot;glowering, melodramatic plods (&quot;No Regrets, Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Eyes Open&quot;)&quot; and slumming with &quot;massively compressed, hard-head rockers (&quot;Carry On&quot;, &quot;Fuck All Y&#x27;All&quot;)&quot; but highlighted the title track, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Revolution&quot; and &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; for containing quality hard rock credentials with a Southern style, concluding with &quot;That said, it&#x27;s too bad the rest of &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot; panders to unimaginative industry and genre posturing.&quot; Chuck Klosterman, writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, criticized Scott&#x27;s musical craftsmanship on the album for giving the band a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; when delivering his skewed vision of rock music, concluding that &quot;Still, there&#x27;s some Godsmackian guitar work on &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot;, and the production has a Montana-esque vastness that will undoubtedly sound good on terrible radio stations across the U.S.&quot;

<doc id="979536" wikidata="Q492231" url="?curid=979536" title="Naracoorte, South Australia">
<text>Naracoorte is a town in the Limestone Coast region of South Australia, approximately 336 kilometres south-east of Adelaide and 100 kilometres north of Mount Gambier on the Riddoch Highway (A66).

==History==
Before the colonisation of South Australia in 1836, the land now occupied by the town of Naracoorte was situated on the border of lands occupied by the Bindjali people to the east and Ngarrindjeri to the east. 

Naracoorte was formed from the merger of two towns, Kincraig, founded in 1845 by Scottish explorer William Macintosh, and Narracoorte, established as a government settlement in 1847. The name has gone through a number of spellings, and is believed to be derived from the Aboriginal words for &quot;place of running water&quot; or &quot;large waterhole&quot;. It grew during the 1850s as a service town for people going to and from the Victorian gold rush. The post office opened in March 1853 and was known as Mosquito Plains post office until 1861.

The District Council of Naracoorte was established in August 1870 to locally govern the lands of the Hundred of Naracoorte. In 1888 the size of the district was dramatically expanded to include surrounding areas not yet locally governed. As a consequence, in February 1924 the Corporate Town of Naracoorte was established to provide dedicated local governance to the township.

In 1935 a cinema, the Austral Theatre, designed by Chris A. Smith, opened at 124-140 Smith Street. It was later known as the Rivoli Theatre.

The Kingston-Naracoorte railway line was closed on 28 November 1987 and dismantled in September 1991. On 12 April 1995, the Mount Gambier to Wolseley line was closed, while pending gauge standardisation.

== Governance ==
Since 1993 Naracoorte has been locally governed by the amalgamated Naracoorte Lucindale Council. Naracoorte is in the state electoral district of MacKillop, and the federal Division of Barker.

== Economy ==

Naracoorte has historically been a service centre for the sheep, cattle and wheat farming industries in the surrounding area.

In recent decades, tourism has become a major industry due to the town&#x27;s proximity to several wine regions and internationally recognised natural features. Both the World-Heritage-listed Naracoorte Caves National Park, the Ramsar-listed Bool and Hacks Lagoons are south of the township. The wine regions of Coonawarra and Wrattonbully lie further south, while the Padthaway lies to the north, placing Naracoorte at the centre of the three.
Other places of interest to tourists include:
*The Visitor Information Centre &amp; Sheep&#x27;s Back Museum – MacDonnell Street
*Lions Pioneer Park – MacDonnell Street
*Tiny Train Park &amp; Mini Golf – Park Terrace
*Naracoorte Art Gallery – Ormerod Street
*Mini Jumbuk Centre – 61 Smith Street
*Swimming Lake – Moore Street
*Jubilee Nature Park – Moore Street
*Russet Ridge Winery – Cnr Caves Road and Riddoch Highway
*Struan House – Riddoch Highway

===Heritage listed sites===
Naracoorte has a number of sites listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, including:

* 6 Church Street: St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church
* DeGaris Place: Commercial Bank of South Australia Building (current council office)
* 2 Laurie Crescent: St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church
* MacDonnell Street: Simpson&#x27;s Flour Mill (current Sheep&#x27;s Back Museum)
* 23–25 McDonnell Street: Limbert&#x27;s Store and Residence
* 30 McLeay Street: Dartmoor Homestead
* 13 Ormerod Street: Old Naracoorte District Council Chambers
* 81 Smith Street: National Bank Building

==Services==

===Schools===
There are three schools: Naracoorte High on Stewart Terrace, Naracoorte Primary on Park Terrace and Naracoorte South Primary. Independent schools include Naracoorte Christian School, also called Sunrise Christian School, on Caves Road.

===Other services===
*Naracoorte Hospital
*Police at 66 Smith Street
*Transport – Bus station at 170 Smith Street

==Climate==
Naracoorte has a dry temperate mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Csbk&quot;). It has warm, dry summers that are frequently interrupted by cold fronts. Naracoorte has cool, very rainy winters.

== Media ==
=== Newspapers ===
The town is home to &quot;The Naracoorte Herald&quot;, a newspaper published in the town under that name since 1948. Prior to that, the newspaper had used the older spelling of the town, and was known as The Narracoorte Herald, which had begun publication on 14 December 1875. It was formerly part of Fairfax Media, with the Fairfax regional office located in the town on Smith Street. Since mid 2019 it has been owned by Australian Community Media, who purchased the Rural Press publications when Fairfax was bought by Nine.

In 1912, a nearby publication, the Tatiara and Lawloit News (13 June 1908 – 15 June 1912), which also printed in Naracoorte, was absorbed into the &quot;Herald&quot;.

In May 2020 a new rival paper, &quot;Naracoorte Community News&quot; was launched by Michael Waite to fill the gap left by the suspension of ‘&#x27;The Naracoorte Herald&#x27;’ during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>William Lowe Waller Sr. (October 21, 1926 – November 30, 2011) was an American politician and attorney. A Democrat, Waller served as the 56th governor of Mississippi from 1972 to 1976. Born near Oxford, Mississippi to a farming family, Waller went to law school and in 1950 established a law practice in Jackson. Nine years later, he was elected District Attorney of Hinds County, Mississippi. Waller attempted to reform the position and provoked the ire of local law enforcement for aggressively prosecuting several cases. In 1964, he twice prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith for the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers, with both trials resulting in deadlocked juries. In 1967, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for governor, finishing fifth in the Democratic primary.

Waller ran for governor again in 1971, denouncing state establishment leaders and winning in the primary and in the general election. Taking office in January 1972, he associated himself with the New South governors, his moderate contemporaries in other Southern states. Though unsuccessful in reconciling racial differences within the Mississippi Democratic Party, he brought blacks into state government and successfully shut down the State Sovereignty Commission. His tenure was also marked by his significant disagreement with the Mississippi State Legislature. After leaving gubernatorial office in 1976, Waller returned to practicing law in Jackson. He ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1978 and for governor again in 1987, losing both races. He released his memoirs in 2007 and died four years later.

== Early life ==
Waller was born on October 21, 1926, near Oxford in Lafayette County, Mississippi, to Percy A. Waller and Myrtle Gatewood. He and his two siblings worked on their parents&#x27; farm in their youth. The family was not affluent, but fared better than many of their neighbors during the Great Depression. Waller&#x27;s father was involved in local politics and a friend of politician Ross Barnett, who later became governor of the state. He attended public schools in the Black Jack community of Panola County before graduating from University High School in Oxford in 1944. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Memphis State University and a bachelor of laws from the University of Mississippi School of Law.

In 1950, Waller established a legal practice in Jackson, Mississippi. He served in the United States Army as an intelligence officer during the Korean War, attaining the rank of sergeant. He was offered a commission in the intelligence corps, but he declined, being discharged on November 30, 1953. He returned to Jackson to active Army Reserve duty and resumed his legal career. He married Carroll Waller on November 11, 1950 and had four sons and a daughter with her. One of his sons, Bill Waller Jr., later served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Mississippi and made an unsuccessful bid for gubernatorial office in 2019.

== Early political career ==
Waller was elected District Attorney of the Seventh Judicial District of Mississippi (Hinds County) in 1959 and was reelected in 1963. He was sworn in on January 2, 1960. At the time he took office, the district attorney in Hinds County was a part-time job with little expected of its incumbent. Many previous attorneys had used the office to promote their own private legal services. Waller attempted to reform the position, and provoked the ire of local law enforcement for aggressively prosecuting several cases, including a white man who had murdered a black man and a wealthy woman who had murdered her husband. Despite this, his legal practice expanded during his tenure with several new partners. He also befriended Mississippi political columnist Bill Minor.

As the district attorney, Waller prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith in the murder of civil rights advocate Medgar Evers in two trials in 1964, both of which resulted in mistrials due to deadlocked juries. Waller did not approve of Evers&#x27; activism and did not view the trials as a means to denounce Jim Crow racial segregation, but saw it as an opportunity to demonstrate that laws would be upheld in the state. Most observers agreed Waller ably presented his case against Beckwith, establishing his rifle as the murder weapon and using witnesses to establish his presence in the vicinity of the killing on the night it had occurred. Though worried that it might backfire among the white jury members, Waller also attempted to establish a motive for the murder by getting Beckwith to testify to his support for white supremacy and staunch opposition to racial integration. Fears among white Mississippians that Waller was a &quot;liberal&quot; for trying De Le Beckwith led his firm to lose clients. Numerous observers speculated that the trials would damage his political prospects, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing in February 1964 that &quot;He may have put his career on the block by his tireless prosecution of the case&quot;. Despite this, he won some national acclaim for convincing several white jurors to vote for conviction and ingratiated himself to Mississippi&#x27;s black population. Beckwith was later convicted after a third trial in 1994.

By the mid-1960s, Waller was disenchanted with Mississippi&#x27;s political leaders&#x27; hardline efforts to resist desegregation. In 1967, he ran for the office of governor in the Democratic primary. Not backed by a significant campaign organization, he was low on resources and confined to active campaigning on the weekends. The contest was dominated by issues of race. Waller attempted to straddle both sides of the issue, becoming the first Mississippian gubernatorial candidate to ever publicly condemn the Ku Klux Klan while also criticizing civil rights activists and praising the work of Citizens&#x27; Councils. Largely ignored by the public in favor of other segregationist candidates, he placed fifth in the primary, earning 60,090 votes, only nine percent of the vote.

== Gubernatorial career ==
=== 1971 campaign and election ===
In 1971, Waller mounted another campaign for gubernatorial office, facing Lieutenant Governor Charles L. Sullivan, Jimmy Swan, and four others in the Democratic primary. While Swan resorted to racist appeals and declared his opposition to integration, Waller and Sullivan focused on other matters, though they both affirmed their support for &quot;law and order&quot; and segregation academies, and opposed desegregation busing. They also pledged to appoint blacks to state offices. Waller stated that he was running against the &quot;Capitol Street Gang&quot;, establishment industry leaders and lawyers in Jackson he said had acted as a political machine and captured control of state government, preventing Mississippi from economically developing. He declared his support for raising teacher salaries and investing more funds in state highways. He hired Deloss Walker of Memphis, Tennessee, as a campaign consultant, beginning a trend of gubernatorial candidates using out-of-state advertising agencies which lasted into the 1980s.

The primary went into a runoff between Waller and Sullivan, Waller garnered the endorsements of U.S. Senator James Eastland and former governor Barnett, and relied on a network of Eastland supporters to organize grassroots backing for himself. He attacked Sullivan as an &quot;establishment&quot; figure and won the runoff with 54 percent of the vote, taking 389,952 votes to Sullivan&#x27;s 329,236. In the general election Waller faced two independents, civil rights activist Charles Evers (the brother of Medgar) and segregationist judge Tom P. Brady. Evers was the other major candidate and, despite the fears of public observers, the campaign was largely devoid of racism and both him and Waller avoided negative tactics. Waller won with 601,222 votes to Evers&#x27; 172,762 and Brady&#x27;s 6,653. He was inaugurated as Governor of Mississippi on January 18, 1972.

=== Executive action and appointments ===

As governor, Waller began hosting weekly press conferences. He was &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and responsible for appointing several other of its members. The sovereignty commission was responsible for upholding segregation in the state, though by the time Waller took office it had little business to conduct. He delayed in naming his appointees to the body and sent a representative to its meetings in lieu of his attendance. In 1973 he vetoed the commission&#x27;s funding bill, leading it to shut down in June before being formally abolished in 1977. Despite some criticism in the press over costs, he directed the purchase of the state&#x27;s first jet to serve as official transportation for state officials. He undertook several trips to Europe, Asia, and South America to secure business deals for the state.

Waller appointed several blacks to positions in state government and his staff, the first time this had been done since the Reconstruction era, but most had no history of political activity. His first black appointee was Jim Rundles as a special assistant. Rundles was known as a mild-mannered man who had refused to take part in civil rights demonstrations. He also appointed the first black woman to a state board in Mississippi&#x27;s history and integrated the Mississippi Highway Patrol. On the whole, his administration was overwhelmingly staffed by whites. He created a Minority Advisory Committee and an Office of Minority Business Enterprise. In August 1972, he became the first Mississippi governor to visit the territory of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians when he spoke at the opening of the Choctaw Indian Fair.

At the onset of his term, Waller and his family decided not to move into the Mississippi Governor&#x27;s Mansion, which had fallen into disrepair. Waller&#x27;s wife led a campaign to restore the house, and the family eventually occupied it in May 1975. Unlike his predecessors and successors, Waller refused to use convicts as servants in the mansion. In 1972, he authorized the work release of one of the men convicted of murdering civil rights activist Vernon Dahmer. Waller had served as legal counsel for the convicted murderer prior to his election, and his action drew scrutiny from blacks. The following week, he declared that Medgar Evers Day would be celebrated on the tenth anniversary of the civil rights leader&#x27;s death, but then did not attended the formal ceremony marking the date. Some observers saw this declaration as an attempt to deflect from the release authorization.

=== Legislative action ===
By the time Waller took office, the position of governor in Mississippi had long been subordinated in policy matters to the legislature. Waller announced large annual legislative proposals, but made little effort to build relationships with legislative leaders, including Lieutenant Governor William F. Winter and Speaker of the House of Representatives John R. Junkin. Waller rarely informed Winter when he was leaving the state, meaning the latter often discovered that he was to be acting governor from newspaper stories. Waller disregard Junkin&#x27;s advice to leave most matters of public importance to the legislature, and came into frequent conflict with the body, vetoing 32 bills during his tenure. His relationship with legislators was poor on an individual level, and he would seek support for his ideas from the public rather than them. The legislature overrode some of his vetoes, the first time it had done so to a governor in 44 years.

Waller proposed several reform measures which were opposed by older and more rural legislators. He supported efforts to create public kindergartens and reenact a compulsory education law, but these measures all died in the Senate. He appointed a blue ribbon committee to make recommendations on higher education, but the board of trustees of the University of Mississippi refused to cooperate with it or accept its criticisms of the university system. He supported the legislature&#x27;s creation of new schools at Mississippi State University. In February 1974, he vetoed a special appropriation bill for university libraries, arguing that the university system did not require additional capital outlays. He also backed an unsuccessful bill to set limits on campaign spending. The legislature ignored his proposals to redraft the state constitution and permit gubernatorial succession.

Waller endorsed the funding of a $600 million highway program, but the proposal had been devised during his predecessor&#x27;s tenure and declining government revenues led it to be later suspended. He initially backed a reform of the state&#x27;s tax structure and the raising of the oil and gas severance tax, but later backed away from these efforts due to opposition from legislators and lobbyists. He successfully secured funding for a new Mississippi Highway Patrol headquarters and enhancements to the state crime laboratory. He also convinced the legislature to remove tax collection responsibilities from the duties of county sheriffs.

=== Political affairs ===

Waller associated himself with the New South governors, his moderate contemporaries in other Southern states, and distanced himself from Alabama&#x27;s staunchly segregationist governor, George Wallace. At the time he took office, the Mississippi Democratic Party was split into two factions: the Regulars, composed of white segregationists, and the Loyalists, composed of black members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and moderate whites. In anticipation of the 1972 Democratic National Convention, Waller encouraged the Regular and Loyalist factions to re-unify, fearing that the convention would exclude the Regulars otherwise.

Waller initially rejected a meeting with Loyalist leader Aaron Henry to reach a compromise, but later offered to give the Loyalists 40% representation in a mixed convention delegation. The offer was rebuffed and the convention ultimately seated the Loyalist faction&#x27;s own delegation. Negotiations between the two groups continued throughout Waller&#x27;s tenure. As part of this, Waller signed a law which permitted the Loyalist faction to choose between electing delegates in presidential primaries or nominating them at district conventions. He supported former mayor and district attorney Maurice Dantin in the 1975 Mississippi gubernatorial election. He was succeeded by Cliff Finch on January 20, 1976.

== Later political career ==
After leaving gubernatorial office, Waller returned to practicing law in Jackson. Most of his clients were working-class people, and he handled many divorce and personal injury suits. On March 10, 1978, he hosted a press conference in which he criticized Eastland for sharing his intent to seek reelection to the U.S. Senate, saying &quot;I happen to believe a young man with some stamina and vigor is needed.&quot; On March 20, Waller officially announced his own campaign for the Senate seat, declaring, &quot;We need a 60 hour a week man in Washington, not a six hour a week man.&quot; The following day Eastland withdrew his campaign. Angered by Waller&#x27;s perceived betrayal, he recruited Dantin to run against him in the Democratic primary. Sullivan and Governor Finch also entered the race. Dantin won the primary while Waller, viewed by many Democrats as ungrateful of Eastland&#x27;s support for him in 1971, placed fourth. Waller sought the Democratic nomination for governor again in 1987, running on a platform of increased highway construction, program budgeting for state agencies, and the revival of referendums. He finished third in the first primary. He supported Republican Kirk Fordice&#x27;s gubernatorial reelection campaign in 1995 and Haley Barbour&#x27;s reelection in 2007. He was opposed to removing the Confederate battle flag canton from the flag of Mississippi.

==Later life and legacy==
In 2007, Waller released an autobiography, &quot;Straight Ahead: Memoirs of a Mississippi Governor&quot;. On November 29, 2011, Waller was admitted to the St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson. He died there the following day at the age of 85 and was buried in Jessamine Cemetery in Ridgeland.

Journalist Hodding Carter III believed Waller&#x27;s time in office was &quot;inconsequential&quot;. Historian David Sansing opined that &quot;Waller was elected at a crucial time in the state&#x27;s history and his constructive leadership helped chart a new direction for Mississippi.&quot; Minor wrote that &quot;the greatest value of the Waller years&quot; was in his creation of &quot;harmony between blacks and whites in Mississippi&#x27;s highly complex society&quot;. Journalist Adam Nossiter reflected, &quot;Waller was not too keen on the integrationist goals of the civil rights movement, but Jim Crow disturbed his ideals of justice and fair play. As a prosecutor, and later as the governor, he bulled through old restrictions. He came along at a moment when, because of intensive black voter registration, the politics of his convictions were plausible.&quot;

<text>Fenerbahçe Spor Kulübü (, &quot;Fenerbahçe Sports Club&quot;), commonly known as Fenerbahçe or simply Fener, is a Turkish professional multi-sport club based in the Kadıköy district of Istanbul, Turkey. Fenerbahçe is parent to a number of different competitive departments including football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, athletics, swimming, sailing, boxing, rowing, and eSports, which have won European and domestic titles over the club&#x27;s history.

Fenerbahçe is one of the oldest and most successful multi-sport clubs in Turkey, having won as much as 13 international titles, including 12 major European titles, one World championship and three regional Balkan titles in five sports (football, basketball, wheelchair basketball, volleyball, and table tennis). They have won 10 European titles with six of their sports departments (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, wheelchair basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, and women&#x27;s table tennis), being one of two sports clubs in Turkey and one of a few in Europe to have achieved this rare feat.

Fenerbahçe is one of the most supported Turkish clubs with millions of fans inside Turkey and all over the world The club has 309,026 paid members as of 16 September 2012.

In its 101st year of 2008; with a market value of $2 billion, it surpassed Manchester United to become the world&#x27;s most valuable club. Also, in March 2008, Fenerbahçe&#x27;s record application was accepted by Guinness World Records, which envisages Fenerbahçe to have the highest number of medal and trophy achievements on the planet with its 9 departments entirely, a total of 1134 cups and medals.

==History==
===Foundation and early history===
Fenerbahçe was founded as a football club in 1907 in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, by Ziya Songülen (then Nurizade Ziya Bey), Ayetullah Bey, and Necip Okaner (then Enver Necip Bey). This group of individuals founded the club secretly in order to keep a low profile and not get into any trouble with the strict Ottoman rule. So strict that the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, forbade the Turkish youth to set up a club or engage in the game of football played by the English families that was watched in envy. The club&#x27;s name comes from Fenerbahçe, a neighbourhood in Istanbul. The name literally means &quot;lighthouse garden&quot; in Turkish (from &quot;fener&quot;, meaning &quot;lighthouse&quot;, and &quot;bahçe&quot;, meaning &quot;garden&quot;), referring to a historic lighthouse located at Fenerbahçe Cape.

Ziya Songülen was elected the first President of the club, Ayetullah Bey became the first General Secretary, and Enver Necip Okaner was given the post of the General Captain. The lighthouse situated on the Fenerbahçe Cape was a big influence on the design of the club&#x27;s first crest, which sported the yellow and white colours of daffodils around the lighthouse. The kits were also designed with yellow and white stripes. The crest and the colours of the club were changed in 1910 when Hikmet Topuzer redesigned the badge and Ziya Songülen changed the colours to yellow and navy, from then on the iconic colours of the club. Fenerbahçe&#x27;s activities were kept in secrecy until a legislation reform in 1908, when, under a new law, all football clubs had to register to exist legally.

Fenerbahçe joined the Istanbul League in 1909, finishing fifth in their first year. The founding line-up included Ziya Songülen, Ayetullah Bey, Necip Okaner, Galip Kulaksızoğlu, Hassan Sami Kocamemi, Asaf Beşpınar, Enver Yetiker, Şevkati Hulusi Bey, Fuat Hüsnü Kayacan, Hamit Hüsnü Kayacan, and Nasuhi Baydar. Fenerbahçe played against the staff of the Royal Navy that occupied Istanbul during the Turkish War of Independence. Some British soldiers formed football teams that were named after the players&#x27; speciality, for example Essex Engineers, Irish Guards, Grenadiers, and Artillery. These teams played against each other and against local football teams in Istanbul. Fenerbahçe won many of these matches. General Harrington Cup is a football tournament held in Istanbul in 1923. This tournament is one of the most important football events held in British-occupied Istanbul. General Sir Charles Harrington, who gave his name to the cup, was the commander of the British occupation forces in Istanbul at that time.
Local football teams in Istanbul and teams formed by the occupying forces participated in the tournament. The final match was played at Taksim Stadium on 1923. In this final match, Fenerbahçe and the British occupation forces team, faced each other. Fenerbahçe won this match 2-1 and won the cup.

===Branch histories===
The men&#x27;s football department is the most known of the club and has won a total of 54 domestic trophies, including a record 28 Turkish championship titles (19 Turkish Super League, six National Division, and three Turkish Football Championship titles), among others, which make the club the most successful in the country. The club is also leading the all-time table of the Turkish Super League. In international club football, Fenerbahçe won the Balkans Cup in 1968, the first international trophy won by a Turkish football team.

The men&#x27;s basketball team is one of the most successful in Turkey and also has one of the highest rankings in Europe, being the first team in Turkish basketball history to have won the EuroLeague and a match against an NBA team. They became European champions in the 2016–17 season and runners-up in 2015–16 and 2017–18. The club have played in five consecutive EuroLeague Final Fours (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) so far, which is also a Turkish record. They won another F4 in 2023.

In 2023, the women&#x27;s basketball team won the EuroLeague by defeating ÇBK Mersin Yenişehir 99–60 in the all-Turkish final. By achieving this feat, Fener became the first and only sports club in history to be crowned European champions in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. Eventually in the same year, Fenerbahçe became the first and only Turkish club to date to win the FIBA Europe SuperCup by crushing France&#x27;s LDLC ASVEL Féminin on their own homeground with a dominating victory and a point differential of 57, a record in the SuperCup&#x27;s history.

In volleyball, Fenerbahçe became the first Turkish club ever to be crowned World champions in an Olympic team sport, by winning the FIVB Volleyball Women&#x27;s Club World Championship undefeated in 2010. They also were crowned European Champions by winning the CEV Champions League in the 2011–12 season, having reached the final before in 2010. Furthermore, they won the CEV Cup in 2014.

The men&#x27;s volleyball team won the CEV Challenge Cup, also in the 2013–14 season, thus writing volleyball history as the women&#x27;s team won another continental title, the aforementioned CEV Cup, the very same day. By achieving this unparalleled feat, Fenerbahçe became the only sports club in Turkey and one of few in Europe with European titles won in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball departments. They also became Balkan Champions in 2009 and 2013.

The table tennis department of Fenerbahçe is the best in Turkey and one of the best in Europe, with the women&#x27;s team having won the ETTU Cup two times in a row, in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, which is a Turkish record. They became the only Turkish team that played in a European Champions League Final, and they won the Champions League title in 2015 undefeated, thus achieving the only Triple Crown ever for a Turkish table tennis team. The men&#x27;s team reached the final of the ETTU Cup in 2008, which is the best result for any Turkish team to date.

===Club crest and colours===
Since the club&#x27;s foundation, Fenerbahçe has used the same badge, which has only undergone minor alterations.

It was designed by Hikmet Topuzer, nicknamed Topuz Hikmet, who played as left winger, in 1910, and had made as lapel pins by Tevfik Haccar Taşçı (then Tevfik Haccar) in London. The crest consists of five colours. The white section which includes the writing &quot;Fenerbahçe Spor Kulübü ★ 1907 ★&quot; represents purity and open-heartedness, the red section represents love and attachment to the club and symbolises the Turkish flag. The yellow section symbolises other ones&#x27; envy and jealousy about Fenerbahçe, while the navy symbolises nobility. The oak leaf which rises from the navy and yellow section shows the force and the power of being a member of Fenerbahçe. The green colour of the leaf shows the success of Fenerbahçe is imperative.
Hikmet Topuzer describes the story of the emblem as below:

=== Men&#x27;s football ===
The club were founded as a football club in 1907, hence the men&#x27;s football department are the first and oldest of the club. They have won a record 28 Turkish championship titles over the course of their history, including 19 Super League titles, six National Division titles, and three former Turkish Football Championship titles. Fenerbahçe also won the Balkans Cup in 1968, the first ever international trophy won by a Turkish football club.

Galatasaray&#x27;s withdrawal and the league remaining unfinished, which was accepted as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics, caused this sport to become history in Turkey in 1924, and forced Fenerbahçe, which had focused on this sport by establishing two young teams, to end its activities.

<doc id="979547" wikidata="Q674645" url="?curid=979547" title="List of Valencian monarchs">
<text>For the majority of the Middle Ages, Valencia was a constituent part of larger polities. From the time of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Valencia was controlled by the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus and the Emirate/Caliphate of Cordoba. Following the latter&#x27;s collapse, Valencia became the seat of a Taifa state ruled by a succession of local dynasties from 1010 until it was conquered by Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, El Cid, in 1095. He ruled until his death, when his widow swore fealty to Castile, but was forced out in 1102 and Valencia fell back under the control of a Muslim Caliphate.

Again in the 1140s, Caliphate collapse led to the return of local rule, but following four changes of leadership in two years it fell under the control of neighboring Murcia, and later the Almohad Caliphate. A third time, in 1229, Valencia saw almost a decade of local rule before being conquered by Aragon in 1237. Valencia was reorganized into an administrative &#x27;Kingdom of Valencia&#x27; within the Crown of Aragon, ruled by Governors appointed by the Aragonese monarch. This arrangement continued until the formal creation of the Crown of Spain and abolition of the previous administrative kingdoms by the Nueva Planta Decrees in 1714.

<text>Havering-atte-Bower ( ) is a village in Greater London, England, in the far north of the London Borough of Havering. The village lies northeast of Charing Cross. It was one of three former parishes whose area comprised the historic Royal Liberty of Havering.

Havering-atte-Bower has been the location of a number of palaces and large houses including Bower House, The Round House, Pyrgo Palace and Havering Palace.

==Etymology==
The name is of Saxon origin and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Haueringas&quot;. The last syllable is the only clear difference in pronunciation as &quot;v&quot; was written as &quot;u&quot; in Middle English and Anglo-Norman orthography. It is an ancient folk name meaning &quot;settlement of the followers of a man called Hæfer&quot;. The history of Havering-atte-Bower today is inextricably linked with Edward the Confessor and comparison can be made with Old Windsor in Berkshire, which had a Saxon palace that predated Windsor Castle as both villages are situated on high ground and have great views into London. 

It has been suggested that Edward the Confessor would have travelled to and from his palaces at both Havering-atte-Bower and Old Windsor. A story relating to the return of a ring to Edward the Confessor and attributing the name Havering to the words &quot;have ring&quot; was widely recounted in the 17th century, but is now considered to be no earlier than the 15th century, the story of the return of the ring predating this explanation of the place name by several hundred years.

The name is recorded as &quot;Hauering atte Bower&quot; in 1272 and from this time Havering and Havering-atte-Bower are used interchangeably. The &quot;atte Bower&quot; suffix is taken to mean &quot;at the royal residence&quot; and to refer to Havering Palace which was situated here, although some link the use of &quot;&quot; to other locations in Essex such as Bowers Gifford where &quot;Bower&quot; means a rural dwelling. Circumstantially it has been suggested that a different meaning of the word &quot;&quot; relating to a dwelling specifically set aside for a woman could relate to the use of the Palace by Eleanor of Provence, mother of Henry III, when she was Queen Dowager although there is no documentary evidence for this interpretation. 

Whichever meaning is correct, it appears that the great house here was known as &quot;The Bower&quot; in the late 13th century.

==History==
The history of Havering dates back at least to Saxon times, with the format of the name indicative of an early Saxon settlement while archaeological finds in and around Havering Country Park suggest a Roman villa or similar structure in the area. The village is also steeped in royal history and Edward the Confessor was the first monarch known to take interest in the area when he established a hunting lodge which, over the years would become a palace or &#x27;bower&#x27;. It is believed, though disputed, that he may have died in the house that he had loved so much before being buried at Westminster Abbey. It appears that Havering retained this royal connection as the Domesday Book lists it has been in the possession of King Harold in 1066 and King William in 1086. At that time there were 45 households and the land consisted of 100 acres of meadow with additional woodland and a mill.

The surrounding areas, including the parishes of Hornchurch and Romford, formed the Royal Liberty of Havering from 1465 to 1892. Until the 17th century, royalty used the house of Havering Palace for various reasons, adding the architectural style of the day to the expanding palace.

Another palace, east of the village, called Pyrgo, was purchased by Henry VIII to relieve the now ageing Havering Palace. By the 17th century, the Royal Palace of Havering was in decline, and it was eventually pulled down. Pyrgo was also demolished later, in the 18th century. Only one set of plans exists from the original Havering Palace, courtesy of a survey by Lord Burghley in 1578.

The village green still has on display its original village stocks, while on the opposite side of the road is a pond known as &quot;Ducking Pond&quot;, rumoured to have been used for trials of witches. Though the name of the pond suggests such a history, hard evidence is yet to be uncovered. However, there are currently plans to construct a replica ducking stool at the site.

==Geography==
The village sits on one of the highest points in London, in the far north of the borough and near the M25 motorway. It is situated 344 feet (105 m) above sea level with striking views of east London, Essex and Kent. To the north is open countryside and to the south are the large suburban developments of Harold Hill and Collier Row.

The village is surrounded by three large parks: the dense woodlands of Havering Country Park (site of one of only two redwood plantations in England, imported from California); Bedfords Park; and Pyrgo Park. The most notable residence in the village now is Bower House, built in 1729 by John Baynes, using some of the materials of the former Havering Palace. The area is on the route of the London Loop long-distance footpath.

A village sign, funded by the East London Community Foundation and Havering-atte-Bower Conservation Society, was unveiled by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, on 3 September 2010.

==Churches and schools==
Dame Tipping School in the village was founded by Dame Anne Tipping who was daughter of Thomas Chief, a governor of the Tower of London. The school opened in 1891 and is still operating today with the same main building that was used when the school was founded, although the school has had various changes and extensions through the years .

St John the Evangelist is a Church of England church which is located facing the green. It was built in 1878 to replace an older chapel dedicated to St Mary that had its origins as part of Havering Palace. The palace also had a private chapel dedicated to St Edward.

==Transport==
Transport is limited in this area, with only one bus route, route 375.
Also see List of bus routes in London.

The nearest railway station is at Romford. There are frequent services from Romford station to London and East Anglia. Route 375 can be used to go there.

<doc id="979549" wikidata="Q5375941" url="?curid=979549" title="Endangered Species (Flaw album)">
<text>Endangered Species is the second studio album by American nu metal band Flaw. It was released on May 4, 2004. The album debuted at #42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

As explained by vocalist Chris Volz, the fairly lengthy delay between the release of &quot;Through the Eyes&quot; and &quot;Endangered Species&quot; was the result of 18 months of touring and, sequentially, the band&#x27;s desire to not hastily release an album without being happy with its contents. This album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, eliminating rapping from their signature style.

After the band&#x27;s breakup, pre-production demos for majority of the songs on the album, in addition to 7 unreleased tracks, were made available on the internet. They were quickly taken offline after Universal had words with the webmaster of the site that had illegally distributed the tracks. The webmaster was allowed by the band to put the tracks online, but he did not have the legal rights to do so from Universal. The differences between the demo and final versions are mostly lyrical, though &quot;Medicate&quot; has entirely different lyrics and a different riff in the bridge.

The album spawned one single, &quot;Recognize&quot;, which failed to receive significant radio airplay, but charted higher than any other Flaw single.

<doc id="979564" wikidata="Q30920485" url="?curid=979564" title="Near-infrared spectroscopy">
<text>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a spectroscopic method that uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (from 780 nm to 2500 nm). Typical applications include medical and physiological diagnostics and research including blood sugar, pulse oximetry, functional neuroimaging, sports medicine, elite sports training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, neonatal research, brain computer interface, urology (bladder contraction), and neurology (neurovascular coupling). There are also applications in other areas as well such as pharmaceutical, food and agrochemical quality control, atmospheric chemistry, combustion propagation.

==Theory==
Near-infrared spectroscopy is based on molecular overtone and combination vibrations. Overtones and combinations exhibit lower intensity compared to the fundamental, as a result, the molar absorptivity in the near-IR region is typically quite small. (NIR absorption bands are typically 10–100 times weaker than the corresponding fundamental mid-IR absorption band.) The lower absorption allows NIR radiation to penetrate much further into a sample than mid infrared radiation. Near-infrared spectroscopy is, therefore, not a particularly sensitive technique, but it can be very useful in probing bulk material with little to no sample preparation.

The molecular overtone and combination bands seen in the near-IR are typically very broad, leading to complex spectra; it can be difficult to assign specific features to specific chemical components. Multivariate (multiple variables) calibration techniques (e.g., principal components analysis, partial least squares, or artificial neural networks) are often employed to extract the desired chemical information. Careful development of a set of calibration samples and application of multivariate calibration techniques is essential for near-infrared analytical methods.

==History==

The discovery of near-infrared energy is ascribed to William Herschel in the 19th century, but the first industrial application began in the 1950s. In the first applications, NIRS was used only as an add-on unit to other optical devices that used other wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometers. In the 1980s, a single-unit, stand-alone NIRS system was made available.

In the 1980s, Karl Norris (while working at the USDA Instrumentation Research Laboratory, Beltsville, USA) pioneered the use NIR spectroscopy for quality assessments of agricultural products. Since then, use has expanded from food and agricultural to chemical, polymer, and petroleum industries; pharmaceutical industry; biomedical sciences; and environmental analysis. 

With the introduction of light-fiber optics in the mid-1980s and the monochromator-detector developments in the early 1990s, NIRS became a more powerful tool for scientific research. The method has been used in a number of fields of science including physics, physiology, or medicine. It is only in the last few decades that NIRS began to be used as a medical tool for monitoring patients, with the first clinical application of so-called fNIRS in 1994.

==Instrumentation==

Instrumentation for near-IR (NIR) spectroscopy is similar to instruments for the UV-visible and mid-IR ranges. There is a source, a detector, and a dispersive element (such as a prism, or, more commonly, a diffraction grating) to allow the intensity at different wavelengths to be recorded. Fourier transform NIR instruments using an interferometer are also common, especially for wavelengths above ~1000 nm. Depending on the sample, the spectrum can be measured in either reflection or transmission.

Common incandescent or quartz halogen light bulbs are most often used as broadband sources of near-infrared radiation for analytical applications. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can also be used. For high precision spectroscopy, wavelength-scanned lasers and frequency combs have recently become powerful sources, albeit with sometimes longer acquisition timescales. When lasers are used, a single detector without any dispersive elements might be sufficient.

The type of detector used depends primarily on the range of wavelengths to be measured. Silicon-based CCDs are suitable for the shorter end of the NIR range, but are not sufficiently sensitive over most of the range (over 1000 nm). InGaAs and PbS devices are more suitable and have higher quantum efficiency for wavelengths above 1100 nm. It is possible to combine silicon-based and InGaAs detectors in the same instrument. Such instruments can record both UV-visible and NIR spectra &#x27;simultaneously&#x27;.

Instruments intended for chemical imaging in the NIR may use a 2D array detector with an acousto-optic tunable filter. Multiple images may be recorded sequentially at different narrow wavelength bands.

Many commercial instruments for UV/vis spectroscopy are capable of recording spectra in the NIR range (to perhaps ~900 nm). In the same way, the range of some mid-IR instruments may extend into the NIR. In these instruments, the detector used for the NIR wavelengths is often the same detector used for the instrument&#x27;s &quot;main&quot; range of interest.

==NIRS as an analytical technique==
The use of NIR as an analytical technique did not come from extending the use of mid-IR into the near-IR range, but developed independently. A striking way this was exhibited is that, while mid-IR spectroscopists use wavenumbers (&quot;cm&quot;−1) when displaying spectra, NIR spectroscopists used wavelength (&quot;nm&quot;), as is used in ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. Early practitioners of IR spectroscopy, who depended on assignment of absorption bands to specific bond types, were frustrated by the complexity of the bonding regions being measured. However, as a quantitative tool, the lower molar absorption levels in the bonding region tended to keep absorption maxima &quot;on-scale&quot;, enabling quantitative work with little sample preparation. Techniques applied to extract the quantitative information from these complex spectra were unfamiliar to analytical chemists, and the technique was viewed with suspicion in academia.

Generally, quantitative NIR analysis is accomplished by selecting a group of calibration samples, for which the concentration of the analyte of interest has been determined by a reference method, and finding a correlation between various spectral features and those concentrations using a chemometric tool. The calibration is then validated by using it to predict the analyte values for samples in a validation set, whose values have been determined by the reference method but have not been included in the calibration. A validated calibration is then used to predict the values of samples. The complexity of the spectra are overcome by the use of multivariate calibration. The two tools most often used a multi-wavelength linear regression and partial least squares.

==Applications==
Typical applications of NIR spectroscopy include the analysis of food products, pharmaceuticals, combustion products, and a major branch of astronomical spectroscopy.

===Astronomical spectroscopy===
Near-infrared spectroscopy is used in astronomy for studying the atmospheres of cool stars where molecules can form. The vibrational and rotational signatures of molecules such as titanium oxide, cyanide, and carbon monoxide can be seen in this wavelength range and can give a clue towards the star&#x27;s spectral type. It is also used for studying molecules in other astronomical contexts, such as in molecular clouds where new stars are formed. The astronomical phenomenon known as reddening means that near-infrared wavelengths are less affected by dust in the interstellar medium, such that regions inaccessible by optical spectroscopy can be studied in the near-infrared. Since dust and gas are strongly associated, these dusty regions are exactly those where infrared spectroscopy is most useful. The near-infrared spectra of very young stars provide important information about their ages and masses, which is important for understanding star formation in general. Astronomical spectrographs have also been developed for the detection of exoplanets using the Doppler shift of the parent star due to the radial velocity of the planet around the star.

===Agriculture===
Near-infrared spectroscopy is widely applied in agriculture for determining the quality of forages, grains, and grain products, oilseeds, coffee, tea, spices, fruits, vegetables, sugarcane, beverages, fats, and oils, dairy products, eggs, meat, and other agricultural products. It is widely used to quantify the composition of agricultural products because it meets the criteria of being accurate, reliable, rapid, non-destructive, and inexpensive. Abeni and Bergoglio 2001 apply NIRS to chicken breeding as the assay method for characteristics of fat composition.

===Remote monitoring===
Techniques have been developed for NIR spectroscopic imaging. Hyperspectral imaging has been applied for a wide range of uses, including the remote investigation of plants and soils. Data can be collected from instruments on airplanes, satellites or unmanned aerial systems to assess ground cover and soil chemistry.

Remote monitoring or remote sensing from the NIR spectroscopic region can also be used to study the atmosphere. For example, measurements of atmospheric gases are made from NIR spectra measured by the OCO-2, GOSAT, and the TCCON.

===Materials science===
Techniques have been developed for NIR spectroscopy of microscopic sample areas for film thickness measurements, research into the optical characteristics of nanoparticles and optical coatings for the telecommunications industry.

===Medical uses===
The application of NIRS in medicine centres on its ability to provide information about the oxygen saturation of haemoglobin within the microcirculation. Broadly speaking, it can be used to assess oxygenation and microvascular function in the brain (cerebral NIRS) or in the peripheral tissues (peripheral NIRS).

==== Cerebral NIRS ====
When a specific area of the brain is activated, the localized blood volume in that area changes quickly. Optical imaging can measure the location and activity of specific regions of the brain by continuously monitoring blood hemoglobin levels through the determination of optical absorption coefficients.
NIRS can be used as a quick screening tool for possible intracranial bleeding cases by placing the scanner on four locations on the head. In non-injured patients the brain absorbs the NIR light evenly. When there is an internal bleeding from an injury, the blood may be concentrated in one location causing the NIR light to be absorbed more than other locations, which the scanner detects.

So-called functional NIRS can be used for non-invasive assessment of brain function through the intact skull in human subjects by detecting changes in blood hemoglobin concentrations associated with neural activity, e.g., in branches of cognitive psychology as a partial replacement for fMRI techniques. NIRS can be used on infants, and NIRS is much more portable than fMRI machines, even wireless instrumentation is available, which enables investigations in freely moving subjects. However, NIRS cannot fully replace fMRI because it can only be used to scan cortical tissue, whereas fMRI can be used to measure activation throughout the brain. Special public domain statistical toolboxes for analysis of stand alone and combined NIRS/MRI measurement have been developed.
The application in functional mapping of the human cortex is called functional NIRS (fNIRS) or diffuse optical tomography (DOT). The term diffuse optical tomography is used for three-dimensional NIRS. The terms NIRS, NIRI, and DOT are often used interchangeably, but they have some distinctions. The most important difference between NIRS and DOT/NIRI is that DOT/NIRI is used mainly to detect changes in optical properties of tissue simultaneously from multiple measurement points and display the results in the form of a map or image over a specific area, whereas NIRS provides quantitative data in absolute terms on up to a few specific points. The latter is also used to investigate other tissues such as, e.g., muscle, breast and tumors. NIRS can be used to quantify blood flow, blood volume, oxygen consumption, reoxygenation rates and muscle recovery time in muscle.

By employing several wavelengths and time resolved (frequency or time domain) and/or spatially resolved methods blood flow, volume and absolute tissue saturation (formula_1 or Tissue Saturation Index (TSI)) can be quantified. Applications of oximetry by NIRS methods include neuroscience, ergonomics, rehabilitation, brain-computer interface, urology, the detection of illnesses that affect the blood circulation (e.g., peripheral vascular disease), the detection and assessment of breast tumors, and the optimization of training in sports medicine.

The use of NIRS in conjunction with a bolus injection of indocyanine green (ICG) has been used to measure cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2).
It has also been shown that CMRO2 can be calculated with combined NIRS/MRI measurements. Additionally metabolism can be interrogated by resolving an additional mitochondrial chromophore, cytochrome-c-oxidase, using broadband NIRS.

NIRS is starting to be used in pediatric critical care, to help manage patients following cardiac surgery. Indeed, NIRS is able to measure venous oxygen saturation (SVO2), which is determined by the cardiac output, as well as other parameters (FiO2, hemoglobin, oxygen uptake). Therefore, examining the NIRS provides critical care physicians with an estimate of the cardiac output. NIRS is favoured by patients, because it is non-invasive, painless, and does not require ionizing radiation.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is another NIR medical imaging technique capable of 3D imaging with high resolution on par with low-power microscopy. Using optical coherence to measure photon pathlength allows OCT to build images of live tissue and clear examinations of tissue morphology. Due to technique differences OCT is limited to imaging 1–2 mm below tissue surfaces, but despite this limitation OCT has become an established medical imaging technique especially for imaging of the retina and anterior segments of the eye, as well as coronaries.

A type of neurofeedback, hemoencephalography or HEG, uses NIR technology to measure brain activation, primarily of the frontal lobes, for the purpose of training cerebral activation of that region.

The instrumental development of NIRS/NIRI/DOT/OCT has proceeded tremendously during the last years and, in particular, in terms of quantification, imaging and miniaturization.

==== Peripheral NIRS ====
Peripheral microvascular function can be assessed using NIRS. The oxygen saturation of haemoglobin in the tissue (StO2) can provide information about tissue perfusion. A vascular occlusion test (VOT) can be employed to assess microvascular function. Common sites for peripheral NIRS monitoring include the thenar eminence, forearm and calf muscles.

===Particle measurement===
NIR is often used in particle sizing in a range of different fields, including studying pharmaceutical and agricultural powders.

===Industrial uses===
As opposed to NIRS used in optical topography, general NIRS used in chemical assays does not provide imaging by mapping. For example, a clinical carbon dioxide analyzer requires reference techniques and calibration routines to be able to get accurate CO2 content change. In this case, calibration is performed by adjusting the zero control of the sample being tested after purposefully supplying 0% CO2 or another known amount of CO2 in the sample. Normal compressed gas from distributors contains about 95% O2 and 5% CO2, which can also be used to adjust %CO2 meter reading to be exactly 5% at initial calibration.

<text>HMCS &quot;Okanagan&quot; (S74) was an that served in the Canadian Forces (CF). She entered service in 1968 and spent the majority of her career on the east coast. The ship was paid off in 1998 and sold for scrap in 2011.

==Design==
The &quot;Oberon&quot; class were considered an improved version of the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarines, with a different frame of the pressure hull and constructed from a better grade of steel. These build differences allowed the &quot;Oberon&quot;s to have a deeper diving depth at roughly .

The submarines displaced surfaced and submerged. They measured long with a beam of and a draught of .

The boats were powered by a two shaft diesel-electric system. The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with two ASR 1 16-cylinder diesel engines creating and two English Electric motors creating . This gave the submarines a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . The boats carried 258 tons of oil giving them a range of at 12 knots.

The design was armed with eight 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried 24 reloads for a total of 30 torpedoes. Canadian boats differed from the original design by being equipped for the US Mark 37C torpedo. The longer, wire-guided Mod 2 version was carried in the forward tubes and the non-guided Mod 0 for the rear tubes.

The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with Type 187 active-passive sonar, Type 2007 passive sonar and Type 2019 sonar.

===Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP)===
By the late 1970s, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s in Canadian service had become obsolete and were in need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979. In an effort to take the subs from anti-submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, periscopes, communications and fire-control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mark 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.

The SOUP refits comprised a new US fire control system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar was placed in the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mark 48 torpedoes, however the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalized in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1986, one of the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s was out of service undergoing the refit. SOUP came in on time and on its budget of C$45 million in 1986. SOUP kept the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s operational until the end of the 1990s when they were replaced by the British s.

==Acquisition==

In March 1962, the Cabinet recommended the purchase of three &quot;Oberon&quot;s and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada. On 11 April 1962, the purchase was announced in the House of Commons of Canada by the Minister of National Defence, Douglas Harkness.

However, the Conservative government postponed the acquisition of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s due to the slow speed of the United Kingdom&#x27;s attempt to offset the acquisition. The Conservative government was defeated in 1963 and the incoming Liberal government suspended all major defence procurement projects upon taking power. The final price of C$40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963. However, due to Canadian modifications to the design, that number climbed to C$51.4 million.

Since &quot;Onyx&quot; was already under construction, the boat was finished to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original &quot;Oberon&quot; design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew. The three submarines were acquired for service as &quot;clockwork mice&quot;, submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.

==Construction and career==

The submarine, built at Chatham Dockyard in England, was laid down on 25 March 1965, and launched on 17 September 1966 by Monique Cadieux, the wife of the Associate Minister of Canadian National Defence. She was commissioned on 22 June 1968 at Chatham. She was also the final submarine constructed at Chatham Dockyard. The submarine was named after the Okanagan First Nations people, and was assigned the pennant number S 74.

&quot;Okanagan&quot; was assigned to the First Canadian Submarine Squadron, joined by her sister boats and served her entire career with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) in the North Atlantic. &quot;Okanagan&quot; spent time training with the Royal Navy after an exchange program was instituted in the 1960s that would see submarines from both the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy spend time with each other&#x27;s forces. This allowed Canadian submarines on intelligence-gathering missions. Beginning in the 1970s, Canada began underwater surveillance patrols in the western Atlantic, tracking Soviet sub and surface fleet vessels, especially the ballistic missile submarines, usually in concert with an Argus or Aurora patrol aircraft.

In July 1973, &quot;Okanagan&quot; collided with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel while exercising in British waters off the coast of Scotland. The submarine was running submerged off the mouth of the River Clyde when the tanker hit &quot;Okanagan&quot;. There were no injuries to the submarine&#x27;s complement. However, the submarine suffered damaged to her fin and mast. The submarine returned to Faslane to effect repairs.

On 30 June 1983, &quot;Okanagan&quot; was deployed on a 19-day anti-Soviet submarine patrol. &quot;Okanagan&quot; underwent her SOUP refit beginning in 1984, being handed over to HMC Dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 2 April. The refit began on 12 June 1985 and lasted until 7 April 1986. Following the SOUP refit and the introduction of the Mark 48 torpedoes, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were considered fully operational and counted the same as other offensive fleet units in Maritime Command (MARCOM).

In October–November 1990, &quot;Okanagan&quot; cruised the Great Lakes, the first Canadian submarine to do so. Following the end of the Cold War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were retasked, performing patrols on behalf of federal institutions such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Solicitor General of Canada between 1991 and 1994. The delay of the introduction of the &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines led to the &quot;Oberon&quot;s working past their life expectancy. During the Turbot War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were tasked with monitoring European fishing fleets off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Their presence served as a deterrent in the escalating crisis.

In early September 1998, &quot;Okanagan&quot; was used for a successful search of the ocean floor off the coast of Nova Scotia for the flight recorders of the crashed Swissair Flight 111. She was paid off from MARCOM on 12 September 1998.

In May 2005, the &quot;Halifax Chronicle-Herald&quot; announced that MARCOM was looking to sell &quot;Okanagan&quot; for scrap metal, along with three other Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s laid up at CFB Halifax. MARCOM stated that the submarines were not in suitable condition to be used as museum ships and predicted that each submarine would sell for between C$50,000 and C$60,000. &quot;Okanagan&quot; was towed to a scrapyard in Port Maitland, Ontario in August 2011.

<text>The Limestone Coast is a name used since the early twenty-first century for a South Australian government region located in the south east of South Australia which immediately adjoins the continental coastline and the Victorian border. The name is also used for a tourist region and a wine zone both located in the same part of South Australia.

== Extent==
The Limestone Coast is a South Australian Government Region which consists of land within the following local government areas located in the south east of the state: the City of Mount Gambier and the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale and the Wattle Range Council, and the extent of &quot;coastal waters&quot; up to three nautical miles seaward of the low water mark between the border with Victoria in the east and the northern boundary of the Kingston District Council in the north-west.

===Industry regions with the same name===

====Limestone Coast Tourism Region====
The words &#x27;Limestone Coast&#x27; also used in the name of a tourism region which occupies a similar part of South Australia. The tourism region consists of the following local government areas: the City of Mount Gambier, The Coorong District Council, the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale, and the Wattle Range Council.

====Limestone Coast Wine Zone====

The words &#x27;Limestone Coast&#x27; also used in the name of a wine zone which occupies a similar part of South Australia. The wine zone is the land south of a line located at appropriately 36 degrees 50 minutes south, i.e. in line with Cape Willoughby at the east end of Kangaroo Island. The zone includes the following wine-growing regions: Coonawarra, Mount Benson, Mount Gambier, Padthaway, Robe and Wrattonbully.

==Location and description==

From the Victoria border to the Younghusband Peninsula this area has been settled since colonisation by mainly European settlers in the 1840s, displacing an indigenous population that had resided in the region for thousands of years. The region currently supports farming, viticulture, forestry and tourism. Towns include Bordertown, Keith, Millicent, Mount Gambier, Penola, and Naracoorte and the coastal resorts of Beachport, Kingston SE and Robe.

Much of the Limestone Coast is low-lying, and was inundated by sea as recently as 2 million years ago. It had previously also been flooded 15–20 million years ago. The plains are lined by rows of low sandhills parallel to the coast, created at times when the coastline was at that level. Prior to European settlement, much of the land between the sandhills was swamp fed by streams and subject to inundation. A network of drains totalling 1450 km has been constructed to channel the water away through the sandhills to the ocean. Important areas of wetland remain including the lakes and lagoons such as the southern end of the Coorong and Bool Lagoon. Meanwhile, areas of upland in the Limestone Coast include the volcanic craters of Mount Gambier.

The Mediterranean climate of this coast is cool and moist with wet winters.

==History==

There are deep limestone deposits created from the coral and other sealife. The limestone in Victoria Fossil Cave and the other Naracoorte Caves contains are Australia&#x27;s biggest source of fossils and a World Heritage Site.

==Ecology==
===Flora===
The natural vegetation was woodland of River Red gum and other eucalyptus trees.

===Fauna===
Although there are few purely endemic species the coast is rich in wildlife including possums, &quot;Cercartetus&quot; pygmy possums, &quot;Petaurus&quot; Gliding possums, and other marsupials many of which do not spread further west than here. Endemic species include reptiles such as the striped legless lizard &quot;(Delma impar)&quot; and invertebrates like an endemic cave cricket. The Naracoorte caves are occupied by the common bent-wing bat.

The lakes and lagoons are particularly important habitats for waterbirds such as black swan, grey teal, Pacific black duck, and especially the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot &quot;(Neophema chrysogaster)&quot; which winters here along with many other birds including the red-necked stint (&quot;Calidris ruficollis&quot;), sharp-tailed sandpiper (&quot;Calidris acuminata&quot;), and curlew sandpiper (&quot;Calidris ferruginea&quot;).

Most of the original habitat has been cleared for agriculture and only fragments remain (particularly in areas of wetland) with Coorong National Park and Canunda National Park being the largest areas. Therefore, most indigenous wildlife has also disappeared or been severely reduced in number with introduced species of animals an ongoing threat to that which remains.

<doc id="979579" wikidata="Q205042" url="?curid=979579" title="Duffy antigen system">
<text>Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC), also known as Fy glycoprotein (FY) or CD234 (Cluster of Differentiation 234), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;ACKR1&quot; gene.

The Duffy antigen is located on the surface of red blood cells, and is named after the patient in whom it was discovered. The protein encoded by this gene is a glycosylated membrane protein and a non-specific receptor for several chemokines. The protein is also the receptor for the human malarial parasites &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium knowlesi&quot; and simian malarial parasite &quot;Plasmodium cynomolgi&quot;. Polymorphisms in this gene are the basis of the Duffy blood group system.

== History ==

It was noted in the 1920s that black Africans had some intrinsic resistance to malaria, but the basis for this remained unknown. The Duffy antigen gene was the fourth gene associated with the resistance after the genes responsible for sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

In 1950, the Duffy antigen was discovered in a multiply-transfused hemophiliac named Richard Duffy, whose serum contained the first example of anti-Fya antibody.
In 1951, the antibody to a second antigen, Fyb, was discovered in serum. Using these two antibodies, three common phenotypes were defined: Fy(a+b+), Fy(a+b-), and Fy(a-b+).

Several other types were later discovered bringing the current total up to 6: Fya, Fyb, Fy3, Fy4, Fy5 and Fy6. Only Fya, Fyb and Fy3 are considered clinically important. Reactions to Fy5 have also rarely been reported. The Fy4 antigen, originally described on Fy (a–b–) RBCs, is now thought to be a distinct, unrelated antigen and is no longer included in the FY system.

== Genetics and genomics ==

The Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene (gp-Fy; CD234) is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1.q22-1.q23) and was cloned in 1993. The gene was first localised to chromosome 1 in 1968, and was the first blood system antigen to be localised. It is a single copy gene spanning over 1500 bases and is in two exons. The gene encodes a 336 amino acid acidic glycoprotein. It carries the antigenic determinants of the Duffy blood group system which consist of four codominant alleles—FY*A and FY*B—coding for the Fy-a and Fy-b antigens respectively, FY*X and FY*Fy, five phenotypes (Fy-a, Fy-b, Fy-o, Fy-x and Fy-y) and five antigens. Fy-x is a form of Fy-b where the Fy-b gene is poorly expressed. Fy-x is also known as Fy-bweak or Fy-bWk.

This gene has been redesignated &quot;ACKR1&quot;.

Fy-a and Fy-b differ by in a single amino acid at position 42: glycine in Fy-a and aspartic acid in Fy-b (guanine in Fy-a and adenosine in Fy-b at position 125). A second mutation causing a Duffy negative phenotype is known: the responsible mutation is G -&gt; A at position 298. The genetic basis for the Fy(a-b-) phenotype is a point mutation in the erythroid specific promoter (a T -&gt; C mutation at position -33 in the GATA box). This mutation occurs in the Fy-b allele and has been designated Fy-bEs (erythroid silent). Two isotypes have been identified. The Fy-x allele is characterized by a weak anti-Fy-b reaction and appears to be the result of two separate transitions: Cytosine265Threonine (Arginine89Cysteine) and Guanine298Adenosine (Alanine100Threonine). A third mutation (a transversion) in this gene has also been described - G145T (Alanine49Serine) - that has been associated with the Fy-x phenotype.

Most Duffy negative black people carry a silent Fy-b allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -33, impairing the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor. The gene is still transcribed in non erythroid cells in the presence of this mutation.

The Duffy negative phenotype occurs at low frequency among whites (~3.5%) and is due to a third mutation that results in an unstable protein (Arg89Cys: cytosine -&gt; thymidine at position 265).

The silent allele has evolved at least twice in the black population of Africa and evidence for selection for this allele has been found. The selection pressure involved here appears to be more complex than many text books might suggest. An independent evolution of this phenotype occurred in Papua New Guinea has also been documented.

A comparative study of this gene in seven mammalian species revealed significant differences between species. The species examined included &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot; (chimpanzee), &quot;Macaca mulatta&quot; (rhesus monkey), &quot;Pongo pygmaeus&quot; (orangutan), &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; (brown rat), &quot;Mus musculus&quot; (mouse), &quot;Monodelphis domestica&quot; (opossum), &quot;Bos taurus&quot; (cow) and &quot;Canis familiaris&quot; (dog).

Three exons are present in humans and chimpanzees, whereas only two exons occur in the other species. This additional exon is located at the 5&#x27; end and is entirely non coding. Both intron and exon size vary considerably between the species examined. Between the chimpanzee and the human, 24 differences in the nucleotide sequence were noted. Of these 18 occurred in non coding regions. Of the remaining 6, 3 were synonymous and 3 non synonymous mutations. The significance of these mutations if any is not known.

The mouse ortholog has been cloned and exhibits 63% homology to the human gene at the amino acid level. The mouse gene is located on chromosome 1 between the genetic markers Xmv41 and D1Mit166. The mouse gene has two exons (100 and 1064 nucleotides in length), separated by a 461 base pair intron. In the mouse DARC is expressed during embryonic development between days 9.5 and 12.

In yellow baboons (&quot;Papio cynocephalus&quot;) mutations in this gene have been associated with protection from infection with species of the genus &quot;Hepatocystis&quot;.

The ancestral form of extant DARC alleles in humans appears to be the FY*B allele.

The gene appears to be under strong purifying selection. The cause of this selective pressure has not yet been identified.

== Molecular biology ==

Biochemical analysis of the Duffy antigen has shown that it has a high content of α-helical secondary structure - typical of chemokine receptors. Its N-glycans are mostly of the triantennary complex type terminated with α2-3- and α2-6-linked sialic acid residues with bisecting GlcNAc and α1-6-linked fucose at the core.

The Duffy antigen is expressed in greater quantities on reticulocytes than on mature erythrocytes. While the Duffy antigen is expressed on bone marrow erythroblasts and circulating erythrocytes it is also found on Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, endothelial cells of thyroid capillaries, the post-capillary venules of some organs including the spleen, liver and kidney and the large pulmonary venules. Duffy antigen has then a very unique cell expression profile in cerebellar neurons, venular endothelial cells and erythroid cells.
In some people who lack the Duffy antigen on their erythrocytes it is still expressed in the other cell types.

It has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagine (Asn) 16 and Asn27.

The Duffy antigen has been found to act as a multispecific receptor for chemokines of both the C-C and C-X-C families, including:
* monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) - CCL2
* regulated upon activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) - CCL5
* melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MSGA-α), KC, neutrophil-activating protein 3 (NAP-3) - CXCL1/CXCL2

and the angiogenic CXC chemokines:
* Growth related gene alpha (GRO-α) - CXCL1
* Platelet factor 4 - CXCL4
* ENA-78 - CXCL5
* Neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2) - CXCL7
* Interleukin-8 (IL-8) - CXCL8

Consequently, the Fy protein is also known as DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines). The chemokine binding site on the receptor appears to be localised to the amino terminus. The antigen is predicted to have 7 transmembrane domains, an exocellular N-terminal domain and an endocellular C-terminal domain. Alignment with other seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors shows that DARC lacks the highly conserved DRY motif in the second intracellular loop of the protein that is known to be associated with G-protein signaling. Consistent with this finding ligand binding by DARC does not induce G-protein coupled signal transduction nor a Ca2+ flux unlike other chemokine receptors. Based on these alignments the Duffy antigen is considered to be most similar to the interleukin-8B receptors.

Scatchard analysis of competition binding studies has shown high affinity binding to the Duffy antigen with dissociation constants (KD) binding values of 24 ± 4.9, 20 ± 4.7, 41.9 ± 12.8, and 33.9 ± 7 nanoMoles for MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES and monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 respectively.

In DARC-transfected cells, DARC is internalized following ligand binding and this led to the hypothesis that expression of DARC on the surface of erythrocytes, endothelial, neuronal cells and epithelial cells may act as a sponge and provide a mechanism by which inflammatory chemokines may be removed from circulation as well as their concentration modified in the local environment. This hypothesis has also been questioned after knock out mice were created. These animals appeared healthy and had normal responses to infection. While the function of the Duffy antigen remains presently (2006) unknown, evidence is accumulating that suggests a role in neutrophil migration from the blood into the tissues and in modulating the inflammatory response.

The protein is also known to interact with the protein KAI1 (CD82) a surface glycoprotein of leukocytes and may have a role in the control of cancer.

The Duffy antigen has been shown to exist as a constitutive homo-oligomer and that it hetero-oligomerizes with the CC chemokine receptor CCR5 (CD195). The formation of this heterodimer impairs chemotaxis and calcium flux through CCR5, whereas internalization of CCR5 in response to ligand binding remains unchanged.

DARC has been shown to internalise chemokines but does not scavenge them. It mediates chemokine transcytosis, which leads to apical retention of intact chemokines and more leukocyte migration.

Binding melanoma growth-stimulating activity inhibits the binding of &quot;P. knowlesi&quot; to DARC.

== Population genetics ==

Differences in the racial distribution of the Duffy antigens were discovered in 1954, when it was found that the overwhelming majority of people of African descent had the erythrocyte phenotype Fy(a-b-): 68% in African Americans and 88-100% in African people (including more than 90% of West African people). This phenotype is exceedingly rare in Whites. Because the Duffy antigen is uncommon in those of Black African descent, the presence of this antigen has been used to detect genetic admixture. In a sample of unrelated African Americans (n = 235), Afro-Caribbeans (n = 90) and Colombians (n = 93), the frequency of the -46T (Duffy positive) allele was 21.7%, 12.2% and 74.7% respectively.

Overall the frequencies of Fya and Fyb antigens in Whites are 66% and 83% respectively, in Asians 99% and 18.5% respectively and in blacks 10% and 23% respectively. The frequency of Fy3 is 100% Whites, 99.9% Asians and 32% Blacks. Phenotype frequencies are:
* Fy(a+b+): 49% Whites, 1% Blacks, 9% Chinese
* Fy(a-b+): 34% Whites, 22% Blacks, &lt;1% Chinese
* Fy(a+b-): 17% Whites, 9% Blacks, 91% Chinese

While a possible role in the protection of humans from malaria had been previously suggested, this was only confirmed clinically in 1976. Since then many surveys have been carried out to elucidate the prevalence of Duffy antigen alleles in different populations including:
* The mutation Ala100Thr (G -&gt; A in the first codon position—base number 298) within the FY*B allele was thought to be purely a White genotype, but has since been described in Brazilians. However, the study&#x27;s authors point out that the Brazilian population has arisen from intermarriage between Portuguese, Black Africans, and Indians, which accounts for the presence of this mutation in a few members of Brazil&#x27;s non-White groups. Two of the three Afro-Brazilian test subjects that were found to have the mutation (out of a total of 25 Afro-Brazilians tested) were also related to one another, as one was a mother and the other her daughter.
* This antigen along with other blood group antigens was used to identify the Basque people as a genetically separate group. Its use in forensic science is under consideration.
* The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, part of India, were originally inhabited by 14 aboriginal tribes. Several of these have gone extinct. One surviving tribe—the Jarawas—live in three jungle areas of South Andaman and one jungle area in Middle Andaman. The area is endemic for malaria. The causative species is &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;: there is no evidence for the presence of &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;. Blood grouping revealed an absence of both Fy(a) and Fy(b) antigens in two areas and a low prevalence in two others.
* In the Yemenite Jews the frequency of the Fy allele is 0.5879. The frequency of this allele varies from 0.1083 to 0.2191 among Jews from the Middle East, North Africa and Southern Europe. The incidence of Fya among Ashkenazi Jews is 0.44 and among the non-Ashkenazi Jews it is 0.33. The incidence of Fyb is higher in both groups with frequencies of 0.53 and 0.64 respectively.
* In the Chinese ethnic populations—the Han and the She people—the frequencies of Fya and Fyb alleles were 0.94 and 0.06 and 0.98 and 0.02 respectively.
* The frequency of the Fya allele in most Asian populations is ~95%.
* In Grande Comore (also known as Ngazidja) the frequency of the Fy(a- b-) phenotype is 0.86.
* The incidence of Fy(a+b-) in northern India among blood donors is 43.85%.
* In the Maghreb, Horn of Africa and the Nile Valley, the Afroasiatic (Hamitic-Semitic) speaking populations are largely Duffy-positive. Between 70%-98% of Hamito-Semitic groups in Ethiopia were found to be Duffy-positive. Serological and DNA based analysis of 115 unrelated Tunisians also found an FY*X frequency of 0.0174; FY*1 = 0.291 (expressed 0.260, silent 0.031); FY*2 = 0.709 (expressed 0.427; silent 0.282). Since the FY*2 silent is the most common allele in West Africa, its minor occurrence in the sample probably represents recent diffusion from the latter region.
* In Nouakchott, Mauritania overall 27% of the population are Duffy-positive. 54% of Moors are Duffy antigen positive, while only 2% of black ethnic groups (mainly Poular, Soninke and Wolof) are Duffy positive.
* A map of the Duffy antigen distribution has been produced. The most prevalent allele globally is FY*A. Across sub-Saharan Africa the predominant allele is the silent FY*BES variant.
* In Iran the Fy (a-b-) phenotype was found in 3.4%.

There appears to have been a selective sweep in Africa which reduced the incidence of this antigen there. This sweep appears to have occurred between 6,500 and 97,200 years ago (95% confidence interval)

The distribution within India has been studied in some detail.

== Clinical significance ==

Historically the role of this antigen other than its importance as a receptor for Plasmodium protozoa has not been appreciated. Recent work has identified a number of additional roles for this protein.

=== Malaria ===

On erythrocytes, the Duffy antigen acts as a receptor for invasion by the human malarial parasites &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;. This was first shown in 1980. Duffy negative individuals whose erythrocytes do not express the receptor are believed to be resistant to merozoite invasion although &quot;P. vivax&quot; infection has been reported in Duffy negative children in Kenya, suggesting a role in resistance to disease, not infection. This antigen may also play a role in erythrocyte invasion in the rodent malarial parasite &quot;P. yoelii&quot;. The epitope Fy6 is required for &quot;P. vivax&quot; invasion.

The protection to &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria conferred by the absence of the Duffy antigen appears to be very limited at best in Madagascar. Although 72% of the population are Duffy antigen negative, 8.8% of the Duffy antigen negative individuals were asymptomatic carriers of &quot;P. vivax&quot;. Malaria has also been found in Angola and Equatorial Guinea in Duffy negative individuals. &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria in a Duffy antigen negative individual in Mauritania has also been reported. Similar infections have been reported in Brazil and Kenya. Additional cases of infection in Duffy antigen negative individuals have been reported from the Congo and Uganda. A study in Brazil of the protection against &quot;P. vivax&quot; offered by the lack of the Duffy antigen found no differential resistance to malaria vivax between Duffy antigen positive and negative individuals.

Nancy Ma&#x27;s night monkey (&quot;A. nancymaae&quot;) is used as an animal model of &quot;P. vivax&quot; infection. This species&#x27; erythrocytes possess the Duffy antigen and this antigen is used as the receptor for &quot;P. vivax&quot; on the erythrocytes in this species.

Examination of this gene in 497 patients in the Amazonas State, Brazil, made by the doctor Sérgio Albuquerque, suggests that the genotypes FY*A/FY*B-33 and FY*B/FY*B-33 (where -33 refers to the null mutation at position -33 in the GATA box) may have an advantage over the genotypes FY*A/FY*B and FY*A/FY*A, FY*A/FY*B, FY*A/FY*X and FY*B/FY*X. FY*A/FY*B and FY*A/FY*A genotypes showed to be associated with increased rates of &quot;P. vivax&quot; infection and FY*B/FY*X and FY*A/FY*X were shown to be associated with the low levels of parasitism.

A difference between the susceptibility to &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; malaria has been reported. Erythrocytes expressing Fya had 41-50% lower binding of &quot;P. vivax&quot; compared with Fyb cells. Individuals with the Fy(a+b-) phenotype have a 30-80% reduced risk of clinical vivax but not falciparum malaria.

The binding of platelet factor 4 (CXCL4) appears to be critical for the platelet induced killing of &quot;P. falciparum.

The Duffy antigen binding protein in &quot;P. vivax&quot; is composed of three subdomains and is thought to function as a dimer. The critical DARC binding residues are concentrated at the dimer interface and along a relatively flat surface spanning portions of two subdomains.

A study in Brazil confirmed the protective effect of FY*A/FY*O against malaria. In contrast the genotype FY*B/FY*O was associated with a greater risk.

=== Asthma ===

Asthma is more common and tends to be more severe in those of African descent. There appears to be a correlation with both total IgE levels and asthma and mutations in the Duffy antigen.

=== Hematopoiesis ===

Duffy antigen plays a fundamental role on hematopoiesis. Indeed, nucleated red blood cells present in the bone marrow have high expression of DARC, which facilitates their direct contact with hematopoietic stem cells. The absence of erythroid DARC alters hematopoiesis including stem and progenitor cells, which ultimately gives rise to phenotypically distinct neutrophils. As a result, mature neutrophils of Duffy-negative individuals carry more molecular &quot;weapons&quot; against infectious pathogens. Therefore, alternative physiological patterns of hematopoiesis and bone marrow cell outputs depend on the expression of DARC in the erythroid lineage.

=== Benign ethnic neutropenia ===

Individuals with the Duffy-null genotype have a persistently lower neutrophil count than the typical laboratory normal range, but the lower amount of circulating neutrophils associated with this genotype does not seem to confer an increased risk of infection. Clinical use of the term &quot;benign ethnic neutropenic&quot; to describe this phenomenon remains widespread, but the term is problematic as the Duffy-null genotype is common in individuals with African and certain Middle Eastern ancestries, and the term implies that individuals with European ancestry have the normal reference neutrophil count. The term &quot;Duffy-null associated neutrophil count&quot; (DANC) has been proposed as a replacement.

The distinctive neutrophils that are formed in the absence of DARC on erythroid lineage (see above - role of DARC on hematopoiesis) readily leave the blood stream, which explains the apparent lower numbers of neutrophils in the blood of Duffy-null individuals. Failure to recognize that individuals with African ancestry often have healthy Duffy-null antigen-associated neutrophil counts instead of neutropenia has historically contributed to inequity in access to medications that require blood monitoring due to risk of neutropenia, including chemotherapy and the antipsychotic medication clozapine. The lower number of circulating neutrophils can cause individuals with the Duffy-null genotype to fall below what typically would be considered safe to continue these treatments, despite new data showing that neutrophil functioning is preserved in these individuals.

=== Cancer ===

Interactions between the metastasis suppressor KAI1 on tumor cells and the cytokine receptor DARC on adjacent vascular cells suppresses tumor metastasis. In human breast cancer samples low expression of the DARC protein is significantly associated with estrogen receptor status, both lymph node and distant metastasis and poor survival.

=== Endotoxin response ===

The procoagulant response to lipopolysaccharide (bacterial endotoxin) is reduced in Duffy antigen negative Africans compared with Duffy positive Whites. This difference is likely to involve additional genes.

=== HIV infection ===

A connection has been found between HIV susceptibility and the expression of the Duffy antigen. The absence of the DARC receptor appears to increase the susceptibility to infection by HIV. However once established, the absence of the DARC receptor appears to slow down the progression of the disease.

HIV-1 appears to be able to attach to erythrocytes via DARC.

The association between the Duffy antigen and HIV infection appears to be complex. Leukopenia (a low total white cell count) is associated with relatively poor survival in HIV infection and this association is more marked in whites than in people of Black African descent, despite the (on average) lower white cell counts found in black Africans. This difference appears to correlate with a particular genotype (-46C/C) associated with the absence of the Duffy antigen. This genotype has only been found in black Africans and their descendants. The strength of this association increases inversely with the total white cell count. The basis for this association is probably related to the role of the Duffy antigen in cytokine binding but this has yet to be verified.

A study of 142 black South African high-risk female sex workers over 2 years revealed a seroconversion rate of 19.0%. Risk of seroconversion appeared to be correlated with Duffy-null-associated low neutrophil counts.

===Inflammation===

An association with the levels monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 has been reported.

In the Sardinian population, an association of several variants in the DARC gene (coding and non-coding) correlates with increased serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP -1). A new variant in this population, consisting of the amino acid substitution of arginine for a cysteine at position 89 of the protein diminishes the ability to bind chemokines.

DARC has also been linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), possibly displaying chemokines such as CXCL5 on the surface of endothelial cells within the synovium, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils in the disease state.

=== Lung transplantation ===

The Duffy antigen has been implicated in lung transplantation rejection.

=== Multiple myeloma ===

An increased incidence of Duffy antigen has been reported in patients with multiple myeloma compared with healthy controls.

=== Pneumonia ===

The Duffy antigen is present in the normal pulmonary vascular bed. Its expression is increased in the vascular beds and alveolar septa of the lung parenchyma during suppurative pneumonia.

=== Pregnancy ===

Duffy antigen has been implicated in haemolytic disease of the newborn.

=== Prostate cancer ===

Experimental work has suggested that DARC expression inhibits prostate tumor growth. Men of black African descent are at greater risk of prostate cancer than are men of either European or Asian descendant (60% greater incidence and double the mortality compared to Whites). However, the contribution of DARC to this increased risk has been tested in Jamaican males of black African descent. It was found that none of the increased risk could be attributed to the DARC gene. The reason for this increased risk is as yet unknown.

=== Renal transplantion ===

Antibodies and a cellular response to the Duffy antigen have been associated with renal transplant rejection.

=== Sickle cell anaemia ===

Duffy antigen-negative individuals with sickle cell anaemia tend to sustain more severe organ damage than do those with the Duffy antigen. Duffy-positive patients exhibit higher counts of white blood cells, polynuclear neutrophils, higher plasma levels of IL-8 and RANTES than Duffy-negative patients.

=== Southeast Asian ovalocytosis ===

There is a ~10% increase in Fy expression in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis erythrocytes.

=== Transfusion medicine ===

A Duffy negative blood recipient may have a transfusion reaction if the donor is Duffy positive. Since most Duffy-negative people are of African descent, blood donations from people of black African origin are important to transfusion banks.

==Transfusion data==
International Society for Blood Transfusion (ISBT) symbol: FY

ISBT number: 008

Gene symbol: FY

Gene name: Duffy blood group

Number of Duffy antigens: 6

===Antibody type===
Almost entirely IgG. IgG1 usually predominates. IgM does occur but is rare.

===Antibody behavior===
Anti-Fya is a common antibody while anti-Fyb is approximately 20 times less common., They are reactive at body temperature and are therefore clinically significant, although they do not typically bind complement. Antibodies are acquired through exposure (pregnancy or history of blood transfusion) and subsequent alloimmunization. They display dosage (react more strongly to homozygous cells versus heterozygous cells).

===Transfusion reactions===
Typically mild but may be serious, even fatal. Although these usually occur immediately they may occur after a delay (up to 24 hours). These reactions are usually caused by anti-Fya or anti-Fyb. anti-Fy3 may cause acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, but only rarely. Anti-Fy5 may also cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.

===Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn===
Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn is typically mild but rarely may be serious. Almost always due to anti-Fya and rarely anti-Fyb or Fy3.

<text>The Coonawarra wine region is a wine region centred on the town of Coonawarra in the Limestone Coast zone of South Australia. It is known for the Cabernet Sauvignon wines produced on its &quot;terra rossa&quot; soil. The name has been said to have originated in Bindjali, an Aboriginal language, meaning &quot;wild honeysuckle&quot;. It is about south-east of Adelaide, close to the border with Victoria.

==History==

The Aboriginal Australians living in the area when Europeans arrived were the Bindjali people, The word &quot;coonawarra&quot; is reported to have been their word for honeysuckle, although this meaning has also been ascribed to Penola by the same source.

The first vines were planted by John Riddoch at Yallum, South Australia in 1890. Only the Redman family of Rouge Homme continued to produce table wine during this period, during which Shiraz was the main grape variety grown.

Fortunes changed when Samuel Wynn recognised the potential of the strip of terra rossa soil, and bought the original Riddoch cellars in 1951. Led by Wynns and Penfolds, Coonawarra was to play a leading role in the transformation of the Australian wine industry as it changed from making fortified wines to conventional table wines.

==Geology==
Coonawarra&#x27;s terra rossa soil is one of the notable terroirs of the New World, covering an area of just 15 km x 2 km north of Penola. It lies on a shallow limestone ridge, raising it above the swampy land either side – it is no coincidence that the Riddoch Highway follows this ridge as carters sought the firmest ground in times past. This special bright red soil is clearly visible on an aerial photo.

To the west of the ridge lies black rendzina soil which is poorly drained, and so is much less favourable for vines. There is also a &#x27;transitional&#x27;, or brown rendzina, soil which grows vines quite successfully. This geological complexity led to many disputes during an eight-year period before Coonawarra was entered on the Register of Protected Names. At least one vineyard (belonging to Penola High School) has the boundary pass through the middle.

==Climate==
Being just 60 km from the sea, Coonawarra has a somewhat maritime climate not dissimilar to Bordeaux. During the growing season, there is just 219mm rainfall (Oct-Apr), out of 585mm annually. Extensive cloud cover keeps the temperature down to 19.1 °C in January.

==Grape varieties==

Coonawarra is synonymous with Cabernet Sauvignon, full of plum and blackcurrant fruit, so much so that successes with other grape varieties is overlooked. In the early days Shiraz was the most widely planted grape, and it produces some star wines such as Wynns Coonawarra Estate Michael Shiraz (formerly Michael Hermitage). The limestone geology also suits Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon blanc.

== Wineries ==
Coonawarra has a membership organisation for wineries, the Coonawarra Vignerons Association. Some of the wineries with cellar doors include Wynns Coonawarra Estate. Other wineries who use fruit from the Coonawarra include Yalumba and Penfolds.

<doc id="979587" wikidata="Q51572" url="?curid=979587" title="HMCS Ojibwa">
<text>HMCS &quot;Ojibwa is an that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) and later the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command]] (MARCOM). Originally intended for service with the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Onyx, the submarine was transferred to Canadian ownership before completion, and entered RCN service in 1965. &quot;Ojibwa&quot; operated primarily with Maritime Forces Atlantic until her decommissioning in 1998. In 2010, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; was laid up at CFB Halifax awaiting disposal, with the Elgin Military Museum planning to preserve her as a museum vessel. The submarine was towed to Port Burwell, Ontario in 2012, and was opened to the public in 2013. She is now the new focal point of a planned Museum of Naval History to be built alongside.

==Design==
The &quot;Oberon&quot; class were considered an improved version of the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarines, with a different frame of the pressure hull and constructed from a better grade of steel. These build differences allowed the &quot;Oberon&quot;s to have a deeper diving depth at roughly .

The submarines displaced surfaced and submerged. They measured long with a beam of and a draught of .

The boats were powered by a two shaft diesel-electric system. The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with two ASR 1 16-cylinder diesel engines creating and two English Electric motors creating . This gave the submarines a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . The boats carried 258 tons of oil giving them a range of at 12 knots.

The design was armed with eight torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried 24 reloads for a total of 30 torpedoes. Canadian boats differed from the original design by being equipped for the US Mark 37C torpedo. The longer, wire-guided Mod 2 version was carried in the forward tubes and the non-guided Mod 0 for the rear tubes.

The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with Type 187 active-passive sonar, Type 2007 passive sonar and Type 2019 sonar.

===Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP)===
By the late 1970s, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s in Canadian service had become obsolete and were in need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979. In an effort to take the subs from anti-submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, periscopes, communications and fire-control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mark 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.

The SOUP refits comprised a new US fire control system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar was placed in the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mark 48 torpedoes, however the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalized in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1986, one of the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s was out of service undergoing the refit. SOUP came in on time and on its budget of C$45 million in 1986. SOUP kept the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s operational until the end of the 1990s when they were replaced by the British s.

==Acquisition==
In March 1962, the Cabinet recommended the purchase of three &quot;Oberon&quot;s and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada. On 11 April 1962, the purchase was announced in the House of Commons of Canada by the Minister of National Defence, Douglas Harkness.

However, the Conservative government postponed the acquisition of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s due to the slow speed of the United Kingdom&#x27;s attempt to offset the acquisition. The Conservative government was defeated in 1963 and the incoming Liberal government suspended all major defence procurement projects upon taking power. The United Kingdom, in an effort to get the contract moving, offered the hulls of &quot;Ocelot&quot; and &quot;Opportune&quot;, but Canada passed on them. However, when &quot;Onyx&quot; became available, Canada took up the offer. The final price of C$40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963. However, due to Canadian modifications to the design, that number climbed to C$51.4 million.

Since &quot;Onyx&quot; was already under construction, the boat was finished to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original &quot;Oberon&quot; design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew. The three submarines were acquired for service as &quot;clockwork mice&quot;, submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.

==Construction and career==

The submarine was initially ordered for the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Onyx&quot;, with Chatham Dockyard laying the keel down on 27 September 1962. In 1963 the submarine was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, and was launched as HMCS &quot;Ojibwa&quot; on 29 February 1964. &quot;Ojibwa&quot; was commissioned on 23 September 1965 at Chatham Dockyard. The submarine was named after the Ojibwe First Nations people, and was assigned the pennant number S 72.

&quot;Ojibwa&quot; was assigned to the First Canadian Submarine Squadron on 22 April 1966, later joined by her sister boats and served virtually her entire career with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) in the North Atlantic. Following the establishment of the First Canadian Submarine Squadron, personnel issues arose aboard &quot;Ojibwa&quot; and Rear-Admiral William Landymore was forced to intervene directly, relieving the commander of the submarine, Lt. Commander Samuel G. Tomlinson. &quot;Ojibwa&quot; spent time training with the Royal Navy after an exchange program was instituted in the 1960s that would see submarines from both the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy spend time with each other&#x27;s forces. This allowed Canadian submarines on intelligence-gathering missions. Beginning in the 1970s, Canada began underwater surveillance patrols in the western Atlantic, tracking Soviet sub and surface fleet vessels, especially the ballistic missile submarines, usually in concert with an Argus or Aurora patrol aircraft. In 1977, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; made a short deployment to British Columbia with Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) in 1977. She took part in WESTEX 77, a training exercise off the west coast.

&quot;Ojibwa&quot; underwent her SOUP refit beginning in 1979, arriving at HMC Dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 18 June for preparation. The refit began on 20 February 1981 and lasted until 31 May 1982. Following the SOUP refit and the introduction of the Mark 48 torpedoes, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were considered fully operational and counted the same as other offensive fleet units in Maritime Command. From 14 November to 6 December 1983, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; performed and anti-Soviet submarine patrol for NATO. The sub made another patrol in March 1985 and discovered a Soviet . The Delta-class sub passed within of &quot;Ojibwa&quot;, which tracked the Soviets for two days. On 20 March, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; was detected by a Soviet and broke off contact with both subs.

Following the end of the Cold War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were retasked, performing patrols on behalf of federal institutions such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Solicitor General of Canada between 1991 and 1994. For six months in 1994, the submarine served on the west coast. The delay of the introduction of the &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines led to the &quot;Oberon&quot;s working past their life expectancy. In 1994, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; was cut in half; her engines were removed and replaced with newer ones from , which had been purchased from the Royal Navy as a source of spare parts in 1992. During the Turbot War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were tasked with monitoring European fishing fleets off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Their presence served as a deterrent in the escalating crisis. In 1997 &quot;Ojibwa&quot; made a second small deployment to the west coast. This deployment was rife with problems, as the submarine developed mechanical and technical difficulties. She was paid off from MARCOM on 21 May 1998.

==Museum ship==
In May 2005, the &quot;Halifax Chronicle-Herald&quot; announced that MARCOM was looking to sell &quot;Ojibwa&quot; for scrap metal, along with three other Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s. MARCOM stated that the submarines were not in suitable condition to be used as museum ships and predicted that each submarine would sell for between C$50,000 and C$60,000. After decommissioning, she was a target in &quot;shock&quot; testing in 2010 resulting in a noticeable dent on the port side.

On 11 June 2010, it was reported that &quot;Ojibwa&quot; would be moved by BMT Fleet Technology Ltd to become part of the collection of the Elgin Military Museum at St. Thomas, Ontario. On 2 December 2011, it was announced that the Department of National Defence had approved the transfer of &quot;Ojibwa&quot; to the Elgin Military Museum subject to satisfaction of financial requirements. The final agreement was signed on 25 May 2012 after three years of negotiations.

On 26 May 2012, &quot;Ojibwa&quot; started her trip from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Hamilton, Ontario by way of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The submarine was transferred with the help of the tugs &quot;Florence M&quot; and &quot;Lac Manitoba&quot; and tow &quot;HM-1&quot;. She stayed in Hamilton at Heddle Marine Dockyards being repainted and fitted with specialized transport cradles that would allow her to be moved across land. On 18 November 2012, &quot;Ojibwa&quot;, on the barge &quot;HM 08&quot;, made the final leg of her journey by way of the Welland Canal and then Lake Erie from Hamilton to Port Burwell, while being towed by the tugs &quot;Lac Manitoba&quot; and &quot;Seahound&quot;.

The sub arrived in Port Burwell on 20 November after a short journey and became part of a new Museum of Naval History. The site opened for tours on 29 June 2013. During April 2015, financial issues dealing with the transfer of the submarine to Port Burwell were widely circulated, as Royal Bank of Canada called on the community to pay the $6 million loan.

<text>HMS &quot;Onslaught&quot; was a British attack submarine operated by the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a direct follow on of the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull.

As designed for British service, the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of 2 Admiralty Standard Range 16 VMS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a , 3-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight diameter torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers, 62 sailors.

&quot;Onslaught&quot; was laid down by Chatham Dockyard on 8 April 1959, and launched on 24 September 1960. The boat was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 August 1962.

==Operational history==

&quot;Onslaught&quot; was first assigned to the 2nd Submarine Squadron, based in Devonport. She was reassigned to the Singapore-based 7th Squadron in 1966, and received a refit in Devonport from 1970 to 1972. She was then assigned to the 1st Squadron in 1972. Her squadron assignemnt after 1983 is unknown.

Her patrols in the Mediterranean and Baltic from 1986 to 1988 are classified.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Onslaught&quot; was paid off in 1990, and broken up in Aliaga, Turkey in 1991.

<text>Martinborough ( or ) is a town in the South Wairarapa District, in the Wellington region of New Zealand. It is 65 kilometres east of Wellington and 35 kilometres south-west of Masterton. The town has a resident population of 

The town is home to the South Wairarapa District Council.

==History and culture==

===European settlement===

John Martin is regarded as the town’s founder and set out the first streets in the pattern of the Union Flag in the 19th century. Before Martinborough was established the southern part of the region was known as Waihenga, a point that seems to be lost at times in the history of the district. A feature is the colonial architecture, one example of which is the historic Martinborough Hotel, built in 1882.

Prior to the expansion of viticulture, Martinborough was largely a rural service town for nearby farms.

=== Mayors of Martinborough Borough Council ===
The mayor of Martinborough officiated over the Martinborough Borough of New Zealand, which was administered by the Martinborough Borough Council. The office existed from 1928 until 1989, when Martinborough Borough alongside Greytown and Featherston boroughs also with Featherston County was amalgamated into the South Wairarapa District Council as part of the 1989 local government reforms.

===Marae===

The local Hau Ariki Marae and Te Whare Wananga o Tupai meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Kahungunu hapū of Ngāti Hikawera o Kahungunu.

In October 2020, the Government committed $371,332 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae, and create 37 jobs.

== Demographics ==
Martinborough covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Martinborough had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Martinborough had a population of 1,767 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 294 people (20.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 438 people (33.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 741 households, comprising 852 males and 915 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female. The median age was 49.3 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 288 people (16.3%) aged under 15 years, 192 (10.9%) aged 15 to 29, 840 (47.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 444 (25.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 84.9% European/Pākehā, 18.5% Māori, 3.6% Pasifika, 3.7% Asian, and 1.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 19.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 57.0% had no religion, 31.4% were Christian, 1.2% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 1.9% were Buddhist and 2.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 387 (26.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 279 (18.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $33,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 282 people (19.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 723 (48.9%) people were employed full-time, 246 (16.6%) were part-time, and 30 (2.0%) were unemployed.

==Economy==

Martinborough has a large number of vineyards producing wines, notably Pinot noir. Martinborough has a warm micro-climate, with hills to the east and west. Almost all the vineyards are in thin ribbons around the northern and eastern sides of the town, and on the Dry River to the south. All follow dry riverbeds, which provide appropriate soils for viticulture.

Notable wineries include Schubert Wines, Te Kairanga, Tirohana Estate, Palliser Estate Wines, Dry River, Martinborough Vineyard, Murdoch James, Ata Rangi, Craggy Range, and Escarpment. During November, the region&#x27;s wines are celebrated in the Toast Martinborough wine festival. This event temporarily enlarges the population by 10,000.

Other industries around Martinborough focus on traditional beef and sheep farming; growing olives, lavender and nuts; and fishing at the coast settlements of Ngawi and Cape Palliser. Tourism is an important industry for the town, and the Martinborough i-site provides advice about accommodation, activities, wineries and where to eat. Several wineries and specialist tour operators offer vineyard tours, and the Martinborough Brewery is also located in town.

== Dark Sky Reserve ==
In January 2023, an area of , was certified as the Wairarapa Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association. It was the second dark sky reserve to be certified in New Zealand (after the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve was recognised in 2012). The certification of the new dark sky reserve was the result of 5 years of volunteer work by the Wairarapa Dark Sky Reserve Association and local partner organisations. The area covered by the reserve includes the Aorangi Forest Park, and the South Wairarapa and Carterton Districts. Martinborough was the location for the first public meeting to discuss the proposal to apply for dark sky accreditation, and the town is approximately in the centre of the reserve.

==Education==

Martinborough School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

The nearest high school is Kuranui College.

The international cooking school Le Cordon Bleu and UCOL considered establishing a campus in Martinborough by 2009. They eventually opted to open a campus in Wellington instead, disappointing locals who were hoping it would provide an economic boost to the town.

<text>HMS &quot;Oberon&quot; was the lead ship of the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines, operated by the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a direct follow on of the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull.

As designed for British service, the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of 2 Admiralty Standard Range 16 VMS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a 3-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight diameter torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers, 62 sailors.

&quot;Oberon&quot; was laid down by Chatham Dockyard on 28 November 1957, and launched on 18 July 1959. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 24 February 1961. &quot;Oberon&quot; cost £2.43 million. She was the first of the class to have a deeper casing installed to house the equipment for initial training of SSN crews.

==Operational history==

<text>Lester Ben Binion (November 20, 1904 – December 25, 1989), better known as Benny Binion, was an American casino operator who established illegal gambling operations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. In 1931, Binion was convicted of shooting and killing a rumrunner, Frank Bolding. In the 1940s, he relocated to Nevada, where gambling was legal, and opened the successful Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe casino in downtown Las Vegas.

==Early history==
Benny Binion was born and raised in Pilot Grove, Texas, north of Dallas. His parents initially kept him out of school due to poor health. His father, a horse trader, let him accompany him on trips. While the outdoor life restored his health, Binion never had any formal education. As he traveled with his father, the young man learned to gamble, a favorite pastime when horse traders met up with farmers and merchants during county fair trade days.

==Criminal history==
Binion&#x27;s FBI file reveals a criminal history dating back to 1924. At age 18 he moved to El Paso, where he began moonshining during the Prohibition Era. A year later Binion moved to Dallas and continued moonshining, for which he was twice convicted. While moonshining, Binion came into contact with Warren Diamond and became a dice dealer for Diamond&#x27;s St. George Hotel casino on Commerce Street in Dallas. In addition to his moonshining, in 1928, Binion opened up an even more lucrative numbers game. 

In 1931, Binion was convicted of shooting and killing an African American rumrunner, Frank Bolding, &quot;cowboy style.&quot; This was the origin of Binion&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy&quot; nickname. He received a two-year suspended sentence. In 1936, Binion and an associate killed a numbers operator and competitor, Ben Frieden, emptying their pistols into him. Binion then allegedly shot himself in the shoulder and turned himself in to police, claiming that Frieden had shot him first. Binion was indicted, but the indictment was later dismissed on the grounds that Binion had acted in self-defense. Two years later, Binion and associates allegedly killed Sam Murray, another of his competitors in the gambling rackets. Binion was never indicted for this murder, and charges were dropped against his associates. In the same year as the murder of Frieden, Binion established a network of private dice games at several Dallas hotels, including the Southland Hotel in downtown Dallas. This came to be known as the Southland Syndicate. 

By the end of 1936, Binion had gained control of most gambling operations in Dallas, with protection from a powerful local politician. He ran a famous casino known as the &quot;Top O&#x27; Hill Terrace&quot; in Arlington, as well as a horse track. These venues, in addition to other smaller ones in Arlington, attracted celebrities from around the nation. By the early 1940s, he had become the reigning mob boss of Dallas, and was seeking to take over the gambling rackets in Fort Worth. The local mob boss of that city, Lewis Tindell, was murdered shortly afterwards.

With the 1946 election of Steve Guthrie as sheriff of Dallas County, Binion lost his fix with the local government and fled to Las Vegas, Nevada. Shortly afterward a long-running feud between Binion and Herbert Noble, a small-time Dallas gambler, boiled over when Noble refused to increase his payoff to Binion from 25 to 40 percent. Binion posted a reward on Noble&#x27;s life, which eventually reached $25,000 and control of a Dallas crap game. Noble survived numerous murder attempts, sometimes narrowly escaping with gunshot wounds. In November 1949, his wife was killed in a car bombing intended for him. In retaliation, Noble planned to fly his private plane to Las Vegas to bomb Binion&#x27;s house, but was restrained by local law enforcement before he could execute his plan. In August 1951, as Noble drove up to his mailbox, a bomb exploded nearby, killing him instantly.

Binion lost his Nevada gaming license in 1951 and was sentenced to a five-year term in 1953 at Leavenworth federal penitentiary for tax evasion.

==Casino years==

In Las Vegas, Binion became a partner of the Las Vegas Club casino, but left after a year due to licensing problems. In 1949, he opened the Westerner Gambling House and Saloon, but he soon sold out after conflicts with his casino partners.

In 1951, Binion purchased the Eldorado Club and the Apache Hotel, opening them as Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe, which immediately became popular because of the high limits on bets. He initially set a table limit of $500 for craps. As a result of outdoing the competition he received death threats, although eventually casinos raised their limits to keep up with him. Additionally, the Horseshoe would allow a bet of any size from a player, as long as the player&#x27;s subsequent bets were no larger than the player&#x27;s initial bet.

Binion was in the vanguard of Las Vegas casino innovation. He was the first in the downtown Glitter Gulch to replace sawdust-covered floors with carpeting, the first to dispatch limousines to transport customers to and from the casino, and the first to offer free drinks to players. Although comps were standard for high rollers, Binion gave them to all players. He also shied away from the gaudy performing acts typical of other Las Vegas casinos.

Binion was known to be generous to patrons, and said he followed a simple philosophy when serving his customers: &quot;Good food, good whiskey cheap, and a good gamble.&quot; For many years, the Horseshoe had a late night $2 steak special, with most of the meat for the steaks coming from cattle on Binion&#x27;s ranches in Montana. The Horseshoe is also believed to be the first major casino to offer 100-times-odds at craps (a patron with a bet on the pass or don&#x27;t-pass lines could take or lay up to 100 times their bet in odds). It was one of the more profitable casinos in town.

After his trial and conviction in 1953, to cover back taxes and legal costs, Binion sold a majority share in the Horseshoe to fellow gambler and New Orleans oilman Joe W. Brown. Binion&#x27;s family regained controlling interest in the Horseshoe in 1957, but did not regain full control until 1964. Binion was never allowed to hold a gaming license afterwards. Instead, his son Jack became the licensee, with Benny assuming the title of Director of Public Relations.

Binion styled himself a cowboy throughout his life. He almost never wore a necktie and used gold coins as buttons on his cowboy shirts. Despite being technically barred from owning guns, he carried at least one pistol all his life and kept a sawed-off shotgun close by. His office was a booth in the downstairs restaurant, and he knew many of his customers by name.

== Poker ==
Binion didn&#x27;t consider himself to be very good at poker, nor did he participate much in competition or private cash games, preferring to organize them. However, in 1990 he was inducted posthumously into the Poker Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game.

==Family==
Binion and his wife, Teddy Jane, had five children: two sons, Jack and Ted, and three daughters. Jack and Ted took over as president and casino manager, respectively, in 1964. Benny&#x27;s wife, Teddy Jane, managed the casino cage until her death in 1994. In 1998, Binion&#x27;s daughter, Becky, took over the presidency after a legal battle, and Jack moved on to other gambling interests. Becky&#x27;s presidency saw the casino sink into debt. In 2004, federal agents seized $1 million from the Horseshoe&#x27;s bankroll to satisfy unpaid union benefits, forcing its closure and eventual sale to Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment. It now operates as Binion&#x27;s Gambling Hall and Hotel under the ownership of TLC Gaming Group.

Benny Binion&#x27;s son, Ted Binion, was under scrutiny from the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1986 onwards for his involvement in drugs and associating with organized crime figures. Ted&#x27;s gaming license was revoked in 1989, and he died in mysterious circumstances about a decade later. Ted&#x27;s live-in girlfriend, Sandra Murphy, and her lover, Rick Tabish, were charged and convicted of murdering Ted, but the verdict was later overturned. They were retried and acquitted.

Ted Binion had a collection of silver coins that he buried on one of his properties. He collected 135,000 silver dollars and stored them in an underground safe in Pahrump, Nevada. The collection was known as the Binion Hoard. After Ted&#x27;s death there were several arrests of individuals who tried to steal the silver.

==Legacy==

In January 1949, Benny Binion arranged for Johnny Moss and Nick &quot;The Greek&quot; Dandolos to play a head-to-head poker tournament which ended up lasting five months, with Dandolos ultimately losing a reported two million dollars. The 42-year-old Moss had to take breaks to sleep occasionally, during which Dandalos, then aged 57, went over to the craps table and played. After the final hand, and losing millions of dollars, Dandolos uttered one of the most famous poker quotes of all time: &quot;Mr. Moss, I have to let you go.&quot; (This narrative is disputed as fact and is most likely a myth. Binion didn&#x27;t operate a casino until 1951 in Las Vegas.)

In 1970, after years of arranging heads-up matches between high-stakes players, Binion invited six players to compete in a tournament. Playing no-limit Texas Hold&#x27;em, the players competed for cash at the table and later took a vote on who was to be named champion. Moss, then aged 63, was voted champion by his younger competition and received a small trophy. The following year, a freeze-out format was introduced with a $10,000 buy-in, and the World Series of Poker was born. Binion&#x27;s creation of the World Series helped popularize the game of poker, though he greatly underestimated how popular the World Series would become. In 1973, he speculated that eventually the tournament might have fifty or so entrants. However, by 2006, the tournament&#x27;s main event (not including all of the other events) would have 8,773 entrants.

Binion never forgot his Texas roots and was a key player in getting the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) to move to Las Vegas. He never forgot the cowboys after they arrived; he always paid the entry fees for all of the cowboys for their championship event. When the casino closed, Boyd Gaming took up the tradition that Binion started by continuing to pay all the entry fees. Every year during the NFR there is a large rodeo stock auction called &quot;Benny Binion&#x27;s World Famous Bucking Horse and Bull Sale.&quot;

Binion was also the owner of a horse named &quot;Nigger&quot; (later referred to as &quot;Benny Binion&#x27;s Gelding&quot;) who was the 1946, 1947, and 1948 National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) World Champion. Bred by Binion, ridden and trained by George Glascock, the solid black 15 hand gelding is the only horse to capture the NCHA World Championship three years in a row.

==Death==
Binion died of heart failure at the age of 85 on December 25, 1989, in Las Vegas. Poker great &quot;Amarillo Slim&quot; Preston suggested as an epitaph, &quot;He was either the gentlest bad guy or the baddest good guy you&#x27;d ever seen.&quot;

<doc id="979619" wikidata="Q2739066" url="?curid=979619" title="Britannia Row Studios">
<text>Britannia Row Studios was a recording studio in Islington, London N1 (1975–1995), and then Fulham, London SW6, England (1995–2015). It was built by the English rock band Pink Floyd, who used it to record their albums &quot;Animals&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979). 

==History==
The studio was built by the English rock band Pink Floyd in a three-story block at 35 Britannia Row, Islington, London N1, after their 1975 album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was released. Pink Floyd used the studio to record their album &quot;Animals&quot; and parts of &quot;The Wall,&quot; including the school chorus on &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s drummer, Nick Mason, eventually assumed ownership of the studio. In the early 1990s, he sold the business to Kate Koumi, who had been managing it since the mid-1980s. Koumi relocated it in 1995 to Wandsworth Bridge Road in Fulham, where it operated for the next 20 years. It closed in September 2015 and was converted into flats.

Mason retained the building in Britannia Row, which was developed as serviced offices. In 2012 some of it, including the original studio spaces, was being used as a training facility for the London School of Sound. In 2016, Islington Council granted permission for an extension and conversion of the building into flats with limited office space.
==Britannia Row Productions==
An audio equipment rental company, Britannia Row Productions, originally based at Britannia Row, was created to hire out Pink Floyd&#x27;s tour equipment and keep the skills of its crew together. Early events that it provided sound for included Queen&#x27;s 1976 show in Hyde Park, with an audience of over 150,000. Pink Floyd sold Britannia Row Productions to their managers in 1985, and it is now based in Twickenham.

<text>Niall Williams is an Irish writer. 

He has written novels, plays and non-fiction. His work has been translated into twenty different languages.

== Biography ==
Williams was born in Dublin, Ireland on June 8, 1958. While there was not an endless supply of books in the family home, his father, keen for Williams to excel academically, would take Williams to Pembroke Library every two weeks where he was spoiled for choice. He attended Oatlands College, a boys’ school in Stillorgan, County Dublin. He studied English and French Literature at University College Dublin, where he met his wife, American writer and editor Christine Breen. He graduated with a Masters of Arts in Modern American literature in 1980. 

His first published story was printed in The Irish Press when he was eighteen. A £25 cheque for his first story, and a nod of approval, was the confirmation he needed from the world to dedicate his life to writing. 

After a year lecturing at the Université de Caen in Normandy, he moved to New York. He worked briefly at Fox and Sutherland’s bookstore in Mount Kisco, New York, near his wife’s home town of Katonah before becoming a copywriter at Avon Books.

In 1985, Williams returned to Ireland and moved to Kilmihil, County Clare. He and Christine began writing factual accounts of life in rural Ireland.

== Writing career ==

=== Non-fiction and drama ===
His first four books were non-fiction chronicles of rural life in County Clare in the decade prior to the Celtic Tiger, co-written with Breen.

In 1991, Williams’ first play, &quot;The Murphy Initiative,&quot; was staged at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. His second play, &quot;A Little Like Paradise,&quot; was produced on the Peacock stage of the Abbey Theatre in 1995. His third play, &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; was produced by Galway’s Druid Theatre Company in 1999.

=== Early novels ===
&quot;Four Letters of Love&quot;, Williams&#x27; first novel, was published in 1997. It went on to become an international bestseller and has been published in more than twenty countries.

&quot;The Fall of Light&quot; was set in the nineteen century and was Williams’ first foray into historical fiction. 

=== Expanse into different styles ===
In 2006, Williams’ published his novella, The Unrequited. He also wrote two young adult novels, Boy in the World (2007) and Boy and Man (2008). 

=== Faha novels ===
In 2014, Williams started a series of novels set in Faha, a village in the west of Ireland. Similar to Macondo in the works of Gabriel García Márquez, Faha is a village steeped in magic realism which acts as a backdrop for Williams’ stories.

<doc id="979633" wikidata="Q2455570" url="?curid=979633" title="Tony McCarroll">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; McCarroll (born 4 June 1971) is an English drummer and one of the founding members of the English rock band Oasis, as their drummer from 1991 until his dismissal in April 1995. He played the drums on their debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, in addition to performing on the singles &quot;Whatever&quot; and &quot;Some Might Say&quot;, the latter of which was Oasis&#x27;s first number-one single from the album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;.

==Early life==
Anthony McCarroll was born to Irish parents, Anthony McCarroll, a native of County Tyrone and Bridie O&#x27;Donnell, a native of County Offaly, on 4 June 1971 in Levenshulme, Manchester, where he grew up. He has family in Ireland and spent a couple of years living in Kinnitty, County Offaly, his mother&#x27;s home when he was younger due to his father&#x27;s work, getting his first drum kit when he was six years old.

==Career==
===Oasis===
McCarroll had met Paul McGuigan while playing for the local football team at a young age. Together with McGuigan&#x27;s friend Paul Arthurs, they formed a band called The Rain and hired Chris Hutton as their singer, but he was sacked and replaced by Liam Gallagher not so long after, whom McCarroll had also known through childhood. Liam decided to change the name to Oasis, inspired by a poster for Inspiral Carpets that was hanging in his room.

Soon after, Liam&#x27;s brother Noel joined. McCarroll has stated in his book that he was closely involved in the creation of several of Oasis&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Supersonic&quot;, despite Gallagher being given sole credit as songwriter.

Noel Gallagher and McCarroll got on during childhood, but as Oasis gradually became famous, the relationship between the two faltered. Gallagher has repeatedly publicly slammed McCarroll&#x27;s drumming ability, saying it was not good enough for a number one single. After McCarroll&#x27;s ejection from the band, Noel Gallagher stated in an interview with the Associated Press, &quot;I like Tony as a geezer, but he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to drum the new songs.&quot;

On the last day of April 1995, McCarroll&#x27;s departure was announced and he was replaced by Alan White, who remained until 2004.

Oasis producer Owen Morris said of McCarroll, &quot;Tony was quiet and always polite to me, but seemed out of his depth…so I think Tony did well to survive as long as he did in Oasis&quot;. Morris described McCarroll&#x27;s drumming style as &quot;extremely basic&quot;, but with timing and tempo that were &quot;almost autistically perfect&quot;.

===Lawsuit against the band===
In 1999 McCarroll hired a solicitor Jens Hills – who had won Pete Best £2 million from the Beatles in 1995 – to sue Oasis for £18 million. Arguing that McCarroll was owed his part of the band&#x27;s five-album deal with Creation, the case hoped to set a legal precedent, as McCarroll would have claimed compensation for two LPs on which he had not played. Eventually, he accepted an out-of-court settlement of £550,000 in March 1999 and agreed to give up future royalties.

===Life after Oasis===
In an article building up to Oasis&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; in &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 2008, it was revealed that McCarroll was last seen in 2000 performing with the band Raika.

McCarroll&#x27;s memoir of his time in Oasis, titled &quot;Oasis: The Truth&quot;, was released in October 2010.

McCarroll was also interviewed for the documentary entitled &quot;&quot; in 2016, and the audio was included in the film.

In 2022, McCarroll revealed that the only Oasis concert he ever attended as part of the crowd was coincidentally the last show they ever played: V Festival on 22 August 2009.

==Personal life==
On 30 August 2021, McCarroll revealed via Twitter that he had been admitted to hospital five days prior after suffering a heart attack, but stated that while he was &quot;not out of the woods yet&quot;, his recovery was progressing well and thanked the NHS staff for their services. The following day, McCarroll tweeted that he was &quot;all good&quot; and had left hospital after having had a coronary stent inserted to restore and improve his cardiac blood flow.

<text>The Triumph Spitfire is a British sports car manufactured over five production iterations between 1962 and 1980. Styled for Standard-Triumph in 1957 by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti, the Spitfire was introduced at the London Motor Show in 1962. It was manufactured at the Standard-Triumph Canley works, with approximately 315,000 produced over 18 years.

Developed on a shortened variant of the Triumph Herald saloon&#x27;s chassis, the Spitfire shared the Herald&#x27;s running gear and Standard SC engine. The design used body-on-frame construction, augmented by structural components within the bodywork and rear trailing arms attached to the body rather than the chassis. A manually deployable convertible top, substantially improved on later models, provided weather protection and a bespoke hard-top was available as a factory option.

The model was named after the famed Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane of World War II.

==Generations==
The Spitfire evolved over five iterations:
==Origins==
The Spitfire was conceived of by Standard-Triumph to compete in the small sports car market against the Austin-Healey Sprite. The Sprite used the drive train of the Austin A30/A35 in a new lightweight body, while the Spitfire used mechanicals from the Herald saloon. Where the Austin A30 used unitary construction, the Herald used a separate backbone chassis — which Triumph was able to downsize, saving the cost of developing a completely new chassis-body unit.

Giovanni Michelotti, who had designed the Herald, styled the bodywork, which featured wind-down windows (in contrast to the Sprite and Midget, which used side curtains) and a cowl composed of the bonnet and wings that opened forward for engine access. The Spitfire&#x27;s introduction was delayed by its company&#x27;s financial troubles in the early 1960&#x27;s and was subsequently announced shortly after Standard Triumph was taken over by Leyland Motors. While taking stock of their new acquisition, Leyland officials found Michelotti&#x27;s prototype under a dust sheet in a factory corner, and quickly approved it for production.

==Spitfire 4 or Mark I (1962–1964)==

The production design changed little from the prototype: the full-width rear bumper was replaced by two part-bumpers curving around each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals derived from the Herald saloon/sedan, with the notable addition of front disc brakes. Bodywork was bolted to the much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; with structural outer sills to stiffen the overall design.

The engine was an four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, using twin SU carburettors. The Herald&#x27;s rack and pinion steering and coil-and-wishbone front suspension carried over, having derived from systems used by the former Alford &amp; Alder company that had been acquired by Standard-Triumph in 1959.

Rear suspension was by a single transverse-leaf swing axle, an arrangement, that unless ameliorated by any of several options, can allow rear tyres to undergo large camber changes during fast cornering, leading to oversteer – a dynamically unstable condition in which a vehicle can lose control and spin. As did many manufacturers who used a swing axle arrangement (e.g., Mercedes, Renault, Volkswagen), Triumph would later modify the rear suspension. In 1970, the rear suspension was decambered, by incorporating what Triumph called a &quot;swing spring&quot;. One leaf was eliminated from the stack and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leaves were mounted to pivot freely — thereby eliminating the worst characteristics of the original swing-axle design.

The Spitfire was an inexpensive small sports car and as such received rather basic trim by today&#x27;s standards, including rubber mats and a large plastic steering wheel. It was nonetheless considered fairly comfortable at the time, as it had wind-down windows and exterior door locks, as well as relatively full instrumentation. These early cars were referred to both as &quot;Triumph Spitfire Mark Is&quot; and &quot;Spitfire 4s&quot;, different from the later Spitfire Mark IV. The &quot;Spitfire 4&quot; name indicated the possibility of the appearance of a six-cylinder version.

In UK specification the inline four produced at 5,750 rpm, and of torque at 3,500 rpm. This gave a top speed of , and a 0 to acceleration in 16.4 seconds. Average fuel consumption was 31 mpg.

For 1964 an overdrive became optional to the four-speed manual gearbox. Wire wheels and a hard top were also available.
==Spitfire Mark II (1965–1967)==

In March 1965 the Spitfire Mark II launched with a retuned engine, featuring a revised camshaft profile, water-heated intake manifold, and tubular exhaust manifold, increasing power to at 6,000 rpm. The coil-spring design clutch of the Mark I was replaced with a Borg &amp; Beck diaphragm spring clutch; North American models retained the coil-spring housing and were also equipped with ACDelco distributors. Exterior trim featured a new grille and badges, and the interior featured revised seats, covering most exposed surfaces with rubber cloth. Carpeting replaced the original moulded rubber floor mats.

Its base price was £550; the Austin-Healey Sprite&#x27;s was £505 and the MG Midget&#x27;s £515. Top speed was claimed to be and its 0–60 mph time of 14.8 seconds was considered &quot;lively&quot;. The factory claimed that at highway speeds () the car achieved .

==Spitfire Mark III (1967–1970)==

The Mark III, introduced in March 1967, was the first major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, and the front coil springs were slightly raised. Slightly revised bonnet pressings were carried over. Rear overriders were deleted and bumper mounted reversing lights became standard (initially as two separate lights on either side of the number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate). The interior received a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller, 15-inch, wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier, more complicated design. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster remained centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II), easily accommodating right-hand and left-hand drive versions.

The 1,147 cc engine was replaced with a bored-out 1,296 cc unit (the bore increasing from to , stroke retained at ), as fitted on the new Triumph Herald 13/60 and Triumph 1300 saloons. A new quieter exhaust gave a sweet distinct note and reduced cabin noise. In SU twin-carburettor form, the engine put out a claimed at 6,000 rpm, and of torque at 4,000 rpm, and made the Mark III a comparatively quick car by the standards of the day. Options included wire wheels, factory hard top and a Laycock de Normanville overdrive. The Mark III was the fastest Spitfire yet, achieving in 13.4 seconds, and reaching a top speed of . Average fuel consumption was 33mpg. The Mark III continued production into 1971, well after introduction of the Mark IV.

On 8 February 1968, Standard-Triumph general manager George Turnbull drove the 100,000th Triumph Spitfire off the Canley production line. More than 75% of this number had been exported outside the UK, including 45% to the US and 25% to mainland European markets.

The 1968 model featured dual system (aka tandem) brakes with a brake failure warning device. The engine used a revised camshaft and a distributor with idle speed ignition timing retarded to address emissions. The twin SU carburettors now included overrun valves in the throttle discs and anti-tampering features on carburettor fuel-air mixture nuts.

Starting in 1969, US-bound models were &quot;federalised&quot; to comply with safety and emissions regulations. A reduced compression ratio of 8.5:1 resulted in a slight decrease in power (68 bhp) and 73 ft-lbs of torque. However, the 0–60 time of 14 seconds was still faster than the Mark II. The instrument panel was moved in front of the driver, and new seats were introduced with integrated headrests to help against whiplash. Cosmetically, the wood dash was replaced with a matte black finished assembly intended to imitate an aircraft cockpit.

The Mark III&#x27;s final production year (1970) included an integrated rear reverse and license plate lamp, side lamps at the front and rear and new badging. The separate &quot;Triumph&quot; letters on the front of the bonnet were removed and &quot;Triumph&quot; and &quot;Spitfire&quot; rectangular badges were used in the front, rear sides and rear. A limited number of U.S. market 1970s were adorned with an RAF style &quot;Spitfire&quot; badge (U.K. models had a plain badge without the RAF roundel) that rested in the right corner (car opposing point of view) of the bonnet. Additional exterior changes introduced included a zip up rear window, black radiator grille and a black (vs body coloured) windscreen surround. Full wheel covers of two styles were used including the 1969 introduced model with &quot;SPITFIRE&quot; circumscribing the hub and a unique derivative without the branding. Interior changes included a steering column mounted ignition switch, a key-in-ignition warning buzzer, driver&#x27;s side under-dash courtesy lamp and a new black spoked steering wheel. Under the bonnet, some markets had the twin SU carburettors replaced with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor.
==Spitfire Mark IV (1970–1974)==

The Mark IV featured a redesigned rear, similar to the Triumph Stag and Triumph 2000 models, both also designed by Michelotti. The front end was revised with a new bonnet pressing, eliminating the weld lines on top of the wings, door handles were recessed, the convertible top received squared-off corners. The interior was revised to include a full-width dashboard, with instruments ahead of the driver rather than over the centre console, initially finished in black plastic and then from 1973 finished in wood.

The engine was now rated at 63 horsepower for the UK market, with a 9:1 compression ratio and twin SU HS2 carburettors. (The less powerful North American version continued to use a single Zenith Stromberg carburettor and an 8.5:1 compression ratio) due to the German DIN system; the output was the same for the early Mark IV. Performance was slower than the Mark III due to its weight increase and taller 3.89:1 final drive as opposed to the earlier 4.11:1.

The Mk. IV engine displaced throughout the production run, and in 1973 received larger big-end bearings to rationalise production with the TR6 2.5-litre engines. The engine was also detuned to meet new emissions regulations. With the overall weight also increasing to performance dropped, with now in 15.8 seconds and top speed reduced to . Fuel economy was . 

A revised hardtop also became available, with rear quarter-lights and a flatter rear screen.

Importantly, the heavily criticised rear suspension was decambered, incorporating what Triumph called a &quot;swing spring&quot;. One leaf of the suspension &quot;stack&quot; was eliminated and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leaves were mounted to pivot freely — eliminating the worst characteristics of the original swing-axle. This was a different approach than that taken with the Triumph GT6 Mk II (GT6+) and Triumph Vitesse Mark 2, both of which received new lower wishbones and Rotoflex half-shaft couplings. The result on all these cars was improved handling.

The Mark IV went on sale in the UK at the end of 1970 with a base price of £735.
==Spitfire 1500 (1974–1980)==

In 1973 in the United States and Canada, and 1975 in the rest of the world, the 1500 engine was used on the MK IV body to make the Spitfire 1500. Although in this final incarnation the engine was rather rough and more prone to failure than the earlier units, torque was greatly increased by increasing the cylinder stroke to , which made it much more drivable in traffic.

While the rest of the world saw 1500s with a compression ratio of 8.0:1, the American market model was fitted with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor and a compression ratio reduced to 7.5:1 to allow it to run on lower octane unleaded fuel. With the addition of a catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculating system, the engine only delivered (DIN) with a slower 0–60 mph time of 16.3 seconds. The notable exception to this was the 1976 model year, where the compression ratio was raised to 9.1:1. This improvement was short-lived, however, as the ratio was again reduced to 7.5:1 for the remaining years of production.

In the UK the 9:1 compression ratio, less restrictive emissions control equipment, and the Type HS2 SU carburettors now being replaced with larger Type HS4 models, led to the most powerful variant to date. The 1500 Spitfire now produced 71 hp (DIN) at 5,500 rpm, and produced of torque at 3,000 rpm. Top speed was now at the mark, and 0 to was reached in 13.2 seconds. Fuel economy was reduced to 29mpg.

Further improvements to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer swing axles and a lowered spring mounting point for more negative camber and a wider rear track. The wider, lower stance gave an impressive skid pad result of 0.87g average. The gearbox gained synchromesh on its bottom gear.
The American market Spitfire 1500 is identified by large plastic over-riders and wing mounted reflectors on the front and back wings. US specification models up to 1978 featured chrome bumpers, and on the 1979 and 1980 models these were replaced by black rubber bumpers with built-in over-riders, using chassis extensions to support the bumpers.

Detail improvements continued to be made throughout the 1500&#x27;s production run, including reclining seats with &quot;chequered brushed nylon centre panels&quot; and head restraints, introduced for domestic market cars early in 1977 along with a new set of column stalk operated minor controls (as fitted already in the TR7) replacing the old dashboard mounted knobs and switches. Also added for the model&#x27;s final years were a wood dash, hazard flashers and an electric screen washer, in place of the previous manual pump operated ones. Options such as the hard top, tonneau cover, map light and overdrive continued to be popular, but wire wheels ceased to be available.

The 1980 model was the last and the heaviest Spitfire, weighing . Base prices for the 1980 model year were $7,365 in the US and £3,631 in the UK.

Assembled at Canley in August 1980 shortly before the factory closed, the last Spitfire was an &quot;Inca Yellow&quot; UK-model including the factory hardtop and overdrive options. Never sold to the public, it remains on display at the British Motor Museum.
==Motorsports==
Popular in street and rally racing, Spitfires won numerous SCCA National Sports Car Championships in F and G Production classes; won its class at the 1964 Tour de France rally, coming in second overall, and won the 1964 Geneva Rally. In 1965, a Spitfire won its class in the Alpine Rally.

<text>Capital XTRA (formerly Choice FM) is a British digital radio station owned and operated by Global. It broadcasts on 96.9 and 107.1 FM in Greater London, and nationally on DAB, Global Player and television platforms. It specialises in hip hop, grime and R&amp;B music, and is a commercial competitor to BBC Radio 1Xtra.

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.7 million listeners, according to RAJAR.

==History==

===Choice 96.9===
Choice 96.9 began as an independent company in March 1990, broadcasting from studios in Trinity Gardens, Brixton. It was Britain’s first 24-hour black music radio station with a licence, covering South London. The group won a second licence (see Buzz FM) in 1995, bringing a local version of their London offering to Birmingham, on 102.2 FM - in place of Buzz FM.

The advent of digital radio in the UK saw Choice, which already had an active webstream, joining the new MXR consortium and launching a DAB service which anchored London output with news inserts produced by the consortium&#x27;s news service DNN.

The Birmingham licence was sold to Chrysalis Radio in 1999 and became Galaxy Birmingham, but Choice expanded within the capital in May 2000 when a largely independent North London licence was awarded for Choice 107.1, with the intention of reaching a larger Afro-Caribbean audience outside the limited range of the coverage from Brixton. The station was now broadcasting from Borough High Street, Borough, London.

Having previously been a minority shareholder, Capital Radio Group took full control of the station in February 2004 and moved the station&#x27;s base from the target service area to the group&#x27;s central studios in London&#x27;s Leicester Square. The move resulted in a community march from the coverage area and their studios. It was accused of selling out as some of their DJs were removed and replaced by their Kiss counterparts who play some electronic music.

By 12 October 2004, Capital had received and implemented a merger of their FM licences, operating a service across the capital on the two frequencies and cutting back on the North London-specific music requirements.

The DAB service also became a simulcast of the London station, with the demise of local drop-ins.

Following their takeover of Choice, Capital Radio Group merged with GWR to form GCap Media in 2005. Choice was flagged up as one of the key brands of the new larger network, and the station was made available to digital TV viewers via its addition to Sky (and later to Virgin Media).

GCap were subsequently taken over by Global Radio, who already owned the Galaxy Network of dance/urban music stations. Despite the separate music format and branding, Choice was marketed to advertisers as part of the Galaxy network for package advertising deals. In 2010 Global Radio announced that the Galaxy network stations would be networked with 95.8 Capital FM, leaving Choice as a standalone brand again.

===Capital XTRA===

On 3 October 2013, Global announced that Choice would be rebranded as Capital XTRA on 7 October, sister station to Capital and using a naming scheme in reference to BBC Radio 1 and its sister station Radio 1Xtra 

A number of high-profile signings were made, at launch including former BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Tim Westwood, and subsequently Kiss FM DJ Jez Welham for the station&#x27;s flagship show, Capital XTRA In The Morning.

Initially, the station introduced dance music alongside the urban offering provided by Choice FM. However, ratings, particularly in London, suffered, leading to a move back towards the mixture of primarily black music genres that is now heard on the station, which proved successful between 2014 and 2020 in the UK radio listening measurement system, RAJAR.

Capital XTRA refreshed its weekend schedule at the start of 2018, hiring Afrobeats artist and DJ Afro B to host the Afrobeats show previously hosted by DJ Abrantee, and student radio winner Robert Bruce for a new UK-music led programme, &#x27;Homegrown&#x27;. In a coup for the station, legendary hip-hop presenter DJ Semtex moved from BBC Radio 1Xtra to host the same slot on Capital XTRA in October 2018.

In September 2019, a new weekday Breakfast show was launched, hosted by former evening presenter Yinka Bokinni, and Shayna-Marie Birch-Campbell.

On 5 August 2022, Capital XTRA confirmed that Yinka Bokinni had quit the station. Evening show host Robert Bruce was subsequently confirmed to co-host the breakfast slot with incumbent presenter Shayna-Marie. Omah Howard replaced Robert Bruce on the evening show. 

On 1 September 2023, Manny Norte announced he would step down his mid morning weekday show to focus on his weekend shows with immediate effect. He presented the weekday slot for over 10 years. 

On 2 September 2023, Remel London announced she would leave the station. A replacement is to be announced.

===Capital XTRA Reloaded===
A spin-off station, Capital XTRA Reloaded, was launched on 2 September 2019. It featured former Galaxy Birmingham presenter Sacha Brooks as host of the station&#x27;s flagship show. Available nationally on DAB+, the station plays non-stop old skool hip-hop and R&amp;B anthems.

===Listening figures===
Having launched with 850,000 listeners, Capital XTRA reached a peak of 1.9 million listeners across the UK in 2019. Following management changes in 2020, listenership dropped to an estimated 1.3 million people. As of June 2023, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.4 million, according to RAJAR.

==Programming==
At Capital XTRA&#x27;s peak, thematic programming included &#x27;Reloaded&#x27;, a daily hour of uninterrupted old-skool Hip-Hop and R&amp;B anthems, &quot;Homegrown&quot;, a focus on emerging UK talent including interviews and guest mixes, and &quot;Chilled&quot;, a slow-jamz segment on weeknights and Sunday mornings. Since listening figures began falling in 2021, the majority of such programming has been axed, with output favouring a hegemonic playlist.

== Current presenters==
Current presenters include:
===Weekdays===
*Toni Phillips
* DJ Semtex

===Weekends===
* Afro B
* Ras Kwame
* Zeze Millz

==Events==

Between 2016 and 2020, Capital XTRA hosted a number of events to complement its radio broadcasts, including:

*Homegrown Live; an artist-led event which featured performances from UK talent at Koko, Camden. Previous performers include AJ Tracey, Aitch, Dappy, Hardy Caprio, Stefflon Don and WSTRN.
