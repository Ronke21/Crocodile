<text>Steinbach () is the third-largest city in the province of Manitoba, Canada, and with a population of 17,806, the largest community in the Eastman region. The city, located about southeast of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Hanover to the north, west, and south, and the Rural Municipality of La Broquerie to the east. Steinbach was first settled by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Ukraine in 1874, whose descendants continue to have a significant presence in the city today. Steinbach is found on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies, while Sandilands Provincial Forest is a short distance east of the city.

Steinbach&#x27;s economy has traditionally been focused around agriculture; however, as the regional economic hub of southeastern Manitoba, Steinbach now has a trading area population of about 50,000 people and significant employment in the financial services industry, automobile sales, tourism, retail, and manufacturing. The city had a population growth of 11.1% between 2016 and 2021 and has gained national recognition as an immigration destination of Canada and a model for immigrant integration in the country.

==Etymology==
Steinbach means &quot;Stony Brook&quot; in German.
Steinbach&#x27;s stony brook was drained sometime after settlement. Low German-Mennonites named the town Steinbach in 1874, after a village also called Steinbach in Borosenko colony, Ukraine.

==History==
===Treaty 1 and the East Reserve===
After the Assiniboine and Cree First Nations left the region in the 1820s, the Anishinabe hunted in and moved seasonally through the area on their way to the burial grounds in the Whiteshell. A bison trail ran alongside the Steinbach Creek on the far eastern edge of the Canadian prairies, a trail that was used by First Nations people for a number of years after settlement. In 1871, the Imperial Crown of Great Britain and Ireland and Anishinabe people signed Treaty 1, after which time the Canadian government began recruiting European farmers to the region, establishing the English and Scottish settlement of Clear Springs in 1872, just north of the present day location of Steinbach, and partially contained within the modern city limits. At the time of English and Scottish settlement, the nearest settled area was 17 km north in Ste. Anne, Manitoba, a Métis village founded 17 years earlier in 1856.

In 1873, the Canadian government sent William Hespeler to recruit Mennonites to move to the area. By the 1870s, some Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites in Ukraine became dissatisfied with increasing Russification and the removal of their military exemption and were persuaded by Hespeler to investigate Manitoba as a possibility for relocation. These Mennonite communities were not ethnically Russian, but had Dutch ancestry dating back to 16th century Friesland and Flanders, after which time they lived in Prussia for two centuries and then the Russian Empire where they became known as Russian Mennonites, a misnomer given that they were ethnically Dutch.

In 1873, the Mennonites sent delegates to North America to investigate and negotiate terms of immigration. After touring a number of locations in North America, many of the delegates decided to move their people to Kansas, however, the more conservative groups were persuaded to settle in the new Canadian province of Manitoba, because the Canadian government was more generous in their guarantees of religious freedom. In 1873, a Privilegium was signed between the Mennonite delegates and the Canadian government, and a year later Mennonites started to arrive in the region. The document guaranteed, among other things, military exemption, freedom of religion, private schools, and land, known as the East Reserve. In the year following the signing of the Privilegium, Mennonites from the Bergthaler and Kleine Gemeinde groups immigrated to Manitoba, aided by Ontario Mennonite Jacob Yost Shantz, and founded dozens of villages in the East Reserve.

===Early history (1874–1909)===
Steinbach&#x27;s original 18 Mennonite settler families were almost entirely of the new Kleine Gemeinde sect of Mennonites, a small conservative minority known for being gifted farmers. They left the Borosenko colony (a newly-formed offshoot of the larger Molotschna (or Milk River) colony) in Ukraine and arrived in Canada late in the summer of 1874.

Aided by their Métis neighbours, the families disembarked on the far west side of the reserve at the forks of the Rat and Red Rivers, near present-day Niverville. As they moved east across the reserve, they found that much of the better land in the reserve had already been settled a few months earlier by the Bergthaler and earlier Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. Steinbach&#x27;s settlers chose the best land that was available to them, which was in the very northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the creek, where they founded the village of Steinbach, taking the name &quot;Steinbach&quot; from the village where they lived in Borosenko.

Contrary to the preferences of the Canadian government, the early settlers of Steinbach, like other Mennonite villages, organized the village into a Strassendorf, or street village, with each family occupying a long narrow strip known as a &quot;Wirtschaft&quot;. In the first year they built temporary shelters known as semlin, before building more permanent housebarns. Most of the settlers were farmers, but in a somewhat urban setting, and lived, to some degree, communally, and shared a common pasture at the end of the village. They started a school in the first year, and in the following year of 1875 built a school and teacherage. Steinbach&#x27;s Main Street was hacked out of thick poplar bush along the creek, where a bison trail ran, a trail that was still used by Indigenous people during Steinbach&#x27;s early years.

In June 1875, Steinbach&#x27;s spiritual leader Rev. Jakob Barkman, who had led the Kleine Gemeinde to Canada, drowned in the Red River, along with Jakob K. Friesen on a trip to Winnipeg for supplies. This left the community without religious leadership for some time.

After a plague of grasshoppers destroyed the crops in 1876, residents of Steinbach met in Blumenort to discuss the possibility of migrating to Minnesota or Nebraska. However, 60-year-old matriarch Elizabeth Rempel Reimer persuaded the group to stay in Steinbach, a stirring and historically significant speech which signified the important role of women in the community and resulted in Steinbach&#x27;s continued survival as a community, unlike dozens of other East Reserve villages which have since disappeared.

In 1877, Lord Dufferin toured Manitoba&#x27;s new Mennonite settlements and stopped just west of Steinbach where he could see &quot;half a dozen villages&quot; in the distance. A crowd of 1000 people greeted his arrival. That same year, the first windmill in the town was built by Abraham S. Friesen.

The death of Rev. Barkman left Steinbach without religious leadership for a number of years, creating a vacuum that made the villagers receptive to John Holdeman when he visited in 1881. After Holdeman&#x27;s visit, many locals from the Kleine Gemeinde joined his new church, Church of God in Christ, Mennonite. This was the first of many schisms and revivals in Steinbach and eventually the town would be known for having dozens of churches, many of them different variations of Mennonite, a dynamic that has shaped the city&#x27;s character. After a period of eight years, in 1882, Mayor Gerhard Giesbrecht said that the village had grown to 28 families with a population of 128.

Various epidemics swept the area in the late 1800s, including scarlet fever, whooping cough, and diphtheria. In the spring of 1884 alone, more than seventy people died, mostly children. Another whooping cough epidemic took place in 1900.

By 1900, the settlers had drained the swamps and cleared the land making it more suitable for the farming of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. In the 1901 census, Steinbach had a population of 366, and almost the entire population still spoke Plautdietsch, with only a few reporting a knowledge of English.

===End of the Strassendorf (1910–1945)===
In 1910, the street village linear settlement, or Strassendorf (&quot;Straßendorf&quot; in German) for the community ended. Prior to this time, the settlers of Steinbach lived in long narrow strips, called &quot;Wirtschaft&quot; (plural: &quot;Wirtschaften&quot;), along the Steinbach Creek. Following the lead of the neighbouring Mennonite village of Blumenort, who had abandoned their Strassendorf system a year earlier, the village of Steinbach was surveyed and land was redistributed with individual titles to open-field properties. Those who were given inferior land were financially compensated by the others. Although a communal pasture for cattle was maintained for some decades after this, the end of the linear settlement meant the end of the traditional communal lifestyle of the Mennonites in this area, but also opened the area up to greater entrepreneurial enterprise. The mayor, or schulz, of Steinbach at this time was Johan G. Barkman, Steinbach&#x27;s longest serving schulz, who held that position for twenty-five years, including overseeing such significant events as the end of the Strassendorf. In 1911, the Kleine Gemeinde church, who had met in the village school up until this point, constructed a building on the south end of the village.
In 1912, J.R. Friesen opened a Ford auto dealership in town, which was the first Ford dealership in Western Canada. At the time, Friesen was excommunicated from the Kleine Gemeinde for adopting the modern technology, but within a few years, many Steinbachers accepted the automobile as an acceptable mode of transportation.

By this time, Steinbach had a third Mennonite church, the Bruderthaler, who, unlike the Kleine Gemeinde and Holdeman Mennonites, taught that being successful in business was not a sin and, in fact, was to be encouraged. The new theology moved Steinbach from a more traditional and agriculturally-based economy to one that emphasized business and industry. Entrepreneurs took advantage of the business opportunities at the time and several small businesses sprang up. Many other important and large businesses developed as well, helping to establish Steinbach as a regional service centre for the area.

By 1915, Steinbach had grown to a population of 463 and continued to attract immigrants from Europe. Many of the new immigrants were Bergthaler Mennonites, but Steinbach also was the destination for new German and Lutheran settlers, as well as some British families who had previously settled in the Clearspring Settlement slightly to the north. Steinbach&#x27;s first bank, the Royal Bank, opened in 1915.

During World War I, most Steinbach Mennonites were given an exemption from military service, as promised in the Privilegium they had agreed to upon immigration in the 1870s. Mistakenly considered &quot;ethnic Germans&quot;, even though they were actually primarily of Dutch ancestry, the Mennonites were caught up in the anti-German sentiment of the time and Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden banned Mennonites from Steinbach and other areas from voting in 1917.

A year later, in 1918, as soldiers returned to North America, Spanish flu struck the village, killing many. Mennonites in the region were particularly affected by the outbreak, dying at a rate nearly twice that of other ethnic groups.

After the First World War, Borden banned Mennonites and other pacifists from immigrating to Canada. The ban lasted for three years, from 1919 to 1922, when the new Liberal government lifted the ban. At the same time, there was the out-migration of the more conservative Mennonites, who left the area for Mexico and Paraguay, after the Canadian government required them to learn English and attend public schools, issues which seemed to be in violation of the Privilegium signed in 1873.

In 1920, the village of Steinbach was formed into an &quot;Unincorporated Village District&quot; of the Rural Municipality of Hanover.

After the Mennonite immigration ban was lifted in 1922 by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, a second wave of Mennonite immigration occurred due to the Russian Revolution, and many of the &quot;Russlander&quot; Mennonites took over farms and land left unoccupied by the Mennonites leaving for Latin America. During the 1920s, thousands of Mennonite refugees fled the Soviet Union, many of them arriving in the Steinbach area. Moscow Road, which had been pejoratively named to refer to the Russlander Mennonites who lived there, was later renamed McKenzie Avenue after the Prime Minister who had allowed them to come to Canada as refugees.

In 1931, local man Abraham Loewen founded the Loewen Funeral Chapel, the first funeral home in southeastern Manitoba, which decades later was taken over by his son Ray Loewen, who built the company into the Loewen Funeral Group, before its eventual downfall as depicted in the 2023 film &quot;The Burial&quot;.

In 1941, the Steinbach Credit Union opened, partially in response to the difficulty in obtaining loans from the larger banks.

During World War II, most Steinbachers who were eligible for the draft served in alternative service as conscientious objectors, though some also served in the active military. After the war, a third major wave of immigration boosted Steinbach&#x27;s population, with thousands of Mennonites again fleeing Europe.

===Incorporation as a town (1946–1996)===
Steinbach was incorporated as a town on 31 December 1946, with the Main Street being paved the following year. The new town elected Klaas Barkman as mayor who, along with councillor and auto-dealer A.D. Penner, had been instrumental in Steinbach&#x27;s incorporation. As the regional service centre for the area, Steinbach developed manufacturing, trucking, and retailing, particularly in automobile sales. Steinbach became known regionally as the &quot;Automobile City&quot;, a name coined by A.D. Penner.

From the 1940s to the 1960s, T.G. Smith, was a local bank manager who organized many of Steinbach&#x27;s first recreational activities, which the Mennonite population had been reluctant to adopt on their own.

In 1958, Leonard Barkman was elected mayor and served until 1970. Barkman, a member of the Liberal Party, also served as M.L.A. while mayor of Steinbach, a once common practice that is no longer permitted in Manitoba. Barkman was the first Mennonite from the area, who had previously eschewed this level of political involvement, to join the Manitoba Legislature.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Steinbach was home to many Christian revival meetings, including frequent visits by George Brunk, Ben D. Reimer and others. These meetings were held in a quonset just off of Main Street called The Tabernacle. The new more evangelical theology transformed the doctrine and practices of many of the local Mennonite churches and contributed to their assimilation. Many local churches adopted evangelical theology or merged it with their traditional Anabaptist theology, and some dropped the Mennonite label altogether.

In 1960, the Kleine Gemeinde church building, which by then was called the Evangelical Mennonite Conference, burned to the ground. The same year, the last traditional Mennonite housebarn in Steinbach was torn down by A.D. Penner. Partially in response to the destruction of heritage buildings in the area, such as the historic housebarn destroyed by A.D. Penner, residents in the 1960s saw the need to preserve and remember the Mennonite history of the region. In 1967, the Mennonite Heritage Village museum in Steinbach was opened.
In 1966, infamous gold thief Ken Leishman escaped from Headingly Jail and stole an airplane from Steinbach, solidifying his nickname as the &quot;Flying Bandit&quot;.

In 1970, the year of Manitoba&#x27;s centennial, Steinbach was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. A crowd of 10,000 waited along the streets of Steinbach as the royals visited, coming from the east along Highway 52 after their visit to La Brouqerie. &quot;The Carillon&quot; described the visit saying, &quot;it was the most memorable and exciting moment in the history of the Southeast. For the first time since the earliest European settlers arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, a member of the British royal family paid a personal visit to the communities of La Broquerie, Steinbach, Sarto, Grunthal and St. Pierre. For these communities and their people the visit by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles on the eve of Manitoba&#x27;s 100th birthday highlighted a century of economic and cultural development.&quot;

In 1972, Jake Epp, a former local high school teacher, was elected Member of Parliament in the region, the first Mennonite in the area to do so. Epp was also the first Mennonite to serve as a federal cabinet minister and was MP until 1993.

In May 1980, Steinbach&#x27;s first shopping mall, Clearspring Centre, opened on the north end of the community. The mall was named after the historic English and Scottish settlement in the area.

In fall of 1982, Steinbach drew considerable attention after the school board cancelled a scheduled rock concert in the local high school by Queen City Kids. Hundreds of students staged a protest as a result of the cancellation. The incident was alluded to years later in the work of novelist Miriam Toews.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Aussiedler Mennonites, who had remained in the Soviet Union (particularly Siberia and Kazakhstan) throughout much of the 20th century, or who had resettled in Germany during the 1970s, began to immigrate to the area and continued to do so through the 1990s and early 2000s. Some of these people had converted to the Baptist church during the decades in the Soviet Union. Over all, Steinbach&#x27;s growth slowed somewhat during the 1980s and early 1990s in comparison to the rate of growth in decades before or since.

In 1996, Les Magnusson was elected mayor of Steinbach, the first non-ethnic Mennonite to hold that position. Magnusson was a vocal opponent of attempts in Steinbach to allow liquor sales.

===Contemporary era (1997–present)===
With Les Magnusson as mayor, Steinbach was incorporated as a city on 10 October 1997. In 2000, the windmill at the Mennonite Heritage Village, a recognized symbol of the city, was destroyed by arsonists. It was rebuilt less than a year later with the assistance of Dutch millwrights.

Steinbach attracted prominent attention in 2004 when Mennonite author Miriam Toews, who was born and grew up in Steinbach, published her novel &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot;. The book became a bestseller, exploring a fictionalized town modelled after Steinbach. It won the 2004 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction, and was selected as the 2006 book for Canada Reads, the first book by a female writer to be chosen.

Steinbach continued to grow during Magnusson&#x27;s tenure and, after the election of Chris Goertzen as mayor in 2006, became one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada. In 2011, Steinbach was officially announced as Manitoba&#x27;s third-largest city, with the release of the population data from the 2011 Canadian Census. The growth was attributed to immigration from such countries as Germany, Russia, and the Philippines. Steinbach gained national recognition from such newspapers as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, which described the city as an immigration &quot;hotbed&quot; of Canada and a model for immigrant integration.

During March 2013, the city gained national attention when several community members, such as the Southland Community Church and Steinbach Christian High School expressed opposition to provincial Bill 18, an anti-bullying bill that would require the accommodation of gay-straight alliance groups in schools, including faith-based private schools. On 13 September 2013, Bill 18 passed without amendments. Partially in response to this issue, the city&#x27;s first Steinbach Pride parade was held in 2016. While initially expecting about 200 people, approximately 3,000 people attended the event. This was brought about in part by the fact that not a single elected official from the area attended or endorsed the event.

Ongoing rapid growth meant that the city needed more land and space in order to sustain itself. This led the city to negotiate an annexation of from the Rural Municipality of Hanover in 2015, the first major annexation for the city since 1979. Steinbach was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in August 2020, with the virus affecting community members, several businesses, and eventually an outbreak at Bethesda Place, the personal care home at Bethesda Regional Health Centre. By November 2020, Steinbach briefly had the highest per capita rate of Covid infections in Canada. The Bethesda Regional Health Centre was reportedly overwhelmed and out of beds on November 13, 2020, with patients having to be triaged in their cars.

Beginning in the 2020s, Steinbach became significantly more multicultural with 21% of the population being immigrants, many from The Philippines, India, Ukraine, and Nigeria.

===Liquor and cannabis licence referendums===
Despite being prohibited by local churches, Steinbach had alcohol sales, including beverage rooms, throughout the early 20th century. In 1950, however, Steinbach citizens voted to prohibit all liquor sales in the community, although a drinking establishment on Main Street called The Tourist Hotel was allowed to remain, until it closed in 1973.

Since the 1970s, Steinbach has had seven separate referendums on whether liquor sales should be allowed within the confines of the city, all of which failed until a 2003 referendum when Steinbach residents narrowly voted to allow limited liquor sales in the city, despite opposition from then mayor Les Magnusson. The 2003 referendum, however, passed only a dining room licence, permitting alcohol to be sold and served only with sales of food. In 2007, the issue of serving alcohol in restaurant lounges was defeated by only nine votes, while the sale of alcohol at sports facilities such as the Steinbach Fly-In Golf Course was approved. In February 2008, Steinbach Council voted in favour of opening a liquor store in the city. Eventually, the first Liquor Mart in Steinbach opened in March 2009, on PTH 12 North, operated by the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission.
The most recent public vote was held in October 2011. In this referendum, voters agreed to accept, by a large margin, the following three licences: beverage rooms, cocktail lounges, and private club licences.

In 2018, after the Canadian government legalized cannabis, Steinbach residents voted to deny the licensing of retail cannabis stores in the city.

==Geography==
Steinbach is located on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies, and is also located directly east of the Red River Valley. The flat land in Steinbach was originally a thick patch of poplar trees. The land was flat and very swampy, with the last of the swamps finally drained in 1900, which made the soil more arable and suitable for agriculture. Steinbach&#x27;s main geographic feature is the Steinbach Creek, which is now mostly dry, still runs along Elmdale Street. Due to higher levels of precipitation received than in the areas of western Manitoba, the natural prairie near Steinbach is defined as tallgrass prairie. Some of this original prairie can still be viewed at the Manitoba Tall Grass Prairie Preserve south of the city near Vita. The areas to the west and north of Steinbach are defined as flat tallgrass prairie, and part of the Lake Manitoba Plain. The areas south and west of the city progress steadily into treed aspen parkland, eventually growing into Sandilands Provincial Forest and the large boreal forest region extending east and north of the city.

Steinbach is close to many Canadian Shield lakes, such as those located in Whiteshell Provincial Park and the Lake of the Woods in Kenora. Lake Winnipeg (the Earth&#x27;s 11th largest freshwater lake) is located north of the city. Although no rivers flow through Steinbach, the city is sandwiched by the Seine River to the north and the Rat River to the south. Both are tributaries of the Red River, which flows into Lake Winnipeg.

Under the Köppen climate classification Steinbach has a warm summer continental climate (Dfb). The highest ever recorded temperature in Steinbach was on August 10, 1988, while the lowest ever recorded temperature was on February 2, 1996. The warmest month on average is July, while the coldest month on average is January. The average annual precipitation in Steinbach is , with June being the month with highest average precipitation.
==Economy==

As the economic centre of Southeastern Manitoba, service/retail industries employ the majority of the working population. Large manufacturing plants, especially those operated by Barkman, Bausch and Loewen Windows (which is also headquartered in Steinbach), create a significant number of jobs. Since the 1950s, Steinbach has been known as a centre for automobile sales, marketing itself as the &quot;Automobile City&quot;. Steinbach has a diversity of jobs and industries within the community. Its rapid growth rate, combined with the lowest taxes in the province by mill rate, has made the community an increasingly popular place for both workers and employers. This combination has helped many different mid-sized and large-sized businesses in manufacturing, transportation, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals, retail, and financial services such as the Steinbach Credit Union, to grow with the city. As a result, the city of Steinbach now has the third-highest assessment value among cities in the province, trailing only Brandon and Winnipeg.

Agriculture, the traditional industry in the region, continues to play a significant role in Steinbach&#x27;s economy as well. The agricultural industry in the area is notable for many of the large commercial pig and poultry farming operations. Aside from intensive pig and chicken barns there are numerous small, family, dairy farms that dot the area. Crops grown on the fertile farmland surrounding Steinbach primarily include canola, corn, alfalfa, as well as barley, soybeans, oats, and wheat.

Originally known as the Board of Trade, the Steinbach Chamber of Commerce has existed since the 1920s. The board changed its name to the Chamber of Commerce in 1954. For several decades, the chamber, including the local auto dealers, used the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Worth the Trip,&quot; to promote business in the area.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Steinbach had a population of 17,806 living in 6,836 of its 7,092 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 16,022. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. This places Steinbach as the third largest city in Manitoba. The average age of people in Steinbach is 37.8, below the provincial average of 39.2, while 52% of the population are female and 48% are male.

A total of 30% of Steinbach residents claim German as their mother tongue, which includes both High German and Plautdietsch, while nearly 80% of those with a second language claim knowledge of a Germanic language. As a whole, 39% of residents claim some mother tongue other than the official languages of French and English. Steinbach has an immigrant population of 21.39% or about 2,890 people, which is slightly above the provincial average of 18.33%.

The median after-tax household income in 2020 for Steinbach was $64,000, which is below the Manitoba provincial average of $69,000.

=== Ethnicity ===
Approximately twenty-four per cent of Steinbach residents claim German ancestry, though this may include those from Germany itself or of Mennonite background, which would more accurately be described as Dutch. In the 2021 Canadian census, the first to include &quot;Mennonite&quot; as an ethnic designation, nearly 20 per cent of the community reported Mennonite ethnicity, although a significantly higher number would have Mennonite ancestry.


=== Religion ===
Census data from 2011 shows that 88.73% of Steinbach residents report a religious affiliation, which is above the provincial average of 73.51%. Of those with a religious affiliation, 74.58% are Protestant, and 12.44% are Catholic. Less than 1% belonged to either Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Hinduism combined. In the total population surveyed, 11.27% claim no religious affiliation.

Steinbach is the headquarters of both the Evangelical Mennonite Conference, formerly known as the Kleine Gemeinde, and the Christian Mennonite Conference, formerly known as Chortitzer Mennonite Conference. The city has among the most churches per capita of any city in Canada, at one for every 500 people. Steinbach is home to at least 22 churches and while many of the smaller churches are Mennonite, the majority of Steinbach&#x27;s current population no longer attend a Mennonite church, and the largest churches in the city, such as the Emmanuel Evangelical Free Church, Southland Community Church, and Crossview Church, are either non-denominational or evangelical and are not part of Mennonite denominations. The city also has Roman Catholic, United, and Lutheran congregations and a growing Muslim community.

==Government==
===Civic government===
Steinbach is represented by six councillors and a mayor. The city is a single-tier municipality, governed by a mayor-council system, the mayor and council are elected every four years. The current mayor is Earl Funk.

Prior to incorporation as a town in 1946, Steinbach was part of the East Reserve and later Rural Municipality of Hanover. The entire area was led by an Oberschulz, while the village of Steinbach was governed by a Schulz (mayor) and Schultebott (council). Steinbach&#x27;s first schulz was Johann Reimer, while Steinbach&#x27;s longest-serving schulz was Johan G. Barkman (son of Rev. Jakob Barkman), who served as schulz for 25 years.

===Federal and provincial representation===

Currently, the city is represented federally by the Conservative Party of Canada and provincially by the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. The city and surrounding area comprise the provincial riding of Steinbach, which has been represented in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly by MLA Kelvin Goertzen since 2003. In federal politics, the city is part of the Provencher riding, which has been represented by MP Ted Falk since 2013.

===Sister city===
In 2018, Steinbach became a sister city with Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, which is near where all of Steinbach&#x27;s pioneering families immigrated from in the 1870s.

==Infrastructure and public services==
===Access===

Steinbach is unusual in that there are no railways or rivers passing through town, so transportation to and from Steinbach has always been by road. The city is located approximately 50 kilometers southeast of Winnipeg, in a direct line. There are two principal highways serving the city, Provincial Trunk Highways (PTH) 12 and 52, which intersect at downtown Steinbach. Travelers coming from Winnipeg can take the Trans-Canada Highway (PTH 1) east for 40 kilometers, turning south at PTH 12 and continuing for 20 kilometers. This entire route consists of four-lane limited-access highways. Alternatively, travelers can also take PTH 59 south from Winnipeg and then take PTH 52 east to Steinbach. PTH 12 south from Steinbach is single-lane and ends at the American border at Sprague. Steinbach is situated on an alternate route between Winnipeg and Thunder Bay, Ontario which is named MOM&#x27;s Way.

===Airports===
The City of Steinbach owns and maintains Steinbach Airport, a federally registered aerodrome located north of the city. The runway is and has an asphalt surface. The runway is serviced with lighting and a beacon for night-time use. Fuel and servicing are available on site and are provided through the Steinbach Flying Club. The airport also features aircraft tie-downs, a heated lounge building and restroom facilities.

Additionally, Harv&#x27;s Air Service operates Steinbach (South) Airport, a private aerodrome south of the city. The main runway is and has an asphalt and turf surface. An additional runway measuring intersects the main runway to the north.

===Health===
Health for the city and surrounding area is governed by Southern Health-Santé Sud. Acute care and emergency services are provided by the Bethesda Regional Health Centre.

===Utilities===
The water supply for Steinbach comes from three wells drilled into a limestone aquifer in K.R. Barkman Park and two wells were also recently established by Park Road West and Keating Road. It is then sent to a water treatment plant that was upgraded in 2006. Treated water storage is located in a tall elevated water tower that was built in 1972 and an additional underground water storage unit in 1999; combined they provide the community with of treated water. A new secondary water treatment plant was constructed in 2019 at a cost of $11.3 million to meeting the growing city&#x27;s demand for water. As of 2019, it was the city&#x27;s largest infrastructure project in its history.

==Education==

Steinbach is part of the Hanover School Division, which is one of the 37 school divisions in Manitoba. This is also the largest school division outside of the city of Winnipeg. The school system in Manitoba is dictated by the province through the Manitoba Public Schools Act. Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English.

The schools in Steinbach consist of three Early Years Elementary Schools: Woodlawn, Southwood and Elmdale which provide education from kindergarten through Grade 4. Grades 5 through 8 are currently provided by two newly formed Middle Schools: Stonybrook Middle School (formerly Steinbach Junior High School) and Clearspring Middle School (established 2012). Steinbach Regional Secondary School is a large public high school providing Grades 9 through 12 education for Steinbach and the surrounding region; it is the second largest school in Manitoba. Steinbach Christian School, a private school, offers all grades (Kindergarten – Grade 12).

Steinbach is home to the evangelical Anabaptist college Steinbach Bible College, which shares a campus with Steinbach Christian School. It also has a post-secondary learning campus called Eastman Education Centre, which offers courses from Red River College, University of Winnipeg, Assiniboine Community College and Providence University College.

===Cuisine===
Regional cuisine unique to Steinbach includes various Mennonite dishes such as vereniki, farmer sausage, sunflower seeds, yerba mate and roll kuchen. Mennonite homes frequently serve a light lunch on Sundays called &quot;faspa&quot; consisting of deli meats, cheese curds, pickles, buns, and dessert such as plautz. These items can be found at restaurants that specialize in Mennonite food, such as MJ&#x27;s Kafe and the Livery Barn Restaurant (at the Mennonite Heritage Village), as well as in local homes, community and church events, and on the menu of many other local restaurants.

In 2021, the Public Brewhouse and Gallery opened on Main Street in Steinbach, the first brewery to open in the former dry community, and the first privately run art gallery in the southeast.

===Festivals===
The Mennonite Heritage Village&#x27;s Pioneer Days festival, and the accompanying parade, has existed each August since the 1970s. Steinbach&#x27;s &#x27;Summer in the City&#x27; festival is held on Main Street each June. The annual Steinbach Pride event has been held each summer since 2016.

===Historical sites===
The Johann G. Barkman Heritage Walkway, stretching along Elmdale Drive, is named after an early long-time mayor, and features plaques and other historic markers documenting the life of the early Steinbach street village along the, now dry, Steinbach Creek. The city also features a self-guided Heritage Walking tour in the downtown area, which highlights sites along the Heritage Walkway and other historic buildings and locations such as the Pioneer Cemetery. In 2024, a historic plaque was placed in front of author Miriam Toews&#x27;s former Steinbach home.

===Jake Epp Library===
Steinbach&#x27;s first public library opened in 1973. Mary Barkman initiated the plan in 1968 and Jake Epp, former MP of Provencher, appointed the very first Library Board in 1973. The library initially was located in the former Kornelsen School, which is now the Steinbach Arts Council building. In 1997, the library moved into its own newly constructed building on historic Elmdale Street and was renamed the Jake Epp Library. After his death in 1998, the library revealed a plaque and reading garden honouring former local teacher Melvin Toews, father of author Miriam Toews and subject of her book &quot;Swing Low: A Life&quot;. Toews, along with Barkman, had been instrumental in founding the library in the 1970s. A major library expansion was completed in 2012.

===Literature===
Steinbach is known for having a significant place in the world of Mennonite literature. Arnold Dyck was the editor of the German-language &quot;Steinbach Post&quot; in the early 20th century and the first writer to use Plautdietsch as a written language. In the 1970s and 80s came the work of poet Patrick Friesen, author of &quot;The Shunning&quot; and many other works, novelist and literary critic Al Reimer, author of &quot;My Harp is Turned to Mourning&quot; and the Kleindarp stories, and Roy Vogt, founder of the &quot;Mennonite Mirror&quot; and the Mennonite Literary Society. Beginning in the 1990s, Steinbach&#x27;s most well-known author Miriam Toews has written numerous award-winning and bestselling novels, some of which are set in Steinbach. Her non-fiction book &quot;Swing Low: A Life&quot; is set in Steinbach, while her bestselling novels &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot; and &quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot;, as well as the film adaptation of the book, are set in the fictional East Village, widely regarded to be based on her hometown. &quot;Fight Night&quot;, inspired by Toews&#x27;s mother Elvira, also alludes to Steinbach. In 2016, Steinbach writer Andrew Unger started &quot;The Unger Review&quot; (formerly The Daily Bonnet), a website that publishes satirical Mennonite news stories, and published the novel &quot;Once Removed&quot; in 2020, which draws on fictional elements of Steinbach. Steinbach has also been home to novelist Byron Rempel, memoirist Lynette Loeppky, poets Lynnette D&#x27;anna, Luann Hiebert, and Audrey Poetker, as well as historians Royden Loewen and Delbert Plett, among others. In 2024, writer Andrew Unger initiated a plan to have a historic plaque placed in front of Miriam Toews&#x27;s teenage home in Steinbach. It was unveiled in fall of that year.

<text>St. Andrew&#x27;s College is an institution of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and is affiliated with the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. The college exists to promote spiritual, academic, cultural and moral leadership within the Church, the Ukrainian Canadian community, and the Canadian community.

== History ==
St. Andrew&#x27;s College traces its beginnings to Pastoral Courses in Theology that were conducted in Saskatoon and Regina since 1918. In 1932, those courses evolved into Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Seminary and moved to Winnipeg.

St. Andrew&#x27;s College would officially be established in 1946 in the north end of Winnipeg, and included the following programs:
* Academic programs in the Faculty of Theology
** Diploma in Theology (2 year program)
** Certificate in Theology (1 year program)
** Bachelor of Theology (4 year program)
** Master of Divinity (1 year program)
* High school program
* Ukrainian Cultural Summer Courses
In 1962, St. Andrew&#x27;s College became an associated college of the University of Manitoba. In 1964, the college moved to the university campus. As courses in the Arts Faculty grew, the college became an affiliated college to the university in 1981 and established the Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies.

<text>Men &quot;The Master&quot; Nguyen (; born 1954 in Phan Thiet, Vietnam) is a Vietnamese-American professional poker player.

==Personal life==
In 1967, he dropped out of school at age 13 and became a bus driver to help support his family. In early 1978, a staunch anti-Communist, he escaped from the Communist regime of Vietnam by boat and sailed with 87 compatriots to Pulau Besar in Malaysia. In 1978, he received political asylum from the United States and settled in Los Angeles, California. In 1986, he became an American citizen. In 1984 he went on a junket to Las Vegas and played poker for the first time in his life. He continued to go every weekend and lose hundreds of dollars, earning him the nickname &quot;Money Machine&quot;. However, he quickly mastered the game, winning his first tournament in 1987. With his poker earnings, he opened a dry cleaning business and furniture store, but sold them in 1990 because they took too much of his time and didn&#x27;t make enough money. Through these businesses he would, however, meet and work with many Vietnamese people who would fall under his tutelage.

Nguyen met his future wife, Van, in Vietnam. He eventually brought her to the United States, where they settled in Bell Gardens, California. Men and Van have three children. Van Nguyen learned poker from her husband. She won the World Poker Tour Celebrity Invitational in March 2008, becoming the first woman to ever win a WPT mixed event.

==Professional poker career==
Nguyen has over 475 finishes in the money, and has won more than 95 tournaments. Nguyen is known for tutoring players, many of whom go on to be successful in their own right, including his cousins David Pham, Minh Nguyen, and his wife Van Nguyen. Men receives a portion of some of his students&#x27; winnings. In 1991 one of his students gave him the nickname &quot;The Master,&quot; and now he is widely known as &quot;Men the Master.&quot; He donates a portion of the money he earns through tournaments and tutoring to charities in Vietnam, and in 1996, with the earnings from his final-table finish in the World Series of Poker, built a kindergarten in Vietnam.

Nguyen won the Card Player Magazine Player of the Year award in 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2005 and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished tournament players in the world. While allegations have been made regarding Nguyen&#x27;s possible involvement with tournament cheating, nothing has been proven and Nguyen has consistently denied any such actions. As of 2022, his total live tournament earnings exceed $11,000,000. His cashes at WSOP events account for over $4,100,000 of those winnings.

Nguyen has won seven WSOP bracelets over three decades.

<text>Johann von Hoverbeck (1 December 1606 – 6 April 1682) was a Prussian diplomat.
Hoverbeck&#x27;s parents were &quot;Nikolaus von Hoverbeck&quot;, a derivative of a Flemish noble family, who emigrated in 1570 from Brabant to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and &quot;Ursula Gutteter-Dobrodziejski&quot;, a derivative from a patrician family in Kraków. Johann von Hoverbeck, born in Aleksandrowice, a manor in the vicinity of Kraków, since 1614 attended the high school in Danzig (Gdańsk). Since 1624 he undertook an extended educational journey through Europe and visited France (Paris, University of Sedan), the Netherlands, England (University of Oxford, London), Italy and Hungary. He returned home in June, 1630. In 1631 he took up duties in governmental services of Brandenburg and dealt with foreign affairs, especially concerning Poland. 
He was an envoy of Brandenburg-Prussia in Poland from 1631 to 1682. He was a political architect and co-signer of the Treaty of Wehlau in 1657 and participated also in the Treaty of Oliva in 1660. During his political career he acted as an advisor to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. As a gratification for his diplomatical achievements Frederick William presented to him in 1653 the manor of Eichmedien (Nakomiady) in Masuria, Duchy of Prussia. In 1663 the title of a baron war awarded to Johann von Hoverbeck.

In 1644 Hoverbeck married &quot;Anna Sophia&quot;, a daughter of &quot;Wolf Dietrich von Rochow&quot;. Anna Sophia, with whom he had eleven children, died in 1659. His son Johann Dietrich von Hoverbeck became a diplomat too. Hoverbeck died in 1682 in Hohenstein (Olsztynek) in Masuria, Duchy of Prussia.

<doc id="986749" wikidata="Q1377152" url="?curid=986749" title="West Iberian languages">
<text>West Iberian is a branch of the Ibero-Romance languages that includes the Castilian languages (Spanish, Judaeo-Spanish), Astur-Leonese (Asturian, Leonese, Mirandese, Extremaduran (sometimes), Cantabrian), Navarro-Aragonese and the descendants of Galician-Portuguese.

Until a few centuries ago, they formed a dialect continuum covering the western, central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula—excepting the Basque and Catalan-speaking territories. This is still the situation in a few regions, particularly in the northern part of the peninsula, but due to the differing sociopolitical histories of these languages (independence of Portugal since the early 12th century, unification of Spain in the late 15th century under the Catholic Monarchs, who privileged Castilian Spanish over the other Iberian languages), Spanish and Portuguese have tended to overtake and to a large extent absorb their sister languages while they kept diverging from each other.

There is controversy over whether the members of the modern Galician-Portuguese and Astur-Leonese sub-groups are languages or dialects. A common, though disputed, classification is to state that Portuguese and Galician are separate languages, as are Asturian, Leonese, and Mirandese. Cantabrian and Extremaduran are considered codialects of the Leonese language for UNESCO, whereas the latter is a Castilian dialect in the ISO codes.

Papiamento is a West Iberian creole language spoken in the Dutch West Indies and believed to be derived from Portuguese, Judaeo-Portuguese and Spanish.

<text>Robert Perkins Bass (September 1, 1873July 29, 1960) was an American farmer, forestry expert, and Republican politician from Peterborough, New Hampshire. He served in both houses of the New Hampshire Legislature and as chairman of the state&#x27;s Forestry Commission before serving as the 53rd governor of New Hampshire from 1911 to 1913.

He started one of the state&#x27;s political dynasties. Both his son, Perkins Bass, and grandson, Charles F. Bass, were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His wife, Edith Harland Bird, was the daughter of Massachusetts businessman Charles Sumner Bird. His daughter, Joanne, was the first wife of Marshall Field IV, heir to the Marshall Field&#x27;s fortune and publishing mogul.

==Early life==
The son of Perkins Bass and Clara (Foster) Bass, he was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1873, but his family moved to Peterborough when he was nine in 1883. He grew up on a family farm that is still owned by his descendants. He graduated from Harvard College in 1896.

Gertrude Bass Warner (May 14, 1863 – July 29, 1951), an art collector with particular interests in Asian art, was his sister.

==Career==
He was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1905 and 1909 and the New Hampshire Senate in 1910. He was the state&#x27;s governor from 1911 to 1913.

His status was hurt, however, after 1912. That year, he had supported Theodore Roosevelt for president, in the breakaway Progressive Party, against the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft. The move threw the state Republicans into disarray and led to a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature. In retaliation, the party rejected Bass when he sought a US Senate seat in 1913 and 1926.

Bass is remembered today for his stint as chairman of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission when popular concern with forests&#x27; well-being was intense because of extreme overlogging in the White Mountains. Also notable is his sponsorship of legislation that led to the first direct primary law east of the Mississippi River.

In 1945, Bass, along with retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts, convened the assembly that produced the Dublin Declaration, which proposed the transformation of the United Nations General Assembly into a world legislature with &quot;limited but definite and adequate power for the prevention of war.&quot; he died in 1960.

<text>St. Louis University High School (SLUH) is an all-male Jesuit high school in St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in 1818, it is the oldest secondary educational institution in the United States west of the Mississippi River, and one of the largest private high schools in Missouri. It is located in the Archdiocese of St. Louis.

==History==
SLUH was founded in 1818 by the bishop of St. Louis, Louis Dubourg, as a Latin school for boys known as St. Louis Academy. Classes were held in a one-story house owned by Madame Alvarez on the northwest corner of Third and Market Street. It quickly grew to include a college division, and the college was granted university status in 1832. The high school retained the identity of St. Louis Academy on the university campus until 1924 when it moved to its own facilities and incorporated separately under the name of St. Louis University High School. The school&#x27;s new home, on Oakland Avenue, was a gift of Anna Backer in memory of her late husband and alumnus George Backer. That facility, also known as Backer Memorial, has grown considerably over the years and remains the school&#x27;s home.

The high school integrated when it enrolled John Carter, a sophomore transfer from Saint Thomas Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1946, one year before Cardinal Joseph Ritter issued a pastoral letter desegregating all Catholic schools in the St. Louis Archdiocese. While Carter did not graduate from the school, the first Black graduate of SLUH was Al Thomas, also a sophomore transfer and a member of the class of 1950. The first four-year Black graduate was Eldridge Morgan, a member of the class of 1951.

In 1984, Paul Owens became the school&#x27;s first lay principal. In 2002, Dr. Mary Schenkenberg became its first female principal. In 2005, the David J. Laughlin was hired as the school&#x27;s first lay president.

In each year from 2013 to 2016, SLUH was named among the top-scoring organizations in the mid-size employer category of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch&#x27;s survey of Top Workplaces.

==Academics==
Since the school is part of the Jesuit network that consists of 61 high schools and 28 colleges and universities in the United States, SLUH provides an education infused with the tradition and philosophy of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Theology and philosophy classes are conducted daily.

According to figures released on SLUH&#x27;s website in 2011, the median ACT score for SLUH students is over 30. By composite score, it ranks among the top 7% of schools in the United States. Over 50% of SLUH&#x27;s class of 2011 achieved a score of 30 or higher on the ACT. Among St. Louis and St. Louis area high schools with a total enrollment of over 600, it had the highest scores in 2012. Since 2005 a total of 31 students have received a 36, the highest score possible. Four members of the class of 2012 achieved this score, along with five members of the class of 2013, and two members of the class of 2014. More recently, seven students from the class of 2024 achieved this score.

In 2010, 23 students from SLUH were named National Merit Scholarship Program Semifinalists, more than any other school in Missouri. In 2011, 17 students were named Semifinalists, while 28 were named National Merit Commended Scholars. In 2012, 25 students were named Semifinalists, while 29 were named Commended Scholars.

Advanced Placement (AP) courses have been offered through SLUH for half a century. AP courses are now offered for 22 disciplines. In 2010, 345 students took 790 AP exams. Eighty-seven percent scored a 3, 4 or 5, grades that qualify them for college credit.

SLUH has also performed well in the Presidential Scholars Program. In 2007, for example, three of Missouri&#x27;s ten semifinalists were from SLUH, with one, Daniel Viox, receiving one of the two scholarships awarded. In 2012, one of Missouri&#x27;s ten semifinalists was from SLUH.

The humanities are emphasized in SLUH&#x27;s curriculum. The language department has offered four-year programs in Russian and Chinese since 1964. In 1997, a student exchange program with the Nanjing Foreign Language School was established. Since 2011, SLUH has sponsored a Confucius Classroom which is a subdivision of Webster University&#x27;s Confucius Institute. In 1999, educational exchange programs for the study of Russian language and culture were established with schools in St. Petersburg. In keeping with its strong Jesuit Catholic heritage, courses in Latin and Greek are offered, as are the popular choices of French, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. SLUH also has strong programs in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, fine arts, and literature.

Virtually all SLUH students immediately enter colleges or universities upon graduation. Members of the Class of 2011 were accepted at 203 colleges and universities and attended 72 of them. These students accepted more than 300 scholarships totaling nearly $2 million.

In The Washington Post&#x27;s 2015 ranking of America&#x27;s Most Challenging High Schools, SLUH was ranked among the top three in Missouri and the top 1.5% nationwide. In the Post&#x27;s 2016 ranking, SLUH was ranked among the top 1.2% nationwide. The United States Department of Education&#x27;s National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognized SLUH as an Exemplary High Performing National Blue Ribbon School for 2015. In 2016, Niche ranked SLUH as the 19th-best All-Boys high school in the US.

==Facilities==
The first major reconstruction of the SLUH campus came in the 1980s, when then-principal Fr. Thomas Cummings, S.J. began the &quot;E-3&quot; campaign. This was highlighted by the construction of the Robertson Library and the development of property fronting Oakland Avenue, including the football stadium and upper parking lot. Development continued in the 1990s with the inauguration of the performing arts wing highlighted by a 610-seat theater, named after longtime drama teacher Joseph Schulte in the 2000s. Previously the school auditorium/theater had been located within the main school building, and its move allowed for a large expansion of classrooms and office space. The Jesuits also moved out of the Backer Memorial building around this time and into nearby houses the school purchased: the &quot;J-wing&quot; then became home to the theology department, several classrooms, and the administrative offices.

In the late 1990s, a large capital campaign to fund growth and expansion projects began under Fr. Paul Sheridan, S.J. Called Vision 2000 (V2K), the $32 million plan included reducing class sizes, better integrating technology into the curriculum, and increasing class options.

The early phases of the program included the addition of new teaching and counseling positions in order to reduce class size and teaching loads and to expand the curriculum. Over eight years, 18 new teaching and counseling positions were added.

The physical improvements began in 2004 when the football stadium was given artificial turf and a new entry boulevard to the west of the campus was constructed jointly with the adjacent St. Louis Science Center, along with a new shared parking facility. The construction continued with the addition of a 17-acre soccer–track complex and Sheridan Stadium, a new baseball field.

In 2009 SLUH completed the Danis Field House, a free-standing field house that contains two gymnasium spaces, a wrestling room, offices and meeting space for the athletic staff, and locker facilities. 

==Activities==
SLUH is competitive in many academic events such as math contests, Math League, Speech Team, Mock Trial and Quizbowl (Academic Team). SLUH was the top-scoring high school in the Missouri chapter of Math League for five years running. The Quizbowl team of 2006-07 won the district title and second place at the state competition along with the individual second place medal.

==Sports and rivalries==
SLUH&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Jr. Billikens, or Jr. Bills. Their rivals are Christian Brothers College High School. They compete in the Metro Catholic Conference. In Missouri state competition (MSHSAA), they compete at the largest classification and have won many state championships, including the following: water polo 22 times, basketball four times (1946, 1952, 1958, 1961), soccer four times (1972, 1990, 2003, 2024), tennis three times (1970, 1981, 2006), ice hockey four times (2013, 2018, 2019, 2022), swimming and diving three times (1956, 2003, 2018), cross country five times (1961, 1999, 2009, 2012, 2013), golf once, track and field once (2006), football once (1970), lacrosse once (2009), volleyball five times (2003, 2007, 2008, 2015, 2016). In addition, they field teams in multiple other sports such as racquetball, target shooting, inline hockey, rugby union, and ultimate frisbee.

<doc id="986755" wikidata="Q8349158" url="?curid=986755" title="Hurricane Joan–Miriam">
<text>Hurricane Joan was a long lived and powerful tropical cyclone that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane&#x27;s path.

After crossing Central America into the Pacific, the cyclone was renamed Tropical Storm Miriam, with the system&#x27;s dissipation occurring southwest of Mexico. Joan–Miriam was the final hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season and the final named storm of the Pacific hurricane season.

==Meteorological history==

At the time, Joan was one of the latest tropical cyclones to form in the central Atlantic in any season. It formed from an area of convection in the Intertropical Convergence Zone that moved off the coast of Africa early in October. It developed banding and was upgraded to Tropical Depression Seventeen on October 10 and later designated as Tropical Storm Joan while located at low latitude in the central Atlantic Ocean.
Joan gradually strengthened as it passed over the southern Windward Islands on October 15. It continued heading west in response to a strong ridge, and passed over the Guajira Peninsula on October 17. After entering the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, Joan strengthened into a hurricane. It then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop, possibly in response to the nearby Tropical Depression Eighteen. Upwelling caused by the quasi-stationary hurricane weakened the system. As the nearby depression dissipated, Joan resumed its westward track. A strong anticyclone over the southwestern Caribbean Sea created an extremely favorable environment, and Joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of 38 millibars in the space of a day. With a minimum pressure of 932 millibars, Joan was one of the strongest October hurricanes since 1961. At the time, it was located at 12°N, the southernmost Category 4 hurricane ever recorded at the time. That record has since been broken by Hurricane Ivan.

Joan made landfall just south of Bluefields on October 22. It passed over the northern portion of Lake Nicaragua, passed over Managua, and entered the Pacific Ocean near Leon on October 23. Joan remained a hurricane or tropical storm during its entire passage over Central America, and was a minimal tropical storm when it reached the Pacific. As per the policy at the time, Joan was renamed Miriam.

Tropical Storm Miriam hugged the coast of Central America and reached its peak of 986 millibars on October 24. Ordinarily, a pressure this low would indicate a Category 1 hurricane, but due to its disorganized convection, Miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane. Land interaction and wind shear weakened Miriam to a tropical depression on October 26. Low-level winds carried the system out to sea, and its convection dissipated on October 28.

Miriam&#x27;s remnants continued out to sea, and they regenerated on October 30. The tropical depression hung on for the next few days, until its second, and final, dissipation on November 2.

===Unusual path===
Hurricane Joan&#x27;s path through the southern Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of an Atlantic-basin tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan&#x27;s. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived the passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only thirteen other storms have been known to survive the crossover between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

==Preparations==
Tropical storm watches and later warnings were issued for the Windward Islands as far north as Martinique on October 13. They were dropped over the subsequent two days as Joan passed through. Along the coast of South America, additional warnings were raised and later dropped as Joan paralleled the coast.

The first hurricane watches were issued for parts of Panama, and Providencia starting on October 18. The watch area was expanded to include Costa Rica and Nicaragua on October 19 as the watches were upgraded to warnings. These warnings provided several hours&#x27; worth of lead time, allowing evacuations and preparations to be made. In addition, flash flood and mudslide warnings were issued for western Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua starting on October 21.

In response to Miriam, the flood and mudslide warnings issued because of Joan were not lifted until October 23 and 25. Tropical Storm warnings were issued for the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and the Gulf of Fonseca on October 24. They were dropped the next day. Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively. All warnings and watches were discontinued later on October 25 as Miriam turned away from the coast.

Despite the dangers from the intense hurricane, evacuations in Bluefields were met with resistance and disbelief from residents. In Managua, 70,000 people were evacuated to safe areas. In the remaining areas of Nicaragua, 300,000 people were evacuated. In Costa Rica, a total of 55,000 people were evacuated.

==Impact==

Hurricane Joan killed at least 216 people, with 118 unaccounted for. The total cost of damage was around $2 billion (1988 USD). All of the deaths and most of the damage were due to the Joan portion of Hurricane Joan–Miriam.

===Lesser Antilles===
No casualties were reported in the Windward Islands, including Grenada, where, on October 15, Joan made landfall. Passing just south, Joan brought rough seas and winds of with gusts to to the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao on October 16, damaging coastal facilities and roofs. Structural damage from the storm was estimated at $1.5 million (1988 USD). Increased moisture in Joan&#x27;s wake caused persistent rainfall on the islands for several days, leading to widespread flooding. In Trinidad and Tobago, Joan was described as a &quot;minor inconvenience&quot;. Sustained winds up to with gusts up to were recorded on Grenada. Heavy rains amounted to in St. George&#x27;s. Significant flooding was reported throughout the island, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. A rare invasion of African desert locusts in the Windward Islands were blamed on the storm.
===South America===
In Venezuela, 11 people were killed due to flash-flooding caused by heavy rains. Landslides and flooding killed 25 people in Colombia. The rains and flooding left 27,000 people homeless. Throughout Colombia, damages amounted to $1 billion.

===Nicaragua===
Most of the destruction was in Nicaragua. Throughout the country, 148 people perished, 184 were badly hurt, and 100 were unaccounted for. Roughly 23,300 homes were destroyed, with 6,000 being damaged. Many settlements on the Atlantic coast of the country were completely destroyed. The national electric company had of downed power lines, at the cost of 2.5 million USD (1988 dollars). A port being constructed with Bulgarian help at El Bluff was severely damaged. On a brighter note, public health measures managed to keep the death toll lower than it could have been.

Bluefields was hit with extreme impact. Almost all of the 7,500 structures in the city were demolished or had their roofs blown off. The majority of the main buildings in the city were destroyed. The hurricane also wreaked havoc on agriculture in the country. Around 15,700 head of cattle, 20,000 pigs, and 456,000 chickens were killed. The hurricane caused severe disruption in most of Nicaragua&#x27;s remaining rain forests in the areas it hit, and also stripped trees of leaves. In the southeast rain forests, Joan toppled or snapped 80 percent of the trees and completely destroyed of canopy. Hurricane Joan caused transportation difficulties in the country. Floodwaters destroyed 30 bridges and seriously damaged 36 others. Roads totaling in length were washed away.

In an unfortunate coincidence, Hurricane Joan hit shortly after an armed conflict in the region had started to cool off. The hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in Nicaragua, contributing to a recession that was already underway. The losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under 200 million dollars (1988 USD). These factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis. Government spending to rebuild infrastructure negated recently introduced anti-inflation measures. Hurricane Joan was a partial cause of Nicaraguans being, on average, worse-off than they were in the 1970s. In all, the storm left at least 250,000 people homeless. Total damages in the country amounted to $751.1 million. Joan was the first major hurricane to strike Nicaragua since Edith in 1971.

===Rest of Central America===
In Costa Rica, 28 people were killed, 75 were injured, and 18 were missing. Rainfall caused 20 rivers to burst their banks, flooding 75 settlements, including the city of Quepos, Costa Rica on the Pacific coast. At Ciudad Neily, Costa Rica, the Rio Corredores broke through a dike. In total, 7,500 Costa Ricans were rendered homeless. Damages in Costa Rica amounted to $65 million.

In the remaining portions of Central America, heavy rainfall, locally exceeding , was reported. These rains caused flooding and landslides, especially in mountainous regions. Those heavy rains caused seven deaths in Panama and left $60 million in damages.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Miriam caused the cancellation of flights from the airport at Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The highest rainfall reported recorded was at Lázaro Cárdenas. In small settlements, rivers were flooded and mudslides were reported. Casualties from the flooding are not known.

==Aftermath==
The response to requests for international aid was moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500 tons of food and medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch governments contributed aid amounting to 2 million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow response to requests for aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government&#x27;s actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.

On October 28, 1988, the United Nations General Assembly passed without a vote Resolution 17 of its 43rd session in response to the disaster. The resolution called on countries to contribute to the relief effort.

=== Retirement ===

On account of the deaths and destruction caused by the hurricane in the Atlantic basin, the name &quot;Joan&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1989. The name &quot;Miriam&quot; was not retired. &quot;Joan&quot; was replaced with &quot;Joyce&quot; for the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season.

<text>Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann.

==History==
Del Rey Manga was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as &quot;Tsubasa Chronicle&quot; and &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that &quot;Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts&quot;.

In October 2010, Kodansha and Random House announced that the US division of Kodansha, Kodansha USA, will take over publishing over all Del Rey Manga titles as well as their own manga, starting on December 1. Random House will act as the sales and marketing distributor.

==Titles==
Del Rey made its debut in May 2004 with four manga titles:

==Plot summary==

===Elminster: The Making of a Mage===

As a young boy, tending sheep in the fertile countryside of the nation of Athlanthar, Elminster has his first encounter with magic: the destruction of his entire hometown by a vicious dragon-riding magelord. The only survivor of the tragedy, Elminster joins a troupe of bandits and later a gang of thieves in the nearby city of Hastarl. Fed up with the rule and power of arrogant mages, Elminster sneaks into a temple of Mystra with the intent of defacing it, leading to a face-to-face confrontation with the goddess. Instead of unleashing her wrath upon the upstart youth, she questions him; based upon his wise and honest answers and his exceptional potential, Mystra instructs Elminster in the ways of magic. He becomes a powerful cleric and mage, one of her Chosen – a title rarely given and accompanied by a host of powers and duties.

===Elminster in Myth Drannor===

After winning the freedom of Athlanthar from the power-mad magelords, becoming king, and subsequently abdicating his throne, Elminster follows the edict of Mystra to enter the forest of Cormanthor. Stumbling upon a patrol of elves beset by monsters, he rescues the sole survivor and comforts him in his dying moments. Given a sacred duty to return the family&#x27;s mind stone (kiira) to its rightful place, he sneaks into the City of Cormanthor under threat of death (as elves will kill any non-elves in Cormanthor on sight) to return the kiira and complete his vow. Though not accepted by most of the noble caste, Elminster convinces the ruling Coronal and the powerful guardian of the forest, the Shrinshee, to trust and teach him. Surviving many tests of strength and will, as well as attempts at assassination, he learns powerful elven magic and plays a large part in the eventual seeding of Cormanthor&#x27;s Mythal.

===The Temptation of Elminster===

Tempted by Mystra and Shar, Elminster must choose to follow his heart or his goddess.

===Elminster in Hell===

Thrown through a portal into the Hell-plane of Avernos, Elminster is captured by the outcast archdevil Nergal and struggles to survive his memories being replayed and torn from his mind.

===Elminster&#x27;s Daughter===

Through the lens of Elminster&#x27;s daughter, Narnra, a thief from Waterdeep, the novel examines the long-term effect of Elminster&#x27;s meddling with the nation of Cormyr, which he helped create and protect. 

===Elminster Must Die===

When the goddess of magic is murdered, Elminster&#x27;s world shatters. Once the most powerful wizard in the world, he is now a tired old man; his habit of saving the world has resulted in a number of enemies. Elminster is also feeding powerful magic items to the Simbul, his lover, to keep her sane, but collecting these items leads his enemies to him.

<doc id="986786" wikidata="Q370769" url="?curid=986786" title="How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb">
<text>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 22 November 2004 in the United Kingdom by Island Records and a day later in the United States by Interscope Records. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with additional production from Chris Thomas, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Flood, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville. Much like their previous album &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000), the record exhibits a more mainstream rock sound after the band experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s.

Looking for a more hard-hitting sound than that of their previous album, U2 began recording &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album&#x27;s worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as &quot;our first rock album. It&#x27;s taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this is our first rock album.&quot; Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.

&quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and reached number one in 34 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled the band&#x27;s previous personal best. The album and its singles won all eight Grammy Awards for which they were nominated. It was also the fourth-highest-selling album of 2004, with almost ten million copies sold, and it yielded several successful singles, such as &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;. The album was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Decade&quot; at number 68. U2 commemorated the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary with a remastered re-release, which includes a companion album of tracks from the recording sessions called &quot;How to Re-Assemble an Atomic Bomb&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
Heading into &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;, U2&#x27;s guitarist the Edge said the group felt it was the appropriate moment to explore their early musical inspirations. U2&#x27;s lead vocalist Bono said in a 2005 interview, &quot;I went back and listened to all the music that made me want to be in a band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary.&quot; U2 also wanted to make a concerted effort to revisit the same creative approach from their formative years: the ethos of the band members playing together in a room, with just guitar, bass, and drums. The Edge said: &quot;The limitations that that creates are an interesting challenge because you have to do it with just those instruments, and dynamics become a hugely important part of the creative process.&quot;

===Sessions with Thomas===
Rather than repeat themselves after their previous record, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000), U2 were seeking a harder-hitting, more guitar-driven rock sound in response to the success of the album&#x27;s single &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;. As a result, they hired producer Chris Thomas, who had worked on some of their favourite records, including &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; by the Sex Pistols and early works by Roxy Music. The Edge said that he wanted Thomas to put the same stamp on U2&#x27;s record that he had done on &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;, &quot;The White Album&quot; by the Beatles, and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; by Pink Floyd. U2 began recording with Thomas in February 2003; the Edge said the sessions were intended to have a &quot;visceral band sound&quot;, and that he wanted a guitar tone like Steve Jones&#x27;s on &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;. To get into the desired creative mindset, the group continued their &quot;power hour&quot; tradition that began years prior with their long-time producer Daniel Lanois; several times a week, regardless of what they were working on, the band set aside time to improvise new material together, often producing two or three new song ideas. The Edge said this generated intrigue around the new pieces of music and used &quot;the right kind of chaos where a radical element will be the thing that we&#x27;ll all jump on to work with, whatever it might be&quot;.

The Edge said that in retrospect, the group struggled with Thomas at the production helm. They had begun with a lot of basic song ideas that were &quot;out of focus&quot;, which they sensed Thomas was not accustomed to. The Edge said when it came to realising their &quot;visceral band in the room&quot; approach, U2 &quot;over-emphasised [their] songwriterly methodology and didn&#x27;t trust enough the raw energy of what a band can do&quot;. He thought they had made progress with Thomas, but upon listening to rough mixes of their material, they realised that their desire to musically &quot;push the chaos further&quot; was being tempered by Thomas&#x27;s instinct to rein them in, and that the songs sounded &quot;too polite&quot;. Late in 2003, the band visited AIR Studios in London to record overdubs with a 20-person string section &quot;to give a few songs some lift&quot;. Bassist Adam Clayton called the session the moment &quot;the wheels came off&quot;; he sensed the musicians&#x27; lack of enthusiasm for the band&#x27;s music, saying: &quot;We could read the room. And they were not going, &#x27;Wow, guys, this is really happening!&#x27;&quot;

After nine months of work, the band had completed an album&#x27;s worth of songs. In October 2003, they met in Dublin to review their work. Bono and the Edge believed it was good enough to release; Bono said, &quot;All we needed was the assent of the politburo and the record would have been out for Christmas.&quot; Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr., however, disagreed with their bandmates and voted against releasing the record. Mullen said that the songs &quot;had no magic&quot;, while Clayton said, &quot;When it comes to signing off on a project, you ask questions like, &#x27;Have we got a first single to open the campaign?&#x27; Frankly, we were missing more than just a first single.&quot; Clayton and Mullen also felt that &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; had been overpraised, and they considered &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; to be the only hit single that the album generated. Clayton thought that if U2&#x27;s goal was to continue to be the world&#x27;s biggest band, they needed three or four hits from their album that could attract new fans.
The group brought in their long-time producer Steve Lillywhite to mediate the disagreement. After they played him the album, Lillywhite assessed that it felt like &quot;it had the weight of the world on its shoulders. It certainly wasn&#x27;t any fun.&quot; After lengthy discussions, Bono and the Edge were convinced that the album needed more work. Bono thought their songs were good but admitted &quot;good won&#x27;t bring you to tears or make you want to leave your house and tour for a year&quot;. Without making any firm decision on the album&#x27;s producer, the group decided to undertake recording sessions with Lillywhite and see where it led them.

===Sessions with Lillywhite===
The band began recording with Lillywhite and his assistant Jacknife Lee in Dublin in January 2004. The Edge says that the group quickly fell into a much more organic creative process with Lillywhite, with he and Lee reworking songs and encouraging better performances from the band. One of the first tracks on which Lillywhite made an impact was &quot;Native Son&quot;. While Bono was away for a few days, Lillywhite suggested the band record a better take of the song. After Bono returned and attempted to record vocals over the new backing track, he quickly decided that the lyrics no longer suited the song and that he would need a new lyrical and melodic approach; this ultimately led to the song&#x27;s evolution into &quot;Vertigo&quot;.

Lillywhite and Lee ultimately worked with the band for six months. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Brian Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record&#x27;s &quot;sonic cohesion&quot;.

A demo version of the album (guitarist the Edge&#x27;s copy) was stolen while the band were having their photo taken for a magazine in France in July 2004. It contained unfinished versions of several songs that made it onto the album. The band publicly announced that if those tracks were leaked online, they would release the album immediately via the iTunes Store. Several months later, the finished album was leaked online, but the band did not release it earlier, despite previous comments.

In late 2004, &quot;Mercy&quot;, an unreleased track taken from the &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; sessions, surfaced on the Internet through a fan who had been given a copy of the album containing the extra track. The track is of less than standard audio quality, but managed to become a favorite on fan websites. It was cut from the final release, but was described by &quot;Blender&quot; as &quot;a six-and-a-half-minute outpouring of U2 at its most uninhibitedly U2-ish&quot;. The lyrics to the song can be found in the booklet for the Special Limited Edition. A significantly revised version of the song was performed during the European leg of the U2 360° Tour; it made its live debut on 12 September 2010 during the second Zurich concert, and was officially released as the opening track on the band&#x27;s &quot;Wide Awake in Europe&quot; vinyl-only live EP that November.

==Composition==
As with &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, this album finds U2 returning to &quot;more &#x27;stripped down&#x27; rock and pop sounds&quot;, according to musicologist Susan Fast.

Adam Clayton said of &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s very much a guitar record. &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Love and Peace&quot;, &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot;, &quot;All Because of You&quot;, all pretty up, rocky tunes. A lot of them are a kick-back to our very early days, so it&#x27;s like with each year we have gathered a little bit more and this is what we are now.&quot;

In 2003, Bono said one of their new songs called &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; was &quot;the mother of all rock songs&quot; and &quot;the reason to make a new album&quot;. A similar demo called &quot;Native Son&quot; was also recorded. Both of these demos would later become &quot;Vertigo&quot;.

Contemporary Christian artist Michael W. Smith joined the band in the studio during the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; sessions and worked on at least one track with them, entitled &quot;North Star&quot;. That track, which was a tribute to Johnny Cash, has not yet surfaced officially or unofficially in any form. A song introduced by Bono as &quot;North Star&quot; was played in Turin during the U2 360° Tour; however, it is unknown whether or not this is the same song that was worked on during the sessions. Other tracks, such as &quot;Shark Soup&quot; (another version of &quot;Vertigo&quot;), &quot;Lead Me in the Way I Should Go&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Give Away Your Heart&quot;, were referenced in the media and by the band themselves, but have not been released.

The very earliest versions of &quot;Love and Peace or Else&quot; originated during the recording sessions for &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;. It serves as &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot;″s &quot;big plea for peace&quot; song, following in the footsteps of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;, &quot;Please&quot;, and &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;. During performances on the Vertigo Tour, &quot;Love and Peace Or Else&quot; featured Mullen moving out to the center of the ellipse-shaped ramp, where he played a floor tom and crash cymbal for the majority of the song. Near the end, Bono took over and played the drum until the song segued into the opening drumbeat of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. Most live performances of the song also saw Mullen singing the &quot;release, release, release, release&quot; part during the chorus alongside Bono.

&quot;Crumbs from Your Table&quot; is about the relationship between Western countries and developing countries. The verses and chorus address the relationship from the perspective of citizens from the developing world, focusing on the disparity between the long-term socioeconomic planning stressed by the West (&quot;You speak in signs and wonders&quot;) and the developing world&#x27;s immediate need for sustenance (&quot;But I&#x27;m begging for the crumbs from your table&quot;). One line (&quot;You speak in signs and wonders&quot;) was meant as a criticism of the Catholic Church. The bridge (&quot;Where you live should not decide / Whether you live or whether you die&quot;) is statement from Bono that follows with the theme in his speeches in which he tries to raise awareness about African poverty. Bono stated on a bonus DVD included with special editions of the album that the band has no recollection of writing the song, as they were intoxicated at the time. A studio performance is also included on the aforementioned bonus DVD. It was only played a handful on times during the third leg of the Vertigo Tour.

&quot;One Step Closer&quot; is a slow tempo song, with Bono&#x27;s lyrics centered around traffic images, leading to the singer being stranded on a refuge island. The origins of the song go back to the &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; sessions. It was revived for &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot;, with Lanois introducing a pedal steel guitar, in addition to guitars from the Edge and Bono, and musical influences varying from country music to The Velvet Underground making themselves felt. One recording of the song ran for more than 15 minutes, with Bono adding many verses that were subsequently dropped. Jacknife Lee also contributed to the final form of the recording. &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is billed in the album with thanks to Noel Gallagher of Oasis. The title of the song comes from a conversation Bono had with Gallagher about Bono&#x27;s dying father, Bob Hewson. Bono asked, &quot;Do you think he believes in God?&quot; to which Gallagher replied, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s one step closer to knowing.&quot; Through the end of the Vertigo Tour, the song had never been performed in any U2 concert. The title of the album derives from a lyric in the song &quot;Fast Cars&quot;, which was only available on some versions of the album.

==Promotion==

For the album release, U2 partnered with Apple Inc. for several cross-promotions. &quot;Vertigo&quot; was featured on a widely aired television advertisement for the company&#x27;s iPod music player. Additionally, a special edition U2-branded iPod was released bearing the black and red color scheme of the album, as well as laser-engraved autographs of each member on the back. &quot;The Complete U2&quot;, an iTunes Store-exclusive box set featuring 448 tracks, including previously unreleased content was also released. Proceeds from the iPod and iTunes partnerships were donated to charity. A live version of &quot;Original of the Species&quot; from the concert film &quot;Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago&quot; was later featured in commercials for the video iPod. Several CD copies of the album have the message &quot;Miss You Sugar&quot; on the bottom of the CD near the matrix number.

The compilation &quot;Medium, Rare &amp; Remastered&quot; and the EP &quot;Unreleased and Rare&quot;, included in &quot;The Complete U2&quot; box set, contains previously unreleased tracks, six of which were from the recording sessions for &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;:

# &quot;Xanax and Wine&quot; (alternate early version of &quot;Fast Cars&quot;)
# &quot;Native Son&quot; (alternate early version of &quot;Vertigo&quot;)
# &quot;Smile&quot; (outtake from the &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; Sessions)
# &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot; (early version)
# &quot;All Because of You&quot; (alternate version)
# &quot;Yahweh&quot; (alternate mix by Chris Thomas)

U2 made various promotional appearances on television. On 20 November 2004, U2 appeared as the musical guests on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, and &quot;I Will Follow&quot;. Two days later, on the day of the album&#x27;s release, U2 performed on a flat-bed truck, which drove through much of downtown New York City. Footage of the flat-bed performance was used for the music video of &quot;All Because of You&quot;. The drive ended at the Brooklyn Bridge, under which the band performed a &quot;secret gig&quot; in Empire Fulton Ferry State Park. Part of the concert was broadcast in an MTV television programme and released in the EP &quot;Live from Under the Brooklyn Bridge&quot;.

===Singles===
The album was preceded by the lead single &quot;Vertigo&quot;, which was released on 24 September 2004. The song topped the charts in several countries, including the UK, reached number 31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also topped the digital downloads chart in both the US and the UK, becoming U2&#x27;s best-selling digital single ever in the US, with 2× Platinum status (note that for downloads, Platinum status was obtained at 200,000 copies sold). Upon release the song received extensive airplay and was an international hit, being featured in a popular iPod television commercial. The song lent its namesake to the band&#x27;s Vertigo Tour.

The second single in the UK was &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, released on 7 February 2005. The song is about Bono&#x27;s relationship with his dying father. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming U2&#x27;s first-ever follow-up single to top the charts. On US adult contemporary radio, it reached number 15 on the Adult Top 40 and also appeared on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the Pop 100, and the Hot 100.

&quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; was the third UK release. It peaked at number 2 and spent nine weeks on the chart. It also placed on the US Adult Top 40.

The second single in the US was &quot;All Because of You&quot;. Although it received some airplay on rock radio, reaching number 6 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 20 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, the song had little mainstream exposure. When released in the UK, it peaked at number 4 but only spent four weeks on the chart.

&quot;Original of the Species&quot; was released as a promotional single in the US. It peaked at number 6 on the Triple A Chart according to mediaguide.com and the video has reached number 12 on VH1&#x27;s top 20 video countdown. The track has also made brief appearances on the Hot AC charts according to Radio and Records and MediaGuide.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
&quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from critics, the album received an average score of 79 based on 26 reviews. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;grandiose music from grandiose men, sweatlessly confident in the execution of their duties&quot;, believing the album was well served by not tamping down Bono&#x27;s ego or ambitions. Sheffield praised &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, calling it &quot;a reminder that what makes U2 so big isn&#x27;t really their clever ideas, or even their intelligence – it&#x27;s the warmth that all too few rock stars have any idea how to turn into music&quot;. Johnny Davis of &quot;Q&quot; said that the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing &quot;makes this record&quot; with his &quot;arsenal of guitar noises that bring to mind a particularly impatient boy with a new box of indoor fireworks&quot;. Responding to Bono&#x27;s quote about the group wanting to stave off a decline, Davis said, &quot;They&#x27;ve succeeded in not becoming crap quite admirably.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the album &quot;triumphant&quot;, praising U2&#x27;s &quot;journey from adolescence to maturity&quot; over their career as one that few groups could make &quot;with their creative vision so fully intact&quot;. He said that Bono lyrically &quot;explores epic themes, from faith to family, with such indelible grace that the CD stands with &#x27;The Joshua Tree&#x27; and &#x27;Achtung Baby&#x27; as one of the Irish quartet&#x27;s essential works&quot;. Dan Martin of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a classic U2 album, but also a breathtakingly modern heavy fucker&quot;, adding that &quot;Bono&#x27;s genius is that his inner monologue is so huge and heroic that it matches the scale of the music&quot;. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it a &quot;nakedly honest, uplifting album&quot; and their most personal one since &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. He called it &quot;a joy to see the group rekindle its shimmering &#x27;80s guitar-pop sound&quot; and was encouraged that their music &quot;comes so strongly from the gut once again, without the latest techno-experimental production techniques.&quot; Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; called the album a &quot;&quot;tour de force&quot; of tune and mood&quot;, adding, &quot;because U2&#x27;s sound has come to signify an open heart... it nearly always feels fresh, the way a new flame does&quot;. She thought that Bono lyrically &quot;wields sentimentality like a switchblade&quot; but also said that &quot;U2&#x27;s music is so broad and welcoming it can express ardor equally well for Christ, wives, supermodels, children or Bishop Desmond Tutu&quot;.

Stephen Troussé of &quot;Uncut&quot; called it &quot;their most unabashedly strident record since &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;&quot; and said that songs such as &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; and &quot;All Because of You&quot; gave &quot;the sense of a band flexing muscles they haven&#x27;t used in years&quot;. He remarked about the melancholic undertow of Bono&#x27;s lyrics, believing that the &quot;lines that stay with you speak of a creeping malaise&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the album &quot;may be unadventurous and melodramatic, but it is packed with disarming moments&quot;. He thought the group had embraced the clichéd elements of their 1980s music but said, &quot;Driven by a ferociously powerful rhythm section, U2 sound pleasingly raw, particularly next to the current wave of stadium rock pretenders&quot;. He lamented the abandonment of their 1990s experimentation, but appreciated their retention of self-awareness, concluding, &quot;it seems highly unlikely anyone will laugh at U2 again&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; questioned U2&#x27;s motivations for back-pedaling musically but called them &quot;one of the few remaining bands who can make pop-chart lust work for them, as &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; intermittently demonstrates&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that the record &quot;marks a retreat from innovation and daring, and re-immerses the Irish quartet in the comfort zone of its earliest successes&quot;. He believed the band had &quot;settl[ed] into middle age by recycling its best riffs and ideas&quot; and that those musical ideas were &quot;destined to pale in coming years as second-hand versions of those classic albums&quot;. Amanda Petrusich of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the record &quot;brash, grungy, and loud&quot; but not &quot;especially surprising&quot;, judging it to contain a &quot;tiny handful of outstanding tracks and a whole mess of schmaltzy filler&quot;. She criticised Bono&#x27;s &quot;vague, cliched observations, his sentiments always awkwardly bombastic or hopelessly maudlin&quot; and thought the album&#x27;s biggest issue was &quot;that it sounds so much like U2&quot;. Keith Harris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said that the lyrics were marred by &quot;legions of rampant clichés&quot; and that the album&#x27;s producers &quot;simply construct a U2 album in miniature, mixing in the Edge&#x27;s processed-guitar trademark whenever you fear they&#x27;re straying into unforgivable un-U2ness. That&#x27;s just not enough.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Following its 22 November 2004 release, &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; reached number one in 34 countries. In the US, the album debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 840,000 copies, setting a new personal best for the group; it was nearly double their previous mark set by &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, which sold 428,000 copies in its first week. It also debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts. The album has sold 9 million copies worldwide. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album sold 3.3 million copies in the US through March 2014.

===Accolades===
&quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; was rated the best album of 2004 by &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it the second-best album of the year, and it was ranked fourth respectively by &quot;Q&quot; in its list of the best albums of the year. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; rated it the eighth-best album of 2004, while &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked it 25th. It was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Top 50 Albums of 2004.

&quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; and its songs won eight Grammy Awards overall in 2005 and 2006, sweeping all of the categories in which they were nominated. In 2005, &quot;Vertigo&quot; won in three categories: Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Short Form Music Video. In 2006, &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot; was awarded Song of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; was awarded Best Rock Song, and &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; won for Best Rock Album and Album of the Year. The album producer&#x27;s Steve Lillywhite was also awarded Producer of the Year, Non Classical in 2006.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it the 68th-best album of the decade, while &quot;Vertigo&quot; was ranked the 64th-best song. Despite all of the critical acclaim for the album, Bono would later state that &quot;[t]here are no weak songs. But as an album, the whole isn&#x27;t greater than the sum of its parts, and it fucking annoys me.&quot;

==Vertigo Tour==
In support of the album, U2 launched the Vertigo Tour, which featured five legs and a total of 131 shows. The first and third legs featured indoor concerts in North America, while the second and fourth legs featured outdoor concerts in Europe, Mexico and South America, respectively. The final leg, which saw the band touring the Pacific, was delayed due to an illness suffered by The Edge&#x27;s daughter Sian. The stage design of the indoor Vertigo Tour shows was a stripped-down, intimate affair for the fans and featured an ellipse-shaped B-stage extending from the main stage. In total, the Vertigo Tour earned $389 million from 4.62 million tickets sold, the second-highest gross for any tour at the time. Three concert films depicting the tour, &quot;Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;U2 3D&quot;, were recorded.

==20th anniversary remastered edition==
On 26 September 2024, U2 announced that &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; would be reissued to commemorate its 20th anniversary. As part of the project, the album was remastered and was released on vinyl, CD, cassette tape, and digitally.

The group also released what they referred to as a &quot;shadow album&quot; called How to Re-Assemble an Atomic Bomb, comprising 10 songs unearthed from the recording sessions. The collection includes the track &quot;Luckiest Man in the World&quot;, which was leaked onto the internet under the working title &quot;Mercy&quot; 20 years prior. Three songs from the collection, &quot;Country Mile&quot;, &quot;Picture of You (X+W)&quot;, and &quot;Happiness&quot;, were released as promotional singles.

<doc id="986788" wikidata="Q3301991" url="?curid=986788" title="Hurricane Diane">
<text>Hurricane Diane was the first Atlantic hurricane to cause more than an estimated $1 billion in damage (in 1955 dollars, which would be $11,764,962,686 today), including direct costs and the loss of business and personal revenue. It formed on August 7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to strengthen rapidly after turning to the north-northeast. On August 12, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm on August 17, just five days after Hurricane Connie struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the United States Weather Bureau noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming extratropical two days later and completely dissipating by August 23.

The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, a process known as orographic lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.

Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state&#x27;s largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 New England Hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. In the hurricane&#x27;s wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Diane originated in a tropical wave first observed as a tropical depression on August 7 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The system moved generally to the west-northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 9. By the time the Weather Bureau first classified the storm on August 10, Diane was south of the Bermuda high, a semi-permanent ridge in the jet stream just east of Nova Scotia. Ships in the region of the storm reported winds of . During the next day, the Hurricane Hunters reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized. The storm interacted with Hurricane Connie to its northwest in a process known as the Fujiwhara effect, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a cold-core low that increased atmospheric instability. On August 12, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in barometric pressure, despite moving away from the hurricane.

At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined eye about in diameter, described by reconnaissance aircraft as taking the shape of an &quot;inverted teacup&quot;. The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located northeast of the eye. After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on August 13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of , and peak winds of 105 mph (170 km/h); originally the hurricane was analyzed to reach peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), although the large size and slow forward speed suggested the lower winds. It maintained its peak winds for about 12 hours, after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By August 15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955. On August 17, Diane made landfall on the coast of North Carolina near Wilmington. Pressure at landfall was estimated at , accompanied by winds just under hurricane intensity. Diane struck the state only five days after Hurricane Connie struck the same general area.

Diane quickly weakened as a tropical storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center to the north and northeast. The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact much with the non-tropical westerlies, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the Mid-Atlantic states, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of New England, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 21. Passing south and east of Newfoundland, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland.
==Preparations and background==

Late on August 14, more than two days before Diane made landfall, the United States Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert from Georgia through North Carolina. On August 15, the agency issued a hurricane warning from Brunswick, Georgia to Wilmington, North Carolina, although the warning was later extended to the south and north to Fernandina, Florida and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, respectively. The agency also issued storm warnings southward to Saint Augustine, Florida and northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey, including the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. Throughout the warned region, small ships were advised to remain at port. Before Diane made landfall, the North Carolina National Guard assisted in evacuating people near the Pamlico River, and 700 residents left their homes near New Bern; thousands of tourists also evacuated. The threat of the hurricane forced the planned retirement ceremony for Admiral Robert Carney to be transferred from an aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Virginia to an academy dormitory. All aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were flown to safer locations further inland.

All hurricane warnings were dropped after Diane moved inland. Forecasters downplayed the threat of Diane after it weakened over Virginia; the Weather Bureau agreed they did not foresee the extent of the rain that would occur, instead calling for just &quot;some local flooding&quot;. The agency later admitted they &quot;goofed&quot; in downplaying the storm&#x27;s destructive potential after weakening, noting their lack of experience with extreme rainfall events. Once the storm moved ashore, the Weather Bureau transferred official forecasting duties to regional offices, and local newspapers also issued their own forecasts. The Springfield Daily News in Massachusetts noted that &quot;moderate rains [were] possible&quot; in its daily weather forecast ahead of the storm. Still, flood warnings were issued, with stream flooding forecasts of over 12 hours in advance. Along smaller rivers, including the Lehigh, Schuylkill, and Farmington, forecasts were issued every few hours.

In the summer of 1955, the eastern United States experienced generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was in contrast to the federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.

==Impact==
Hurricane Diane&#x27;s path over the eastern United States brought heavy rainfall, fueled by unusually moist air resulting from abnormally high sea surface temperatures. The worst flooding was in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, and southern New England. Of the 287 stream gauges in the region, 129 reported record levels during the course of the event. Many streams reported discharge rates of more than double the previous records. Most of the flooding occurred along small rivers that rose to flood stage within hours, largely impacting populated areas; there were around 30 million people in the region affected by the floods. Overall, 813 houses were destroyed, with 14,000 heavily damaged. The storms damage caused over 35,000 families to re locate. The floods also severed infrastructure and affected several summer camps. Damage to public utilities was estimated at $79 million. Flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains, while destroyed crops cost an estimated $7 million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82 million in damage. Damage from Diane&#x27;s winds were generally minor. The hurricane caused $831.7 million in damage, of which $600 million was in New England, making it the costliest hurricane in American history at the time. Taking into account indirect losses, such as loss of wages and business earnings, Diane was described as &quot;the first billion dollar hurricane.&quot; This contributed to 1955 being the costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record at the time. Overall, there were at least 184 deaths, potentially as many as 200.

===Carolinas===
The strongest sustained winds associated with Diane&#x27;s landfall in North Carolina reached in Hatteras, with gusts to in Wilmington. Any hurricane-force gusts were likely very sporadic and isolated in nature. Tides ran above normal near Wilmington, and waves in height struck the coast. The resultant storm surge damaged beach houses, flooded coastal roads, and destroyed seawalls damaged by Hurricane Connie a few days prior. The center of the storm passed over Wilmington without much of a decrease in winds, suggesting the eye had largely dissipated in the weakening tropical cyclone. Little precipitation fell in and around the city, though precipitation was more substantial elsewhere in the state, peaking at in New Bern. At Oakway in neighboring South Carolina, rainfall amounted to .

===Mid-Atlantic===

After Diane crossed into Virginia, it dropped heavy rainfall of over in 24 hours in the Blue Ridge Mountains, peaking at in Big Meadows. There, the rains were enhanced by moist air rising over the mountain peaks and condensing, a process known as orographic lift. Rainfall of over occurred throughout Virginia, as well as into the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, where was reported at Stony River Reservoir. Similar precipitation amounts fell through Delaware, including at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. Rivers across the region rose above flood stage, including the James River which crested at in Columbia, Virginia, which was above flood stage. High amounts of rainfall accrued in eastern Pennsylvania, peaking at in Pecks Pond in the northeast portion of the state. As with Virginia, the heaviest rainfall occurred due to orographic lift near a mountain. In neighboring New Jersey, the highest precipitation was near Sussex. Rainfall in New York peaked at in Lake Mohonk.

In Virginia, severe flooding occurred near Richmond and along the Blue Ridge Mountains. Near the coast, Diane damaged large areas of farmlands due to slow-moving floods. In the state, 21 gauges reported their highest levels on record. High levels along the Potomac River flooded low-lying portions of Virginia and Washington, D.C. Wind gusts reached in Roanoke. In the state, flooding covered several roads, prompting closures. Due to the flat terrain, flooding in Delaware was described by the United States Geological Survey as &quot;comparably mild&quot;. Flooding along the Brandywine Creek was at least the fifth highest in 45 years. Flooding was worst in the northernmost portion of the state.

Flooding began in many streams in eastern Pennsylvania on August 18. The Delaware River crested at over in Easton, which was above the previous record set in 1903. In Allentown, the Lehigh River crested at , surpassing the previous record of set in 1942. The floods were the worst in record across eastern portions of the state, notably in the Poconos and along all tributaries of the Delaware River from Honesdale to Philadelphia. Lake Wallenpaupack and other reservoirs mitigated flooding. Floods destroyed 17 bridges and of track along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which is the primary rail line in northeastern Pennsylvania. Damage to the line totaled several million dollars, and overall railroad damage in the state totaled $16 million. Hundreds of cars were damaged in the region. Damage extended into Philadelphia due to flooding along the Schuylkill River, but the damage was minor. In the small village of Upper Black Eddy, hundreds of people became homeless, and the post office was washed away. Statewide, the floods destroyed or breached 30 dams, and destroyed about 150 road of rail bridges. Flooding left home and factory damage in the Allentown area. In the Poconos in Pennsylvania, the Brodhead Creek nearly destroyed a camp, killing 37 people, mostly children. Many people at the camp fled to a lodge that was ultimately destroyed. The Brodhead Creek also washed out a bridge along U.S. Route 209 between Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg, flooding both cities. There were about 75 deaths in the area, and another 10 deaths occurred in Greentown due to flooding along the Lackawaxen River. Overall, there were 101 deaths in the state, and damage totaled at least $70 million.

In New Jersey, flooding largely occurred north of Trenton and west of Perth Amboy; rainfall in the southern two–thirds of the state was less than . The three major rivers in the area - the Delaware, Passaic, and Raritan - had severe flooding, and damage was widespread. When the Millstone River flooded, two teenagers drowned while canoeing, and a police officer drowned while attempting to rescue them. About 200 families were evacuated in Oakland along the Ramapo River. Damage in the state was heaviest along the Delaware from Port Jervis, New York to Trenton, where flooding inundated adjacent towns. Between the two towns, all but two bridges were damaged, including four that were destroyed. About 500 children had to be rescued from camps on three islands in the Delaware River; they were airlifted to a high school in Frenchtown. In that city, about 200 people were forced to evacuate their houses along the water. In Trenton, workers used sandbags to prevent flooding from affecting government buildings. Flooding destroyed the Portland–Columbia Pedestrian Bridge, first constructed in 1831, after most of it was submerged. The center of the Northampton Street Bridge between Easton, Pennsylvania and Phillipsburg, New Jersey collapsed. A dam near Branchville collapsed, flooding the town and causing heavy damage. About 200 homes were damaged or destroyed in Lambertville. Statewide, 93 homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $27.5 million.

Flash floods occurred in mountainous regions of southeastern New York, including Port Jervis along the Delaware River. Wappinger Creek flooded to cause heavy damage. Most streams in the Rondout Creek basin left damage due to fast-moving waters, including heavy damage near Ellenville. Damage in New York was largely limited to an area between Port Jervis and Poughkeepsie. Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2 million, and there was one death in the state.

===New England===
Diane produced heavy rainfall after recurving inland, setting rainfall records in several areas. Windsor Locks, Connecticut reported in a 23‑hour period; the station&#x27;s total, located near Hartford, was higher than the 24‑hour rainfall record in Hartford. Some locations along the Housatonic River experienced per hour over 24 hours. The highest total in the state was at a station near Torrington. This is the highest rainfall on record in the state. The highest rainfall in the United States related to the storm was in Westfield, Massachusetts, which was also the wettest known storm in the state&#x27;s history as well as throughout New England. Other statewide rainfall maxima in New England included in Greenville, Rhode Island, in Essex Junction, Vermont, in Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, and at Long Falls Dam in Maine. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, mostly in the region south of Worcester, Massachusetts. About 7,000 people were injured throughout New England, most of whom in Connecticut.

Damage was greatest in Connecticut, where floods affected about two-thirds of the state. It was the largest flood on record in the state&#x27;s history. All major streams and valleys were flooded during the storm, including hundreds of tributaries, and 30 gauges in the state reported the highest level on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached the third-highest level on record at the time, cresting at , or above flood stage. Although there was rural damage, the city of Hartford was spared from flooding due to previously constructed dykes. The Naugatuck River had significant flooding that damaged or destroyed every bridge across it and did extensive damage in Ansonia. In Waterbury, the river washed buildings and railroad girders into a bridge. In the city, 30 people were killed, including 26 in 13 houses that were washed away in one block. The Quinebaug River flooded the city of Putnam at the same time that a major fire originated at a magnesium plant. Much of the commercial district of Winsted was destroyed by the Mad River, which reached deep; the floods destroyed most buildings on the south side of the town&#x27;s Main Street, and carried away several cars from a car dealership. The local newspaper reported that 95% of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in Winsted. High rivers destroyed historical sites and buildings, and statewide Diane destroyed 563 houses. There were 77 deaths in the state and $350 million in damage. Most of the damage in the state was industrial or commercial damage.

In Rhode Island, flooding was worst in the northern portion of the state, mostly along the Blackstone River, which expanded to a width of about . The Horseshoe Dam was washed out, causing heavy damage in Woonsocket. There, about 6,000 of its 50,000 residents were left unemployed. Record high tides were also reported. In Rhode Island, damage was estimated at $21 million, mostly in Woonsocket, and there were three deaths.

Much of southern Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester and to the ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24 stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% of the city of Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340 ft³/s (236 m³/s), which was 6.2 times greater than the previous peak and 28.5 times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97 houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110 million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12 deaths in the state.
==Aftermath==

In Diane&#x27;s immediate aftermath, one of the first priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000 people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10 million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.

President Dwight Eisenhower declared eight states as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The Small Business Administration opened 18 temporary offices in the eastern United States for people to take out disaster loan applications. In the months after the storm, both the United States federal government and the American Red Cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims; collectively, the Red Cross, the Small Business Administration, and Farmers Home Administration raised $37 million, which was less than 8% of Diane&#x27;s damage total. Throughout 1955, the Red Cross assisted about 10,000 families in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states; some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a flood zone. The Small Business Administration provided about 1,600 loans, totaling $25 million, for small businesses. Senator Herbert H. Lehman proposed a $12 billion federal flood insurance program. In 1956, the United States Congress passed the Federal Flood Insurance Act, but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding. A nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. After the floods from Diane, the American federal government provided funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to construct dams and reservoirs throughout New England to mitigate future flooding. In about 14 years, the Corps built 29 dams in Connecticut alone at the cost of $70 million, including three along the Connecticut River. The federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the Delaware River, one of which along Tocks Island. A controversy arose there due to the long reservoir the dam would have created, causing 600 families to be displaced. The project was canceled in 1975, and the acquired lands became the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.

In Pennsylvania, washed-out rail lines prevented operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, and the loss of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235 people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15 industrial plants, which left more than 15,000 people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton declared a state of emergency due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1 penny, totaled $71 million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm&#x27;s aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state&#x27;s worst natural disaster.

After the Naugatuck River flood in Connecticut cut off communications and bridges, the state was effectively cut in two. The state&#x27;s National Guard used helicopters to rescue people. Governor Abraham A. Ribicoff visited areas affected by the flooding, due to the damage, Connecticut was declared a federal disaster area on August 20. The declaration allocated $25 million in assistance to the state. Governor Ribicoff requested $34 million in funds to rebuild and produce future flood mitigation projects; the state&#x27;s funding was paid by a combination of bonds and tax increases. Including subsequent storms, the 1955 floods cumulatively killed 91 people and left 1,100 families homeless. Flooding occurred in 67 towns, resulting in damage to 20,000 families. About 86,000 people were left unemployed after the floods. In Winsted, the buildings that were washed away along the south side of Main Street were never rebuilt.

Massachusetts Governor Christian Herter also issued a state of emergency, due to the widespread flooding damage. As a result, the state&#x27;s National Guard and the Army Corps assisted in cleanup, and most roads took three weeks to clear. Residents in areas affected by Diane&#x27;s flooding were advised to boil water and not to use gas cooking equipment. Diane&#x27;s historic rainfall resulted in the wettest month on record in Boston with a total of , a record that stands as of 2010; Boston&#x27;s 24‑hour total of remained the highest daily total as of 1996. Following Diane&#x27;s floods, cities in Massachusetts enlarged culverts and improved draining systems, as well as constructing weirs; these systems helped mitigate against future flooding.

Using a monetary deflator in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane would be about $7.4 billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States. Accounting for inflation, changes in personal wealth, and population changes, it is estimated Diane would have caused $18 billion in damage in 2010, or the 15th highest for a United States hurricane.

Spurred by the impacts of the several major hurricanes along the U.S. Atlantic seaboard in 1954 and 1955, including Diane, the U.S.Congress authorized funding for the United States Weather Bureau to establish the National Hurricane Research Project to conduct research into hurricanes and hurricane forecasting. Out of this grew the National Hurricane Center in 1956.

=== Retirement ===
On account of the extensive damage and high death toll, the name &quot;Diane&quot; was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau after the 1955 season. The name will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone.

<text>Pelusium (Ancient Egyptian: ; /, , or , ; ; ; ; ) was an important city in the eastern extremes of Egypt&#x27;s Nile Delta, to the southeast of the modern Port Said. It became a Roman provincial capital and Metropolitan archbishopric and remained a multiple Catholic titular see and an Eastern Orthodox active archdiocese.

== Location ==
Pelusium lay between the seaboard and the marshes of the Nile Delta, about two-and-a-half miles from the sea. The port was choked by sand as early as the first century BC, and the coastline has now advanced far beyond its ancient limits that the city, even in the third century AD, was at least four miles from the Mediterranean.

The principal product of the neighbouring lands was flax, and the &quot;linum Pelusiacum&quot; (Pliny&#x27;s Natural History xix. 1. s. 3) was both abundant and of a very fine quality. Pelusium was also known for being an early producer of beer, known as the Pelusian drink. Pelusium stood as a border-fortress, a place of great strength, on the frontier, protecting Egypt as regards to Syria and the sea. Thus, from its position, it was directly exposed to attack by any invaders of Egypt; it was often besieged, and several important battles were fought around its walls.

== Names and identity ==
Pelusium was the easternmost major city of Lower Egypt, situated upon the easternmost bank of the Nile, the &quot;Ostium Pelusiacum&quot;, to which it gave its name. Pliny the Elder gives its location in relation to the frontier of Arabia: &quot;At Ras Straki, 65 miles from Pelusium, is the frontier of Arabia. Then begins Idumaea, and Palestine at the point where the Serbonian Lake comes into view. This lake... is now an inconsiderable fen.&quot;

The Roman name &quot;Pelusium&quot; was derived from the Koine Greek name, and the Greek from a translation of the Egyptian one. It was variously known as Sena and Per-Amun (Late Egyptian and Coptic: &quot;Peremoun&quot;) &quot;House or Temple of the sun god Amun&quot;, Pelousion or Saien (), Imperial Aramaic and , and Egyptian Arabic Tell el-Farama). According to William Smith, it was the &quot;Sin&quot; of the Hebrew Bible in Ezekiel 30:15. Smith surmised that the word in its Egyptian and Greek forms (&quot;Peremoun&quot; or &quot;Peromi&quot;; &quot;Pelos&quot;) had the connotation of a &#x27;city made of mud&#x27; (&quot;omi&quot;, Coptic, &quot;mud&quot;).

The anonymous author of the Aramaic Palestinian Targum translated the word &quot;Rameses&quot; in the Pentateuch as meaning &quot;Pelusin&quot; (Pelusium). It is not certain whether or not the 10th-century rabbi and scholar Saadia Gaon agreed with that determination, although he possessed another tradition of later making, writing that &quot;Rameses&quot; mentioned in Numbers 33:3, and in Exodus 1:11 and 12:37, as also in Genesis 47:11, refers to Ain Shams. Modern-day historical geographers associate ʻAin Shams with Heliopolis.

According to the 1st-century historian Josephus, Pelusium was situated on one of the mouths of the Nile.

== History ==

The following are the most notable events in the history of Pelusium :
* Sennacherib, the Neo-Assyrian emperor, 720-715 BC, in the reign of Sethos the Aethiopian of the 25th Dynasty of Egypt, advanced from the Kingdom of Judah upon Pelusium, but retired without fighting from before its walls in Isaiah 31:8; Herodotus ii. 141; Strabo xiii. p. 604. His retreat was ascribed to the favor of Hephaestos towards Sethos, his priest. In the night, while the Assyrians slept, a host of field mice gnawed their bow-strings and shield-straps, who fled, and many of them were slain in their flight by the Egyptians. Herodotus saw in the temple of Hephaestos at Memphis, a record of this victory of the Egyptians: a statue of Sethos holding a mouse in his hand. The story probably rests on the fact that in the symbolism of Egypt, the mouse implied destruction. (Compare Horapolis &quot;Hieroglyph.&quot; i. 50; Claudius Aelianus, &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot; vi. 41.)
* The decisive Battle of Pelusium (525 BC) which transferred the throne of the Pharaohs to Cambyses II, king of the Persians, was fought near Pelusium. The fields around were strewn with the bones of the combatants when Herodotus visited. He noted that the skulls of the Egyptians were distinguishable from those of the Persians by their superior hardness, a fact confirmed he said by the mummies. He ascribed this to the Egyptians&#x27; shaving their heads from infancy, and to the Persians covering them up with folds of cloth or linen. (Herodotus ii. 10, seq.); however, according to legend, Pelusium fell without a fight, by the simple expedient of having the invading army drive cats (sacred to the local goddess Bast) before them. As Cambyses advanced at once to Memphis, Pelusium probably surrendered itself immediately after the battle. (Polyaen. &quot;Stratag.&quot; vii. 9.)
* In 373 BC, Pharnabazus, satrap of Phrygia, and Iphicrates, the commander of the Athenian armament, appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, Nectanebo I, king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighboring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. (Diodorus Siculus xv. 42; Cornelius Nepos, &quot;Iphicrates&quot; c. 5.)
* Pelusium was attacked and taken by the Persians, c. 340 BC. The city contained at the time a garrison of 5,000 Greek mercenaries under the command of Philophron. At first, owing to the rashness of the Thebans in the Persian service, the defenders had the advantage. But the Egyptian king Nectanebo II hastily venturing on a pitched battle, his troops were cut to pieces, and Pelusium surrendered to the Theban general Lacrates on honorable conditions. (Diodorus Siculus xvi. 43.)
* In 333 BC, Pelusium opened its gates to Alexander the Great, who placed a garrison in it under the command of one of those officers entitled Companions of the King. (Arrian, &quot;Exp. Alex.&quot; iii. 1, seq.; Quintus Curtius iv. 33.)
* In 173 BC, Antiochus Epiphanes utterly defeated the troops of Ptolemy Philometor under the walls of Pelusium, which he took and retained after he had retired from the rest of Egypt. (Polybius &quot;Legat.&quot; § 82; Hieronym. &quot;in Daniel.&quot; xi.) On the fall of the Syrian kingdom, however, if not earlier, Pelusium had been restored to the Ptolemies.
* In 55 BC, again belonging to Egypt, Mark Antony, as cavalry commander to the Roman proconsul Gabinius, defeated the Egyptian army, and made himself master of the city. Ptolemy Auletes, in whose behalf the Romans invaded Egypt at this time, wished to put the Pelusians to the sword; but his intention was thwarted by Mark Anthony. (Plut. &quot;Anton.&quot; c. 3; Valerius Max. ix. 1.)
* In 48 BC, Pompey was murdered near Pelusium.
* In 47 BC, Mithridates of Pergamon stormed and took Pelusium on his way to reinforce Caesar who was being besieged in Alexandria.
* In 30 BC, more than half a year after his victory at Actium, Augustus appeared before Pelusium, and was admitted by its governor Seleucus within its walls.
* In 115-117 AD, during the Diaspora Revolt, the Jews are said to have taken control of the waterways near Pelusium.
* In 501 AD, Pelusium suffered greatly from the Persian invasion of Egypt (Eutychius, Annal.).
* In 541 AD, the Plague of Justinian was first reported and began to spread across the Byzantine Empire.
* In 639, Pelusium offered a protracted, though, in the end, an ineffectual resistance to the arms of Amr ibn al-As. As on former occasions, the surrender of the key of the Delta was nearly equivalent to the subjugation of Egypt itself.
* In 749, Pelusium was raided by the Bashmuric Copts.
* In ca. 870, Pelusium is mentioned as a major port in the trade network of the Radhanite merchants.
* In 1118, Baldwin I of Jerusalem razed the city to the ground, but died shortly afterwards of food poisoning after eating a plateful of the local fish.

The sultans who ruled Pelusium following the Crusades, however, generally neglected the harbors, and from that period Pelusium, which had long been on the decline, almost disappeared from history.

== Archaeological research ==
The first excavations in Pelusium started in 1910 and were conducted by French Egyptologist Jean Cledat, who also drew the plan of the whole site. In the 1980s, work was carried out by Egyptian researchers directed by Mohammed Abd El-Maksoud as well as French linguist and historian Jean-Yves Carrez-Maratray. The Egyptian expedition uncovered Roman baths with mosaics, dated to the 3rd century. Due to the planned construction of the Peace Canal, which was to cross the site, salvage excavations were commenced in 1991. Each of the several institutions from all over the world which took part in the project was assigned its sector in the area of Pelusium and its vicinity, i.e., the so-called Greater Pelusium. The Egyptian team explored the Roman theatre and the Byzantine basilica; the Swiss carried out a survey; the British worked in the southern part of the site, and the Canadian in the western. From 2003 to 2009, an expedition from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw conducted research in the so-called Great Theater from the 2nd/3rd century and residential buildings of a later date. The Polish-Egyptian team also carried out restoration and reconstruction works in the theater.

In 2019, besides the main streets of Pelusium city, a 2,500-square-metre Graeco-Roman building made of red brick and limestone was revealed by the Egyptian archeological mission. Interior design of the building contained the remnants of three 60 cm-thick circular benches. According to archaeologist Mostafa Waziri, the building was very likely used to hold meetings for the citizens′ representatives or headquarters for the Senate Council of Pelusium.

In 2022 archaeologists found the remains of a temple of Zeus-Kasios. Researchers knew about the temple, since in early 1900 Jean Cledat had found Greek inscriptions that showed the existence of the temple, but this was the first time that ruins of the temple were found.

== Roman military roads ==
Of the six military roads formed or adopted by the Romans in Egypt, the following are mentioned in the Itinerarium of Antoninus as connected with Pelusium:
* From Memphis to Pelusium. This road joined the great road from Pselcis in Nubia at Babylon, nearly opposite Memphis, and coincided with it as far as Scenae Veteranorum. The two roads, &quot;viz.&quot; that from Pselcis to Scenae Veteranorum, which turned off to the east at Heliopolis, and that from Memphis to Pelusium, connected the latter city with the capital of Lower Egypt, Trajan&#x27;s canal, and Arsinoe, near Suez, on the Sinus Heroopolites (modern Gulf of Suez).
* From Acca to Alexandria, ran along the Mediterranean Sea from Raphia to Pelusium.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Pelusium is named (as &quot;Sin, the strength of Egypt&quot;) in the Biblical Book of Ezekiel, chapter 30:15.

Pelusium became the seat of a Christian bishop at an early stage. Its bishop Dorotheus took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325. In 335, Marcus was exiled because of his support for Athanasius of Alexandria. His replacement Pancratius, an exponent of Arianism, was at the Second Council of Sirmium in 351. Several of the succeeding known bishops of Pelusium were also considered heretical by the orthodox. As the capital of the Roman province of Augustamnica Prima, Pelusium was ecclesiastically the metropolitan see of the province.

Pelusium is still the seat of a metropolitan bishopric of the modern-day Eastern Orthodox Church.

Isidore of Pelusium (d. c.450), who was born in Alexandria, became an ascetic and settled on a mountain near Pelusium, in the tradition of the Desert Fathers.

Pelusium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a Metropolitan titular archbishopric both in the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Melkite Catholic Church.

<text>Chieli Minucci (born April 17, 1958) is an American guitarist who co-founded the band Special EFX.

==Career==
His father, Ulpio Minucci, was a concert pianist and composer who wrote the music to the 1955 song &quot;Domani.&quot;

Chieli Minucci started Special EFX in 1982 with George Jinda, a drummer from Hungary. The band combined rock, Latin rhythm, and smooth jazz. When the duo separated in 1995, Jinda continued to perform under the name Special EFX. After Jinda&#x27;s death in 2001, Minucci performed under the name Chieli Minucci and Special EFX. He recorded albums as a solo act, beginning in 1994 with &quot;Jewels&quot;. He has worked as a record producer and composer for Deborah Henson-Conant and Kim Pensyl, and as a sideman for Angela Bofill, Roberta Flack, Chaka Khan, Noel Pointer and Roseanna Vitro.

<text>The University of Macedonia (UoM; , ΠΑΜΑΚ, &quot;Panepistímio Makedonías&quot;, PAMAK) is a public research university in Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.

Founded as School of Higher Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki (in Greek: Ανώτατη Βιομηχανική Σχολή Θεσσαλονίκης) in 1948 and started its first operation during the academic year 1957–1958, it is the second largest university in the city (following the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki). It currently consists of eight departments which deal mainly with social, political, economic sciences and Information Technology.

The language of instruction is Greek, although there are programs in foreign languages,courses both for international and local students, carried out in English, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Georgian, Albanian, Hebrew, Romanian and Arabic.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

In 1930 the evening Business School is founded by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Thessaloniki which can be considered the antecedent of the Graduate School of Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki. In 1948 the three-year Graduate School of Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki is founded in accordance with Emergency Law 800/1948 as a legal entity governed by private law under the authority of the Ministry of National Economy.

In 1954 the first Council of the Graduate School of Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki is established under the Ministerial Decree 70139/15-1-1954 of the minister Director- General of Northern Greece. In 1956 the &quot;Internal Rules of Procedure of the Graduate School of Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki&quot; got approved. The internal rules specify in detail all administrative and education matters for the organization of the School. One year later, the operation of the School starts with the admission of the first students. In 1958 the school is renamed as &quot;School of Higher Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki&quot;, attendance is for four years, &quot;the degree is equivalent to those provided by all four-year attendance Schools of Higher Education&quot;, operation is under the auspices of the Ministry of Industry. 4 years later, the School is governed by a Council appointed by the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs. Thus, the School operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. Specializations are introduced for the first time in the school&#x27;s curriculum. In 1966 the school is renamed as &quot;School of Higher Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki&quot; and it operates as a legal entity governed by private law. Until the issuance of the Royal Decrees provided for by the relevant Decree-Law, the School is temporarily governed by a five-member Senate. In 1973, the first PhDs are awarded. Shortly before the collapse of the dictatorship, the administrative bodies are established within the School. The school&#x27;s administration is now carried out by the Rector and the Senate.

=== Contemporary history ===
In 1985, the School is divided into two departments: the Department of Economics and the Department of Business Administration. In 1990 the School of Higher Industrial Studies of Thessaloniki is renamed to “University of Macedonia Economics and Social Sciences” and three new departments are founded: Department of International and European Economic Studies, Department of Accounting and Finance, Department of Applied Informatics. 8 years later, the first Department of Educational &amp; Social Policy is founded. The Department receives its first students in September 1997. In 1996, two new departments are founded: the Department of Balkan, Slavic and Oriental Studies, and the Department of Music Science and Art. Those new departments received their first students in September 1998. In 2004, two more decentralized departments are founded: The Department of Marketing and Operation Management based in the city of Edessa and the Department of Technology Management based in the city of Naousa.

In 2013, with the “Athena” reform plan the designation “Economics &amp; Social Studies” is removed from the University&#x27;s official title, the decentralized departments (in Naousa and Edessa) are merged with the departments based in Thessaloniki and for the first time Schools are founded.

<text>Guiraut Riquier de Narbona ( 1230 in Narbonne – 1292 in Narbonne or Rodez) is among the last of the Occitan troubadours. He is well known because of his great care in writing out his works and keeping them together—&quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; considers him an &quot;anthologist&quot; of his own works. Riquier is also remarkable for having introduced new genres and variants of existing ones, as in the pseudo-alba, the first example of the later serenade.

He served under Aimery IV, Viscount of Narbonne, as well as Alfonso el Sabio, King of Castile. He is also believed to have worked under Henry II, Count of Rodez. He composed a &quot;partimen&quot; with the Jewish troubadour Bonfilh. He invented the genre of the &quot;serena&quot; (evening song).

<doc id="986805" wikidata="Q5430976" url="?curid=986805" title="Fairy Meat">
<text>Fairy Meat is a warband-based tabletop game first published by Kenzer &amp; Company in 2000, written and designed by Sky Leaton and illustrated by Manny Vega. The game revolves around the battles of a pack (Circle) of vicious, cannibal fairies. Gameplay is conducted with 1:1 miniatures and a deck of cards.

==Story==
Long ago, fairies were peaceful, mischievous, happy-go-lucky creatures who spent most of their time dancing, playing, singing, and eating honey and fruit.

That all changed when a foolish fairy by the name of Merryzot decided to try eating the meat of a dead mouse. The never-before-tasted substance proved addictive, and soon all fairies, being as amoral as they are adventurous, were carving up all manner of flesh to discover the best tasting.

Eventually it was discovered that the best-tasting meat of all was the meat of the fairy, and their society was plunged into chaos as they devoured one another, with the old fairy nobility fleeing to the Moon and the Gnomic races (gnomes, leprechauns etc.) vanishing underground, acts that would come back to haunt the Woodland Fairies later.

Eventually the very essence of Fairydom was altered, and fairies, who spring into being fully grown from pods produced by amber drops in spring, were born addicted and hungering for the flesh of their fellows.

==Races==
The fairies of Fairy Meat are divided into a variety of sub-breeds, some of which form different Circles than others. The Circles are loyal bands that do not kill or eat their own members. The breeds of fairies are:

===Base game===

Woodland Fairies: these are the primary fairies the player uses, all that remains of a once enchanting culture. Divided into several sub-breeds named after various plants, Woodland Fairies are regarded as primitives by other fairy races. Their diet of fairy flesh apparently makes them incredibly strong (by fairy standards).

Glitter Fairies: a sub-breed of Woodland Fairy, these are the descendants of lesser fairy nobility and those fairy sorcerers who survived the downfall of fairy civilisation. In the game, these are weaker than normal Woodland Fairies but make up for by being able to use the Nasty (battle/offensive) and Nice (healing/defensive) branches of fairy magic.

===Clockwork Stomp===

Gnomes: After abandoning life alongside ancient humans and going underground to prepare for world domination, the gnomic races eventually fell to infighting, which resulted in the annihilation of all races bar two; the science-loving gnomes and the drunken, undead leprechauns. Gnomes have lost all of their former magical powers, but in return have developed incredible technological skill, including bionic body parts, chemical weapons and rocket launchers. The mad Leprechauns, having become zombies due to an addiction to alchemical shoe polish formula, are apparently easy prey for gnomes, as many gnome inventions are powered by leprechaun brew (blenderized leprechaun). Gnomes as a race seem to suffer from a Napoleon Complex, and are determined to one day conquer the surface. Though slower than fairies, their deadly weaponry and their cyborg slaves (the Clock-Fairies) make them a force to be reckoned with. Their racial enemies are the Gremlins, who live to destroy machinery. Gnomes, Gremlins and Clock-Fairies are detailed in &quot;Clockwork Stomp!&quot;, the first supplement for Fairy Meat.

Clock-Fairies: These twisted abominations are created by gnomes. A gnome must first assemble a fairy body of machinery, including rotor-like wings, which serve as a power source. Then he needs to catch a living fairy, cut its head off then graft it to the mechanical body. Though most Clock-Fairies work for gnomes, some do manage to go rogue, joining fairy circles to take revenge on their former masters.

===Sugar and Vice===

Moon Fairies: When a mysterious force threatened fairies at the onset of the Dark Ages, the nobility did what they do best - they ran away. In this case, they made it to the Moon before they finally stopped. There, the fairy culture survived and eventually evolved (or degenerated, depending on how you look at it) into a rock-and-roll obsessed civilisation. In recent years, the music-loving Moon Fairies returned to earth, only to find that in their absence the Woodland Fairies had become fierce cannibals, who refused to obey the descendants of the creeps who had left them to rot so long ago. Unable to match the strength that their former minions&#x27; cannibalistic diet gave them, the Moon Fairies developed a mystical lipstick called Pink, which allowed them to suck the life from another fairy and thus give them the opportunity to match their degenerate kinsfolk. Moon Fairies make no distinction between fighters and wizards, but their style of magic is different from earth Fae, being divided into Glamour and Glitz branches. Moon Fairies and their Beat Pixie minions are detailed in &quot;Sugar and Vice&quot;, the second Fairy Meat supplement.

Beat Pixies: Obnoxious things, Beat Pixies are possessed by a natural rhythm, which afflicts them with a kind of hyper-activity. Once they start moving, they can&#x27;t stop! In Moon Fairy society, Beat Pixies are drummers and front-line warriors, when they aren&#x27;t dancing crazily in the Mosh Pits.

===Wicked Things===

Wicked Things: This title is used to refer to the various types of fairy &#x27;converted&#x27; by black witches. Wicked Things consist of Bitter Fairies, who then progress to Gloom Fairies and then to Doom Fairies, the berserk Blood Fairies, devilish Cricken, the filthy and disease-loving Leperchauns (as in leperous Leprechauns), and Night Fairies, which are converted Glitter Fairies who now use all manner of cheesy incantations when they use their magic. &quot;Wicked Things&quot; are detailed in the sourcebook of the same name, the third supplement to Fairy Meat.

===WAR===

Straightedge Rebellion: Regarded as mentally-ill by the other fairies for their lack of happiness and forced to leave, these warlike fairies adopt a militaristic lifestyle. They avoid the entertainment and decorations other fairies use, and many of them also do not eat other fairies&#x27; meat, so they instead feed on a freely-given dew that regulates their emotions. Like the Gnomes they use more technologically-advanced weapons to kill all other fairies, whom they regard as cannibalistic abominations to be slaughtered. These were introduced in the &quot;WAR!&quot; supplement.

Feral Queens: Rogue Moon Fairy monarchs who went wild, ruling over tribes of Forest Fairies by threatening to kill and eat them to frighten them into submission.

==Reception==
The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; comments: &quot;The makers of &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; bring their sense of humor to the world of fairy-on-fairy battle in &quot;Fairy Meat&quot;, a fast-playing miniature war game. Designer Sky Leaton has created an entertaining game with easy movement rules, simple magic use, and a combat system that uses regular playing cards instead of dice.&quot;

In reviewing &quot;Fairy Meat: Sugar and Vice&quot;, Jennifer Brozek said &quot;Play this game with great abandon... and the next time your buddy says &#x27;Bite me!,&#x27; do it. Happy munching!&quot;.

A reviewer from RPGnet said &quot;Despite the wonderfully twisted premise of the game and its colorful components, the game is still quite similar to most miniature games. The gimmick of using cards, in fact, requires players to learn a new set of rules for old combat concepts. At best, the cannibalism and initiative rules are different, but not enough, in my opinion, to recommend this game.&quot;

Heather Wilson for the &quot;Voice of Youth Advocates&quot; said that &quot;Appropriate for an older teen audience, &quot;Fairy Meat&quot; is another game in which planning and decision-making is key. Its humor also encourages reading for pleasure. Different from most miniature games in presentation and play, the game appeals to those who don&#x27;t normally play miniatures. I enjoy the way that fairies are presented as vicious, vapid creatures who prefer fighting to flitting.&quot;

<doc id="986808" wikidata="Q2701927" url="?curid=986808" title="Koʻolau Range">
<text>Koolau Rangeis a name given to the dormant fragmented remnant of the eastern or windward shield volcano of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1972.

==Geology==
It is not a mountain range in the normal sense, because it was formed as a single mountain called Koolau Volcano (&quot;koolau&quot; means &quot;windward&quot; in Hawaiian, cognate of the toponym &quot;Tokelau&quot;). What remains of Koolau is the western half of the original volcano that was destroyed in prehistoric times when the entire eastern half—including much of the summit caldera—slid cataclysmically into the Pacific Ocean. Remains of this ancient volcano lie as massive fragments strewn nearly over the ocean floor to the northeast of Oahu. Kāneʻohe Bay is what remains of the ancient volcano&#x27;s summit caldera after the slide. The modern Koolau mountain forms Oahu&#x27;s windward coast and rises behind the leeward coast city of Honolulu — on its leeward slopes and valleys are located most of Honolulu&#x27;s residential neighborhoods.
The volcano is thought to have first erupted on the ocean floor more than 2.5 million years ago. It eventually reached sea level and continued to grow in elevation until about 1.7 million years ago, when the volcano became dormant. The volcano remained dormant for hundreds of thousands of years, during which time erosion ate away at the initially smooth slopes of the shield-shaped mountain; and the entire mass subsided considerably. The highest elevation perhaps exceeded ; today, the summit of the tallest peak, Puu Kōnāhuanui is only .

===Honolulu Volcanics===

After hundreds of thousands of years of dormancy, Koolau volcano began to erupt again. Some thirty eruptions over the past 500,000 years or so have created many of the landmarks around eastern Oahu, such as Diamond Head, Koko Head (Hanauma Bay), Koko Crater, Punchbowl Crater, Tantalus, and Āliapaakai, and are collectively known as the Honolulu Volcanic Series, or simply Honolulu Volcanics. According to the US Geological Survey, the most recent eruptions in this series of activity occurred between about 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. There is a possibility that Koolau volcano could erupt again; however, the chance of such an eruption occurring in &quot;our lifetimes, or even those of many future generations&quot; is remote.

==History==
The Ko‘olau Range is the erosion of remnants of a massive shield volcano, but estimates show evidence that it erupted approximately 2.5 million years ago.

Though during the ancient period, the Ko‘olau Range became a sacred area for the Native Hawaiians. In 1795, the newly-formed Hawaiian Kingdom conducted a battle resulting in the triumphant conquest of O&#x27;ahu on the range within part of the Nu‘uanu Pali Lookout, under the command of Kamehameha the Great, as his troops forced all of the warriors up the valley to fall to their deaths below the cliffs.

The Ko‘olau Range was designated in 1972 as a National Natural Landmark.

==Transportation==
There are three roads that tunnel through the southern part of the Koolau Range, connecting Honolulu to the Windward Coast. From leeward to windward:
* Hawaii Route 61 (Pali Highway)
* Hawaii Route 63 (Likelike Highway)
* Interstate H-3

<doc id="986814" wikidata="Q320" url="?curid=986814" title="Michelle Bachelet">
<text>Verónica Michelle Bachelet Jeria (; born 29 September 1951) is a Chilean politician who served as President of Chile from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018, becoming the first woman to hold the presidency. She was re-elected in December 2013 with over 62% of the vote, having previously received 54% in 2006, making her the first President of Chile to be re-elected since 1932. After her second term, she served as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2018 to 2022. Earlier in her career, she was appointed as the first executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

Bachelet, a physician with studies in military strategy, also held positions as Health Minister and Defense Minister under President Ricardo Lagos. She is a separated mother of three and identifies as agnostic. In addition to her native Spanish, she is fluent in English and has proficiency in German, French, and Portuguese.

==Family background==
Bachelet is the second child of archaeologist Ángela Jeria Gómez (1926–2020) and Air Force Brigadier General Alberto Bachelet Martínez (1923–1974).

Bachelet&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Louis-Joseph Bachelet Lapierre (1820–1864), was a French wine merchant from Chassagne-Montrachet who immigrated to Chile with his Parisian wife, Françoise Jeanne Beault, in 1860. He was hired as a wine-making expert by the Subercaseaux vineyards in Santiago. Bachelet Lapierre&#x27;s son, Germán, was born in Santiago in 1862 and, in 1891, married Luisa Brandt Cadot, a Chilean of French and Swiss descent. They had a son, Alberto Bachelet Brandt, born in 1894.

Bachelet&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Máximo Jeria Chacón, of Spanish (Basque) and Greek heritage, was the first person in Chile to earn a degree in agronomic engineering. He founded several agronomy schools in the country and married Lely Johnson, the daughter of an English physician working in Chile. Their son, Máximo Jeria Johnson, married Ángela Gómez Zamora, and they had five children, with Bachelet&#x27;s mother being the fourth.

==Early life and career==
===Childhood years ===
Bachelet was born in La Cisterna, a middle-class suburb of Santiago. She was named after French actress Michèle Morgan. Bachelet spent many of her childhood years traveling around her native Chile, moving with her family from one military base to another. She lived and attended primary schools in, among other places, Quintero, Antofagasta, and San Bernardo. In 1962, she moved with her family to the United States, where her father was assigned to the military mission at the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C. Her family lived for almost two years in Bethesda, Maryland, where she attended Western Junior High School and learned to speak English fluently.

Returning to Chile in 1964, she graduated in 1969 from Liceo Nº 1 Javiera Carrera, a prestigious girls&#x27; public high school, finishing near the top of her class. There she was class president, a member of the choir and volleyball teams, and part of a theater group and a band, &quot;Las Clap Clap,&quot; which she co-founded and which toured around several school festivals. In 1970, after obtaining a relatively high score on the university admission test, she entered medical school at the University of Chile, where she was selected in the 113th position (out of 160 admitted applicants). She originally intended to study sociology or economics, but was prevailed upon by her father to study medicine instead. She has said she opted for medicine because it was &#x27;a concrete way of helping people cope with pain&#x27; and &#x27;a way to contribute to improve health in Chile.&#x27;

===Detention and exile===
Facing growing food shortages, the government of Salvador Allende placed Bachelet&#x27;s father in charge of the Food Distribution Office. When General Augusto Pinochet suddenly came to power via the 11 September 1973 coup d&#x27;état, Bachelet&#x27;s father was detained at the Air War Academy on charges of treason. Following months of daily torture at Santiago&#x27;s Public Prison, he suffered a cardiac arrest that resulted in his death on 12 March 1974. In early January 1975, Bachelet and her mother were detained at their apartment by two DINA agents, who blindfolded them and drove them to Villa Grimaldi, a notorious secret detention center in Santiago, where they were separated and subjected to interrogation and torture.

In 2013, Bachelet said she had been interrogated by DINA chief Manuel Contreras there. Some days later, Bachelet was transferred to Cuatro Álamos (&quot;Four Poplars&quot;) detention center, where she was held until the end of January. Thanks to the assistance of Roberto Kozak, Bachelet was able to go into exile in Australia, where her older brother, Alberto, had moved in 1969.

Of her torture, Bachelet said, in 2004, that &quot;it was nothing in comparison to what others suffered&quot;. She was &quot;yelled at using abusive language, shaken&quot;, and both she and her mother were &quot;threatened with the killing of the other&quot;. She was &quot;never tortured with electricity&quot;, but she did see it done to other prisoners.

In May 1975, Bachelet left Australia and later relocated to East Germany, where she was assigned an apartment in Am Stern, Potsdam by the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Her mother joined her a month later and lived separately in Leipzig. In October 1976, Bachelet began working at a communal clinic in the Babelsberg neighborhood as a stepping stone to furthering her medical studies at a university in East Germany. During this time, she met architect Jorge Leopoldo Dávalos Cartes, another Chilean exile, and they married in 1977. In January 1978, Bachelet went to Leipzig to study German at the Herder Institute of Karl Marx University (now the University of Leipzig). She gave birth to her first child with Dávalos, Jorge Alberto Sebastián, in June 1978. She returned to Potsdam in September 1978 to continue her medical studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin for two years. Five months after enrolling as a student, however, she obtained authorization to return to her country.

===Return to Chile===
After four years in exile, Bachelet returned to Chile in 1979. Her medical school credits from the GDR were not recognized, so she had to restart her studies where she left off before she fled the country. Despite this setback, she graduated as physician-surgeon on 7 January 1983. Bachelet wanted to work in the public sector where she could make the most impact, but her request to work as a general practitioner was denied by the military government on &quot;political grounds&quot;.

However, Bachelet&#x27;s academic achievements and published papers earned her a scholarship from the Chilean Medical Chamber to specialize in pediatrics and public health at the Roberto del Río Children&#x27;s Hospital at the University of Chile&#x27; (1983–86). She completed the program with excellent grades but did not receive her certification for &quot;financial reasons&quot;.

During this time, Bachelet also worked at PIDEE (Protection of Children Injured by States of Emergency Foundation), a non-governmental organization that provided support for the children of the missing and the tortured in Santiago and Chillán. She served as the head of the Medical Department of the foundation from 1986 and 1990. Some time after the birth of her second child with Dávalos, Francisca Valentina, in February 1984, she and her husband legally separated. Between 1985 and 1987, Bachelet had a romantic relationship with Alex Vojkovic Trier, an engineer and spokesman for the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front, an armed group that, among other actions, attempted to assassinate Pinochet in 1986. The affair was a minor issue during her presidential campaign, during which she stated that she never supported any of Vojkovic&#x27;s activities.

After Chile&#x27;s transition to democracy in 1990, Bachelet worked for the Ministry of Health&#x27;s West Santiago Health Service and served as a consultant for the Pan-American Health Organization, the World Health Organization, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit. While working for the National AIDS Commission (Conasida), she became romantically involved with Aníbal Hernán Henríquez Marich, a fellow physician and a right-wing supporter of Pinochet, who fathered her third child, Sofía Catalina, in December 1992. Their relationship ended a few years later. From March 1994 and July 1997, Bachelet worked as Senior Assistant to the Deputy Health Minister. Driven by an interest in civil-military relations, Bachelet began studying military strategy at the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies (ANEPE) in Chile in 1996, earning first place in her class. This achievement earned her a presidential scholarship, allowing her to continue her studies in the United States at the Inter-American Defense College in Washington, D.C., where she completed a Continental Defense Course in 1998. That same year she returned to Chile to work for the Defense Ministry as the Senior Assistant to the Defense Minister and went on to graduate from a Master&#x27;s program in military science at the Chilean Army&#x27;s War Academy.

==Early political career==

===Involvement in politics===
In 1970, during her first year as a university student, Bachelet joined the Socialist Youth and was an active supporter of the Popular Unity. In the immediate aftermath of the coup, she and her mother worked as couriers for the underground Socialist Party directorate, which was trying to organize a resistance movement. Eventually, almost all of them were captured and disappeared.

In the second half of the 1980s, Bachelet, after her return from exile, became politically active, fighting for the restoration of democracy in Chile, although not on the front line. In 1995, she became a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee and, from 1998 to 2000, she was an active member of the Political Commission. In 1996, she ran against future presidential opponent Joaquín Lavín for the mayorship of Las Condes, a wealthy suburb of Santiago and a right-wing stronghold. Lavín won the 22-candidate election with nearly 78% of the vote, while Bachelet finished fourth with 2.35%.

===Minister of Health===

On 11 March 2000, virtually unknown at the time, Bachelet was appointed Minister of Health by President Ricardo Lagos. She conducted an in-depth study of the public healthcare system which resulted in the creation of the AUGE plan a few years later. During her tenure, she was given the challenging task of eliminating the waiting lists in the overburdened public hospital system within the first 100 days of Lagos&#x27;s government. Although she was successful in reducing the waiting lists by 90%, she was unable to completely eliminate them and offered her resignation, which was promptly rejected by the President. Bachelet authorized the free distribution of the morning-after pill for victims of sexual abuse, which sparked controversy.

===Minister of National Defense===
On 7 January 2002 Bachelet was appointed Minister of National Defense, becoming the first woman in a Latin American country and one of the few in the world to hold this position. As Minister of Defense, she fostered reconciliatory gestures between the military and victims of the dictatorship, leading to General Juan Emilio Cheyre, head of the army, making a historic declaration in 2003 that the military would &quot;never again&quot; subvert democracy in Chile. Additionally, she oversaw reforms of the military pension system and continued with the modernization process of the Chilean armed forces, including purchasing of new military equipment and participating in international peace operations. One key moment that has been cited as a factor in Bachelet&#x27;s chances to the presidency occurred in mid-2002, during a flood in northern Santiago. As Defense Minister, she led a rescue operation while wearing a cloak and military cap, perched atop an amphibious tank.

===2005–2006 presidential election===
By the end of 2004, Bachelet&#x27;s surging popularity in opinion polls made her the only politician within the Coalition of Parties for Democracy (Concertación de los Partidos por la Democracia; CPD) who was capable of defeating Joaquín Lavín in the presidential election. As a result, she was chosen as the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate for the presidency. Initially hesitant to accept the nomination, as it was never a goal of hers, she eventually agreed as she felt she could not let her supporters down. On 1 October of that year, she stepped down from her government position to fully focus on her campaign and to support the CPD in the municipal elections held later that month. On 28 January 2005 she was officially named the Socialist Party&#x27;s presidential candidate. An open primary was scheduled for July 2005 to determine the CPD&#x27;s sole presidential candidate, but it was canceled after Bachelet&#x27;s only rival, Christian Democrat Soledad Alvear, a cabinet member in the first three CPD administrations, withdrew early due to a lack of support within her own party and in opinion polls.

In the December 2005 election, Bachelet ran against three candidates: Sebastián Piñera from the center-right (RN), Joaquín Lavín from the right-wing (UDI), and Tomás Hirsch from the left (JPM). As predicted by opinion polls, she didn&#x27;t receive the absolute majority needed to win the election outright, obtaining 46% of the vote. On 15 January 2006, she went on to face Piñera in the runoff election and won the presidency with 53.5% of the vote, becoming Chile&#x27;s first female president and the first woman in Latin America to reach the presidency through a direct election without being the wife of a previous head of state or political leader.

On 30 January 2006, Bachelet was declared President-elect by the Elections Certification Court (Tricel) and announced her cabinet, which, for the first time, was composed of an equal number of men and women, as promised during her campaign. To reflect the balance of power within the Coalition, Bachelet named seven ministers from the Christian Democrat Party (PDC), five from the Party for Democracy (PPD), four from the Socialist Party (PS), one from the Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD), and three without party affiliation.

==First presidency (2006–2010)==

===First days===
Bachelet was sworn in as President of the Republic of Chile on 11 March 2006 in a ceremony held in a plenary session of the National Congress in Valparaíso attended by many foreign heads of states and delegates. Much of Bachelet&#x27;s first three months as president were spent working on 36 measures she had promised during her campaign to implement during her first 100 days in office. They ranged from simple presidential decrees, such as providing free health care for older patients, to complex bills to reform the social security system and the electoral system. For her first state visit, Bachelet chose Argentina, arriving in Buenos Aires on 21 March. There she met with president Néstor Kirchner, with whom she signed strategic agreements on energy and infrastructure, including the possibility of launching a bidding process to operate the Transandine Railway.

===Domestic affairs===
====Social policies====
In March 2006 Bachelet created an advisory committee to reform the pension system, which was headed by former budget director Mario Marcel. The commission issued its final report in July 2006, and in March 2008 Bachelet signed the bill into law. The new legislation established a Basic Solidarity Pension (PBS) and a Solidarity Pension Contribution (APS), guaranteeing a minimum pension for the 60% poorest segment of the population, regardless of their contribution history. The reform also grants a bonus to female pensioners for every child born alive.

In October 2006 Bachelet enacted legislation to protect subcontracted employees, which would benefit an estimated 1.2 million workers. In June 2009 she introduced pay equality legislation, guaranteeing equal pay for equal work in the private sector, regardless of gender.

In September 2009 Bachelet signed the &quot;Chile Grows with You&quot; plan into law, providing comprehensive social services to vulnerable children from ages zero to six. That law also established a social welfare management framework called the &quot;Intersectoral Social Protection System&quot;, made up of subsystems such as &quot;Chile Solidario&quot; and &quot;Chile Grows with You&quot;.

Between 2008 and 2010 the Bachelet administration delivered a so-called &quot;literary briefcase&quot; (a box of books including encyclopedias, dictionaries, poetry works and books for both children and adults) to the 400,000 poorest families with children attending primary school from first to fourth grade.

In March 2009, Bachelet launched the &quot;I Choose my PC&quot; program, awarding free computers to poor seventh-graders with excellent academic performance attending government-subsidized schools. During 2009 and 2010 Bachelet delivered maternity packages to all babies born in public hospitals, which are about 80% of total births. In January 2010, Bachelet promulgated a law allowing the distribution of emergency contraception pills in public and private health centers, including to persons under 14, without parental consent. The law also requires high schools to add a sexual education program to their curriculum.

====Student protests====
Bachelet&#x27;s first political crisis came in late April 2006, when massive high school student demonstrations – unseen in three decades – broke out throughout the country, demanding better public education. In June 2006, she sought to dampen the student protests by setting up an 81-member advisory committee, including education experts from all political backgrounds, representatives of ethnic groups, parents, teachers, students, school owners, university rectors, people from diverse religious denominations, etc. Its purpose was to propose changes to the country&#x27;s educational system and serve as a forum to share ideas and views. The committee issued its final report in December 2006. In August 2009, she signed the education reform bill into law, which created two new regulatory bodies: a Superintendency on Education and a Quality Agency.

====Transantiago fiasco====
During her presidency Bachelet opened 18 new subway stations in Santiago, nine in 2006, one in 2009 and eight in 2010. In December 2009 Bachelet announced the construction of a new subway line in Santiago, to be operational by 2014 (the date was later changed to mid-2016).

In February 2007 Santiago&#x27;s transport system was radically altered with the introduction of Transantiago, designed under the previous administration. The system was nearly unanimously condemned by the media, the users and the opposition, significantly damaging her popularity, and leading to the sacking of her Transport minister. On her decision not to abort the plan&#x27;s start, she said in April 2007 she was given erroneous information which caused her to act against her &quot;instincts.&quot;

In September 2008, Chile&#x27;s Constitutional Court declared a US$400 million loan by the Inter-American Development Bank to fund the transport system unconstitutional. Bachelet – who had been forced to ask for the loan after Congress had refused to approve funds for the beleaguered program in November 2007 – made use of an emergency clause in the Constitution that grants funds equivalent to 2% of the fiscal budget. In November 2008, she invoked the emergency clause again after Congress denied once again funds for the system for 2009.

====2010 earthquake====
On 27 February 2010, during the last week of summer vacations and less than two weeks before Bachelet&#x27;s term was set to expire, Chile was struck by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that killed over 500 people and caused widespread damage, including the collapse of apartment buildings and bridges and tsunamis that destroyed fishing villages. Bachelet and the government faced criticism for their slow response to the disaster, which hit on a Saturday at 3:34 am and left most of the country without electricity, phone, and Internet access. Bachelet declared a state of catastrophe and, on Sunday afternoon, sent military troops to the most affected areas in an effort to quell instances of looting and arson. She also imposed night curfews in the most affected cities, but was criticized for not deploying the troops quickly enough.

====Human rights====

In January 2010 Bachelet opened the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, documenting the horrors of Pinochet&#x27;s -year dictatorship. In November she promulgated a law (submitted to Congress during the previous administration) creating the National Institute for Human Rights, with the goal of protecting and promoting human rights in the country. The law also allowed for the reopening of the Rettig and Valech commissions for 18 months. She used her power as president to send a bill to legalize gay marriages, and sponsored a reproductive rights bill.

On 10 August 2018 the outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein warmly welcomed the UN General Assembly&#x27;s appointment of Michelle Bachelet to succeed him. He said that &quot;She has all the attributes – courage, perseverance, passion, and a deep commitment to human rights&quot;.

====Other legislation passed====
In August 2008, Bachelet signed a freedom of information bill into law, which became effective in April 2009.

In January 2010, Bachelet enacted a law creating the Ministry for the Environment. The new legislation also created the Environmental Evaluation Service and the Superintendency for the Environment.

Half of the ministries in her first government were occupied by women; in her successor&#x27;s team, Sebastián Piñera, 18% were.

====Economy====
Bachelet was widely credited for resisting calls from politicians within her own coalition to spend the country&#x27;s huge copper revenues to close the income gap. Instead in 2007 she created the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund, a sovereign wealth fund which accumulates fiscal surpluses above 1% of GDP. This allowed her to finance new social policies and provide economic stimulus packages when the 2008 financial crisis hit the country.

During her four years in office, the economy grew at an average rate of 3.3% per year (2.3% on per capita basis), reaching a high of 5.7% in 2006 and a low of −1.0% in 2009 due to the global financial crisis. The real minimum wage increased an average of 2% per year, the lowest increase of any president since 1990, while unemployment hovered between 7 and 8% for the first three years, then rose to nearly 11% during 2009. Inflation averaged 4.5% per year, reaching close to 9% in 2008 due to rising food prices. Absolute poverty fell from 13.7% in November 2006 to 11.5% in November 2009.

====Political issues====
Bachelet began her term with an unprecedented absolute majority in both chambers of Congress. Prior to the elimination of appointed senators in the 2005 constitutional reforms, the CPD had never held a majority in the Senate. However, she was soon met with internal opposition from several discontented lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, known as &quot;díscolos&quot; (&quot;disobedient&quot;, &quot;ungovernable&quot;). This opposition jeopardized the coalition&#x27;s fragile and historic congressional majority on a number of key executive-sponsored bills during much of her first two years in office and forced Bachelet to negotiate with a right-wing opposition that she perceived as &quot;obstructionist&quot;. By 2007, the CPD had lost its absolute majority in both chambers of Congress as several senators and deputies from the coalition became independent.

In December 2006, Pinochet died. Bachelet decided not to grant him a state funeral, an honour bestowed upon constitutionally elected Chilean presidents, but a military funeral as former commander-in-chief of the Army appointed by President Salvador Allende. She also refused to declare an official national day of mourning, but did authorize flags at military barracks to fly at half staff. Pinochet&#x27;s coffin was also allowed to be draped in a Chilean flag. Bachelet did not attend his funeral, saying it would be &quot;a violation of [her] conscience&quot;, and sent Defense Minister Vivianne Blanlot instead.

In April 2008, Bachelet&#x27;s Education Minister, Yasna Provoste, was impeached by Congress for her handling of a scandal involving mismanagement of school subsidies. Her conviction was the first for a sitting minister in 36 years.

===Foreign relations===
====Argentina====
During her first year in office Bachelet faced continuing problems from neighbors Argentina and Peru. In July 2006, she sent a letter of protest to Argentine president Néstor Kirchner after his government issued a decree increasing export tariffs on natural gas to Chile, which was considered by Bachelet to be a violation of a tacit bilateral agreement.

====Peru====
In early 2007, Peru accused Chile of unilaterally redefining their shared sea boundary in a section of a law passed by Congress that detailed the borders of the new administrative region of Arica and Parinacota. The impasse was resolved by the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal, which declared that section unconstitutional. In March 2007, the Chilean state-owned and independent public broadcaster Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN) canceled the broadcast of a documentary about the War of the Pacific after a cautionary call was made to the stations&#x27; board of directors by Chilean Foreign Relations Minister Alejandro Foxley, apparently acting on demands made by the Peruvian ambassador to Chile; the show was finally broadcast in late May of that year. In August 2007 the Chilean government filed a formal diplomatic protest with Peru and summoned home its ambassador after Peru published an official map claiming a part of the Pacific Ocean that Chile considers its sovereign territory. Peru said this was just another step in its plans to bring the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In January 2008 Peru asked the court to consider the dispute, prompting Bachelet to summon home the Chilean ambassador in Lima for consultations.

====UN voting deadlock====
The United Nations Security Council election held on 16 October 2006, which saw a deadlock between Venezuela and Guatemala for the two-year, non-permanent Latin American and Caribbean seat on the Security Council, developed into a significant ideological issue in Chile and was viewed as a test for Bachelet. The governing coalition was split, with the Socialists supporting Venezuela&#x27;s bid and the Christian Democrats strongly opposing it. The day before the vote, the president announced through her spokesman that Chile would abstain, citing the lack of regional consensus on a single candidate, ending months of speculation. In March 2007, Chile&#x27;s ambassador to Venezuela, Claudio Huepe, said in an interview with teleSUR that Bachelet personally told him that she had initially intended to vote for Venezuela but then &quot;there were a series of circumstances that forced me to abstain&quot;. The government quickly recalled Huepe and accepted his resignation.
====Unasur====
In May 2008, Bachelet became the first President pro tempore of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) and in September she called for an urgent summit after Bolivian President Evo Morales warned of a possible coup attempt against him. The presidents of Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Colombia, and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, met with Bachelet at the La Moneda Palace in Santiago, where they agreed to send two commissions to Bolivia: one to mediate between the executive and the opposition, and another to investigate the killings in Pando Department.

====Cuba visit====
In February 2009, Bachelet visited Cuba and met with Fidel Castro. There she urged the United States to put an end to the embargo. No Chilean head of state had visited the country in 37 years. Despite petitions from the Christian Democratic Party of her own governing coalition, and of the opposition parties, Bachelet did not meet with Cuban dissidents during her visit. Soon after the meeting, Castro wrote that the &quot;fascist and vengeful Chilean oligarchy is the same which more than 100 years ago robbed Bolivia of its access to the Pacific and of copper-rich lands in a humiliating war&quot;.

====Progressive Leaders summit====
In March 2009, Bachelet hosted in Viña del Mar the &quot;Progressive Leaders Summit&quot;, meeting with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and presidents Tabaré Vázquez of Uruguay, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina. The meeting garnered some media interest because it took place six days before the highly anticipated G-20 Summit in London.

====Trade====
Continuing the coalition&#x27;s free-trade strategy, in August 2006 Bachelet promulgated a free trade agreement with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei, the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (P4), also signed under Lagos&#x27;s presidency. She held free-trade talks with other countries, including Australia, Vietnam, Turkey and Malaysia. Regionally, she signed bilateral free trade agreements with Panama, Peru and Colombia.

====Other policies====
In October 2007, Bachelet granted amnesty to undocumented migrants from other Latin American countries. The measure was expected to benefit around 15,000 Peruvians and 2,000 Bolivians. In December 2007 she signed in Bolivia a trilateral agreement with the presidents of Brazil and Bolivia to complete and improve a 4,700 km road to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, via Arica and Iquique in Chile and Santos in Brazil. In May 2008, following months of intense lobbying, Chile was elected as member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, obtaining the largest vote among Latin American countries.

In December 2009 Chile became the first country in South America, and the second in Latin America after Mexico, to receive an invitation to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Bachelet signed the accession agreement in January 2010, but it formally became a member in May 2010, after she had left office.

===Popularity===

Bachelet enjoyed an approval rating above 50% for her first three months in office, during the so-called &quot;honeymoon period&quot;. Her popularity fell during the student protests that year, hovering in the mid-40s. In July she had a disastrous public relations incident when a group of residents she was visiting in the southern city of Chiguayante who were affected by a landslide berated her publicly on television, accusing her of using their tragedy to boost her falling popularity. One woman demanded that she leave the scene so rescue efforts could continue. In July, after only four months in office, Bachelet was forced to reshuffle her cabinet, in what was the fastest ministerial adjustment since 1990.

Bachelet&#x27;s popularity dipped further in her second year, reaching a low of 35% approval, 46% disapproval in September 2007. This fall was mainly attributed to the Transantiago fiasco. That same month she had a second negative incident when a group of earthquake and tsunami victims she was visiting in the southern region of Aisén received her bearing black flags and accused her of showing up late. The city mayor, who told Bachelet to &quot;go to hell&quot;, later apologized. Over the following 12 months, however, Bachelet&#x27;s approval ratings did not improve.

At the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008 Bachelet&#x27;s popularity was at 42%, but gradually her job approval ratings began to rise. When she left office in March 2010 her popular support was at a record 84%, according to conservative polling institute Adimark GfK.

The Chilean Constitution does not allow a president to serve two consecutive terms and Bachelet endorsed Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle for the December 2009 election.

==Political interregnum==
In April 2010, Bachelet inaugurated her own think-tank, &quot;Fundación Dialoga&quot;. Its headquarters are located in Providencia, a suburb of Santiago.

Bachelet is a member of the Club of Madrid, the world&#x27;s largest forum of former heads of state and government. Since 2010 she has also been a member of the Inter-American Dialogue, the leading think tank on Western Hemisphere relations and affairs, and served as the organization&#x27;s co-chair.

On 14 September 2010, Bachelet was appointed head of the newly created United Nations body UN Women by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. She took office on 19 September 2010. On 15 March 2013 she announced her resignation.

===2013 presidential election===
On 27 March 2013, Bachelet announced that she would seek a second term as President of Chile in the 2013 elections. The well-respected CEP released a poll in May 2012 suggesting that 51% of voters wished to see her become the next president, far ahead of any other would-be candidate.

On 30 June 2013, Bachelet became the Nueva Mayoría&#x27;s candidate for president after she won a four-way primary election with the support of five center and left parties (PS, PPD, PC, IC, MAS) and 73% of the vote.

In the 17 November 2013 presidential election, Bachelet fell short of the absolute majority needed for an outright win. In the runoff election, held on 15 December of that year, she beat former senator and Minister of Labor Evelyn Matthei with over 62% of the vote; turnout was significantly lower than in the first round.

==Second presidency (2014–2018)==

Bachelet was sworn in as President of the Republic of Chile for her second term on 11 March 2014, at the National Congress in Valparaíso. Isabel Allende, the daughter of former President Salvador Allende and newly elected President of the Senate, administered the affirmation of office to Bachelet, marking the first time in the country&#x27;s history that both parties involved were women.

===Domestic policies===
====Education reform====
Among Bachelet&#x27;s main campaign promises for the 2013 election was the introduction of free university education in Chile and the end of profit-making educational institutions, as a response to the 2011–13 Chilean student protests. The intention was that revenue from the increase in corporate tax rate by 2017 would be used to fund free education. The proposals were criticized and quickly became unpopular due to the opposition from students who felt that the proposals did not go far enough in removing profit making. Opposition parties, lower middle class voters and certain members of Bachelet&#x27;s Nueva Mayoría coalition attacked the proposals as the law that would prevent individuals from earning profits on public resources would not address making improvements in quality of education.

In 2015, the Chile Constitutional Court rejected large portions of Bachelet&#x27;s plan to offer free college education to half of the nation&#x27;s poorest students on grounds that requiring them to attend certain schools participating in the program could be considered discrimination. However, what remained of the plan allowed Bachelet to send 200,000 students from low-income families to college free of cost.

In January 2018, the Chilean Senate passed a law guaranteeing free education which was supported by conservative opposition parties as well, allowing the poorest 60% of students to study for free and doubled state funding for public universities. The new legislation created a higher education Superintendent empowered to supervise and penalize institutions which do not provide quality of education or have for-profit operations.

====Tax reform====
In September 2014, the Chilean Congress passed Bachelet&#x27;s tax reform proposal which aimed to increase revenue by 3% of gross domestic product. Measures included in the reform were:
* increased corporate tax rate from 20% to 25% or 27%
* the maximum tax bracket for personal income tax lowered to 35 percent from 40 percent starting in 2018
* increased excise taxes for sweetened beverages, alcohol and tobacco
* &quot;Green&quot; taxes including a tax on carbon emissions for thermoelectric plants bigger than 50 MW and a tax on the import of diesel vehicles with higher cylinder capacity, excluding work vehicles
* measures against tax evasion

Critics blamed tax reforms for complexity driving away investment and for the slowdown of the Chilean economy during Bachelet&#x27;s second period in office. However, Bachelet&#x27;s supporters argue that falling copper prices were more to blame for the economic slowdown. They argue that economic forecasts of faster growth in conjunction with rising copper prices and exports from 2018 onwards (after Bachelet&#x27;s term) suggest that the tax reforms did not negatively affect the economy. Others, such as MIT-trained economist and academic Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, have found that Chile&#x27;s overall terms of trade under Bachelet&#x27;s second term worsened only marginally compared to those of her predecessor Sebastián Piñera, due in part to a lower cost of key imports like petroleum. Consequently, he concludes that Bachelet&#x27;s reforms and governance likely were instrumental in causing a period of dampened growth throughout her presidency.

====Environmental policy====
After Easter Island&#x27;s Rapa Nui inhabitants voted 73% in favor of establishing a conservation zone, Michelle Bachelet designated a new 720,000 square kilometer protection area in September 2017, protecting at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction. Five new national parks in the Patagonia region were created under a presidential decree, covering 10 million acres in January 2018, including 1 million acres of land contributed by conservationist Kris Tompkins. On 9 March 2018, Bachelet created nine marine reserves to protect biodiversity with her final presidential decree, increasing the area of the sea under state protection from 4.2 percent to 42.4 percent. The measure is expected to benefit marine life in approximately 1.4 million square kilometers.

====Civil unions and same-sex marriage====
When Michelle Bachelet again took office of President in March 2014, she made passing Piñera&#x27;s civil union bill a priority.
The name of the bill was changed to &quot;Civil Union Pact&quot; (&quot;Pacto de Unión Civil&quot;) on 17 December, and Congress reiterated their intention to hold the final vote by January 2015. On 6 January 2015, a provision recognizing foreign marriages as civil unions was approved in the Constitutional Committee while the child adoption clause was turned down. The bill went to a final vote before both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies as it was amended. On 13 January, the full Chamber of Deputies reinserted the adoption provision. On 20 January 2015, the Chamber approved the bill on a vote of 86 to 23 with 2 abstentions. On 27 January, the Senate rejected all the Chamber&#x27;s amendments, so the bill was headed to the joint committee of both houses. The committee reached the agreement in regard to the text of the bill and changed its name to &quot;Civil Union Agreement&quot; (&quot;Acuerdo de Unión Civil&quot;) the same day. The bill was passed in both houses on 28 January 2015. Several lawmakers asked the Chilean Constitutional Court to verify the bill&#x27;s constitutionality, which was upheld by the court in a ruling released on 6 April 2015. The bill was signed into law by President Bachelet on 13 April 2015. It was published in the Official Gazette on 21 April 2015 and took effect on 22 October 2015.

Chile&#x27;s civil union provisions enable couples to claim pension benefits and inherit property if their civil partner dies as well as more easily co-own property and make medical decisions for one another. The Government estimated at the time of the law going into effect that some two million Chilean couples cohabiting could have their unions legally recognized. In the day following the law going into effect, approximately 1,600 couples signed up to register their unions.

On 1 December 2016, the Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved (except for 6 abstentions) a bill to give couples who enter in a civil union five days off, like what married couples have. The bill was approved by the Senate in October 2017, in a unanimous 15–0 vote.

====Women&#x27;s rights and abortion====
A new Ministry for Women and Gender Inequality was formed, replacing the National Women&#x27;s Service in June 2016 which aimed to formulate policies against abuse of women and gender inequality. Claudia Pascual was appointed as the first ever Minister for Women and Gender Inequality.

The Chilean Congress approved Bachelet&#x27;s abortion legalization bill in some circumstances in July 2017, but was subjected to challenge in the Constitutional Court.
Later, Chile&#x27;s total abortion ban implemented under the Pinochet regime in 1989 was lifted in August 2017 after the Constitutional Court voted 6–4 to allow the procedure under some circumstances: in cases of pregnancy as a result of rape (up to 12 weeks), if the fetus endangers the mother&#x27;s life, or if the fetus is not viable. Prior to this, Chile was one of only four nations in the Americas that had a total ban on abortions, the others being El Salvador, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.

====Constitutional and political reform====
The Chilean Congress passed Bachelet&#x27;s proposed abolishment of the binomial voting system introduced by the Augusto Pinochet regime and restoring proportional representation for election to both chambers of the Chilean Congress and requirements that 40% of candidates nominated are female in January 2015. The new system took effect from the 2017 elections, increasing the members of the Chamber of Deputies from 120 to 155 seats and the Senate from 38 seats to 43 seats in 2017 and 50 seats in 2021. As a result, the 2017 election saw the end of the dominance of Bachelet&#x27;s Nueva Mayoría and conservative coalitions and increased number of new political parties represented in Congress.

Following revelations that President Bachelet&#x27;s son and daughter in-law were caught in an influence-peddling scandal, she appointed a Presidential Advisory Council on Conflicts of Interest, Influence Peddling, and Corruption (known as the &quot;Engel Commission&quot;) headed by economist Eduardo Engel. Subsequently, reforms recommended by the commission were implemented which included, ability to remove politicians from office if found guilty for transparency and election spending limits violations with disqualification for two subsequent elections and constitutional autonomy to Chile&#x27;s electoral service (SERVEL), giving it complete independence from the government to more effectively oversee electoral processes and the functioning of politics in general.

In 2016, overseas voting rights for Chilean women and men living outside the country were introduced, allowing Chilean citizens who live abroad to exercise their right to vote beginning from the 2017 elections.

===Foreign policy===
====Trade====

On 8 March 2018, three days before Bachelet left office, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) multilateral trade agreement was signed in Santiago with Chile and 10 other signatory countries in the Asia Pacific region, following renegotiation of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which was signed in February 2016. The TPP was renegotiated into the CPTPP following the United States&#x27; withdrawal from the original TPP in January 2017.

===Popularity===
In September 2015, Bachelet&#x27;s approval rating was 24%, compared to 72% disapproval. Chileans&#x27; support for her dropped sharply after revelations of corruption scandals such as the Caval scandal, which involved her son and daughter-in-law accepting millions of dollars in the form of a loan from vice-chairman of the Banco de Chile Andrónico Luksic Craig. The couple&#x27;s company (Caval) used the money to purchase land and resell it at a $5 million profit after repaying the loan. Bachelet maintains that she was unaware of her family&#x27;s actions and found out about the agreement between Luksic and her daughter-in-law through the press. By August 2016, Bachelet&#x27;s approval rating dropped to 15%, the lowest for any President since the return of free elections in 1990, and in March 2017, Bachelet&#x27;s approval rating remained low, at about 23%.

Bachelet left office in March 2018 with an approval rating at 39% according to Adimark, in contrast to the 84% rating when she left office in 2010.

==UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (2018–2022)==

On 10 September 2018, Bachelet urged China to allow observers into Xinjiang and expressed concern about the situation there. She said that: &quot;The UN rights group had shown that Uyghurs and other Muslims are being detained in camps across Xinjiang and I expect discussions with Chinese officials to begin soon&quot;. China called for Bachelet to respect its sovereignty.

In September 2018, Bachelet criticized the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. She has called on Saudi Arabia to hold accountable those responsible for airstrikes on civilians in Yemen.

On 5 October 2019, Bachelet said she was &quot;troubled by the high levels of violence associated with some demonstrations&quot; during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, and stressed that any measures to quell the unrest must be grounded in law. She also stated that &quot;Freedom of peaceful assembly … should be enjoyed without restriction to the greatest extent possible. But on the other hand, we cannot accept people who use masks to provoke violence.&quot;

Regarding the November 2019 Iranian protests, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a jailed Iranian lawyer, asked Bachelet to administrate an independent investigation into the alleged atrocities committed by the Iranian security forces in the uprising.

In January 2020, Bachelet has issued a report on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in the occupied Syrian Golan. This report said that &quot;the establishment and expansion of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory amounts to the transfer by Israel of its population into the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law. The transfer of an occupying Power&#x27;s population to a territory it occupies amounts to a war crime that may engage the individual criminal responsibility of those involved. A number of international bodies have confirmed the illegality of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan, including the International Court of Justice, the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bachelet asked the United States to suspend its sanctions regimes as way to help alleviate the pandemic&#x27;s impact on the people of sanctioned countries.

On 9 October 2020, Bachelet expressed concern about the suffering of civilians during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

In January 2021, in preparation for the 2021 spring session of the UN Human Rights Council, Bachelet has issued a report on Sri Lanka. The report criticizes the failure of the current Sri Lankan government to address documented accusations of grave and numerous human rights crimes perpetrated during and after the Civil war in Sri Lanka, even though the war ended in 2009.

In February 2022, Bachelet report on Human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory said that &quot;there are serious concerns that steps taken thus far by Israel and the Palestinian authorities to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian law during the escalation of hostilities in May 2021 have not been sufficient&quot; and &quot;there was an almost total failure to ensure accountability for numerous allegations of the excessive use of force by Israeli forces in the context of law enforcement operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, resulting in the killing and injury of Palestinians. With regard to the Palestinian authorities, few steps were documented in the investigation and prosecution of members of Palestinian security forces or of the security forces in Gaza responsible for the alleged excessive use of force and other human rights violations committed against Palestinians.&quot;

Bachelet&#x27;s visited Xinjiang in May 2022 which marked the first time in 17 years that a UN high commissioner for human rights had travelled to China. Bachelet&#x27;s statement following the visit praised China&#x27;s &quot;[p]overty alleviation and the eradication of extreme poverty, 10 years ahead of its target date&quot; as &quot;tremendous achievements&quot;, noting also that China&#x27;s &quot;introduction of universal health care and almost universal unemployment insurance scheme go a long way in ensuring protection of the right to health and broader social and economic rights&quot;. Bachelet stated that in Xinjiang she &quot;raised questions and concerns about the application of counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation measures and their broad application – particularly their impact on the rights of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities&quot; and that &quot;the Government assured me that the [Vocational and Educational Training Center] system has been dismantled&quot;. She also &quot;encouraged the Government to undertake a review of all counter terrorism and deradicalization policies to ensure they fully comply with international human rights standards, and in particular that they are not applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory way&quot;.

Bachelet&#x27;s visit was criticized by organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Campaign for Uyghurs, and the World Uyghur Congress. The New York Times described Bachelet&#x27;s comments regarding Xinjiang as &quot;couched in the language of the Chinese government&quot; and the editorial boards of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the visit.

On 13 June 2022, Bachelet announced that she would not seek a second term as UN High Commissioner on Human Rights following the expiration of her term on 31 August 2022. She said the decision was motivated by her desire to spend more time with her family in Chile and was unrelated to her recently concluded trip to Xinjiang. According to Al Jazeera, the United Nation&#x27;s Human Rights Office is politically charged and nearly all its high commissioners have avoided seeking term extensions. In her final brief at the UN&#x27;s summer session, Bachelet touched on a number of issues, including the work her office was doing to provide an updated assessment on the human rights situation in Xinjiang and supporting calls for investigation into Israel&#x27;s alleged killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, stating that the &quot;now chronically high levels of killings and injuries of Palestinians, including children by Israeli forces in the occupied Palestinian territory, have continued in the first six months of 2022&quot;. Bachelet&#x27;s report on Xinjiang was published on her final day in the role of high commissioner, but unusually she did not sign off on the report with her signature.

<text>John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee (born 3 October 1956), styled Viscount Prestwood between 1967 and 1991, is a British Conservative Party peer and member of the House of Lords. He is the grandson of Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, who was the first Earl Attlee.

==Early life==
Attlee was educated at Stowe School, trained with Smiths Industries, and worked mainly in materials management.

==Professional career==
In 1985, Attlee went into business in the field of commercial vehicle recovery and repair. In this connection he is president of the Heavy Transport Association and Patron of the Road Rescue Recovery Association.

He undertook a tour with the non-governmental organisation British Direct Aid in Bosnia during the winter of 1993–94, and then ran British Direct Aid&#x27;s operation in Rwanda for most of 1995.

==Military service==
A member of the Territorial Army, Attlee served in Bosnia with an aid agency during 1993–1994. He has also served in the Gulf War.

==Political career==
Attlee inherited his title following his father&#x27;s death in 1991 and entered the House of Lords in 1992, initially as a crossbencher. Shortly before the general election of 1997 he joined the Conservative Party. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.

He served as an Opposition spokesman on various subjects; immediately prior to the 2010 general election he was spokesman for transport and an Opposition whip. Following the Conservative victory in that election Earl Attlee was appointed a Lord-in-waiting or Government whip in the House of Lords. He continued in that role until April 2014, when he left the government. He was replaced by Susan Williams, Baroness Williams of Trafford.

==Personal life==
Earl Attlee married Teresa Ahern on 27 September 2008, in the Crypt Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, Palace of Westminster. Lady Attlee is the younger daughter of Mortimer Ahern, of Malvern, Worcestershire. Should Lord Attlee die without a son, the earldom will become extinct.

<doc id="986836" wikidata="Q1516218" url="?curid=986836" title="Giant Steps">
<text>Giant Steps is a studio album by the jazz musician John Coltrane. It was released in February 1960 through Atlantic Records. This was Coltrane&#x27;s first album as leader for the label, with which he had signed a new contract the previous year. The record is regarded as one of the most influential jazz albums of all time. Many of its tracks have become practice templates for jazz saxophonists. In 2004, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. It attained gold record status in 2018, having sold 500,000 copies.

Two tracks, &quot;Naima&quot; and &quot;Syeeda&#x27;s Song Flute&quot;, are respectively named after Coltrane&#x27;s wife at the time and her daughter, whom he adopted. A third, &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot;, takes its name from the initials of bassist Paul Chambers, who played on the album. A fourth, &quot;Cousin Mary&quot;, is named in honor of Mary Lyerly, Coltrane&#x27;s younger cousin.

==Background==
In 1959, Miles Davis&#x27;s business manager Harold Lovett negotiated a record contract for Coltrane with Atlantic, the terms of which included a $7,000 annual guarantee (). Initial sessions for this album, the second recording date for Coltrane under his new contract after a January 15 date led by Milt Jackson, took place on March 26, 1959. Coltrane was dissatisfied with the results of this session with Cedar Walton and Lex Humphries, and hence they were not used for the album, but appeared on subsequent compilations and reissues. Principal recording for the album took place on May 4 and 5, two weeks after Coltrane had participated in the final session for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. The track &quot;Naima&quot; was recorded on December 2 with Coltrane&#x27;s bandmates, the rhythm section from the Miles Davis Quintet, who would provide the backing for most of his next album, &quot;Coltrane Jazz&quot;.

Coltrane&#x27;s improvisation exemplifies the melodic phrasing that came to be known as sheets of sound, and features his explorations into third-related chord movements that came to be known as Coltrane changes. The Giant Steps chord progression consists of a distinctive set of chords that create key centers a major third apart. Jazz musicians ever since have used it as a practice piece, its difficult chord changes presenting a &quot;kind of ultimate harmonic challenge&quot;, and serving as a gateway into modern jazz improvisation. Several pieces on this album went on to become jazz standards, most prominently &quot;Naima&quot; and &quot;Giant Steps&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; selected this album as part of its suggested &quot;Core Collection&quot; calling it &quot;Trane&#x27;s first genuinely iconic record.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 102 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 103 in a 2012 revised list, and 232 in a 2020 revised list.

In 2000 it was voted number 764 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

On March 3, 1998, Rhino Records reissued &quot;Giant Steps&quot; as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included were eight bonus tracks, five of which had appeared in 1975 on the Atlantic compilation &quot;Alternate Takes&quot;, the remaining three earlier issued on &quot;The Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings&quot; in 1995.

<doc id="986840" wikidata="Q7074487" url="?curid=986840" title="Oatka Creek">
<text>Oatka Creek ( ) is the third longest tributary of the Genesee River, located entirely in the Western New York region of the U.S. state of New York. From southern Wyoming County, it flows to the Genesee near Scottsville, draining an area of that includes all or part of 23 towns and villages in Wyoming, Genesee, Livingston and Monroe counties as well. Its name means &quot;leaving the highlands&quot; or &quot;approaching an opening&quot; in Seneca.

Like its parent stream it originated during the end of the last Ice Age, as glacial impact on the upper Allegheny Plateau created a rolling landscape streams could gradually erode through, The Oatka carved a deep groove known today as the Oatka Valley, where the upper creek&#x27;s two major settlements would be established. Native Americans of the Seneca nation established a few settlements along it where clearings arose in the forest. The Revolutionary War&#x27;s Sullivan Expedition brought the valley&#x27;s fertile soil to the attention of the emerging nation, and the region was opened for settlement shortly after the war.

For a time the Oatka was called Allan&#x27;s Creek after the area&#x27;s first settler, Ebenezer &quot;Indian&quot; Allan. Its waterpower facilitated early 19th-century European settlement of the abundant fertile lands in the Holland Purchase. Today it remains an important regional resource, used for water supply and recreational purposes, and actively protected to assure water quality. It is a popular trout stream, stocked from the oldest fish hatchery in the Western Hemisphere near its mouth. A dam in Le Roy makes the section below it a losing stream, dry during the warm months of the year as the stream flows through subterranean channels.

==Course==
Several small streams, some of which ultimately rise to the north at elevations of almost , come together to create the main stem of the creek amid the fields and woodlots on the high plateau in Gainesville just south of the Warsaw town line, a short distance west of Silver Spring Road. The new stream flows first south a mile, then turns northwest paralleling the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks toward the small hamlet of Rock Glen. There it crosses for the first time New York State Route 19 (NY 19), which it will parallel closely for much of the rest of its length.

To the west of Rock Glen, it passes through the narrow gorge that gave it its name, emerging at another hamlet, Newburg, at the head of the Oatka Valley it follows for the rest of its run. Again crossing under Route 19, it has descended since its rise. From Newburg it meanders northwest, then north, staying close to the highway on the valley floor.

Several miles further downstream it enters Warsaw, the county seat. It goes under Route 19 again and trends to the west, flowing under U.S. Route 20A to pass to the west of Warsaw High School and its athletic fields. North of the village the valley widens, staying generally level. The creek and NY 19 cross again amid large cultivated fields.

The valley begins to angle northeasterly towards Wyoming, which the Oatka bypasses to the southeast into a large wooded area. It then passes through the largest wetlands along it course. North of that it crosses Route 19 again as that road turns eastward briefly. The two return to each other when they cross into Genesee County at Pavilion, where NY 63 crosses as they resume a northward heading, and there is another significant wetlands area.

In another small wood two miles (3.2 km) north of Pavilion, US 20 crosses. The creek bends west, reaching its greatest distance from Route 19, then north-northeast back to the highway&#x27;s vicinity. It enters the village of Le Roy on a northeast course, crossing Route 19 again as it widens into a reservoir behind the dam just south of NY 5.

It narrows again north of the village towards Buttermilk Falls and the section that flows underground in warm, dry weather. The valley here is broad, its walls now long and gently sloped instead of steep and short. After going over the falls, marking the Onondaga Escarpment, it turns east, leaving NY 19 a mile south of the New York State Thruway. This geologically distinct section is known as the lower Oatka. It dips south, north and then south again through a largely wooded area as it approaches Genesee Country Village and enters Monroe County near Mumford.

After bypassing that hamlet to the north, NY 383 parallels on the north and the CSX rail line across New York on the south, as the creek reaches Oatka Creek Park, a large tract of former farmland to its south. Here both road and rail are to the north of the stream, widening again. Beyond the park it enters an area of predominantly farmland again as it passes south of Scottsville, where NY 251 enters the village by bridging the Oatka. A mile further along, it empties into the Genesee.

==Watershed==

The Oatka&#x27;s basin is relatively narrow and does not extend far from the Oatka Valley or the towns through which the creek itself flows. Almost all of the towns of Warsaw, Pavilion and Le Roy are within the watershed, along with large portions of Covington, Gainesville, Middlebury and Wheatland. Most of the eastern half of Stafford is in the Oatka basin even though only a small portion of the creek flows through it.

In Livingston County Caledonia is the only town with land in the watershed, consisting mostly of its northeastern corner and most of the village of Caledonia. Other towns with no portions of the creek itself having large sections within its basin are Perry, Orangeville, and Bethany. Small portions of Castile, Wethersfield, Byron and Bergen also drain into the Oatka.

There are five villages wholly or partially within the watershed. The former are Warsaw, Wyoming and Le Roy. Closer to its mouth are Scottsville and Caledonia. These are the only concentrated areas of development and population within it. The majority (73%) of the watershed is active or inactive agricultural land. Forests cover another 21%. Most of the remainder is residential or commercial land, with industrial use accounting for just 1%.

The watershed&#x27;s highest point of is located in southeastern Orangeville; its lowest point, , is the Oatka&#x27;s mouth. Including the Oatka itself, there are of stream in the watershed.

There are few significant lakes or ponds within the watershed. The largest is Lake Le Roy, near the headwaters of Mud Creek in Pavilion. It is a reservoir that once served as the main water supply for the village of Le Roy. The only protected area in the Oatka watershed besides Oatka Creek Park is the Carlton Hill Wildlife Management Area in Middlebury, north of Warsaw.

===Water quality===
The United States Geological Survey maintains two stream gauges on the creek, at Garbutt near the mouth and Warsaw below its headwaters. Average annual streamflow is at the upstream station and downstream. Flow at Warsaw averages 21–36% of what it is at Garbutt, but is much higher downstream in springtime and after significant runoff events.

Only one community along the creek, the village of Warsaw, uses it as a water supply, putting it through a filtration plant before distributing it to residents and other customers. Its wastewater treatment plant is downstream of the intake. Le Roy also has state permits to discharge effluent into the stream from their wastewater plants, along with the Lapp Insulators plant in Le Roy and the fish hatchery in Caledonia (via the Spring Creek tributary). The latter has the highest permitted discharge of any permit in the Oatka watershed. The villages of Caledonia and Wyoming, and one of Pavilion&#x27;s water districts, use wells in the watershed.

The creek&#x27;s water quality has been extensively studied in its lower watershed, below Buttermilk Falls. Most chemicals within it are within normal limits, with slightly higher levels of sulfates due to the gypsum and dolomite present in the bedrock. Those minerals also produce detectable magnesium and strontium levels as well. Trichloroethylene is sometimes found as well, the legacy of a spill from a railroad accident near Le Roy in the early 1970s. During high-runoff events, fecal coliform in the lower Oatka sometimes exceeds permitted levels.

There are no major issues at present that could significantly degrade water quality on most of the stream. Accordingly, the state&#x27;s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) classifies the Monroe and Genesee sections of the stream as &quot;threatened&quot;, since some issues could arise in the future. The Wyoming County portion is considered &quot;stressed&quot;, in that while its quality is generally good, occasional issues arise that limit use.

In 1999, following a &quot;Caring for Creeks&quot; conference in Rochester, the Oatka Creek Watershed Committee was formed. It sponsored research into the stream and watershed, including the first &quot;State of the Basin&quot; report two years later. Intermunicipal agreements were adopted in 2004, and an outline for an Oatka Creek Watershed Management Plan was adopted in 2006, in cooperation with the Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Council.

==Wildlife==
There is limited data on the fish and plant species that thrive in and around the creek as no comprehensive survey has been done. The state has identified several communities of species it lists as rare, threatened or endangered. To protect them more effectively it has limited publication of the exact species or location of the communities.

More specific data exists on benthic macroinvertebrates, or larger organisms that depend on the sediment on the stream floor. These are primarily the immature forms of insects that live on land as adults. Many of these species, such as caddisflies and stoneflies, are pollution-intolerant and thus their presence is an indicator of good water quality. They were found during a 1989–90 survey of the lower Oatka, but in lower numbers than expected. The stream is thus considered &quot;slightly impacted&quot; by pollution.

Many of those insects constitute the food supply for various trout species. The lower Oatka is considered a blue-ribbon brown trout fishery, with some brook trout populating the water as well. The state fish hatchery on Spring Creek near Caledonia stocks the stream annually, and there is also evidence of a wild trout fishery on the stretch between Bowerman and Wheatland Center roads. A 1999 survey estimated the creek&#x27;s total trout biomass at 30 pounds per acre (33 kg per hectare) bass, walleye and northern pike have also been taken near the Genesee.

==Geology==
Buttermilk Falls divides Oatka Creek into two distinct geological regions. The upper stream&#x27;s bedrock is local sedimentary rock formations, with the shales and sandstones of the Sonyea Group, shale-limestone Genesee Group and Tully Limestone dominating from the headwaters to Pavilion. Between there and Le Roy the shales and thin limestones of the Hamilton Group underlie the creek.

North of Le Roy, the Oatka becomes a losing stream, with water disappearing into the ground. In the warmer months this results in the creekbed drying up above Buttermilk Falls, and slowly re-emerging further down from springs and seeps. After it does, and turns to the east, it flows over the Akron Formation, Bertie Group of dolomitic shales, and the Salina Group. The latter is diverse, including evaporites such as halite and gypsum in addition to its limestones and shales.

In the lower section of the creek there is significant groundwater entering the creek. As it discharges, it weathers the gypsum and limestone. This results in increased sulfates in the water, and bicarbonates and calcium have also been found near the falls. These concentrations are in winter and spring, when heavier precipitation and runoff offsets the impact of the groundwater.

==History==
As the glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago the landscape they left behind on the Allegheny Plateau was a rolling expanse of drumlins and depressions in which meltwater and precipitation could accumulate. It was ideal topography for stream formation, and these bodies of water eventually combined and became the Oatka, eroding the Oatka Valley. Fertile soil from the highlands accumulated in the valley, and the land eventually reforested.

The Native Americans who would become the Seneca nation eventually came and settled in the area. They established a few small communities at the clearings in the forest where they found good hunting, and were first to farm the lands in the valley. The network of trails that connected them eventually became part of today&#x27;s road network in the area. The Senecas eventually became part of the Iroquois Confederation, where the Oatka was at the very westernmost extent, giving them the honorific &quot;Keepers of the Western Door&quot; within the Confederation.

In 1779, during the Revolutionary War the Continental Army&#x27;s Sullivan Expedition came into Western New York to suppress Senecas who had professed loyalty to the British or might do so. Many of the troops came from farms in New England and recognized the quality of land in the Oatka watershed. After the war they agitated for it to be opened to settlement. After the war, New York and Massachusetts resolved the latter&#x27;s claim to the area, and the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree (today Geneseo) extinguished all Native land claims.

The first settler along the Oatka was Ebenezer &quot;Indian&quot; Allan, who established himself near the mouth of the stream, in today&#x27;s Wheatland, in 1786. The creek would be known as Allan&#x27;s Creek for years afterwards. After he moved further down the Genesee, other settlers came, the beginnings of what became Scottsville. In the 1790s settlement progressed upstream with the establishment of Le Roy where the stream intersected an old Indian trail that later became New York State Route 5. Settlement moved quickly afterwards, with all present communities as far south as Gainesville seeing their first settlers in the opening years of the 19th century, when the Holland Land Company owned much of it.

==River modifications==

The only significant change made to the river by human engineering is the dam at Le Roy near where Route 5 crosses the creek. It creates a lake in the center of the village. Other dams or diversions that were created for milling purposes in the 19th century have been abandoned and/or removed. There are no power plants or flood control projects along the creek.

There are 32 bridges currently spanning the creek, built between 1915 and 2003. The oldest carries Union Street in Wheatland; the newest is the NY 251 bridge into Scottsville above the creek&#x27;s mouth. Seven of them carry NY 19 over the creek. These include both the longest, the crossing over the lake created by the Le Roy dam, northernmost along Route 19, and the shortest and southernmost, its bridge south of Rock Glen. Most are steel or concrete stringer or box girder structures, with the US 20 bridge in Pavilion and one of the Route 19 bridges north of Warsaw being steel truss designs.

==Economy==
In the early days of settlement the creek contributed directly to the local economy through the mills established along it. They were removed in later years when industrialization elsewhere made them less profitable. Today the creek&#x27;s direct economic value comes from its role as a water supply and discharge for the wastewater of the two most populous villages along it, Le Roy and Warsaw.

The narrow and deep Oatka Valley was a preferred transportation corridor through eastern Wyoming and Genesee counties. First came the road that became Route 19 in 1930. In 1874 it was paralleled by the Rochester and State Line Railroad; today operated by Norfolk Southern after many ownership changes. Intersections with major east–west routes that became NY 5 and US 20A prompted the development of Le Roy and Warsaw around them.

===Recreation===
Oatka Creek&#x27;s primary direct contribution to the local economy today is as a scenic and recreational resource. The former is enhanced by the Oatka Valley. The latter consists of hiking, boating and primarily angling in three distinct fisheries.

The upper creek, above Warsaw, is stocked with 1,850 yearling brown trout in the spring of each year, supplementing an indigenous wild population. DEC surveys have found that by June few of the stocked trout remain, showing that the stretch has heavy fishing pressure. The record size for trout taken from this stretch is . DEC has not acquired any public fishing rights along the four miles () south of, but public access is relatively unhindered as there are several bridges, paralleling railroad tracks (both of which automatically create public access to adjacent areas of the stream under New York law) and the area is otherwise lightly posted against trespassing.

From Warsaw to Le Roy, the stream matures and warms. This is conducive to different species of sport fish, particularly bass, pike, sunfish, crappies and bullhead. There is access from bridges and some public land owned by municipalities in the area.

The lower Oatka is the portion most popular with fly fishermen. The groundwater infusions from the Blue Hole and falls cool the creek again; from the bend eastward to its mouth it is a freestone stream with a large population of stocked and wild brown trout. The 11,200 fry added to the waters each year come from the state fish hatchery north of Caledonia on the Oatka&#x27;s Spring Creek tributary established in 1864 by Seth Green, the oldest such facility in the Western Hemisphere. Brown trout was first introduced to American waters from it; today the of fish produced supply almost all of the state&#x27;s stocked streams.

Public access to this section is extensive. The section in Oatka Creek Park is the most frequently used, since special regulations to conserve the wild trout population there allow no-kill fishing there with artificial lures year-round. Similar rules apply between October and March in the less-accessible stretch downstream of the park to Bowerman Road; during the regular season anglers are limited to two fish per day at a minimum. Black bass and northern pike have also taken flies in those waters.

Access is also available from a small Scottsville village park on the south bank east of Route 251, the hundred feet on the other side of that highway and both sides of the NY 36 bridge near Wheatland Center, as well as 50 ft (15 m) on either side of county roads that cross the creek. DEC has also acquired public fishing easements on a small stretch in Mumford and much of both banks along Oatka Trail in the Town of Le Roy between Mud Creek and the unnamed northern tributary two miles (3.2 km) upstream. These allow use of the 33 feet (11 m) adjoining the river by anglers for access to the water. They are subject to regular DEC fishing regulations.

<text>Insubordination is the act of willfully disobeying a lawful order of one&#x27;s superior. It is generally a punishable offense in hierarchical organizations such as the armed forces, which depend on people lower in the chain of command obeying orders.

==Military==
Insubordination is when a service member willfully disobeys the lawful orders of a superior officer. If a military officer disobeys the lawful orders of their civilian superiors, this also counts. For example, the head of state in many countries, is also the most superior officer of the military as the Commander in Chief. Generally, however, an officer or soldier may disobey an unlawful order to the point of mutiny (see Nuremberg defense).

In the U.S. military, insubordination is covered under Article 91 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It covers disobeying lawful orders as well as disrespectful language or even striking a superior. The article for insubordination should not be confused with the article for contempt. While Article 91 of the UCMJ deals predominantly with disobeying or disrespecting a superior and applies to enlisted members and warrant officers, Article 88 involves the use of contemptuous words against certain appointed or elected officials and only applies to commissioned officers.

According to a 2021 typology, military disobedience can take four forms: &quot;defiance, refinement, grudging obedience, and exit.&quot; A 2019 study argued that military disobedience may arise when a tension is created in the social networks of a soldier, which gives the soldier motivations and justifications to disobey orders.

==Private sector==
Other types of hierarchical structures, especially corporations, may use insubordination as a reason for dismissal or censure of an employee.

There have been court cases in the United States which have involved charges of insubordination from the employer with counter charges of infringement of First Amendment rights from the employee. A number of these cases have reached the U.S. Supreme Court usually involving a conflict between an institution of higher education and a faculty member.

In the modern in the Western world, hierarchical power relationships are usually sufficiently internalized so that the issue of formal charges of insubordination are rare. In his book &quot;Disciplined Minds&quot;, American physicist and writer Jeff Schmidt points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained &quot;to make sure that the subtext of each and every detail of their work advances the right interests—or skewers the disfavored ones&quot; in the absence of overt control.

==Notable examples==
There have been a number of famous and notorious people who have committed insubordination or &quot;publicly&quot; objected to an organizational practice.
* Emil Bessels – German Arctic explorer who undermined and likely poisoned the &quot;Polaris&quot; expedition&#x27;s commander, Charles Francis Hall
* Daniel V. Gallery – U.S. Navy admiral whose published articles played a role in the public debate during the Revolt of the Admirals
* George Grosz – German artist and soldier
* Mike Jackson – Commanding Officer of KFOR during the Kosovo War. Countermanded an order by Wesely Clark (the Supreme Allied Commander Europe) thus avoiding an international incident at Pristina Airport.
* Douglas MacArthur – U.S. general relieved of command by President Harry S. Truman during the Korean War
* Billy Mitchell – U.S. Army Air Corps commander during World War I and proponent of air power during the interwar years
* Stanislav Petrov – Russian army officer who refused to report a detected missile strike averting nuclear war
* Albert Pike – charged by the Confederate Army with insubordination
* Jackie Robinson – American baseball player accused of insubordination while in the military, but exonerated at a court martial
* Thomas Scott – executed by Louis Riel
* Hunter S. Thompson – American writer, fired from &quot;Time&quot; magazine
* Jeffrey Wigand – vice president of Brown &amp; Williamson, revealed tobacco industry practices

<doc id="986849" wikidata="Q246501" url="?curid=986849" title="Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768)">
<text>The Treaty of Fort Stanwix was a treaty signed between representatives from the Iroquois and Great Britain (accompanied by negotiators from New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania) in 1768 at Fort Stanwix. It was negotiated between Sir William Johnson, his deputy George Croghan, and representatives of the Iroquois.

The treaty established a Line of Property following the Ohio River that ceded the Kentucky portion of the Virginia Colony to the British Crown, as well as most of what is now West Virginia. The treaty also settled land claims between the Iroquois and the Penn family; the lands acquired by American colonists in Pennsylvania were known as the New Purchase.

==Treaty==
The purpose of the conference was to adjust the boundary line between Indian lands and the Thirteen Colonies outlined in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The British government hoped a new boundary line might bring an end to the rampant frontier violence between Native Americans and American colonists. Native Americans hoped a new, permanent line might prevent further encroachment of their lands from the colonists.

The final treaty was signed on November 5 with one signatory for each of the Six Nations and in the presence of representatives from the colonies of New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as Johnson. The Native American nations present received gifts and cash totaling £10,460 7s. 3d. sterling, the highest payment ever made from the British Crown to Native Americans. The treaty established a Line of Property which extended the earlier proclamation line of the Alleghenies (the divide between the Ohio and coastal watersheds), much farther to the west. The line ran near Fort Pitt and followed the Ohio River as far as the Tennessee River, effectively ceding the Kentucky portion of the Virginia Colony to the Crown, as well as most of what is now West Virginia. The British government had recently confirmed ownership of the lands south and west of the Kanawha to the Cherokee by the Treaty of Hard Labour. During the Fort Stanwix proceedings, the British negotiators were astonished to learn that the Six Nations still maintained a nominal claim over much of Kentucky, which they wanted added into consideration. In addition, the Shawnee did not agree to this treaty, contesting colonial Virginian settlements between the Alleghenies and Ohio until the 1774 Treaty of Camp Charlotte.

Although the Six Nations of New York had previously recognized colonial rights southeast of the Ohio River at the 1752 Treaty of Logstown, they continued to claim ownership (by conquest) over all land as far south as the Tennessee River. They had reserved this territory for decades as a hunting ground. They still considered Tennessee their boundary with the Cherokee and other &quot;Southern&quot; tribes. Although representatives of the Indian nations who occupied these lands, primarily the Shawnee and Delaware, were present at the negotiations in 1768, they were not signatories. They had no fundamental role in the Iroquois&#x27; sale of their homeland. The Iroquois hoped that they could take pressure off their home territories in the New York and Pennsylvania areas by releasing Ohio lands. Rather than secure peace, the Fort Stanwix treaty helped set the stage for the next round of hostilities between Native Americans and American colonists along the Ohio River, which would culminate in Dunmore&#x27;s War.
The treaty also settled land claims between the Six Nations and the Penn family, the proprietors of Pennsylvania, where the lands acquired in 1768 were referred to as the &quot;New Purchase&quot;. Due to disputes about the physical boundaries of the settlement, however, the final treaty line would not be fully agreed upon for another five years. The final portion of the Line of Property in Pennsylvania, called the Purchase line in the State, was fixed in 1773 by representatives from the Six Nations and Pennsylvania who met at a spot called Canoe Place at the confluence of West Branch of the Susquehanna River and Cush Cushion Creek in what is now Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania.

American settlers pushing westward and opportunities for economic development turned the attention of investors and land speculators to the area west of the Appalachians. In response to demands by settlers and speculators, colonial authorities sought further land cessions from the Iroquois and Cherokee. The Treaty of Lochaber with the Cherokee followed in 1770, adjusting boundaries established in the Treaty of Hard Labour, whereby the Cherokee withdrew their claim to parts of the same country, encompassing the south part of present-day West Virginia.

<text>The Gujarati languages are a Western Indo-Aryan language family, comprising Gujarati and those Indic languages closest to it. They are ultimately descended from Shauraseni Prakrit. It is the official language of Gujarat state as well as Diu, Daman and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. It is the sixth most spoken language in India with more than 55 million speakers.

Numerous Gujarati languages are transitional between Gujarati and Sindhi. The precise relationship, if any exists, between Vaghri, the Bhil languages, Wagdi, Rajasthani, and Bagri, has not been presently elucidated.

<doc id="986853" wikidata="Q5947817" url="?curid=986853" title="Hurricane Ione">
<text>Hurricane Ione () was a strong, Category 4 hurricane that affected the U.S. state of North Carolina in September 1955, bringing high winds and significant rainfall. It came on the heels of Hurricanes Connie and Diane, and compounded problems already caused by the two earlier hurricanes. Spawned by a tropical wave which left the African coast on September 6, the system became a tropical depression in the tropical North Atlantic, before turning northwest and developing into a hurricane. After turning back to the west east of the Bahamas, Ione turned northwest and northward, moving across eastern North Carolina before moving east-northeastward out to sea. Ione caused $600 million (2005 USD) in damage, much of it to crops across North Carolina. As a result of Ione&#x27;s impacts seven people died.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave moved through Cape Verde on September 6. On September 11, Ione developed into a tropical depression. Ione remained weak for the next few days, and then began to steadily intensify as it moved north of the Lesser Antilles, reaching hurricane strength on September 15. Conditions were favorable for additional development, and Ione peaked with winds of on September 18 while north of the Bahamas.

Drier and cooler air gradually became entrained in Ione&#x27;s circulation, and the storm weakened into a Category 2 hurricane at the time of its Wilmington, North Carolina, landfall on September 19, which made Ione the third hurricane to hit the state in six weeks and fourth in 11 months. Ione was the first tropical cyclone to be observed on the Cape Hatteras radar during landfall and was one of the first observed to make small-scale oscillations within its track. The storm weakened to a tropical storm over land but restrengthened to a Category 2 hurricane over the northwestern Atlantic. Ione continued northeastward and became an extratropical cyclone on September 21. The extratropical storm crossed over Newfoundland and was last seen on September 24 moving across the North Atlantic.

==Preparations==
Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Virginia Capes to Morehead, North Carolina and a Hurricane alert was issued northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dump trucks loaded with dirt were ready to make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill, due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood. Recent flooding, from Hurricane Diane, along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike, business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose. New York City officials prepared for the worst, with police officers filling gas tanks of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty in advance of the hurricane. Flights were canceled in New York, firemen stood at the ready in Staten Island, and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm. A boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Archie Moore was delayed, which allowed the promoters to sell an additional $150,000 (1955) in tickets, which is $ in present-day figures.

When one of the first tropical cyclone forecast models was developed, Ione was chosen as one of the candidates to test out its reliability. The errors associated with Ione were significant, as the model did not forecast Ione to make landfall in North Carolina, forcing the storm eastward to the south of the state.

==Impact==

September 18 was a gloomy day in Swan Quarter, North Carolina and winds did not significantly increase until between 2 and 3 p.m. By 9:30 p.m., strong winds buffeted the area from the east-northeast and the electricity went out at around 10:50 p.m. Area homes flooded for the first time since Barbara of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season and the tides increased until 8:45 a.m. on September 19 before rapidly rising between 2:00 and 2:30 p.m. The Lake Causeway was partially washed out towards New Holland. The Diamond Shoals lightship was reported to have broken loose during the hurricane. Tides did not fully recede at Swan Quarter until 3 a.m. on September 20, with winds finally dying down after 7 a.m. the same day. Cherry Point recorded a maximum sustained wind of , with gusts to . Prolonged easterly winds forced the tide to increase to levels to above normal, which resulted in one of the largest inundations in North Carolina history. The storm surge from Ione was recorded at at Morehead City, North Carolina, while a storm tide of was measured at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. It was reported that the storm lasted for nearly two days in North Carolina.
HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot;, which had departed from Newfoundland, was laying telephone cable across the Atlantic ocean when Ione crossed its path. The ship weathered the storm, and managed to reach Scotland to complete its mission by September 26.

Ione caused $600 million (2005 USD) in damage, much of it to crops across North Carolina. The rest came from flooding in an area already devastated by Hurricanes Connie and Diane six weeks earlier. Along the Trent River near Trent and the New River near Gum Branch, North Carolina, the river stage reached heights not seen again until Hurricane Floyd of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Ione caused seven deaths in North Carolina, a low number attributed to well-executed warnings and effectiveness of relief groups such as the Red Cross.

Ione made landfall in Newfoundland, Canada during the evening of September 21 as a tropical storm and as a result cause wind and rain damage. That day the storm became extratropical, yet still had negative effects on Canada. In Carbonear a boy broke his leg after being blown into a car and thousands of dollars in damage, as well as broken poles, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and power outages were reported in St. John&#x27;s, Canada. There were also reports of roof damage and a trailer being torn for its foundation. Three flights were cancelled, schools were closed and the ferry service between Bell Island and Portugal Cove was disrupted. On September 23 there were reports of boats that had been lost and in Harbour Grace and Harbour Main. There was also a report of a garage being flipped with a car still in it. There were also reports of a street and two mines being flooded in Corner Brook and it was reported that there was $2 million damage to the province. There was extensive damage to waterfront property on the southern coast of Newfoundland. On September 24 there were reports of fishermen losing gear, a house being blown off its foundation in Foxtrap, damage to the phone company, a washed out road in Swift Current and damage to the power company. On September 27 it was reported that buoys were destroyed in Harbour Grace, Fortune and Stag Harbour. There was also damage done to a freighter in Conception Bay.

==Retirement==

Due to the damage it caused, the name &quot;Ione&quot; was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau after the 1955 season. The name will never again be used for a North Atlantic basin tropical cyclone.

<doc id="986859" wikidata="Q2279127" url="?curid=986859" title="Magical Pokémon Journey">
<text>Magical Pokémon Journey, originally published in Japan as , is a shōjo manga series set in the fictional universe of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. The manga is by Yumi Tsukirino and serialized by Shogakukan in the manga magazine &quot;Ciao&quot;, and collected in ten bound volumes. The series is not based on any particular video game, and it is the first &quot;shōjo&quot; Pokémon manga series released in the United States. The original Japanese title &quot;PiPiPi&quot; refers to &quot;Purin&quot;, &quot;Pippi&quot;, and &quot;Pikachu&quot;, the respective Japanese names of Jigglypuff, Clefairy, and Pikachu.

The main character, Hazel (Maron in Japanese), sets off to catch Pokémon after a scientist named Grandpa agrees to make a love potion if she catches Pokémon. Hazel is after the heart of a boy named Almond. Most of the Pokémon in the manga series can speak a human language. Jason Thompson, author of &quot;Manga: The Complete Guide&quot;, wrote that, based on the plot, it &quot;might as well not be about Pokémon at all&quot;.

The manga is licensed in English in North America by Viz Media and in Singapore by Chuang Yi. Viz published seven of the ten volumes flipped to the Western left-to-right format.

A spinoff series, , features the adventures and exploits of Clefairy and Pikachu, as well as Torchic and Mightyena. The chamo-chamo refers to &quot;Achamo&quot;, Torchic&#x27;s Japanese name.

==Characters==

===Humans===
:The main character of this series. She&#x27;s a bubble-headed blonde who&#x27;s madly in love with her friend Almond, and adores cute Pokémon such as Pikachu and Clefairy. As a child, she was an irrepressible tomboy who enjoyed playing pranks on Almond; now that she&#x27;s older, she&#x27;s still quite hyper, but in a more girlish way.
:The love interest of the series. He calls himself a Pokémon trainer, but it&#x27;s not known what Pokémon he has, or even if he has any besides Squirtle, who is more of a friend than a trained Pokémon. Almond shows little to no interest in either Hazel or Coconut, until the final volume...
:Grandpa&#x27;s granddaughter, and Hazel&#x27;s rival for Almond&#x27;s love. She&#x27;s a brilliant scientist, and so spends much of her time brewing love potions that backfire in some manner, usually injuring her Eevee. Later on, a man named Caraway confesses his love for Coconut, but she isn&#x27;t interested.
:Isn&#x27;t Hazel&#x27;s grandfather, as she points out to Almond when Coconut first appears. He&#x27;s simply a crazy old man whom everybody calls &quot;Grandpa&quot;. He likes to ogle young women, even though he&#x27;s married to Ginger. He made Hazel the outfit she wears much of the time; it has magical properties that can protect her from injury and even drowning. Owns POG Inc., but left because running a business isn&#x27;t fun, and Ginger took over for him.
:A sickly boy who recently moved to Hazel&#x27;s town for reasons related to his health. His Pokémon is a hotheaded Charmander. His bad health is caused by a mass of dark qi surrounding him; he is able to communicate with and control this qi, which is quite unusual.
:Peanut&#x27;s brother, a florist who has a thing for Hazel. Due to a mix-up on Viz&#x27;s website, many people believe that in the Japanese version of the manga, he&#x27;s really attracted to Almond; however, this is not true. Pistachio&#x27;s Bulbasaur, named Danerina, has a crush on him, as does Chiko the Chikorita.
:A ninja-in-training under the great ninja master Ditto. He&#x27;s a bumbling goof, though. When he&#x27;s not training, he works in his family&#x27;s bakery. Wal wears glasses when not training, and contact lenses when in ninja uniform.
:A 150-year-old ghost. When she first appears, Raichu is angry with her. Sandy&#x27;s parents left him in a box by the ocean because he had a tendency to shock people, and Sandy promised to meet him there; however, just before they could meet, they were both killed by a tidal wave. Once Sandy explains this, Raichu forgives her and they are able to &quot;cross over&quot;. They appear in later chapters to help pacify an angry Golduck ghost, and are reincarnated in the final volume.
:First appears in the eighth volume. Since only the first seven volumes were translated into English in America, most fans don&#x27;t know of her, even though she&#x27;s an important character. She is also a ninja-in-training, though she&#x27;s much more accomplished than Walnut. Her master, Azumarill, is even more talented than Ditto; Azumarill&#x27;s daughter, a Marill named Marimaru, is Koume&#x27;s partner. Apricot is addicted to bread, and winds up falling in love with Walnut.
:First appears in the ninth volume. She&#x27;s an exorcist nurse who travels around with her senior, a Chansey, exorcising bad qi. She discovers the reason for Peanut&#x27;s ill health, but she is unable to exorcise it. She falls in love with Peanut.
:First appears in the tenth and final volume. As soon as he meets Coconut, he falls for her and kisses her on the lips. Because of this, Coconut absolutely refuses to even give him a chance, until he helps her with an experiment she&#x27;s working on. After that, she becomes friends with Caraway, but still isn&#x27;t romantically interested in him.
:First appears in the seventh volume. She is Grandpa&#x27;s wife! She came to issue him a challenge &#x27;Win best inventions prize at the upcoming 
inventors contest or move back home. She has a Natu and Girafarig. She is currently running POG Inc.!
:A character featured in the spin-off series after obtaining her first Pokémon, Torchic. She is based on, or as largely same as May from Pokémon anime series, with only costumes changed.

===Pokémon characters===
:The first Pokémon to appear in this series, is Hazel&#x27;s best friend -- not surprising, as both of them can be described as scatterbrains. Pikachu is one of the few Pokémon in MPJ who cannot speak human language. Pikachu appears as a male one.
:Hazel&#x27;s second Pokémon friend, and is a scaredy cat. He dislikes battling because he views himself as weak, even though his Metronome technique is quite powerful. He also uses Minimize often, usually when he gets frightened (which can happen at the drop of a hat).
:A spoiled princess Pokémon whose family lives in a castle. Jigglypuff loves to cook, but she&#x27;s terrible at it while looks delicious at first glance. Not seeming to realize this, she gets horribly offended when nobody wants to eat the food she makes.
:The only boy Pokémon to live at the Jigglypuff mansion. He calls Almond his &quot;big brother&quot;, but at the same time seems to be absorbed by him.
:Coconut&#x27;s Pokémon and lab assistant. He&#x27;s usually in the way when her experiments go wrong, and is quite an unlucky fellow. In the sixth volume, he meets and falls in love with...
:A female Eevee. At first, she loved Eevee from afar, but she managed to confess her feelings to him at the prompting of Hazel and Coconut. Later, she has to move away, but she occasionally visits Eevee.
:Peanut&#x27;s companion, and his fiery temper is in stark contrast to the boy&#x27;s quiet personality. Charmander gets angry when things don&#x27;t go his way, which happens more often than not. At first he seemed to have a thing for Coconut&#x27;s Eevee (who is male), but in later volumes he seems more attracted to Chiko.
:Danerina is Pistachio&#x27;s Bulbasaur. She seems to be possessive and will get angry if Pistachio talks to other women.
:Wal&#x27;s ninja master. He&#x27;s a quite accomplished ninja, even though he&#x27;s just a pink blob.

<doc id="986865" wikidata="Q758137" url="?curid=986865" title="California State Route 123">
<text>State Route 123 (SR 123) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California in the San Francisco Bay Area. Named San Pablo Avenue for almost its entire length except for its northernmost , SR 123 is a major north–south state highway along the flats of the urban East Bay. Route 123 runs between Interstate 580 in Oakland in the south and Interstate 80 at Cutting Boulevard in Richmond in the north. San Pablo Avenue itself, a portion of Historic US 40, continues well past the SR 123 designation south to Downtown Oakland and north to Crockett.

==Route description==
SR 123 is a four-lane boulevard with a median strip for its entire length. Its southern terminus is at the underpass of Interstate 580 in Oakland. Going north, it passes through the cities of Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, and El Cerrito. It briefly turns on Cutting Boulevard before entering Richmond at its northern terminus under Interstate 80.

SR 123/San Pablo Avenue does not directly intersect with I-580 in Oakland, so drivers are instructed to get onto I-580 east via 35th Street, or I-80 east/I-580 west via West MacArthur Boulevard. The I-580 west on-ramp use to end just before the I-80 split at the MacArthur Maze, but was rebuilt to force traffic onto I-80 east and to prevent the merging and weaving of those trying to get onto I-80 west. Signage on I-580 does not mention SR 123; access is via I-580 west exit 19A/San Pablo Avenue/MacArthur Boulevard or I-580 east exit 19B/West Street. Signage on I-80 does not mention SR 123 either on SR 123&#x27;s official northern terminus at exit 15/Cutting Boulevard or at the San Pablo Avenue intersection further north at I-80 exit 16B.

San Pablo Avenue is sometimes used as an alternate route to the Eastshore Freeway (I-80/I-580) when that freeway becomes very congested. Major intersections along this route include 40th Street, Ashby Avenue (SR 13), University Avenue (which leads to UC Berkeley), Gilman Street, Marin Avenue, Central Avenue and Cutting Boulevard.

Continuing on San Pablo Avenue past SR 123&#x27;s southern terminus eventually leads to Downtown Oakland and Oakland City Hall where San Pablo Avenue ends. Continuing north on San Pablo Avenue after SR 123 turns west onto Cutting Boulevard in Richmond leads to the cities of San Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, Rodeo, and Crockett. In Hercules, San Pablo Avenue meets the terminus of SR 4 near I-80, and, after a discontinuity bridged by Parker Avenue in Rodeo, the road approaches the Carquinez Bridge and arrives in Crockett as Pomona Street.

An AC Transit Rapid Bus (72R-San Pablo Rapid) runs along San Pablo Avenue from Downtown Oakland to Contra Costa College in San Pablo. The express bus line was put in place after a Metropolitan Transportation Commission study determined that it would be more cost-effective than a previous proposal to install light rail along the route. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system runs its Richmond leg parallel to the route up to the El Cerrito del Norte station.

The Alvarado Adobe is located by the San Pablo City Hall on the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Church Lane.

SR 123 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
San Pablo Avenue is one of the oldest existing roads in the East Bay. It originated in the Spanish colonial era as the Camino de la Contra Costa (&quot;road of the opposite shore&quot;, i.e. opposite from the Presidio of San Francisco and the settlement around the Mission in San Francisco) and was legally a &quot;camino real&quot; (&quot;royal road&quot;, i.e., property of the Spanish crown) until Mexico won its independence in 1821. It ran from the Encinal (&quot;Oakland&quot;) landings of the Rancho San Antonio northward (actually northwestward) along the bayshore, then eastward just inland of the Carquinez Strait. It was the principal thoroughfare for the scattered ranches throughout this part of the East Bay.

The name persisted into the American era, when it was still called the &quot;Contra Costa Road&quot;. On July 15, 1852, the Court of Sessions of Contra Costa County ordered the construction of a more direct and somewhat improved road along the same general route between the Rancho San Pablo and Oakland, which consequently became known as &quot;The San Pablo Road&quot;. This segment subsequently became today&#x27;s &quot;San Pablo Avenue&quot;.

In 1927, this road was designated as part of the Lincoln Highway, the nation&#x27;s first transcontinental road, upon the opening of the new highway bridge across the Carquinez Strait.

Prior to the construction of the Eastshore Highway, San Pablo Avenue was the main north–south route through the northern East Bay, carrying the designation U.S. Route 40 north of University Avenue in Berkeley (US 40 proceeded down to the foot of University Avenue and the end of the Berkeley Pier where an auto ferry transported motorists to the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco). U.S. 40 was moved to the new highway after it was built (1930s), and about 25 years later took its current designation of Interstate 80. San Pablo Avenue was Business U.S. 40 until 1964.

During 2005–06, San Pablo Avenue was repaved and otherwise rehabilitated by Caltrans.
Portions of San Pablo Avenue, particularly in Berkeley, Albany, and El Cerrito, are slowly transforming, with a mix of shops, restaurants and condominium developments.

In the early part of the 20th century, a streetcar line ran on San Pablo between Richmond and Oakland. Part of the Oakland segment of these tracks up to Grayson Street in Berkeley were used during World War II for the Shipyard Railway of the Key System which transported workers from the Key System&#x27;s hub in Emeryville to the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond.

<doc id="986871" wikidata="Q1260023" url="?curid=986871" title="Drug test">
<text>A drug test (also often toxicology screen or tox screen) is a technical analysis of a biological specimen, for example urine, hair, blood, breath, sweat, or oral fluid/saliva—to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites. Major applications of drug testing include detection of the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport, employers and parole/probation officers screening for drugs prohibited by law (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin) and police officers testing for the presence and concentration of alcohol (ethanol) in the blood commonly referred to as BAC (blood alcohol content). BAC tests are typically administered via a breathalyzer while urinalysis is used for the vast majority of drug testing in sports and the workplace. Numerous other methods with varying degrees of accuracy, sensitivity (detection threshold/cutoff), and detection periods exist.

A drug test may also refer to a test that provides quantitative chemical analysis of an illegal drug, typically intended to help with responsible drug use.

==Detection periods==
The detection windows depend upon multiple factors: drug class, amount and frequency of use, metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, and urine pH. For ease of use, the detection times of metabolites have been incorporated into each parent drug. For example, heroin and cocaine can only be detected for a few hours after use, but their metabolites can be detected for several days in urine. The chart depicts the longer detection times of the metabolites. In the case of hair testing, the metabolytes are permanently embedded into hair, and the detection time is determined by the length of the hair sample used in the analysis. The standard length of head hair used in the test is 1.5&quot;, which corresponds to about 3 months. Body/pubic hair grows slower, and the same 1.5&quot; would result in a longer detection time.

Oral fluid or saliva testing results for the most part mimic that of blood. The only exceptions are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and benzodiazepines. Oral fluid will likely detect THC from ingestion up to a maximum period of 6–12 hours. This continues to cause difficulty in oral fluid detection of THC and benzodiazepines.

Breath air for the most part mimics blood tests as well. Due to the very low levels of substances in the breath air, liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry has to be used to analyze the sample according to a recent publication wherein 12 analytes were investigated.

Rapid oral fluid products are not approved for use in workplace drug testing programs and are not FDA cleared. Using rapid oral fluid drug tests in the workplace is prohibited in only:
* California
* Kansas
* Maine
* Minnesota
* New York
* Vermont

The following chart gives approximate detection periods for each substance by test type.

==Types==

===Urine drug screen===

Urine analysis is primarily used because of its low cost. Urine drug testing is one of the most common testing methods used. The enzyme-multiplied immune test is the most frequently used urinalysis. Complaints have been made about the relatively high rates of false positives using this test.

Urine drug tests screen the urine for the presence of a parent drug or its metabolites. The level of drug or its metabolites is not predictive of when the drug was taken or how much the patient used.

Urine drug testing is an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs which may be present in the urine specimen compete against their respective drug conjugate for binding sites on their specific antibody. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. A drug, if present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody. The antibody will then react with the drug-protein conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region of the specific drug strip.

A common misconception is that a drug test that is testing for a class of drugs, for example, opioids, will detect all drugs of that class. However, most opioid tests will not reliably detect oxycodone, oxymorphone, meperidine, or fentanyl. Likewise, most benzodiazepine drug tests will not reliably detect lorazepam. However, urine drug screens that test for a specific drug, rather than an entire class, are often available.

When an employer requests a drug test from an employee, or a physician requests a drug test from a patient, the employee or patient is typically instructed to go to a collection site or their home. The urine sample goes through a specified &#x27;chain of custody&#x27; to ensure that it is not tampered with or invalidated through lab or employee error. The patient or employee&#x27;s urine is collected at a remote location in a specially designed secure cup, sealed with tamper-resistant tape, and sent to a testing laboratory to be screened for drugs (typically the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 5 panel). The first step at the testing site is to split the urine into two . One aliquot is first screened for drugs using an analyzer that performs immunoassay as the initial screen. To ensure the specimen integrity and to detect possible adulterants, additional parameters are tested for. Some test the properties of normal urine, such as, urine creatinine, pH, and specific gravity. Others are intended to catch substances added to the urine to alter the test result, such as, oxidants (including bleach), nitrites, and gluteraldehyde. If the urine screen is positive then another aliquot of the sample is used to confirm the findings by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry methodology. If requested by the physician or employer, certain drugs are screened for individually; these are generally drugs part of a chemical class that are, for one of many reasons, considered more habit-forming or of concern. For instance, oxycodone and diamorphine may be tested, both sedative analgesics. If such a test is not requested specifically, the more general test (in the preceding case, the test for opioids) will detect most of the drugs of a class, but the employer or physician will not have the benefit of the identity of the drug.

Employment-related test results are relayed to a medical review office (MRO) where a medical physician reviews the results. If the result of the screen is negative, the MRO informs the employer that the employee has no detectable drug in the urine, typically within 24 hours. However, if the test result of the immunoassay and GC-MS are non-negative and show a concentration level of parent drug or metabolite above the established limit, the MRO contacts the employee to determine if there is any legitimate reason—such as a medical treatment or prescription.

On-site instant drug testing is a more cost-efficient method of effectively detecting substance use amongst employees, as well as in rehabilitation programs to monitor patient progress. These instant tests can be used for both urine and saliva testing. Although the accuracy of such tests varies with the manufacturer, some kits have rates of accuracy correlating closely with laboratory test results.

===Breath test===
Breath test is a widespread method for quickly determining alcohol intoxication. A breath test measures the alcohol concentration in the body by a deep-lung breath. There are different instruments used for measuring the alcohol content of an individual though their breath. Breathalyzer is a widely known instrument which was developed in 1954 and contained chemicals unlike other breath-testing instruments. More modernly used instruments are the infrared light-absorption devices and fuel cell detectors, these two testers are microprocessor controlled meaning the operator only has to press the start button.

To get accurate readings on a breath-testing device the individual must blow for approximately 6 seconds and need to contain roughly 1.1 to 1.5 liters of breath. For a breath-test to result accurately and truly an operator must take steps such as avoiding measuring &quot;mouth alcohol&quot; which is a result from regurgitation, belching, or recent intake of an alcoholic beverage. To avoid measuring &quot;mouth alcohol&quot; the operator must not allow the individual that&#x27;s taking the test to consume any materials for at least fifteen minutes before the breath test. When pulled over for a driving violation if an individual in the United States refuses to take a breath test that individual&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license can be suspended for a 6 to 12 months time period.

===Hair testing===

Hair analysis to detect addictive substances has been used by court systems in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries worldwide. In the United States, hair testing has been accepted in court cases as forensic evidence following the Frye Rule, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Daubert Rule. As such, hair testing results are legally and scientifically recognized as admissible evidence. Hair testing is commonly used in the USA as pre-employment drug test. The detection time for this test is roughly 3 months, which is the time, that takes head hair to grow ca. 1.5 inches, that are collected as a specimen. Longer detection times are possible with longer hair samples.

A 2014 collaborative US study of 359 adults with moderate-risk drug use found, that a large number of participants, who reported drug use in the last 3 months, had negative hair tests. The tests were done using an immunoassay followed by a confirmatory GC-MS.
For marijuana, only about half of self-disclosed users had a positive hair test. Under-identification of drug use by hair testing (or over-reporting) was also widespread for cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids. Because such under-identification was more common among participants, who self-reported an infrequent use, the authors suggested, that the immunoassay did not have the sensitivity required for such infrequent uses. It is worth noting, that most earlier studies reported, that hair tests found ca. 50-fold higher prevalence of illicit drug use, than self reports.

In late 2022 the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration denied a petition to recognize hair samples as an alternative (to the currently used urine samples) drug-testing method for truckers. The agency did not comment on the test validity, but rather stated, that it lacks the statutory authority to adopt new analytical methods.

Although some lower courts may have accepted hair test evidence, there is no controlling judicial ruling in either the federal or any state system declaring any type of hair test as reliable.

Hair testing is now recognized in both the UK and US judicial systems. There are guidelines for hair testing that have been published by the Society of Hair Testing (a private company in France) that specify the markers to be tested for and the cutoff concentrations that need to be tested. Addictive substances that can be detected include Cannabis, Cocaine, Amphetamines and drugs new to the UK such as Mephedrone.

====Alcohol====
In contrast to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited directly in the hair. For this reason the investigation procedure looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however with the benefit of modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).

However, there is one major difference between most drugs and alcohol metabolites in the way in which they enter into the hair: on the one hand like other drugs FAEEs enter into the hair via the keratinocytes, the cells responsible for hair growth. These cells form the hair in the root and then grow through the skin surface taking any substances with them. On the other hand, the sebaceous glands produce FAEEs in the scalp and these migrate together with the sebum along the hair shaft (Auwärter et al., 2001, Pragst et al., 2004). So these glands lubricate not only the part of the hair that is just growing at 0.3 mm per day on the skin surface, but also the more mature hair growth, providing it with a protective layer of fat.

FAEEs (nanogram = one billionth of a gram) appear in hair in almost one order of magnitude lower than (the relevant order of magnitude of) EtG (picogram = one trillionth of a gram). It has been technically possible to measure FAEEs since 1993, and the first study reporting the detection of EtG in hair was done by Sachs in 1993.

In practice, most hair which is sent for analysis has been cosmetically treated in some way (bleached, permed etc.). It has been proven that FAEEs are not significantly affected by such treatments (Hartwig et al., 2003a). FAEE concentrations in hair from other body sites can be interpreted in a similar fashion as scalp hair (Hartwig et al., 2003b).

===Presumptive substance testing===
Presumptive substance tests attempt to identify a suspicious substance, material or surface where traces of drugs are thought to be, instead of testing individuals through biological methods such as urine or hair testing. The test involves mixing the suspicious material with a chemical in order to trigger a color change to indicate if a drug is present. Most are now available over-the-counter for consumer use, and do not require a lab to read results.

Benefits to this method include that the person who is suspected of drug use does not need to be confronted or aware of testing. Only a very small amount of material is needed to obtain results, and can be used to test powder, pills, capsules, crystals, or organic material. There is also the ability to detect illicit material when mixed with other non-illicit materials. The tests are used for general screening purposes, offering a generic result for the presence of a wide range of drugs, including Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Ecstasy/MDMA, Methadone, Ketamine, PCP, PMA, DMT, MDPV, and may detect rapidly evolving synthetic designer drugs. Separate tests for Marijuana/Hashish are also available.

There are five primary color-tests reagents used for general screening purposes. The Marquis reagent turns into a variety of colors when in the presence of different substances. Dille-Koppanyi reagent uses two chemical solutions which turns a violet-blue color in the presence of barbiturates. Duquenois-Levine reagent is a series of chemical solutions that turn to the color of purple when the vegetation of marijuana is added. Van Urk reagent turns blue-purple when in the presence of LSD. Scott test&#x27;s chemical solution shows up as a faint blue for cocaine base.

In recent years, the use of presumptive test kits in the criminal justice system has come under great scrutiny due to the lack to forensic studies, questioned reliability, rendering of false positives with legal substances, and wrongful arrests.

===Saliva drug screen / Oral fluid-based drug screen===
Saliva / oral fluid-based drug tests can generally detect use during the previous few days. It is better at detecting very recent use of a substance. THC may only be detectable for 2–24 hours in most cases. On site drug tests are allowed per the Department of Labor.

Detection in saliva tests begins almost immediately upon use of the following substances, and lasts for approximately the following times:

* Alcohol: 6-12 h
* Marijuana: 1-24h

A disadvantage of saliva based drug testing is that it is not approved by FDA or SAMHSA for use with DOT / Federal Mandated Drug Testing. Oral fluid is not considered a bio-hazard unless there is visible blood; however, it should be treated with care.

===Sweat drug screen===
Sweat patches are attached to the skin to collect sweat over a long period of time (up to 14 days). These are used by child protective services, parole departments, and other government institutions concerned with drug use over long periods, when urine testing is not practical.

There are also surface drug tests that test for the metabolite of parent drug groups in the residue of drugs left in sweat. An example of a rapid, non-invasive, sweat-based drug test is fingerprint drug screening. This 10 minute fingerprint test is in use by a variety of organisations in the UK and beyond, including within workplaces, drug treatment and family safeguarding services at airport border control (to detect drug mules) and in mortuaries to assist in investigations into cause of death.

===Blood===
Drug-testing a blood sample measures whether or not a drug or a metabolite is in the body at a particular time. These types of tests are considered to be the most accurate way of telling if a person is intoxicated. Blood drug tests are not used very often because they need specialized equipment and medically trained administrators.

Depending on how much marijuana was consumed, it can usually be detected in blood tests within six hours of consumption. After six hours has passed, the concentration of marijuana in the blood decreases significantly. It generally disappears completely within 30 days.

===Random drug testing===
Can occur at any time, usually when the investigator has reason to believe that a substance is possibly being used by the subject by behavior or immediately after an employee-related incident occurs during work hours. Testing protocol typically conforms to the national medical standard, candidates are given up to 120 minutes to reasonably produce a urine sample from the time of commencement (in some instances this time frame may be extended at the examiner&#x27;s discretion).

===Diagnostic screening===
In the case of life-threatening symptoms, unconsciousness, or bizarre behavior in an emergency situation, screening for common drugs and toxins may help find the cause, called a &quot;toxicology test&quot; or &quot;tox screen&quot; to denote the broader area of possible substances beyond just self-administered drugs. These tests can also be done post-mortem during an autopsy in cases where a death was not expected. The test is usually done within 96 hours (4 days) after the desire for the test is realized. Both a urine sample and a blood sample may be tested. A blood sample is routinely used to detect ethanol/methanol and ASA/paracetamol intoxication. Various panels are used for screening urine samples for common substances, e.g. &quot;triage 8&quot; that detects amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, cannabis, barbiturates and tricyclic antidepressants. Results are given in 10–15 min.

Similar screenings may be used to evaluate the possible use of date rape drugs. This is usually done on a urine sample.

===Optional harm reduction scheme===
Drug checks/tests (also known as pill testing) are provided at some events such as concerts and music festivals. Attendees can voluntarily hand over a sample of any drug or drugs in their possession to be tested to check what the drug is and its purity. The scheme is used as a harm reduction technique so people are more aware of what they are taking and the potential risks.

===Occupational harm reduction strategies===
Drug and alcohol impairment while at work increases the risk of work-place accidents and decreases productivity. Employers such as the commercial driving and airline industry may conduct random drug tests on employees with the goal of deterring use to improve safety. There is some evidence that increasing the use of random drug testing in the airline industry reduces the percentage of people who test positive, however, it is unclear if this decrease is associated with a corresponding decrease in fatal or non-fatal injuries, other accidents, number of days absent from work. It is also not clear if there are other unwanted side effects that may result from random drug and alcohol testing in the workplace.

==Commonly tested substances==

===Anabolic steroids===
Anabolic steroids are used to enhance performance in sports and as they are prohibited in most high-level competitions drug testing is used extensively in order to enforce this prohibition. This is particularly so in individual (rather than team) sports such as athletics and cycling.

==Methodologies==
Before testing samples, the tamper-evident seal is checked for integrity. If it appears to have been tampered with or damaged, the laboratory rejects the sample and does not test it.

Next, the sample must be made testable. Urine and oral fluid can be used &quot;as is&quot; for some tests, but other tests require the drugs to be extracted from urine. Strands of hair, patches, and blood must be prepared before testing. Hair is washed in order to eliminate second-hand sources of drugs on the surface of the hair, then the keratin is broken down using enzymes. Blood plasma may need to be separated by centrifuge from blood cells prior to testing. Sweat patches are opened and the sweat collection component is removed and soaked in a solvent to dissolve any drugs present.

Laboratory-based drug testing is done in two steps. The first step is the screening test, which is an immunoassay based test applied to all samples. The second step, known as the confirmation test, is usually undertaken by a laboratory using highly specific chromatographic techniques and only applied to samples that test positive during the screening test. Screening tests are usually done by immunoassay (EMIT, ELISA, and RIA are the most common). A &quot;&quot; drug testing method which could provide screening test capabilities to field investigators has been developed at the University of Illinois.

After a suspected positive sample is detected during screening, the sample is tested using a confirmation test. Samples that are negative on the screening test are discarded and reported as negative. The confirmation test in most laboratories (and all SAMHSA certified labs) is performed using mass spectrometry, and is precise but expensive. False positive samples from the screening test will almost always be negative on the confirmation test. Samples testing positive during both screening and confirmation tests are reported as positive to the entity that ordered the test. Most laboratories save positive samples for some period of months or years in the event of a disputed result or lawsuit. For workplace drug testing, a positive result is generally not confirmed without a review by a Medical Review Officer who will normally interview the subject of the drug test.

===Urine drug testing===
Urine drug test kits are available as on-site tests, or laboratory analysis. Urinalysis is the most common test type and used by federally mandated drug testing programs and is considered the Gold Standard of drug testing. Urine based tests have been upheld in most courts for more than 30 years. However, urinalysis conducted by the Department of Defense has been challenged for reliability of testing the metabolite of cocaine. There are two associated metabolites of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZ) and ecgonine methyl ester (EME), the first (BZ) is created by the presence of cocaine in an aqueous solution with a pH greater than 7.0, while the second (EME) results from the actual human metabolic process. The presence of EME confirms actual ingestion of cocaine by a human being, while the presence of BZ is indicative only. BZ without EME is evidence of sample contamination, however, the US Department of Defense has chosen not to test for EME in its urinalysis program.

A number of different analyses (defined as the unknown substance being tested for) are available on Urine Drug Screens.

===Spray drug testing===
Spray (sweat) drug test kits are non-invasive. It is a simple process to collect the required specimen, no bathroom is needed, no laboratory is required for analysis, and the tests themselves are difficult to manipulate and relatively tamper-resistant. The detection window is long and can detect recent drug use within several hours.

There are also some disadvantages to spray or sweat testing. There is not much variety in these drug tests, only a limited number of drugs can be detected, prices tend to be higher, and inconclusive results can be produced by variations in sweat production rates in donors. They also have a relatively long specimen collection period and are more vulnerable to contamination than other common forms of testing.

===Hair drug testing===
Hair drug testing is a method that can detect drug use over a much longer period of time than saliva, sweat or urine tests. Hair testing is also more robust with respect to tampering. Thus, hair sampling is preferred by the US military and by many large corporations, which are subject to Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988.

Head hair normally growth at the rate of 0.5 inches per month. Thus, the most common hair sample length of 1.5&quot; from the scalp would detect drug use within the last 90-100 days. 80-120 strands of hair are sufficient for the test. In the absence of hair on the head, body hair can be used as an acceptable substitute. This includes facial hair, the underarms, arms, and legs or even pubic hair. Because body hair usually grows slower than head hair, drugs can often be detected in body hair for longer periods, e.g. up to 12 months. Currently, most entities that use hair testing have prescribed consequences for individuals removing hair to avoid a hair drug test.

Most drugs are analysed in hair samples not as the original psychoactive molecules, but rather as their metabolytes. For example, ethanol is determined as ethyl glucuronide, while cocaine use is confirmed using ecgonine. Testing for metabolytes reduces the likelihood of false positive results due to contamination. One disadvantage of hair testing is, that it cannot detect recent drug use, because it takes at least a week after a drug intake for the metabolytes to show up in a growing hair above the skin. Urine tests are better suited for detecting recent (within a week) drug use.

In a practical test, hair sample is usually washed with a low polarity solvent (such as dichloromethane) to remove surface contaminations. Then, the sample is pulverized and extracted with a more polar solvent, such as methanol.

Although thousand different substances can be determined in a single gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry experiment, due to the low concentration of analytes, practical measurements (see selective ion monitoring) are limited to a smaller number (10-20) of analytes. Designer drugs are usually missed in such measurements, because the analyst must know in advance what chemicals to look for.

Most hair testing laboratories use the aforementioned chromato-mass-spectrometry methods for confirmation or for rarely tested drugs only. Mass screening (preliminary or final) is usually done with immunoassays, because of their lower cost.

==Legality, ethics and politics==
The results of federally mandating drug testing were similar to the effects of simply extending to the trucking industry the right to perform drug tests, and it has been argued that the latter approach would have been as effective at lower cost.

Psychologist Tony Buon has criticized the use of workplace drug testing on a number of grounds, including:

# Flawed technology: The real world performance of testing is much lower than that claimed by its promoters. Buon suggest that tests are probably adequate for rehabilitation and treatment situations, possibly adequate for pre-employment situations, but not for dismissing employees.
# Ethical Issues: Because of the fairly simple ways that an employee can invalidate the test, drug testing must be strictly monitored. This means that the specimen must be observed leaving the body. Many legal objections currently being raised in the courts about drug testing are pointing to legal requirements of prior notice, consent, due process, and cause.
# Wrong focus: As has been shown with Employee Assistance Programs, the focus of management concern should be on work performance decline. Buon suggests effective management practices are an infinitely better approach to managing workplace alcohol and other drug issues.

Tony Buon has also reported by the CIPD as stating that &quot;drug testing captures the stupid—experienced drug users know how to beat the tests&quot;.

From a penological standpoint, one purpose of drug testing is to help classify the
people taking the drug test within risk groups so that those who pose more of a danger to the public can be incapacitated through incarceration or other restrictions on liberty. Thus, the drug testing serves a crime control purpose even if there is no expectation of rehabilitating the drug user through treatment, deterring drug use through sanctions, or sending a message that drug use is a deviant behavior that will not be tolerated.

===United Kingdom===
A study in 2004 by the Independent Inquiry into Drug Testing at Work found that attempts by employers to force employees to take drug tests could potentially be challenged as a violation of privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998 and Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. However, this does not apply to industries where drug testing is a matter of personal and public safety or security rather than productivity.

===United States===
In consultation with Dr. Carlton Turner, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12564. In doing so, he instituted mandatory drug-testing for all safety-sensitive executive-level and civil-service Federal employees. This was challenged in the courts by the National Treasury Employees Union. In 1988, this challenge was considered by the US Supreme Court. A similar challenge resulted in the Court extending the drug-free workplace concept to the private sector. These decisions were then incorporated into the White House Drug Control Strategy directive issued by President George H.W. Bush in 1989. All defendants serving on federal probation or federal supervised release are required to submit to at least three drug tests. Failing a drug test can be construed as possession of a controlled substance, resulting in mandatory revocation and imprisonment.

There have been inconsistent evaluation results as to whether continued pretrial drug testing has beneficial effects.

Testing positive can lead to bail not being granted, or if bail has already been granted, to bail revocation or other sanctions. Arizona also adopted a law in 1987 authorizing mandatory drug testing of felony arrestees for the purpose of informing the pretrial release decision, and the District of Columbia has had a similar law since the 1970s. It has been argued that one of the problems with such testing is that there is often not enough time between the arrest and the bail decision to confirm positive results using GC/MS technology. It has also been argued that such testing potentially implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the right to due process (including the prohibition against gathering evidence in a manner that shocks the conscience or constitutes outrageous government conduct), and the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment.

According to Henriksson, the anti-drug appeals of the Reagan administration &quot;created an environment in which many employers felt compelled to implement drug testing programs because failure to do so might be perceived as condoning drug use. This fear was easily exploited by aggressive marketing and sales forces, who often overstated the value of testing and painted a bleak picture of the consequences of failing to use the drug testing product or service being offered.&quot; On March 10, 1986, the Commission on Organized Crime asked all U.S. companies to test employees for drug use. By 1987, nearly 25% of the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies used drug tests.

According to an uncontrolled self-report study done by DATIA and Society for Human Resource Management in 2012 (sample of 6,000 randomly selected human resource professionals), human resource professionals reported the following results after implementing a drug testing program: 19% of companies reported a subjective increase in employee productivity, 16% reported a decrease in employee turnover (8% reported an increase), and unspecified percentages reported decreases in absenteeism and improvement of workers&#x27; compensation incidence rates.

According to US Chamber of Commerce 70% of all illicit drug users are employed. Some industries have high rates of employee drug use such as construction (12.8%), repair (11.1%), and hospitality (7.9-16.3%).

===Australia===
A person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU—the new term that includes employers) has duties under the work health and safety (WHS) legislation to ensure a worker affected by alcohol or other drugs does not place themselves or other persons at risk of injury while at work. Workplace policies and prevention programs can help change the norms and culture around substance use.

All organisations—large and small—can benefit from an agreed policy on alcohol and drug misuse that applies to all workers. Such a policy should form part of an organisations overall health and safety management system. PCBUs are encouraged to establish a policy and procedure, in consultation with workers, to constructively manage alcohol and other drug related hazards in their workplace. A comprehensive workplace alcohol and other drug policy should apply to everyone in the workplace and include prevention, education, counselling and rehabilitation arrangements. In addition, the roles and responsibilities of managers and supervisors should be clearly outlined.

All Australian workplace drug testing must comply with Australian standard AS/NZS4308:2008.

In Victoria, roadside saliva tests detect drugs that contain:
* THC (Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol), the active component in cannabis.
* methamphetamine, also known as &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;crystal&quot; and &quot;crank&quot;.
* MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is known as ecstasy.

In February 2016 a New South Wales magistrate &quot;acquitted a man who tested positive for cannabis&quot;. He had been arrested and charged after testing positive during a roadside drug test, despite not having smoked for nine days. He was relying on advice previously given to him by police.

==Refusal==
In the United States federal criminal system, refusing to take a drug test triggers an automatic revocation of probation or supervised release.

In Victoria, Australia the driver of the car has the option to refuse the drug test. Refusing to undergo a drug test or refusing to undergo a secondary drug test after the first one, triggers an automatic suspension and disqualification for a period of two years and a fine of AUD$1000. The second refusal triggers an automatic suspension and disqualification for a period of four years and an even larger fine.

===Historical cases===
* In 2000, an Australian Mining Company South Blackwater Coal Ltd with 400 employees, imposed drug-testing procedures, and the trade unions advised their members to refuse to take the tests, partly because a positive result does not necessarily indicate present impairment; the workers were stood-down by the company without pay for a week.
* In 2003, sixteen members of the Chicago White Sox considered refusing to take a drug test, in hopes of making steroid testing mandatory.
* In 2006, Levy County, Florida, volunteer librarians resigned en masse rather than take drug tests.
* In 2010, Iranian super heavyweight class weightlifters refused to submit to a drug test authorized by the Iran Weightlifting League.

<text>Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. Janet was also the first named storm to cause 1,000 deaths and the first Category 5 storm name to be retired. The eleventh tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the year, Janet formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. Moving westward across the Caribbean Sea, Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of . The intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal, Mexico on September 28. After weakening over the Yucatán Peninsula, it moved into the Bay of Campeche, where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29. Janet quickly weakened over Mexico&#x27;s mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30.

In its developmental stages, Janet caused $7.8 million in damage to the Lesser Antilles and 189 deaths in the Grenadines and Barbados. While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all hands. This remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas of Quintana Roo and British Honduras. Only five buildings in Chetumal, Mexico remained intact after the storm, and an estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. At Janet&#x27;s second landfall near Veracruz, significant river flooding ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the month. The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in the Tampico area, leading to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States.

Janet&#x27;s landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was the first recorded instance of a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic making landfall on a continental mainland; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category 5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands. Janet&#x27;s minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second-lowest-recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. At least 1,023 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8 million in damages.

==Meteorological history==

A weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the Air France and Iberia airlines east of the Lesser Antilles early on September 21. Although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a tropical wave near Cape Verde, the Weather Bureau considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from the islands. At 1800 UTC on September 21, while it was located east-southeast of Martinique, the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the Weather Bureau to classify it as Tropical Storm Janet, the tenth named storm of the season. Upon classification, Janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west. On September 22, Janet attained hurricane strength, and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across the Windward Islands. By 1200 UTC that day, Janet already attained Category 3 hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of , before stalling in intensification.

Shortly after 1700 UTC on September 22, the eye of Janet passed south of Barbados as a Category 1 Hurricane. A reconnaissance flight into the hurricane discovered that the Hurricane Janet&#x27;s eye measured only in diameter, with gale-force winds extending away from the center of circulation. The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of . After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September 23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to by 1200 UTC on September 23. A U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September 24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands. However, the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions, regaining major hurricane strength by 1200 UTC on September 24 and subsequently Category 4 hurricane intensity by the next day.
While trekking across the central Caribbean Sea, Janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the Windward Islands, with gale-force winds extending out from the center by September 25. Remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the Caribbean, a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of September 25–26 indicated strong rainbands with frequent lightning strikes and a well-defined eye, evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying. As it neared the Yucatán Peninsula on September 26, Janet began accelerating in forward speed. After the reconnaissance flight &quot;Snowcloud Five&quot; was lost while making a penetration into the hurricane&#x27;s eye, another flight early on September 27 reported a minimum pressure of , with winds in excess of &quot;by a large and incalculable amount.&quot; The hurricane was estimated to have intensified to Category 5 hurricane intensity—the highest rating on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—at 1700 UTC on September 27, shortly before passing over the Swan Islands. Janet continued to intensify afterwards, eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of , with gale-force winds having expanded to at least away from the center of the hurricane. Janet maintained peak intensity as it made landfall in extreme southern Quintana Roo, Mexico, just east of Chetumal, Mexico. In that city, an anemometer at the airport reported winds of before being blown away, and a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of in the eye of Janet. At the time, this was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling Atlantic hurricane, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, though Janet was later surpassed by hurricanes Dean and Gilbert, which also made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as Category 5 hurricanes.

Once over land, Janet considerably weakened to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of . After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula with a forward speed of , the hurricane emerged into the Bay of Campeche by 1600 UTC on September 28. The weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the Bay of Campeche to a secondary peak intensity of with a minimum central pressure of . Janet eventually made its final landfall north of the city of Veracruz by 2200 UTC on September 29 as a Category 2 hurricane. After moving inland, the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of Mexico, and as a result the Weather Bureau issued its last advisory on Janet. The weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by September 30, and later dissipated over central Mexico by 0600 UTC that day. Janet&#x27;s remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of Mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on October 1.

==Preparations==

===Caribbean Islands===
Upon Janet&#x27;s formation east of the Windward Islands, the Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution. After a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested, hurricane warnings were issued at 1600 UTC on September 22 for the entirety of the Lesser Antilles from Saint Lucia to Grenada, including Barbados. Storm warnings were issued for all islands in the Windward Islands from Saint Lucia south to Tobago, excluding St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All warnings in the Windward Antilles remained in effect until 1000 UTC on September 22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the Windward Islands, storm warnings were issued for the ABC islands and the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela at 0200 UTC on September 23. After Janet passed north of the islands, all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of September 25. The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.

===Yucatán Peninsula and Mexico===
The Weather Bureau first began cautioning areas of Central America at 1600 UTC on September 26, advising people in areas of northeast Nicaragua and Honduras to take precautionary measures, along with all vessels and small craft in the Gulf of Honduras south to Cabo Gracias a Dios. After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in British Honduras and Quintana Roo of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas of Central America, advisories published by the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane&#x27;s path up until landfall. Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters. After the hurricane moved through the Yucatán Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the Weather Bureau alerted areas in the storm&#x27;s path on the western side of Mexico&#x27;s Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and Tuxpan. Areas were warned of the storm&#x27;s potential flooding and coastal impacts. The Weather Bureau advised all small craft south of Port O&#x27;Connor, Texas to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.

==Impact==
During its existence, areas of the Lesser Antilles, ABC islands, and Central America were affected by Janet. At least $65.8 million in damages and 1,023 deaths were caused by the hurricane, mostly in Quintana Roo. The large number of deaths and damage caused by Janet helped make the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season the deadliest and costliest hurricane season documented since comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942.

===Lesser Antilles===
As a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September 22, becoming the first hurricane to strike the island in 57 years, since the 1898 Windward Islands Hurricane, until Hurricane Elsa struck the island in 2021. Maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between . The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island, though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio. Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm. Sugar cane, the island country&#x27;s main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1 million. Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds. An estimated 8,100 homes were damaged by the hurricane. The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways, and the Seawell Airport was forced to close. Heavy rains peaked at and a storm surge of swept away low-lying houses along the coast. An estimated 2,000 people were left homeless due to the hurricane. Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5 million, and at least 57 people were killed.

On September 23 Janet passed directly between Grenada and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122 people in the island chain. An airport on Grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George&#x27;s, Grenada. Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George&#x27;s were torn off. All bridges in the island&#x27;s interior regions collapsed, and spice crops sustained heavy damage. An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed, along with nearly all of the island&#x27;s banana and cocoa crops. Three ships were also grounded in the local harbor. In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George&#x27;s, debris was scattered and an pier collapsed. St. Vincent was mostly destroyed, and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage. Over $2.8 million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines. Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.

Hurricane Janet skirted the ABC islands with strong winds as it passed to the north from September 24–25. In Aruba, gusts peaked at , uprooting trees. However, damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant. In Bonaire, piers were destroyed, and the island&#x27;s coastal boulevard was damaged. Beach facilities at Curaçao&#x27;s Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.

====Snowcloud Five====
On September 26, the hurricane hunter P2V-3W Neptune aircraft Snowcloud Five, led by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Grover B. Windham, was sent from Guantánamo Bay to investigate Janet, which was at the time a Category 4 hurricane south of Jamaica. Upon penetration of the hurricane&#x27;s eyewall at an altitude of , a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the Caribbean Sea. All 11 people on board, including nine crew members and two journalists, were killed. Following the loss of the plane, an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the Caribbean Sea, with 3,000 personnel involved with the search, returning no results. The exact cause of the crash remains unknown, though it is speculated that the plane&#x27;s altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure or that the excess workload placed on one of the crew members due to another crew member having been replaced by one of the reporters caused him to lose track of the plane&#x27;s height above the water. Although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943, Snowcloud Five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the Atlantic basin, with the other three occurring as a result of Pacific typhoons.

=== Yucatán Peninsula ===

As it approached the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet passed over the Swan Islands north of Honduras as a Category 5 hurricane on September 27. The hurricane caused rough seas, and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas. After gusts exceeded an estimated , officials on the islands took shelter in a Navy seismograph building. Though no deaths were reported, Janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands. The U.S. Weather Bureau and Civil Aeronautics Authority requested food and supplies for 82 people on the island after the storm passed.

====Quintana Roo====
After passing the Swan Islands, Janet made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700 UTC on September 28. At the time, it had winds of . Hurricane-force winds were reported for two hours preceding the hurricane&#x27;s landfall, with numerous pressure readings below . Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to Janet. In Xcalak, Quintana Roo the strong winds from Janet flattened the port&#x27;s infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm&#x27;s passage. 97 people were killed in Xcalak, constituting more than a third of the port&#x27;s population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water to a depth of , inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120 bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000 people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40 million in damages and at least 500 deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.

====British Honduras====
Making landfall near the border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony&#x27;s Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500 at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30% of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631 million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was expected to have a 20% decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras&#x27; offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.

In Corozal Town, British Honduras, south of where Janet made landfall, 500 people were made homeless, and six people were killed. About 90% of all buildings in the town were destroyed, and communications were knocked out by the strong winds. Based on an average home cost of $2,000, it was estimated that property damage to homes in Corozal Town totaled $800,000. Much of Santa Elena, British Honduras was also flattened by the strong winds. Farther south in Belize City, winds peaked at , though no damage was reported. In British Honduras, the hurricane&#x27;s effects were less deadly than in Quintana Roo, but in northern portions of the colony the storm killed 16 people and caused $5 million in damages.

===Mainland Mexico===
While in the Bay of Campeche, the shrimp boat &quot;Celestino Arias&quot; was sunken by strong waves generated by Janet after it suffered engine failures. The stranded ship was heavily damaged by the hurricane&#x27;s strong winds in the bay, which broke towing lines. All of the ship&#x27;s crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued and brought back to Tampa, Florida. Along the coast, tides were reported to be above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.

Janet made its final landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz between the cities of Nautla and Veracruz as a Category 2 hurricane at 2200 UTC on September 29. In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans to be one of the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In Tampico, of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000 people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000 people were being cared for in concentration centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city&#x27;s main streets and port. Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.

Farther inland, as Janet dissipated over the mountainous central Mexico, the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the Tamesí and Pánuco River basins. The water levels in the Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks. In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets. According to some sources, 800 people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city. Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River. The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12 people. Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800 people in the town to evacuate. Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated to amount to $12 million in damages. Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200 million, nearly half of the government&#x27;s 1955 national budget. Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates, at least 1,000 people were injured and another 100,000 people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due to Janet.

==Aftermath==

===Lesser Antilles===
After Janet passed Barbados, the island was declared to be in a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955 Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.

In Grenada, the island&#x27;s governor issued an emergency order against the hoarding of food in the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later announced that it would send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.

===British Honduras and Mexico===

Relief and reconstruction measures were enacted in the British Honduras beginning on September 30. A large-scale reconstruction program was initiated by the government to help rebuild 48 villages. The government also declared a state of emergency for Corozal, Orange Walk, and Belize administrative districts, including a ban on liquor sales. Temporary communication lines were rebuilt, which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas. Due to the severity of the damage in Corozal, an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently. Food depots in Corozal, Louisville, and Orange Walk Town were tasked with distributing food. The potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by Janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas. The Jamaican government sent £20,000 (US$55,000) to the colony in relief funds, while the British government sent £40,000 (US$110,000) to affected areas in the British Honduras and other affected islands in the Caribbean. The United States sent the cargo ship USS &quot;Antares&quot;, which supplied the colony with various relief materials. In Corozal Town, a $3.5 million grant was given to land surveyor H.C. Fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township.

A U.S. Navy relief plane was sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other relief supplies after Janet struck the region. In areas previously affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, relief measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees. The United States initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and relief agencies, including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the relief efforts. The U.S. Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the Tampico area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October 1. Ten other military transport aircraft from the U.S. Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims. Helicopters were sent from the USS &quot;Saipan&quot; to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies, including the USS &quot;Siboney&quot;, which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts. By October 6, 1,500 people were estimated to have been rescued from the Tampico area, and at least of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city. There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure. Former president Manuel Ávila Camacho died of a heart ailment, in part due to over-exertion in helping in the relief efforts.

=== Retirement ===
Due to the destruction left in its wake, the name &quot;Janet&quot; was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau following the 1955 season. It was one of four names retired that year. &quot;Janet&quot; was also the first category five storm name and the first name beginning with the letter J to retire in the Atlantic basin. 

The name &quot;Janet&quot; appeared on the designated storm name lists for 1960, 1964, and 1968 but was never used in those years. In 1969, a policy change permanently retired &quot;Janet&quot;. No name replacement was selected for &quot;Janet&quot; as the four-year lists used then were replaced in 1971 by a new series of 10 lists running through 1980 before recycling.

<text>The Tribal or F class was a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy. Twelve ships were built between 1905 and 1908 and all saw service during World War I, where they saw action in the North Sea and English Channel as part of the 6th Flotilla and Dover Patrols.

==Design==
The preceding River- or E-class destroyers of 1903 had made on the provided by triple expansion steam engines and coal-fired boilers, although was powered by steam turbines. In November 1904, the First Sea Lord &quot;Jackie&quot; Fisher proposed that the next class of destroyers should make at least and should use oil-fired boilers and steam turbines as a means of achieving this. This resulted in a larger ship to provide the required doubling of installed power over their predecessors, but also pushed the design to the limits of capability of contemporary technology. As a result, the Tribals were severely compromised and a somewhat retrograde step after the successful River class; they were lightly built and proved to be fragile in service. More alarmingly however, they were only provided with 90 tons of bunkerage, and with high fuel consumption resulting from a high power output of , they were highly uneconomical and had a severely limited radius of action; &quot;Afridi&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; once used 9.5 tons of oil each simply to raise steam for a three-mile (5 km) return journey to a fuel depot.

Design details were left to the individual builders, as was Royal Navy practice at the time for destroyers. As a result, no two were alike and there was considerable heterogeneity of detail and appearance. Most noticeably the number of funnels varied from three, in &quot;Cossack&quot; and &quot;Ghurka&quot;, to six in &quot;Viking&quot;; the latter, with two single and two pairs of funnels becoming the only six-funneled destroyer ever built. With a light mainmast aft, they were the first British destroyers to have two masts.

The first five ships were designed with the armament of three QF 12-pounder guns, an improvement from the single 12-pounder and five 6-pounder guns that the River class was completed with, while the number of torpedoes remained at two tubes. From the sixth ship (&quot;Saracen&quot;) onwards, however, the armament was again increased, to a pair of BL guns, with one gun mounted forward and another on the quarterdeck. From October 1908, the first five ships were modified by adding another pair of 12 pounder guns.

The shift towards the larger Tribals also created a requirement for a complementary class of smaller &quot;Coastal&quot; destroyers giving rise to the &quot;Cricket&quot; class of small TBD, of which 36 were built between 1905 and 1908. The result of this experiment was not ideal and for the following class of destroyers (the &#x27;G&#x27;, or &quot;Beagle&quot;, class) the Admiralty reverted to a single, more uniform design for the 1908-9 programme.

==Ships==
Seven ships to the Admiralty specification were originally envisaged, but only five vessels were ordered and built under the 1905-06 Programme, all to their builders&#x27; own designs.
Five more vessels were proposed, but only two were ordered and built under the 1906-07 Programme.
A final five vessels were ordered and built under the 1907-08 Programme.
In October 1916, it was proposed on 8 November 1916 that the two undamaged &#x27;ends&#x27; might be joined together, which was completed at Chatham Royal Dockyard 7 June 1917 by joining the undamaged fore section of &quot;Zulu&quot; and the rear section of &quot;Nubian&quot; respectively. The resulting destroyer was commissioned on 7 June 1917 as , which was sold for scrapping 1919.

<text>Hurricane Gracie was a powerful hurricane that formed in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The system was first noted as an area of thunderstorms east of the Lesser Antilles which moved just north of the Greater Antilles, quickly intensifying into a hurricane on September 22. Gracie was a storm that was very difficult to forecast, with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.

==Meteorological history==

An area of squally weather was first noted a few hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles on September 18. The convective area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper-level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.

Gracie quickly strengthened and reached its peak of winds on September 29, but cooler air and land interaction weakened it slightly to a 130 mph (215 km/h) Category 4 major hurricane at the time of its landfall at 1625 UTC over St. Helena Sound near the south end of Edisto Island in South Carolina. After landfall, Gracie moved inland and north and became extratropical on September 30. Gracie&#x27;s remnants persisted for several days as they slowly turned northeastward and then eastward. Gracie&#x27;s remnants emerged into the Atlantic on October 2, before dissipating later that day.

==Preparations==
A hurricane watch was issued for the coast of the United States from Savannah, Georgia to Wilmington, North Carolina at 1600 UTC on September 28, which were quickly updated to hurricane warnings by 1900 UTC the same day. By 1900 UTC, gale warnings were in effect from Daytona Beach, Florida to Savannah, Georgia as well as from Wilmington to Morehead City, North Carolina. At 1200 UTC on September 29, gale warnings were dropped south of Brunswick, Georgia. At 2200 UTC, gale warnings were extended northward to Cape May, New Jersey, including Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. At 0400 UTC on September 30, all warnings south of Cape Hatteras were dropped, leaving gale warnings in effect from Cape Hatteras northward. At 1000 UTC, small craft were advised to remain in port from Cape May northward to Block Island, Rhode Island. By 1600 UTC, due to Gracie&#x27;s continued weakening, all remaining gale warnings were downgraded to small craft warnings.

==Impact==

===Georgia and South Carolina===

Storm surge flooding was minimal due to the storm&#x27;s landfall near the time of low tide. However, Charleston still recorded their highest tide since 1940. Along the coast of southern South Carolina, the storm tide was measured up to above mean lower low water (the average level of the lowest low tide each day). The United States Coast Guard vessel Bramble evacuated people stranded in Savannah and Charleston on September 30. Gracie killed 10 people in South Carolina and Georgia, mainly due to wind and rain-induced automobile accidents, falling trees and electrocution by live wires. The Garden Club of South Carolina replaced numerous trees after the storm. Wind damage was quite significant across South Carolina, particularly the city of Beaufort, South Carolina, with many downed trees, telephone poles, and streetlights. Also, numerous windows were shattered and shingles were torn off of roofs. A number of creeks overflowed causing floodwaters that, in areas, were several feet deep. The opening of the Beaufort Center of the University of South Carolina was delayed due to Gracie. It would be 30 years before another major hurricane struck South Carolina: Hurricane Hugo in September 1989.

===Elsewhere in the United States===
Heavy rains fell well ahead of the storm along an inverted trough extending north of the storm, causing between the mornings of September 28 and September 29 at Norfolk, Virginia. The highest rainfall amount measured during the storm was at Big Meadows. The storm spawned six tornadoes in all. This included three F3 tornadoes which accompanied the dissipating storm through Virginia, killing 12 people and injuring 13 near Charlottesville, Virginia. Three F1 tornadoes had touched down in the Carolinas prior to those touching down. For the most part, rainfall from Gracie was beneficial as it moved up the Appalachians since the area had been in a drought preceding the cyclone.

==Long-term impact==
Edisto Beach, South Carolina was changed forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most of the shell hash beach currently at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated and moved to the shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.

<doc id="986896" wikidata="Q1577502" url="?curid=986896" title="Tribal-class destroyer (1936)">
<text>The Tribal class, or &quot;Afridi&quot; class, was a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II. Originally conceived during design studies for a light fleet cruiser, the Tribals evolved into fast, powerful destroyers, with greater emphasis on guns over torpedoes than previous destroyers, in response to new designs by Japan, Italy, and Germany. The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public when they were in service due to their power, often becoming symbols of prestige while in service.

As some of the Royal Navy&#x27;s most modern and powerful escort ships, the Tribal class served with distinction in nearly all theatres of World War II. Only a handful of Royal Navy Tribals survived the war, all of which were subsequently scrapped from hard use, while Commonwealth Tribals continued to serve into the Cold War, serving with distinction in the Korean War. Only one Tribal survives to this day: , which is now a museum ship in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada.

==Design history==
From 1926, all Royal Navy destroyers had descended from a common lineage based upon the prototypes and . During the interwar period, advances in armament and machinery meant that by the mid-1930s, these &quot;interwar standard&quot; destroyers were being eclipsed by foreign designs, particularly from Japan, Italy, and Germany. To counteract this trend, the Admiralty decided on a new destroyer type, with an emphasis on gunnery over torpedo warfare. The destroyer was based on &#x27;Design V&#x27;, a design study for a small fleet cruiser (another variant of this design evolved into the ). This design envisioned a 1,850-ton ship with a speed of , an endurance of , and five twin 4.7 inch guns as main armament.
Although the design was rejected for the fleet cruiser role, by August 1935, after no less than eight design proposals, it had evolved to present a destroyer with eight 4.7 inch Quick Firing Mark XII guns, in four twin mountings, with a maximum elevation of 40°, controlled by a low-angle (LA) director and high-angle / low-angle (HA/LA) rangefinder director on the bridge. To provide close range anti-aircraft protection, the design was fitted with a quadruple Mark VII QF 2 pdr &quot;pom pom&quot; mounting, and two quadruple Vickers .50-inch machine guns. These ships introduced the Fuze Keeping Clock High Angle Fire Control Computer, which was used on all subsequent British wartime destroyers. The ships were also armed with a quadruple bank of torpedo tubes. They were considered to be handsome ships, with a clipper bow that provided excellent seakeeping and two raked funnels and masts. They are remembered with great affection to this day.

==Construction==
The Royal Navy placed an order for seven Tribals on 10 March 1936, with a second group of nine Tribals ordered on 9 June for two flotillas&#x27; worth of ships. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal Canadian Navy both ordered a flotilla of Tribals. The eight Australian ships were to be built in Australian shipyards. Three were completed, two in 1942 and one in 1945, but the rest were cancelled. The Canadian order was for four ships from British yards in 1940 (completed in 1942 and 1943) and another four from Canadian yards at Halifax in 1942. The latter were not completed until after the war.

Between 1937 and 1945, twenty-seven Tribals were built. Estimated cost per ship was around £340,000 excluding weaponry, and £520,000 overall.

==Modifications==
===Wartime modifications===
The Royal Navy equipped the Tribal class with a comparatively heavy anti-aircraft armament; all eight 4.7in guns could engage aircraft with predicted fire using the FKC computer, and thus provide a powerful augmentation to the battle-fleet&#x27;s AA defence. The close range AA armament of a quad 2pdr and two quad Vickers machine guns was a marked advance over previous destroyer classes and heavier than most other nations&#x27; close range destroyer armament in 1939. However, prewar, the Royal Navy assumed that destroyers would be acting mainly as escorts for the battle-fleet, and would not be the primary focus of aerial attack and would not require more than 40-degree elevation for the main armament. Events soon showed that destroyers often functioned independently and so became the main target of Luftwaffe attack, especially by dive bombers. After the loss of &quot;Afridi&quot; and &quot;Gurkha&quot;, the remaining ships were taken in hand to improve the situation. Each ship&#x27;s &#x27;X&#x27; turret, which held a 4.7-inch mounting, was removed and replaced by two QF Mark XVI guns on the twin HA/LA Mark XIX mounting. The mainmast was cut down and the rear funnel was lowered to improve the arcs of fire for the anti-aircraft weapons. As they became available, the more effective 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added, at first adding to and eventually replacing the .50 in./12.7 mm machine guns. Depth charge storage was also increased, from 30 to 46 charges. Furthermore, the class initially had problems with leaks in feedwater tanks; this was traced to issues with the turbine blades caused by structural stress when steaming at high speed in rough weather.

By 1944, the four surviving British Tribals were given a tall lattice foremast to carry a Type 293 radar target indication and Type 291 air warning, with Type 285 radar added to the rangefinder-director. The first two Canadian built Tribals, &quot;Micmac&quot; and &quot;Nootka&quot;, were armed with the then standard armament of three 4.7-inch twin mountings and a single twin 4-inch mount, with the 4.7-inch mounts being given improved A.A. fuze setters, while the last two Canadian-built Tribals were equipped with eight Mark XVI guns with R.P.C. and four to six Bofors 40 mm guns as standard, along with a Mk VI Director.

===Post-war modifications===
Post war, survivors of the class met different fates: Royal Navy Tribals were retired by the 1950s, while Tribals in service with the Australian and Canadian navies continued in service, with many refitted as anti-submarine destroyers. The British-built Canadian Tribals landed their 4.7-inch guns, and received a pair of 4-inch Mark XVI guns in twin mounts in the &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; positions instead, improving anti-aircraft capabilities, a pair of Squid mortars for anti-submarine warfare, and a twin 3 inch/50 Mark 33 gun on the &#x27;X&#x27; position as an anti-aircraft weapon. Sensors were also upgraded for their new roles, and as refitted, Canadian Tribals continued to serve until the 1960s.

Two of the Australian Tribals, &quot;Arunta&quot; and &quot;Warramunga&quot;, were modernised during the early 1950s. The aft-most gun mounting was removed, with the space modified to accommodate a Squid anti-submarine mortar. New sonar and radar units were fitted, the latter requiring the replacement of the tripod radar mast with a stronger lattice structure. Although the modernisation was intended to take less than six months per ship, it took two years for each ship to be refitted, by which time their modifications had already become obsolete. Financial restrictions meant that the third Australian Tribal, &quot;Bataan&quot;, was not modernised, and a combination of manpower shortages and rapid obsolescence saw all three ships decommissioned by the end of the 1950s.

==Service==
As some of the Royal Navy&#x27;s most modern and powerful escorts, they were widely deployed in World War II, and served with great distinction in nearly all theatres of war. The Tribals were often selected for special tasks and as a result, losses were heavy, with 12 of the 16 Royal Navy Tribals sunk, as well as one Canadian ship. &quot;Gurkha&quot; has the rare and unfortunate distinction of being the name of two ships that were sunk in World War II: the L-class destroyer was renamed to honour the lost Tribal-class ship, and was herself lost in 1942.

===1940===

&quot;Cossack&quot; earned fame early on in the war, when on 6 February 1940, commanded by Captain Philip Vian, she pursued and then boarded the German tanker in neutral Norwegian waters in a daring attack to rescue around 300 British prisoners of war on board. Referred to as the Altmark Incident, this was the last true naval boarding action for the Royal Navy. &quot;Gurkha&quot; was an early loss, being sunk by German bombers off Stavanger. &quot;Afridi&quot; was lost soon afterwards to dive bombers while evacuating troops from Namsos. &quot;Bedouin&quot;, &quot;Punjabi&quot;, &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Cossack&quot; took part in the Second Battle of Narvik, where &quot;Eskimo&quot; had her bow blown off.

===1941===
In May 1941, &quot;Somali&quot;, &quot;Bedouin&quot;, and &quot;Eskimo&quot;, along with the N-class destroyer , and Royal Navy cruisers , , and boarded the German weather ship &quot;München&quot;, retrieving vital Enigma cypher codebooks. In the same month, &quot;Zulu&quot;, &quot;Sikh&quot;, &quot;Cossack&quot;, &quot;Maori&quot; and Polish (N-class destroyer) were in action against the , with &quot;Mashona&quot; being sunk by German aircraft during these operations. In the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was lost as part of &quot;Force K&quot;, torpedoed by the in April, while &quot;Cossack&quot;, &quot;Sikh&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;, and &quot;Maori&quot; took part in Operation Substance, a relief convoy heading to Malta. &quot;Cossack&quot; was torpedoed by in October while escorting Convoy HG 74 in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Gibraltar, sinking later under tow. &quot;Maori&quot; and &quot;Sikh&quot; were amongst the victors at the Battle of Cape Bon in December. &quot;Bedouin&quot; took part in Operation Archery, a British combined operations raid which diverted German resources to Norway for the rest of the war.

===1942===
In 1942, &quot;Matabele&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by in the Barents Sea and &quot;Maori&quot; was hit in the engine room by a bomb whilst lying in Grand Harbour, Valletta, in February, catching fire and later blowing up where she lay. &quot;Punjabi&quot; was accidentally rammed and sunk by the battleship in May, whilst performing close escort in thick weather. In June, &quot;Bedouin&quot; was disabled in action with Regia Marina&#x27;s cruisers and during Operation Harpoon. Although later taken in tow by the tow had to be cast when the Italian cruisers reappeared and, dead in the water, &quot;Bedouin&quot; was sunk by aircraft torpedo attack. &quot;Ashanti&quot; was assigned to Operation Pedestal of August 1942. In September, the final two Tribals lost in the Battle of the Mediterranean were sunk; &quot;Sikh&quot; and &quot;Zulu&quot; during a disastrous raid on Tobruk. Also that month, &quot;Somali&quot; was torpedoed by while covering the returning Russian Convoy QP 14. Although taken under tow by , she sank four days later after heavy weather broke her back. This was the last Royal Navy Tribal lost during the war.

===1943===
In 1943, the four remaining British Tribals (&quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Tartar&quot;, and &quot;Nubian&quot;) participated in Operation Retribution to prevent the Afrika Korps from being evacuated to Italy. &quot;Tartar&quot;, &quot;Nubian&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; then covered the Allied invasion of Sicily. After the invasion of Sicily, the four then covered the Allied invasion of Italy at Salerno. &quot;Ashanti&quot; and &quot;Athabaskan&quot; then covered Arctic convoy RA 55A, which was involved in the Battle of North Cape, where the German battleship was sunk.

At the same time, the two active Australian Tribals, &quot;Arunta&quot; and &quot;Warramunga&quot;, were attached to the joint Australian-American Task Force 74 and supported a series of landings in New Britain, and deployed to support a series of landings in Operation Cartwheel.
The Canadian Tribals were also heavily engaged; &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was hit by German glide bombs while conducting operations in the Bay of Biscay and was put out of action for almost three months, while &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; escorted the various Arctic convoys.

===1944===
&quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, &quot;Haida&quot;, &quot;Huron&quot;, &quot;Nubian&quot;, &quot;Tartar&quot; and later &quot;Iroquois&quot; saw extensive action in the English Channel before and after Operation Overlord, sinking or damaging a variety of enemy ships.

In April, and engaged two s in the Channel. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was sunk by a torpedo from &quot;T24&quot;, while &quot;Haida&quot; pursued and forced aground &quot;T27&quot;. Afterward, &quot;Haida&quot; returned and managed to rescue 42 personnel from &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. One of the under-construction Canadian Tribals was then renamed &quot;Athabaskan&quot; as a tribute to the lost ship. During the Normandy invasion, &quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Tatar&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; sank, damaged, or drove ashore the Elbing-class torpedo boat &quot;T24&quot;, the s and , and the ex-Dutch destroyer &quot;Gerard Callenburgh&quot; in a series of battles. Furthermore, &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; also sank the German U-boat with depth charges and close in gunfire, rescuing 53 survivors. Afterward, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was involved in a collision with the destroyer HMS &quot;Javelin&quot;, which kept &quot;Eskimo&quot; out of action for five months.

After the Normandy invasion, &quot;Nubian&quot; was sent to screen Royal Navy Home Fleet units engaged in the protection of the Russian Convoy JW 59, and carrier-based aerial attacks on the and elsewhere in Norway. &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;Haida&quot; met up with the Free French cruiser which was sailing from Algiers to Cherbourg carrying members of the French Provisional Government. &quot;Iroquois&quot; then escorted the liner which was carrying the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Second Quebec Conference.

===1945===
&quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Nubian&quot;, and &quot;Tartar&quot; were given some minor tropicalisation refits and were sent east to join the British Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean as the Atlantic war wound down. There, &quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Nubian&quot;, and &quot;Tartar&quot; engaged in escort of the Royal Navy major surface units and shore bombardment. Afterward, &quot;Nubian&quot;, and &quot;Tartar&quot; were waiting as backup for Battle of the Malacca Strait, where the Japanese cruiser was sunk. &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; were then engaged in anti-shipping patrols, sinking a Japanese merchant ship and a submarine chaser near Sumatra. This was the last Royal Navy surface action against shipping in World War II. In July, &quot;Nubian&quot; and &quot;Tartar&quot; prepared for Operation Zipper, the planned British landings in Malaya.

During this period, the Canadian Tribals continued to be engaged; &quot;Haida&quot;, &quot;Huron&quot; and &quot;Iroquois&quot; escorted Russian convoys until May 1945, when Germany surrendered. The Canadian Tribals then engaged in the escort of British warships liberating Norway following the German surrender. &quot;Iroquois&quot; then joined the British cruisers and and destroyer at Copenhagen and headed to Wilhelmshaven, as escort for the surrendered German cruisers and . Following this, the Canadian Tribals then returned to Halifax harbour for tropicalisation refits, which were suspended when the Japanese surrendered, and were sent into reserve.

==Post-war==
Twenty-three Tribal-class destroyers were constructed before and during World War II; sixteen for the Royal Navy, four for the Royal Canadian Navy, and three for the Royal Australian Navy. Thirteen were lost during the war; six British Tribals to aircraft attack, four British and one Canadian Tribal to torpedo attacks, one British Tribal to shore batteries off Tobruk, and one British Tribal in a collision with a British battleship.
The surviving four British destroyers were paid off and sold for scrap during 1948 and 1949, while the Australian and Canadian Tribals were refitted and modernised for post-war service. Four destroyers still under construction in Canada when World War II ended were completed and then modernised, while five ships under construction in Australia were cancelled.

The Australian and Canadian ships, with the exception of &quot;Micmac&quot;, served during the Korean War, with &quot;Bataan&quot; at one point escorting a United States aircraft carrier with the same name. The Australian and Canadian Tribals continued in service until the late 1950s and early 1960s, when they were gradually decommissioned and sold for scrapping.

Only one ship of the class has been preserved. was restored and is docked in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada as a museum ship. The bow of , sunk on 12 February 1942 by German aircraft, rests below sea level in Valletta&#x27;s Marsamxett Harbour, Malta, and is a popular scuba diving site.

==In fiction==

The fictional Tribal-class destroyer &quot;Hakka&quot; is the setting for the 2001 Douglas Reeman novel &quot;For Valour.&quot;

<text>Diablo Valley College (DVC) is a public community college with campuses in Pleasant Hill and San Ramon in Contra Costa County, California. DVC is one of three public community colleges in the Contra Costa Community College District (along with Contra Costa College and Los Medanos College). It opened in 1949. DVC has more than 22,000 students and 300 full-time and 370 part-time instructors.

==History==
Diablo Valley College was founded in 1949 as East Contra Costa Junior College. The college enrolls over 22,000 students on two sites.

===Grade-fixing scandal===
In 2007, a six-year grade fixing scheme came to light with allegations that over 70 students used sex or cash as payment to student employees in the admissions and records office in exchange for over 400 grade changes. Many of these students had transferred to universities and in some cases may have already graduated. By November 2007, 49 students had been charged with misdemeanors or felonies over the incident, and at least one had accepted a no contest plea. A spokesperson for the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges said that although the scandal was a negative factor it would be unlikely to lead to the school&#x27;s loss of accreditation.

In the first trial resulting from the grade changes, former student employee Erick Martinez was acquitted of all criminal charges on September 5, 2008. Jurors reached that decision after concluding that prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a definite link between Martinez and grade changes.

==Academics==
DVC is a &quot;feeder&quot; college to the University of California, Berkeley; California State University, East Bay; and St. Mary&#x27;s College. It ranks among the top five transfer colleges in California. In 2004, the top four transfer destinations were California State University, East Bay, San Francisco State University, University of California, Berkeley and University of California, Davis.

DVC also offers a variety of occupational specialties, including hotel/restaurant management, culinary arts, dental technology and real estate. It has an active speech and debating team.

==Athletics==
DVC offers sports including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo, baseball, football, lacrosse, track and field (men) and soccer, softball, and volleyball (women).

Willie McGee played baseball for DVC in 1977, and would later win a National League MVP award in 1985. Pitcher Doug Davis also played in the majors from 1999 to 2011.

Demarshay Johnson, a former DVC basketball star who went on to play for the University of Nevada, was named California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) first team All-State after the 2004–05 season. That season he led the CCCAA in blocks, averaging 5.2 per game, and was named Bay Valley Conference MVP.

The DVC Viking men&#x27;s lacrosse program was the first junior college club in California, forming in 2008. In 2013, DVC won the California Junior College Lacrosse Association (CJCLA) championship.

==College newspaper==
&quot;The Inquirer&quot;, the college&#x27;s student-run newspaper, is produced on campus by the Journalism 126 class.

The newspaper was forced to produce its paper off-site at the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; newsroom when a bomb-threat on October 24, 2006, closed the campus and access to the newsroom was restricted.

The Inquirer won General Excellence awards from the Journalism Association of Community Colleges (JACC) in 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The newspaper also won a Pacesetter award from JACC in 1999.

==Sponsors==
The student union at DVC is named for Margaret Lesher, widow of Dean Lesher, founder of the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; and cofounder of the Margaret and Dean Lesher Foundation.

==Notable alumni==

<text>Claire L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé (born September 7, 1927) is a retired Canadian judge who served as a puisne justice on the Supreme Court of Canada from 1987 to 2002. She was the first woman from Quebec and the second woman appointed to this position, after Bertha Wilson. Previously, she had been one of the first woman lawyers to handle divorce cases, and was the first woman appointed as a judge to the Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

During L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s time on the country&#x27;s top court, she earned a reputation as a steadfast feminist and supporter of minority rights. Because roughly 40 percent of the 254 judgements that she wrote were dissents, she became known as the court&#x27;s &quot;great dissenter&quot;.

== Early life and career ==

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was born Claire L&#x27;Heureux in Quebec City in 1927. She was one of four girls raised by a mother who spent fifty years as a quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis which developed when L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was only nine. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé attended the Ursuline Monastery of Quebec City and worked at a cod liver oil plant in Rimouski, Quebec, but quit when she was nineteen to continue her education.

In 1951, she graduated cum laude from the law faculty of Université Laval, despite facing gender discrimination such as not being given scholarships that were awarded to men of similar financial means. She then entered private practice in Quebec. From 1952 until 1973, she worked at L&#x27;Heureux, Philippon, Garneau, Tourigny, St-Arnaud &amp; Associates, and was one of the first woman lawyers to work with divorce cases in the province.

In February 1973, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was appointed as a judge onto the Quebec Superior Court, becoming its first woman judge. From 1973 to 1976, she led a federal commission studying immigration problems in the province of Quebec. In October 1979, she was elevated to the Quebec Court of Appeal and was its first female judge. In 1981, she, along with future colleague Rosalie Abella, published &quot;Family Law: Dimensions of Justice,&quot; about Canadian family law. After eight years and writing 1,200 judgements for the Quebec Court of Appeal, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was elevated to the Supreme Court of Canada by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in April 1987.

== Supreme Court ==

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s elevation to the Supreme Court in 1987 made her the second woman to sit on the country&#x27;s highest court, after Bertha Wilson. According to L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé, a fellow judge on the Supreme Court refused to speak to her for the first three months after her appointment before passing her a note saying he considered her to have passed her probationary period.

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé is typically remembered as one of the most prolific dissenters of the Court. Her judicial view was atypical for her time and often clashed with the majority of the Court. Her writing style and her tendency to use social science research in her reasons made for opinions that were often notable for their sheer length.

Among her more controversial decisions include her reasons in &quot;Moge v Moge&quot;, where she took a major departure from the practised standard of judicial notice by allowing for a broad range of social studies data to be given judicial notice as a legislative fact. Another famous dissent was in &quot;Canada (AG) v Mossop&quot;, where she alone acknowledged that the meaning of &quot;family&quot; is not fixed and should be read purposively to adapt to the changing times and it should include same-sex couples.

In a style reminiscent of Lord Denning MR, in the case of &quot;Willick v Willick&quot;, she quoted a &quot;dictum&quot; she made in an earlier judgment, with which she &quot;most heartily&quot; agreed.

In the 1994 case &quot;Dagenais v Canadian Broadcasting Corp&quot;, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé disagreed with the majority opinion written by Chief Justice Lamer that there was no hierarchy of rights in Canada because Charter rights – freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial in this case – had to be balanced against each other. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé dissented, saying that in addition to CBC lacking a valid right to appeal to the Supreme Court, when freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial cannot be simultaneously fully respected, the latter should temporarily prevail.

In 1998, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was named president of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists.

In 1999, her concurring decision in &quot;R v Ewanchuk&quot; became the focus of a very public debate with Justice McClung of Alberta Court of Appeal. Justice McClung had written the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal, upholding the acquittal of an accused person in a sexual assault case. The Supreme Court overturned the acquittal and directed a re-trial. In her concurring opinion, written on behalf of herself and Justice Gonthier, Justice L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé described his ruling as showing outdated and stereotypical thinking about sexual assault. In response, Justice McClung wrote a letter to the &quot;National Post&quot; attacking L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé, describing her writing as overly personal and blaming her attitude for the rise in the suicide rate of Quebec men. The letter was controversial, and drew even more furor when it was pointed out that L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s husband had committed suicide in 1978. A few months after the debate, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé heard McClung had fallen ill, and wrote him a supportive letter, for which he thanked her and which she considered to be the end of the debate.

Later in 1999, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé wrote the majority decision in &quot;Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)&quot;, holding that international law, even when its provisions were unincorporated into Canadian law, could still be a source from which judges could find the values and principles behind Canadian legislation. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé followed the decision in &quot;Baker&quot; with her majority decision in the 2001 case of &quot;Hudson v Spraytech &amp; ChemLawn&quot;, holding that the precautionary principle should be seen as part of international customary law. She then ruled that the municipal government of Hudson, Quebec, was justified in banning Spraytech&#x27;s pesticides and was not acting &quot;ultra vires&quot; the &quot;general welfare&quot; powers delegated to it by the Quebec provincial government.

At the time of her retirement on July 1, 2002, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was the most senior judge on the court in terms of time served. During her tenure on the court, she was regarded as perhaps its most controversial member, and as someone who usually only slept four hours a day so she could focus on her work. Critics labelled her a feminist, equal-rights ideologue because of her support for the battered woman defense, tax deductions for mothers in the workforce, expansive provisions for spousal support, and the protection of sexual-assault complainants&#x27; privacy. During her time on the court, she was a proponent of equality rights of women, immigrants, LGBT people, and other minority groups. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé heard more than 1200 Supreme Court cases, wrote 254 judgments, dissenting from the majority in about 40 percent of them, which earned her the label of the &quot;great dissenter&quot;.

== Post-Supreme Court activities ==

Shortly after L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s July 2002 retirement from the Supreme Court at the age of 74, she took a Judge in Residence position with Université Laval University in Quebec City.

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé also served as the president of La Maison de justice de Québec, a pilot project to improve access to justice in Quebec City which operated from 2004 until its 2006 closure after it failed to become financially self-sufficient. It sought to serve people who made too much to qualify for legal aid, but not enough to afford a lawyer by offering free services provided by mostly retired legal professionals. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé had been chosen to run the pilot project&#x27;s administrative aspects and recruitment effort because of her devotion to social justice and her legal connections.

In a 2013 report for the National Assembly of Quebec, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé led a committee that recommended that Members of the National Assembly should give up benefits such as a golden parachute severance package in exchange for a pay raise from $88,000 to $136,000. The report proposed that this exchange of benefits for a payroll increase would be &quot;cost neutral&quot;. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s report also proposed that transparency in expenditures be increased by forcing all members of the assembly to disclose their benefits, allowances, and indemnities to the public. As of December 2015, the pay raise was still not implemented, though the transition bonus given to MNAs who leave their office mid-term for any reason had been removed.

In February 2014, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé spoke in support of the proposed Quebec Charter of Values during public hearings in the National Assembly. She argued that it did not infringe on human rights and was an opportunity to make Quebec a secular society. She also believed that it would withstand a constitutional challenge, saying that women&#x27;s right to equality trumped the right to wear religious clothing, which was not the same right as freedom of religion. She had earlier indicated in a 2013 Radio Canada interview that fundamental rights such as the right to life and equality should not be abrogated by other civil liberties which could be &quot;reduced&quot; in a &quot;free and democratic society&quot;. In response to email questions from &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé also cited the thesis in Israeli judge and legal theorist Aharon Barak&#x27;s book &quot;Proportionality&quot; that rights have to be given importance based on society&#x27;s values.

== Personal life and honours ==

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé married Arthur Dubé in 1957 and gave birth to a son and a daughter. Her husband died of suicide in 1978. Her son died in 1994; her daughter became a lawyer. L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé considered her judicial work as a refuge for the pain in her personal life by allowing her to compartmentalize her life.

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel by the Province of Quebec in 1969. She was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003. In 2004, she was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec, in recognition of her legal career and her contributions to equality for marginalized communities in both Quebec and Canada.

<text>The 96th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 1979, to January 3, 1981, during the last two years of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1970 census.

Both chambers retained a Democratic majority (though downgraded from the supermajority status in the previous Congress), and with President Carter, maintained an overall federal government trifecta. This is the last Congress in which the Democrats retained a trifecta for more than one term.

This is the most recent Congress to feature a Democratic senator from Idaho, Frank Church, who lost re-election in 1980.
