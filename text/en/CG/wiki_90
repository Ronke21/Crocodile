<text>Cölln () was the twin city of Old Berlin (Alt-Berlin) from the 13th century to the 18th century. Cölln was located on the Fisher Island section of Spree Island, opposite Altberlin on the western bank of the River Spree, until the cities were merged by Frederick I of Prussia to form Berlin in 1710. Today, the former site of Cölln is the historic core of the modern Mitte locality of the Berlin-Mitte borough in central Berlin.

==History==
Cölln is first mentioned in a 1237 deed, denoting a priest Symeon of Cölln&#x27;s (Symeon de Colonia) Saint Peter&#x27;s Church as a witness. This date is commonly regarded as the origin of Berlin, though Altberlin on the eastern bank of the Spree river was not mentioned before 1244 and parts of modern Greater Berlin, such as Spandau and Köpenick, are even older.

Cölln and Altberlin were separated only by the river Spree, linked by the &quot;Mühlendamm&quot; causeway, hence there was a close connection right from the start. Since the trade route from Magdeburg to Frankfurt (Oder) crosses the twin town and the inland water-transportation routes also passed through it, Cölln-Berlin quickly came to prosperity. A second crossing, the &quot;Lange Brücke&quot; (Long Bridge), today the &quot;Rathausbrücke&quot; (Town Hall Bridge) was erected across the Spree in 1307 with a common town hall in the middle of it.

The common policy of Berlin and Cölln led 1307 to a first alliance with other towns (Brandenburg an der Havel, Frankfurt (Oder) and Salzwedel) in the March to defend their rights against the sovereign. The Elector Frederick II Irontooth of Brandenburg ended the autonomy of Cölln/Berlin and declared the twin town to his residence in 1451. In 1710 the twin cities Cölln and old Berlin merged by the order of King Frederick I to form the capital of Prussia. As Altberlin was twice as big as Cölln at that time, the merged city was named Berlin.

The name of Cölln survives in Berlin&#x27;s southeastern quarter Neukölln (&quot;New Cölln&quot;), formerly Rixdorf, and the homonymous borough of Neukölln, which are geographically distinct from the historical Neu-Cölln, a southern extension of Cölln, originally also called &quot;Neu-Cölln am Wasser&quot; (Neu-Cölln by the water). As Neu-Kölln, it later became a small district of Berlin until the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. The Köllnischer Park and the street &quot;Am Köllnischen Park&quot; are both located in the former territory of Neu-Cölln. The &quot;Bärenzwinger&quot; enclosure situated in the park was until 2015 home to three brown bears—the bear is the heraldic animal of the city of Berlin— representing the cradle of the city.

==Places of interest==

Cölln&#x27;s centre the Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, originally built about 1230 and reconstructed several times over the centuries, had been badly damaged by air raids and the Battle of Berlin in 1945. It was finally demolished in 1964. The church bore its name because many of Cölln&#x27;s inhabitants depended on fishing. Today only the name of the &quot;Petriplatz&quot; square marks the site. From here the &quot;Brüderstraße&quot; runs north, named after the brothers of a former Dominican monastery established in 1297. Though most of the neighbourhood was destroyed, a few Baroque houses remained:

The bookseller Christoph Friedrich Nicolai lived on &quot;Brüderstraße 13&quot; from 1787 until his death in 1811. Today the house is still called &quot;Nicolaihaus&quot;, it was erected about 1670 and had belonged to the merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky from 1747 to 1773. Nicolai had it remodeled by the mason and composer Carl Friedrich Zelter, making it a meeting-point of intellectuals influenced by the Age of Enlightenment (&quot;Aufklärung&quot;) and Romanticism movement. In 1786 Honoré Mirabeau stayed here on his first trip to Berlin and so did the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow, the printmaker Daniel Chodowiecki as well as the poet Theodor Körner in 1811. Körner&#x27;s father Christian Gottfried Körner lived here as a Prussian Privy councillor from 1815 to 1828.

On &quot;Brüderstraße 10&quot; stands the &quot;Galgenhaus&quot; (Gallows House), built about 1688. According to legend, a maidservant was hanged right in front of the house in 1735, being falsely accused of stealing a silver spoon. From 1742 on the building belonged to the early statistician Johann Peter Süßmilch, at this time provost of the Saint Peter&#x27;s Church. The neighbouring building, built in 1905, is home of the Berlin representation of the Federal State of Saxony.

Nearby the &quot;Sperlingsgasse&quot; branches off, where the novelist Wilhelm Raabe lived from 1854 to 1856 and published his popular work &quot;Die Chronik der Sperlingsgasse&quot;. The small alley, at this time the &quot;Spreegasse&quot;, was renamed in 1931 on occasion of the author&#x27;s hundredth anniversary. All former buildings on this street were demolished about 1960.

The northern part of the &quot;Brüderstraße&quot; today is covered by the 1964 building of the former Staatsrat of the German Democratic Republic. The façade at the &quot;Schloßplatz&quot; square includes the preserved portal No. IV of the Hohenzollern City Palace, where Karl Liebknecht on 9 November 1918 declared a free socialist republic of Germany. After German reunification the building served as the Chancellery from 1999 to 2001. Today it houses the European School of Management and Technology and the Hertie School of Governance. The area north of the &quot;Schloßplatz&quot; is the site of the historic City Palace. In accordance with a 2002 resolution by the federal Bundestag parliament, the City Palace was rebuilt.

Parallel to the &quot;Brüderstraße&quot; runs the &quot;Breite Straße&quot; (Broad Street), Cölln&#x27;s main street. At the corner of the &quot;Schloßplatz&quot; are the buildings of the Old and the New &quot;Marstall&quot; riding stables of the Electors of Brandenburg, built in 1670 and 1901. Today the New &quot;Marstall&quot; is a seat of the Hanns Eisler Conservatory. On neighbouring &quot;Breite Straße 35&quot; is the late Renaissance &quot;Ribbeckhaus&quot; from 1624, one of Berlin&#x27;s oldest preserved residential buildings, which since 1920 houses the Central and Regional Library.

Three historic bridges connect Cölln with the 17th century extension of Friedrichswerder on the western bank of the Spree river: the &quot;Schleusenbrücke&quot; (Sluice Bridge) at the &quot;Schloßplatz&quot;, a steel construction erected in 1916, the &quot;Gertraudenbrücke&quot; with the statue of Saint Gertrude of Nivelles by the sculptor Rudolf Siemering from 1896 and the small &quot;Jungfernbrücke&quot; (Virgin&#x27;s Bridge) built in 1798, Berlin&#x27;s oldest and the only bascule bridge of the city.

<text>A voiturette is a miniature automobile.

==History==
&quot;Voiturette&quot; was first registered by Léon Bollée in 1895 to name his new motor tricycle. The term became so popular in the early years of the motor industry that it was used by many makers to describe their small cars. The word comes from the French word for &quot;automobile&quot;, &quot;voiture&quot;.
Between World War I and World War II light-weight racing cars with engines limited to 1500 cc such as the Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta, the Bugatti Type 13 and the original ERAs were known as voiturettes.

In France, in the years after World War II a type of small three-wheeled vehicle voiturette was produced.

In 1990s, voiturette became a French classification for a vehicle weighing less than 350 kilograms (770 lb) empty and carrying a load (i.e. passengers) of not more than 200 kilograms (~440 lb). The top speed is limited to 46 km/h (~30 mph) and engine size to 50 cc or 4 kilowatts for an engine of &quot;another type&quot; for example an electric car.
 Such vehicles are sometimes also called &quot;motor quadricycles&quot; or &quot;motor tricycles&quot;. The driver&#x27;s license for them is available to people over 16 years and is in category &quot;B1&quot; and is valid, subject to restrictions, in all European Union countries.

==Renault&#x27;s 1898 Voiturette==

French maker Renault&#x27;s first car was simply called Voiturette, instead of the common usage then (it would have been called Renault 1¾ CV). The 1900 model (Voiturette C) was considered the first ever sedan (a car with roof).

<doc id="1002821" wikidata="Q7270129" url="?curid=1002821" title="Queen's Truncheon">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Truncheon is a ceremonial staff carried by the Royal Gurkha Rifles that serves as the equivalent of and is carried as the Colour. It is made of bronze and silver. The top represents the minaret of Delhi Palace with three Gurkhas standing on it supporting the Queen&#x27;s crown above their heads. The minaret contains a pair of crossed kukris and carries the inscription &quot;Main Picqet Hindoo Rao&#x27;s House, Delhi 1857&quot;. The Truncheon is a unique emblem upon which recruits swear allegiance to the Regiment and the Crown.

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the 8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion made a particularly notable contribution. During the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended Hindu Rao&#x27;s house, losing 327 out of 490 men. During this action they fought side-by-side with the 60th Rifles and a strong bond developed.

After the rebellion the 60th Rifles pressed for the Sirmoor Battalion to become a rifle regiment. This honour was granted then next year (1858) when the battalion was renamed the Sirmoor Rifle Regiment and awarded a third colour. In 1863 Queen Victoria presented the regiment with the Queen&#x27;s Truncheon, devised by Charles Reid, as a replacement for the colours that rifle regiments do not usually have.

The Sirmoor Rifle Regiment eventually became the [[2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]], retaining possession of the Truncheon until 1994, when it was amalgamated with the other three British Gurkha regiments as The Royal Gurkha Rifles. The new regiment took possession of the Truncheon on permanent loan from the 2nd Gurkhas, and maintains the tradition of using it in place of colours.

<text>Silvanus Phillips Thompson (19 June 1851 – 12 June 1916) was an English professor of physics at the City and Guilds Technical College in Finsbury, England. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891 and was known for his work as an electrical engineer and as an author. Thompson&#x27;s most enduring publication is his 1910 text &quot;Calculus Made Easy&quot;, which teaches the fundamentals of infinitesimal calculus, and is still in print. Thompson also wrote a popular physics text, &quot;Elementary Lessons in Electricity and Magnetism,&quot; as well as biographies of Lord Kelvin and Michael Faraday.

==Biography==
Thompson was born on 19 June 1851 to a Quaker family in York, England. His father served as a master at the Quaker Bootham School in York and he also studied there. In 1873 Silvanus Thompson was made the science master at the school. He graduated and sat for Bachelor of Arts University of London external degree in 1869. After a teaching apprenticeship he was awarded a scholarship to the Royal School of Mines (RSM) in South Kensington, where he studied chemistry and physics. He graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science degree and started working at RSM. He soon became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Physical Society; he participated in meetings—lectures with demonstrations of experiments organized at the Royal Institution.

On 11 February 1876 he heard Sir William Crookes give an evening discourse at the Royal Institution on &quot;The Mechanical Action of Light&quot; when Crookes demonstrated his light mill or radiometer. Thompson was intrigued and stimulated and developed a major interest in light and optics (his other main interest being electromagnetism). In 1876 he was appointed as a lecturer in physics at University College, Bristol, and later was made Professor in 1878 at the age of 27. He had received a D.Sc. from the University of London in 1878.

A major concern of Thompson was the area of technical education and he made a series of continental tours to France, Germany and Switzerland to compare the continental approach to that in the UK. In 1879 he gave a paper at the Royal Society of Arts on &quot;Apprenticeship, Scientific and Unscientific&quot; in which he detailed the deficiencies in technical education in England. In the discussion, the opinion was expressed that England was too conservative to make use of trade schools and that continental methods would not be applicable in the UK. Thompson recognised that technical education was the means by which scientific knowledge could be put into action and spent the rest of his life putting his vision into practical realisation.

In 1878 the City and Guilds of London Institute for the Advancement of Technical Education was founded. Finsbury Technical College was a teaching institution created by the City and Guilds Institute and it was as its Principal and Professor of Physics that Thompson was to devote the next 30 years.

Thompson&#x27;s particular gift was in his ability to communicate difficult scientific concepts in a clear and interesting manner. He attended and lectured at the Royal Institution giving the Christmas lectures in 1896 on &quot;Light, Visible and Invisible&quot; with an account of Röntgen Light. He was an impressive lecturer and the radiologist AE Barclay said that: &quot;None who heard him could forget the vividness of the word-pictures he placed before them&quot;.

In 1891 Thompson developed the idea of a telegraph submarine cable that could increase the distance of the electrical pulse and therefore increase the speed of transmitting words across the telegraph cable. Until then there was an average speed of between 10 and 50 words per minute but his design was to counteract the discharging of electrical energy across the cable by introducing a return earth as part of the internal electrical structure of the cable (something like coaxial cable today). His idea, written about by Charles Bright in his book &quot;Submarine Telegraphs&quot;, discusses the idea that the two wires could be designed as separate conductors but along their path they would be connected by an induction coil. This would allow for the introduction of capacitance and therefore allow for the distance of the electrical charge to increase so increasing the word count. This was a design that would help revolutionise submarine telegraphy and the future of telephone submarine systems.

Thompson repeated Röntgen&#x27;s experiments on the day after the discovery was announced in the UK and following this gave the first public demonstration of the new rays at the Clinical Society of London on 30 March 1896. William Hale-White said: &quot;The audience was thrilled, most seeing for the first time actual pieces of bones and metal. Silvanus Thompson was a prince among lecturers. I have never heard a better demonstration or attended a more memorable medical meeting&quot;.

He was the first President of the Röntgen Society (later to become the British Institute of Radiology). He described the society as being between medicine, physics and photography. It was his genius that put its stamp on that society and has made it into the rich amalgam of medical, scientific and technical members that it is today. As he said in his presidential address to the Röntgen Society: &quot;The pioneers have opened the way into the wilderness; they are now being followed by those who will occupy the new territory, complete its survey, and map out its features. Not until every corner is explored and charted will the work of our Society be ended&quot;.

In 1900 Thompson was involved in the controversial Whitehall attack on Marconi&#x27;s patents, when the Post Office commissioned both him and Professor Oliver Lodge to produce secret reports. The purpose was either to declare the Marconi Company patents invalid, or to produce similar, but technically different equipment: the latter involved Thompson. When the Admiralty received the two reports it was the pioneer of wireless telegraphy Captain (later, Admiral Sir) Henry Jackson, then commanding HMS Vulcan, whose opinion led a senior naval officer to report, &quot;it would be unworthy to try to evade the Marconi Company&#x27;s patent.&quot;

Thompson was committed to truth in all aspects and his 1915 Swarthmore Lecture delivered to the Society of Friends was &quot;The Quest for Truth&quot;, indicating his belief in truth and integrity in all aspects of our lives. Thompson remained an active member of the Religious Society of Friends, throughout his life

He died in London, after a short illness, on 12 June 1916, leaving a widow and four daughters.

==Literary works==

Thompson wrote many books of a technical nature particularly &quot;Elementary Lessons in Electricity &amp; Magnetism&quot; (1881), &quot;Dynamo-electric Machinery&quot; (1884) and the classic &quot;Calculus Made Easy&quot; which was first published in 1910, and is still in print.

Thompson had many interests including painting, literature, the history of science, and working in his greenhouse. He wrote biographies of Michael Faraday and Lord Kelvin. He also wrote about William Gilbert, the Elizabethan physician, and produced an edition of Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;De Magnete&quot; at the Chiswick Press in 1900. In 1912, Thompson published the first English translation of &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; by Christiaan Huygens.

His scientific library of historical and working books is preserved at the Institution of Electrical Engineers and is a wonderful collection (he was President of the IEE). It includes many classic books on electricity, magnetism and optics. The collection consists of 900 rare books and 2500 nineteenth and early twentieth century titles, with approximately 200 autograph letters.

<doc id="1002871" wikidata="Q3569688" url="?curid=1002871" title="Curtis Sliwa">
<text>Curtis Sliwa (; born March 26, 1954) is an American activist, radio talk show host, and founder and chief executive officer of the Guardian Angels, a nonprofit crime prevention organization. Sliwa was the Republican nominee for the 2021 New York City mayoral election, which he lost to Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams. He is currently a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2025 New York City mayoral election.

==Early life==
Curtis Sliwa was born on March 26, 1954, into a Catholic family of Polish and Italian descent, in Canarsie, Brooklyn. He has two sisters. He attended Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit high school from which he was later expelled. He graduated from Canarsie High School. In his youth, he worked as a delivery boy for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, where he was awarded the title of &quot;Newsboy of the Year&quot; and a trip to the White House after he saved several people from a burning building while on a paper route.

Prior to founding the Guardian Angels, he was night manager of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant on Fordham Road in the Bronx.

==Guardian Angels==

In May 1977, Sliwa created the &quot;Magnificent 13&quot;, a civilian group dedicated to combating violence and crime on the New York City Subway. At the time, the city was experiencing a crime wave. The Magnificent 13 grew and was renamed the Guardian Angels in 1979. The group&#x27;s actions drew strong reactions, both positive and negative. 

Most of the Guardian Angels members were either Black or Hispanic. Unarmed, the group required members to train in karate and learn the legal requirements for citizens&#x27; arrest for all members before they were to be deployed. Sliwa&#x27;s red beret is a component of the Guardian Angels&#x27; uniform.

In 1981, then-Mayor Ed Koch, a critic of Sliwa and the organization, launched an investigation into the Guardian Angels, which, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, proved &quot;so positive that the Guardian Angels will soon be awarded some sort of official status.&quot; Then-Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo was a rare early advocate of the organization, being quoted saying &quot;[t]hey are a better expression of morality than our city deserves&quot;.

In 1992, Sliwa admitted that he and the Guardian Angels faked heroic subway rescues for publicity. He also admitted to having claimed falsely that three off-duty transit police officers had kidnapped him.

In the early 1980s, he expanded operations to Buffalo and was often critical of local police policies and practices. One incident involved Guardian Angels member Frank Melvin, who was fatally shot by a Newark police officer in December 1981 after an officer claimed they mistook his unzipping of his jacket – to display his Guardian Angels emblem – as a threat. Sliwa claimed that the killing of Melvin – an African American – was racially motivated, and had been done by a White officer who was being protected by the police department, rather than by the Hispanic officer identified as the shooter. An Essex County grand jury cleared both officers of charges related to Melvin&#x27;s death.

==Murder attempt==
On June 19, 1992, Sliwa was kidnapped and shot by two gunmen after entering a stolen taxi in Manhattan. The taxi picked up Sliwa near his home in the East Village, and a gunman hiding in the front passenger seat jumped up and fired several shots, hitting him in the groin and legs. The kidnapping was foiled when Sliwa leaped from the front window of the moving cab and escaped. Sliwa underwent surgery for internal injuries and leg wounds.
Federal prosecutors eventually charged John A. Gotti, the son of Gambino crime family leader John Gotti, with attempted murder and a raft of other charges. Prosecutors claimed that Gotti was angered by remarks Sliwa had made about Gotti&#x27;s father on his radio program. After three attempts to try him, on September 20, 2005, three separate juries could not agree to convict Gotti on any of the charges brought against him, and the charges were dropped. Jurors later told reporters they believed he had a role in Sliwa&#x27;s shooting. Prosecutors declined to re-try Gotti and dismissed the charges against him. Sliwa said he would seek damages in civil court.

Michael Yannotti, a Gotti associate, was also charged with shooting Sliwa in the incident but was acquitted. 

==Media career==
===Radio===
Sliwa has been a radio broadcaster for three decades, most of that time on WABC-AM, where he began his career in 1990. In 1994, the then city-owned and operated WNYC hired Sliwa, whom WABC had released. Some, including Sliwa, have suggested that he was given access to the station by newly elected Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whom he had supported in the 1993 mayoral race.

Sliwa has become a conservative radio talk show host. Since 1996, he has hosted various radio programs on WABC, and in 2000, he became the co-host, with an attorney Ron Kuby, of the long-running &quot;Curtis and Kuby in the Morning&quot;. The show lasted eight years before Citadel Broadcasting replaced the team with Don Imus. His longtime broadcast partner was lawyer Ron Kuby, with whom he had multiple times hosted in the past &quot;Curtis &amp; Kuby&quot; weekday radio show at noon, on WABC-AM in New York City. Starting in June 2017, Sliwa&#x27;s co-host was attorney and television commentator, Eboni Williams. His most recent co-host was Juliet Huddy, who joined the show in February 2019.

The &quot;Curtis Sliwa LIVE&quot; program began national syndication on December 1, 2008. WABC retained Sliwa until November 2009, when his show was cancelled after a contract dispute. He hosted both the morning and evening &quot;drive time&quot; shows on WNYM-AM 970, but as of January 2, 2014, Sliwa returned to WABC, replacing Rush Limbaugh who moved to WOR-AM. After officially declaring his candidacy in March 2021, Sliwa&#x27;s radio program went on hiatus. His programs once again went on hiatus upon the announcement of his second candidacy in February 2025.

==Politics==
In September 2016, Sliwa and Frank Morano launched a successful hostile takeover of the Reform Party of New York State. The Party lost its ballot access in the November 2018 elections.

In December 2019, Sliwa declared in an interview that he hated then-President of the United States Donald Trump, calling him a &quot;screwball and a crackpot&quot;. In February 2021, weeks after Trump left office, Sliwa switched from the Reform Party to the Republican Party. 

Sliwa changed parties and lost control over the Reform Party after losing the required votes to keep the Reform Party on the ballot. Bill C. Merrell regained control over the NYS Reform Party and is now again NYS Chair of the Reform Party. The official state Party is again affiliated with the National Reform Party.

===2021 mayoral campaign===

Sliwa announced on March 8, 2020, that he would be running for mayor of New York City in 2021 as a Republican, seeking to become the 110th mayor of New York City.

The primary race turned Sliwa and Fernando Mateo, once friends, into bitter rivals. The Manhattan, Queens, and Bronx Republican parties endorsed Mateo while the Staten Island and Brooklyn Republican parties endorsed Sliwa. Sliwa criticized Mateo for donating to the 2017 re-election campaign of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and also accused Mateo of breaking the law; Mateo replied that Sliwa&#x27;s accusations were bogus and shameful.

During the campaign, Mateo and Sliwa clashed over loyalty to former president Donald Trump. Mateo voiced support for Trump&#x27;s claim that he won the 2020 presidential election; by contrast, Sliwa did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020 and does not support Trump&#x27;s election denial. The unofficial results showed Sliwa winning by 72 to 28 percent.

Sliwa ran on a platform opposing the defund the police movement, supporting a property tax overhaul so that working-class residents would not pay higher property taxes than wealthy citizens, keeping in place the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test while increasing opportunities for vocational training in charter schools, and focusing on fiscal restraint. He also opposed the killing of unwanted animals and supported making all animal shelters no-kill shelters, pointing to his own home life with 16 cats.

Sliwa campaigned on beginning a trial program, if elected, to test out the feasibility of universal basic income in New York City.

Sliwa lost to Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams in a landslide defeat in the general election on November 2, 2021, with Adams winning just over two-thirds of the votes. Sliwa conceded that same night, calling for unity in order to save New York City.

After his loss, he brought two cats outside the Brooklyn home of Adams in January 2023, after the latter had been fined for rodent violations, and suggested that feral cats could address the rodent problem in the city.

===Anti-illegal immigration rallies===
In late August 2023, Sliwa, along with four other organizers, were arrested after an anti-illegal immigration rally outside Gracie Mansion. Police issued a desk appearance ticket on misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest and obstruction, but the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office declined to prosecute. Sliwa had previously been arrested at several previous rallies.

===2025 mayoral campaign===

Sliwa is currently once again running for Mayor of New York City in the 2025 mayoral race, once again as a Republican. Sliwa announced his candidacy on February 13, 2025.
His platform consists of addressing the housing shortage in the city by repealing current mayor Eric Adams&#x27; &quot;City of Yes&quot; proposals, restoring zoning control to &quot;local residents, community boards, and City Council members&quot;, and overall revising the city&#x27;s zoning laws to, according to his campaign, &quot;prioritize affordability and community stability&quot;. He also plans on addressing concerns with crime in the city by hiring 7,000 more police officers, pushing for the repeal of former Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s bail reforms, which the campaign says has lead to violent offenders being released from custody and then committing more crimes, and improving conditions in New York City homeless shelters, particularly for those with mental health issues. His platform primarily focuses on crime in the New York City subways, with some of his proposals including combatting fare evasion, prioritizing prosecution of those accused of crimes against women and minorities in the subways, improving the assistance booths located in subway stations, and creating and deploying a task force of certified social workers to assist the mentally ill that live in the subway tunnels. Sliwa also pledges to improve economic conditions in the city by investing in and rebuilding where needed boroughs outside of Manhattan.
==Personal life==
Sliwa has been married four times. He wed his second wife, Lisa Evers, in 1981. At the time, she was National Director of the Guardian Angels and co-hosted a WABC-AM radio show called &quot;Angels in the Morning&quot;. She is also a martial arts expert who briefly trained with the World Wrestling Federation in 1986.

In 2000, Sliwa married his third wife, Mary (nee Galda), a former WABC employee who also served as the Guardian Angels&#x27; national director. They have one son, Anthony, born circa 2004. In 2019, Mary became Mary Paterson, after marrying former New York State governor David Paterson, who in turn is the step-father of Sliwa&#x27;s son Anthony.

Curtis Sliwa was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010, which he announced publicly on April20, 2011.

Sliwa was in a relationship with Melinda Katz, the Queens County District Attorney, and separated from her in 2014; they have two children together, conceived in vitro over the previous five years. In court documents, Sliwa&#x27;s ex-wife, Mary, accused him of diverting money to Katz while still married to Mary, as part of a plan to build a &quot;nest egg&quot; with Katz prior to moving in with her.

On July5, 2018, Sliwa wed his longtime girlfriend, animal activist and attorney Nancy Regula, at the Howe Caverns.

<text>Chiswick Records was a British independent record label. Established in 1975, Chiswick was the &quot;first true &#x27;indie&#x27; label to be established in Britain for nearly a decade&quot;. The label has been described as &quot;significant&quot; in the &quot;punk era&quot;. It released some of the earliest records recorded by The Hammersmith Gorillas, The Count Bishops, Motörhead, Joe Strummer’s The 101ers, The Damned, Skrewdriver, Billy Bragg, Kirsty MacColl, and Shane MacGowan.

==History==
The label was started by Ted Carroll and Roger Armstrong in 1975 as a subsidiary of Rock On Records. Shortly after Trevor Churchill joined, it was incorporated into Swift Records Ltd. Two years later it entered into a licensing deal with EMI. Subsidiary Ace Records was started in 1978, and Chiswick Records closed in 1983; its back catalogue is still owned by Ace Records Ltd.

The label released a number of sampler compilation albums showcasing their bands. These included &quot;Submarine Tracks &amp; Fool&#x27;s Gold (Chiswick Chartbusters Volume One)&quot; (1977) and &quot;Long Shots, Dead Certs And Odds On Favourites (Chiswick Chartbusters Volume Two)&quot; (1978).

<doc id="1002877" wikidata="Q7926888" url="?curid=1002877" title="Victoria Muñoz Mendoza">
<text>Victoria &quot;Melo&quot; Muñoz Mendoza (born December 24, 1940) is a former politician from Puerto Rico. She is the daughter of the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, founder of the Popular Democratic Party and his second wife, Inés Mendoza. Muñoz Mendoza was the first woman in Puerto Rican history to seek the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.

==Education==
Muñoz attended University High School in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. She went to the University of Puerto Rico, where she received a degree in Literature in 1962.

==Political career==

Muñoz Mendoza first went into active in politics in 1984, when she made an unsuccessful bid to become Mayor of San Juan. In 1986, she was chosen to replace a senator in the Senate of Puerto Rico. She held the seat for seven years, after having been re-elected in 1988.

In 1992, she became the first woman to seek the governorship of Puerto Rico. She faced Pedro Rosselló of the New Progressive Party and ended up losing. She retired from politics soon after her electoral defeat.

In 2000, Sila María Calderón was elected Governor of Puerto Rico, becoming the first woman to do so. Muñoz Mendoza vigorously campaigned and endorsed her, fulfilling her dream of having a female Governor.

<doc id="1002895" wikidata="Q5290963" url="?curid=1002895" title="Dominik Diamond">
<text>Dominik Paul Diamond (born 31 December 1969) is a Scottish television, radio presenter and newspaper columnist. He is best known as the original presenter of Channel 4&#x27;s video gaming programme &quot;GamesMaster&quot;, as host of &quot;The Dominik Diamond Breakfast Show&quot; on XFM Scotland and as a columnist for the &quot;Daily Star&quot;. After moving to Canada in 2009, he has hosted radio shows for stations in Toronto, Halifax and Calgary, where he was host of the Morning Show on Jack FM from 2015 to 2018.

==Early life==
Born in Arbroath, Scotland, Diamond attended Strathallan School in Forgandenny, Perthshire.

He then went on to study drama at Bristol University, where he was a contemporary of David Walliams and Simon Pegg. Diamond, Walliams and Pegg were part of a comedy troupe called &quot;David Icke and The Orphans of Jesus&quot;. Walliams and Diamond fell out after Walliams appeared as a guest on Diamond and his friend (and &quot;GamesMaster&quot; commentator) Kirk Ewing&#x27;s Paramount show &quot;Dom&#x27;n&#x27;Kirk&#x27;s Night O Plenty&quot; – after which Diamond said that Walliams and co-&quot;Little Britain&quot; star Matt Lucas were &quot;complete arseholes&quot; on the show. In a 2007 interview Diamond said that he had not spoken to Walliams since, whom he described as both a &quot;comic genius&quot; and a &quot;twat.&quot;

==Television and publications==
Diamond&#x27;s biggest role on television came presenting 6 series of Channel 4&#x27;s computer and video game show &quot;GamesMaster&quot;, which ran from 1992 to 1998. Diamond did not present the show&#x27;s third series, following disagreements with the show&#x27;s creators about Diamond&#x27;s desire to pursue business opportunities outside &quot;GamesMaster&quot; and the appointment of McDonald&#x27;s as the show&#x27;s sponsor. He went on to present the short-lived BBC Scotland panel show &quot;Caledonia McBrains&quot; in 2002.

In 2006, Diamond filmed a Five documentary, &quot;Crucify Me&quot;. During filming, he took part in the annual Holy Week re-enactment of the crucifixion at San Pedro Cutud in the Philippines. However, he backed down at the last minute, breaking into tears.

He also has appeared on the Discovery Real Time programme, &quot;Rubble Trouble&quot;, which charts the development of his house extension. While residing in Brighton from 2002 to 2004, he trained and worked as a bus driver with the local transport company Brighton and Hove Bus Company, recording his thoughts and feelings for a documentary to be shown on UK television Channel 5. Similarly to Diamond, many celebrities have worked for Brighton and Hove Bus Company, some of which are named on the front of the city&#x27;s buses.

Diamond&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Celtic &amp; Me: Confessions From The Jungle&quot;, was published in the UK by Black &amp; White Publishing in August 2010. The book is a combination of media memoir and the story of Diamond&#x27;s life as a fan of Celtic Football Club. In 2015, he became one of 44 financial backers for the short film &quot;Autumn Never Dies&quot;.

==Radio==
Diamond launched XFM Scotland with &quot;The Dominik Diamond Breakfast Show&quot; on XFM Scotland in January 2006. On 27 June 2007, RadioToday.co.uk announced that Diamond had joined Talk 107 to cover a number of programmes over the summer months. From 13 October 2007 Diamond presented the Dominik Diamond Breakfast Club on Talk 107. In January 2008 Dominik took over Talk 107 Drive with Marisa de Andrade. In April 2008, following a station revamp, the show became known as &quot;Diamond and de Andrade&quot;. Diamond left Talk 107; the station closed in December 2008.

He hosted The Dominik Diamond Show Mon–Fri 6–11pm on Q107 in Toronto. After a stint hosting on new music station Radio 96.5 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Diamond returned to the Toronto market in March 2014, replacing Dean Blundell as host of the morning show on 102.1 The Edge. From September 2015 to November 2018 he was the Morning Show host on 96.9 Jack FM in Calgary. In April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown, Dominik started a live-stream channel on Twitch.

<doc id="1002923" wikidata="Q1095721" url="?curid=1002923" title="Clark Johnson">
<text>Clark Johnson (born September 10, 1954) is an American-Canadian actor and director who has worked in both television and film. He is best known for his roles as David Jefferson in &quot;Night Heat&quot; (1985–1988), Clark Roberts in &quot;E.N.G.&quot; (1989–1994), Meldrick Lewis in &quot;&quot; (1993–1999) and Augustus Haynes in &quot;The Wire&quot; (2008). He is an Emmy Award and two-time Genie Award nominee.

==Early years==
Johnson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a Afro-Caribbean father from Trinidad and Tobago and a white mother. The family later moved to Canada. He has three siblings including jazz singer Molly Johnson and actress and singer Taborah Johnson.

Johnson attended Eastern Michigan University on a partial athletic scholarship for American football, but he was expelled after he was caught stealing food from the school cafeteria. He attended several other universities including the University of Ottawa and Loyola College/Concordia University, where he played Canadian football, before ending up at the Ontario College of Art as a film major. He was drafted by the Toronto Argonauts in the seventh round of the 1978 CFL Draft but ultimately did not play professionally.

==Career==
Johnson started in film doing special effects, including David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. This behind-the-scenes work often served as a &quot;backup&quot; for him during the early stages of his acting career.

He began performing in feature films in 1981, landing roles in the films &quot;Killing &#x27;em Softly&quot;, &quot;Colors&quot;, &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;, and &quot;Nowhere to Hide&quot;. He also acted in a number of television shows early in his career, including &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, &quot;Night Heat&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots&quot; and &quot;E.N.G.&quot;. He starred in the first episode of &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot; in 1989 as Butch Fuller.

===&quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot;===
In 1993, Johnson became part of the original cast of the television series &quot;&quot; playing Detective Meldrick Lewis for all seven seasons and the reunion movie, as well as directing several episodes. Johnson regularly improvised during filming and made up his own jokes and dialogue; writer and producer James Yoshimura called Clark the &quot;king of the ad lib&quot;. Although the ensemble nature of the show meant that Johnson never played a minor role, he became an even larger presence after his character was paired with a new partner, Mike Kellerman (played by Reed Diamond). The two detectives became the central figures in a plot line surrounding a Baltimore drug lord whose financial resources and front as a devoted community servant make it nearly impossible for the police department to charge him. Johnson made the transition to director with the season four episode &quot;Map of the Heart&quot;. He also directed &quot;Betrayal&quot;, &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Full Court Press&quot; and &quot;The Twenty Percent Solution&quot;. David Simon, the author of the non-fiction book &quot;Homicide&quot; was based upon, as well as a writer and producer for the series, commented that the transition from actor to director was made easy by Johnson&#x27;s familiarity with the show and that he was one of the better directors in terms of keeping the tone of the show consistent. In 2013, Johnson made a brief cameo as Lewis in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Wonderland Story&quot; when the squad are at a retirement party for John Munch (Richard Belzer).

===&quot;The Wire&quot;===
Johnson worked on &quot;The Wire&quot;, reuniting with writer David Simon. Johnson directed the pilot episode &quot;The Target&quot;, the second and fifth first-season episodes, and the series finale. He plays Augustus Haynes, the dedicated and principled editor for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; city desk.

===&quot;Alpha House&quot;===
In 2013, Johnson starred as Sen. Robert Bettencourt (R-PA) in Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Alpha House&quot;, a political comedy written by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; creator Garry Trudeau. Along with John Goodman, Johnson plays one of four Republican senators living together in a house on Capitol Hill. Johnson also directed the season finale for the show&#x27;s first season. Johnson spent the summer of 2014 filming season two.

===Directing===
Johnson&#x27;s other directing credits include the big-screen releases &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006) and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (2003), and episodes of &quot;Third Watch&quot; as well as the HBO original production &quot;Boycott&quot; (2001), a project which he helmed and in which he also acted. He also directed the first episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 of the 2005 mini-series &quot;Sleeper Cell&quot;. He also directed the first and last episodes of &quot;The Shield&quot;, along with other episodes of that series.

Johnson directed the pilot episode of the FX drama &quot;Lights Out&quot;. The series stars fellow &quot;The Wire&quot; cast members Pablo Schreiber and Reg E. Cathey and focuses on a retired heavyweight boxing champion.

Johnson is a guest instructor at HB Studio.

<text>Christopher Marsden (born 3 January 1969) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League and Premier League for Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town, Coventry City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Notts County, Stockport County, Birmingham City, Southampton and Sheffield Wednesday, and in the Korean K-League for Busan I&#x27;Park. He led Southampton to the 2003 FA Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 to Arsenal.

==Playing career==
Marsden was born in Sheffield and started his career with Sheffield United, going on to play for Huddersfield Town, Coventry City, Wolves, Notts County, Stockport County, Birmingham City, Southampton and Busan I&#x27;Park in South Korea.

He ended his career playing for Football League One club Sheffield Wednesday.

Marsden made 424 appearances in the Football League and scored 22 goals as a left footed midfield player and occasional defender. He first made an impression with Huddersfield Town in the early 1990s before successful spells at Stockport County and Birmingham City.

===Southampton===
Marsden played seven games in the Premiership for Coventry City in 1993 but did not play in the top flight again for a further six years (by which time he was 30) when he was brought to Southampton by then manager Dave Jones.

He captained Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 to Arsenal.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
After a short and unsuccessful spell at Busan I&#x27;Park, Marsden was snapped up on a free transfer by Chris Turner for Sheffield Wednesday. However, his career was cut short by a hamstring injury that forced him to retire.

<text>Rowland Taylor (sometimes spelled &quot;Tayler&quot;) (about 1510 – 9 February 1555) was an English Protestant martyr during the Marian Persecutions.

At the time of his death, he was Rector of Hadleigh in Suffolk. He was burnt at the stake at nearby Aldham Common.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born at Rothbury in Northumberland. In 1530, he received his LL.B. degree from the University of Cambridge. From 1531 to 1538 he was principal of Burden Hostel there. In 1534, he received the LL.D. from Cambridge, the same year Martin Luther completed his German Bible. One year later, in 1535, William Tyndale was tried and denounced as a heretic for his new English Bible translation. Tyndale was burned at the stake in 1536. 

==Religious career==
* In the late 1530s Taylor served as Hugh Latimer&#x27;s chaplain and commissary general of the diocese of Winchester.
* In March 1538 Taylor was collated by Latimer to the St Mary&#x27;s parish church of Hanbury, Worcestershire.
* When Latimer resigned, Taylor was taken under the wing of Thomas Cranmer, living with him and (1539) serving as his chaplain. He was ordained by Cranmer and admitted to the parish church of St Swithin&#x27;s in Worcester. He was thus given his licence to preach and did so in the diocese of London.
* On 16 April 1544, he was presented to the living of Hadleigh, Suffolk.
* In 1543 the English Parliament banned Tyndale&#x27;s English version and all public reading of the Bible by laymen. Religious persecution of Protestant clergy, especially by Roman Catholics, intensified in Britain at this time.
* In 1546 the Council of Trent, an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, decreed that the Latin Vulgate was the authoritative version of the Bible.
* In the summer of 1547, Taylor was employed as a preacher for the royal visitation within the dioceses of Lincoln, Oxford, Lichfield and Coventry.
* On 15 August 1547, he became canon of Rochester, the same year during which King Henry VIII had died in January.
* In 1548, Taylor was appointed archdeacon of Bury St Edmunds and preached at the request of the Lord Mayor at Whitsuntide or Pentecost.
* Edward VI, who reigned from 1547 to 1553, followed Henry VIII, and in 1549 the Book of Common Prayer became the Protestant liturgical text in England.
* In 1550, Taylor was called to serve on a commission against Anabaptists. The same year, he also helped to administer the vacant diocese of Norwich.
* In 1551, at age 41, Taylor was made archdeacon of Exeter in the diocese of Exeter, was also appointed one of the Six Preachers of Canterbury Cathedral and was appointed chancellor to Bishop Nicholas Ridley. His leadership was expanded by serving on a commission to revise the ecclesiastical laws.
* In 1552, he helped administer the vacant diocese of Worcester.

==Political troubles from 1553==

Taylor&#x27;s troubles began on 25 July 1553. He was arrested just six days after the new queen, Mary I, ascended the throne. Aside from the fact that Taylor had supported Lady Jane Grey, Mary&#x27;s rival, he was also charged with heresy for having preached a sermon in Bury St Edmunds denouncing the Roman Catholic practice of clerical celibacy, which required that a priest in holy orders be unmarried. Many English clergymen, including Taylor, had abandoned this teaching since the 1530s as a token of the English Reformation.

Taylor also denounced the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which is the belief that the two elements (bread and wine) taken during Holy Communion, or the Eucharist, actually become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Since the Roman Catholic position is that the Eucharist (and the miracle of transubstantiation) is a sacrament commanded by God, anyone denying it, particularly a cleric or pastor, is considered a heretic. This teaching was opposed universally by the Reformed and Protestant Churches, who maintained that, since a sacrament is a sign, it cannot also be the thing signified. For similar reasons relating to the problem of idolatry, Taylor took issue with the Roman Catholic form of the Mass and received much support from the people of Hadleigh. 

These issues came to a head after Edward VI died (6 July 1553) and was succeeded by Queen Mary I. In 1554, Mary began a programme of re-establishing Catholicism in England. However, the English clergy and Anglican faithful, whose hopes for a Protestant royal succession had been dashed by Mary&#x27;s imprisonment and execution of Lady Jane Grey, saw it as a matter of English Christian duty to resist this backlash, not least to resist the political ambitions of the king of Spain (Philip II, whom Mary married) to draw England within the sphere of the Holy Roman Empire and its Roman Catholic satellites. Although Mary, as Henry VIII&#x27;s eldest daughter, was a legitimate successor to Edward VI, England was no longer minded to tolerate a Roman Catholic monarch, and the courage and endurance unto death of men such as Taylor provided the public example which ensured that the Reformation was not in fact overturned, but became established in the realm of England.

On 26 March 1554, the Privy Council ordered the arrest of Taylor, and he thus appeared before Bishop Stephen Gardiner. The proceedings against Taylor ran over several months. During this time he was kept in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. While in prison he befriended many inmates and was instrumental in many conversions to Anglicanism.

==Trial and martyrdom==

January 1555 was an ominous month for Anglican clergy in England. After several years of separation from Roman worship and governance, the accession of Mary I in 1553 and her immediate reversion to Roman Catholic rule in obedience to the Pope (an attempt to turn back the Reformation of the English church) led her to unleash her wrath upon those whom she defined as treasonably minded heretics. On 22 January 1555, Rowland Taylor (rector of Hadleigh in Suffolk) and several other clergy, including John Hooper, were examined by a commission of leading bishops and lawyers. As Lord Chancellor, Gardiner presided at the hearings. Just two days previously, on 20 January, Parliament had revived the old statute for burning convicted heretics.

One of the men, Edward Crome, recanted and was thus pardoned. William Barlow equivocated and was sent to the Tower of London, but not executed. Rowland Taylor, who remained committed, was probably taken to Poultry Compter Prison in London after his examination by Gardiner. Taylor gave a fervent defence of clerical marriage, which put him at odds with the Roman Catholic Church. 

On 29 January 1555, Taylor was brought before Gardiner again at St Mary&#x27;s. The next day he was excommunicated and sentenced to death. He was stripped of his clerical garments in a symbolic manner, and offered a last supper with his family. 

His reaction to his accusers, as recorded by the martyrologist John Foxe, was this:

And although I know, that there is neither justice nor truth to be looked for at my adversaries hands, but rather imprisonment and cruel death: yet know my cause to be so good and righteous, and the truth so strong upon my side, that I will by God&#x27;s grace go and appear before them and to their beards resist their false doings.

==Final words==
 His wife awaited him in the early morning hours at St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate churchyard in London; they exchanged a few last brief words and Margaret promised to be present for his burning in a couple of days. That same day, Taylor was handed over to the sheriff of Essex at Chelmsford. Before he was handed over, he spoke these words to his family:

I say to my wife, and to my children, The Lord gave you unto me, and the Lord hath taken me from you, and you from me: blessed be the name of the Lord! I believe that they are blessed which die in the Lord. God careth for sparrows, and for the hairs of our heads. I have ever found Him more faithful and favourable, than is any father or husband. Trust ye therefore in Him by the means of our dear Saviour Christ&#x27;s merits: believe, love, fear, and obey Him: pray to Him, for He hath promised to help. Count me not dead, for I shall certainly live, and never die. I go before, and you shall follow after, to our long home.

Taylor was taken from London back to Hadleigh, and was held in the cellar of Lavenham Guildhall. Following John Rogers on 4 February and Lawrence Saunders on 8 February, Taylor became Mary&#x27;s third Protestant to be burned at the stake. His execution took place on 9 February 1555, at Aldham Common just north of Hadleigh. His wife, two daughters, and his son Thomas were present that day. 

His final words to his son Thomas, as reported by Foxe:

Almighty God bless thee, and give you his Holy Spirit, to be a true servant of Christ, to learn his word, and constantly to stand by his truth all the life long. And my son, see that thou fear God always. Fly from all sin and wicked living. Be virtuous, serve God daily with prayer, and apply thy boke. In anywise see thou be obedient to thy mother, love her, and serve her. Be ruled by her now in thy youth, and follow her good counsel in all things. Beware of lewd company of young men, that fear not God, but followeth their lewd lusts and vain appetites. Flee from whoredom, and hate all filthy lying, remembering that I thy father do die in the defense of holy marriage. And another day when God shall bless thee, love and cherish the poor people, and count that thy chief riches to be rich in alms. And when thy mother is waxed old, forsake her not, but provide for her to thy power, and see that she lacks nothing. For so will God bless thee, give thee long life upon earth, and prosperity, which I pray God to grant thee.

A local butcher was ordered to set a torch to the wood but resisted. A couple of bystanders finally threw a lighted torch onto the wood. A perhaps sympathetic guard, named Warwick, struck Taylor&#x27;s head with a halberd, which apparently killed him instantly. The fire consumed his body shortly thereafter. That same day, John Hooper was burned at the stake in Gloucester.

==Memorials==

An unhewn stone, probably dating from the early 17th century, marks the place of Taylor&#x27;s death at Aldham Common, where the B1070 Lady Lane meets the A1071 Ipswich Road. The stone is inscribed:

Next to the unhewn stone, there is also a pyramidal stone monument erected in 1818, and restored by parishioners in 1882. The monument has verses written by Nathan Drake painted on it. It is a Grade II listed building.

In St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hadleigh, the south-east window in St John&#x27;s Chapel commemorates Taylor.

<doc id="1002960" wikidata="Q17112651" url="?curid=1002960" title="Non Sequitur (comic strip)">
<text>Non Sequitur is a comic strip created by Wiley Miller (credited mononymously as Wiley) starting February 16, 1992 and syndicated by Andrews McMeel Syndication to over 700 newspapers. It is also published on gocomics.com and distributed via email.

Translated from Latin as &quot;it does not follow&quot;, &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; is often political and satirical, though other times, purely comedic.

The strip has undergone many changes through its history. Originally, the comic was a single panel gag cartoon, similar to Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot;. It grew more political (from a moderately liberal perspective) in tone during the 1990s, to the point where it often became a borderline editorial cartoon. Today, the comic has become more traditional, sometimes using a multi-panel format and recurring characters. The horizontal daily strip is sometimes used as a
single panel. The Sunday strip is vertical.

&quot;Non Sequitur&quot; has been honored with four National Cartoonists Society Awards, including the Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1995, 1996 and 1998, and the Newspaper Panels Award for 2002. It is the only comic strip to win in its first year of syndication and the only title to ever win both the best comic strip and best comic panel categories.
== Characters in Whatchacallit, Maine ==

===The Pyles===
Originally Danae, Joe and &quot;Offshore&quot; Flo were separate characters in their own segments but their storylines were eventually fused and they were billed as being family. Joe and his daughters moved to his native New England to live near his mother following his divorce and withdrawal from major media outlets.

====Joe====
Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Pyle is an unemployed former host of the talk radio program &quot;NoozTube&quot;, often frustrated by how mass media treats him, and used by the strip to comment on the media. As the cast of characters grew and merged, he became the often-bewildered father of Danae and Kate. His name may be a reference to the confrontational conservative talk show host, Joe Pyne, but is equally likely to be a tribute to beloved World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle; Joe thus represents the love-and-hate relationship many mainstream Americans have with the media. In his early appearances, Joe looked much like former President George H. W. Bush, whose family has a home in Maine.

His ex-wife and Danae and Kate&#x27;s mother, Jennifer Pyle, is not seen and seldom referred to. She is said to have run off with a biker while the family was on a trip to New Hampshire.

====Danae====
Danae Pyle is a pre-adolescent girl with a pessimistic view of the world (but not of herself), often employed in the strip for satirical purposes. First appearing in the strip in 1998 with her sister Kate and parents (it can be assumed that this was set before their divorce), she is the most famous character of the strip and frequently its leading character.

====Kate====
Kate Pyle is the more optimistic sister of Danae. Often used as a foil to Danae in how their personalities and view of the world differ. The frequency of her appearances diminished with the creation of Lucy, who started acting as Danae&#x27;s straight man.

====Flo====
Florence &quot;Flo&quot; Pyle is Joe&#x27;s mother and owns Flo&#x27;s Offshore Diner in Whatchacallit, Maine. Miller commented, &quot;I created a series of characters that came from our visits to Maine. &#x27;Offshore&#x27; Flo is patterned after the Maine Diner in Wells. I wanted to capture the essence of Maine people&#x27;s genuineness—down-to-earth, good-natured people—and work in the accent... It&#x27;s set in Whatchacallit, Maine.&quot; Flo often can be seen with a coffee maker&#x27;s pot in her hand, though her diner also serves liquor, which is the source of Captain Eddie&#x27;s tall tales.

====Bob====
Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Pyle is Joe&#x27;s brother, often seen having a drink with him at a bar. He often tries to convince Joe to take a hold of get-rich-quick professions or become a cable news show host. According to the strip of January 15, 2003, he is an attorney, and in the strips of May 28–29, 2007, it is indicated he has a practice and has spent twenty years representing personal injury cases. He is single and avoids relationships with women. 

According to Wiley Miller, Bob is patterned after his favorite character actor, Dabney Coleman, not just in appearance but in his sharp demeanor.

====Uncle Reginald====
Uncle Reginald Pyle is the ghost of an alcoholic elderly relative haunting Joe&#x27;s house. Sometimes the reader is given a glimpse into an alternate world (perhaps the past as well) where Reginald is still alive. In this reality, he lives with his brother Montgomery &quot;Monty&quot; Pyle in a large, Victorian mansion with numerous servants including Smithers, the butler. Danae, Kate and Flo are well acquainted with Reginald, but Joe refuses to believe he exists in ghost form.

===Other characters===

====Brenda====
Brenda Santa Fe runs Brenda&#x27;s Clam Hut and is a frequent visitor of Flo&#x27;s Offshore Diner (possibly since her restaurant does not run into the night hours, like a diner does). She can frequently be seen in the latter as a customer while Captain Eddie tells his stories. She has a crush on Joe, but after Joe showed little interest, she ran off with another man. She sometimes wore a sweatshirt displaying the letters &quot;KPT&quot;, a common abbreviation for Kennebunkport, Maine.

====Victoria====
Victoria Santa Fe is Brenda&#x27;s older sister. She is much more brash than Brenda, and originally showed less interest in Joe. They began dating eventually, however, and Joe&#x27;s family frequently urged him to propose to her. She works at Brenda&#x27;s Clam Hut. On the last day of 2009 she appeared with a &quot;pre-marriage agreement questionnaire&quot; for Joe. Flo says she did not know they were dating, much less engaged, and Joe responds &quot;Neither did I.&quot; Over the next three weeks Joe successfully answers all the questions and they become engaged. On January 18, 2010, Danae finds out they are engaged.

====Jeffrey====
Jeffrey is a fairly nerdy boy in Danae&#x27;s class who has a crush on her. In &quot;Non Sequitur Sunday Color Treasury&quot;, the author describes how he was inspired by a reader to create the character.

====Jack====
Jack is Jeffrey&#x27;s autistic 6-year-old younger brother, based on Miller&#x27;s grandson, introduced March 29, 2020.

====Lars====
Lars is a Martian who appeared, beginning on May 2, 2009, in a series of strips that involved Jeffrey building a spaceship and going on an expedition to Mars. Lars acted as a helper in building the spaceship and a guide on Mars. Before Lars&#x27; appearance, Danae came along to see Jeffrey building the spaceship—consequently making her appear in the rest of the story.

====Captain Eddie ====
Captain Eddie is a commercial fisherman from Maine (with the associated accent) who continually tells tall tales of his boating expeditions, usually involving giant lobsters or aliens, to anyone who will listen in Flo&#x27;s coffee shop. 

====Fern====
Fern is a classmate of Danae. She was first introduced in April 14, 2021. She seems Asian-American. 

===The Graevsytes===
Introduced on September 8, 2002, the Graevsytes bear similarities to The Addams Family. The Graevsytes also appeared in Danae&#x27;s Halloween series in October and November 2002.

====Horace====
Horace Graevsyte, the father, carries his head on a plate (he seems to be a ghost of a decapitated man).

====Miranda====
Miranda Graevsyte, the mother, floats around the house.

====Boyle====
Boyle Graevsyte, a teenage boy, bears some resemblance to Jason Voorhees from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; films.

====Mimi====
(Screaming) Mimi Graevsyte is the daughter and a baby.

===Pets===

====Lucy====
Lucy is a talking pygmy Clydesdale who, like Hobbes of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, plays the silent observer most of the time. Lucy was introduced in the July 11, 2003 strip, in a storyline that had Danae and Kate going to a summer horse riding camp. At the end of the summer, Danae became good friends with Lucy and took her home. Unlike Hobbes, however, Lucy is a &quot;real&quot; horse who the kids talk to and interact with the same as any other character, nor is she invisible to adults.

====Petey====
Petey is dog of humble origins who has found his way into Kate&#x27;s ownership. He can also talk to Danae and Kate. He constantly lets Rölf get him in trouble.

====Rölf====
Rölf is Brenda&#x27;s dog and Petey&#x27;s friend. The size of his muzzle far exceeds his brains. He&#x27;s also a symbol of the strip and can be seen in the cover of &quot;Non Sequitur&#x27;s Beastly Things&quot;. Rölf (or an ancestor or relative from an earlier or alternate era) has also appeared in a short-lived series in &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; called &quot;B.E&quot;.

====Paulie====
Paulie is Captain Eddie&#x27;s cat who is always with Eddie, accompanying him on his various fictional adventures, and usually sits on his shoulder, in place of the usual parrot accompanying a pirate.

== Other recurring characters ==
The majority of these characters only or mostly appear in Sunday strips.

===Obviousman===
Obviousman is a superhero who can&#x27;t stand the overly obvious or hypocritical. His symbol is the word &quot;Duh&quot; with a slash through it (No Duh!). Usually appears only on Sundays.

He has appeared being interviewed by Joe on his radio show. Obviousman&#x27;s secret identity is Mark Cohen, a California realtor and amateur magician, who has taken on a mission in life of freeing the people from the curse of mindless obedience to the dictates of the mass media, and to at least slow, if not reverse, the dumbing down of America. His nemesis is Professor Obfuscate.

In the book &quot;Non Sequitur&#x27;s Sunday Color Treasury&quot;, Miller stated that he named Obviousman&#x27;s true identity after a friend who had died of cancer in 1999. The real Mark Cohen was a realtor and an avid collector of comics and original comic book art. Miller explained, &quot;This was my way of memorializing him. He was dearly loved throughout our profession as a great ambassador of comics as an art form.&quot;

An animated short, &quot;Obviousman: The Movie&quot;, can currently be found on the &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; website. Wiley Miller voices Obviousman.

===Ordinary Basil===
Ordinary Basil is a boy at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution who takes a journey to the cloud city of Helios. Story ran on Sundays from February 20 to July 24, 2005. Another story began on September 9, 2007 with a Sunday strip &quot;The Return of Ordinary Basil&quot; reviewing events thus far appearing on September 2 and concluded on January 6, 2008.

===Ele===
Ele (Extinction Level Event) is a cynical cat-like creature who lives in the time before man. Appearing in Sunday strips only, she has appeared in two major runs—one from 2000 up to July 2001, and one in early 2006.

===Homer===
Homer, called Honor in his female incarnations, is a departed soul who aside from dealing with living in the afterlife has to deal with real life whenever he returns to earth. He has been an ancient Roman (who barely escaped Pompeii), a medieval peasant, a cavewoman, and a female immigrant. Homer was developed into a spin-off strip called &quot;Homer the Reluctant Soul&quot;, which Wiley attempted to market online, and featured in a book by the same title.

===Pierre of the North===
Pierre of the North (a play off of Nanook of the North) is a French Canadian who hates &quot;ze&quot; cold and finds himself at odds with very clever (and very hungry) polar bears.

===Lucifer===
Lucifer (that is, Satan) often appears in the strip to delegate hellish punishments, such as watching reality shows.

===St. Peter===
St. Peter guards the gates of heaven and has interacted with numerous characters including Captain Eddie.

===The bulldog===
In numerous strips that deal with the home life of upper middle-aged couples, a pet bulldog with exaggerated fangs (similar to Rölf&#x27;s, above) can be seen.

===The Bears===
A group of anthropomorphic bears (brown bears, unrelated to Pierre of the North&#x27;s polar bears, above) often appear, usually seen trying to entice humans into their grasp, presumably for eating.

==Controversies==
===&quot;New Straits Times&quot; controversy===
&quot;Non Sequitur&quot; was published in the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, a major newspaper in the Muslim-majority country of Malaysia, as part of its weekday line of comic strips. The comic, however, generated controversy in the country and its government following the paper&#x27;s printing of the syndicated strip satirizing the protests over the controversial &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons on February 20, 2006. The cartoon depicts a street-side cartoonist offering caricatures of Muhammad &quot;while you wait&quot; with a caption stating that the cartoonist has finally realized his goal of being the most feared man in the world.

The &quot;New Straits Times&quot; subsequently issued an apology. Wiley Miller commented on Malaysia&#x27;s response to the strip, stating in a February 1, 2007 interview that it is &quot;much ado about nothing.&quot;

===Hidden message to Donald Trump controversy===
The February 10, 2019 edition of &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; contained as an &quot;easter egg&quot; a hidden message to President Donald Trump. The strip parodied the art of Leonardo da Vinci with anthropomorphic bears, and featured several mostly-illegible scribbles, one of which contained the phrase &quot;go fuck yourself Trump&quot;. Wiley confirmed the message and apologized, explaining that it was an oversight that he had meant to rectify. However, his Twitter post contradicted what he said in his apology. Multiple newspapers discontinued carrying the strip in response.

<doc id="1002963" wikidata="Q11702782" url="?curid=1002963" title="Gatun Dam">
<text>The Gatun Dam is an earthen dam across the Chagres River in Panama, near the town of Gatun. The dam, constructed between 1907 and 1913, is a crucial element of the Panama Canal; it impounds the artificial Gatun Lake, which carries ships of their transit across the Isthmus of Panama. In addition, a hydro-electric generating station at the dam generates electricity which is used to operate the locks and other equipment in the canal.

Construction of the dam was a great engineering achievement, eclipsed only by the parallel excavation of the Culebra Cut; at the time of completion, the dam was the largest earth dam in the world, and Gatun Lake was the largest artificial lake in the world.

== Description ==
The dam is situated in the valley of the Chagres River, about from its mouth in the Caribbean Sea. The hills bordering the valley of the Chagres form a gap just over wide at this point, with a natural rocky hill in the centre of the gap. The gap is filled by an earth dam, thick at the base, long along the top, thick at the water level, and thick at the top, which is above the normal lake level.

The spillway for the dam is constructed on the central hill; it consists of a semi-circular concrete dam, which regulates the flow of water down a concrete channel built into the back slope of the hill. The spillway dam itself measures along the top; its crest is at below the normal lake level. The spillway is designed so that water pouring over the semi-circular dam converges at the bottom from opposite directions and neutralises its own force, thus minimising erosion below.

The spillway dam is topped by 14 gates, supported by concrete piers and each wide by high. These gates, which are electrically operated, are raised or lowered to control the flow of water; with the lake level at , its planned maximum level, the capacity of the spillway is per second, more than the maximum flow of the Chagres River. In addition to this, the culverts in the locks can dispose of per second. 

Gatun Lake has an area of at its normal level; it stores of water, which is about as much as the Chagres River brings down in an average year.

== Power generation ==

The dam incorporates a hydro-electric generating station, which is situated on the east side of the spillway discharge channel. This uses water from the lake to drive a number of turbine-generators; as first commissioned, three generators were installed, producing a total of of electricity. The power generated is used for the operation of the lock and spillway machinery, and for the lighting of the locks and the canal villages.

== Construction ==
The canal effort was begun by a French company (&quot;La Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interoceanique&quot;) in 1880 to 1889. With poor exploration of the options and with poor information of the costs, the French company planned to construct a sea-level canal linking the two coasts. They initially thought they could do this for about $120 million. After spending about one billion Francs (about $300,000,000), losing about 22,000 workers and going bankrupt, the French effort essentially ceased. A sea level canal would not have required the dam to be built but would have still required extensive provisions made to accommodate the ever-changing Chagres River flow. The United States took over the wide Canal Zone and resumed building the canal on 4 May 1904. Almost two years were spent in infra-structure preparation, mosquito abatement (the newly discovered vector spreading Yellow fever and Malaria), Panama Railroad improvements, and planning before the work got up to full speed. After reviewing the options and costs, in 1906 a lock-based canal was decided upon and agreed to by President Theodore Roosevelt.

Even before the lock canal decision was made, Major George Washington Goethals (United States Army Corps of Engineers), the chief engineer from 1907 to 1914 of the construction effort, had already carried out an investigation under John Frank Stevens (chief engineer, 1905–1907) into determining the suitability of the land at Gatun for the building of a large dam there. Extensive test borings were made to determine the suitability of the land, and pressure tests were carried out on the material to be used in construction to determine its durability.

The Gatun Dam serves two important purposes: it controls the ever varying Chagres River and creates Gatun Lake. The lake at about elevation provides an elevated path for ships across most of the Isthmus of Panama including through the treacherous V-shaped Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut). This saved excavating literally millions of cubic yards of material that would have been necessary for a sea-level canal. The lake height is regulated by spillways that control the water flow out of the dam to obtain an almost constant height in wet or dry seasons. The lake also acts as a massive reservoir to work the locks on both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean ends of the canal and provides via hydro-electric generators about 6 MW of electrical power needed to run the locks and dam. After finishing the dam and filling Gatun Lake it was dredged where necessary to obtain a clear ship channel across the lake.

The Gatun location was in most ways ideal for a dam; upstream of the dam site the hills enclosing the Chagres River opened very wide around the area that is now Gatun Lake. Over a narrow gap the hills close to a relatively narrow gap with a natural rock-based channel in the centre. This allows a moderately sized dam to enclose a huge body of water, which both provides passage for ships across much of the isthmus, and provides a reservoir of water with which to operate the locks. The central hill was the ideal solid base for the construction of the concrete spillway and its dam, the main part of the dam being earth. The only problem was the huge scale of the dam required massive rock and dirt fill that was provided by about 100 trainloads of waste rock deposited into two parallel walls of waste rock about apart every day for several years from the Gaillard Cut (now called the Culebra Cut) and the Gatun Locks excavation. Between these waste rock walls an impervious core was created by using a hydraulic fill technique which pumped millions of cubic yards of clay material and water into the area between the rock walls. This fill was made by digging up the soft clay present in the valley below, where dredges excavated the clay and water and loaded it into pumps that delivered it up into a pond created between the inner and outer walls of the dam. The pumped mixture was allowed to sit until the clay settled out, with the excess water being drawn off and pumped back downstream. This dried and hardened material created a solid core of &quot;natural&quot; cement at the core of the dam.

After the dam was built to its desired height, the entire up-stream side was armored to prevent wave action damaging the dam by placing large boulders on the face, particularly where there is strong wave action.

The dam contains some of material and is about wide at its base, about high and long. The dam weighs some . It covers of ground, and contains enough earth and rock to build a wall metres high and 29 cm thick (or four foot eight inches high and a foot thick) around the Earth at the equator.

==Water level==
After the opening of the Panama Canal, it was found that the water level impounded by the dam did not stay constant enough during the dry season for the operation of the canal. The Madden Dam was constructed much higher up the Chagres River to provide a reservoir and hydroelectric power for Panama City, opening in 1935.

<text>Zuckerman Bound is a trilogy of novels by Philip Roth, originally published in 1985.

==Plot==
Each of the books follows the struggles and writing career of Roth&#x27;s novelist alter ego Nathan Zuckerman.

==Contents==
The bound trilogy consists of:

*&quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Zuckerman Unbound&quot; (1981)
*&quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot; (1983)

And an epilogue:

*&quot;The Prague Orgy&quot; (1985)

==Reception==
&quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; met with great acclaim upon publication. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; critic Harold Bloom wrote, Zuckerman Bound&#x27; merits something reasonably close to the highest level of esthetic praise for tragicomedy, partly because as a formal totality it becomes much more than the sum of its parts.&quot;

After Roth&#x27;s passing, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked several prominent authors to name their favorite work by Roth. Adrian Tomine selected &quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot;, writing: &quot;By design, these linked stories have the ring of autobiographical truth, like an unsparing series of dispatches from the front lines of, well, being a wildly talented, successful and complicated writer from New Jersey at the end of the twentieth century. I actually have no idea how closely the narratives correlate with the author’s real life, but these, more than any other of Roth’s books, strike me as someone perfectly articulating the one thing he is an absolute authority on: How the world looks, feels and sounds to him. They’re the stories that first come to mind when I think of Philip Roth, and they’re the ones that I’ve returned to the most.&quot;

==Different editions==

The Library of America edition, &quot;Zuckerman Bound: A Trilogy &amp; Epilogue 1979–1985&quot;, also includes a previously unpublished television screenplay for &quot;The Prague Orgy&quot;.

<doc id="1002971" wikidata="Q2270858" url="?curid=1002971" title="Mulifanua">
<text>Mulifanua is a village on the north-western tip of the island of Upolu, in Samoa. In the modern era, it is the capital of Aiga-i-le-Tai district. Mulifanua wharf is the main ferry terminal for inter-island vehicle and passenger travel across the Apolima Strait between Upolu and the island of Savai&#x27;i.

==Ferry terminal==

The ferry terminal at Mulifanua wharf is five minutes west of Faleolo International Airport. The government&#x27;s Samoa Shipping Corporation operates the ferry service, seven days a week, between Mulifanua and Salelologa at the east end of Savai&#x27;i island. A one-way trip between the two islands takes about 90 minutes. The ferry usually runs every two hours during the day. There are several small shops selling snacks, and there are always buses and taxis available at the terminal for departures and arrivals.

==Archaeology==

In 1973, archaeology in Samoa uncovered a Lapita site at Mulifanua where 4,288 pottery sherds and two Lapita type adzes have been recovered. The site has a true age of circa 3,000 BP based on C14 dating on a shell. This is the only site in Samoa where decorated Lapita sherds have been found, although pieces of Polynesian plainware ceramics are commonly found throughout the Samoan islands. The submerged site was discovered during work carried out to expand the inter-island ferry berth at Mulifanua.

==2007 South Pacific Games==
&quot;Aggie Grey’s Resort and Spa&quot; at Mulifanua and Faleolo was the venue for the sailing and va&#x27;a (outrigger canoeing) events at the 2007 South Pacific Games.

<doc id="1002973" wikidata="Q4873023" url="?curid=1002973" title="Battle of the Tennis Court">
<text>The Battle of the Tennis Court was part of the wider Battle of Kohima that was fought in North East India from 4 April to 22 June 1944 during the Burma Campaign of the Second World War. The Japanese advance into India was halted at Kohima in April 1944 and Garrison Hill, on a long wooded ridge on a high ridge west of the village, was, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission the scene of &quot;perhaps the most bitter fighting of the whole Burma campaign when a small Commonwealth force held out against repeated attacks by a Japanese Division&quot;. During the siege of Kohima, heavy fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, occurred in the grounds surrounding the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s bungalow, including the tennis court, beginning around 8 April and continuing until 13 May when the assaulting Japanese troops began withdrawing from the area.

==Prelude==
Kohima Ridge was about a mile long and about 400 yards wide, with a series of hills and gullies that ran alongside the road from Imphal to Dimapur. The steep slopes along the road made the ridge a formidable target for attackers, but it was a narrow space from which to repel an enemy attacking in strength. In March 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-Go, a large-scale invasion of India. By 6 the British, Nepalese and Indian soldiers of Kohima Garrison had been surrounded on the Kohima ridge. As the siege began the Kohima Ridge was defended to the south (facing Imphal) by the 1st Assam Regiment on Jail Hill. The centre ground of the ridge was mainly defended by 4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment. The North West of the Ridge, known as Hospital Spur, was defended by the 3rd Assam Rifles who were facing the road to Dimapur. The North East of the Ridge on a sharp corner in the road was where the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Charles Pawsey&#x27;s Bungalow and Tennis Court was situated. This was initially guarded by a composite group of soldiers, thought to be British and Gurkha troops from the local Reinforcement Depot.

==Battle==
The Japanese launched a series of attacks into the north-east region of the defences on 8 April, including two attacks on the DC&#x27;s Bungalow area. The Japanese suffered massive losses, but poured in reinforcements to prepare for another attack. Some Allied soldiers manned a Bren gun to cover the withdrawal from the DC&#x27;s Bungalow to the other side of the asphalt tennis court 12m higher up the hill. They held on to the last round but were then overrun, bayoneted and shot. At this stage the Battle of the Tennis Court could be said to have begun with the area being rapidly reinforced by A Company of the 4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment.

During 9 April and before dawn on 10 April the Japanese 58 Regiment attacked the Allied defenders of the Tennis Court area almost every 30 minutes. Major Tom Kenyon, officer commanding (OC) A Company of the 4th Royal West Kents, commanded the British, Indian and Gurkha defenders who had now dug weapon pits and trenches on the western edge of the tennis court. During 10 April these defences and the overhead cover saved many lives as artillery shells landed on the Allied positions. The forward trenches ran out of ammunition on several occasions but were repeatedly resupplied by Sergeant Williams, who was awarded a Military Medal for his bravery.

The decision was made on 12 April to relieve the defenders of the Tennis Court with B Company of the 4th Royal West Kents, commanded by Major John Winstanley. During B Company&#x27;s first night defending the Tennis Court, the Japanese forces attacked silently, wearing plimsoll shoes, instead of boots. They nearly overran the British forward positions with one of the platoon commanders, Lieutenant Tom Hogg, surviving a bayonet attack before firing all 25 rounds from his weapon (probably a Bren light machine gun), killing his assailant.

On 13 April, heavy Japanese artillery and mortar fire fell around the DC&#x27;s bungalow and the tennis court area. Several assaults were made by Japanese infantry, although these were repelled in what the British Ministry of Defence describes as &quot;some of the hardest, closest and grimmest fighting, with grenades being hurled across the tennis court at point-blank range&quot;. But on 14 April the Japanese did not launch an attack, and on 15 April the British and Indian troops on Kohima ridge heard that the British 2nd Infantry Division was attacking along the Dimapur–Kohima road and had broken through Japanese roadblocks to relieve troops of the 161st Indian Infantry Brigade around Jotsoma, about west of Kohima.

On 17 April, the Japanese tried one last time to take the ridge and captured Field Supply Depot (FSD) Hill and Kuki Piquet. On the morning of 18 April, British artillery opened up from the west against the Japanese positions, which stopped the Japanese attacks. Elements of the British 2nd Division, the 161st Indian Brigade and tanks from XXXIII Corps pushed into the area north-west of Garrison Hill and forced the Japanese from their positions. The road between Dimapur and Kohima had been opened and the siege was lifted.

Part of the Allied force relieving the siege was the 1/1st Punjab Regiment of the 161st Indian Brigade. By the evening of 18 April, D Company of 1/1st Punjab Regiment (Major Gavin Dunnett) were facing the Japanese forces in the Tennis Court area. They were attacked almost immediately by the 58th Infantry Regiment, a battle in which a South East Asia Command Public Relations officer later reported &quot;a grenade match was played across the bungalow&#x27;s tennis courts&quot;. The 1/1st Punjab Regiment took 22 casualties and lost ground, only to retake it again the following day (19 April) during which Jemadar Mohammed Rafiq was awarded the Military Cross for leading his platoon against Japanese bunkers. The 1/1st Punjab Regiment seem to have moved rearwards on 21 April, having suffered 120 casualties, to be replaced by C Company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, part of the 6th Brigade of the British 2nd Division, who were themselves relieved by D Company of the same battalion on 23 April.

The Japanese who had been fighting to capture Kohima did not retreat at once. Many of them stayed in the positions which they had captured and fought tenaciously for several more weeks. It is not entirely clear when the battle for the Tennis Court was won, but tanks operating from the road supported an infantry attack that captured the Tennis Court area on 10 May 1944. By the morning of 13 May, most of the positions on the Kohima ridge had been re-taken by the British and Indian forces. On that day the DC&#x27;s bungalow was finally recaptured by the 2nd Battalion, Dorset Regiment supported by Grant tanks firing from the Tennis Court. The lead tank was driven by Sergeant Waterhouse of 149th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (149th RAC), firing his gun into Japanese bunkers at no more than . This tank was supported by two platoons of the Dorsets commanded by Sergeants Given and Cook. The Allied breakthrough that ended the Battle of the Tennis Court is depicted in a 1982 painting by Terence Cuneo which is displayed in the Kohima Museum in Imphal Barracks, York.

The fighting within the 6th Brigade&#x27;s area was documented by Major Boshell, who commanded &#x27;B&#x27; Company of the 1st Royal Berkshires, in the 6th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division:

==Aftermath==
Around 15 May the Japanese 31st Division began to withdraw and the fresh British and Indian troops from XXXIII Corps began to reinforce and relieve the British 2nd Division and the 33rd and 161st Indian Brigades. In the aftermath of the fighting around Kohima, the troops of the Fourteenth Army began an advance, with the relief of Imphal, which would continue until Burma had been recaptured. The battle was the turning point of the Battle of Kohima which was the watershed of the Burma Campaign. Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, described Kohima as

The Imperial War Museum Duxford has a diorama of the battle, amongst others.

<doc id="1002978" wikidata="Q4989843" url="?curid=1002978" title="Warlpiri people">
<text>The Warlpiri, sometimes referred to as Yapa, are a group of Aboriginal Australians defined by their Warlpiri language, although not all still speak it. There are 5,000–6,000 Warlpiri, living mostly in a few towns and settlements scattered through their traditional land in the Northern Territory, north and west of Alice Springs (Mparntwe). About 3,000 people still speak the Warlpiri language. The word &quot;Warlpiri&quot; has also been romanised as Walpiri, Walbiri, Elpira, Ilpara, and Wailbri.

==Language==

The Warlpiri language is a member of the Ngumpin-Yapa subgroup of the Pama-Nyungan family of languages. The name &quot;Yapa&quot; comes from the word for &quot;person&quot;, and is also used by the Warlpiri people to refer to themselves, as Indigenous people rather than &quot;kardiya&quot; (non-Indigenous).

The closest relative to Warlpiri is Warlmanpa. It has four main dialects; Yuendumu Warlpiri, in the south-west, Willowra Warlpiri, in the central area, around the Lander River, the northern dialect, Lajamanu Warlpiri, and the eastern dialect Wakirti Warlpiri, spoken on the Hanson River. Most Warlpiri-speakers are bilingual or multilingual, English being their second, or perhaps third, fourth or fifth language. The younger generation of Warlpiri people at Lajamanu have developed a new language, light Warlpiri, based on an amalgamation of words and syntax from Warlpiri, English and Kriol. Many also speak other languages, such as Arrernte, Jaru, Western Desert Language, Warumungu. Warlpiri Sign Language (Rdaka-rdaka) is also an important component of Warlpiri communication, as many of 600 distinct signs being used.

Thus a sentence like &quot;ga&quot; (present tense) &quot;na&quot; (1) &quot;jani&quot; (am going) (2) &quot;jadidjara&quot; (3) (the north) &quot;gura&quot; (4) (towards &quot;binga&quot; (a long way)(5)-&quot;dju&quot;. (6) (emphatic)

Can be said with the same syntax, in gestures: &#x27;(1) touch chest/ (2) move right index finger/ (3) point north/ (4) with lips/ (5) click fingers (6) towards north.

Kenneth Hale, an American linguist, learned the Warlpiri language and was adopted by the tribe, who knew him as &quot;Jabanungga&quot;. On returning to the United States, he raised his twin sons, Caleb and Ezra, in the Warlpiri tongue, and Ezra delivered the eulogy at Hale&#x27;s funeral in that language.

==Country==
Warlpiri country is located in the Tanami Desert, east of the Northern Territory-Western Australia border, west of the Stuart Highway and Tennant Creek, and northwest of Alice Springs. Traditional Warlpiri territory has been estimated to cover some . Many Warlpiri people live in Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine, and the smaller towns of Central Australia. Their largest communities are at Lajamanu, Nyirripi, Yuendumu, Alekarenge and Wirlyajarrayi/Willowra.

Warlpiri traditional territory was resource-poor from the European perspective, and lay a considerable distance away from the main telegraph routes and highway infrastructure built by Europeans, a fact which meant they were not affected by these intrusive developments, allowing their culture to remain relatively intact and flourishing, unlike the Anmatyerre, the Kaytetye, Warumungu, Warlmanpa, Mudbura and Jingili peoples. One consequence of this is that by the 1980s the Warlpiri people had expanded their range, moving into the lands of the Anmatyerre as the latter&#x27;s population dropped.

===Joint land claim===
On 21 August 1980 a land claim was submitted by 90 claimants on behalf of the Warlpiri, Kukatja And Ngarti peoples, as traditional owners, under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976&quot;, for an area of about . It was the 11th traditional land claim presented on behalf of Aboriginal traditional owners by the Central Land Council. The land borders on areas in which each of the languages – Ngarti, Warlpiri, and Kukatja – is dominant. People from the different language groups have been influenced by each other when residing at Balgo, Western Australia and Lajamanu, Northern Territory. The claim was presented at Balgo Mission. The recommendation handed down by Justice Sir William Kearney on 23 August 1985 and presented on 19 August 1986 was that &quot;the whole of the claim area be granted to a Land Trust for the benefit of Aboriginals entitled by tradition to its use or occupation, whether or not the traditional entitlement is qualified as to place, time, circumstance, purpose or permission&quot;.

Walpiri people now manage their Country as part of the Southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area, declared in 2012.

==History of contact and study==
Mervyn Meggitt was sent by his teacher A. P. Elkin to study the Warlpiri, and he stayed with them for over 18 months from 1953 to 1958. His research into their social system, &quot;Desert People: A Study of the Walbiri Aborigines of Australia&quot;, was published in 1962. In the mid 1970s, Diane Bell undertook detailed work of the lives of Warlpiri women, summed up in her &quot;Daughters of the Dreaming&quot; (1982). Liam Campbell, in his &quot;Darby: One hundred years of life in a changing culture&quot;, (2006) recorded the autobiography of one Warlpiri man, Darby Jampijinpa Ross, a centenarian who lived through the profound changes affecting his people throughout the 20th century, including the death of family in the Coniston massacre. In 2000, the French anthropologist Françoise Dussart published a major study of the interplay of gender roles in the ritual maintenance and transmission by &quot;yampurru&quot;, holders of both sexes of the big secrets, regarding the tales and ceremonies concerning the &quot;Warrlpiri Dreaming (Jukurrpa)&quot;.

==The arts==
Warlpiri people are known for their traditional dances and have given performances at major events. Singing and dancing are also used in Warlpiri culture for turning boys into men, curing sicknesses, childbirth, attacking enemies, and ensuring fertility. The Warlpiri also have many different religious ceremonies and events where they sing and dance.

Many Indigenous artists, particularly in the Papunya Tula organisation, are of Warlpiri descent. Warnayaka Art, in Lajamanu, Northern Territory, is owned by the artists, who create works across a range of traditional and contemporary art media. A small gallery displays the art, and some of the artists have been finalists in the National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award. In the past, Warlpiri artwork was created on wood and sand. Then later, the artwork was made on the body of Warlpiri people. Today the art is used in galleries to pass down tradition and laws to the next generation of the Warlpiri people.

==Kinship==


Warlpiri people divide their relatives, and by extension the entire population, into eight named groups or &quot;subsections&quot;. These subsections are related to kinship, and determine one&#x27;s family rights and obligations. The following is a brief sketch of how the subsection system relates to genealogy.

The subsections are divided into four &quot;semi-patrimoieties&quot;, each consisting of two subsections. One always belongs to the same semi-patrimoiety as one&#x27;s father, but to the opposite subsection, so that men in a patriline will alternate between those two subsections.

The subsections are also divided into two &quot;matrimoieties&quot;, each consisting of four subsections. One always belongs to the same matrimoiety as one&#x27;s mother, and women in a matriline will cycle through the four subsections of that matrimoiety.

The two subsections in a semi-patrimoiety always belong to opposite matrimoieties, and similarly, the four subsections of each matrimoiety are distributed among the four semi-patrimoieties. Each subsection is uniquely determined by which semi-patrimoiety and which matrimoiety it belongs to.

Female lines of descent in the two matrimoieties cycle through the semi-patrimoieties &quot;in opposite directions&quot;. The result is that one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father (MFMF) is of the same subsection as oneself.

Siblings always belong to the same subsection.

It follows from these rules that one must choose one&#x27;s spouse from a particular subsection, and traditional Warlpiri disapprove of marriages that break this constraint. The correct subsection to marry from is that of one&#x27;s maternal grandfather (though of course one seeks a spouse closer to one&#x27;s own age).

The subsection system underlies all of traditional Warlpiri society, determining how Warlpiri people address and regard each other. Two members of the same subsection refer to each other as siblings, whether or not they actually have the same parent. Men in the same subsection as one&#x27;s father (for example, one&#x27;s father&#x27;s male siblings) are called &quot;father&quot;, and this practice is often followed even when Warlpiri people speak English. In the same way, most of the kinship terms in the Warlpiri language actually refer to subsection (or &quot;classificatory&quot;) relationships, not to literal genetic relationships.

Traditionally, the first thing one Warlpiri person wants to know about another is their subsection. Warlpiri people often address each other by subsection name rather than by personal name, and incorporate their subsection name into their English one, usually as a middle name. When Warlpiri people marry Europeans, they tend to extend the subsection system to their in-laws, starting with the assumption that the European spouse is of the correct subsection. Rather distant European relatives may find themselves classified as honorary uncles, nieces, grandparents, and so on. Warlpiri people will then try to make sure that further marriages with related Europeans will adhere to the marriage constraint.

The traditional taboo against familiarity between a man and his mother-in-law extends automatically to any man and woman whose subsections are those of man and mother-in-law.

The subsection system automatically prevents incest between siblings and any relatives closer than cousins. Cousins that are children of classificatory siblings (who may, by definition, also happen to be true siblings) of the same sex are themselves classificatory siblings, and may not marry; but children of classificatory siblings of the opposite sex are of the appropriate subsections for marriage, and marriage between so-called &quot;cross cousins&quot; is actually encouraged in traditional society. Where a couple are not merely classificatory cross-cousins but are true cross-cousins (i.e. their parents are actual siblings), marriage is generally frowned upon.

The eight subsections are interrelated in a pattern known in group theory as the order 8 dihedral group, D4.

If a Warlpiri person has a second choice marriage, then any children they have take on two skin names: first, the skin name they would have adopted had the marriage been first choice; second, the skin name the second choice marriage implied. When asked what their skin name is, they often reply with the former, but may also additionally use the latter. (Observation made from a discussion with a young &#x27;Japananga-Jupurulla&#x27;.)

In Warlpiri culture, widows are not forced to remarry and are a very important part of society.

== Employment ==
The Warlpiri people have had a hard time paying taxes much like other Indigenous people in Australia. The Australian Government created training programs in the early 2000s, originally to help the economy and prevent welfare-dependent Indigenous people; however, this had the effect of separating them from their culture.

Warlpiri people are known for their self-reliance and their close-knit society. They have their own radio show that not only connects the widely dispersed people, but connects them to the outside world, and allows the youth and women to have a voice.

Warlpiri people also now work with the U.S. based Newmont Mining Corporation. Newmont and the Warlpiri made a plan known as the Granites-Kurra Ten Year Plan. Because the Warlpiri people are allowing the Newmont Corporation to mine on their lands, this gives them more job opportunities. This plan also helps support Warlpiri education and strengthening governance structures.

The Walpiri Rangers, managed by the Central Land Council also manage their Country as part of the Southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area.

<text>Post-cognitivist psychology comprises varieties of psychology that have emerged since the 1990s, challenging the basic assumptions of cognitivism and information processing models of cognition, and forms one of the fields contributing to the postcognitivism movement. Important predecessors of these movements include critical psychology and humanistic psychology.

<doc id="1002984" wikidata="Q1342399" url="?curid=1002984" title="Subarctic">
<text>The subarctic zone is a region in the Northern Hemisphere immediately south of the true Arctic, north of hemiboreal regions and covering much of Alaska, Canada, Iceland, the north of Fennoscandia, Northwestern Russia, Siberia, and the Cairngorms. Generally, subarctic regions fall between 50°N and 70°N latitude, depending on local climates. Precipitation is usually low, and vegetation is characteristic of the taiga.

Daylight at these latitudes is quite extreme between summer and winter due to its high latitude. Near the summer solstice for instance, subarctic regions can experience an all-night period of either civil, nautical, or astronomical twilight (or in the northern reaches full daylight), since the sun never dips more than 18 degrees below the horizon. Noctilucent clouds are best observed within this range of latitude.

== Climate and soils ==

Subarctic temperatures are above for at least one and at most three months of the year. Precipitation tends to be low due to the low moisture content of the cold air but isn&#x27;t to the point to semiarid regions. Precipitation is typically greater in warmer months, with a summer maximum ranging from moderate in North America to extreme in the Russian Far East. Except in the wettest areas glaciers are not large because of the lack of winter precipitation; in the wettest areas, however, glaciers tend to be very abundant and Pleistocene glaciation covered even the lowest elevations. Soils of the subarctic are in which leaching of nutrients takes place even in the most heavily glaciated regions. The dominant soil orders are podsols and, further north, gelisols.

Subarctic regions are often characterized by taiga forest vegetation as deciduous trees can&#x27;t withstand the long winters, though where winters are relatively mild, as in northern Norway, broadleaf forest may occur—though in some cases soils remain too saturated almost throughout the year to sustain &quot;any&quot; tree growth and the dominant vegetation is a peaty herbland dominated by grasses and sedges. Typically, there are only a few species of large terrestrial mammals in the subarctic regions, the most important being elk, moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), bears, reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;), and wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). Agriculture is mainly limited to animal husbandry as many crops can&#x27;t be grown here, though in some areas barley can be grown. Canada and Siberia are very rich in minerals, notably nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, lead, zinc and uranium, whilst the Grand Banks and Sea of Okhotsk are two of the richest fisheries in the world and provide support for many small towns.

Except for those areas that are well-drained or adjacent to warm ocean currents, there is almost always continuous permafrost due to the very cold winters and short summers. This means that building in most subarctic regions is very difficult and expensive: cities are very few (Murmansk being the largest) and generally small, whilst roads are also few. Subarctic rail transport only exists in Europe (lines to Narvik and Murmansk) and the Norilsk–Dudinka line in northern Siberia, as well as the Alaska Railroad in Alaska and short sections of rail lines in Canada reaching northward into the lower subarctic. An important consequence is that transportation usually tends to be restricted to &quot;bush&quot; planes, helicopters and, in summer, riverboats.

==Economy==
Except for a few parts of Europe where the winters are relatively mild due to prevailing wind and ocean current patterns, subarctic regions were not explored until the 18th and 19th centuries. Even then, the difficulty of transportation ensured that few settlements (most of them are created for mining) lasted long—such as the abandoned, once-thriving cities of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and increasingly Siberia illustrate this.

The Trans-Siberian Railway, which skirts the edge of the region, provided a major boost to Russian settlement in the subarctic, as did the intensive industrialization under Joseph Stalin that relied on the enormous mineral resources of the Central Siberian Plateau. Today, many towns in subarctic Russia are declining precipitously as mines close. In Canada, after the early minerals ran out, development stalled until hydroelectric development occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Hydro-Quebec in particular has carried out many engineering works in regions of near-continuous permafrost, but these have never supported a significant population and have only mainly served densely populated southern Quebec.

Tourism in recent years has become a major source of revenue for most countries of the subarctic due to the beautiful, generally glacial landscapes so characteristic of the region. Most areas in the subarctic are among the most expensive places in the world to visit, due to both high costs of living and transportation inaccessibility. Nonetheless, the great opportunities for outdoor recreation lure an ever-increasing number of travelers. At the same time, the older industries of the subarctic (fishing, mining, hydroelectric power) are being threatened by both environmental opposition and overfishing leading to depleted stocks of commercially important species living in this region.

<doc id="1002985" wikidata="Q6697827" url="?curid=1002985" title="Lucky (Waiting for Godot)">
<text>Lucky is a character from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. He is a slave to the character Pozzo.

Lucky is unique in a play where most of the characters talk incessantly: he only utters two sentences, one of which is more than seven hundred words long (the monologue). Lucky suffers at the hands of Pozzo willingly and without hesitation. He is &quot;tied&quot; (a key theme in &quot;Godot&quot;) to Pozzo by a ridiculously long rope in the first act, and then a similarly ridiculous short rope in the second act. Both tie around his neck. When he is not serving Pozzo, he usually stands in one spot drooling, or sleeping if he stands there long enough. His props include a picnic basket, a coat, and a suitcase full of sand.

== Interpretation ==
Lucky&#x27;s place in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; has been heavily debated. Even his name is somewhat elusive. Some have marked him as &quot;lucky&quot; because he is &quot;lucky in the context of the play.&quot; He does not have to search for things to occupy his time, which is a major pastime of the other characters. Pozzo tells him what to do, he does it, and is therefore lucky because his actions are determined absolutely. Beckett asserted, however, that he is lucky because he has &quot;no expectations&quot;.

== Lucky and Vladimir ==
Lucky is often compared to Vladimir (just as Pozzo is compared to Estragon) as being the intellectual, left-brained part of his character duo (i.e. he represents one part of a larger, whole character, whose other half is represented by Pozzo). Read this way, Pozzo and Lucky are simply an extreme form of the relationship between Estragon and Vladimir (the hapless impulsive and the intellect who protects him). He philosophises, like Vladimir, and is integral to Pozzo&#x27;s survival, especially in the second act. In the second act, Lucky becomes mute. Pozzo mourns this, despite the fact that it was he who silenced Lucky in the first act.

== The monologue ==
Lucky is most famous for his speech in Act I. The monologue is prompted by Pozzo when the tramps ask him to make Lucky &quot;think&quot;. He asks them to give him his hat: when Lucky wears his hat, he is capable of thinking. The monologue is long, rambling word salad, and does not have any apparent end; it is only stopped when Vladimir takes the hat back. Within the gibberish Lucky makes comments on the arbitrary nature of God, man&#x27;s tendency to pine and fade away, and towards the end, the decaying state of the earth. His ramblings may be loosely based around the theories of the Irish philosopher Bishop Berkeley.

<text>The Alofaaga Blowholes, also known as the Taga Blowholes, are a natural feature located in the district of Palauli, south west of Salelologa wharf on the island of Savai&#x27;i in Samoa. The entrance to the blowholes is in the village of Taga.

In this area, lava flows have created a series of tubes connecting a flat clifftop of lava rock with the ocean below. Waves breaking against the lower end of the lava tubes send water at high pressure up through the tubes, creating fountains that spray every few seconds. As most of the land in Samoa is under customary ownership, the village charges a small admission for entry to view the blowholes. The area is unfenced and surrounded by wet, slippery rocks which can be dangerous. Falling into one of the blowholes would be almost certainly fatal. A track along the coast can be followed west to the ancient village of Fagaloa.

<doc id="1003003" wikidata="Q8042432" url="?curid=1003003" title="XPath 2.0">
<text>XPath 2.0 is a version of the XPath language defined by the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C. It became a recommendation on 23 January 2007. As a W3C Recommendation it was superseded by XPath 3.0 on 10 April 2014.

XPath is used primarily for selecting parts of an XML document. For this purpose the XML document is modelled as a tree of nodes. XPath allows nodes to be selected by means of a hierarchic navigation path through the document tree.

The language is significantly larger than its predecessor, XPath 1.0, and some of the basic concepts such as the data model and type system have changed. The two language versions are therefore described in separate articles.

XPath 2.0 is used as a sublanguage of XSLT 2.0, and it is also a subset of XQuery 1.0. All three languages share the same data model (the XDM), type system, and function library, and were developed together and published on the same day.

== Data model ==
Every value in XPath 2.0 is a &quot;sequence&quot; of &quot;items&quot;. The items may be &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;atomic values&quot;. An individual node or atomic value is considered to be a sequence of length one. Sequences may not be nested.

Nodes are of seven kinds, corresponding to different constructs in the syntax of XML: elements, attributes, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, namespace nodes, and document nodes. (The document node replaces the &quot;root node&quot; of XPath 1.0, because the XPath 2.0 model allows trees to be rooted at other kinds of node, notably elements.)

Nodes may be typed or untyped. A node acquires a type as a result of validation against an XML Schema. If an element or attribute is successfully validated against a particular complex type or simple type defined in a schema, the name of that type is attached as an annotation to the node, and determines the outcome of operations applied to that node: for example, when sorting, nodes that are annotated as integers will be sorted as integers.

Atomic values may belong to any of the 19 primitive types defined in the XML Schema specification (for example, string, boolean, double, float, decimal, dateTime, QName, and so on). They may also belong to a type derived from one of these primitive types: either a built-in derived type such as integer or Name, or a user-defined derived type defined in a user-written schema.

== Type system ==

The type system of XPath 2.0 is noteworthy for the fact that it mixes strong typing and weak typing within a single language.

Operations such as arithmetic and boolean comparison require atomic values as their operands. If an operand returns a node (for example, codice_1), then the node is automatically &quot;atomized&quot; to extract the atomic value. If the input document has been validated against a schema, then the node will typically have a type annotation, and this determines the type of the resulting atomic value (in this example, the codice_2 attribute might have the type codice_3). If no schema is in use, the node will be untyped, and the type of the resulting atomic value will be codice_4. Typed atomic values are checked to ensure that they have an appropriate type for the context where they are used: for example, it is not possible to multiply a date by a number. Untyped atomic values, by contrast, follow a weak typing discipline: they are automatically converted to a type appropriate to the operation where they are used: for example with an arithmetic operation an untyped atomic value is converted to the type codice_5.

== Path expressions ==

The &quot;location paths&quot; of XPath 1.0 are referred to in XPath 2.0 as &quot;path expressions&quot;. Informally, a path expression is a sequence of steps separated by the &quot;codice_6&quot; operator, for example codice_7 (which is short for codice_8). More formally, however, &quot;codice_6&quot; is simply a binary operator that applies the expression on its right-hand side to each item in turn selected by the expression on the left hand side. So in this example, the expression codice_10 selects all the element children of the context node that are named codice_11; the expression codice_12 is then applied to each of these nodes, selecting all the codice_13 children of the codice_11 elements; and the expression codice_15 is then applied to each node in this sequence, which selects all the codice_16 children of these codice_13 elements.

The &quot;codice_6&quot; operator is generalized in XPath 2.0 to allow any kind of expression to be used as an operand: in XPath 1.0, the right-hand side was always an axis step. For example, a function call can be used on the right-hand side. The typing rules for the operator require that the result of the first operand is a sequence of nodes. The right hand operand can return either nodes or atomic values (but not a mixture). If the result consists of nodes, then duplicates are eliminated and the nodes are returned in &quot;document order&quot;, an ordering defined in terms of the relative positions of the nodes in the original XML tree.

In many cases the operands of &quot;codice_6&quot; will be axis steps: these are largely unchanged from XPath 1.0, and are described in the article on XPath 1.0.

== Other operators ==

Other operators available in XPath 2.0 include the following:

Conditional expressions may be written using the syntax .

XPath 2.0 also offers a codice_20 expression, which is a small subset of the FLWOR expression from XQuery. The expression evaluates the expression codice_21 for each value in the result of expression codice_22 in turn, referring to that value using the variable reference codice_23.

== Function library ==

The function library in XPath 2.0 is greatly extended from the function library in XPath 1.0. (Bold items are available in XPath 1.0)

The functions available include the following:

== Backwards compatibility ==

Because of the changes in the data model and type system, not all expressions have exactly the same effect in XPath 2.0 as in 1.0. The main difference is that XPath 1.0 was more relaxed about type conversion, for example comparing two strings (codice_24) was quite possible but would do a numeric comparison; in XPath 2.0 this is defined to compare the two values as strings using a context-defined collating sequence.

To ease transition, XPath 2.0 defines a mode of execution in which the semantics are modified to be as close as possible to XPath 1.0 behavior. When using XSLT 2.0, this mode is activated by setting codice_25 as an attribute on the codice_26 element. This still doesn&#x27;t offer 100% compatibility, but any remaining differences are only likely to be encountered in unusual cases.

==Support==

Support for XPath 2.0 is still limited.

<doc id="1003005" wikidata="Q4438875" url="?curid=1003005" title="Reference (C++)">
<text>In the C++ programming language, a reference is a simple reference datatype that is less powerful but safer than the pointer type inherited from C. The name &quot;C++ reference&quot; may cause confusion, as in computer science a reference is a general concept datatype, with &quot;pointers&quot; and &quot;C++ references&quot; being specific reference datatype implementations. The definition of a reference in C++ is such that it does not need to exist. It can be implemented as a new name for an existing object (similar to rename keyword in Ada).

== Syntax and terminology ==
The declaration of the form:

 &lt;Type&gt;&amp; &lt;Name&gt;

where codice_1 is a type and codice_2 is an identifier is said to define an identifier whose type is lvalue reference to codice_1.

Examples:

int a = 5;
int&amp; r_a = a;

extern int&amp; r_b;
Here, codice_4 and codice_5 are of type &quot;lvalue reference to codice_6&quot;

int&amp; Foo();

codice_7 is a function that returns an &quot;lvalue reference to codice_6&quot;

void Bar(int&amp; r_p);

codice_9 is a function with a reference parameter, which is an &quot;lvalue reference to codice_6&quot;

class MyClass { int&amp; m_b; /* ... */ };

codice_11 is a codice_12 with a member which is lvalue reference to codice_6
int FuncX() { return 42 ; };
int (&amp;f_func)() = FuncX;
int (&amp;&amp;f_func2)() = FuncX; // essentially equivalent to the above
codice_14 is a function that returns a (non-reference type) codice_6 and codice_16 is an &quot;alias&quot; for codice_14

const int&amp; ref = 65;

codice_18 is an lvalue reference to codice_19 pointing to a piece of storage having value 65.
int arr[3];
int (&amp;arr_lvr)[3] = arr;
int (&amp;&amp;arr_rvr)[3] = std::move(arr);
typedef int arr_t[3];
int (&amp;&amp;arr_prvl)[3] = arr_t{}; // arr_t{} is an array prvalue
int *const &amp; ptr_clv = arr; // same as int *const &amp; ptr_clv = &amp;arr[0];
int *&amp;&amp; ptr_rv = arr;
// int *&amp;arr_lv = arr; // Error: Initializing an lvalue reference to non-const type with an rvalue
codice_20 is a reference to an array. When initializing a reference to array, array-to-pointer conversion does not take place, but it does take place when initializing a reference to pointer. Since array-to-pointer conversion returns a prvalue, only lvalue references to codice_21 and rvalue references can be initialized with its result. Similarly, when initializing a reference to function, function-to-pointer conversion does not take place (see codice_16 above), but it does take place when initializing a reference to function pointer:
int FuncX() { return 42 ; };
int (*const &amp;pf_func)() = FuncX; // same as int (*const &amp;pf_func)() = &amp;FuncX;
int (* &amp;&amp;pf_func2)() = FuncX;
The declaration of the form:

 &lt;Type&gt;&amp;&amp; &lt;Name&gt;

where codice_1 is a type and codice_2 is an identifier is said to define an identifier whose type is rvalue reference to codice_1. 
Since the name of an rvalue reference is itself an lvalue, codice_26 must be used to pass an rvalue reference to a function overload accepting an rvalue reference parameter. Rvalue references to cv-unqualified type template parameters of that same function template or codice_27 except when deduced from a brace-enclosed initializer list are called forwarding references (referred to as &quot;universal references&quot; in some older sources) and can act as lvalue or rvalue references depending on what is passed to them.
When found in function parameters, they are sometimes used with codice_28 to forward the function argument to another function while preserving the value category (lvalue or rvalue) it had when passed to the calling function.

Types which are of kind &quot;reference to codice_1&quot; are sometimes called reference types. Identifiers which are of reference type are called reference variables. To call them &quot;variable&quot;, however, is in fact a misnomer, as we will see.

References are not objects and references can only refer to object or function types. Arrays of references, pointers to references and references to references are not allowed because they require object types. , and will cause compilation errors (while (reference of array) and (reference of pointer) will not assuming they are initialized). References to codice_30 are also ill-formed because codice_30 is not an object or function type, but references to codice_32 can exist.

Declaring references as const or volatile() also fails unless a typedef/decltype is used in which case the const/volatile is ignored. However, if template argument deduction takes place and a reference type is deduced (which happens when forwarding references are used and an lvalue is passed to the function) or if codice_33, codice_34 or codice_35 denote a reference type it is possible to take a reference to that type. In that case the rule that is used to determine the type of reference is called reference collapsing and works like this: Assuming a type codice_36 and a reference type to codice_36 codice_38, attempting to create an rvalue reference to codice_38 creates a codice_38 while an lvalue reference to codice_38 creates an lvalue reference to codice_36. In other words, lvalue references override rvalue references and rvalue references of rvalue references stay unchanged.

int i;
typedef int&amp; LRI;
using RRI = int&amp;&amp;;

LRI&amp; r1 = i; // r1 has the type int&amp;
const LRI&amp; r2 = i; // r2 has the type int&amp;
const LRI&amp;&amp; r3 = i; // r3 has the type int&amp;

RRI&amp; r4 = i; // r4 has the type int&amp;
RRI&amp;&amp; r5 = 5; // r5 has the type int&amp;&amp;

decltype(r2)&amp; r6 = i; // r6 has the type int&amp;
decltype(r2)&amp;&amp; r7 = i; // r7 has the type int&amp;

A non-static member function can be declared with a ref qualifier. This qualifier participates in overload resolution and applies to the implicit object parameter like codice_21 and codice_44 but unlike those two, it does not change the properties of codice_45. What it does is mandate that the function be called on an lvalue or rvalue instance of the class.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct A
 A() = default;
 void Print()const&amp; { std::cout « &quot;lvalue\n&quot;; }
 void Print()const&amp;&amp; { std::cout « &quot;rvalue\n&quot;; }

int main()
 A a;
 a.Print(); // prints &quot;lvalue&quot;
 std::move(a).Print(); // prints &quot;rvalue&quot;
 A().Print(); // prints &quot;rvalue&quot;
 A&amp;&amp; b = std::move(a);
 b.Print(); // prints &quot;lvalue&quot;(!)


== Relationship to pointers ==
C++ references differ from pointers in several essential ways:
* A reference itself is not an object, it is an alias; any occurrence of its name refers directly to the object it references. A pointer declaration creates a pointer object which is distinct from the object the pointer refers to.
** Containers of references are not allowed because references are not objects, while containers of pointers are commonplace for polymorphism.
** It is not allowed to create a reference of reference, because references can only refer to objects (or functions).
* References cannot be uninitialized. Because it is impossible to reinitialize a reference, they must be initialized as soon as they are created. In * Once a reference is created, it cannot be later made to reference another object; it cannot be &quot;reseated&quot;. This is often done with pointers.
* References cannot be &quot;null&quot;, whereas pointers can; every reference refers to some object, although it may or may not be valid. 
particular, local and global variables must be initialized where they are defined, and references which are data members of class instances must be initialized in the initializer list of the class&#x27;s constructor. For example:
int&amp; k; // compiler will complain: error: `k&#x27; declared as reference but not initialized

There is a simple conversion between pointers and references: the address-of operator (codice_46) will yield a pointer referring to the same object when applied to a reference, and a reference which is initialized from the dereference (codice_47) of a pointer value will refer to the same object as that pointer, where this is possible without invoking undefined behavior. This equivalence is a reflection of the typical implementation, which effectively compiles references into pointers which are implicitly dereferenced at each use. Though that is usually the case, the C++ Standard does not force compilers to implement references using pointers.

A consequence of this is that in many implementations, operating on a variable with automatic or static lifetime through a reference, although syntactically similar to accessing it directly, can involve hidden dereference operations that are costly.

Also, because the operations on references are so limited, they are much easier to understand than pointers and are more resistant to errors. While pointers can be made invalid through a variety of mechanisms, ranging from carrying a null value to out-of-bounds arithmetic to illegal casts to producing them from arbitrary integers, a previously valid reference only becomes invalid in two cases:
* If it refers to an object with automatic allocation which goes out of scope,
* If it refers to an object inside a block of dynamic memory which has been freed.
The first is easy to detect automatically if the reference has static scoping, but is still a problem if the reference is a member of a dynamically allocated object; the second is more difficult to detect. These are the only concerns with references, and are suitably addressed by a reasonable allocation policy.

== Uses of references ==
* Other than just a helpful replacement for pointers, one convenient application of references is in function parameter lists, where they allow passing of parameters used for output with no explicit address-taking by the caller. For example:

void Square(int x, int&amp; out_result) {
 out_result = x * x;


Then, the following call would place 9 in &quot;y&quot;:

int y;
Square(3, y);
However, the following call would give a compiler error, since lvalue reference parameters not qualified with codice_21 can only be bound to addressable values:
Square(3, 6);

* Returning an lvalue reference allows function calls to be assigned to:
int&amp; Preinc(int&amp; x) {
 return ++x; // &quot;return x++;&quot; would have been wrong

Preinc(y) = 5; // same as ++y, y = 5
* In many implementations, normal parameter-passing mechanisms often imply an expensive copy operation for large parameters. References qualified with codice_21 are a useful way of passing large objects between functions that avoids this overhead:
void FSlow(BigObject x) { /* ... */ } 
void FFast(const BigObject&amp; x) { /* ... */ }

BigObject y;

FSlow(y); // Slow, copies y to parameter x.
FFast(y); // Fast, gives direct read-only access to y.

If codice_50 actually requires its own copy of &quot;x&quot; that it can modify, it must create a copy explicitly. While the same technique could be applied using pointers, this would involve modifying every call site of the function to add cumbersome address-of (codice_46) operators to the argument, and would be equally difficult to undo, if the object became smaller later on.

== Polymorphic behavior ==
Continuing the relationship between references and pointers (in C++ context), the former exhibit polymorphic capabilities, as one might expect:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class A {
 public:
 A() = default;
 virtual void Print() { std::cout « &quot;This is class A\n&quot;; }

class B : public A {
 public:
 B() = default;
 virtual void Print() { std::cout « &quot;This is class B\n&quot;; }

int main() {
 A a;
 A&amp; ref_to_a = a;

 B b;
 A&amp; ref_to_b = b;

 ref_to_a.Print();
 ref_to_b.Print();

The source above is valid C++ and generates the following output: 

This is class A

This is class B

<text>Paul Anthony Elliott Bew, Baron Bew (born 22 January 1950), is a British historian from Northern Ireland and a life peer. He has worked at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast since 1979, and is currently Professor of Irish Politics, a position he has held since 1991.

==Early life and education==
Bew was born on 22 January 1950 in Belfast. He was educated at Brackenber House School, and Campbell College, a grammar school in Belfast. He studied for his BA and PhD at Pembroke College, Cambridge. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;The Politics of the Irish Land War, 1879-1882&quot;.

==Academic career==
His first book, &quot;Land and the National Question in Ireland, 1858–82&quot; was a revisionist study that challenged nationalist historiography by examining the clash between landowners and tenants as well as the conflict between large and small tenants. His third book, a short study of Charles Stewart Parnell published in 1980, challenged some of the arguments of the award-winning 1977 biography of Parnell by F. S. L. Lyons, though Lyons, one of the &quot;doyens&quot; of modern Irish history, acknowledged the younger historian&#x27;s arguments by stating that &quot;Nothing Dr Bew writes is without interest.&quot; Bew&#x27;s central thesis was that Parnell was a fundamentally conservative figure whose ultimate aim was to secure a continuing position of leadership for the Protestant gentry in a Home Rule Ireland.

In 2007, Oxford University Press published Bew&#x27;s &quot;Ireland: The Politics of Enmity 1789–2006&quot;, which forms part of the &quot;Oxford History of Modern Europe&quot; series. The book received positive reviews.

Bew acted as a historical advisor to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry between 1998 and 2001.

Bew was also involved in the Belfast Project, a Boston College initiative to record interviews with former participants in the Troubles, including former republican and loyalist paramilitaries. In 2014, Gerry Adams criticised Bew&#x27;s handling of the Boston College project, as well as the journalist Ed Moloney and the former IRA volunteer Anthony McIntyre. Adams claimed Bew had deliberately chosen Moloney and McIntyre because they were unsympathetic to Adams. Bew expressed regret over the closure of the project, and stated further oral history projects of the Troubles were now &quot;under a cloud&quot;.

==Political involvement==
Bew&#x27;s political stance has changed over the years. In a 2004 interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he stated that &quot;While my language was more obviously leftwing in the 1970s than today, that sympathy has always been there&quot;. As a young man, Bew participated in the People&#x27;s Democracy marches. Bew was briefly a member of a group called the British and Irish Communist Organisation, which advocated the two nations theory of Northern Ireland. Bew was also a member of the Workers&#x27; Party, then known as Official Sinn Féin.

From 1991 to 1993, he served as President of The Irish Association for Cultural, Economic and Social Relations.

Bew is a unionist, and in 2019 called for the British government to do more to champion the union and recommended introducing a Department of the Union. He served as an &quot;informal adviser&quot; to David Trimble. Trimble and Bew are both signatories to the statement of principles of the Henry Jackson Society, which has been characterised as a neoconservative organisation.

===House of Lords===
In 2007, Bew was selected by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission to be made a member of the House of Lords. His contributions to the Good Friday Agreement process were acknowledged with an appointment. He was created Baron Bew, &quot;of Donegore in the County of Antrim&quot; on 26 March 2007, and sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. He was introduced to the Lords on 15 May 2007, supported by Baroness O&#x27;Neill of Bengarve (a fellow academic and crossbencher) and Lord Trimble (i.e. his friend David Trimble). He made his maiden speech on 23 July 2007 during a debate on political donations in Northern Ireland.

Lord Bew was Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, an advisory non-departmental public body of the United Kingdom Government, from September 2013 to August 2018. In October 2018, he was appointed as Chairman of the House of Lords Appointments Commission for a five-year term starting on 1 November 2018. He was succeeded by Baroness Deech on 26 October 2023.

==Personal life==
Bew is married to Greta Jones, a history professor at the University of Ulster, with whom he has one son, John Bew, who is professor of history at the Department of War Studies, King&#x27;s College London.

<doc id="1003019" wikidata="Q1053299" url="?curid=1003019" title="CRH plc">
<text>CRH plc is an international group of diversified building materials businesses whose headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. It manufactures and supplies a wide range of products for the construction industry. The group was formed through a 1970 merger of two leading Irish public companies, Cement Limited (established in 1936) and Roadstone Limited (1949). CRH&#x27;s primary listing is on the New York Stock Exchange since 2023, prior to which it was on the London Stock Exchange and on Euronext Dublin (where it was a constituent of the ISEQ 20).

==History==
===1970–1980s: formation and listings===
The company&#x27;s name is an abbreviation of Cement Roadstone Holdings, and was formed through the merger in 1970 of &quot;Cement Ltd&quot; (established in 1936) and &quot; Roadstone Ltd&quot; (established in 1949). According to Jonathan Guthrie of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, it is pronounced &quot;Cee Orr Haitch&quot;. The company went public on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1973.

CRH entered the United States in 1978 by buying Amcor, a concrete products group in Utah which would then form the basis of the company&#x27;s U.S. division, which is now called Oldcastle Inc. Subsequent large purchases in the US included Callanan Industries, a New York State based aggregates and asphalt producer in 1985.

===1990s: early Europe and US acquisitions===
In the 1990s the company moved into France with a number of buys including Raboni SA, a builders merchant company and drainage systems and concrete vault manufacturing group Prefaest SA.

In 1995, CRH made its first entry into new or emerging markets when it bought Holding Cement Polski, which later gained majority control of Cementownia Ożarów, one of the Poland&#x27;s major cement producers. That acquisition marked the first CRH cement manufacturing operation outside Ireland. By the end of the decade, CRH numbered more than a dozen operations in Poland and it has since invested in cement production in neighbouring Ukraine, most recently with the announcement of an agreement to buy Mykolaiv Cement from rival Lafarge. In 1999 CRH bought Finnsementti Oy, Finland&#x27;s only cement producer, and Lohja Rudus Oy, Finland&#x27;s top producer of aggregates and ready-mix concrete.
In the 1990s, US acquisitions by CRH included Betco Block &amp; Products Inc. of Bethesda, Maryland in 1990. CRH acquired Balf Co. in Connecticut, Lebanon Rock in Pennsylvania, Keating in Massachusetts and Sullivan Lafarge in New York state in 1994. It acquired Allied Building Products, which specialized in roofing and cladding products and Tilcon, a major road construction specialist in the Northeast United States in 1996.

===2000–2010: later acquisitions===

The company entered Switzerland in 2000 with the EUR 425 million purchase of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, as well as a regional distribution network. In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav. In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a do-it-yourself store chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands. In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce.
In the United States, CRH acquired Ohio&#x27;s Shelly Group in 2000, and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002 and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company&#x27;s largest deal. In 2007 CRH purchased four companies worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc. (CYDI), Eugene Sand &amp; Gravel, Cessford Construction and McMinn&#x27;s Asphalt and Prospect Agrregates. Also in 2008, CRH agreed to purchase a landscape paver, Pavestone, for $540 million.

In 2006 CRH invested in a cement factory based in the Heilongjiang region in China. It has built on that presence acquiring a 26% stake in the Jilin Yatai Group and an option to acquire 49% in the future. In 2008 CRH agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Indian cement company My Home Industries Ltd. for €290 million ($452 million).

===2011–2019: Americas, Europe and emerging markets===

CRH confirmed in 2013 that it was interested in looking at other opportunities in India. In 2015, CRH remained listed in both London and Dublin. In February 2015, CRH agreed to purchase the UK building materials producer Lafarge Tarmac. In 2015, CRH purchased US$6.5 billion of assets from the newly formed company LafargeHolcim. The acquisition almost tripled CRH&#x27;s net debt, bringing it to €6.6 billion. The LafargeHolcim acquisition made CRH &quot;the world’s third-largest building materials group by market value.&quot; A week after CEO Albert Manifold announced that CRH was looking for large-scale acquisitions, in August 2015, CRH paid $1.3 billion for CR Laurence, a glazing company based in California. At the time, CRH already had a similar business in North America called BuildingEnvelope, with 4,500 employees, which it said it would integrate with CRH. By November 2015, CRH was getting about a fifth of its operating earnings from US infrastructure.

In June 2016, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that CRH earned twice as much profit from the Americas versus Europe. As of November 2016, half the asphalt, aggregates and assorted material it sold went to the United States. Headquartered in Dublin, CRH was the biggest producer of asphalt in the US and the third largest producer of ready-mixed concrete. Sales for 2016 were €27.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. Profit after tax was €1.3 billion. In April 2017, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; noted that chief executive Albert Manifold&#x27;s package almost doubled in 2016 to €10 million, despite disagreement among shareholders the year before on pay. As of 27 April 2017, CRH was Ireland&#x27;s biggest company. Chief executive was Albert Manifold. That quarter, sales were up in its three divisions in Europe, while the Americas materials unit had higher sales as well. At the time, it did 65 percent of its business in the Americas, while the market in the Philippines proving to be &quot;challenging,&quot; and weighing down performance in Asia. On 27 April 2017, CRH held their annual general meeting in Dublin, at which point 17 percent of shareholders voted against the company&#x27;s executive pay structure. The year prior, 40 percent had voted against. At the meeting, chairman Nick Hartery noted that share price in the company had increased 80 percent since 2014. Also in April 2017, it was reported that CRH was expecting to make a large-scale acquisition in 2018. At the time, over the earlier part of the year CRH had spent €500 million on eight acquisitions. In early May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in CRH plc. Also in 2017, CRH sold Allied Building Products to Beacon Roofing Supply for $2.6 billion. By the end of 2017, the biggest acquisition was Fels-Werke GmbH, a German leading lime and aggregates business with 1 billion tonnes of high-quality limestone reserves, 11 production locations, nine in Germany and one in both the Czech Republic and Russia.

In 2018, CRH purchased Ash Grove Cement.

In July 2019, CRH announced that it was selling its underperforming European distribution arm to Blackstone, a US investment firm, for €1.64 billion.

In June 2023, after a shareholder vote, CRH confirmed it was moving its primary stock listing from London to the New York Stock Exchange.

In January 2025, Jim Mintern assumed the role of CEO at the company.

==Financial performance==
The following is a summary of financial data:
==Controversy==

===Cartel accusations===

====Poland====
In Poland in 2007, CRH was fined €530,000 by the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for interfering with evidence that Polish authorities were gathering for a price-fixing investigation. In 2009, Grupa Ożarów (in which CRH first invested in 1995) was fined €26 million for operating a price fixing cartel in Poland. The Polish Competition Regulator stated that seven companies, which accounted for almost 100 per cent of the market, had fixed minimum prices for grey cement and agreed on a market share for each operator. CRH has stated its belief that Ozarów operated an independent commercial policy in Poland and the fine was appealed.

====Ireland====
In Ireland in 1994, Irish Cement Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRH, was determined by the European Commission to be part of price fixing and market sharing cartel across Europe which it said had illegally and artificially inflated the price of cement throughout the continent. A fine of over €3.5 million was levied. In Ireland in 1996, High Court proceedings were initiated against CRH, its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused CRH and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anti-competitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business. In 2012, CRH applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the &quot;inordinate and inexcusable delay&quot; in bringing forward any evidence in the case. That judgement was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2012. At the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in CRH and was forced to stand down. As of 2012, the Irish cement and concrete industry at large was under investigation by the Irish Competition Authority.

====United States====
In 2006, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in California against CRH subsidiary Oldcastle Precast and three AT&amp;T affiliates. The defendants were alleged to have unreasonably restrained trade and conspired to monopolize telephone vaults for land-line connections. Plaintiffs challenged a contract requiring developers to purchase Oldcastle Precast product for properties served by AT&amp;T infrastructure. They contended the arrangement led to Oldcastle Precast capturing northern California sales of precast electrical vaults, which were often placed concurrently with telephone structures. In 2010, an American Court of Appeal ruled that the plaintiff&#x27;s counsel had failed to provide enough evidence to show that the defendants harmed competition in California and Nevada telephone vault markets.

In October 2009, a cement and concrete price fixing class action lawsuit was filed in Florida against Oldcastle Materials and others. The claim alleged that the defendants eliminated competition in the market for cement and concrete by charging artificially high prices from at least the period 2000 to 2009. The claim further alleged that the conspiracy was facilitated through in-personal meetings, telephone conversations and other communications. In 2008 the defendants announced uniform price increases for concrete and cement, bringing their prices to the same level at the same time, the lawsuit claimed. Then in September a number of defendant companies cut the price of concrete in an effort to lure customers away from independently owned concrete firms. The lawsuit stated that the practices alleged in the cement and concrete industry were clearly illegal. In 2012, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.

April 2014, &quot;ridiculously dangerous&quot; was the description applied to an Oldcastle Materials construction zone in Cleveland, Ohio in a wrongful death lawsuit regarding the death of Randy Roginski on 27 July 2010. The family of the deceased was awarded $19 million in compensation and the CRH-related Shelly Company was levied $20 million in punitive damages.

===Other allegations===

====Poland====
In 2005, a Polish businessman, Marek Dochnal, alleged to a Polish Parliamentary Inquiry that he had arranged a bribe of almost $1 million for CRH to a former minister for privatisation, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, in connection with the privatisation of a cement plant at Ozarow, in central Poland, in 1995. CRH, which now owns and operates the cement plant at Ozarow, said the allegations were &quot;without foundation&quot;.

It was also revealed in 2005, that CRH contributed €125,000 to a charity founded by the wife of Poland&#x27;s president, Jolanta Kwasniewska. Both CRH and the Polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction.

====Ireland====
In 2003, CRH was accused of making payments to Ireland&#x27;s former Taoiseach Charles Haughey as details emerged of how Haughey received payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours. In 1969, Roadstone Ltd (CRH) sold 80 acres of land to Haughey, the then Minister of Finance, for £120,000. In 1973, Haughey sold 17.5 acres of that land back to CRH for £140,000. Within four years, Haughey had made a net profit of £20,000 and 62.5 acres at CRH&#x27;s expense. Charles Haughey was offered chairmanship of CRH in 1972.

====Ansbacher Bank====
The existence of illegal offshore accounts first emerged in 1997 during the McCracken Tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry.

The bank was founded in the 1970s and was being run by Des Traynor who was chairman of CRH from 1989 to 1994 and who ran his bank during that period out of CRH&#x27;s registered office in Dublin&#x27;s Fitzwilliam Square where the company provided an office for its chairman. Traynor was also personal financier to Charles Haughey.

During the investigation it materialised that Justice Moriarty held approximately £500,000 in CRH shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning CRH he was not, he said, precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from Des Traynor&#x27;s offices at Fitzwilliam Square. Criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing Moriarty given his shareholding.

In 1999, as evidence on the scale of the Ansbacher accounts grew Tánaiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) and PD Minister Mary Harney asked the High Court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders.

The High Court Inspectors&#x27; report was published in 2002. It found that eight out of fifteen CRH directors held Ansbacher accounts, including four former chairmen. It also concluded (Chapter 15, p. 189) that &quot;CRH as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of Ansbacher’s activities in Ireland&quot;.

After the publication of the report CRH acknowledged publicly that its then Chairman had &quot;misused its facilities and personnel&quot; which &quot;represented a grave breach of trust by Mr Traynor&quot;.

====Sale of Glen Ding Lands====
In 1998, Dáil Éireann (Ireland&#x27;s Parliament) voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £48 million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to Roadstone, a subsidiary company of CRH, without public tender for £1.25 million in 1991.

Many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale, Charles Haughey was Taoiseach and his financier Des Traynor was Chairman of CRH. Dáil Éireann voted not to investigate whether CRH had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of Glen Ding.

The State&#x27;s Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell &quot;far short of&quot; the Roadstone offer and that &quot;The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State&quot; (Section 9.6). It also noted &quot;even though it is unlikely that the Roadstone offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business&quot;. It was noted by the Department&#x27;s Accounting Officer that the Roadstone offer &quot;was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received&quot;, that another bidder &quot;was afforded every opportunity&quot; to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues. &quot;In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional&quot;.

The Glen Ding transaction was further investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal which in 2006 reported its conclusion &quot;that there was no connection, directly or indirectly, between Mr Charles Haughey and any aspect of this disposal, nor any connection between the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal.&quot;

====Public criticism====
In 2005, opposition TD (Teachta Dála - Irish member of parliament) Phil Hogan, who later became Minister for Environment (2011 - ), stated in Dáil Éireann that &quot;there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy... In the case of CRH, profits have been extracted from the Irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anti-competitive and anti-consumer. The European Court of First Instance and finally the European Court of Justice have upheld findings of serious anti-competitive behaviour against CRH and other. While Sweden, Finland, UK, France and Germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry, Ireland’s answer has been a stony silence.&quot;

In 2011 TD Shane Ross, a repeated critic of CRH as a journalist stated that CRH &quot;disturbs&quot; him and questioned why there had been no investigation of CRH in Ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere.

<text>Pierre Coudrin, SSCC (1 March 1768 – 1837) was a French religious priest. He was the founder of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, a religious institute in the Roman Catholic Church known for its missionary work in Hawaii, Africa, Europe, Central America and the Pacific Islands.

==Life==
Marie-Joseph-Pierre Coudrin was born on 1 March 1768, at Coussay-les-Bois, near Poitiers. His parents were farmers. His uncle was a parish priest in a neighboring village. Pierre spent his vacations with him during the years of his primary education, and his uncle prepared him for first communion. He completed his secondary studies in 1785 at Châtellerault, and at 17 years of age, entered the University of Poitiers.

He was only a deacon when the persecution, directed against the clergy, dispersed the students of the seminary of Poitiers, where he was being trained. Having learned that de Bonal, the Bishop of Clermont, was in Paris and would ordain him to priesthood, Coudrin set out for that city, and on 4 March 1792, was ordained in the Irish Seminary just as France was becoming embroiled in the Revolution. The ordination took place secretly in the library, because the revolutionaries had seized the chapel to hold their meetings.

==Vision==
After ordination he returned to Coursay, but the violence of the persecution soon compelled him to go into hiding. Coudrin hid in an attic of the granary of the Chateau d&#x27;Usseau where he remained for six months. He reported that, during this time, he awoke one evening surrounded by an apparition of priests, brothers and nuns illuminated in albs. He took the vision to be a divine calling to establish a religious institute that would become the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Coudrin quickly left the granary and traveled to Poitiers to begin an underground ministry, waiting for the right moment to start his group. During October of the same year, he also labored disguised in the Diocese of Tours.

During his underground ministry in 1794, Coudrin met Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie, a young aristocrat. She and her mother had been imprisoned for a time, accused of hiding a priest. She told Coudrin of a heaven-sent vision she had while in prison calling her to service to God. Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie shared with each other their visions of creating a religious institute in the midst of danger for Roman Catholics in France.

==Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary==
Coudrin gathered around him a few companions, to whom he communicated his views to promote devotion to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and of Mary, and who were also willing to assist him in his great work. On October 20, 1800 Henriette made her first vows with four companions. On Christmas night, 1800, Coudrin made his solemn vows, devoting himself entirely &quot;to the love of the Sacred Hearts&quot;.

During the year 1805 Coudrin bought some dilapidated houses in the Rue Picpus in Paris, and there established himself with a few of his confreres. A college for the training of youths and a seminary were soon started. &quot;The good Father&quot;, as his confreres used to call him, governed the congregation with tact and prudence, and inspite of many difficulties, his work prospered. Several new convents and colleges were founded and opened in various towns. Pope Pius VII approved the congregation in 1817 with the bull &quot;Pastor aeternus&quot;. The institute was composed of two branches of religious, one for men and the other for women.

In 1826, Coudrin was appointed vicar general of Gustave Maximilien Juste de Croÿ-Solre, Archbishop of Rouen. In 1829, he accompanied de Croy to Rome for the 1829 conclave.

The original members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary founded new schools for poor children, seminaries to train the priesthood of the institute and parish missions throughout Europe. At the time of Coudrin&#x27;s death in 1837, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary had 276 fathers and brothers and 1125 sisters.

In 2016, there were over 1500 in the congregation made up of priests, brothers and sisters and an increasing number of lay associate members in over 30 countries.

== Beatification process ==
The beatification process on Coudrin was opened in February 1925 and received the &quot;nihil obstat&quot; in April 1995. Coudrin&#x27;s spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 12 March 1930. and again in 1952. The postulator of the cause is Andrzej Łukawski, SSCC.

<text>Salelologa is a village district at the east end of Savai&#x27;i island in Samoa. It is the main entry point into the island with the only ferry terminal on Savai&#x27;i. It also serves as the main township for shopping and public amenities with a market selling fresh produce and arts and crafts.

Salelologa is made up of smaller sub-villages &quot;pito nu&#x27;u&quot; and falls within the electoral district of Fa&#x27;asaleleaga.

==Township==
The township consists of one main shopping street. Fresh fish, locally grown produce and arts and crafts are sold at the Salelologa Market (&quot;makeki&quot;) which was recently moved to a new site by the wharf in 2009. The market is open six days a week, Monday to Saturday. Most shops and markets in Samoa close on Sundays with a few small outlets opening in the late afternoon. There are also several small supermarkets, a wholesaler, petrol stations, bakeries such as Retzlaff&#x27;s bakery, budget hotels and accommodation, as well as public amenities such as internet access, banks and Western Union money transfer outlets.

==Transport==
The main island highway which reaches most parts of Savai&#x27;i is tar-sealed and well maintained. Salelologa is the only township on Savai&#x27;i and is the main destination for arrivals and departures for local public transport and visitors to the island.

===Ferry terminal===

Salelologa wharf is the main port of entry into the island and is the only ferry terminal on Savai&#x27;i. The inter-island passenger and vehicle ferries operate in the Apolima Strait between Salelologa and Mulifanua wharf at the north west corner of Upolu. The ferries are managed by the government and operate seven days a week during the day. Ferry arrivals and departures are usually every two hours. A one-way trip takes about 90 minutes with views of Apolima and Manono islands to the south during the crossing.

===Maota Airport===
Maota Airport is an airstrip 10 minutes south of Salelologa. Most flights operate between Faleolo International Airport on Upolu; however, the service can be sporadic.

===Local transport===
There are buses, taxis and rental car companies at the ferry terminal and in the township. The bus route is via the main highway which generally follows the coastline of the island where most villages and settlements are situated. The buses are usually scheduled around the ferry arrivals and departures with short stops at the market and shops before heading out of town. There are no &#x27;bus stop&#x27; signs on Savai&#x27;i and catching a bus involves standing by the side of the road or signalling with a wave at the driver. Local buses are the cheapest form of transport on the island, although they can fill very quickly at the ferry terminal. There are plenty of taxis at the wharf and around the township during the day. Rental cars are available on Savai&#x27;i, although prior bookings are essential.

==Public library==
Savai&#x27;i Public Library, the only public library on the island, is situated in Salelologa by the old market. It is sometimes referred to as Salelologa Library. It is the only branch of Samoa&#x27;s central Nelson Memorial Public Library in the capital Apia on Upolu island.

<text>Java 3D is a scene graph-based 3D application programming interface (API) for the Java platform. It runs on top of either OpenGL or Direct3D until version 1.6.0, which runs on top of Java OpenGL (JOGL). Since version 1.2, Java 3D has been developed under the Java Community Process. A Java 3D scene graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Compared to other solutions, Java 3D is not only a wrapper around these graphics APIs, but an interface that encapsulates the graphics programming using a true object-oriented approach. Here a scene is constructed using a scene graph that is a representation of the objects that have to be shown. This scene graph is structured as a tree containing several elements that are necessary to display the objects. Additionally, Java 3D offers extensive spatialized sound support.

Java 3D and its documentation are available for download separately. They are not part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

==History==
Intel, Silicon Graphics, Apple, and Sun all had retained mode scene graph APIs under development in 1996. Since they all wanted to make a Java version, they decided to collaborate in making it. That project became Java 3D. Development was underway already in 1997. A public beta version was released in March 1998. The first version was released in December 1998. From mid-2003 through summer 2004, the development of Java 3D was discontinued. In the summer of 2004, Java 3D was released as a community source project, and Sun and volunteers have since been continuing its development.

On January 29, 2008, it was announced that improvements to Java 3D would be put on hold to produce a 3D scene graph for JavaFX JavaFX with 3D support was eventually released with Java 8. The JavaFX 3D graphics functionality has more or less come to supersede Java 3D.

Since February 28, 2008, the entire Java 3D source code is released under the GPL version 2 license with GPL linking exception.

Since February 10, 2012, Java 3D uses JOGL 2.0 for its hardware accelerated OpenGL rendering. The port was initiated by Julien Gouesse.

==Features==

*Multithreaded scene graph structure
*Cross-platform
*Generic real-time API, usable for both visualization and gaming
*Support for retained, compiled-retained, and immediate mode rendering
*Includes hardware-accelerated JOGL, OpenGL, and Direct3D renderers (depending on platform)
*Sophisticated virtual-reality-based view model with support for stereoscopic rendering and complex multi-display configurations
*Native support for head-mounted display
*CAVE (multiple screen projectors)
*3D spatial sound
*Programmable shaders, supporting both GLSL and CG
*Stencil buffer
*Importers for most mainstream formats, like 3DS, OBJ, VRML, X3D, NWN, and FLT

==Competing technologies==
Java 3D is not the only high-level API option to render 3D in Java. In part due to the pause in development during 2003 and 2004, several competing Java scene graph technologies emerged:

General purpose:
*Ardor3D
*JavaFX

Gaming:
*jMonkeyEngine
*Espresso3D

Visualization:
*Jreality

In addition to those, many other C or C++ scene graph APIs offer Java support through JNI.

At a lower level, the JOGL (JSR 231) OpenGL bindings for Java are a popular alternative to scene graph APIs such as Java 3D. LWJGL is another such binding.

<text>Liriel Domiciano (born November 26, 1981) is a Brazilian pop star and classical singer. She is a soprano. She was born in São Paulo. Along with Rinaldo Viana, she won the&quot; &quot;Quem Sabe Canta, Quem Não Sabe Dança&quot; from &quot;Programa Raul Gil&quot;, the equivalent of the United States&#x27; American Idol. Their first CD, Romance, became the second-highest classical bestseller in Brazilian history. Two CDs released later also became bestsellers.

== Life ==
Liriel was discovered at a bridal fair in São Paulo. She had never taken formal singing lessons, but was singing classical arias at the age of 5. Around the age of 14, she began singing with a group called &quot;Voices of Zion.&quot; She was applying for a job as a seamstress at the bridal fair, but auditioned instead to be a wedding singer, choosing a Puccini aria for her material. Within a short time, she was on television.

== Religion ==
Domiciano joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) at the age of 14. It has proven to be an important part of her life and character. During the 8 months of the &quot;Raul Gil Amateur Show&quot;, she wore a medallion that represented her faith and values. She also decided not to sign with Brazil&#x27;s biggest talent agency because she has made a commitment to sing for the Church.

On April 4, 2004, Liriel became the first soloist to sing at the LDS Church&#x27;s General Conference since the 1930s.

<text>Where You Want to Be is the second studio album by American rock band Taking Back Sunday. While touring to promote &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; (2002), guitarist John Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper left the group and were replaced by Fred Mascherino and Matt Rubano, respectively. After a co-headlining tour with Saves the Day in fall 2003, the band began working on &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;. Dismissive of several early songs, they wanted to &quot;grow musically with this [new album].&quot; In March 2004 recording of &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; began, with Lou Giordano as producer. The band recorded at Mission Sound in Brooklyn, New York for two weeks before moving to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey, finishing recording by April.

The first single from &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; was &quot;A Decade Under the Influence,&quot; which was released to radio in late June 2004. While Taking Back Sunday was on the 2004 Warped Tour, &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; was released in late July on Victory Records. After an appearance at the Reading Festival in England, the group toured Europe and began a U.S. fall tour. They worked with Blink-182 member Tom DeLonge to create a music video, &quot;This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know),&quot; which was filmed in 48 hours. The band went on a winter tour with Atreyu and Funeral for a Friend, and &quot;This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)&quot; was released to radio in early January 2005. Taking Back Sunday then began a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World.

&quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; has received mixed-to-positive reviews, selling 163,000 copies in its first week. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, remaining there for an additional 19 weeks. It topped the Independent Albums chart and remained on that chart for 50 weeks. &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; reached number 16 on the Alternative Songs chart and the UK Top 75 chart. &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; is Victory&#x27;s highest-charting album; in July 2005 it was certified gold in the U.S. for sales of 500,000 copies, and sales have since exceeded 700,000.

==Background==
Taking Back Sunday released its debut album, &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;, in March 2002 and spent most of the year and 2003 touring. Though the album only spent one week (at number 183) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it ended up spending 68 weeks the Heatseekers Albums chart (eventually peaking at number 9), and 78 weeks on the Independent Albums chart (peaking at number 8). Despite little airplay, the album had sold 110,000 copies by early 2003. In September 2002, the band went on tour; on this stint, vocalist Adam Lazzara fell off the stage and gashed his face in two places, in addition to dislocating his hip. Though the incident forced the group to drop off the tour, they spent the downtime working on new material. In early 2003, guitarist John Nolan said they were aiming to record in the near future, with plans to re-recorded two older songs, namely &quot;The Ballad of Sal Villanueva&quot; and &quot;Your Own Disaster&quot;. In April 2003, Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper left the band and later formed Straylight Run. Despite initially citing exhaustion from touring as the reason for his departure, Nolan later revealed his reasons for leaving included constant fighting within the group, as well as his deteriorating friendship with Lazzara.

A short period of uncertainty followed, with the group briefly considering breaking up. Two months had passed before deciding to continue without the pair. Breaking Pangaea vocalist/guitarist Fred Mascherino contacted guitarist Eddie Reyes and Reyes offered him a position. Reyes knew Mascherino from a few years prior when his old band Clockwise would play shows with Mascherino&#x27;s old band Brody. Bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with drummer Mark O&#x27;Connell, then joined the group. Rubano was initially hesitant as he was not a fan of emo music. They joined just in time for the band&#x27;s fall 2003 tour. They began writing new material, and in a few months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn&#x27;t &quot;taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [new album].&quot; According to Mascherino, the group &quot;didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some of us were new.&quot;

==Recording==
After a September–November 2003 co-headlining tour with Saves the Day, according to Rubano, the group had &quot;about 45 minutes to rest&quot; before starting work on &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;. They made demos for every song that would later feature on the album and altered them appropriately. Despite an MTV report that the band was recording in January 2004, recording for &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; did not begin until March 1. Taking Back Sunday self-financed the recording sessions. Unable to obtain Eric Valentine as producer, the band worked with Lou Giordano. Two weeks of recording were done at Mission Sound in Brooklyn, New York, with Giordano assisted by Oliver Strauss and Barbra Vlahides. Stuart Karmatz was a technician, and Todd Parker the engineer. After recording drums, bass and most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April.

Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. For some of the songs, Giordano felt that the band &quot;ought to try some things like strings and some different musical instruments&quot; aside from the group&#x27;s usual instrumentation. Conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano) was brought in and wrote what Giordano said was &quot;some pretty cool string parts&quot;. The strings were performed by the Girl Next Door String Quartet. Giordano said the strings turned the songs &quot;into a real work of art&quot;. He added that, &quot;It&#x27;s showing them some ideas that they never would have thought of themselves that still fit the identity of the band&quot;. Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; has been classed as pop-punk and emo. According to MTV, the album was &quot;driven by punchy, melodic hardcore riffs and yearning vocals&quot; similar to releases by the Movielife and Lifetime, with the band &quot;expand[ing] its musical boundaries and tak[ing] some chances.&quot; Mascherino and Rubano (who both attended jazz college) were, according to Lazzara, &quot;really schooled in music and they know their instruments really well.&quot; When they joined the band, they &quot;cleaned up and tightened our sound.&quot; The album retains the call-and-response vocals that were featured on &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;. Despite Lazzara wanting to include Mascherino as much as possible, he felt there was no need for two people to be singing certain parts, deciding to maintain the dual vocals as it was a big appeal for the group. Mascherino wanted to retain the same level of energy and mood that is present on &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;. He added that they made &quot;a better sounding&quot; album due to having more time to record it. Like &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;, the album&#x27;s song titles were gleaned primarily from TV.

&quot;Bonus Mosh Pt. II&quot; was the first song written by the new line-up; the track, along with &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot;, started out as riffs by Reyes that he brought in and jammed out with the rest of the band. Its title came from a friend of the band; the group was playing demos for the friend, and during one section of a song the friend exclaimed: &quot;Whoa, that&#x27;s a bonus mosh part two, man, that&#x27;s cool.&quot; The track had a Dashboard Confessional-like bridge section and Thursday-esque vocals. &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; is about a person&#x27;s realization that they understand less about the world than they had thought. Lazzara wrote the lyrics after breaking up with a long-term girlfriend. She had purchased tickets to a Coldplay show, and despite the break-up, the pair still went. Lazzara found the car journey highly awkward. Reyes said he had the track&#x27;s riff for a number of years, and thought it was in the vein of &quot;1979&quot; (1996) by the Smashing Pumpkins. &quot;The Union&quot; recalled &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; closer &quot;Head Club&quot;, and is followed by the string-guided ballad &quot;New American Classic&quot;. With &quot;I Am Fred Astaire&quot;, Lazzara wanted to highlight Mascherino more. The title of &quot;One-Eighty by Summer&quot; came from a bet Reyes lost, to weigh by summer. The band had rewritten &quot;Number Five with a Bullet&quot; around a dozen times before they were satisfied with it. Lazzara wrote &quot;...Slowdance on the Inside&quot; when he was in a bad mood during a snowy day at the beach. A friend had suggested to him that he could slow dance on the inside or outside. It was one of the last tracks written while Nolan and Cooper were still in the group. The members called a truce on it, since O&#x27;Connell had worked on some Straylight Run tracks, with Nolan and Cooper letting Taking Back Sunday keep &quot;...Slowdance on the Inside&quot;.

==Release==
On April 9, 2004, &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; was announced. A week later the band headlined the Skate and Surf Festival, and supported Blink-182 and Cypress Hill in May. Also in May, a music video directed by Adam Levite was filmed for &quot;A Decade Under the Influence.&quot; In the video, the band is in circles in a warehouse. Remote-control monster trucks with cameras were placed on tracks on the circles; according to Lazzara, &quot;it made everything look really sweet.&quot; &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; was released as a radio single on June 22. A CD single of the song was released, with Mike Sapone-produced demos of &quot;Little Devotional&quot; and &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; and &quot;A Decade Under the Influences music video. The group toured the UK with the Hurt Process and Recover, including a date at Download Festival. From June to August, they were part of the 2004 Warped Tour. &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; was made available for streaming via MTV on July 22, and it was released on July 27 on Victory Records. The album&#x27;s Japanese version includes a bonus track: a new version of &quot;Your Own Disaster.&quot; The album&#x27;s artwork was done by Brad Flip; Reyes proposed that Flip had the concept of &quot;the band starting over again&quot;. A sign includes the words &quot;Next Exit, 152 Miles&quot;, alluding to a gas station Lazzara and his friends would stop at Exit 152 off Interstate 40 in Mebane, North Carolina; Lazzara&#x27;s father also lived near this area. Promotion for the album included street teams handing out sampler CDs and fliers.

After an appearance at the Reading Festival, Taking Back Sunday made a brief European tour. They toured the U.S. from September to November, supported by Fall Out Boy, Matchbook Romance and Funeral for a Friend. During the tour, the band filmed a video for &quot;This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)&quot; with Blink-182&#x27;s Tom DeLonge. Over a 48-hour period, they flew from Dallas to Los Angeles to Nashville, Tennessee to film the video. According to MTV, Taking Back Sunday posted on its website that DeLonge had &quot;a great visual concept and was a very enthusiastic, focused and attentive first-time director.&quot; In November, the band began a tour with Atreyu and Funeral for a Friend. In early December, the band performed at Q101 Chicago&#x27;s Xmas festival. &quot;This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)&quot; was released as a radio single on January 11, 2005. In April and May, the band went on a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World. In May, a music video for &quot;Set Phasers to Stun&quot; featured the Hungarian dance group Troup de Pozolo de Zav. Victory Records was uncertain whether to make the video an internet-only release or send it to MTV, and on May 11 it was posted on Yahoo! Launch. On June 16, a behind-the-scenes video on the making of the &quot;Set Phasers to Stun&quot; video was posted online.

==Critical reception==

According to AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares, Taking Back Sunday &quot;sometimes comes off as less than distinctive, and the album can sound like a generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst.&quot; Phares called &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; &quot;definitely a solid album ... but crafting something a little more unique would take Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s music that much farther.&quot; On &quot;Chart Attack&quot;, despite the album&#x27;s being &quot;overwrought&quot; its &quot;quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;″s occasional off-the-chart cheese readings.&quot; Although &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Mat Hocking expected the album to be one of the &quot;grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year,&quot; it turned out to be &quot;an album that&#x27;s playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, soaring and curving with painful predictability.&quot;

In a brief review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Sean Richardson wrote that Taking Back Sunday was &quot;best suited for multipart campfire sing-alongs&quot; and struck &quot;rock-radio gold&quot; with &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;. Sam Sutherland of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that the group created &quot;an exact musical duplicate&quot; of &quot;Tell Your Friends&quot;. Although, &quot;unadventurous as it is, the melodies remain catchy and the riffs remain driving.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Laura Sinagra noted Mascherino and Rubano as assisting &quot;the will to power in Lazzara&#x27;s Cure-like croon.&quot; Sinagra called &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; the nearest that the singer gets to the &quot;emotional tensions and ragged-rock edge&quot; of &quot;Tell Your Friends&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Andy Greenwald wrote that nearly every song on the album &quot;begins in the moment just before a fight or a tear-filled breakdown.&quot; Citing &quot;New American Classic&quot; and &quot;This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know),&quot; Greenwald noted Adam Lazzara&#x27;s use of &quot;anthemic choruses like 15-year-olds use emoticons: as sweeping shorthand placeholders for feelings too complicated to puzzle out and express.&quot;

Sputnikmusic reviewer John Hanson called the album &quot;extremely repetitive, with many songs sounding exactly the same.&quot; Calling more than half the album &quot;essentially the same song,&quot; Hanson wrote: &quot;Despite all the shortcomings becoming far more apparent here, &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot; is still a tolerable, if very average and common, album.&quot; According to &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; reviewer Todd Burns, Taking Back Sunday &quot;smooth[ed] away all of the interesting bits and only focus[ed] on what works immediately and viscerally,&quot; providing &quot;cheap thrills and obvious answers.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the group &quot;cobbled together a host of emo clichés&quot; to create a record that is &quot;miraculously, more winsome than generic.&quot; Despite some &quot;bittersweet confessional&quot; songs which &quot;resort to tired teen-angst whines,&quot; &quot;an arresting tug-of-war between raw emotions and charged rhythms&quot; pushes the band beyond &quot;the everyday emo-rock ensemble.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number three, selling 163,000 copies in its first week and remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. Victory Records&#x27; highest-charting release, it surpassed the previous record held by Atreyu&#x27;s &quot;The Curse&quot; (which peaked at number 34). The album topped the Independent Albums chart, remaining on the chart for 50 weeks, and charted at number 70 in the UK. &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; peaked at number 16 on the Alternative Songs chart and number 70 on the UK Singles Chart. After three weeks, 260,000 copies of the album had been sold. By the end of 2004, album sales stood at 458,000 copies. &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; was ranked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums year-end chart at number 159, and by February 2005 sales had reached 566,000.

It became one of the best-selling independent rock albums within a year, selling 634,000 copies by June. As a result of this success, the group signed to Warner Bros. in the same month. The album was certified gold the following month by the RIAA. Taking Back Sunday was the first Victory Records band with a gold album; although the label did not intend to certify the album, it was certified by the group&#x27;s label at the time, Warner Bros. According to Victory Records founder Tony Brummel, &quot;From where I sit, this is another attempt by the RIAA and its major-label partners to victimize, abuse and belittle an independent record company.&quot; Band manager Jillian Newman responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how a label gets victimized by receiving a sales award.&quot; By September, 667,000 copies had been sold; in early 2006 album sales stood at 700,000 copies.

==Legacy==
In 2005, JJ Koczan of &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; might &quot;perhaps go down in pop culture history as the record that broke the emo scene commercially.&quot; Six tracks from the album were included on the 2007 &quot;Notes from the Past&quot; compilation. In 2014, &quot;Alternative Press&quot;″ Brian Kraus wrote that it was &quot;the closest they&#x27;ve come to the elusive &#x27;perfect album. Calling it &quot;catchy&quot; in comparison to &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;, the album &quot;matured the words past freshman year and flexed the rhythm guitar to a new level.&quot; In 2016, Fuse.tv ranked &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; its number-one Taking Back Sunday album. According to Jason Lipshutz, the album &quot;still smacks harder&quot; than the band&#x27;s other releases due to &quot;a masterful sequencing, tighter hooks and most transcendent single (&quot;A Decade Under The Influence&quot;).&quot;

Throughout 2019, Taking Back Sunday performed &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; in its entirety for their 20th anniversary world tour. For cities in the US that had two shows back-to-back, the band would flip a coin to play either &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; or &quot;Louder Now&quot; (2006) on the first night and the other album on the second night. To help promote the tour, a career-spanning compilation &quot;Twenty&quot; (2019) was released, which included &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;Set Phasers to Stun&quot; and &quot;One-Eighty by Summer&quot; from &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;. &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; appeared on a best-of emo songs list by &quot;Vulture&quot;. The album was an influence on As It Is as frontman Patty Walters explained: &quot;Everything that our band knows - the riffs, the lyrics, the mic swings - we learned it all from Taking Back Sunday&quot;.

*Culpeper County, Virginia, named for one of three members of the Colepeper family, of which two were women: Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper of Thoresway, a colonial governor of Virginia; his first wife Margaretta van Hesse, called Margaret, Lady Colepeper; or their daughter, Thomas&#x27;s heir and only surviving issue, Catherine Colepeper.
*Elmore County, Idaho, named for the Ida Elmore mines, which may have been named for a woman named Ida Elmore.
*Ida County, Iowa, possibly named for Ida Smith, the first European American child born in the county.
*Jessamine County, Kentucky, traditionally said to be named for Jessamine Douglas, the daughter of surveyor James Douglas. Local tradition claims that she was an early settler killed by Native Americans, but other accounts say that she died by suicide after an unhappy love affair. &quot;A Directory of United States Counties&quot; (2006) calls the story &quot;baseless&quot;, saying that the county is named for the Jessamine Creek and the jasmine flowers that grow next to it.
*Louisa County, Iowa, named either for Louisa Massey of Dubuque, Iowa, who, according to legend, killed the murderer of her brother; or for Louisa County, Virginia.
*Maries County, Missouri, named for the Maries River, which may be named after one or more Maries.
*Montour County, Pennsylvania, named for the Métis interpreter John Montour, or possibly his mother Madame Montour.
* St. Clair County, Michigan, named either for Arthur St. Clair, the first governor of the Northwest Territory, or for Saint Clare of Assisi, on whose feast day Lake St. Clair was seen during an expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.

<doc id="1003059" wikidata="Q198650" url="?curid=1003059" title="Lodève">
<text>Lodève (; , ; ) is a commune in the department of Hérault, in the region of Occitania, southern France. It is a subprefecture of the department. The derivation of the city&#x27;s name is from Gaulish &quot;Luteva&quot;, composed of lut-, swamp, mud + suffix -eva. It might therefore translate as &quot;the muddy place&quot; or &quot;the swamp city&quot;. This mud could be a clay, called argillite, which was use during ancient history to produce pottery.

==Geography==

Lodève lies where the coastal plain rises up to the Larzac plateau, from Montpellier, where the river Lergue and the smaller river Soulondre meet. Lodève is surrounded by green hills and vineyards and lies only from the large man-made Lac du Salagou.

==Climate==
Lodève has a mostly mediterranean climate, with hot summers favourable to viticulture. Violent storms and torrential rain are frequently seen in late summer, leading to flooding and the muds and swamps that gave the city its name.

==History==
Lodève started as the capital of a tribe of the Volcae, the &quot;Lutevani&quot;, before becoming the Roman city &quot;Luteva&quot; (also known as &quot;Forum Neronis&quot;). The town was a stopping point on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela via the Arles road. From the 5th century until the French Revolution, it was the seat of the Bishops of Lodève. It was also a centre for textile production under Louis XV and was home to one of only two royal manufactories for tapestry, the other being the one of the Gobelins in Paris.

More recently, the area was the centre of a firm resistance against the Nazi occupation during the Second World War.

==Sights==
* Lodève Cathedral (&quot;Cathédrale Saint-Fulcran de Lodève&quot;), parts of which date from the sixth century.
* Museum Fleury (temporary art exhibitions (mainly paintings) and a permanent archaeological collection).
* Halle Dardé, dedicated to local sculptor Paul Dardé.
* L&#x27;Atelier national du tapis de Lodève, the French state carpet-making workshop (visits arranged by Tourist Office, Lodève).

In the vicinity:
* Cave: Grotte de Labeil.
* Saint-Michel de Grandmont Priory and its dolmen.
* Lerab Ling: Buddhist Temple in traditional Tibetan form.

==Culture==
Throughout the year, the town hosts a programme of cultural and sporting events, as well as all sorts of markets. In recent years, the Museum Art Gallery has gained national acclaim for its major art exhibitions.

The &quot;Voix de la Méditerranée&quot; poetry festival, established in 1998, takes place every July for around 9 days, and involves poets, musicians and writers from many different countries on the Mediterranean.

The annual &quot;Fête de St. Fulcran&quot;, the patron saint of the town, takes place in May and includes the procession of the saint&#x27;s relics and a funfair.

==Population==

Lodève has a fairly large Algerian (see pied noir, harki) population, the first generation of which fought for the French and were housed here after the Algerian Civil War.
==Transportation==
The town lies on the A75 autoroute about 30 minutes south of the new Millau viaduct, the highest bridge in the world.

==Personalities==
Lodève was the birthplace of:
* André-Hercule de Fleury (1653-1743) a cardinal who served as the chief minister of Louis XV. Lodève&#x27;s municipal museum is named after him.
* Jean Louis Conneau aka André Beaumont (1880-1937), pioneer aviator.
* Georges Auric (1899-1983), composer.
* Paul Dardé (1888-1963), sculptor. The middle school is named after him.
* Joseph Vallot (1854 – 1925), the alpinist who installed an observatory on Mont Blanc. Lodève&#x27;s high school is named after him.

==Economy==
The town houses a famous carpet-manufacturing company, part of the national Savonnerie, which once supplied carpets to the French royal family, and still today produces hand-made carpets for State buildings.

Viticulture, focussed on the Carignan grape variety, is a major industry. The climate is also favourable for fruit production, and the region&#x27;s peaches, apricots, melons and tomatoes are prized.

==International relations==
Lodève is twinned with South Kirkby and Moorthorpe, UK and Gjakova, Kosovo.

<doc id="1003061" wikidata="Q16209121" url="?curid=1003061" title="Jacob Hoggard">
<text>Jacob William Hoggard (born July 9, 1984) is a Canadian former musician who was the lead singer for the pop rock band Hedley. Hoggard competed on the second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; in 2004 when he placed third.

In 2018, Hoggard was arrested and charged with sexual assault. He has since been found guilty of sexual assault causing bodily harm and sentenced to five years in prison. After an appeal was dismissed, Hoggard began serving a five year sentence. He was found not guilty of a third charge of sexual assault by a jury in northeastern Ontario.

==Early life==
Jacob Hoggard was born on July 9, 1984, in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. He was raised in Abbotsford, British Columbia, and Surrey, British Columbia. He is of partial Italian origin. He was educated in Surrey, British Columbia, at Senator Reid Elementary School and Mennonite Educational Institute, Yale Secondary School in Abbotsford and at L.A. Matheson Secondary School, he was also in the City Central Learning Centre.

==Career==
Hoggard started his career on Canadian Idol. He appeared on the second season of the show and made it to the final three. He formed the band Hedley along with Dave Rosin, Tommy Mac and Chris Crippin. The band released their debut single &quot;On My Own&quot;, which reached number 1 on the Canadian Singles Chart.

In 2010, Hoggard took part of Young Artists for Haiti and the song reached number 1 on the Canadian Hot 100 charts.

Hoggard took part of Artists Against Bullying in 2012 to record and release a remake of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;True Colors&quot; for Bullying Awareness Week. Hoggard was host of the Juno Awards of 2015.

==Personal life==
Hoggard married his high school sweetheart in 2005, which ended in divorce in 2009. Hoggard married Canadian actress Rebekah Asselstine on December 31, 2018 at the age of 34.

==Sexual offenses==
In 2005, Hoggard and his band members were suspects in a sexual assault case where a minor was found unconscious and shoeless outside a London, Ontario, venue where the band had played. Rohypnol was present in the victim&#x27;s blood. The police investigation ended when the victim refused a rape kit and the band sent the venue management a letter stating any discussion of the incident would result in a lawsuit.

In March 2018, he announced that he would be stepping away from his music career indefinitely following Hedley&#x27;s tour. Since announcing the indefinite hiatus from Hedley following the sexual assault allegations, Hoggard testified in court on May 24, 2022, that he has made a living as a carpenter in British Columbia.

On July 23, 2018, Hoggard was charged with one count of sexual interference and two counts of sexual assault causing bodily harm, involving a child under 16 and a woman. Originally scheduled for November 28, 2018, his trial was postponed several times and eventually began on May 2, 2022. On June 5, 2022, a Toronto jury found Hoggard guilty of sexual assault causing bodily harm against an Ottawa woman in the fall of 2016. The jury also acquitted Hoggard of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old child who was a fan and one count of sexual interference. On October 20, 2022, Hoggard was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting an Ottawa woman.

Hoggard was also charged in March 2022 with sexual assault causing bodily harm regarding a June 2016 encounter in Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The charge was made public on June 2. Hoggard was scheduled to appear in court on August 4, 2022. This accuser testified in September 2024 that Hoggard allegedly raped, hit and choked her before urinating on her in a hotel room after a Hedley concert. Hoggard was acquitted of the charge on October 4, 2024.

On August 16, 2024, Ontario&#x27;s top court upheld the sexual assault conviction of Hoggard, dismissing his appeal and confirming his five-year prison sentence. It was confirmed that he has started to serve his sentence behind bars. On September 13, Ontario&#x27;s top court dismissed Hoggard&#x27;s application for bail, leading Hoggard to attempt an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

<doc id="1003069" wikidata="Q2366720" url="?curid=1003069" title="Super Pac-Man">
<text>is a 1982 maze video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It is an official sequel to the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;; Midway had previously commissioned General Computer Corporation to develop an unofficial sequel &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, which Namco had little involvement with beyond licensing. Toru Iwatani returns as designer.

==Gameplay==
Sound and gameplay mechanics were altered radically from the first two entries into the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; series—instead of eating dots, the player is required to eat keys in order to open doors, which open up sections of the maze that contain what in earlier games were known as &quot;fruits&quot; (foods such as apples and bananas, or other prizes such as &quot;Galaxian&quot; flagships), which are now the basic items that must be cleared. Once all the food is eaten, the player advances to the next level, in which the food is worth more points. In earlier levels, keys unlock nearby doors, while as the player progresses through the levels, it is more common for keys to open faraway doors. Pac-Man can enter the ghost house at any time without a key.

In addition to the original power pellets which allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts, two &quot;Super&quot; pellets are available and will turn Pac-Man into Super Pac-Man for a short time. In this form, he becomes much larger, can move with increased speed when the &quot;Super Speed&quot; button is held down and has the ability to eat through doors without unlocking them. He is also invulnerable to the ghosts, who appear thin and flat in order to give the illusion of Super Pac-Man &quot;flying&quot; over them. He still cannot eat them without the help of the original power-up. When Super Pac-Man is about to revert to regular Pac-Man, he flashes white. The Super power can then be prolonged by eating a power pellet or super pellet, if available.

A point bonus can be scored if Pac-Man eats a star that appears between the two center boxes while assorted symbols flash inside them. Usually, one symbol stops while the other continues until the star is eaten, a life is lost, or too much time elapses. If the star is eaten when two symbols match, the bonus is 2000 points for any match, and 5000 points if the matching symbols are the same as the level being played. Otherwise, the bonus is similar to the award for eating a ghost, which is 200, 400, 800 or 1600 points, depending on the level. (On some versions, higher levels might pay out the 2000 or 5000 points no matter what the symbols are.)

Bonus levels appear at intervals. Here, the player is presented with a maze full of food items and must eat them all in order to collect the points on a countdown timer. Pac-Man appears in Super Mode throughout the stage, and there should be no ghosts.

==Reception==
Upon release in 1982, Midway projected that the game would sell about 10,000 to 15,000 arcade units in the United States. By May 1983, it was the top-earning arcade game of the month.

&quot;Arcade Express&quot; rated the arcade game 8 out of 10, stating that the &quot;newly-designed maze features keys, locked doors, and Super Energy Dots, making it the latest thrill for gobbler-lovers.&quot; The review also praises the ability to increase Pac-Man&#x27;s size with the &quot;Super Dots&quot; as well as the &quot;Super-Speed&quot; button that increases his movement speed.

Iwatani himself was critical on the game, criticizing how big Pac-Man was while in Super form and also calling it overall boring.

==Ports==
Ports for the Casio PV-2000 and the Sord M5 were released in Japan under the titles &quot;Mr. Packn&quot; and &quot;Power Pac&quot;. In 1988, MS-DOS and Commodore 64 versions were released.

Ports for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were finished in 1984, but not published.

The game was also available on the Game Boy Color with the release of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man Special Color Edition&quot;.

==Legacy==
* In 1996, &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot; appeared on the second &quot;Namco Museum&quot; arcade compilation for the PlayStation (not included in the Japanese version).
*In 1998, Namco released &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot; as part of &quot;Namco History&quot; Volume 3 for the PC in Japan only.

<doc id="1003071" wikidata="Q2119325" url="?curid=1003071" title="The Irish Rovers">
<text>The Irish Rovers is a group of Irish musicians that formed in Toronto, Canada in 1963 and named after the traditional song &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;. They are best known for their international television series, contributing to the popularization of Irish Music in North America, and for the songs &quot;The Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot;, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That a Party&quot;, &quot;The Orange and the Green&quot;, &quot;Whiskey on a Sunday&quot;, &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;, &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; and &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot;.

The primary voices heard in the group&#x27;s early songs were Will Millar (tenor), Jimmy Ferguson (baritone), George Millar and Joe Millar, and in the last twenty years, also John Reynolds and Ian Millar. Wilcil McDowell&#x27;s accordion has been a signature sound of the band throughout their more than fifty five years.

Founding member George Millar and his cousin Ian are both from Ballymena, Davey Walker from Armagh, Sean O&#x27;Driscoll from Cork, Gerry O&#x27;Connor from Dundalk, percussionist Fred Graham from Belfast. Flute and whistle player Geoffrey Kelly was born in Dumfries, Scotland.

In the 1980s, the group briefly renamed itself The Rovers. During this period, their song &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That a Party&quot; led to crossover success in the country rock genre.

The Irish Rovers have represented Canada at five World Expos, and in 2018 were honoured as one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest exports at Dublin, Ireland&#x27;s EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum.

In 2023, they celebrated their 60th Anniversary, and their song, &quot;Hey Boys Sing Us A Song&quot; was nominated for Single of the Year in the Canadian Folk Music Awards.

==History==

===Northern Ireland===
The brothers George Millar and Will Millar were both born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The children grew up in a musical household as their father Bob played button-key accordion for several bands throughout the years. Their cousin Joe Millar, who also sang, took part in the family kitchen parties playing button-key accordion and harmonica. As children, George and Will performed with their sister, Sandra Beech as &quot;The Millar Kids&quot; in Ireland, before the family emigrated to Canada.

===The early years===
In 1963, George met fellow Irish native Jimmy Ferguson at an Irish function in Toronto. They sang together until dawn, and founded the Irish Rovers. According to a Calgary Herald article in 1971, &quot;George and Jimmy formed the first Irish Rovers for an amateur variety show in Toronto and won.&quot;

George&#x27;s cousin, Joe also soon emigrated to Toronto and was recruited as he stepped off the plane.

The name &quot;The Irish Rovers&quot; was suggested by George&#x27;s mother. The traditional Irish song about a sailing ship had been a favourite from their kitchen parties in Ballymena. For a short time, George, Jimmy and Joe were joined by Vic Marcus and Doug Henderson. George&#x27;s father, Bob, became The Irish Rovers&#x27;s first manager booking the new band at folk song festivals, clubs, hootenannies and The Port o&#x27; Call. According to a 1964 newspaper in the Millars&#x27; home town in Ireland, &quot;The folk singing &#x27;boom&#x27; in the United States and Canada proved profitable for three young Ballymena men who form the nucleus of a popular, Toronto-based group who call themselves &#x27;The Irish Rovers.&#x27;&quot;

In the early 60s, Will Millar and his friend Brian Evans performed in a Toronto Calypso group, The Kalypso Kews. After moving to Calgary, Will formed a folk trio in Calgary along with another Ulster native, Derek Swinson. He also developed quite a following singing at Phil&#x27;s Pancake House, and then landing a job singing on Calgary&#x27;s &quot;Just 4 Fun&quot;, a local TV show for children. &quot;We would go in, singing Irish songs like &#x27;Whiskey, you&#x27;re the devil&#x27; on the show&quot;, a quote from their &quot;Best of the Irish Rovers&quot; album CD case booklet.

In the latter half of 1964, after more than six months performing in the Toronto area, George, Jimmy and Joe left to visit Will in Calgary. In 1979, Jimmy told &quot;Canadian Music Magazine&quot;, &quot;We actually formed the group in Toronto. I sang, George played guitar and at that time Joe was playing a little button key accordion. We were ambitious in those days, we&#x27;d played the clubs to death in Toronto and we didn&#x27;t know what to do next; what direction to take. So we decided to visit Will in Calgary, ended up staying there, and the Irish Rovers became four.&quot; Joe moved his family out from Toronto, and the band continued in Calgary.

George was enrolled in a local Calgary high school and Jimmy worked at a local Calgary slaughter house. Jimmy&#x27;s job would last but a few hours. George soon quit school and Will&#x27;s home became the new home base for the band.

The Irish Rovers became regulars at Calgary&#x27;s Depression Coffeehouse, a folk club operated by John Uren that also contributed to the start of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s career.

===Down to &quot;Americay&quot;===
Will introduced the group to his manager Les Weinstein who became the band&#x27;s full-time manager, while Will became the band leader.

The Rovers drove to California in 1966, hoping to perform in the folk clubs there. On the way, their car broke down near Dinucci&#x27;s Restaurant in Valley Ford, CA which was briefly owned by two Irish immigrants Jerry Murphy and Peter Moran. The boys were given room and board and an introduction to Jan Brainerd, a booking agent who helped them secure an appearance at The Purple Onion in San Francisco where they played sold-out houses for five months. The group was then booked at other folk clubs across California. The area they stayed at on this booking became the inspiration for their song &quot;Mrs. Crandall&#x27;s Boarding House&quot;, according to their 1999 album &quot;The best of the Irish Rovers&quot; (which has a booklet in the front of its CD case).

In 1966, the Rovers signed a recording contract with Decca Records with Charles Dant and recorded their first album, &quot;The First of the Irish Rovers,&quot; at The Ice House in Pasadena. The album was successful enough to warrant another album, which included their first hit, which was from a song originally written and recorded in 1962 by Shel Silverstein, &quot;The Unicorn.&quot; Glen Campbell played guitar on the original recording. After recording the album, Joe left the band for a more &quot;reliable&quot; income for a family man. It was at this time that they invited All-Ireland Champion Wilcil McDowell to join the band. After the success of &quot;The Unicorn&quot;, Joe returned to the band. The album included the Irish tunes &quot;The Orange and the Green&quot; and &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot;. Wilcil&#x27;s accordion has continued to be a signature sound of the band.

Starting in the late 60s, the Irish Rovers performed on various North American television programs including several appearances on the TV western &quot;The Virginian,&quot; as well as &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,&quot; &quot;The Mike Douglas Show,&quot; &quot;The Dating Game,&quot; &quot;The Pig and Whistle,&quot; and &quot;The Beachcombers.&quot;

In 1968, they were named &quot;Folk Group of the Year&quot; by the predecessor of the JUNO Awards, and in 1969 they received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Folk Performance of the Year&quot;.

===The Rovers era===
In the early 1980s, the group adjusted its style and began aiming itself towards the country-rock field. Renamed The Rovers, the group scored a major international hit with &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That a Party&quot; and also found success with the Christmas novelty recording &quot;Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer&quot;. By the late 1980s, however, the group had reverted to their original Irish Rovers branding.

===On television===
In 1971, The Irish Rovers were offered their own CBC-produced television series, &quot;The Irish Rovers Show&quot;. While entertaining a family audience, the show promoted Ireland and Irish music to North Americans. Guest stars included their friends The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Bobby Darin, Glen Campbell, Vera Lynn and Anne Murray. Visits from Shari Lewis and her puppets, including Lamb Chop, were audience favourites. There were regularly taped visits to Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, New Zealand, P.E.I., Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Banff and even Alert – at the tip of Ellesmere Island – the farthest, northerly inhabited base in the world.

&quot;The Irish Rovers Show&quot; ran for 7 years, winning an ACTRA Award for Best Variety Performance. Brothers Will and George Millar co-wrote the majority of their original Irish compositions. Producer and Director Ken Gibson and Michael Watt often hosted special effects technicians from L.A. who were learning the new green screen technology, which were used for comedic leprechaun segments featuring Will, George and Jimmy, and is later used in &quot;The Mother Goose Video Treasury&quot; in 1987. The Rovers then continued with another television series on the Global Television Network in conjunction with Ulster Television in Ireland.

Although most of their music focuses on the band&#x27;s Irish roots, in the early 1980s The Irish Rovers recorded an unknown novelty Christmas song written by Randy Brooks. Record producer Jack Richardson produced The Rovers&#x27; album, &quot;It Was A Night Like This.&quot; The single release of &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; rose to the top 20 in Canada within a week of airplay. Exposure of the music on television also added to the popularity of their music.

In 1980, their crossover hit recording of Tom Paxton&#x27;s &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That a Party&quot;, which was inspired by the boys&#x27; own after-show partying, put them at the top of the charts again. In 1981, the group starred in their second Canadian TV series: &quot;The Rovers Comedy House,&quot; a seven-part CBC series of comedy and boisterous Irish music produced by Ken Gibson. For most of the 1980s the band was known as &quot;The Rovers&quot; and followed up hits with songs such as &quot;Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy&quot; and &quot;No More Bread and Butter&quot;.

Their third television series, &quot;Party with the Rovers,&quot; ran from 1984 to 1986 with Jack Richardson as musical director and Ken Gibson as Executive Producer. The show was set in a traditional pub setting featuring music sessions with the band performing together with Liam Clancy, Tommy Makem, John Allan Cameron, Kenny Rogers, Lonnie Donegan, Andy Gibb, Rita Coolidge, Ronnie Prophet, and many others. The series was produced for Global in conjunction with Ulster Television in Ireland, and was syndicated around the world.

The band members became Canadian citizens after Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, asked them to do so, to officially represent Canada around the world. By 1989 they had represented Canada at five world Expos: Montreal (1967), Osaka, Japan (1970), Okinawa, Japan (1976), Vancouver (1986), and Brisbane, Australia (1988). In recognition of their quarter century of contributions of Canadian music to the International music world, they were awarded Canada&#x27;s top music honour, the Performing Rights Organization&#x27;s (PROCAN) Harold Moon Award. With their double album &quot;25th Anniversary Collection&quot; in 1989, which featured the backing of The Chieftains and songs written by, amongst others, Randy Bachman, Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, the band was, once again, officially known as The Irish Rovers, but many fans still refer to them as The Rovers.

Will announced his departure in 1994 and has become a successful artist focusing on the Ireland of old as a favourite subject matter. Upon departure, George replaced him as bandleader and hired fellow musicians John Reynolds and Wallace Hood.

After a court battle for the name of &quot;The Irish Rovers&quot;, the full band continued to tour, then filmed the video &quot;The Irish Rovers, Live and Well&quot;, plus the CD, &#x27;Celtic Collection: The Next Thirty Years&#x27;. Over the following two years they followed up with two more albums, &quot;Gems&quot;, and &quot;Come Fill Up Your Glasses&quot;. While the band was on tour in Worcester, Massachusetts in October 1997, Jimmy Ferguson died of a heart attack.

For a return to television in 2011, the band filmed the television special, &quot;The Irish Rovers, Home in Ireland.&quot; Locations for the special included Dunluce Castle, Carnlough Harbour, Portglenone, and various spots along the northeast coast of Northern Ireland. The show was transmitted in 2011 and 2012 across the PBS Network in North America.

In 2012 &quot;The Irish Rovers Christmas&quot; television special, which was filmed at various locations in Banff National Park, Sunshine Village and Chatham-Kent&#x27;s Capitol Theatre, was shown across the PBS Network throughout the US and Canada and was broadcast in New Zealand on Sky TV.

In 2015 The Rovers filmed their own 50th Anniversary LIVE on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day concert in Nanaimo, Canada. Shaw Communications also filmed behind the scenes at the event for a music documentary titled &quot;The Irish Rovers 50th Anniversary Special&quot;. It was broadcast nationally in Canada on SHAW Video on Demand in 2015 and 2016.

The two-DVD set &quot;LIVE on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; which was filmed at The Port Theatre on Vancouver Island and Lismore, Ireland, was released in 2017. All three television specials were released on DVD and may be rebroadcast during the holiday seasons.

===Rover Records and touring===

In 1993 the band formed their own record company, Rover Records, which allowed them artistic freedom that as a younger band they could not afford. George Millar continues to write songs for the band, with Rover Records producing their last sixteen albums including &quot;Celtic Collection,&quot; &quot;Come Fill Up Your Glasses,&quot; &quot;Down by the Lagan Side,&quot; &quot;Still Rovin&#x27; After All These Years,&quot; and their Greatest Hits albums, &quot;40 Years a-Rovin&#x27;,&quot; and &quot;The Irish Rovers&#x27;s Gems.&quot; Their Irish homeland continues to be the primary subject of their music, as in &quot;Erin&#x27;s Green Isle&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Return&quot;, &quot;Dear Little Shamrock Shore&quot;, &quot;Dunluce Castle&quot;, &quot;Home to Bantry Bay&quot;, &quot;The Dublin Pub Crawl&quot;, and &quot;Gracehill Fair&quot;. Recently, their recording of &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot; reached a younger audience on YouTube.

In 2010, The Irish Rovers marked their 45th anniversary with the release of the CD &quot;Gracehill Fair,&quot; which won a local music award on their home base of Vancouver Island.

The band returned to the World Music charts in 2011 with their album, &quot;Home in Ireland.&quot;

In 2012, their single, &quot;The Titanic&quot;, released from their &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot; album, focused attention on Belfast and the Harland and Wolff shipyard that had built the &quot;Titanic&quot; a century before. After the song, and accompanying video made headlines in Belfast, N. Ireland, it was also featured in a Canadian documentary for the CBC which aided in returning the credit of building the ship to the Northern Ireland shipyards of Belfast. The album was produced in response to YouTube activity.

The release of &quot;The Irish Rovers, 50 Years&quot; compilation album supported their Farewell To Rovin&#x27; Tour which will take a few years to complete. 
They followed that up with the second children&#x27;s album of their career, &quot;Songs For The Wee Folk&quot;, then in 2016 another LIVE album and television special. The 50th anniversary of their famed Unicorn song in 2017 was marked with re-recording the songs and featuring a new sequel to &quot;The Unicorn&quot; and a video that explained what happened to their ill-fated Unicorn for the album &quot;Continuing Story of The Unicorn&quot;. Scottish singer Jimmie Macgregor joined the band for &quot;The Scottish Album, Up Among The Heather&quot; in 2018. 2019 touring took the band across the US and to Ireland where they were honoured in the hometown of Ballymena and in Dublin for all they have done for Ireland and Irish music throughout the world.

With the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band has not taken a break from touring since 1965. Joe Millar retired from the band in 2005 when his son, Ian took up the family ranks. Ian performed with his Dad once on stage before taking over his father&#x27;s spot. With the recent departure of Wilcil McDowell from touring, the present line-up leaves co-founder George Millar as the only remaining current member tied to the 1960s lineup.

The COVID-19 pandemic cut short the 2020 release of &quot;Saints And Sinners&quot; album which George wrote and featured &quot;The Banshee&#x27;s Cry&quot; and &quot;Band Without A Country&quot;, both released with videos. During Covid, bandleader George Millar wrote and produced their latest album, &quot;No End In Sight&quot; which features, &quot;The Wellerman&quot; and &quot;Hey Boys Sing Us A Song&quot;, which was nominated Canadian Folk Music Awards Single of the Year.

The sold-out 2023 tour was one of the most extensive tours of the last decade.

*CH-3257 Grossaffoltern
*CH-3283 Kallnach

<text>The Rosenberg Fund for Children (RFC) is a public foundation started in 1990 by Robert Meeropol and named in honor of his parents Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, the only two United States civilians executed for conspiracy to commit espionage during the Cold War. 

Orphaned at age 6, Robert was adopted by Anne and Abel Meeropol.

At a fundraiser on the 50th anniversary of his parents&#x27; execution, Robert described the fund, which he runs, as his &quot;constructive revenge.&quot;
The fund &quot;makes grants to aid children in the U.S. whose parents are targeted, progressive activists&quot; and to &quot;assist youth who themselves have been targeted as a result of their progressive activities.&quot; They do not pay for legal expenses. , the organization has given over $4.5 million in grants to nearly 500 children since 1990.

<text>Captain John Niel Randle, VC (22 December 1917 – 6 May 1944) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His was one of three Second World War VCs awarded for action in India, the other two being awarded to John Pennington Harman (also at the Battle of Kohima) and Abdul Hafiz at the Battle of Imphal.

==Early life==
John Niel Randle was born in India, the son of Edith Joan, daughter of William Chaffey Whitby, and Dr. Herbert Niel Randle, Librarian of the India Office Library, who was also Professor of Philosophy at Queen&#x27;s College, Benares and a writer on Indian philosophy.

Randle was educated at the Dragon School, Marlborough College, and Merton College, Oxford. At Oxford he qualified in law. His best friend there, Leonard Cheshire, was awarded the VC in the Second World War. Randle married Mavis Ellen Manser of Holywell, Oxford, sister of Leslie Thomas Manser who was awarded the VC posthumously in 1942 after a bombing raid on Cologne.

==Military career==
Randle was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Norfolk Regiment in May 1940. At the age of 26, he was promoted to temporary captain whilst serving with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment.

Captain Randle was commander of &#x27;B&#x27; Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment. On 4 May 1944 during the Battle of Kohima in northeast India, he was ordered to attack the Japanese flank on General Purpose Transport (GPT) Ridge during the relief and clearance of Kohima. The citation from the &quot;London Gazette&quot; reads:

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is on loan to the Imperial War Museum by his son John. It is displayed alongside that of his friend Leonard Cheshire.

==Legacy==

Randle was portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;, which included archive footage, dramatisations of his actions and an interview with his son and grandson.

A memorial to Captain Randle is in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Petersham.

<doc id="1003084" wikidata="Q1706677" url="?curid=1003084" title="Joseph Brennan (Fianna Fáil politician)">
<text>Joseph Peter Brennan (14 February 1913 – 13 July 1980) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1977 to 1980, Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1973 to 1977, Minister for Social Welfare from 1970 to 1973 and 1966 to 1969, Minister for Labour from 1969 to 1973, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1965 to 1966, and a Parliamentary Secretary from 1959 to 1965. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1951 to 1980.

==Early and personal life==
He was born in Dunkineely, County Donegal, the son of farmer Francis Brennan and Hannah Carr. He was educated locally and developed great skill at Gaelic football, playing for his county team.

He began his working life as a freelance journalist with &quot;The Irish Press&quot; and the &quot;Donegal Democrat&quot; before establishing himself as an auctioneer, estate agent, and spirit merchant. During The Emergency he served in the FCA, retiring as Officer commanding of the South Donegal Battalion.

He married first Bridget (d. 1940), they had one son and four daughters. In February 1942 he married Margaret McDevitt.

==Politics==
He polled the highest number of first preferences in the 1949 Donegal West by-election but failed to be elected. Brennan was elected as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Donegal West constituency at the 1951 general election and was re-elected at each election until his death. As constituency boundaries were changed, he represented Donegal South-West from 1961 to 1969, Donegal–Leitrim from 1969 to 1977, and Donegal from 1977 to 1980.

In 1959, when Seán Lemass succeeded as Taoiseach, Brennan was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. After the 1961 general election, he was appointed as Government Chief Whip, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. After the 1965 general election, Brennan joined the cabinet when he was appointed as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.

In 1966, when Jack Lynch succeeded as Taoiseach, Brennan was appointed as Minister for Social Welfare. Following the 1969 general election he was appointed as Minister for Labour. In the wake of the Arms Crisis in 1970 he was appointed to the additional portfolio of Social Welfare. After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a National Coalition government.

Fianna Fáil were returned to office after the 1977 general election. Brennan was elected Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, a position he held until his death in 1980, aged 67.

The by-election for his seat in the Donegal constituency was held on 6 November 1980, and won by the Fianna Fáil candidate Clement Coughlan.

He was president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland between 1934 and 1938.

<text>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company ( ; HMH) is an American publisher of textbooks, instructional technology materials, assessments, and reference works. The company is based in the Boston Financial District. It was formerly known as Houghton Mifflin Company, but it changed its name following the 2007 acquisition of Harcourt Publishing. Prior to March 2010, it was a subsidiary of Education Media and Publishing Group Limited, an Irish-owned holding company registered in the Cayman Islands and formerly known as Riverdeep. In 2022, it was acquired by Veritas Capital, a New York-based private-equity firm.

== Company history==
=== Ticknor and Allen, 1832 ===
In 1832, William Ticknor and John Allen purchased a bookselling business in Boston and began to involve themselves in publishing; James T. Fields joined as a partner in 1843. Fields and Ticknor gradually gathered an impressive list of writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. The duo formed a close relationship with Riverside Press, a Boston printing company owned by Henry Oscar Houghton. Houghton also founded his own publishing company with partner Melancthon Hurd in 1864, with George H. Mifflin joining the partnership in 1872.

In 1878, Ticknor and Fields, now under the leadership of James R. Osgood, found itself in financial difficulties and merged its operations with Hurd and Houghton. The new partnership, named Houghton, Osgood and Company, and based in Boston&#x27;s Winthrop Square, held the rights to the literary works of both publishers. When Osgood left the firm two years later, the business reemerged as Houghton, Mifflin and Company. Despite a lucrative partnership with Lawson Valentine, Houghton, Mifflin and Company still had debt it had inherited from Ticknor and Fields, so it decided to add partners. In 1884, James D. Hurd, the son of Melancthon Hurd, became a partner. In 1888, three others became partners as well: James Murray Kay, Thurlow Weed Barnes, and Henry Oscar Houghton Jr.

Shortly thereafter, the company established an Educational Department, and from 1891 to 1908, sales of educational materials increased by 500 percent. The firm incorporated in 1908, changing its name to Houghton Mifflin Company. Soon after 1916, Houghton Mifflin became involved in publishing standardized tests and testing materials, working closely with such test developers as E. F. Lindquist. By 1921, the company was the fourth-largest educational publisher in the United States.

In 1961, Houghton Mifflin famously passed on Julia Child&#x27;s &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot;, giving it up to Alfred A. Knopf who published it in 1962. It became an overnight success, and is considered by many to be the bible of French cooking. Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s strategic error was depicted in the 2009 film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;.

In 1967, Houghton Mifflin became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol &quot;HTN&quot;.

In 1979, Houghton Mifflin acquired the complete catalog of &quot;Parnassus Press&quot;, a Berkeley, California small press, established in 1957 by Herman Schein, the husband of writer-illustrator Ruth Robbins. Works by authors included: Ursula K. Le Guin, Theodora Kroeber, Nicolas Sidjakov, Edward Ormondroyd, Charlotte Zolotow, Anne B. Fisher, Allen Say, Beverly Cleary, Crawford Kilian, Adrien Stoutenburg, and Sam DeWitt. In 1979, Houghton Mifflin acquired Clarion Books, the children&#x27;s division of Seabury Press. In 1980, Houghton Mifflin acquired the educational publishing operations of Rand McNally.

Under (new from 1991) president Nader F. Darehshori Houghton Mifflin acquired McDougal Littell in 1994, for $138 million, an educational publisher of secondary school materials, and the following year acquired D.C. Heath and Company, a publisher of supplemental educational resources. In 1995, HMH acquired Chapters Publishing, a publisher of cooking, garden, and craft titles. In 1996, HMH created their Great Source Education Group to combine the supplemental material product lines of their School Division, McDougal Littell, and Heath.

In 1998, HMH announced a sub-brand called LOGAL Software, which was to release a new line of interactive science software called &quot;Science Gateways&quot;, to support the United States curriculum. As of 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is offering the &quot;Logal Science&quot; brand as a licensing opportunity on its website.

In 2017, it was announced that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt would be getting involved in TV production with a planned 2019 Netflix series that will revive the &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; franchise.

===Mergers and acquisitions activities, 2001– ===
Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activities have had major effects on this company.

====Vivendi purchase====
In 2001, Houghton Mifflin was acquired by French media giant Vivendi Universal for $2.2 billion, including assumed debt. Vivendi Universal already owned the British children&#x27;s publisher Kingfisher, which became a Houghton Mifflin imprint. In 2002, facing mounting financial and legal pressures, Vivendi sold Houghton to private equity investors Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital, and Blackstone Group for $1.66 billion, including assumed debt (approximately 25% less than Vivendi had paid a year earlier).

====Riverdeep merger with Houghton Mifflin====
On December 22, 2006, it was announced that Riverdeep PLC had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin. The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group. Riverdeep paid $1.75 billion in cash and assumed $1.61 billion in debt from the private investment firms Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital, and Blackstone Group. Tony Lucki, a former non-executive director of Riverdeep, remained in his position as the company&#x27;s chief executive officer until April 2009.

Houghton Mifflin sold its professional testing unit, Promissor, to Pearson plc in 2006. The company combined its remaining assessment products within Riverside Publishing, including San Francisco-based Edusoft.

====Harcourt merger====

On July 16, 2007, Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Harcourt Education, Harcourt Trade, and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions of Reed Elsevier for $4 billion. The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. McDougal Littell was merged with Harcourt&#x27;s Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston to form Holt McDougal.

In October 2007, Houghton Mifflin sold Kingfisher to Macmillan Publishers.

On December 3, 2007, Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) announced that it had agreed to acquire the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750 million, pending regulatory approval.

On November 25, 2008, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced a temporary freeze on acquisition of new trade division titles, allegedly in response to the economic crisis of 2008. The publisher of the trade division resigned, apparently in protest. Many observers familiar with the publishing industry saw the move as a devastating blunder.

Harcourt Religion was sold to Our Sunday Visitor in 2009.

====Houghton Mifflin Harcourt restructuring====
On July 27, 2009, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper reported that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&#x27;s controlling shareholder EMPG was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. As a result, the royal family of Dubai via their Istithmar World Capital investment vehicle became major stakeholders. Estimates were that EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On August 15, 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&#x27;s CEO at the time, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 percent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility.

====Second round restructuring====
A further restructuring of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&#x27;s debts was confirmed by the company on January 13, 2010. The proposed restructuring materially impacted the shareholders of EMPG, the former holding company of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

====Recapitalization in 2010====
On February 22, 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalize its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.

The agreement, supported by 100% of HMH&#x27;s creditors, highlighted a reduction in the senior debt to $3 billion from the current $5 billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including Paulson &amp; Co. and Guggenheim Partners), conversion of the $2 billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity. In addition to the key highlights, HMH announced its new $100m Innovation Fund, to invest in the next generation of technology for the education industry.

The &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported that the investments by the then equity holders of EMPG, including HMH&#x27;s CEO at the time, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan, private clients of Davy Stockbrokers, Reed Elsevier, and others of over $3.5 billion would be written down to zero. Additionally, the Irish Independent reported that following the restructuring, the investors of EMPG would have a nominal investment in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt via warrants over 5% of the company if it exceeded the $10 billion valuation placed on the company at the time of the merger between Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep and Harcourt. In addition to the warrants in HMH, the EMPG shareholders would continue to own a stake in the international investment vehicle, EMPGI which has stakes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that no management changes were expected as part of the deal with both the CEO at the time, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan and the CFO, Michael Muldowney expected to remain in their roles. The Times reported that a new nine-member board was to be created with the CEO the only executive representative, one independent, two representative of Paulson &amp; Co, and one director from each of Apollo, BlackRock, Guggenheim Partners, Fidelity and Avenue Capital.

On March 10, 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it had completed its re-capitalization. In addition to a new investment of $650 million of equity, the debt levels of the company were reduced by approximately 60% and the annual interest payments by over 75%. According to the Irish State Broadcaster, RTÉ, the old equity investors based in Ireland has lost all their investment. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported that the old shareholders were denied a shareholders meeting to vote or discuss the restructuring. The former shareholders have been left with warrants over 5% of the company, in the case its value recovers to previous levels.

On September 19, 2011, it was announced that Linda K. Zecher would be replacing Barry O&#x27;Callahan as chief executive officer and Director of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt after O&#x27;Callahan resigned. In July 2012, Zecher detailed her plans for post-bankruptcy to D.C. Denison at The Boston Globe. Zecher went to HMH from Microsoft.

In 2012, HMH acquired the culinary and reference portfolio of John Wiley &amp; Sons, including CliffsNotes and &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot;.

HMH went public in November 2013.

In 2014, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sponsored Curious George (TV series) on PBS Kids replacing Chuck E. Cheese.

On May 13, 2014, HMH bought Channel One News. In 2015, Houghton Mifflin struggled to find a charity that would accept royalties for &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; by Adolf Hitler.

On February 15, 2017, John J. (&quot;Jack&quot;) Lynch Jr., the former CEO of Renaissance Learning, was named the new CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

In 2018, HMH sold its Steck-Vaughn adult education titles to Paxen Publishing and its Riverside test publishing subsidiary to Alpine Investments.

In April 2023, HMH acquired NWEA, a not-for-profit academic assessment company.

====Sale of publishing assets to HarperCollins====
On March 29, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that HarperCollins, a division of American mass media and publishing company News Corp, had reached a deal to buy HMH Books &amp; Media for US$349 million. The sale includes HMH&#x27;s trade publishing division and computer video game franchises such as &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; and &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. The deal would allow HMH to pay down its debt so it could further its digital-first strategy in educational publishing. The deal was completed on May 10.

====Acquisition by Veritas Capital====
On February 22, 2022, a tender offer was announced by Veritas Capital to acquire HMH at a price of $21 per share, or about $2.8 Billion. The tender deadline was originally April 1, before being extended to April 6 on March 29. Prior to the tender date, the stock generated a lot of hype on internet forum WallStreetBets, with over 36,000 contracts traded for the June 17 $22.5 strike price call options. Many investors purchased call options based on numerous reports from institutional investors with large stakes in the company, claiming that the $21 per share offer was undervaluing the company. On April 6, 57% of $HMHC shares were put up for tender, leading to the tender offer going through and HMH going private. Once the sale was completed, the stock of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt was delisted from Nasdaq.

==Leadership changes==

On September 22, 2016, Zecher resigned from HMH and was replaced by Interim CEO and Board Member L. Gordon Crovitz. Crovitz is a former publisher of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. On February 15, 2017, John J. &quot;Jack&quot; Lynch Jr., the former CEO of Renaissance Learning, was named the new CEO of HMH.

Lynch brought former employee Jim O&#x27;Neill back to the company to lead the core division as GM and EVP.

<text>Barbara Novak Marshall (March 5, 1944 – February 22, 2009) was an American television broadcast journalist and politician. She was elected three times to the Honolulu City Council in Honolulu, Hawaii following her retirement from broadcasting.

Marshall was known throughout Hawaii for a long career as an investigative journalist, consumer advocate, documentary filmmaker, news anchor and reporter for KHON-TV television station.

==Biography==
Born Barbara Novak in Berwyn, Illinois she went on to become the first female graduate of the Radio and Television Journalism program at the University of Illinois in 1965. As Barbara Novak, she broke through television journalism&#x27;s glass ceiling to become the first woman Radio-TV grad to anchor a regularly scheduled broadcast television news program in the United States. She rose to further prominence as Barbara Marshall in Boston, where she worked for a decade as an award-winning reporter for two Boston television stations, first for channel 56 WLVI and then for channel 4 WBZ-TV. A number of her interviews and stories were broadcast on NBC-TV network newscasts.

Marshall transported her career to Honolulu in 1979, working for 23 years as reporter, news anchor and producer for channel 2 KHON. During her tenure at KHON, Marshall initiated Action Line (a TV-consumer complaint line), live television election coverage and created the first morning news program in Hawaii. She won awards for two documentaries: One on the eruption of the Kilauea volcano, and another on the life of Challenger astronaut Ellison Onizuka. 

In 2002, she won a seat on the Honolulu City Council in her first attempt at elective office. She was reelected to the council seat on September 18, 2004 and again on September 25, 2008 and was elected chairman by her peers on January 2, 2007.

==Personal==
Marshall died on February 22, 2009, aged 64, after an eight-month battle with colon cancer. Marshall&#x27;s husband, Cliff Ziems, endorsed her aide, Ikaika Anderson, to fill her city council seat; he was elected in a special election and was sworn into office on May 27, 2009.

<text>Timothy James Carrington Foster, MBE (born 19 January 1970) is an English rower who won a gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

==Career==
He began rowing at Bedford Modern School and competed in the World Rowing Junior Championships in 1987 and 1988. In the latter he competed in a pair with Matthew Pinsent. He became the first British rower to win gold medals at two consecutive Junior Worlds. From there he proceeded into the senior squad.

In 1993 he underwent back surgery but was straight back in the boat for the 1994 season, winning Bronze in the coxless four at the World Championships. This boat stayed together until the 1996 Olympics, where they won Bronze.

Following his Olympic medal, he continued his university studies at Oxford, competing in the 1997 Boat Race.

In 1997 he won a seat in the coxless four alongside Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell. In the run up to the Olympics, he again needed back surgery and time off after severing tendons in his hand by punching a window at a boat club party. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, a three-part BBC documentary entitled &quot;Gold Fever&quot; was broadcast. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in the quest for gold. Despite the problems Foster had had, he was in the final crew and they won the gold medal at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. He was awarded an MBE for his part in this in 2001.

After Sydney, he retired from international rowing, and retired as an active rower in July 2001. After a stint coaching at the University of London Boat Club, he joined the UK Sport-sponsored Elite Coach Programme in 2004. In January 2007, he became the head coach of the Swiss national rowing squad. He remained in this role until 2012, and now works as a business coach.

==Personal life==
At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Foster proposed to Joy Fahrenkrog, a four-time member of the United States Archery Team. The pair met in 2000 while Joy was studying at the London School of Economics and rowing for the University of London Boat Club. His brother Jason was the team manager for the England Rowing Team and head of rowing at George Watson&#x27;s College, Edinburgh.

<text>Bronisław Knaster (22 May 1893 – 3 November 1980) was a Polish mathematician; from 1939 a university professor in Lwów and from 1945 in Wrocław.

In 1945, he completed a project in collaboration with Karol Borsuk and Kazimierz Kuratowski concerning the establishment of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

He is known for his work in point-set topology and in particular for his discoveries in 1922 of the hereditarily indecomposable continuum or pseudo-arc and of the Knaster continuum, or buckethandle continuum. Together with his teacher Hugo Steinhaus and his colleague Stefan Banach, he also developed the last diminisher procedure for fair cake cutting.

Knaster received his Ph.D. degree from University of Warsaw in 1922 under the supervision of Stefan Mazurkiewicz.

<doc id="1003142" wikidata="Q270837" url="?curid=1003142" title="Tsitsi Dangarembga">
<text>Tsitsi Dangarembga (born 4 February 1959) is a Zimbabwean novelist, playwright and filmmaker. Her debut novel, &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; (1988), which was the first to be published in English by a Black woman from Zimbabwe, was named by the BBC in 2018 as one of the top 100 books that have shaped the world. She has won other literary honours, including the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize and the PEN Pinter Prize. In 2020, her novel &quot;This Mournable Body&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 2022, Dangarembga was convicted in a Zimbabwe court of inciting public violence, by displaying, on a public road, a placard asking for reform.

== Early life and education ==

Tsitsi Dangarembga was born on 4 February 1959 in Mutoko, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), a small town where her parents taught at the nearby mission school. Her mother, Susan Dangarembga, was the first black woman in Southern Rhodesia to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and her father, Amon, would later become a school headmaster. From the ages of two to six, Dangarembga lived in England, while her parents pursued higher education. There, as she has recalled, she and her brother began to speak English &quot;as a matter of course and forgot most of the Shona we had learnt.&quot; She returned to Rhodesia with her family in 1965, the year of the colony&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence. In Rhodesia, she reacquired Shona, but considered English, the language of her schooling, her first language.

In 1965, she moved with her family to Old Mutare, a Methodist mission near Umtali (now Mutare) where her father and mother took up respective positions as headmaster and teacher at Hartzell High School. Dangarembga, who had begun her education in England, enrolled at Hartzell Primary School, before going to board at the Marymount Mission convent school. She completed her A-Levels at Arundel School, an elite, predominantly white girls&#x27; school in the capital, Salisbury (today Harare), and in 1977 went to the University of Cambridge to study medicine at Sidney Sussex College. There, she experienced racism and isolation and left after three years, returning in 1980 to Zimbabwe several months before the country&#x27;s independence.

Dangarembga worked briefly as a teacher, before taking up studies in medicine and psychology at the University of Zimbabwe while working for two years as a copywriter at a marketing agency. She joined the university drama club, and wrote and directed several of the plays the group performed. She also became involved with the theatre group Zambuko, during which she participated in the production of two plays, &quot;Katshaa!&quot; and &quot;Mavambo&quot;. She later recalled, &quot;There were simply no plays with roles for black women, or at least we didn&#x27;t have access to them at the time. The writers in Zimbabwe were basically men at the time. And so I really didn&#x27;t see that the situation would be remedied unless some women sat down and wrote something, so that&#x27;s what I did!&quot; She wrote three plays during this period: &quot;Lost of the Soil&quot; (1983), &quot;She No Longer Weeps&quot;, and &quot;The Third One&quot;. During these years, she also began reading works by African-American women writers and contemporary African literature, a shift from the English classics she had grown up reading.

== Career ==
===1980s and 1990s===
In 1985, Dangarembga&#x27;s short story &quot;The Letter&quot; won second place in a writing competition arranged by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and was published in Sweden in the anthology &quot;Whispering Land&quot;. In 1987, her play &quot;She No Longer Weeps&quot;, which she wrote during her university years, was published in Harare. Her first novel, &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;, was published in 1988 in the United Kingdom, and a year later in the United States. She wrote it in 1985, but experienced difficulties getting it published; rejected by four Zimbabwean publishers, she eventually found a willing publisher in the London-based Women&#x27;s Press. &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;, the first novel written in English by a black woman from Zimbabwe, received domestic and international acclaim, and was awarded the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize (Africa region) in 1989. Her work is included in the 1992 anthology &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby. &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; is considered one of the best African novels ever written, and was included on the BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of top 100 books that have shaped the world.

In 1989, Dangarembga went to Germany to study film direction at the German Film and Television Academy Berlin. She produced a number of films while in Berlin, including a documentary aired on German television. In 1992, she founded Nyerai Films, a production company based in Harare. She wrote the story for the film &quot;Neria&quot;, made in 1991, which became the highest-grossing film in Zimbabwean history. Her 1996 film &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Child&quot;, the first feature film directed by a black Zimbabwean woman, was shown internationally, including at the Dublin International Film Festival. The film, shot on location in Harare and Domboshava, follows the tragic stories of four siblings after their parents die of AIDS.

===2000 onwards===
In 2000, Dangarembga moved back to Zimbabwe with her family, and continued her work with Nyerai Films. In 2002, she founded the International Images Film Festival. Her 2005 film &quot;Kare Kare Zvako&quot; won the Short Film Award and Golden Dhow at the Zanzibar International Film Festival, and the African Short Film Award at the Milan Film Festival. Her 2006 film &quot;Peretera Maneta&quot; received the UNESCO Children&#x27;s and Human Rights Award and won the Zanzibar International Film Festival. She is the executive director of the organization Women Filmmakers of Zimbabwe and the founding director of the International Images Film Festival for Women of Harare (IIFF). As of 2010, she has also served on the board of the Zimbabwe College of Music for five years, including two years as chair. She is a founding member of the Institute for Creative Arts for Progress for Creative Arts in Africa (ICAPA).

Asked about her lack of writing since &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;, Dangarembga explained in 2004: &quot;firstly, the novel was published only after I had turned to film as a medium; secondly, Virginia Woolf&#x27;s shrewd observation that a woman needs £500 and a room of her own in order to write is entirely valid. Incidentally, I am moving and hope that, for the first time since &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;, I shall have a room of my own. I&#x27;ll try to ignore the bit about £500.&quot; Indeed, two years later in 2006, she published her second novel, &quot;The Book of Not&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;. She also became involved in politics, and in 2010 was named education secretary of the Movement for Democratic Change political party led by Arthur Mutambara. She cited her background coming from a family of educators, her brief stint as a teacher, and her &quot;practical, if not formal,&quot; involvement in the education sector as preparing her for the role. She completed doctoral studies in African studies at Humboldt University of Berlin, and wrote her PhD thesis on the reception of African film.

She was a judge for the 2014 Etisalat Prize for Literature. In 2016, she was selected by the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center for their Artists in Residency program. Her third novel, &quot;This Mournable Body&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Book of Not&quot; and &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;, was published in 2018 by Graywolf Press in the US, and in the UK by Faber and Faber in 2020, described by Alexandra Fuller in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;another masterpiece&quot; and by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;magnificent ... another classic&quot; &quot;This Mournable Body&quot; was one of the six novels shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize, chosen from 162 submissions.

In an interview with Bhakti Shringarpure for &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine, Dangaremgba discussed the rationale behind her novels: &quot;My first publisher, the late Ros de Lanerolle, asked me to write a sequel to &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot;. Writing the sequel, I realized the second book would deal only with the middle part of the protagonist&#x27;s life. ... [and] offered no answers to the questions raised in &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; concerning how life with any degree of agency is possible for such people. ... I was captivated by the idea of writing a trilogy about a very ordinary person who starts off as an impoverished rural girl in colonial Rhodesia and has to try to build a meaningful life for herself. The form has also allowed me to engage with some aspects of Zimbabwe&#x27;s national development from a personal rather than a political angle.&quot;

In 2019, Dangarembga was announced as a finalist for the St. Francis College Literary Prize, a biennial award recognizing outstanding fiction by writers in the middle stages of their careers, which was eventually won that year by Samantha Hunt.

On 31 July 2020 Dangarembga was arrested in Harare, Zimbabwe, ahead of anti-corruption protests. Later that year she was on the list of the BBC&#x27;s 100 Women announced on 23 November 2020.

In September 2020, Dangarembga was announced as the University of East Anglia&#x27;s inaugural International Chair of Creative Writing, from 2021 to 2022.

Dangarembga won the 2021 PEN International Award for Freedom of Expression, given annually since 2005 to honour writers who continue working despite being persecuted for their writing.

In June 2021, it was announced that Dangarembga would be the recipient of the prestigious 2021 Peace Prize awarded by the German book publishers and booksellers association, making her the first black woman to be honoured with the award since it was inaugurated in 1950.

In July 2021, she was elected to honorary Fellowship of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.

Dangarembga was chosen by English PEN as winner of the 2021 PEN Pinter Prize, awarded annually to a writer who, in the words spoken by Harold Pinter on receiving his Nobel Prize for Literature, casts an &quot;unflinching, unswerving&quot; gaze upon the world and shows a &quot;fierce intellectual determination... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies&quot;. In her acceptance speech at the British Library on 11 October 2021, Dangarembga named the Ugandan novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija as the International Writer of Courage Award.

In 2022, Dangarembga was selected to receive a Windham-Campbell Literature Prize for fiction.

In June 2022, an arrest warrant was issued against Tsitsi Dangarembga. She was prosecuted for incitement to public violence and violation of anti-Covid rules after an anti-government demonstration organized at the end of July 2020.

On 28 September 2022, Dangarembga was officially convicted of promoting public violence after she and her friend, Julie Barnes, walked around Harare in a peaceful protest while holding placards that read “We Want Better. Reform Our Institutions”. Dangarembga was given a $110 fine and a suspended six-month jail sentence. She announced that she planned to appeal her verdict amid human rights groups claiming that her prosecution was a direct result of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s attempts to “silence opposition in the long-troubled southern African country”. On 8 May 2023, it was announced that Dangarembga&#x27;s conviction had been overturned after she appealed the initial conviction in 2022.

<doc id="1003148" wikidata="Q2721981" url="?curid=1003148" title="ROYGBIV">
<text>ROYGBIV is an acronym for the sequence of hues commonly described as making up a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When making an artificial rainbow, glass prism is used, but the colors of &quot;ROY-G-BIV&quot; are inverted to &quot;VIB-G-YOR&quot;. There are several mnemonics that can be used for remembering this color sequence, such as the name &quot;Roy G. Biv&quot; or sentences such as &quot;Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain&quot;.

==History==

In the Renaissance, several artists tried to establish a sequence of up to seven primary colors from which all other colors could be mixed. In line with this artistic tradition, Sir Isaac Newton divided his color circle, which he constructed to explain additive color mixing, into seven colors. Originally he used only five colors, but later he added orange and indigo to match the number of musical notes in the major scale.

The Munsell color system, the first formal color notation system (1905), names only five &quot;principal hues&quot;: red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

==Mnemonics==
Isaac Newton&#x27;s color sequence (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) is kept alive today by several popular mnemonics. One is simply the nonsense word &quot;roygbiv&quot;, which is an acronym for the seven colors. This word can also be envisioned as a person&#x27;s name, &quot;Roy G. Biv&quot;.

Another traditional mnemonic device has been to turn the initial letters of the seven spectral colors into a sentence, most commonly &quot;Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain&quot; (or the slight alternative &quot;Richard Of York Gained Battles In Vain&quot;). This mnemonic is said to refer to the defeat and death of Richard, Duke of York at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, or to his son Richard III being defeated at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Another sentence sometimes used is &quot;Read Out Your Good Book In Verse&quot;, referring to the Bible.

==In popular culture==
The mnemonic sentence &quot;Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain&quot;, mentioned above, also appears in the 2003 novel &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot;, third book of the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series.

The song &quot;Roygbiv&quot; by Scottish electronic band Boards of Canada is named for the mnemonic.

<text>The gang system is a system of division of labor within slavery on a plantation. It is the more brutal of two main types of labor systems. The other form, known as the task system, was less harsh and allowed the slaves more self-governance than the gang system did. The gang system allowed continuous work at the same pace throughout the day. The first gang, or &quot;great gang,&quot; was given the hardest work, for the fittest slaves. The second gang was for less able slaves (teenagers, old people, or the unwell slaves) and this gang was given lighter work. The third gang was given the easiest work.

As an example, the planting gang in the McDuffie plantation was split into three classes (as quoted by Metzer):
*The 1st class, consisting of the best workers, &quot;...those of good judgement and quick motion...&quot;
*The 2nd class, who were the most inefficient and weakest.
*The 3rd class, made up of children.

The first class had to go ahead and create small holes with about distance to each other. The second class then dropped cotton seeds in these holes and the 3rd class covered the holes with dirt.

In the United States, the gang system developed in the nineteenth century and is characteristic of the ante-bellum period (c. 1820–1865). It is especially associated with cotton production in the Deep South, but also is associated with tobacco and sugar production. Rice plantations in Carolina, for example, never adopted a gang system of labor. The idea of a gang system is that enslaved workers would work all day (traditionally, from sunrise to sunset) under the supervision of an overseer. Breaks for lunch and dinner were part of the system. This is opposed to the task system, under which the worker is released when his assigned task for the day is completed.

<text>Abraham González de Hermosillo y Casavantes (June 7, 1864 – March 7, 1913) was the provisional and constitutional governor of the Mexican state of Chihuahua during the early period of the Mexican Revolution. He was the political mentor of the revolutionary Pancho Villa, whom he had met and befriended before the revolution.

==Family==
Abraham González de Hermosillo y Casavantes was born on his family&#x27;s estates in Basúchil, in Guerrero Municipality, Chihuahua. He was a member of one of the richest and best-educated families in the state (the González de Hermosillo family was believed to be descended from European nobility). He was educated at the University of Notre Dame, in South Bend, Indiana. His paternal line is from Teocaltiche, Jalisco, belonging to the González de Hermosillo y Gómez Rendón family with Y-DNA matches with other González de Hermosillo families of Jalisco.

As with Francisco Madero, the scion of one of the richest landowning families in Coahuila and also educated abroad, Abraham González had suffered under the favoritism of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s political system. In Chihuahua, the dominant political clique was the Creel-Terrazas family, which had vast land holdings and strong political connections to Díaz. González &quot;was unable to hold out against the competition of the large haciendas, primarily those belonging to the Terrazas-Creel clan.&quot; After Madero wrote his book, &quot;The Presidential Succession of 1910&quot; and the political movement of elites against Díaz&#x27;s election grew, González became the head of the Anti-Re-electionist Club in Chihuahua.

==Political career==
González was one of the main leaders of the Maderista Junta Revolucionaria Mexicana, the movement which opposed the re-election of dictator Porfirio Díaz in 1910. González was president of the Benito Juárez Anti-Re-electionist Club and met with Francisco Madero in Chihuahua. At the time, Madero had not yet chosen his running mate, and when González asked who he preferred, Madero said Francisco Vázquez Gómez. González declared for Vázquez Gómez. When Madero issued his Plan de San Luis Potosí, calling for rebellion against Díaz after the fraudulent 1910 election, he counted on González, among others, to rise up.

During the early phases of the Revolution, González was appointed provisional governor of the State of Chihuahua in October 1910 by Francisco Madero. After the success of the Madero revolution in 1911, González was appointed interim governor in June 1911, pending elections. He was elected governor in his own right in August 1911.

In October 1911, González obtained a leave of absence, approved by the Chihuahua legislature, from the office of governor so that he could serve on Madero&#x27;s cabinet in Mexico City. On November 6, 1911, he was sworn in as the Minister of Internal Affairs (Secretaría de Gobernación). As one of the Madero cabinet ministers who had served in the revolution against Díaz, González was a target of the conservative press. He served in this capacity until February 1912, when he returned to Chihuahua due to the seriousness of the Pascual Orozco rebellion against Madero. He served as governor of the state until his arrest and murder by officials of the Victoriano Huerta regime in March 1913.
==Death==
After the assassination of President Francisco Madero and Vice-President José María Pino Suárez during &quot;La decena trágica&quot;, González was forced to resign from his post as governor and arrested on February 25, 1913, on orders of General Antonio Rábago, a subordinate of Victoriano Huerta. During González&#x27;s incarceration he was held in the same complex in the Federal Palace of Chihuahua that had housed Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla prior to his execution a century earlier, during the war for Mexico&#x27;s independence. On 7 March, he was taken aboard a train on the pretense of being transferred to Mexico City. He was then removed from the train and murdered in Bachimba Canyon, about south of Chihuahua, on direct orders from Huerta, who had been responsible for ordering the murders of Madero and Pino Suárez in order to assume power.

His nephew, Colonel Fernando González y González, along with Pancho Villa, later recovered González&#x27;s remains and gave him a hero&#x27;s funeral in the city of Chihuahua. He is buried in the Rotunda of Illustrious Chihuahuans under the Angel of Liberty monument in the Plaza Mayor in Chihuahua City.

<text>Ungeküsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn () is a 1936 Austrian comedy film. The screenplay was written by Fritz Koselka, the title song was composed by Robert Stolz, and the film was directed by E. W. Emo. The film, shot in black and white, starred the three most popular German-speaking comedians of the time—Heinz Rühmann, Hans Moser, and Theo Lingen. The leading roles were played by Liane Haid and Annie Rosar.

==Plot==
Celebrated singer and actress Edda Vivian (Haid), who has secretly married her lover, Prince Alba (Iván Petrovich), has arrived in Vienna as part of a promotional tour. Her manager, Toni Miller (Lingen), who is completely unaware of her married state and the husband she is hiding in her hotel suite, has arranged a publicity stunt—an auction to be held at a ball where Edda Vivian is supposed to give a kiss to the highest bidder, with the money to be given to charity.

At the same time Franz Angerer (Rühmann), a student of philology, arrives in Vienna, where he wants to attend a conference. He is put up by his Uncle Ferdinand (Karl Hellmer), who works as a butler for Direktor Wiesinger (Moser in rather an unusual role), the owner of a record company.

In the course of the action Angerer is mistaken for several other people, in particular Prince Alba. However, he only has eyes for Wiesinger&#x27;s daughter, Dore (Susi Lanner). The happy ending consists in the real Prince Alba showing himself to the public together with his wife Edda Vivian, and in Franz Angerer, who by his wit has made her sign an exclusive contract with Wiesinger&#x27;s company, becoming engaged to Dore.

<doc id="1003178" wikidata="Q6525874" url="?curid=1003178" title="Leonard Zhakata">
<text>Leonard &quot;Karikoga&quot; Zhakata (born 
25 June 1968) is a Zimbabwean musician and singer. He writes and sings mainly in his native Shona tongue. Zhakata, who adorns trademark glittering outfits, is best known for his hits &quot;Hupenyu Mutoro&quot;, &quot;Batai Mazwi&quot; and &quot;Gomba Remarara&quot;. However, it was his 1994 smash hit &quot;Mugove&quot;, from the album &quot;Maruva Enyika&quot;, which evaded government censorship
and propelled him to national stardom.

==Background==
He started writing his first song in 1986 and was a member of SUNGURA BOYS; Simon Chimbetu, Nicholas Zakariah, John Chibadura, Daiton Somanje, and Leonard Dembo were all part of the SUNGURA BOYS. From the group Zhakata split with his nephew Thomas Makion to create Maungwe Brothers. Simon Chimbetu split with his brothers Brian and Naison Chimbetu to create Dendera Kings. Nicholas Zakariah split to create Khiama Boys. Leonard Dembo went solo as well as Daiton Somanje.

In 1994 at the age of 26, he became the youngest Zimbabwean musician to sell more than 100,000 copies of an album, when his solo album &quot;Maruva Enyika&quot; sold more than 120,000 copies.

In 2006, Zhakata spoke out about the government and asked for the radio waves to be freed to allow Zimbabweans to operate radio stations. Some of his music is blacklisted by the government and banned on state radio due to perceived political statements.

Zhakata is a qualified Fitter and Turner and the only boy in a family of seven. Leonard Zhakata used to sneak from home and play music with his primary school mates. Then at Shiri Yedenga School in Glen Norah, Harare, at the age of thirteen, he had his first music composition &quot;Baba vaSamson&quot;. Pursuing school and later serving for an apprenticeship, it took Leonard sometime before he could record. After, the frustration of being turned down by recording companies, he had his lucky break and recorded his first 12-inch entitled &quot;Moyo muti&quot; sometime in 1989, to be followed by an album &quot;Yarira Mhera &quot;in 1990.

Zhakata&#x27;s songwriting skills continued to rise with the releases of chart busting songs such as &#x27;Tungidza Gwenya&#x27; and &#x27;Shungu dzemwoyo&#x27;. He however seemed to remain in the mediocre periphery of &quot;Who is Who&quot; on the Zimbabwean music scene, until the release of his mega chartbusting album Maruva Enyika with hit song Mugove in 1994. Backed by a very tight musical outfit, The Zimbabwean All Stars Band and a well choreographed dance display, this album set Zimbabwe on fire during the festive season of the same year. No party was complete without &quot;Mugove&quot; being played. Those who had doubted Zhakata&#x27;s music mastery had to think again. All albums that followed thereafter Nzombe Huru, Vagoni Vebasa, and three others, established Zhakata within the Zimbabwean music household.

Zhakata nicknamed himself Karikoga, a word that means &quot;Loner.&quot; This nickname appears to stem from the poverty he endured as a lone child. In fact, many of his albums have included at least one song dedicated to the suffering masses as well as to people whose upbringing was full of mishaps.

<doc id="1003180" wikidata="Q2745103" url="?curid=1003180" title="Armstrong, British Columbia">
<text>Armstrong is a city in the North Okanagan of the Canadian province of British Columbia, between Vernon and Enderby. It overlooks the Spallumcheen Valley, which forms a broad pass between the Okanagan Valley to the south and the Shuswap Country to the north, and is about from each of Vancouver, B.C. and Spokane, Washington. The City of Armstrong celebrated its centennial in 2013.

== Location and history ==
Armstrong is a rural community and commercial center in the North Okanagan, with agriculture, grain farming of alfalfa and corn, logging, and ranching being traditional economic activities. It is located amidst the dairy and farmlands of the Spallumcheen Valley (a name derived from a Shuswap language word with multiple meanings: &quot;beautiful valley&quot;, &quot;flat meadow&quot;, &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;, and &quot;prairie-banked river&quot;).

Armstrong was named after William Heaton Armstrong, a London banker who helped finance the Shuswap and Okanagan Railway in 1892 and local development at the turn of the century, relocating the townsite originally at Landsdowne to the confluence of the Valley&#x27;s rail lines and the city&#x27;s current site.

The influence of Dutch immigrants settling in the valley after the Second World War is represented by their cheese-making knowledge, allowing Armstrong to become well known for the cheese it produced.

The city is also well known for hosting the Interior Provincial Exhibition and Stampede, which has been in annual operation since 1899 though the event was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The &quot;IPE&quot; is not just a midway and popular retail show, but very much still a country fair, with contests being held to judge animals, cooking, sewing, hobbies, and other items. Additionally, the exhibition offers a variety of entertainment options ranging from concerts, competitions, and the famous mini-chuckwagon races.

Armstrong is a corporation operated by a seven-member city council headed by the Mayor, with meetings being held the second and fourth Mondays of every month. The Mayor is Chris Pieper, currently in his second term as mayor. 

Armstrong has four public education facilities; two elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school. Armstrong Elementary School was initially known as the &quot;Armstrong Spallumcheen Consolidated School&quot;. When it was built in 1921, it was the first school in the Province to be constructed as a central school into which were consolidated approximately thirteen small country or one-room schools. Len Wood Middle school and Pleasant Valley Secondary were later added to suit the growing region, with Highland Park Elementary opening in 1983 to satisfy increasing demand and lack of suitable expansion capacity at Armstrong Elementary. There is also a store-front style facility, Gateway Continuing Education Centre, operated by School District 83.

== Economy, tourist attractions, and activities ==
While agriculture, logging, and ranching remain a dominant portion of the economy of Armstrong and the Spallumcheen Valley, tourism increasingly plays a significant role in the economic activity of the area; particularly popular with long-distance cyclists as a desirable location for short-haul excursions.

=== Museums and places of interest ===

Armstrong and the surrounding area feature many attractions including museums, golf courses, water sports, snow sports including skiing and snowmobile riding, boating, fishing and hiking trails.
* The Armstrong-Spallumcheen Museum and Art Gallery, which is the site of the old Armstrong Machine Shop, has over thirty historical displays, replicas of the railways, a schoolhouse, a grocery store, a blacksmith shop, and a comprehensive archive of photographs, newspapers and maps.
* The Old School House is one of the original educational institutions in British Columbia.
* The Caravan Farm Theatre is where professional actors who have long provided entertainment throughout the Okanagan produce a number of annual events and festivals.
* Skiing and snowboarding: the Silver Star Mountain Resort is the most popular winter attraction area in the Okanagan Valley, with close proximity to Armstrong. Skiers and snowboarders take advantage of Silver Star Mountain where they have 2,491 feet (760 m) of vertical drop in which to defy gravity. Cross-country skiers also have a venue at Silver Star with 37 kilometers of tracked and groomed trails. In addition, there are 50 km of groomed trails that pass through the adjacent Sovereign Lake area.

<text>Everyone&#x27;s Child is a 1995 film directed by author Tsitsi Dangarembga who became the first black Zimbabwean woman to direct a feature film. The script is based on the 1989 novel &quot;Harvest of Thorns&quot; by Shimmer Chinodya and stars Elijah Madzikatire, Momsa Mlambo, and Walter Maparutsa. Produced by Zimbabwe&#x27;s Media for Development Trust (MFD), &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Child&quot; was originally conceived as a training video for community-based orphan care programs. Given the explosive growth of AIDS orphans on the continent--at the time of the project&#x27;s development, predicted to reach 10,000,000 by the year 2000--it was determined that a feature film would have more of an impact in building awareness on the issue.

The soundtrack features 12 original songs by some of Zimbabwe&#x27;s most popular musicians at the time, including Thomas Mapfumo, Leonard Zhakata and Andy &quot;Tomato Sauce&quot; Brown. 

The film was criticised for unusual accents and for unsubtle story telling while the soundtrack received positive reviews. 

==Plot==
Focusing on the growing problem of children living in hardship - especially as a result of AIDS - the film follows the abrupt journey of two children into a world of adult responsibility. Itayi and Tamari are devastated following the death of both parents, shunned by family and friends, and left with nothing. Frustrated and in despair, Itayi tries his luck in the big city, leaving Tamari at home to look after herself and her younger brothers and sisters.

<text>Soundtrack to War is a 90-minute documentary by Australian war artist George Gittoes. Filmed throughout 2003–2004, Gittoes bypassed the U.S. military&#x27;s media lockdown on the war in Iraq to capture an authentic account of the human experience of the war. Gittoes interviewed American soldiers deployed in Iraq to create an account of the role of music in the contemporary battlefield. The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;Rampage&quot;.

Songs featured in the movie include Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Angel of Death&quot; and Drowning Pool&#x27;s &quot;Bodies&quot;, as well as freestyle rap and gospel choirs. Seventeen of the early-filmed scenes from the documentary were used in Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

The film is mentioned in the 2009 book &quot;Sound Targets: American Soldiers and Music in the Iraq War&quot; by Jonathan Pieslak.

<text>George Noel Gittoes, (born 7 December 1949) is an Australian artist, film producer, director and writer. In 1970, he was a founder of the Yellow House Artist Collective in Sydney. After the Yellow House finished, he established himself in Bundeena and since then has produced a large and varied output of drawings, paintings, films, and writings. Gittoes’ work has consistently expressed his social, political and humanitarian concern at the effects of injustice and conflict. Until the mid-1980s, this work was chiefly done in Australia. But in 1986 he travelled to Nicaragua, and since then the focus of Gittoes’ work has been largely international. He has travelled to and worked in many regions of conflict, including the Philippines, Somalia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Bougainville, and South Africa. In recent years his work has especially centred on the Middle East, with repeated visits to Israel and Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan. In 2011, he established a new Yellow House, a multidisciplinary arts centre in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Among many prizes, Gittoes has twice been awarded the Blake Prize for Religious Art.

==Early life==
Gittoes was born 1949 in Brighton-le-Sands, New South Wales and grew up in nearby Rockdale, New South Wales, both southern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. Gittoes’ maternal grandfather, who lived in the area, was a semi-professional racehorse trainer, and was a significant influence in Gittoes’ childhood. Gittoes&#x27; father, Claude, was a public servant, who rose to be Secretary of the Department of Main Roads. His mother, Joyce, was an artist and potter. Both parents encouraged George as an artist.
Gittoes completed his schooling at Kingsgrove North High School, and began an Arts degree at Sydney University. However, an encounter with the visiting American art critic Clement Greenberg led to Gittoes&#x27; abandoning his studies in order to spend time in America. Both parents supported this decision, particularly his father. In New York Gittoes came under the influence of the social realist artist, Joe Delaney, whose work was influenced by his involvement in the civil rights movement. Gittoes’ art similarly veered towards the political, and in the US he began the &quot;Hotel Kennedy Suite&quot;, inspired by opposition to the Vietnam War.

==Work in Australia, 1970–1985==

Returning to Australia in late 1969, a meeting with Martin Sharp led to the establishment of the Yellow House Artist Collective near Kings Cross, New South Wales. Gittoes worked with another friend, Bruce Goold, to transform a two-storey building in Macleay Street, Potts Point, into a space in which artists, film-makers and performers could both live and exhibit their work. In an Australia whose culture had been seen by many as stifled and colonial, the Yellow House was a revelation. Gittoes’ own particular contribution was a psychedelic Puppet Theatre, in which he and assistants performed to enthusiastic audiences, using glove puppets Gittoes himself made. In 1971 Gittoes, who regarded his work as fine art and was not completely in sympathy with the counter-cultural communalism of others in the Yellow House, broke away from the group. He had also been very deeply affected by the suicide of his girlfriend, Marie Briebauer. He had met Briebauer in San Francisco, and eventually she followed him to Sydney. But she was facing up to difficult issues with her family, and was not completely accepted by the Yellow House community. Her death was the first great crisis in Gittoes’ life.

A keen surfer, Gittoes travelled for a while in a caravan up and down the south coast of NSW. Eventually he settled in Bundeena, a village between sea and bush south of Sydney. For a time abandoning the politically driven art inspired by Joe Delaney, Gittoes produced a large series of photographs, drawings and paintings, eventually leading to a film, The Rainbow Way.. These images were abstract, using ideas drawn from both Islamic and Aboriginal art (in the latter case, especially the myth of the Rainbow Serpent), but also created out of direct observation of the effects of light underwater. He also experimented for a time with holograms and with computer-generated images. His interest in Aboriginal art and performance, which began with meeting dancers from Mornington Island in 1972, led in 1977 to a trip to the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

Gittoes was keen to bring art and performance to a wide audience. In 1979 he formed the environmental theatre group, Theatre Reaching Environments Everywhere (TREE), with Gabrielle Dalton (whom he married in 1980), Ronaldo Cameron, and Martin Wesley-Smith. Between 1979 and 1984 TREE presented a number of huge theatrical events, mostly on beaches around Sydney, involving hundreds of local people. Gavin Fry has described these as “some of the most complete and spectacular art performances Australia has seen”.

In partnership with Dalton, Gittoes now turned especially to documentary film-making, first with &quot;Tracks of the Rainbow&quot; (1984), a film about Aboriginal children visiting sites of importance to the story of the Rainbow Serpent. Then there were a series of films about life, cultural confrontation, and art in the Northern Territory: &quot;Warriors and lawmen&quot; (1985), &quot;Frontier women&quot; (1985), &quot;Unbroken spirit&quot; (1985), and &quot;Visions in the making&quot;.

==Australia and overseas, 1986–1992==
In 1986, the success of the Northern Territory films led Gittoes overseas, to make &quot;Bullets of the poets&quot; (1987), a film about a group of Sandinista women poets who had fought in the Nicaraguan revolution. This was a turning point for Gittoes. He was influenced by Nicaraguan poet and priest Ernesto Cardenal, whose philosophy of Externalism he later described as follows: “The Externalist poets believed in using real life events and physical experiences in their poetry, instead of the imagery of the imagination. For them reality was more incredible than fantasy.” Gittoes’ key work from this period was the drawing, “The captured gun”, of a half-crippled Sandinista fighter who carried a captured American rifle adapted to use Russian ammunition, which he felt “symbolised that particular phase in the conflict ... and became a major breakthrough in my artistic career.”

In 1989 Gittoes travelled to the Philippines, intending to make a film about women political prisoners. Funding problems prevented the film&#x27;s being made, but again he was brought face to face with victims of conflict, especially between government forces and the dissident New People&#x27;s Army. The resulting works included the Salvage series, documenting the discovery of the body of a torture victim. He also began a long friendship and collaboration with Filipino artist Nune Alvarado. As much as Nicaragua, the Philippines helped shape Gittoes’ future work: “Through my art I can be an advocate for so many people silenced by poverty and the conflicts around them.”

After this, Gittoes worked for a time mainly in Australia, in particular on the series of paintings and drawings, &quot;Heavy Industry&quot;. Initially in 1989 he was invited by the Wollongong Regional Gallery to be artist in residence at the Port Kembla Steelworks in NSW. Between then and 1992 he worked in steelworks, mines, chemical plants, and a Bass Strait oil rig, in Wollongong, Newcastle, Broken Hill, Whyalla, and elsewhere, depicting the men working in these environments sympathetically against a background of industrial decline and difficult and dangerous working conditions. In doing this, he felt he was not only holding true to the Externalist idea of art, but also returning to Joe Delaney&#x27;s view of art “about a historic social struggle exuding pathos and humanity”.

In this period, Gittoes was deeply affected by the death of his friend Ronaldo Cameron, a dancer who had been part of the TREE productions. Gittoes had painted Cameron in the advanced stages of motor neurone disease, and after his death expressed his grief with the painting, &quot;Ancient Prayer&quot;, which in 1992 won the prestigious Blake Prize for Religious Art. In 1993 he won the Wynne Prize for landscape, for &quot;Open Cut&quot;, from the &quot;Heavy Industry&quot; series.

==Peacekeeping and war, 1993–2001==
From 1993, Gittoes’ career took a distinct new direction. Building on his work in Nicaragua and the Philippines, he made a long series of visits to war zones, initially those in which Australian military personnel were serving in multinational peacekeeping operations. Although since World War I Australia had a long tradition of employing official war artists, Gittoes was never a designated Official Artist. Rather, he travelled under the auspices of and generally with the assistance of the Australian army, but remained free to express himself as he wished. On these trips he produced a large body of photographs, drawings and paintings. True to the Externalist tradition, many of the drawings incorporate written texts describing the situations which had inspired them. Many of these works are held by the Australian War Memorial, which had helped facilitate the initial contact with the army. One aspect of Gittoes’ work in this period which differentiates him from most Australian official artists is an enduring interest in and concern for the ways in which the conflict which led to the arrival of the peacekeepers had affected the local people. Gittoes did document the activities of the military personnel he was accompanying, but his vision was also consistently much broader.

The first stop, in March 1993, was Somalia, where Australia had provided a battalion to the American-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF), which was trying on behalf of the United Nations (UN) to restore order to a country devastated by civil war, collapse of government, drought, and famine. Gittoes worked in Mogadishu and in and around Baidoa, the town in south-central Somalia which was the main base of operations for the Australians. Rather than remaining on base, he often accompanied the troops on patrol and when protecting the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Soon afterwards, in May and June 1993, Gittoes visited Australia&#x27;s other major peacekeeping operation at the time, in Cambodia. Cambodia had suffered from American bombing in the Vietnam War, the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of 1975–1979. and long years of civil war between the Vietnam-sponsored government which had ousted the Khmer Rouge and various other factional groupings. Australian diplomatic leadership in achieving a settlement to the conflict under the auspices of the UN meant that the resulting UN operation, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), was led by an Australian, Lieutenant General John Sanderson. Gittoes documented activities of Australian signallers with UNTAC and painted Sanderson&#x27;s portrait, but was also moved in particular by the stoic endurance of the many Cambodian victims of landmines.

In 1994, with support from the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Grey, Gittoes was able to visit Australian peacekeepers in Western Sahara, Egypt, Israel and Lebanon. In Western Sahara he worked with Australian signallers who were part of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Gittoes next went to the Middle East. In Egypt he visited Australian peacekeepers serving with the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), an American-led multinational operation set up in the wake of the Camp David Accords to monitor the Egyptian–Israeli border. In Israel and Lebanon he met Australian military observers serving with the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). Shortly after arriving in Israel he visited the site of the massacre of February 25, 1994, in the Palestinian town of Hebron. What he saw made him doubt the official version that the massacre was the work of a lone gunman, reinforcing his belief in the need for the artist as independent witness and as an advocate for the innocent victims of conflict. In southern Lebanon, then under Israeli occupation, he visited Australian military observers with UNTSO monitoring the border with Israel, but was again moved by the plight of people spending their lives in a conflict zone.

Also in 1994, Gittoes travelled privately to South Africa, to witness the transition to black majority rule and the election on April 27 of Nelson Mandela as president. Mainly working in black townships, his sympathy for black South Africans led to run ins with members of the white supremacist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; on one occasion he was severely beaten up.

Gittoes’ visit to South Africa coincided with the outbreak in Rwanda of the most concentrated genocidal violence of the modern era. In three months between 500,000 and a million Rwandans died. The resulting UN operation, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), included an Australian medical contingent and associated security and support personnel. A year after the original genocide, Gittoes visited the second rotation, once again with support from the Australian Army. By this time the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had won the civil war, and the violence of 1994 had ended. Nevertheless, Gittoes was witness to a tragic epilogue to the original genocide. Huge numbers had been displaced in the 1994 fighting. The largest camp for internally displaced persons was at Kibeho, in south-west Rwanda. The camp held between 80,000 and 100,000 people, many of them no doubt members of the Hutu Interahamwe, which had been central in carrying out the original genocide. In April the Rwandan government announced that the camp would close, surrounded it with soldiers, and began causing panics by firing in the air and burning the refugees’ housing. UNAMIR had a Zambian company at Kibeho, and on 19 April they were joined by 32 Australian medical personnel and infantry, to provide medical treatment and assistance evacuating the refugees. Gittoes, in the country to record the activities of Australian peacekeepers, joined them the next day. Late on April 22 the Rwandan forces began a massacre, using rifles, machine guns, RPGs, bayonets, machetes, and possibly mortars. Next morning the Australians counted 4,000 dead, no doubt fewer than the true number. During the massacre the Australians gave medical treatment to and evacuated as many as they could, all the while witnessing terrible scenes. All were affected by what they saw, Gittoes as much as any. He split his time between helping give direct assistance to individual victims and documenting what was happening. He later flew to New York to report to the UN on what he had seen. But Kibeho also became a powerful catalyst to his art, a subject which still haunted him and which he was still reworking 20 years later.

In 1995 Gittoes won the Blake Prize for religious art a second time, for one of several versions of &quot;The Preacher&quot;, a powerful image of a preacher trying to bring calm to the people around him – and to himself – amidst the chaos and carnage of Kibeho. In 1997 he set up an installation of Rwanda works at &quot;documenta X&quot; in Kassel, Germany. It included ten large confronting 3 v 1.5 m paintings, employing what Gavin Fry describes as “a violent, gut-wrenching expressionism”, to depict the depths of violence and depravity reached at Kibeho; the floor was covered in rags, clothes, and plastic containers. In 2014 he returned yet again to the Rwanda material with a series of “synthages”, combinations of photograph, drawing and painting developed in collaboration with printer John Wesley Mannion.

Gittoes continued to travel to scenes of conflict, but no longer usually with the army. In 1996 he went to Bosnia, where a NATO-led force was gradually restoring order and peace after the devastating Bosnian War which followed the collapse of Yugoslavia. His work, no longer particularly concerned with the peacekeepers, now focused on the plight of refugees and ordinary people living in the midst of devastation. The following year, 1997, he travelled to Northern Ireland at a time when the Northern Ireland peace process was just getting underway, meeting members of both the Irish Republican Army and the Protestant paramilitaries, but again focusing particularly on the lives of those caught up in the conflict. In 1998 he went to China, working with artists at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, but also travelling to areas of the Yangtze River affected by construction of the Three Gorges Dam, and to Tibet. In the same year he once again worked with the Australian military, visiting members of the Australian-led Peace Monitoring Group, which was helping establish trust among Bougainvilleans in the peace process which was bringing an end to the civil war between secessionist Bougainvilleans and the Papua New Guinea government.

Gittoes had first encountered the victims of landmines in Nicaragua in 1986, and continued to meet them, in Cambodia, the Middle East and elsewhere. “For me,” Gittoes wrote, “landmines are the most damning proof of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man – while the moments spent with mine victims have given me some of the most encouraging proof of the strength of the human spirit.” In 1999 and 2000 he travelled widely to mine-affected areas: Thailand, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, East Timor, Congo and Rwanda, leading in 2000 to an exhibition, &quot;Minefields&quot;, in aid of victims and to support the international campaign (in which Australians took a leading role) to ban anti-personnel mines. As well as shows in Australia and Russia, the exhibition was displayed in the United Nations office in Geneva, in the Palais des Nations, the old headquarters building of the League of Nations.

In 2001 Gittoes made three trips to South Africa, to link up with a retrospective touring exhibition, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;. He also travelled once again to Israel and Palestine, documenting the ongoing conflict over Gaza.

==Art and films in the post–9/11 world, 2001–2010==
Gittoes was working at home in his studio at Bundeena, on the coast south of Sydney, when the world suddenly changed on 11 September 2001. The resulting wars and confusion in the Middle East were to provide the driving force for Gittoes’ career over the next decade and a half. By November 2001 the United States had invaded Afghanistan and overthrown the Taliban government, beginning a decade-and-a-half of war in the country. Gittoes had already visited Afghanistan as part of the &quot;Minefields&quot; project, and quickly became engaged in the effects of this new war on the country. He has maintained this engagement ever since. In early 2002 he travelled to Afghanistan for six weeks with Médecins sans Frontières, visiting refugee camps established after the invasion. He also had a commission from the Visible Art Foundation in Melbourne to paint three works marking the 11 September anniversary for the Republic Tower Art Space . The works, &quot;War on Terra&quot;, were rejected – for political reasons, Gittoes believed – but later exhibited at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. Later in the year, a trip to America, where the build-up to the war in Iraq had already begun, led to a turning point in Gittoes’ career. He had always been interested in popular culture, but now he saw a new importance in reaching the MTV and rap-music generation of younger Americans, many of whom would be fighting in the war. This helped lead him back into film-making.

In March 2003, he visited Iraq soon before the American-led invasion which began on 19 March. On this visit he was able to observe how Iraqi civilians were preparing for the war they knew was coming. After the invasion he visited Iraq three times before May 2004, interviewing American soldiers and Iraqi civilians and soldiers, focusing especially on the role of music on the modern battlefield. Although Australian troops were serving in Iraq, Gittoes had little contact with them. Out of this came one of his most acclaimed films, &quot;Soundtrack to War&quot;, which was released in 2004 and shown on Australian TV and on MTV in the United States. Some of Gittoes’ film was also used in Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. As well as film, Gittoes produced a lot of art out his time in Iraq, leading to an exhibition, &quot;No exit: a Tale of Two Cities – George Gittoes in New York and Baghdad&quot;. Two years later, in 2006, he linked up again with some of the African-American soldiers who had featured in Soundtrack to War, this time on their home turf in Miami, Florida, making a film, &quot;Rampage&quot;, about a gang-based sub-culture which some of the soldiers commented was more dangerous than Iraq. Rampage featured in a number of film festivals, and had cinema releases in Australia, Britain and the United States.

The following year, 2007, Gittoes began an enduring phase of making films in Pakistan and Afghanistan by filming the third film in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; trilogy, &quot;Miscreants of Taliwood&quot;, in the tribal belt in Pakistan&#x27;s North-West Frontier Province. In a departure from his previous films, this one was a docudrama combining the drama and action of a Pashtun telemovie with documentary footage from the Taliban-controlled tribal belt. Like all Gittoes’ films to this date, it was co-produced by his then wife, Gabrielle Dalton. Gittoes formed a good relationship with local film-makers and actors (some of whom later worked with him in Afghanistan), and worked with them to direct and produce two films in Pashto, the Pashtun language: &quot;Servants&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;. The art he produced in Pakistan led to an exhibition, &quot;The Time: a season in Pakistan&quot;, in Sydney in 2008. &quot;Miscreants of Taliwood&quot; was widely screened at major film festivals and on TV in 2009 and 2010. Gittoes was not done with film-making in Pakistan, but in the meantime he travelled to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait, where he once again linked up with units of the Australian Defence Force serving in these areas.

Gittoes had by now separated from his first wife in 2007. In 2008 Gittoes moved into his Surry Hills studio with Performance Artist and Musician Hellen Rose (married October 14, 2019). In 2009 and 2010 he rented a studio in Berlin, and had a productive period working on &quot;Descendance&quot;, a series of large-scale paintings inspired by events in the Middle East, but taking up themes and ideas from &quot;Night Vision&quot;, a long, cathartic novel which he periodically wrote up and revised. In 2010 with the aid of an international aid grant he returned to Pakistan&#x27;s tribal belt to make three more Pashto films with, to help develop the Pakistan film industry. These were three dramas: &quot;Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Starless Night&quot; and &quot;The Flood&quot;. He was assisted now by his new partner, Hellen Rose. The State Library of NSW holds a significant collection of material related to Gittoes&#x27; work in Australia and overseas including artists diaries.

==Work in Afghanistan, 2011–2015==
While maintaining a base in Sydney with partner Hellen Rose, in 2011 Gittoes and Rose began a long period working in Jalalabad, the second-largest city in Afghanistan. Jalalabad, in far eastern Afghanistan, has a predominantly Pashtun population, similar to the areas where Gittoes had been working across the Pakistan border. Here Gittoes and Rose set up a new Yellow House – the Yellow House Jalalabad – to be a centre of production and education in art, film-making, music, dance and performance. Inspired like the original Yellow House of 1970–71 as an artists’ cooperative which can use culture to counteract the prevailing landscape of war and conflict, the new Yellow House has as a slogan, “Declare love on war!!!!”, and aims to provide “a safe space where artists from all mediums meet, work and create independently of the destructive forces that not only threatens their physical lives but their inner spirit.” It also provides “a ‘safe haven’ for women&#x27;s arts and philosophy groups.” The Yellow House features a cinema, traveling tent circus, rainbow painting studios, Secret Garden Cafe and Rose Theatre outdoor stages. As well as activities in the House itself, the members have organized a travelling tent circus, film shows and other activities in villages in the area.

Working with Hellen Rose ( the first European woman to appear in Pashtun Films) but otherwise with an entirely Afghan and Pashtun cast and crew, in 2011 Gittoes made a trilogy of interconnected Pashto love films: &quot;Love City&quot;, &quot;Talk Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tailor&#x27;s Story&quot;. The following year he and his collaborators set up Buraq Films , based at the Yellow House, to produce high-quality films in Pashto. These have included the children&#x27;s film, &quot;Simorgh&quot;, directed by Neha, the first female Pashtun film-director. Another member of the Yellow House, Amir Shah Talash, has created a Pashto-language TV series. During the same period Gittoes was making a feature documentary, &quot;Love City Jalalabad&quot;, featuring key members of the Yellow House. The producer was Piraya Film, Stavanger, Norway. While documenting the difficulties of filming, especially with female actresses, in Afghanistan, the film articulates a positive message, that film-making and cultural production generally can be an alternative to armed force in bringing about social change. The film previewed at Documenta 13 in Kassel, Germany, before being released in 2013.

In 2013 Gittoes suffered from serious health problems, having both surgery for prostate cancer and a double knee replacement. He was also hospitalised with internal stomach bleeding. Nevertheless, he took up a position as artist in residence in Syracuse, New York, where he developed and produced the &quot;synthages&quot; referred to above, as a new means of working through his experiences at Kibeho nearly 20 years before. In 2014, undeterred by health problems, he returned to Jalalabad to begin work on his next film, &quot;Snow Monkey&quot;, for which he received funding from Film Australia. He returned to Sydney in early 2015 and &quot;Snow Monkey&quot; premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival in August 2015. With its searching portrayal of the lives of young people in Jalalabad, &quot;Snow Monkey&quot; won the Audience Award at the Biografilm Festival in Bologna, Italy, in June 2016.

==Recent work, 2016–2020==

In 2016, Gittoes published an anecdotal autobiography, &quot;Blood Mystic&quot;, combining reproductions of works with reminiscences spanning the whole of his life. He continued to paint, and in 2017 painted two portraits of Julian Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and a series of “black paintings” done in Jalalabad.

At the start of 2018 Gittoes began work on a new, even more ambitious film, &quot;White Light&quot;, a documentary filmed on the south side of Chicago, co-produced with partner Hellen Rose who is also the Music Director. With 500 fatal shootings a year in Chicago, and violent gangs controlling micro-territories, Gittoes found himself in as lawless and dangerous a place as any he had experienced. Gaining the trust of gang members, he was able to weave gun protests and the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King into his story. &quot;White Light&quot; aired on ABC on July 14, 2020, and is still showing on ABC iView.

Meanwhile, a new direction for Gittoes has been making Virtual Reality (VR) films, using a 360-degree camera, embracing the artistic possibilities of new technology in a way that harks back to his early work with holograms. The VR films have been made in collaboration with partner Hellen Rose and with long-time assistant and righthand frontline camera man, Pakistani Waqar Alam. The first, &quot;Fun Fair Jalalabad&quot;, was shown in 2017, a second, &quot;Bring in the Clowns&quot;, a satiric drama attacking opponents of gun control in the US, in 2018.

This period saw two large scale art works created in South Side Chicago, &#x27;Kill Kulture Amerika&#x27; and &#x27;Renaissance Park&#x27; acquired by the Peabody Essex Museum Salem, Massachusetts.

February 2020 Newcastle Art Gallery, Premiered the National Regional Touring Exhibition &#x27;On Being There&#x27; curated by Rod Pattenden. Focussing on the broader work done in communities like Afghanistan and South Side Chicago. This period also saw the theatrical release of White Light in Event Cinema&#x27;s.

During the Covid lockdown Gittoes created the Augustus Tower Suite reflecting his early Kennedy Suite of etchings created in the U.S. in 1968. &quot;This is a time when the bad guys have won.&quot; Gittoes describes today&#x27;s era comparing it with a time when US President John F Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King were assassinated.

October 7–11, 2020, Gittoes and Rose collaborated on a site specific exhibition, installation and performance. Gittoes exhibited The Augustus Tower Suite in the &#x27;Surf Shack Show&#x27; in a soon to be demolished house next door to his and Rose&#x27;s residence. The ageing house once inhabited by good friends and professional surfers was demolished to make way for a new home by the owners. The owners of the property willingly helped facilitate the show. Gittoes hung the entire Augustus Tower Suite in the house and Rose used the grounds to perform the accompanying Haunted Burqa performance and the back yard shed as an installation and experimental documentary film screening of the same title. Representing the faceless countless innocent victims of Gittoes&#x27; portrayed &#x27;bad guys&#x27;.

==Motivation==
Gittoes has travelled to many places for his art, including: Nicaragua, the Philippines, Somalia, Sinai, Southern Lebanon, Israel, Gaza, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Laos, Mozambique, South Africa, Congo, Rwanda, Yemen, Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Russia, Europe, UK, Bougainville, China, Taiwan, Tibet, Timor, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. He often travels to countries experiencing conflict and social upheaval, and uses these experiences extensively in his art. He has highlighted important issues, such as that of landmines. His travels have taken him to many dangerous places; he has been in serious danger on numerous occasions. He has faced traumatic events, such as Kibeho, a subject with which he is still working two decades later. He has explained the choice to work like this:

Or, to put it more simply, “The whole world is my studio.”

==Honours==
Gittoes&#x27; service to Australia has been recognised by the award of Member of the Order of Australia (1997) &quot;for service to art and international relations as an artist and photographer portraying the effects on the environment of war, international disasters and heavy industry&quot;.

<text>A tidal creek or tidal channel is a narrow inlet or estuary that is affected by the ebb and flow of ocean tides. Thus, it has variable salinity and electrical conductivity over the tidal cycle, and flushes salts from inland soils. Tidal creeks are characterized by slow water velocity, resulting in buildup of fine, organic sediment in wetlands. Creeks may often be a dry to muddy channel with little or no flow at low tide, but with significant depth of water at high tide. Due to the temporal variability of water quality parameters within the tidally influenced zone, there are unique biota associated with tidal creeks which are often specialised to such zones. Nutrients and organic matter are delivered downstream to habitats normally lacking these, while the creeks also provide access to inland habitat for salt-water organisms.

==Terminology==
A &quot;creek&quot; normally refers to a tidal water channel in British English and in other parts of the Anglosphere. This is the case in many countries in the Commonwealth, such as The Bahamas, as well as some parts of the United States (near the Chesapeake Bay, parts of New England, and southern Florida). In the tidal section of the River Thames in London, the names of the rivers that flow into it all become Creeks for the lower section that is tidal; thus, for example, the River Lea becomes Bow Creek in its tidal section. In parts of southwest England and Wales, the term &quot;pill&quot; is used, and is found in placenames such as Huntspill.

A narrow channel between islands in the Florida Keys is known there as a creek. On the India and Pakistan borders, the term also applies to the salt water inlets enclosed by mangroves. Creeks are found dispersed all along the Indian coast.

A &quot;tidal course&quot; is the more general term for any elongated indentation or valley in a wetland originated by tidal processes along which water flows pumped by tidal influence. 
It includes a series of indentations within a wide spectrum of sizes (width, length, and depth) and with at least two levels of inundation. Subtypes are tidal rills, tidal grooves, tidal gullies, that normally do not contain water even during neap low tide, and tidal creeks and tidal channels, that have water permanently.
A tidal course creates a system for its ecosystem that circulates water, sediments, organic matter, nutrient, and pollutants.
A tidal course is essential to the surrounding flora and fauna because they provide protection, nutrients, a place to reproduce, and a habitat for juvenile species before they go into the ocean.

== Development ==
Whereas areas of coastline that experience high wave activity are usually characterized by beaches, areas sheltered from wave action may develop tidal wetland systems. In these areas, upland creeks drain towards the shore, draining the high part of the coast. At some point they become tidal, technically estuarine.

As they come closer to shore, they often become very sinuous, due to the flatness of the land. In addition to draining upland fresh water (in many instances) tidal creeks form by the ebb tide seaward flow and downward incision of the water as it flows from inland to the shore. At high tide and spring tide, large areas are covered with water. This huge volume of water retreats at the start of the ebb tide in a surge. Later on during the ebb tide, water remains only in the creeks and the current is mainly a river (drainage) current and not tidal. Tidal creeks deposit sediment in a process called accretion, during the flood tide, which can maintain a flat plain by counteracting sea level rise or land subsidence. High tidal flow will maintain channels, while slower flow velocity can lead to closure of tidal creeks as they become clogged with sediment. Well-developed wetlands have sharp-banked tidal creeks, with vegetation stabilizing the sides of the creeks. Such tidal creeks will also be connected in networks: a multitude of smaller creeks called first-order creeks will feed into large ones, creating complex patterns of drainage.

== Human impact ==
Especially in areas prone to compaction or subsidence - like peat wetlands - human use of tidal creek flow can lead to the expansion of the creeks. Natural subsidence is compounded by anthropogenic sediment compaction, lowering the land level. Deforestation and other human-development-related processes can destabilize the banks of creeks and increase the amount of sediment in them. This slows the velocity of the water, which means that instead of cutting deeper channels, the water flows gently farther inland in shallow channels. Human development in tidal areas often results in diking, which changes the course of the tidal creeks and the salinity of the tidal area into freshwater.

Restoration of tidal wetlands begins with restoration of the creek systems, which determine the shape of the land, the nutrient and salinity levels, and the type of vegetation and animal communities in a wetland. 

==Examples==
There are thousands of examples of tidal creeks throughout the world. A few specific ones are:
*Burn of Ayreland, Mainland, Orkney, Scotland
*Americano Creek, California, US
*Crooked River, Florida, US
*Ennore Creek, Chennai, India
*Thane Creek, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Maharashtra, India
*Gorai Creek, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
*Vasai Creek, Thane, Maharashtra, India
*Dubai Creek, United Arab Emirates

<text>Charles &quot;Cy&quot; Rigler (May 16, 1882 – December 21, 1935) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League from 1906 to 1935. His total of 4,144 games ranked fourth in major league history when he retired, and his 2,468 games as a plate umpire still place him third behind his NL contemporaries Bill Klem (3,543) and Hank O&#x27;Day (2,710). Rigler is tied with O&#x27;Day for the second most World Series as an umpire (10), trailing only Klem&#x27;s 18. Rigler has also been credited with instituting the practice of using arm signals when calling balls and strikes.

Born in Massillon, Ohio, Rigler never played baseball in his younger days, although he played pro football briefly in 1903 as a tackle for the Massillon Tigers. As a young man he worked as a machinist, and also as a police officer and fireman, and was encouraged toward work as an umpire because his thick build served well in quelling disputes on the field between the ironworkers who formed local teams. He advanced quickly in the field, working in the Central League in 1904 at age 22; in 1905 his excellent work was noted by scouts for NL president Harry Pulliam, and he was hired by the NL late in the 1906 season, becoming the youngest regular umpire in that league&#x27;s history. His first major league game was on September 27, 1906, with the Brooklyn Dodgers visiting the Chicago Cubs; he became a member of the NL&#x27;s regular staff in April 1907.

While working in the minor leagues in 1905, Rigler had initiated the practice of using arm signals to note balls and strikes, so that those in the outfield would more clearly follow the action; by the time he arrived in the majors, he discovered that the practice had become so widespread that it had preceded him there. Rigler joined the majors at a time when the use of one umpire in a game was still common; by the time his career ended, three umpires had become standard. His solid frame was a decided asset in an era in which players were decidedly more aggressive in their dealings with umpires; and umpires in the NL were not as clearly defended by league officials as those in the American League, although they were also given a free rein in resolving disputes and in allowing their own personalities to emerge.

He not only proved skilled in officiating, but also became an expert in the design and groundskeeping of ballparks, and he laid out many of the most important parks in Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America by the early 1910s. In 1912 he was laying out the ballfield at the University of Virginia, while also serving as an assistant coach at the school, when he discovered pitcher Eppa Rixey and signed him for the Philadelphia Phillies. The ensuing controversy over league umpires signing players for teams whose games they would be officiating led to the establishment of a rule barring umpires from also acting as scouts.

Rigler was highly regarded for his outgoing nature and for his ability to let criticism roll off his back without becoming visibly irritated. He allowed players and managers to make their arguments, and demonstrated a willingness to eject only the most egregious offenders.

Rigler officiated in 10 World Series, second only to Bill Klem&#x27;s 18: 1910, 1912, 1913, 1915, 1917, 1919, 1921, 1925, 1928 and 1930. He was also one of the umpires in the first All-Star Game in 1933. One of his most memorable calls came in the 1925 Series, when Earl Smith&#x27;s long fly ball to right field in Game 3 reached Washington outfielder Sam Rice&#x27;s glove just as he fell over the wall into the outfield bleachers. When Rice emerged from the crowd with the ball in his glove, Rigler&#x27;s call of a catch and an out stoked controversy for decades as to whether Rice had indeed made the catch. Washington won the game 4–3, although they went on to lose the Series to Pittsburgh.

He was the base umpire on May 2, 1917, when Fred Toney of the Cincinnati Reds and Jim &quot;Hippo&quot; Vaughn of the Chicago Cubs pitched opposing no-hitters for 9 innings, with Vaughn finally giving up 2 hits and a run in the 10th inning to take the loss. Rigler was again the base umpire on August 25, 1922, when the Cubs defeated the Phillies 26–23 in the highest-scoring 9-inning game in history.

Rigler was promoted to supervisor of the NL staff in December 1935 following the death of Hank O&#x27;Day, but he never got the opportunity to fulfill his duties. He died less than two weeks later, following surgery for a brain tumor, in Philadelphia at age 53.

Rigler ejected Johnny Evers from 22 ballgames. , no umpire had ejected any person more times. The second place umpire-competitor combination had only 15 ejections.

<text>A war artist is an artist either commissioned by a government or publication, or self-motivated, to document first-hand experience of war in any form of illustrative or depictive record. War artists explore the visual and sensory dimensions of war, often absent in written histories or other accounts of warfare.
These artists may be involved in war as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel, or as specifically commissioned to be present and record military activity.

Artists record military activities in ways that cameras and the written word cannot. Their art collects and distills the experiences of the people who endured it. The artists and their artwork affect how subsequent generations view military conflicts. For example, Australian war artists who grew up between the two world wars were influenced by the artwork which depicted the First World War, and there was a precedent and format for them to follow.

Official war artists have been appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield, but there are many other types of war artists. These can include combatants who are artists and choose to record their experiences, non-combatants who are witnesses of war, and prisoners of war who may voluntarily record the conditions or be appointed war artists by senior officers.

In New Zealand, the title of appointed &quot;war artist&quot; is &quot;army artist&quot;. In the United States, the term &quot;combat artist&quot; has come to be used to mean the same thing.

== Some examples and their background ==
* William Simpson was an artist-correspondent who sent artwork to London from the front during the Crimean War. 
* Alfred Waud was an American Civil War pictorial newspaper illustrator. 
* Ogata Gekkō and Tsuguharu Foujita created woodblock prints for Japanese publications. 
* Ronald Searle recorded life in Japanese POW camps. 
* Emmanuel Leutze&#x27;s 1851 studio painting of &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; is historically incorrect, and Leutze was born decades after the event his painting depicts, but this work has become an icon of popular culture.

==War artists by nationality==
===Argentine===
*Cándido López (1840–1902), Paraguayan War

===Australian===
War artists have depicted all the conflicts in which Australians have been called to combat. The Australian tradition of &quot;official war artists&quot; started with the First World War. Artists were granted permission to accompany the Australian Imperial Force to record the activities of its soldiers. During the Second World War, the Australian War Museum, later called the Australian War Memorial, engaged artists. At the same time, the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force appointed official war artist-soldiers from within their ranks. These embedded war artists have depicted the activities of Australian forces in Korea, Vietnam, East Timor, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

The ranks of non-soldier artists like George Gittoes continue to create artwork which becomes a commentary on Australia&#x27;s military actions in war.

Selected artists
A select list of representative Australian artists includes:

===Austrian===
* Alfred Basel
* Roman Zenzinger

===British===

British participation in foreign wars has been the subject of paintings and other works created by Britain&#x27;s war artists. Artwork like the 1688 painting,&quot;The Fleet at Sea&quot; by Willem van de Velde the Younger depict the Royal Navy in readiness for battle. The Ministry of Defence art collection includes many paintings showing battle scenes, particularly naval battles. Military art and portraiture has evolved along with other aspects of war. The British official war artists of the First World War created a unique account of that conflict. The British War Artists Scheme expanded the number of official artists and enlarged the scope of their activities during the Second War.

Significant themes in the chronicle of twentieth-century wars have been developed by non-military, non-official, civilian artists. For example, society portraitist Arabella Dorman&#x27;s paintings of wounded Iraq War veterans inspired her to spend two weeks with three regiments in different frontline areas: the Green Jackets at Basra Palace, the Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkhas at Shaibah Logistics Base ten miles south-west of Basra, and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers in the Maysaan desert. In the field, Dorman drew quick charcoal portraits of the men she met. Returning to England, the sketches she made helped her use art to &quot;evoke the emotions and psychological impact of war,&quot; rather than depicting the &quot;physical horror&quot; of war.

* Alfred Bastien, 1873—1955

===Canadian===
Representative works by Canada&#x27;s artists whose work illustrates and records war are gathered into the extensive collection of the Canadian War Museum. The earliest war art in Canada was rock art created by Indigenous peoples from all regions of the country. During the colonial period, large-scale, European-style paintings of war dominated New France and British North America. The First and Second World Wars saw a dramatic increase in the production of war art in every medium. A few First World War paintings were exhibited in the Senate of Canada Chamber, and artists studied these works as a way of preparing to create new artworks in the conflict in Europe which expanded after 1939.
In the Second World War, Canada expanded its official art program; Canadian war artists were a kind of journalist who lived the lives of soldiers. The work of non-official civilian artists also became part of the record of this period. Canada supported Canadian official war artists in both the First World War and the Second World War; no official artists were designated during the Korean War.

Among Canada&#x27;s embedded artist-journalist teams was Richard Johnson, who was sent by the &quot;National Post&quot; to Afghanistan in 2007 and 2011; his drawings of Canadian troops were published and posted online as part of the series &quot;Kandahar Journal&quot;.

Prominent themes explored by Canadian war artists include commemoration, identity, women, Indigenous representation, propaganda, protest, violence, and religion.

During the First World War, the work of artists depicting aspects of the military conflict were put on display in official war art exhibitions. In 1916 the Ministry of Beaux-Arts and the Ministry of War sponsored the Salon des Armées to show the work of the artists who had been mobilized. This one exhibition realized 60,000 francs. The proceeds supported needy artists at home and the disabled.

===New Zealand===
War artists have been appointed by the government to supplement the record of New Zealand&#x27;s military history. The title of &quot;war artist&quot; changed to &quot;army artist&quot; when Ion Brown was appointed after the two world wars.

Conservators at the National Art Gallery considered the collection to be of historic rather than artistic worth; few were displayed. New Zealand&#x27;s National Collection of War Art encompasses the work of artists who were working on commission for the Government as official war artists, while others created artworks for their own reasons.

===United States===

The American panorama created by artists whose work focuses on war began with a visual account of the American Revolutionary War. The war artist or combat artist captures instantaneous action and conflates earlier moments of the same scene within one compelling image. Artists are unlike the objective camera lens, which records only a single instant and no more.

In 1917 the American military designated American official war artists who were sent to Europe to record the activities of the American Expeditionary Forces.

In World War II, the Navy Combat Art Program ensured that active-duty artists developed a record of all phases of the war and all major naval operations.

The official war artist continued to be supported in some military engagements. Teams of soldier-artists during the Vietnam War created pictorial accounts and interpretations for the annals of army military history. In 1992 the Army Staff Artist Program was attached to the United States Army Center of Military History as a permanent part of the Museum Division&#x27;s Collections Branch.

The majority of combat artists of the 1970s were selected by George Gray, chairman of NACAL, Navy Air Cooperation and Liaison committee. Some of their paintings will be selected for the Navy Combat Art Museum in the capital by Charles Lawrence, director. In January 1978 the U.S. Navy chose a seascape specialist team: they asked Patricia Yaps and Wayne Dean, both of Milford, Connecticut, to capture air-sea rescue missions off of Key West while they were based at the nearby Naval Air Station Key West. They were among 78 artists selected that year to create works of art depicting Navy subjects.

<text>Contemporary Sant Mat Movements, mostly among the Radha Soami tradition, are esoteric philosophy movements active in the United States, Europe, Australia, Latin America, and especially India. These movements assert that Sant Mat shares a lineage with Sikhism and contains elements of thought found in Hinduism, such as karma and reincarnation. They further assert that Sant Mat also contains elements found in Sufism and has inspired and influenced a number of religious groups and organizations. They refer to this spiritual path as the &quot;Science of the Soul&quot; or &#x27;Sant Mat&#x27;, meaning &#x27;teachings of the saints&#x27;. More recently it has been described as &quot;The Way of Life&quot; or &quot;Living the Life of Soul&quot;. It incorporates a practical yoga system known as Surat Shabd Yoga.

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to incorporate a personal and private path of spiritual development in the common tradition of mystics past and present. They discuss the irrelevance of rituals, priestly class, mandatory contributions, or compulsory gatherings.

==Introduction==
The basic teaching of contemporary Sant Mat, as described by its Masters, is that everything lies inside us and that God is within. The outside world is only an image or a reflection of the inner reality. So self-knowledge or knowledge of the higher self and God-knowledge (taken as a practical project rather than a theoretical inquiry) are the topics of Sant Mat.

Kirpal Singh describes Sant Mat as a synonym for &quot;Surat Shabd Yoga&quot;, the yoga of the Sound Current, or more simply &quot;Shabd yoga&quot;, a meditation technique he asserts was taught and practiced originally in northern India. Singh writes that practitioners of Shabd yoga position the path as not requiring the physical torture of penance and austerities that marked many of the yogas and spiritual paths throughout the ages. Thus it is sometimes called &quot;Sehaj&quot; (easy) yoga.

Widely accepted translations of the Indian term &quot;Sant Mat&quot; are &quot;Teachings of the Saints&quot; and &quot;Path of the Masters&quot;. These are both incidentally the titles of prominent works on the subject. Another commonly accepted definition of the term is found in Man Know Thyself by Sant Kirpal Singh:

However, terminology, names, and groups are not considered to be of any importance in Sant Mat:

==Origins==

Sant Mat (literally, &quot;school of the Sants&quot;) was a loosely associated group of teachers that assumed prominence in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent from about the 13th century. Their teachings are distinguished theologically by inward loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an egalitarianism opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Indian caste hierarchy and to the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam.

==Geographical reach==
Contemporary Sant Mat movements exist all over the world.

Radha Soami Satsang Beas, the mission begun by Jaimal Singh at the turn of the 19th century, has its headquarters known as &quot;Dera Baba Jaimal Singh&quot;, near the river Beas in northern India since 1891. His master Shiv Dayal Singh had perhaps 500 initiates, and if one wanted to see the Master it was necessary to travel to his home in Agra. His lineage continues at Radhasoami Satsang Dayalbagh, Agra in India. The Dayalbagh Agra lineage follow Shiv Dayal Singh - Salig Ram -Maharaj Sahab - Kamta Prasad Sinha- Anand Swarup - Gurcharan Das Mehta - Makund Behari Lal and recently (Since 2003 Prem Saran Satsangi. Jaimal Singh had perhaps 2500 initiates and did not travel more than a few hundred miles from Beas while he was a Master. Sawan Singh did not travel outside of India, but is believed to have had as many as one lac (100,000) initiates, some of whom were foreigners. Jagat Singh also did not travel outside India. Charan Singh did travel overseas and the present master Gurinder Singh, travels to nearly 90 countries. Today the Radha Soami Satsang Beas is leading the way forward and encompassing all the teachings of the saints.

Sant Kirpal Singh visited Europe and the United States in 1955 and 1963, and Europe, America, and Latin America in 1972. The various spiritual leaders who claim to lead this movement now frequently travel all over the world.

==General tenets==
The most central tenet is the need to be initiated by a living Master or Satguru (&quot;sat&quot; meaning true and &quot;guru&quot; meaning Master or Spiritual Teacher). &quot;Competent Master&quot; is another common formulation: the Master must be competent in the sense of having been commissioned by God, not just a person who feels like working in the role of a guru:

It is a sad affair that there are thousands of imitators, of false copies, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the world is devoid of truth and that a Master is not available to the people...It has always been a law that at least one complete master would be on earth to bring God&#x27;s truth to the people. One such Master can benefit the entire world just as one sun can glorify and light up the entire world. [16] 

Technically speaking Sant Mat practice involves listening to the Inner Sound, contemplating Inner Light, and (eventually) leaving the human body at will - a practice sometimes referred to as &quot;dying while living&quot;. The principal intent is to awaken the Soul and unite it with God. Sant Mat is a practical and not a theoretical investigation.

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to be different in a radical sense from other disciplines or kinds of knowledge which can be taught. It claims to be a meta-knowledge or method of going beyond knowledge and deprecates the mind and mental processes, at all times describing a dichotomy between the mind and the soul, in which the mind is only a negative copy or imitation of the soul. The mind is to become still and quiet so that the soul can begin to experience itself. 

The second essential tenet is the mystical role of the Sound Current:

&quot;Prajapatir vai idam-agree asit Tasya vak dvitiya asit Vak vai Paramam Brahma&quot; (from Vedas)

In the beginning was Prajapati (the Creator),
With Him was the Vak (the Word),
And the Vak (the Word) was verily the
Supreme Brahman.

Proponents compare this with the verses of John 1 John to assert their special use of comparative religion (seeking the common thread in all religions and esoteric phenomena). &quot;Naam or Word&quot; , written by Sant Kirpal Singh, explores this theme. It asserts that the Sound Current is the esoteric form of God which is available to human beings. The Guru, who is a human being, has merged with the Sound Current in such a manner that he is a living manifestation of it (the Word made flesh). However, not just the Guru can achieve this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way 

===Helping factors===
Beyond the two main tenets, Contemporary Sant Mat movements emphasize an ethical lifestyle and selfless service. They assert that these are not spirituality as such, but are necessary preparation for true spirituality to commence. A self-introspective diary or daily diary tracking ethical lifestyle in five cardinal disciplines is sometimes recommended as a way to self-monitor one&#x27;s own ethical condition. The five cardinal virtues tracked by
the diary are &quot;Ahimsa&quot; or Nonviolence, Truthfulness, Chastity, love for all regardless of caste, creed, wealth, or intellectual attainments (i.e., Humility), and finally the maintenance of a strict Vegetarian diet. Drugs and alcohol are also to be avoided, as is the company of worldly-minded people.

Selfless Service or Seva means devoting oneself to mental, physical, or financial service to the Guru, and the sangat (or devotees). Mental service means keeping constant remembrance of God by means of repetition of the Mantra (known as Simran) or by other means keeping the Guru in mind. Physical service means doing some physical work, as in the situation where one helps dig a well at an ashram or gives a talk about the Master to the public. Financial service means giving money to the mission of the Master (to his organization) instead of spending it on oneself. The concept of Financial Seva is quite similar to tithing as known generally in Christianity. Also, just as a very general rule, at least 10% of one&#x27;s time should be spent in meditation.

===Practices===
Contemporary Sant Mat movements assert that the &quot;Master&quot; or Guru is provided by God as the channel through which God manifests in the world - God is believed to be unknowable and inconceivable, so he has created Gurus as a way in which to be available. Only humans are capable of interacting with a Master, as other forms of life are asserted to be incapable of doing so.

Teachers of contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to teach a spiritual path which is intentionally easier than others described in the ancient scriptures as it requires nothing more than sitting quietly and looking and listening within. 

Specifics of this process include connecting one&#x27;s soul or attention, called &quot;Surat (soul)&quot; with the inner Current of Light and Sound of God, the Shabd. Adherents believe this Sound Current cannot be heard by the uninitiated; it is made manifest at the time of initiation. An essential component of the practice involves sitting still with eyes closed, with one&#x27;s attention focused at the &quot;third eye center&quot;, located between and behind the two eyebrows, while (mentally) repeating one or more mantras given by the Guru to the disciple at the time of initiation. This is called simran (repetition) and its primary function is to still the mind while remembering (or being connected to) the Guru via the mantra he provided. However listening to the Sound Current by plugging the ears with the thumbs and listening at the right side or above is equally as important. Sound is considered to be the source of the Light, and to contain everything required. 

The concept of Satsang is also a common thread in contemporary Sant Mat movements&#x27; practices. Satsang means literally &quot;gathering of Truth.&quot; These gatherings serve as the formal meeting place of the Master and his devotees when he is present in physical form, but also, more often, follow the tradition of early Christianity and take place in the homes of disciples or in any convenient location as times of remembrance of the Master and the need for meditation.

In contemporary Sant Mat movements, not everyone automatically qualifies for Initiation; many teachers require that prospective followers be spiritually “ready”. This was especially true in earlier times, when people made more time available. There are definite criteria for judging whether or not a person is indeed ready for initiation: they must be ready to eschew drugs and alcohol, lead a disciplined and chaste lifestyle, avoid spiritual healing and other forms of meditation, and commit to several hours of meditation per day.

==Sects==
There are many sects/movements within contemporary Sant Mat movements, with different leaders and varying belief systems. Examples include Advait Mat and Radha Soami with following sub-lineages: the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, Radha Soami Satsang Dayalbagh, Radha Swami Satsang, Dinod, Ruhani Satsang, and also the Science of Spirituality (SOS) with Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission and Dera Sacha Sauda.

The work of David C. Lane provides a partial catalogue of various sects related to the Radha Soami Satsang Beas and attempts to study their formation from a socio-economic point of view. Mark Juergensmeyer has also extensively studied groups related to Radha Soami Satsang Beas.

===Related movements===
The new religious movement Eckankar is considered by some to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. Paul Twitchell, who founded Eckankar, was an initiate of Kirpal Singh.

The similar to Eckancar American syncretistic Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness was founded in 1971 by John-Roger Hinkins.

The &quot;Quan Yin Method&quot; of meditation promoted though the spiritual teachings of Ching Hai, a former student of Thakar Singh, also has notable similarities to Sant Mat.

The Elan Vital, formerly Divine Light Mission, founded by Hans Maharaj and succeeded by his sons Prem Rawat and Satpal Maharaj, was characterized as part of the Sant Mat tradition. Satpal Maharaj also established the Manav Utthan Sewa Samiti.

In the West, detailed indications and advice have been given by Edward Salim Michael in his book &quot;The Law of attention, Nada Yoga and the way of inner vigilance&quot;. Ajahn Sumedho, from the Thai Forest Tradition teaches the practice of this inner sound.

<text>Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora is a shallow coastal lake or waituna, in the Canterbury region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is directly to the west of Banks Peninsula, separated from the Pacific Ocean by the long, narrow, sandy Kaitorete Spit. It lies partially in extreme southeastern Selwyn District and partially in the city of Christchurch&#x27;s district. The lake holds high historical and cultural significance to the indigenous Māori population and the traditional Māori name &quot;Te Waihora&quot; means &quot;spreading waters&quot;. It has officially had a dual English/Māori name since at least 1938.

== Geography and hydrology ==
Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora is a brackish bar-type water body, commonly called a lake or lagoon. It covers an area of , and is New Zealand&#x27;s fifth largest lake.

== Nature ==

Southern elephant seals have been observed here, spending short periods in the lake. Basking sharks have occasionally entered the lake.

Lake Ellesmere is also home to a wide variety of birds, with over 200 species (if extinct species are also included) having been recorded at the lake and its direct surroundings. Lake Ellesmere has become a well-known bird watching location for certain rare species, such as the Australasian Bittern, Marsh Crake and Kotuku. Wading birds of various species frequent the lake and its surroundings, including native species such as the Pied Stilt, South Island Pied Oystercatcher, Banded Dotterel and Wrybill, and also Arctic migrants such as the Bar-Tailed Godwit, Red-Necked Stint, Sharp-Tailed Sandpiper and Pacific Golden Plover, among others. Waterfowl are also prominent residents on the lake, with native species including Paradise Shelduck, New Zealand Scaup, Australasian Shoveler and Grey Teal. Grey Teal are actually considered one of the most abundant bird species on the lake. Introduced waterfowl species include Mallards, feral Greylag Geese, Canada Geese, Mute Swan and Black Swan, with the latter being another one of the lake&#x27;s most abundant birds. Cormorants such as the Black Shag, Pied Shag and Little Shag are commonly seen in the lake. Black-Backed Gull, Red-Billed Gull and Black-Billed Gull can be seen in and around the lake, as can some tern species such as the Caspian Tern, White-Fronted Tern and Black-Fronted Tern, and the rarer White-Winged Tern. A wide variety of other birds can also be seen in and around the lake, including White-Faced Heron, Eastern Cattle Egret, Royal Spoonbill, Australasian Harrier, Pukeko, Spotless Crake, Sacred Kingfisher, as well as various introduced Galliforms and both native and introduced Passerines. A variety of rare vagrant birds have also appeared at Lake Ellesmere over the years, with some of these including Little Stint, Long-Toed Stint, Stilt Sandpiper, and Cox&#x27;s Sandpiper. Australian Terns are also rare visitors to the lake.

== History ==
The lake has been up to twice its present depth and area in the past, and it has progressed through various stages as it has developed into the current brackish bar-type lagoon. In chronological order these stages began with the lake as part of Canterbury plains, which were then flooded, forming a bay, then an estuary and finally a lake.

==Cultural significance==
Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora has been a revered &quot;mahinga kai&quot; (site of traditional significance for food and other natural resources) for Māori since ancient times and remains central to the lives of many Māori who now live in the area. Under the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement 1998, ownership of the lake bed of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora was returned to Te Rūnanga O Ngāi Tahu, who are now able to reassert their &quot;rangatiratanga&quot; (ownership) over this significant site through direct control of its management.

The traditional name for the lake was &quot;Te Kete Ika o Rākaihautū&quot; meaning &quot;the fish basket of Rākaihautū&quot;. The food sources of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora were once abundant and included &quot;tuna&quot; (eels), &quot;pātiki&quot; (flounder) and &quot;aua&quot; (mullet). Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora was a famed &quot;mahinga manu wai māori&quot; (place for taking waterfowl). However, today the richness of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora as a &quot;mahinga kai&quot; has been largely lost to farmland. While it remains a &quot;mahinga kai&quot;, its yields have been significantly reduced due to the periodic drainage of the lake in order to maintain reclaimed land and pasture. Before European settlement in New Zealand, the control of the lake&#x27;s level was retained at an optimum water level for the birdlife that lived there and provided &quot;kai&quot; (food) for many people. The lake was only drained when its level exceeded the normal maximum. &quot;Kōrari&quot; (flax stalks) were dragged across the sand to make the initial opening of the water to the sea. Such carefully monitored drainage of the lake took place for several hundred years, consistently maintaining Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora&#x27;s abundant supply of &quot;kai&quot;.

In 2007 an assessment of the cultural health of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora was undertaken as a combined effort by Ngai Tahu and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).

=== Recreation ===

As well as holding high cultural significance to the indigenous population, Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora is also rated as a nationally significant site for recreation. The lake is currently used for a wide range of water and land based activities.

Many of these activities are reliant on a healthy natural ecosystem, especially fish and wildlife habitat, and a decrease in the number of people participating in trout fishing and other activities has been recorded since 1996.

== State of the lake and future management ==
In a 2010 report on lake water quality, Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora was deemed the second most polluted lake in New Zealand in terms of nutrient content and algal growth. Algal blooms are a regular summer occurrence and toxic algae bloomed in the lake in 2009.

Results for E. coli levels are also poor with 42% of sites associated with the lake failing national recreational guide standards for water quality. No sites achieved the shellfish/food gathering standard or were fit for drinking.

<text>Richard Michael Patrick (born May 10, 1968) is an American singer, musician and songwriter. He is the frontman for the rock band Filter and a founding member of the supergroups Army of Anyone and The Damning Well, and has served as a touring guitarist for Nine Inch Nails.

== Career ==

===Nine Inch Nails===
After a chance meeting with Trent Reznor in a Cleveland music store, Patrick landed a gig as touring guitarist in Reznor&#x27;s live incarnation of Nine Inch Nails from 1989 to 1993. His only recorded contribution can be heard at the end of &quot;Sanctified&quot; on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. Patrick also appeared in the music videos for &quot;Down in It&quot;, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, and one of the two promo videos for &quot;Gave Up&quot; (along with Marilyn Manson), which was filmed in the living room of the infamous house where Sharon Tate was murdered in 1969, as Reznor had leased the house and installed a recording studio in it. Patrick chose to leave the band during the recording of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; in 1993 following a comment from Reznor to &quot;get up off his ass and go write a record&quot; in response to Patrick asking for more money, further suggesting Patrick to work as a delivery driver at a pizzeria.

In September 2022, Patrick joined other past members of Nine Inch Nails onstage for a special performance, playing classic tracks from his time with the band as well as covering his Filter hit, &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot;.

===Filter===
Before his departure from Nine Inch Nails, Patrick formed his own band, Filter, with Brian Liesegang, who left the band after the recording of the band&#x27;s first album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Short Bus&quot;. Four years later, Richard Patrick released Filter&#x27;s second album, &quot;Title of Record&quot;, with help from guitarist Geno Lenardo.

Filter&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Amalgamut&quot;, was released in 2002, with Patrick canceling most of the supporting tour to check into rehab for alcoholism, a problem that had been plaguing him for years. An experience where he drank on an airplane inspired Filter&#x27;s hit single &quot;Take a Picture.&quot;

After a five-year hiatus, Filter released a fourth record on May 13, 2008, entitled &quot;Anthems for the Damned&quot;. Patrick did the vocals and the majority of the instrumentation on the album except for the drumming, which was done by Josh Freese. He also worked with Wes Borland and John 5 on a few individual songs.

For the first time in the band&#x27;s history, the band released an album without a three-to five-year break in between, with their fifth record, &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot;, which was released just over two years after &quot;Anthems&quot; on August 17, 2010. Patrick recorded the album with the &quot;Anthems for the Damned&quot; touring band, Mikea Fineo, Mitch Marlow, and John Spiker, but recruited a new guitarist (Rob Patterson) and bass player (Phil Buckman) for touring in support of the album.

Patrick returned to the studio in April 2012, to work with producer Bob Marlette and Kill Hannah guitarist, Jonny Radtke, on his next Filter album, under the working title &quot;Gurney and the Burning Books&quot;. After Filter was signed to Wind-up Records in September 2012, Patrick released his sixth studio album &quot;The Sun Comes Out Tonight&quot; on June 4, 2013.

In early 2015, Patrick reunited with Ben Grosse, Michael &quot;Blumpy&quot; Tuller, Brian Virtue and former Filter guitarist Brian Liesegang to begin recording Filter&#x27;s most recent album. After launching a PledgeMusic campaign, Patrick and contributing artists Oumi Kapila, Chris Reeve and Ashley Dzerigian released Filter&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; on April 8, 2016.

In 2018, Patrick reunited with Brian Liesegang to record a followup to &quot;Short Bus&quot; entitled &quot;Rebus&quot;, and funded the project using PledgeMusic. The project remains unreleased due to PledgeMusic going bankrupt. Patrick and Liesegang decided to mount a &quot;Title of Record&quot; 20th anniversary tour in the Fall of 2019, but the tour was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts with deadlines for film scores that Patrick was working on. In lieu of the &quot;Rebus&quot; release, Patrick instead plans to release a new Filter album with a different lineup of musicians entitled &quot;The Algorithm.&quot;

===Army of Anyone===

While writing songs for Filter&#x27;s fourth album, Patrick called up the DeLeo brothers of Stone Temple Pilots to help him write a song. The result was a song called &quot;A Better Place.&quot; Due to the chemistry the trio had while writing the song, they decided to form a supergroup, which became Army of Anyone.

On September 29, 2005, the formation of Army of Anyone was announced. Along with Dean and Robert DeLeo, future drummer for Korn, Ray Luzier, was also added to the line-up.

Army of Anyone&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on November 14, 2006. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, peaked at number three on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

On May 26, 2007, Army of Anyone played their last concert to date in El Paso, Texas. The band has since been on hiatus.

===Film composition===
Patrick composed the score for Alexandros Avranas&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Dark Crimes&quot;, a crime thriller based on a 2008 David Grann article published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. 
In 2017, Richard and his brother Robert Patrick contributed to the film score of &quot;Last Rampage&quot;.

===Writing===
On August 25, 2008, Patrick wrote an editorial, &quot;Talking About War&quot;, for the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;. He has since started writing a column, called &quot;Filtering The Truth,&quot; for Suicide Girls. His first post, about politics and religion, was posted on Election Day 2008.

==Personal life==
Patrick graduated from Bay High School in Bay Village, Ohio in 1987. He is of Scottish-Irish and English ancestry.

Patrick and his wife Tina have a daughter, born in 2008, and a son, born in 2009. After years of alcohol and drug abuse issues, he has been sober since September 2002.

Patrick&#x27;s older brother is actor Robert Patrick.

<text>The Battle of Imphal () took place in the region around the city of Imphal, the capital of the state of Manipur in Northeast India from March until July 1944. Japanese armies attempted to destroy the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, but were driven back into Burma with heavy losses. Together with the simultaneous Battle of Kohima on the road by which the encircled Allied forces at Imphal were relieved, the battle was the turning point of the Burma campaign, part of the South-East Asian theatre of World War II. The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest up until that time, with many of the Japanese deaths resulting from starvation, disease and exhaustion suffered during their retreat. According to voting in a contest run by the British National Army Museum, the Battle of Imphal was bestowed as Britain&#x27;s Greatest Battle in 2013.

==Situation==

===Background===
In March 1943, the Japanese command in Burma had been reorganised. A new headquarters, Burma Area Army, was created under Lieutenant-General Masakazu Kawabe. One of its subordinate formations, responsible for the central part of the front facing Imphal and Assam, was the Fifteenth Army. Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi was appointed to command this army in March 1943. From the moment he took command, Mutaguchi forcefully advocated an invasion of India. His motives for doing so appear to be uncertain. He had played a major part in several Japanese victories, ever since the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937, and believed it was his destiny to win the decisive battle of the war for Japan. He may also have been goaded by the first Chindit expedition, a raid behind Japanese lines launched by the British under Orde Wingate early in 1943. The Allies had widely publicised the successful aspects of Wingate&#x27;s expedition while concealing their losses to disease and exhaustion, possibly leading Mutaguchi and some of his staff to underestimate the difficulties they would later face.

At the start of 1944, the war was going against the Japanese on several fronts. They were being driven back in the central and southwest Pacific, and their merchant ships were under attack by Allied submarines and aircraft. In Southeast Asia, they had held their lines over the preceding year, but the Allies were preparing several offensives from India and the Chinese province of Yunnan into Burma. In particular, the town of Imphal in Manipur on the frontier with Burma was built up to be a substantial Allied logistic base, with airfields, encampments and supply dumps. Imphal was linked to an even larger base at Dimapur in the Brahmaputra River valley by a road which wound for through the steep and forested Naga Hills.

===Japanese offensive planning===

Mutaguchi intended to exploit his planned capture of Imphal by advancing to the Brahmaputra Valley. This would cut the Allied lines of communication to the front in northern Burma, where the American-led Northern Combat Area Command was attempting to construct the Ledo Road to link India and China by land, and to the airfields supplying the Nationalist Chinese under Chiang Kai-shek via an airlift over &quot;The Hump&quot; (the Himalaya Mountains). Although the staffs at Burma Area Army and at Southern Expeditionary Army Group (the supreme command for the Japanese forces in southeast Asia and the southern Pacific) had reservations over the scale of Mutaguchi&#x27;s proposed operation, they were eventually won over by his persistent advocacy. Finally, Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and Imperial General Headquarters gave their approval to the plan.

Mutaguchi intended to block the supply lines to the Allied units in their forward positions, to isolate and destroy them, drawing the Allied reserves into the battle and then capture Imphal. His plan was named U-Go, or Operation C. In detail:
* The 33rd Infantry Division under Lieutenant-General Motoso Yanagida would surround and destroy the 17th Indian Division at Tiddim, then attack Imphal from the south.
* Yamamoto Force, formed from units detached from the Japanese 33rd and 15th Divisions under Major-General Tsunoru Yamamoto (commander of 33rd Division&#x27;s Infantry Group), would destroy the 20th Indian Division at Tamu, then attack Imphal from the east. The force was supported by the 14th Tank Regiment, equipped with 66 assorted tanks, under Lieutenant Colonel Nobuo Ueda and the 3rd Heavy Artillery Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Kazuo Mitsui.
* The 15th Infantry Division under Lieutenant-General Masafumi Yamauchi would envelop Imphal from the north. This division was still arriving from road-building duties in Thailand and was understrength at the start of the operation.
* In a separate subsidiary operation, the 31st Infantry Division under Lieutenant-General Kotoku Sato would isolate Imphal by capturing Kohima on the Imphal-Dimapur road, and then advance to Dimapur.

At the insistence of Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of the Azad Hind (a movement which sought to overthrow British rule in India by force, with Japanese assistance), the Indian National Army made a substantial contribution. Originally, the Japanese intended using them only for reconnaissance and propaganda.
* Units of the First Division (initially the Subhas Brigade or 1st Guerrilla Regiment, less a battalion sent to the Arakan) covered the left flank of 33rd Division&#x27;s advance.
* The 2nd Guerrilla Regiment was attached later in the battle to &quot;Yamamoto Force&quot;.
* The Special Services Group, redesignated the &quot;Bahadur Group&quot;, acted as scouts and pathfinders with the advanced Japanese units in the opening stages of the offensive. They were tasked to infiltrate through British lines and encourage units of the British Indian Army to defect.

All of Mutaguchi&#x27;s divisional commanders disagreed with the plan to some extent. Sato distrusted Mutaguchi&#x27;s motives, and Yanagida openly derided his abrasive superior as a &quot;blockhead.&quot; Yamauchi was already very ill and fatalistic. Their main reservations concerned supply. Mutaguchi had assumed that success would be achieved within three weeks, but adequate supplies after that period could be obtained only if the Japanese captured Allied supply dumps, as the monsoon rains, which usually descended from about the middle of May, would make the supply routes from the Chindwin almost impossible to traverse. Gambles such as Mutaguchi was making had worked in the past, but could no longer be relied upon, given nearly total Allied air superiority in the area and the improvement in morale and training of British and Indian troops. Mutaguchi proposed to use &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; rations, driving herds of buffalo and cattle rounded up throughout northern Burma across the Chindwin as meat rations on the hoof. However, most of these beasts died from lack of forage and their meat rotted many miles from the troops they were intended to supply.

There were other weaknesses in the plan, which were revealed as the campaign progressed. The Japanese assumed that the British would be unable to use tanks on the steep jungle-covered hills around Imphal. For ease of movement and supply, the Japanese left behind most of their field artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. As a result, their troops would have little protection against tanks.

Based on his experiences in the campaigns in Malaya and Singapore and in the Japanese conquest of Burma in early 1942, Mutaguchi dismissed British and Indian troops as inherently inferior. The troops he had met on those occasions had generally been inadequately trained and led. The Allies, under general William Slim, had by now largely overcome the administrative and organisational problems which had crippled their early efforts in Burma, and their troops were far better trained and motivated.

===Allied defensive arrangements===
Imphal was held by the IV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Geoffry Scoones. The corps was in turn part of the Fourteenth Army under Lieutenant General William Slim. Because the Allies were planning to take the offensive themselves, the corps&#x27; units were thrown forward almost to the Chindwin River and widely separated, and were therefore vulnerable to being isolated and surrounded.
* 20th Indian Infantry Division under Major-General Douglas Gracey occupied Tamu, south-east of Imphal. The division was untried but well-trained.
* 17th Indian Infantry Division under Major-General &#x27;Punch&#x27; Cowan occupied Tiddim, south of Imphal, at the end of a long and precarious line of communication. The division, which had two brigades only, had been intermittently in action since December 1941.
* 23rd Indian Infantry Division under Major-General Ouvry Roberts was in reserve in and around Imphal. It had served on the Imphal front for two years and was severely understrength as a result of endemic diseases such as malaria and typhus.
* 50th Indian Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Maxwell Hope-Thompson was north of Imphal, conducting advanced jungle training.
* 254th Indian Tank Brigade under Brigadier R. L. Scoones, with one British armoured regiment with M3 Lee tanks and one Indian armoured regiment with Stuart light tanks, was stationed in and around Imphal.

The Indian divisions were composed of both British and Indian personnel. In each brigade, there was generally one British, one Gurkha and one Indian battalion, although two brigades (37th Brigade in 23rd Division and 63rd Brigade in 17th Division) were composed entirely of Gurkha units. Each division was supported by two field artillery regiments (usually British) and one Indian mountain artillery regiment.

===Prelude to the operation===
In late February, a local Japanese counterattack was launched against Indian XV Corps in Arakan, using much the same tactics as Mutaguchi proposed to use. The engagement became known to the Allies as the Battle of the Admin Box, the &quot;box&quot; being the supply area for the brigades of the 7th Division. The attack failed as Allied aircraft were able to parachute supplies to the cut-off troops, allowing them to stand firm, while the Japanese who had infiltrated behind them ran out of supplies. From this point onwards, the Allies were to rely increasingly on their transport aircraft. Also, the Japanese unexpectedly encountered tanks, to which the lightly equipped infiltrators had little counter. The planning of U-Go, however, was too far advanced to take account of these developments.

Even as the Japanese prepared to launch their attack, the Allies launched the airborne phase (Operation Thursday) of the second Chindit expedition on 5 March 1944. Japanese officers such as Major-General Noburo Tazoe, commanding the Japanese Army Air Force units in Burma, urged Mutaguchi to divert troops from his offensive to secure the Japanese rear areas against the Chindits. Mutaguchi dismissed these concerns, claiming that in a few weeks he would occupy the air bases from which the Chindits were supplied.

==Opening phases of the battle==
When they received intelligence that a major Japanese offensive was impending, Slim and Scoones planned to withdraw their forward divisions into the Imphal plain and force the Japanese to fight at the end of impossibly long and difficult lines of communication. However, they misjudged the date on which the Japanese were to attack, and the strength they would use against some objectives. The Japanese troops began to cross the Chindwin River on 8 March. Scoones gave his forward divisions orders to withdraw to Imphal only on 13 March.

===Tamu–Shenam===
The 20th Indian Division held Tamu near the Chindwin, and Moreh a short distance to the north, where a large supply dump had been established. On 20 March, there was a clash between six Lee medium tanks of the 3rd Carabiniers and six Type 95 Ha-Go tanks leading Yamamoto&#x27;s advance from the south. The lighter Japanese tanks were destroyed. Acting major-general Douglas Gracey was opposed to making any retreat, but on 25 March he was ordered to detach some of his division to provide a reserve for IV Corps. As this left the division too weak to hold Tamu and Moreh, they withdrew to the Shenam Saddle, a complex of hills through which the Imphal-Tamu road ran. The supply dump at Moreh was set ablaze, and 200 cattle there were slaughtered. The division fell back without difficulty, mainly because two of Yamamoto Force&#x27;s battalions from the Japanese 15th Division (II/51 Regiment and III/60 Regiment) were delayed at Indaw in northern Burma by the Chindits and were unable to intervene.

===Tiddim–Bishenpur===
Further south, the 17th Indian Division was cut off by the Japanese 33rd Division. Patrols from the division and from V Force (an irregular force of locally raised levies and guerrillas) warned Cowan of a Japanese force advancing against the rear of the division as early as 8 March, allowing Cowan to regroup the division to protect its rear. On 13 March, the Japanese 215th Regiment attacked a supply dump at milestone 109, twenty miles behind Cowan&#x27;s leading outposts, while the Japanese 214th Regiment seized Tongzang and a ridge named Tuitum Saddle across the road a few miles behind the 17th Indian Division&#x27;s main position.

The Indian division began to withdraw on 14 March. At Tuitum Saddle, the Japanese 214th Regiment were unable to dig in properly before they were attacked by the 48th Indian Infantry Brigade on 15 March. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and were forced away from the road. Further north, the Japanese captured the depot at Milestone 109 on 18 March, but Indian troops recovered it on 25 March. Cowan had taken steps to secure the most vulnerable point in the rear of his division, the bridge over the Manipur River. The division&#x27;s rearguard crossed safely on 26 March, demolishing the bridge behind them. The division removed most of the vehicles, food and ammunition from the depot at Milestone 109 before resuming their retreat.

Both the Japanese and the Indian division had suffered heavy casualties. Yanagida, the Japanese 33rd Division&#x27;s commander, was already pessimistic, and was apparently unnerved by a garbled radio message which suggested that one of his regiments had been destroyed at Tongzang. He therefore did not press the pursuit against the 17th Division, and advanced cautiously in spite of reprimands from Mutaguchi.

Scoones had nevertheless been forced to send the bulk of his only reserve, the 23rd Indian Infantry Division, to the aid of the 17th Division. The two divisions, supplied by parachute drops from Allied aircraft, made their way back to the Imphal plain, which they reached on 4 April.

===Sangshak–Litan===
Meanwhile, Imphal had been left vulnerable to the Japanese 15th Division. The only force left covering the northern approaches to the base, the Indian 50th Parachute Brigade, was roughly handled in the Battle of Sangshak by a regiment from the Japanese 31st Division on its way to Kohima. The Japanese 60th Regiment cut the main road a few miles north of Imphal on 28 March, while the 51st Regiment advanced on Imphal from the north-east, down the valley of the Iril River and a track from Litan, north-east of Imphal.

However, the earlier diversionary attack launched by Japanese 55th Division in Arakan had already failed. Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander in chief of the Allied South East Asia Command, had taken steps to secure aircraft normally assigned to the &quot;Hump&quot;. Slim was able to use these to move the battle-hardened 5th Indian Infantry Division, including all its artillery and first-line transport (jeeps and mules), by air from Arakan to the Central Front. The move was completed in only eleven days. One brigade and a mountain artillery regiment went to Dimapur in the Brahmaputra valley, but the other two brigades, the field artillery and the divisional HQ went to Imphal. The leading troops of the division were in action north and east of Imphal on 3 April.

===Chin Hills===
On the Japanese left flank, the INA&#x27;s Subhas Brigade, led by Shah Nawaz Khan, reached the edge of the Chin Hills below Tiddim and Fort White at the end of March. From this position, the 2nd Battalion sent companies to relieve Japanese forces at Falam and to Hakha, from where in turn Khan&#x27;s forces sent out patrols and laid ambushes for the Chin guerrillas under the command of a British officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Oates, taking a number of prisoners. In the middle of May, a force under Khan&#x27;s Adjutant, Mahboob &quot;Boobie&quot; Ahmed, attacked and captured the hilltop fortress of Klang Klang. The 3rd Battalion meanwhile moved to Fort White-Tongzang area in premature anticipation of the destruction of Major General Frank Messervy&#x27;s 7th Indian Infantry Division in the Arakan, which would allow it to receive volunteers.

During the early part of the offensive, the &quot;Bahadur Group&quot; of the INA apparently achieved some success in inducing British Indian soldiers to desert.

==Stalemate==
From the beginning of April, the Japanese attacked the Imphal Plain from several directions:

===Bishenpur===
The Japanese 33rd Division attacked from the south at Bishenpur, where they cut a secondary track from Silchar into the plain. A commando raid destroyed a suspension bridge, making the Silchar track unusable. The 17th and 23rd Indian Divisions were regrouping after their retreat, and Bishenpur was only held by the 32nd Indian Infantry Brigade (detached from 20th Division). The Japanese advanced through the hills to the west of Bishenpur, almost isolating the British in the village, but suffered severely from British artillery fire. Their leading troops were halted by lack of supply only from Imphal. Other Japanese advancing directly up the Tiddim-Imphal road were halted in Potsangbam south of Bishenpur, as troops of 17th Indian Division rejoined the battle.

Yanagida, the Japanese division&#x27;s commander, had already infuriated Mutaguchi by his caution. He was finally relieved of command at the end of the month.

===Shenam–Palel===

&quot;Yamamoto Force&quot; attacked the Shenam Saddle, defended by the main body of the Indian 20th Division, on the main road from Tamu into Imphal. This was the only metalled road the Japanese could use, and it was vital for them to break through to allow Yamamoto&#x27;s tanks and heavy artillery to attack the main defences around Imphal itself. Only a few miles north of the saddle was Palel airfield, one of the only two all-weather airfields in the plain, and vital to the defenders.

A Japanese attack up the road on 4 April was disjointed; the infantry were not ready to take part and twelve Japanese tanks were caught exposed on the road by British anti-tank guns. From 8 to 22 April, there was heavy fighting for five peaks which commanded the road east of the Saddle. The Japanese captured a number of them, but Indian and British counter-attacks regained some of those initially lost. Casualties were heavy on both sides.

Having failed to break through using the road, Yamamoto sent some troops through the rough terrain to the north of the Saddle to raid Palel airfield. The INA&#x27;s Gandhi Brigade or 2nd Guerrilla Regiment, of two battalions led by Inayat Kiyani, took part in this attack. On 28 April, they attacked Palel. They tried to induce some Indian defenders to surrender, but the defenders rallied after initial hesitation. Another INA detachment carried out demolitions around Palel, but withdrew after they failed to rendezvous with Japanese units. The Gandhi Brigade was short of rations, having brought forward only one day&#x27;s supplies, and also suffered 250 casualties to shellfire after they pulled back from Palel.

===Kanglatongbi–Nungshigum===
The Japanese 15th Division encircled Imphal from the north. Its 60th Regiment captured a British supply dump at Kanglatongbi on the main Imphal-Dimapur road a few miles north of Imphal, but the depot had been emptied of food and ammunition.

A battalion of the Japanese 51st Regiment (which was commanded by Colonel Kimio Omoto) seized the vital Nungshigum Ridge, which overlooked the main airstrip at Imphal. This was a major threat to IV Corps and on 13 April the 5th Indian Division counter-attacked, supported by air strikes, massed artillery and the M3 Lee tanks of B Squadron of the 3rd Carabiniers. The Japanese had expected that the slopes were too steep for tanks to climb, and indeed Lee tanks had never been tried before on such gradients in action. The Japanese regiment had very few effective anti-tank weapons, and their troops were driven from the ridge with heavy casualties. The attackers also lost heavily; every officer of the Carabiniers and the attacking infantry (1st Bn, the 17th Dogra Regiment) was killed or wounded.

==Allied counter-attacks==

===North===
By 1 May, all Japanese attacks had come to a halt. Slim and Scoones began a counter-offensive against the Japanese 15th Division. This division was the weakest of the Japanese formations, and if it was defeated, the siege would be broken (once Kohima was recaptured). The progress of the counter-attack was slow. The monsoon had broken, making movement very difficult. Also, IV Corps was suffering some shortages. Although rations and reinforcements were delivered to Imphal by air, artillery ammunition had to be conserved.
The 5th Indian Division (joined by the 89th Indian Infantry Brigade which was flown in to replace the brigade sent to Kohima) and 23rd Indian Division (later replaced by the 20th Division) tried capturing the steep ridges, such as the Mapao Spur, held by the Japanese, but found these to be almost impregnable. Allied artillery was usually unable to hit Japanese positions on the reverse slopes, and the troops often stormed the summits of the ridges, only to be driven off by mortar fire and grenades from the reverse slope positions. IV Corps regrouped. The 23rd Indian Division took over the defence of the Shenam Saddle, while from the end of May, 5th Division concentrated on driving north from Sengmai up the main road through Kanglatongi, while the 20th Indian Division advanced along the tracks and the Iril River toward Litan and Ukhrul, threatening the Japanese 15th Division&#x27;s lines of communication.

By this time, the Japanese were at the end of their endurance. Neither the 31st Division which was fighting at Kohima nor the 15th Division had received adequate supplies since the offensive began, and their troops were starving. Lieutenant General Sato, the commander of the Japanese 31st Division, ordered a retreat at the end of May, so that his division could find food. This allowed Indian XXXIII Corps to drive the Japanese from Kohima, and advance south.

The troops of Japanese 15th Division were forced to abandon their defensive positions to scavenge for supplies in local villages or on the Japanese lines of communication. Mutaguchi dismissed the mortally ill Yamauchi (replacing him with Lieutenant General Uichi Shibata) but this did not change matters. After driving rearguards from the &quot;Miyazaki Group&quot; (an independent detachment from the 31st Division) and the Japanese 60th Regiment from their delaying positions on the Dimapur-Imphal road, the leading troops of IV Corps and XXXIII Corps met at Milestone 109, north of Imphal, on 22 June, and the siege of Imphal was raised.

===South===
South of Imphal, 17th Indian Division had moved back into the line, facing the Japanese 33rd Division. During the first half of May, there were several Japanese air attacks on Bishenpur, and heavy fighting for the village of Potsangbam to the south, in which the British lost 12 tanks. The surviving crews of the 3rd Carabiniers were later flown out of Imphal to be reconstituted in India.

Major General Cowan planned to break the deadlock on this front by sending the 48th Indian Infantry Brigade on a wide left hook into the Japanese division&#x27;s rear while 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade attacked them in front. The Japanese division&#x27;s temporary commander (its Chief of Staff, Major General Tetsujiro Tanaka) planned at the same time to infiltrate through Indian 17th Division&#x27;s front to seize vital objectives in the middle of the Indian positions. Both moves were launched almost simultaneously.

The Gurkhas of 48th Indian Brigade cut the road behind the Japanese on 18 May, but 63rd Indian Brigade were unable to break through to them, and 48th Brigade was forced to fight its way through the Japanese positions to rejoin the division, with heavy losses. Meanwhile, some of Tanaka&#x27;s troops (the 214th Regiment) captured hills close to 17th Division&#x27;s headquarters on 20 May. Because of the incursion into their own rear, the Japanese were unable to reinforce their forward troops, and over the following week the isolated Japanese were driven from their positions in the middle of the Indian division, many parties being wiped out.

A new forceful commander, Lieutenant General Nobuo Tanaka, took command of the 33rd Division on 22 May, and ordered repeated attacks which reduced many of his division&#x27;s battalions to mere handfuls of men. In June, he received reinforcements (a regiment from the Japanese 53rd Division, and a detachment from the 14th Tank Regiment) and used them to launch another attack. After initial success, the fresh regiment suffered heavy casualties from shellfire. By the end of June, the 33rd Division had suffered so many casualties that they could make no further effort.

Yamamoto Force had also suffered heavy casualties, but before withdrawing, they launched two modest raids on Palel Airfield in the first week of July, destroying several parked aircraft.

===INA operations===
Towards the end of May, the INA&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Guerrilla Regiments (the latter commanded by Malik Munawar Khan Awan) had been redirected to Kohima. They moved north across the Japanese rear but by the time they reached Ukhrul, the Japanese had already begun to withdraw. They decided to attack Imphal instead. At Imphal, both units suffered some desertions, but not on the scale that the Commonwealth forces expected.

==End of the battle==

The Japanese had realised that the operation ought to be broken off as early as May. Lieutenant General Hikosaburo Hata, the Vice-Chief of the General Staff, had made a tour of inspection of Southern Army&#x27;s headquarters in late April. When he returned to Tokyo, he reported pessimistically on the outcome of the operation at a large staff meeting to Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, but Tojo dismissed his concerns as their source was a junior staff officer (Major Masaru Ushiro, at Burma Area Army HQ). Messages were sent from Imperial Headquarters, urging that the operation was to be fought to the end.

Lieutenant General Kawabe travelled north from Rangoon to see the situation for himself on 25 May. Several officers whom he interviewed expressed confidence in success if reinforcements could be provided, but actually concealed their losses and the seriousness of the situation. At a meeting between Mutaguchi and Kawabe on 6 June, both used &quot;haragei&quot;, an unspoken form of communication using gesture, expression and tone of voice, to convey their conviction that success was impossible, but neither of them wished to bear the responsibility of ordering a retreat. Kawabe subsequently became ill with dysentery and perhaps physically unfit for duty. He nevertheless ordered repeated attacks, stating later that Bose was the key to Japan&#x27;s and India&#x27;s future.

Mutaguchi ordered the Japanese 31st Division, which had retreated from Kohima when threatened with starvation, to join the 15th Division in a renewed attack on Imphal from the north. Neither division obeyed the order, being in no condition to comply. When he realised that none of his formations were obeying his orders to attack, Mutaguchi finally ordered the offensive to be broken off on 3 July. The Japanese, reduced in many cases to a rabble, fell back to the Chindwin, abandoning their artillery, transport, and many soldiers too badly wounded or sick to walk. The Allies recovered Tamu at the end of July. It was found to contain 550 unburied Japanese corpses, with over 100 more severely-wounded Japanese soldiers slowly dying amongst them.

==Casualties==
The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest up until that time. They had suffered 54,879 casualties, including 13,376 dead (plus 920 casualties in the preliminary battles in Assam). Most of these losses were the result of starvation, disease and exhaustion.

The Allies suffered 12,603 casualties.

==Aftermath==
The Japanese had also lost almost every one of the 12,000 pack horses and mules in their transport units and the 30,000 cattle used either as beasts of burden or as rations, and many trucks and other vehicles. The loss of pack animals was to cripple several of their divisions during the following year. Mutaguchi had sacked all of his divisions&#x27; commanders during the battle. Both he and Kawabe were themselves subsequently relieved of command.

In December, Slim and three of his corps commanders (Scoones, Christison and Stopford) were knighted by the viceroy Lord Wavell, at a ceremony at Imphal in front of Scottish, Gurkha and Punjab regiments. Slim was created KCB, the others were made KBEs.

==Air operations at Imphal==

By mid-1944, the Allied air forces enjoyed undisputed air supremacy over Burma. The last major effort by the Japanese Army Air Force had been over the Arakan in February and March, when they had suffered severe losses. During the Imphal and Kohima battles, they were able to make barely half a dozen significant raids.

IV Corps enjoyed close air support from fighter-bombers and dive bombers of 221 Group of the RAF. Allied fighter bombers and medium bombers shot up and bombed enemy concentrations, supply dumps, transport, roads and bridges all the way to the Chindwin river. The monsoon, which occurred every year from May to September, in no way diminished their activity. The RAF Third Tactical Air Force flew 24,000 sorties during the worst four months of the monsoon, nearly six times the previous year&#x27;s record.

The most important contribution to the Allied victory was made by British and American transport aircraft. The Allies could fly men, equipment and supplies into the airstrips at Imphal (and Pallel also, until the onset of the monsoon rains), so, although cut off by land, the town had a lifeline. By the end of the battle, the Allied air forces had flown 19,000 tons of supplies and 12,000 men into Kohima and Imphal, and flown out 13,000 casualties and 43,000 non-combatants. They delivered over a million gallons of fuel, over a thousand bags of mail and 40 million cigarettes. Several thousand mules were used to supply outlying outposts, for example, 17th Indian Division on the Bishenpur trail, so animal fodder was also flown in during the siege. Allied aircraft parachuted ammunition, rations and drinking water to surrounded units.

At the start of the battle, South East Asia Command had 76 transport aircraft (mainly C-47 Skytrain) available, but many others were dedicated to supplying the Nationalist Chinese under Chiang Kai-Shek, or to establishing USAAF bomber bases in China, via &quot;the hump&quot;. Not even Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the Commander-in-Chief, had the authority to commandeer any of these aircraft, but at the crisis of the battle in the middle of March he nevertheless did so, acquiring 20 C-46 Commando aircraft (equivalent to another 30 C-47s). He was supported by American officers at SEAC and the American China-Burma-India Theater headquarters.

==War cemetery==
After the war, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission set up Imphal War Cemetery and Kohima War Cemetery to commemorate the British and the Indian soldiers who died during the Second World War.

<text>The Meta key is a modifier key on certain keyboards. It first appeared on the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) keyboard in 1970.

== History ==
The Meta key first appeared on the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) keyboard in 1970 and successors such as the Knight keyboard, space-cadet keyboard, MIT Lisp machine, Symbolics keyboards, and on Sun Microsystems keyboards (where it is marked with a black diamond &quot;◆&quot;).

== Use ==

Generally, the Meta key worked similar to Macintosh&#x27;s Command key, in that when held down it modified letters and symbols into immediate commands (shortcuts). On these keyboards the Control key was placed closest to the space bar, then the Meta key outside Control. The space-cadet keyboard added the Super key outside Meta, and the Hyper key outside that. All these keys produced shortcuts (24-1 of them for every letter), but the Control ones were easiest to type and most popular, and the Meta ones second-easiest and thus second most popular. However, on most modern keyboards, the Control key is &quot;farthest&quot; from the space bar, reversing the convenience of shortcuts.

On keyboards that lack a physical Meta key, its functionality may be invoked by other keys such as the Windows key or Macintosh&#x27;s Option key. However, software often provides another workaround, such as using the Alt key (which does not exist on the Knight keyboard), or using the Esc key as a prefix (e.g., in Emacs). Because of these workarounds, the need for Meta – despite being the most-used additional modifier key – was less than for other modifier keys. It is more common today to use the Windows key to emulate the Super key.

<doc id="1003242" wikidata="Q4491933" url="?curid=1003242" title="Rodrigues' formula">
<text>In mathematics, Rodrigues&#x27; formula (formerly called the Ivory–Jacobi formula) generates the Legendre polynomials. It was independently introduced by , and . The name &quot;Rodrigues formula&quot; was introduced by Heine in 1878, after Hermite pointed out in 1865 that Rodrigues was the first to discover it. The term is also used to describe similar formulas for other orthogonal polynomials. describes the history of the Rodrigues formula in detail.

==Statement==
Let formula_1 be a sequence of orthogonal polynomials defined on the interval formula_2 satisfying the orthogonality condition 
formula_3
where formula_4 is a suitable weight function, formula_5 is a constant depending on formula_6, and formula_7 is the Kronecker delta. The weight function w(x)=W(x)/B(x) where the integration factor W(x) satisfies the equation 
formula_8
where formula_9 is a polynomial with degree at most 1 and formula_10 is a polynomial with degree at most 2. For instance, for the Legendre polynomials, B(x)=1-x*x and A(x)=-2x. This gives W(x)=1-x*x and w(x)=1. Further, the limits
formula_11
Then it can be shown that formula_12 satisfies a relation of the form,
formula_13
for some constants formula_14. This relation is called &quot;Rodrigues&#x27; type formula&quot;, or just &quot;Rodrigues&#x27; formula&quot;.

Polynomials obtained from Rodrigues&#x27; formula obey the second order differential equation for the classical orthogonal polynomials

formula_15

formula_16

The second derivative of B(x) and first derivative of A(x) are constants. Continuing the example of the Legendre polynomials,

formula_17

===Differential equation proof===
The following proof shows that the polynomials obtained from the Rodrigues&#x27; formula obey the second order differential equation just given. This proof repeatedly uses the fact that the second derivative of B(x) and the first derivative of A(x) are constants. Using

formula_18

the differential equation that we are to prove may be put in the form

formula_19

formula_20

This is equivalent to

formula_21

This is the differential equation that we will prove to be true. We will do so using the following two identities that move B(x) and A(x) to the other side of the formula_22 derivative

formula_23

formula_24

formula_25

The second order, first order, and zero-th order derivatives have the respective forms
formula_26, formula_27, formula_28.

formula_29

formula_30

formula_31

formula_32 has three terms, call them in order formula_33, formula_34, and formula_35. formula_36 has two terms, call them in order formula_37 and formula_38. The sum formula_39 is zero. The sum formula_40 is zero provided that formula_41 is given by the equation given earlier. Done.

===Generating functions===
Rodrigues’ formula together with Cauchy’s Residue theorem for complex integration on a closed path enclosing poles gives the generating functions having the property formula_42 Here&#x27;s how:

By Cauchy’s Residue Theorem, Rodrigues’ formula is equivalent to

formula_43
where the complex variable t is integrated along a counterclockwise closed path C that encircles x. Make the change of variable

formula_44

Then the complex path integral takes the form

formula_45

formula_46

where now the closed path C encircles the origin. In the equation for formula_47, formula_48 is an implicit function of formula_49. As examples, we will find the generating functions for the Hermite polynomials and the Legendre polynomials.

The Hermite polynomials are particularly easy: 

formula_50

formula_51

formula_52

formula_53

formula_54

formula_55

The generating function is

formula_56

where formula_57 are the Hermite polynomials. If we replace formula_49 by formula_59 and formula_57 by formula_61, we get the usual generating function relationship.

The Legendre polynomials require more work. 

formula_62

formula_63 

formula_64

formula_65

The last equation implicitly gives formula_48 as a function of formula_49. We find

formula_68

formula_69

Then

formula_70

formula_71

formula_72

If we replace formula_49 by formula_74 and formula_12 by formula_76, we get the generating function relation in the usual form.

===Applications===
The most known applications of Rodrigues&#x27; type formulas are the formulas for Legendre, Laguerre and Hermite polynomials:

Rodrigues stated his formula for Legendre polynomials formula_77:
formula_78

Laguerre polynomials are usually denoted &quot;L&quot;0, &quot;L&quot;1, ..., and the Rodrigues formula can be written as
formula_79

The Rodrigues formula for the Hermite polynomials can be written as
formula_80

Similar formulae hold for many other sequences of orthogonal functions arising from Sturm–Liouville equations, and these are also called the Rodrigues formula (or Rodrigues&#x27; type formula) for that case, especially when the resulting sequence is polynomial.

<text>Jure Robič (; , Jesenice, Slovenia – , Plavški Rovt) was a Slovenian cyclist and a soldier in the Slovenian Army. He became prominent for his multiple wins in the men&#x27;s solo category of Race Across America (RAAM). He died on in a head-on collision during training. He was descending on his bike on a narrow mountain forest road in Plavški Rovt near Jesenice in Slovenia and hit an oncoming car.

Robič won the Race Across America (RAAM) 5 times (then a record in the men&#x27;s solo category): in 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2010. He was in the second place at the final time station in 2009, but dropped out of the race in protest against what he found to be unfair time penalties awarded against him. For example, he received a time penalty for urinating in a non-designated place on the start day of the race, before the race even started. Robič swore never to enter RAAM again, but changed his mind and came back and won again in 2010.

On , Robič broke the world 24-hour road record by cycling non-stop. In 2005, he won Le Tour Direct, (7d 19h 40m) a race on a course derived from classic Tour de France routes. Robič won the DOS-Ras Race Across Slovenia four times, the Tour Direct twice, and the Tortour in 2010.

Robič was renowned for pushing himself to extreme mental breakdown and hallucinations, sleeping less than 90 minutes per day during endurance races. He was laboratory-tested, and his abilities to produce power and to transport oxygen were found matching those of other top ultra-endurance champions worldwide. During the 2004 Race Across America, it was reported that he only slept for a total of eight hours during his eight-day, ride across the United States.

From 1988 to 1994, Robič was a member of the Slovenian National Cycling Team. During that time, he was also a Slovenian national road champion. In his career he won more than 100 races and was on the podium at least 150 times. He was also a winner of Maraton Franja, Juriš na Vršič.

In addition to achievements in races, Robič was the recipient of the Sportsman of the Year awards for special achievements, Slovenian of the year for special achievements, and awards for fair play and tolerance in sport.

<text>John Randolph Thune ( ; born January 7, 1961) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from South Dakota, since 2005. A member of the Republican Party, he has been the Senate majority leader and Senate Republican leader since 2025. Thune is in his fourth Senate term and is the dean of South Dakota&#x27;s congressional delegation. From 1997 to 2003, he served three terms as the U.S. representative for .

Thune has worked in politics and civic organizations since completing his MBA degree. He first ran for the U.S. Senate in 2002, losing to incumbent Senator Tim Johnson. In 2004, he defeated Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. In the Senate, Thune served as the Republican chief deputy whip from 2007 to 2009 and chaired the Senate Republican Policy Committee from 2009 to 2012. He served as the Senate Republican Conference chair, the third-ranking position in the Senate, from 2012 to 2019.

The Senate Republican Conference selected Thune as the majority whip for the 116th Congress; he succeeded Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who was term-limited in the position. In 2020, he was chosen as minority whip for the 117th Congress. In 2024, he was elected Senate Republican leader, succeeding Mitch McConnell. Thune is the first Senate party leader to have originally taken office as a senator in the 21st century.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Thune was born in Pierre, South Dakota, the son of Yvonne Patricia (née Bodine) and Harold Richard Thune. Harold Thune was a fighter pilot in the Pacific theater during World War II who flew the Grumman F6F Hellcat; he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after shooting down four enemy planes. Harold Thune flew his missions off the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;. Thune&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Nicholas Thune, was an immigrant from Norway who partnered with his brother to start Thune Hardware stores in Mitchell and Murdo, South Dakota. Thune&#x27;s maternal grandfather was from Ontario, Canada, and his mother was born in Saskatchewan.

Thune was a star athlete in high school, active in basketball, track, and football. He graduated from Jones County High School in 1979. He played college basketball at Biola University in California, from which he graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business. Thune received a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of South Dakota in 1984.

After completing his MBA, Thune became involved in politics. He worked as a legislative aide for U.S. Senator James Abdnor from 1985 to 1987. In 1989, Thune moved to Pierre, where he served as executive director of the state Republican Party for two years. Thune was appointed Railroad Director of South Dakota by Governor George S. Mickelson and served from 1991 to 1993. From 1993 to 1996, he was executive director of the South Dakota Municipal League.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1997–2003)==

===Elections===
Thune began his political career in 1996 by entering the race for South Dakota&#x27;s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; said that Thune &quot;entered the 1996 race as very much an underdog.&quot; His opponent in the Republican primary was sitting Lieutenant Governor Carole Hillard of Rapid City, who benefited from the support of the longtime South Dakota Governor Bill Janklow. A May 1996 poll showed Hillard leading Thune by a margin of 69%–15%. By relying on strong personal skills and the help of his old network of Abdnor friends, Thune won the primary, defeating Hillard 59%–41%. In the general election, Thune defeated Democrat Rick Weiland, a long-serving aide to U.S. Senator Tom Daschle, 58%–37%. Thune won his subsequent races for U.S. House by wide margins. He was reelected in 1998 with 75% of the vote, and in 2000 with 73% of the vote.

==U.S. Senate (2005–present)==
===Elections===

====2002====
In 2002, after briefly considering a run for governor, Thune set his sights on the U.S. Senate. He ran against incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Tim Johnson and lost by only 524 votes (0.15%). One study concluded: &quot;While the margin of victory [for Johnson] was a mere 524 votes, getting into that winning position required a number of important factors, including Native American turnout, the ability of Johnson and his allies to more effectively use the ground war to get their message out, Thune&#x27;s ineffectiveness on the air and lack of experience in winning competitive elections, low voter turnout in key Republican counties, the drought, and finally the presence of Kurt Evans. Evans, a Libertarian candidate who withdrew from the race, endorsed Thune, but remained on the ballot and siphoned away more votes from Thune than Johnson. Evans received only 3,070 votes, but that ended up being six times greater than the margin of victory.&quot; Despite the close results, Thune did not contest the election.

====2004====

In 2004 Thune challenged Tom Daschle, the United States Senate Minority Leader and leader of the Senate Democrats. In early 2003, Daschle had unexpectedly decided not to run for president. CNN reported that the &quot;announcement surprised even some of his closest aides, one of whom told CNN plans were being made for Daschle to announce his candidacy Saturday in his hometown of Aberdeen, South Dakota.&quot;

The 2004 U.S. Senate race in South Dakota was the most expensive Senate race that year, with a total of $30 million spent, and the most expensive race in South Dakota history. It was widely followed in the national media. Thune, along with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, President George W. Bush, and Vice President Dick Cheney, described Daschle as the &quot;chief obstructionist&quot; of Bush&#x27;s agenda. &quot;Thune was able to criticize &#x27;Daschle for serving incompatible masters&#x27; and portray him, as Frist did when he came to South Dakota to campaign for Thune, as a partisan obstructionist and political heir to liberal icon and former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.&quot;

Daschle&#x27;s critics charged the Democrat with using filibusters to block confirmation of several of Bush&#x27;s nominees to the federal judiciary and of being out of step with South Dakota voters on other political and social issues: &quot;The GOP had targeted Daschle, the Senate minority leader, claiming he had been the chief obstruction to President Bush on such issues as tax cuts, judicial nominees and the war in Iraq.&quot;

On November 2, 2004, Thune defeated Daschle by 4,508 votes, winning 51% of the vote. Daschle&#x27;s loss was the first ousting of an incumbent floor leader since 1952, when Arizona Senator Ernest McFarland lost to Barry Goldwater. The loss made Daschle &quot;the first Senate party leader in more than five decades to be voted out of office&quot;.

South Dakota native Tom Brokaw commented that Thune &quot;ran a very strong campaign&quot; to win the 2004 race. University of South Dakota political scientist Bill Richardson said, &quot;motivated John Thune supporters went to the polls in large numbers, part of a massive South Dakota turnout. Unofficial results show nearly 80 percent of registered voters cast ballots.&quot; After Thune defeated Daschle, many Republicans regarded him as a &quot;rising star with unlimited political potential&quot;.

====2010====

Thune was reelected without any opposition in either the primary or general election. Scott Heidepriem, the South Dakota Senate Minority Leader and a Democratic candidate for Governor of South Dakota, said, &quot;We just concluded that John Thune is an extremely popular senator who is going to win another term in the Senate.&quot; The conservative publication &quot;Townhall&quot; commented that the absence of a Democratic candidate in the election marked &quot;the first time in the state&#x27;s modern history in which a major party has failed to field a Senate candidate&quot;.

====2016====

Thune faced Democratic nominee Jay Williams, chair of the Yankton County Democratic Party. On November 8, he defeated Williams with 71.8% of the vote.

====2022====

Thune &quot;drew the wrath of Donald Trump for pushing back on the former president&#x27;s false claims&quot; that he won the 2020 presidential election. Trump called upon South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to launch a primary challenge to Thune in the 2022 U.S. Senate election in South Dakota; Noem declined. Thune also received negative feedback from Trump supporters for his position on the 2020 election. While Thune seriously considered retiring from the Senate, he announced in January 2022 that he would seek reelection to a fourth term. He was reelected with 69.6% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Brian Bengs.

===Tenure===
On December 6, 2006, Thune was chosen by Senate Republican Whip Trent Lott to be the GOP&#x27;s Chief Deputy Whip. After briefly serving as Republican Conference Vice-Chairman, Thune became chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in June 2009. The post was the fourth-ranking position in the Senate.

In March 2009, Thune was one of 14 senators to vote against a procedural move that essentially guaranteed a major expansion of a national service corps. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would cost at least $418 million in the fiscal year 2010 and $5.7 billion from 2010 to 2014. He was elected Republican Conference Chairman in 2011, taking office in January 2012. The conference chairman is the third-ranking position in the Senate. In late 2011, the &quot;Mitchell Daily Republic&quot; wrote: &quot;Thune&#x27;s elevation to the No. 3 spot makes him the highest-ranking Republican senator in South Dakota history. Thune has served as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 2009 until the present time and was vice chairman of the Republican Conference from 2008 to 2009 and the Republican chief deputy whip from 2006 to 2008.&quot;

Thune&#x27;s emergence as a conservative voice in the Senate gained him a lengthy profile in the conservative magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard.&quot; The American Conservative Union gave Senator Thune a rating of 100 in 2006 and again in 2010. As of 2020 Thune&#x27;s lifetime ACU rating was 84.11. Thune was praised in a 2010 &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; profile as an exceptional politician who was, unlike many of his colleagues, able to communicate traditional conservatism, making him a popular alternative to Tea Party representatives.

In June 2018, Thune called on Special Counsel Robert Mueller to &quot;start winding&quot; down his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Thune is South Dakota&#x27;s senior U.S. senator. The Senate Republican Conference selected him as majority whip for the 116th Congress, succeeding John Cornyn, who was term-limited in the position. He served as minority whip in the 117th Congress and continued to serve as minority whip in the 118th Congress.

====Senate Republican leader====
On November 13, 2024, Thune won the Senate Republican Conference leadership election on the second ballot to become the next Senate majority leader to replace the retiring Mitch McConnell, following the November 2024 U.S. elections, in which Republicans carried the Senate. The other candidates were Rick Scott and John Cornyn. The election occurred in a closed-door Republican caucus setting, and senators&#x27; votes were not publicized. Thune beat Cornyn in the second ballot 29-24.

On January 9, 2025, Thune, representing the Republican Party, spoke at Jimmy Carter&#x27;s funeral service alongside President Joe Biden, Jason Carter and Mayor Muriel Bowser. 

==Political positions==
=== Agriculture ===
In March 2019, Thune was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers &quot;have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices&quot; and urging his department to &quot;strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.&quot;

=== Drug policy ===
In December 2017, Thune was one of six senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requesting their &quot;help in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the 340B program&quot;, a rule mandating that drug companies give discounts to health-care organizations presently serving large numbers of low-income patients.

===Economy===
In January 2019, Thune introduced legislation to repeal the estate tax, which applies to couples with estates above $22.4 million.

=== Education ===
In February 2019, Thune was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Employer Participation in Repayment Act, enabling employers to contribute up to $5,250 to their employees&#x27; student loans.

===Energy===

On March 6, 2014, Thune introduced the Reliable Home Heating Act (S. 2086; 113th Congress). The bill would require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to exempt motor carriers that transport home heating oil from numerous federal safety regulations if the governor of a state declares a state of emergency caused by a shortage of residential heating fuel. The bill also would require the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to notify states if certain petroleum reserves fall below historical averages.

=== Environment ===
In March 2019, Thune joined all Senate Republicans, three Democrats, and Angus King in voting against the Green New Deal resolution. Arguing against its implementation, Thune said the resolution would &quot;absolutely be devastating and disastrous&quot; for the agriculture economy both in South Dakota and across the US.

===Facebook===
In May 2016, Thune sent Facebook a letter requesting details on how it operates its Trending Topics feature, after a Gizmodo article cited anonymous sources (claiming to be former Facebook employees) who alleged systemic anti-conservative political bias in how material is selected for display in the list. Some commentators criticized Thune&#x27;s letter as an example of government overreach against a private company. Facebook denied the bias allegations. Thune thanked Facebook in a public statement.

=== Foreign policy ===

In November 2006, Thune said he believed the US could win the Iraq War through stability. He elaborated, &quot;It&#x27;s making sure that Iraq can&#x27;t be a staging ground for terrorist attacks against its neighbors in the region or, worse yet, against the United States.&quot; Thune also espoused the position that the Bush administration and a majority of members of Congress would grant military commanders the final decision on when to reduce U.S. military forces there. In July 2008, Thune said that the Bush administration&#x27;s moves in Iraq had been a &quot;remarkable success&quot;, noting civilian casualties had been reduced by 80 percent, and charged Democratic presidential candidate and Senator Barack Obama with failing &quot;to acknowledge the basic fact of the success and result and progress and gains that have been made as a result of the surge.&quot;

In December 2010, Thune was one of 26 senators who voted against the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years, and providing for a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In November 2012, Thune and Chuck Grassley requested that United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner provide a review of the Chinese company Wanxiang Group&#x27;s plan to acquire bankrupt battery maker A123, arguing that the transaction should be reviewed to ensure that U.S. military and taxpayer interests in A123 were protected. In October 2018, Thune requested staff briefings about a Bloomberg report that the Chinese government had implanted malicious hardware into server motherboards, writing charges that &quot;the U.S. hardware supply chain has been purposely tampered with by a foreign power [and] must be taken seriously.&quot;

In September 2016, Thune was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State John Kerry advocating that the United States use &quot;all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria&quot; from an Iranian airbase near Hamadan and stating that the airstrikes violated &quot;a legally binding Security Council Resolution&quot; on Iran. In June 2017, Thune co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would have made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years&#x27; imprisonment, to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel. In March 2018, Thune voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

In May 2020, a group of Senate Republicans planned to introduce a privacy bill that would regulate the data COVID-19 contact-tracing apps collect. Senator Roger Wicker said the legislation would &quot;hold businesses accountable to consumers if they use personal data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;. Thune said the act would permit the creation of &quot;platforms that could trace the virus and help flatten the curve and stop the spread—and maintaining privacy protections for U.S. citizens&quot;.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Thune said that the Ukrainian people could not sustain the war without military support from the U.S. and other countries. He called on European partners to make robust contributions to help Ukraine.

===Health care===
Thune was part of the group of 13 senators drafting the Senate version of the American Health Care Act of 2017. In July 2017, Thune said that Republicans would continue trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act regardless of whether that month&#x27;s effort collapsed: &quot;We are going to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. It&#x27;s not a question of if, it&#x27;s a question of when.&quot;

===Gun control===
Thune advocates gun rights, sponsoring legislation that would allow individuals with concealed carry permits to use such permits as a valid permit in other states. He also voted against banning standard-capacity magazines of over 10 rounds. On October 3, 2017, Thune became the center of media attention for saying in response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas: &quot;It sounds like [the shooter] used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make the weapons more lethal. We&#x27;ll look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think a lot of us want to do everything we can to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know, it&#x27;s an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do it&#x27;s going to be hard to prevent anything. But I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions. To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said, get small.&quot;
===Judiciary===
In March 2016, about seven months before the next presidential election, Thune declared his opposition to considering President Obama&#x27;s nominee to the Supreme Court, saying that &quot;the next president should make this lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court&quot; because the &quot;American people deserve to have their voices heard on the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice&quot;. In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Thune supported an immediate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death.

=== Trade ===
In January 2018 Thune was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement by modernizing it for the economy of the 21st century. In July 2018, as the Trump administration pushed for aid for agricultural producers affected by retaliatory tariffs, Thune said the plan offered a &quot;false and short-term&quot; sense of security and cited the importance of fair and free trade for South Dakota&#x27;s farmers.

===2020 presidential election results===
In December 2020, Thune said he opposed any further efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results. He argued that such efforts would &quot;go down like a shot dog&quot; in the Senate. Then-President Donald Trump, who contended that the election results were illegitimate and that he had defeated Democratic nominee Joe Biden, responded by attacking Thune on Twitter, and publicly called on South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to challenge him in a 2022 U.S. Senate primary. Thune voted to certify the 2020 presidential election results.

==Presidential and vice-presidential speculation==
Before the selection of Sarah Palin, Thune was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential pick for Republican nominee John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Thune publicly played down the speculation.

Significant speculation arose regarding a potential 2012 presidential bid by Thune. He was encouraged to run by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who called him &quot;a consensus builder&quot;. One &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article stated that Thune had &quot;name ID in the parts of the first caucus state of Iowa that get neighboring South Dakota media, a $6.9 million bank account he could use for a presidential run, and a national fundraising list of 100,000 names from his race against [former Senator Tom] Daschle.&quot; DNC Executive Director Jennifer O&#x27;Malley Dillon publicly said that in a field of generally flawed Republican presidential candidates, Thune was the one she feared. According to multiple commentators, Thune&#x27;s candidacy could be helped by his personal appearance. On February 22, 2011, Thune announced he would not run in 2012.

During the summer of 2012, the &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that Thune was on Mitt Romney&#x27;s short list as a potential running mate but Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan was selected instead. Despite some speculation, Thune also declined to seek the presidency in 2016, saying that his &quot;window ... might have closed in 2012&quot;.

==Electoral history==


==Personal life==

Thune is an evangelical Christian. He married Kimberley Weems of Doland, South Dakota in 1984. The Thunes have two daughters and five grandchildren.

Thune is physically active and has frequently competed in running events. A 2012 &quot;Runner&#x27;s World Magazine&quot; feature called Thune &quot;the fastest man in Congress since 2009.&quot;

Thune is a fan of the bands Styx, Journey, Boston, and the Doobie Brothers.

<doc id="1003259" wikidata="Q7737107" url="?curid=1003259" title="The Golden Shot">
<text>The Golden Shot is a British television game show produced by ATV for ITV between 1 July 1967 and 13 April 1975, based on the German TV show &quot;Der goldene Schuß&quot;. It is most commonly associated with host Bob Monkhouse, but three other presenters also fronted the show. Hostess Anne Aston was on hand to read out the scores achieved by the contestants, and each month a &quot;Maid of the Month&quot;, usually a glamour model of the era, would demonstrate the prizes and announce the contestants. When Bob Monkhouse returned to present the show in 1974, he was joined by co-hostess (to Anne Aston) Wei Wei Wong, who had recently been seen in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and who was an ex-member of the Young Generation and Second Generation dance troupes. This was one of the earliest regular appearances by an East Asian woman on British TV.

The show was broadcast live and used a crossbow attached to a TV camera to shoot a bolt at a target, using the camera as the crossbow&#x27;s viewfinder. The person who loaded the crossbows was referred to by the nickname &quot;Bernie&quot; (or &quot;Heinz&quot; in early episodes), giving rise to the catchphrase &quot;Bernie, the bolt&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The show involved the &quot;Tele-Bow&quot;, a crossbow attached to a television camera guided by a contestant. It shot a bolt at an exploding target embedded in an apple positioned on a topical backdrop (usually an enlargement of Bob&#x27;s own cartoons). In the first round, the crossbow was operated by blindfolded cameraman Derek Chason receiving instructions from a contestant, playing either at home by phone or in the studio from an isolation booth. First-round winners from previous shows would be invited to the studio to compete in pairs using crossbows fitted with butts, sights, and triggers mounted on stands. In later rounds, the contestants operated the crossbow themselves, first by remote control using a joystick, and finally handling the Tele-Bow directly for the ultimate prize. The last and most difficult task was to fire the crossbow bolt to cut a fine thread holding a small door closed. Breaking the thread opened the door, producing a shower of gold coins.

Contestants who successfully negotiated seven (later four) rounds of targets won a reasonable prize; those who missed got a negligible one. Most who reached the final stage operated the Tele-Bow like a rifle, with mixed results. One winner simply stood next to it and used a light touch on the rifle butt, sighting using the TV screen.

In his autobiography, host Bob Monkhouse recounted the story of a person who competed on the show from a telephone kiosk while watching a television in a rental shop over the road. While the contestant was directing the bolt, however, an assistant came in and switched the televisions off or changed the channel.

Another story Monkhouse told was about a priest (who was in the studio audience) audibly praying during the programme that he wouldn&#x27;t get injured by the bolt, only for the bolt to ricochet off the target and land beside the priest.

==Broadcast history==
The show&#x27;s first host was Canadian singer and record producer Jackie Rae. Bob Monkhouse was a guest star on the tenth episode, and his autobiography reveals he did so fully intending to demonstrate to the producers that he should replace Rae as host. The plan worked, and Monkhouse took over as host from the 15th show onward. His quick wit, and willingness to revel in the show&#x27;s chaotic nature led the Monkhouse era to be regarded as the show&#x27;s golden age; by programme 26, the viewing figures were up by 50%. Because the programme was broadcast live (necessary because contestants took part over the telephone), Monkhouse often chatted to the participants to fill in whilst the crossbow was adjusted after the previous round.

In January 1968, the show moved to Sunday afternoons at around 16:40. Michael Grade has claimed that this resulted from a remark he made to his uncle, Lew Grade, ATV&#x27;s deputy chairman and joint managing director, that the cinemas were full on Sunday afternoons because there was nothing to watch on television. However, the Midlands and North weekend franchisee ABC Television had been showing the programme in this slot since late September 1967, so Grade must share the credit with ABC&#x27;s programme controller Brian Tesler. The scheduling change coincided with a move of the production from ATV Elstree near London, to the Alpha Studios at Aston in Birmingham. Audience levels peaked at 16 million. The studio facilities in Birmingham, situated in a converted cinema, were rather run-down and unreliable (they dated from the start of ATV&#x27;s franchise in 1956) and simply not well-suited to a fast-moving live show like &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;; as such, technical failures were common, but Monkhouse was well able to cover for them through his quick-witted humour. From 1970, the show moved to the new ATV Centre in Birmingham. During the ITV Colour Strike of 1970-71, episodes 10 to 21 of series 3 were broadcast in black-and-white. 

In 1972, Monkhouse was spotted accepting a gift from Wilkinson Sword representative Bob Brooksby. The following week, a Wilkinson Sword &quot;his and hers&quot; grooming kit was the bronze prize on the show. ATV&#x27;s production controller Francis Essex suspected collusion and fired Monkhouse, although publicly it was announced that he &quot;was being released to find opportunities for his abilities elsewhere&quot;. The gift was in fact the collectable book &quot;The Shy Photographer&quot; and there was no collusion; however Monkhouse&#x27;s side of the story was not made public until his autobiography &quot;Crying with Laughter&quot; was published in 1993.

The next host was comedian and entertainer Norman Vaughan, who was assisted by regular hostess Anne Aston and for several months &quot;Maid of the Month&quot; Cherri Gilham. In theory, Norman Vaughan was an ideal host for the show but the pressure of the live show seemed to overwhelm him and he was never as confident a host as Monkhouse. Audience figures began to drop and in late 1973, he was replaced by comedian (and former footballer) Charlie Williams along with hostess Wendy King. Williams, of Barbadian ancestry on his father&#x27;s side and Yorkshire on his mother&#x27;s side, was rather a novelty on British TV at the time, being a black man with a broad Yorkshire accent. Despite his cheerfulness and amiability he proved unsuited to handling the pressure of a live TV show where things frequently went wrong. After six months, Williams was also replaced.

On 20 March 1974, Francis Essex met with Bob Monkhouse to invite him back onto the show. Monkhouse had no hesitation in accepting the offer, though, his agent negotiated that he would only return if ATV took up an option on the American game show &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. This was agreed, and Monkhouse returned as host of the new season of &quot;The Golden Shot&quot; on 14 July 1974. It was complete with a new theme song, &quot;Golden Day&quot;, written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue and sung by Stephanie de Sykes and Rain. Very soon it was obvious that the show was back at its peak however, the last edition of the show was transmitted on 13 April 1975, with Monkhouse, Vaughan and Williams all hosting it together. ATV felt that the show had a long successful run, and it was retiring various old shows to make way for new ones, including Monkhouse&#x27;s version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, which debuted on 20 July 1975.

===Bernie, the bolt!===
The show&#x27;s catchphrase became &quot;Bernie, the bolt!&quot; (originally &quot;Heinz, the bolt!&quot;, as Heinz had been brought over from Germany when the show was imported). The instruction was from the host to the armourer that the crossbow bolt should be loaded. Three people acted as &quot;Bernie&quot; on the show; Alan Bailey, Derek Young, and Johnny Baker (a film unit grip). There was an element of mystery associated with the crossbow loaders, as they were not introduced by name and said nothing.

===Revivals===
The programme was revived in two forms.

In 1991, the idea was used for the final round, &quot;The Dart Through the Heart&quot;, of the Bob Monkhouse gameshow for newly married couples, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Your Uncle&quot;. The winning couple would compete for a jackpot where one partner was blindfolded and the other guided them in trying to shoot a dart into a heart-shaped target. The armourer for this was female, and introduced by the request, &quot;Donna, the dart&quot;.

On 1 October 2005, as part of their &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; celebrating 50 years of the ITV network, Ant &amp; Dec hosted a one-off revival that was the only edition of the series to be broadcast live. The show was revived again as a one-off on Vernon Kay&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; on 28 April 2007.

==Parodies==
The show was parodied as &quot;The Golden Shoot&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; broadcast 25 December 1969.

<text>The Scottish Parliament Building (; ) is the home of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, within the UNESCO World Heritage Site in central Edinburgh. Construction of the building commenced in June 1999 and the Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) held their first debate in the new building on 7 September 2004. The formal opening by Queen Elizabeth II took place on 9 October 2004. Enric Miralles, the Catalan architect who designed the building, died before its completion.

From 1999 until the opening of the new building in 2004, committee rooms and the debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament were housed in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland located on The Mound in Edinburgh. Office and administrative accommodation in support of the Parliament were provided in buildings leased from the City of Edinburgh Council. The new Scottish Parliament Building brought together these different elements into one purpose-built parliamentary complex, housing 129 MSPs and more than 1,000 staff and civil servants.

From the outset, the building and its construction have been controversial. The choices of location, architect, design and construction company were all criticised by politicians, the media and the Scottish public. Scheduled to open in 2001, it did so in 2004, more than three years late with an estimated final cost of £414 million, many times higher than initial estimates of between £10m and £40m. A major public inquiry into the handling of the construction, chaired by the former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, was established in 2003. The inquiry concluded in September 2004, and criticised the management of the whole project from the realisation of cost increases, down to the way in which major design changes were implemented. 

Despite these criticisms and a mixed public reaction, the building was welcomed by architectural academics and critics. The building aimed to achieve a poetic union between the Scottish landscape, its people, its culture and the city of Edinburgh. The Parliament Building won numerous awards including the 2005 Stirling Prize and has been described by landscape architect Charles Jencks as &quot;a tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last 100 years of British architecture&quot;.

== Location ==

Comprising an area of 1.6 ha (4 acres), with a perimeter of 480 m (1570 ft), the Scottish Parliament Building is located 1 km (0.6 mi) east of Edinburgh city centre on the edge of the Old Town. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the Canongate stretch of the Royal Mile on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern side, where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid&#x27;s Close on its western side. Reid&#x27;s Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex. The south eastern side of the complex is bounded by the Our Dynamic Earth visitor attraction which opened in July 1999, and Queen&#x27;s Drive which fringes the slopes of Salisbury Crags.

In the immediate vicinity of the building is the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which is bordered by the broad expanse of Holyrood Park. To the south of the parliamentary complex are the steep slopes of Salisbury Crags and Arthur&#x27;s Seat. The Holyrood and Dumbiedykes areas, to the west of the site, have been extensively redeveloped since 1998, with new retail, hotel and office developments, including Barclay House, the new offices of The Scotsman Publications Ltd.

== History ==

From to 1707, the Parliament of Scotland served as the national legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland, except for a period during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. For most of its existence, Scotland&#x27;s Parliament did not have a regular meeting place; between 1438 and 1561, it usually met at the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh and from 1538 onwards in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. By the 1630&#x27;s, the Cathedral was becoming inadequate due to the increasing number of Scottish MPs, resulting in the construction of the Parliament House, Edinburgh, which served as Parliament&#x27;s meeting place until the Acts of Union 1707. The act unified the kingdoms of Scotland and England into the Kingdom of Great Britain, dissolving the Scottish and English parliaments and established the Parliament of Great Britain, which was based in London like its English predecessor. As per the terms of the treaty, Scotland sent 16 Scottish representative peers to the House of Lords and 45 MPs to the House of Commons.

On 11 September 1997, amidst an increase in Scottish nationalism, a devolution referendum was held in Scotland which approved the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Parliament to legislate on most domestic affairs. Following this, the Scottish Office, led by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, decided that a new purpose-built facility would be constructed in Edinburgh, to house the Scottish Parliament.
Initially, three sites in and around Edinburgh were considered as possible locations for the building, including St Andrew&#x27;s House (St Andrews House being the home of the Scottish Office—later the Scottish Government); New Parliament House (better known as the imposing former Old Royal High School, Calton Hill); Victoria Quay at Leith docks (adjacent to the major Scottish Office building there) and Haymarket on the vacant railway goods yard, in the west end of the city. The Holyrood site was not entered into the picture until after the official closure date of the competition between the three sites. The date for announcing the winner overran and on the date of the expected announcement instead it was announced that they were going to &quot;rethink their decision&quot; (implying that indeed a decision had been made) and add the Holyrood Brewery site into the running (which had only just closed). However negotiations with the brewing company Scottish and Newcastle, who owned the land, resulted in the company indicating that they would be able to vacate the site in early 1999. As a consequence, the Secretary of State for Scotland agreed that the Holyrood site merited inclusion on the shortlist of proposed locations. The Scottish Office commissioned feasibility studies of the specified areas in late 1997 and in January 1998, the Holyrood site was selected from the shortlist.

Following on from the site selection, the Scottish Office announced that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as Rafael Viñoly, Michael Wilford and Richard Meier. Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular. The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.

On 6 July 1998, it was declared that the design of Enric Miralles was chosen, with work being awarded to EMBT/RMJM (Scotland) Ltd, a Spanish-Scottish joint venture design company created for the project. Construction, which was undertaken by Bovis Lend Lease, commenced in June 1999, with the demolition of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery and the beginning of foundation work to support the structure of the building. MSPs began to move into the building complex in the summer of 2004, with the official opening by the Queen taking place in October of the same year.

== Archaeology ==
As part of the construction process, archaeologists conducted excavations of the site. These investigations found several phases of use of the site before it became the parliamentary complex:

* Prehistoric - there was some evidence of prehistoric use of the area but not significant amounts.
* The medieval period (1128–1580) - a boundary ditch for Canongate was the first major structure in the area and then later plots were created by Holyrood Abbey to gather rents. In these plots various activities took place such as gardening and leather tanning. As royal patronage of Holyrood Abbey continued to rise the area saw more high-status properties with gardens appear in the area.
* The post-medieval period (1580–1707) - with the construction of Holyrood Palace the area became very prestigious and many of the properties were brought up to form larger townhouses, one of which became Queensberry House. The archaeologists found evidence that Charles Maitland, Lord Hatton may have converted the kitchen of Queensberry House into a workshop to illegally skim money from the Royal mint, Lord Hatton was a Master of the Scottish Mint.
* The early modern period (1707–1825) - with the opening of the New Town, there was an exodus of the wealthy from the area and it went into decline.
* The modern period (1825–present day) - the eastern half of the site became a brewery and Queensberry House was converted to a barracks and later to a House of Refuge.

== Parliamentary complex ==
Miralles sought to design a parliament building that could represent and present a national identity. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity onto the landscape of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach, he talked about slotting the building into the land &quot;in the form of a gathering situation: an amphitheatre, coming out from Arthur&#x27;s Seat&quot;, where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting. An early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate—&quot;not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications.&quot;

The result was a non-hierarchical, organic collection of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery, and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people. As a consequence, the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings, which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur&#x27;s Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land is reinforced by the use of Scottish rock, such as gneiss and granite in the flooring and walls, and the use of oak and sycamore in the construction of the furniture.

The Parliament is actually a campus of several buildings, reflecting different architectural styles, with a total floor area of 31,000 square metres (312,000 sq ft), providing accommodation for MSPs, their researchers and parliamentary staff. The buildings have a variety of features, with the most distinctive external characterisation being the roof of the Tower Buildings, said to be reminiscent of upturned boats on the shoreline. The inspiration had come from Edwin Lutyens&#x27; sheds, made from upturned herring busses (boats), which Miralles saw on a visit to Lindisfarne in Northumberland. It is said that in the first design meeting, Miralles, armed with some twigs and leaves, thrust them onto a table and declared &quot;This is the Scottish Parliament&quot;, reinforcing the unique and abstract nature of the parliamentary campus.
The north-western boundaries of the site, the MSPs&#x27; building, Queensberry House and the Canongate Building reinforce the existing medieval street patterns &quot;expressing intimacy with the city and its citizens&quot;. The south-eastern aspect of the complex is extensively landscaped. Concrete &quot;branches&quot;, covered in turf and wild grass extend from the parliamentary buildings, and provide members of the public with somewhere to sit and relax. Indigenous Scottish wildflowers and plants cover much of the area, blending the Parliament&#x27;s grounds with the nearby Holyrood Park and Salisbury Crags. Oak, Rowan, Lime and Cherry trees have also been planted in the grounds. Adjacent to the landscaped area of the complex, where it meets Horse Wynd, there is an open plan piazza, with bike racks, seating and external lighting shaped like rocks incorporated into concrete paving. Three distinctive water features provide the centrepiece for this area.
References to Scottish culture are also reflected in the building and particularly on some of the building&#x27;s elevations. There are a series of &quot;trigger panels&quot;, constructed out of timber or granite. Not to everyone&#x27;s taste, these have been said to represent anvils, hairdryers, guns, question marks or even the hammer and sickle. Shortly after the official opening of the building, Enric Miralles&#x27; widow, Benedetta Tagliabue, revealed that the design is simply that of a window curtain pulled back. Her late husband however, enjoying the use of ambiguous forms with multiple meanings, had previously said he would love the profile to evoke an icon of Scottish culture, the painting of &quot;The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch&quot;. The architectural critic Charles Jencks finds this a particularly apt metaphor for balanced movement and democratic debate and also notes the irony that Miralles too was skating on ice with his designs for the building. Elsewhere, in the public area beneath the debating chamber, the curved concrete vaults carry various stylised Saltires. Here the architect intends another metaphor; by setting the debating chamber directly above the public area, he seeks to remind MSPs whilst sitting in the chamber that their power derives from the people below them.

The Scottish Parliament Building is open to visitors all year round. On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall of the building and can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms. Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access to the floor of the chamber, the Garden Lobby, Queensberry House and committee rooms in the company of a parliamentary guide. On sitting days, members of the public must obtain tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.

=== Sustainability ===

The Scottish Parliament Building was designed with a number of sustainability features in mind. The decision to build the Parliament on a brownfield site, and its proximity to hubs of public transport are seen as sustainable, environmentally friendly features. All of the electricity purchased for the building comes from renewable sources and solar panels on the Canongate Building are used for heating water in the complex.

A high level of insulation was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat and the use of computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature in different parts of the Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25 metres (80 ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment&#x27;s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).

=== Debating chamber ===

The debating chamber contains a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties sitting in the middle of the semicircle and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. This is in contrast to the &quot;adversarial&quot; layout reminiscent of other Westminster style national legislatures, including the House of Commons, where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another. There are 131 desks and chairs on the floor of the chamber for all the elected members of the Scottish Parliament and members of the Scottish Government. The desks are constructed out of oak and sycamore and are fitted with a lectern, a microphone and in-built speakers as well as the electronic voting equipment used by MSPs. Galleries above the main floor can accommodate a total of 255 members of the public, 18 guests and 34 members of the press.

The most notable feature of the chamber is the roof. The roof is supported by a structure of laminated oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods from the walls. The connecting nodes were fabricated by welders for Scotland&#x27;s oil industry. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30 metres (100 ft) without any supporting columns. In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone in the structure of the debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.

Cut into the western wall of the debating chamber are laminated glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs&#x27; desks to create the impression that the chamber is never unoccupied. Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by &quot;glass fins&quot; which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs&#x27; console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles&#x27; inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [Parliament] is &quot;an arts and crafts building, designed with high-tech flair. You really have to go back to the Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level—in fact, it is more creative&quot;.

On 2 March 2006, a beam in the roof of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, resulting in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business. Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, Arup, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.

=== Garden Lobby ===

The Garden Lobby is at the centre of the parliamentary complex and connects the debating chamber, committee rooms and administrative offices of the Tower Buildings, with Queensberry House and the MSP building. The Garden Lobby is the place where official events as well as television interviews normally take place and it is used as an open social space for MSPs and parliamentary staff.
The main feature of the Garden Lobby are the rooflights, which when viewed from above resemble leaves or the early Christian &quot;vesica&quot; shape, and allow natural light into the building. The rooflights are made from stainless steel and the glasswork is covered by a lattice of solid oak struts. The route through the Garden Lobby up the main staircase to the debating chamber has been described as &quot;one of the great processional routes in contemporary architecture.&quot;

=== MSP building ===
The MSP building is connected to the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid&#x27;s Close. The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture. The building is between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite. MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building. Each office is divided into two parts: one for the MSP, with a floor space of 15 square metres (160 sq ft), and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12 square metres (130 sq ft). The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish stepped gable. In each office, these bay windows have a seat and shelving and are intended as &quot;contemplation spaces&quot;. Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun. Ahead of the opening of the Parliament, some MSPs who questioned whether the design would allow sufficient natural light into their offices. To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles. At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.

=== Other buildings ===
Four tower buildings fan out along the front, or eastern edge, of the parliamentary complex and are notable for the curvature of their roofs. The Tower Buildings are home to the public entrance of the Scottish Parliament and to the Main Hall, which is located on the eastern side of the parliamentary complex, beneath the debating chamber. A stone vaulted ceiling is the principal feature of the Main Hall, which has cross like representations carved into it, reminiscent of the Saltire, the national flag of Scotland. The Main Hall contains permanent exhibitions on the role of the Scottish Parliament, as well as public seating, a visitor information desk, a shop, lockers and a creche. Like much of the parliamentary complex, the materials used to construct the Main Hall and its vaulted ceiling include Kemnay Granite from Aberdeenshire in north east Scotland and Caithness stone, which is used in much of the flooring in the buildings. Connected to the Tower Buildings in the eastern portion of the complex are the Media and Canongate Buildings, which house the IT and procurement departments of the Parliament, as well as media offices and the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). The centrepiece of the Canongate Building is a two-storey cantilever structure, with the building connected at one end by reinforced concrete and 18 metres (60 ft) of the building suspended above ground and protruding outwards unsupported by any columns.

Originally dating from 1667, Queensberry House is an example of a seventeenth century Edinburgh townhouse and contrasts with the modern architecture of the rest of the parliamentary complex. From c.1800, Queensberry House has been used as a hospital, army barracks, a refuge and a geriatric hospital. In 1996, the geriatric hospital closed and the building was incorporated into the Scottish and Newcastle brewery, who owned the surrounding site. The building has been extensively refurbished, and returned to its original height of three storeys to provide facilities for the Presiding Officer, Deputy Presiding Officers, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament and various parliamentary support staff. Internally and externally the building has been strengthened with reinforced steel and concrete. The original timber flooring has been replaced throughout with a mixture of carpet, vinyl, oak and Caithness stone. Queensberry House also contains the Donald Dewar Room, dedicated to the founding First Minister of Scotland, who died in October 2000. The room hosts the personal collection of books and other memorabilia donated to the Parliament by the family of Donald Dewar after his death.

=== Artwork and features ===

The Scottish Parliament holds a wide variety of artwork and sculpture ranging from specially commissioned pieces to official gifts from overseas parliamentary delegations. The intention of including artwork and sculptures in the building reinforces the desire of Miralles that the project should reflect the nature of Scotland, particularly its land and people. In order to facilitate the incorporation of art into the building, a consultative steering group was established by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) under the chairmanship of Jamie Stone MSP with the remit of deciding which artworks should be chosen. Some pieces of artwork are on public display in the building.

As well as artwork and sculptures, quotations, furniture and photography have been commissioned as part of the art strategy. A range of quotations have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex. Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks, such as Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone and Easdale slate. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations. Etched along the lower stretch of the wall is a pictorial representation of the Old Town of Edinburgh, based around a sketch by Enric Miralles, showing the view of the Old Town from his bedroom window in the Balmoral Hotel.
The Main Hall of the Parliament contains a number of distinctive features and sculptures, including the gold-plated &quot;Honours of Scotland&quot; sculpture. Presented by the Queen upon the opening of the Parliament building, the sculpture is modelled on the actual Honours of Scotland, the crown, sceptre and the sword of the state, and combines these three separate elements into one composition. During meetings of the original Parliament of Scotland, the actual Honours were always present, but since 1819 they have been permanently housed in Edinburgh Castle. The 11 m (36 ft) long Visitor Information Desk also stands in the Main Hall. Commissioned by the art strategy group, the desk combines a unique design constructed from oak and sycamore, and functions as a workstation for six members of parliamentary staff. At a cost of £88,000, the desk has been criticised by some over its price and functionality.

Another feature gifted to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen, following its inauguration in July 1999, is the parliamentary mace. The mace is housed in a glass case in the debating chamber, and has a formal, ceremonial role during meetings of the Parliament. The mace sits in front of the Presiding Officers&#x27; desk; it is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers, and inscribed with the words &quot;Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Compassion&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Integrity&quot;. The words &quot;There shall be a Scottish Parliament&quot; (which are the first words of the Scotland Act 1998), are inscribed around the head of the mace. At the beginning of each session in the chamber, the case is removed to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

== Critical response ==

Public reaction to the design of the building has been mixed. In the first six months of the building being open to the public, 250,000 people visited it, which Presiding Officer George Reid has said showed the public were &quot;voting with their feet&quot;. Critics of the building, such as Margo MacDonald, pointed out that the high number of visitors does not prove that all of them like the building. As well as cost, criticisms of the stem primarily from the modernist and abstract architecture, the quality of the construction work and the location.

The mixed public reaction contrasts sharply with the response from architectural critics. Its rampant complexity, iconography and layering of meaning and metaphor are widely regarded as producing a building which is &quot;quite a meal&quot;. This prompted Catherine Slessor, writing in the &quot;Architectural Review&quot;, to describe it as &quot;A Celtic-Spanish cocktail to blow both minds and budgets, it doesn&#x27;t play safe, energetically mining a new seam of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century.&quot; Jencks attempted to dampen criticism of the cost overruns by questioning how &#x27;value for money&#x27; might be judged. For him, the building is not just a functional or economic enterprise, it is an exploration of national identity, and in comparing it to other comparable assemblies, not least the Palace of Westminster, he argues the cost is comparable. The conception of the building has been singled out for praise, particularly in the way it re-establishes Scotland&#x27;s traditional focus towards mainland Europe and its values by means of the layout of the non-adversarial debating chamber, and the creation of the public spaces in front of the building, &quot;where people can meet and express themselves as a force&quot;. In an era of the Bilbao effect and the iconic building, Jencks is impressed that rather than being a monumental building, as is usual for capital landmarks, the building creates a complex union of nature and culture that nestles itself into the landscape.

The building has also won a number of awards, including an award at the VIII Biennial of Spanish Architecture, the RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture, and the 2005 Stirling Prize, the UK&#x27;s most prestigious architecture award. The inclusion of the Scottish Parliament Building on the shortlist for the Stirling Prize in 2004, led the judges to describe the building as &quot;a statement of sparkling excellence&quot;. In October 2005 the building was identified as Scotland&#x27;s fourth greatest modern building by readers of &quot;Prospect&quot;. In 2004, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; also granted the building their Sir Hugh Casson Award for &quot;worst new building of the year&quot;.

== Problems ==
=== Timeline of cost increases ===
The construction of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs and the use of public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997. By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten times greater.

=== Controversy ===
Notwithstanding the level of controversy surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial in a number of other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis Lend Lease as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.

Control of the building project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament&#x27;s then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, at a time of increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.

In August 1999, the architect informed the project group that the Parliament would need to be further increased in size by . A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by the architect John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.

The project was also complicated by the deaths of Miralles in July 2000, of Dewar the following October and the existence of a multi-headed client consisting of the SPCB, the Presiding Officer and an architectural advisor. The client took over the running of the project from the Scottish Executive (formerly the Scottish Office) while it was already under construction. Subsequently, the events of 9/11 led to further design changes, especially with regard to security, which again resulted in rising costs. However, it was later rejected that the re-designs required to incorporate greater security into the building structure were the &quot;single biggest&quot; factor affecting the increased costs of the project.

By March 2004 the cost had reached the sum of £430m (compared to an original budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 for each of the 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.

== Fraser Inquiry ==

In May 2003 the First Minister, Jack McConnell, announced a major public inquiry into the handling of the building project. The inquiry (known as the Holyrood Inquiry, or the Fraser Inquiry) was headed by Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and held at the Scottish Land Court in Edinburgh. The inquiry took evidence from architects, civil servants, politicians and the building companies. Evidence was taken over the course of 49 hearings and the final report ran to 300 pages.

=== Criticisms ===
Presenting his report in September 2004, Lord Fraser told how he was &quot;astonished&quot; that year after year the ministers who were in charge were kept so much in the dark over the increases in cost estimates. He also stated that a Parliament building of sufficient scale could never have been built for less than £50m, and was &quot;amazed&quot; that the belief that it could be was perpetuated for so long. He believed that from at least April 2000, when MSPs commissioned the Spencely Report to decide whether the building should continue, it should have been realised that the building was bound to cost in excess of £200m. Furthermore, £150m of the final cost was wasted as a result of design delays, over-optimistic programming and uncertain authority.

Despite having only an outline design, the designers RMJM/EMBT (Scotland) Ltd stated without foundation that the building could be completed within a £50m budget. Nevertheless, these estimates were believed by officials. The two architectural practices in the RMJM and EMBT joint venture operated dysfunctionally and failed to communicate effectively with each other and the project manager. The death of Miralles also gave rise to a substantial period of disharmony. The Brief emphasised the importance of design and quality over cost, and was not updated despite considerable evolution of the design. Ministers were not informed of grave concerns within the Scottish Office over the cost of the project and officials failed to take the advice of the cost consultants.

The Scottish Office decided to procure the construction work under a &quot;construction management contract&quot;, rather than under a Private Finance Initiative, in order to speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and – in a decision that Fraser stated &quot;beggars belief&quot; – without asking Ministers to approve it. This was one of the two most flawed decisions which the report singled out, the other was the insistence on a rigid programme. Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a complex building were required. In attempting to achieve early completion, the management contractor produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit. The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual procurement route.

The inquiry was widely seen as clearing Donald Dewar for the initial mishandling of the project. This came after speculation suggesting that Dewar was aware that the initial costs of a new Parliament Building, circulated to the public, were too low. However, in his report, Lord Fraser stated &quot;there was no evidence whatsoever, that he [Dewar] deliberately or knowingly misled MSPs. He relied on cost figures given to him by senior civil servants.&quot; The inquiry also resisted the temptation to &quot;lay all of the blame at the door of a deceased wayward architectural genius [Miralles]...costs rose because the client wanted increases and changes or at least approved of them in one manifestation or other.&quot;

=== Reaction and recommendations ===
In his report, Lord Fraser set out a number of recommendations stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish-based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices needs to be made.

Lord Fraser advocated that when &quot;construction management&quot; contracts were used, civil servants or local government officials should evaluate the risks of such a contract and set out the advantages and disadvantages of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being &quot;filtered&quot; by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous as standards applied in the private sector.

Following publication of the report, Jack McConnell stated that the Fraser recommendations would be fully implemented, and that fundamental reform of the civil service was already under way, with trained professionals being recruited to handle such projects. The First Minister emphasised that he was keen to see an increase in the specialist skills of civil servants, in order for them to be able to administer projects of such magnitude in the future. John Elvidge, the most senior civil servant in Scotland, admitted that best practice had not been followed and apologised for the way the project had been handled. He did not rule out the possibility of taking disciplinary action against civil service staff, although subsequent Scottish Government investigations resulted in no action being taken against individual public officials involved with the project.
== Demonstrations ==
In 2015, the pro-independence group People&#x27;s Voice established a demonstration camp on the grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence. The camp was objected to as it risked infringing on the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate and prevented others from using the grounds. Sheriff officers issued the campers with a notice ordering them to leave, but the campers refused to do so.
