<text>Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish musician, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the primary songwriter, keyboardist, and founding member of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has stated that his songwriting is influenced by harmonic film music.

Before founding Nightwish, he played in the band Darkwoods My Betrothed. He later recorded an album with them as a full member in 2020. He also collaborated with the gothic metal band For My Pain... and the band of Timo Rautiainen.

Holopainen has written several songs that have been included in movie soundtracks, including a collaboration with Nightwish bass player and male vocalist Marko Hietala on &quot;While Your Lips Are Still Red&quot;, for the Finnish film &quot;Lieksa!&quot; in 2007. He also co-wrote the music for Nightwish&#x27;s own film, &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;, released in November 2012.

Holopainen released his first solo album &quot;Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge&quot; in 2014.

== Early and personal life ==
Tuomas Holopainen was born in Kitee on Christmas Day 1976. His parents were entrepreneur Pentti Holopainen (1940–2021), and Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, a former music and English teacher in a small elementary school. He has an older sister named Susanna who works as a surgeon-urologist, and an older brother named Petri who is an autopsy assistant. He and singer Elina Siirala are second cousins. His musicality and skill in text expression showed early in school. His mother signed him up for piano class in school when he was seven years old, and he later studied clarinet, tenor saxophone, piano and music theory for twelve years at a music college. However, he has not played the clarinet nor the saxophone since the mid-nineties. Originally aspiring to be a biologist, Holopainen had no interest in metal until his school foreign exchange partner took him to see Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses in America, and he became hooked.

Holopainen is a fan of Disney, Tolkien and Dragonlance. In 2006 Holopainen said that he is &quot;not religious, but an open-minded, thinking individual&quot;. He does not consider &quot;religion to be bad, but human interpretation of it.&quot;

Holopainen married Finnish pop singer Johanna Kurkela on 28 October 2015.

He is a vegetarian.

A new insect species, &quot;Sciophilia holopaineni&quot;, discovered by a Finnish biologist named Jukka Salmela of Metsähallitus Parks &amp; Wildlife, has been named after Tuomas Holopainen, because of Holopainen&#x27;s love for nature.

== Musical career ==
=== First bands, formation of Nightwish and first releases ===
Holopainen joined his first bands in 1991. He played in several bands, including recording keyboards for three albums with black metal band Darkwoods My Betrothed and playing with Dismal Silence, Nattvindens Gråt and Sethian. He was then conscripted for the Finnish Army, where he managed to earn a position as the clarinet player of the military band, which spared him from gun-related activities.

In July 1996, a 19-year-old Holopainen began thinking of starting a band of his own, for which he would write the music and play keyboards. This was the birth of Nightwish, around a camp fire. He asked Emppu Vuorinen and classmate Tarja Turunen to join what was then an acoustic project, with music he wrote during his time in the army. After hearing Tarja&#x27;s strong voice, and because of the metal influences of Vuorinen and drummer Jukka Nevalainen, Tuomas decided to turn Nightwish into a metal act. Before becoming a full-time musician, Holopainen worked for two years as a high school stand-in teacher in his hometown.

Nightwish&#x27;s first non-demo release, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;, came in 1997, followed by &quot;Oceanborn&quot; in 1998. In 1999, Holopainen and members of other Finnish metal acts like Embraze, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Charon and Reflexion started the gothic metal supergroup For My Pain.... However, as all the members were busy with their own bands, the project was postponed for the future.

Nightwish&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Wishmaster&quot;, was released in 2000. The third release sold even better than the previous album. In 2001, again the idea of For My Pain... was brought up, and the members started planning a debut.

=== World fame ===

In Nightwish&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Century Child&quot;, released in 2002, Holopainen began collaborating with symphonic orchestras from Finland and the United Kingdom, which was a change in the band&#x27;s music and Holopainen&#x27;s style of composition, and also allowed for more freedom with additional instruments. The use of orchestral elements has been present in the studio album releases from Nightwish since.

In 2003, For My Pain... released its debut album, entitled &quot;Fallen&quot;. In 2004, For My Pain... released &quot;Killing Romance&quot;, a Finnish single with three previously unreleased tracks; &quot;Killing Romance&quot;, &quot;Joutsenlaulu&quot; and &quot;Too Sad to Live&quot;.

Nightwish&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Once&quot; was released in 2004, and became their US break-through. Singles &quot;Nemo&quot; and &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot; were played on MTV. Nightwish started their most extensive tour to date, the Once World Tour, visiting several countries, like Japan, for the first time. After the last concert (a filmed show in Hartwall Areena, Finland which was featured on the &quot;End of an Era&quot; DVD in 2006), in October 2005, Nightwish gave vocalist Tarja Turunen a letter explaining her dismissal from the band.

=== Current career ===
In 2006, Holopainen went through a dark period filled with anxiety and depression, made worse by rumours about himself and Nightwish in the tabloids every day. These events also inspired him in the writing of &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, Nightwish&#x27;s sixth album.

After heavy metal singer Timo Rautiainen&#x27;s break up of Trio Niskalaukaus, he published his first solo album titled &quot;Sarvivuori&quot; with a crew gathered from different bands, including Holopainen on keyboards. Holopainen also wrote one song on the album. Early the next year, For My Pain... announced that they would soon start recording the successor to &quot;Fallen&quot;, but it was reported in the same autumn that the album once again was postponed.

In April 2007 Holopainen collaborated with fellow Nightwish member Marko Hietala to write a theme song for the Finnish film &quot;Lieksa!&quot;. The song, &quot;While Your Lips Are Still Red&quot;, was the first song he had written specifically for a film, though several Nightwish songs (&quot;Nemo&quot;, &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot;, &quot;Amaranth&quot;) have been included in film soundtracks. Holopainen has said that writing film scores is something he would like to do in the future. On &quot;While Your Lips Are Still Red&quot;, in addition to Holopainen on piano, Marko Hietala performs vocals and acoustic bass guitar, and Jukka Nevalainen plays drums.

In 2007, Holopainen played keyboards with Finnish punk band Kylähullut on their EP &quot;Lisää persettä rättipäille&quot;. He would return to play keyboards on their following album &quot;Peräaukko sivistyksessä.&quot; Holopainen can be heard singing with the chorus on both of these releases.

The new vocalist for Nightwish was revealed in May 2007; Swede Anette Olzon, who appears on &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, released in late August of the same year. On 8 May 2008, it was announced that Holopainen would be the producer of Finnish pop/rock band Indica&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Valoissa&quot;, which was released in 2008. Holopainen was credited for helping to create the Finnish trance artist Orkidea&#x27;s third album, Metaverse in 2008, for the collaboration in Orkidea&#x27;s version of Nightwish&#x27;s song &quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&quot;.

Nightwish&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;, was released on 30 November 2011 in Finland and in North America on 10 January 2012. Nightwish released their eighth and ninth studio albums, &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot; on 25 March 2015 and 10 April 2020 respectively, and later released their tenth studio album, &quot;Yesterwynde&quot; on 20 September 2024.

== Solo projects ==
Holopainen originally confirmed that he was producing a solo project in 2012. Holopainen stated on his website, The Escapist, that he planned to devote his time completely to songwriting for the project in Feb–April 2013 after the Nightwish Imaginaerum tour. In 2014 he released &quot;Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge&quot; based on the comic book series &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; by Don Rosa. The record featured Nightwish musician Troy Donockley as well as the London session musicians used previously in recent Nightwish releases.

In a November 2015 interview, he revealed plans to release a book with short fantasy and horror stories influenced by Neil Gaiman and Stephen King.

Holopainen also composed the song &quot;Lohtu&quot; for year 2015 concert &quot;Live Aid ULS2017&quot;.

== Music ==

=== Composing ===

Holopainen is a source of inspiration for other bands, especially within symphonic, gothic and power metal. Simone Simons, lead singer of Epica, stated that she began singing due to Nightwish. Ex-singer of Visions of Atlantis, Nicole Bogner, also acknowledged that Nightwish had greatly inspired the band, especially for their first album.

Sander Gommans of After Forever said that Nightwish &quot;will certainly influence us in creating new songs&quot;. Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica&#x27;s lead singer Tony Kakko, who has worked with Nightwish both in making the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; duet with Tarja Turunen and as a crowd warmer, explained several times how much of an influence Nightwish is for him.

<text>Erno Matti Juhani &quot;Emppu&quot; Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish, Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria.

==Biography==
Vuorinen started playing guitar as a hobby at the age of ten. Vuorinen knew Jukka Nevalainen from elementary school and met Tuomas Holopainen at a gig by Nattvindens Gråt. As Holopainen started Nightwish he asked Vuorinen to join the new band. The new band, called Nightwish, started as an acoustic music project and they asked Tarja Turunen to join initially for three songs.

Vuorinen has a black belt in judo and has won a bronze-medal from Nordic championship of the youth and two gold-medals from Finnish championship of the youth.

Vuorinen has a recording studio at Kerava with Tero Kinnunen. Vuorinen and Marko Hietala received cultural award from Kerava for their contributions.

==Background==
Vuorinen and Nevalainen played together in bands Ambrosia and Nidhro&#x27;t before Nightwish.

Vuorinen and Holopainen founded Nightwish in 1996 with Tarja Turunen.
Vuorinen also formed Brother Firetribe as a side project in 2002 after moving to Kerava. Vuorinen has produced and recorded Brother Firetribe albums with band member Tomppa Nikulainen. In 2004 Vuorinen left Altaria. 

In Nightwish, Vuorinen is primarily a rhythm player, often supporting the keyboard or orchestral parts of Nightwish songs. However, he plays lead melodies and solos as well. Vuorinen&#x27;s solo techniques usually include alternate picking, tapping, sliding, legato, and minor to extreme whammy bar use; he also employs sweep picking, although very rarely. His solos are more melodic than those of most metal bands, but he sometimes shreds (notably in &quot;Nightquest,&quot; &quot;The Pharaoh Sails to Orion,&quot; &quot;Romanticide,&quot; and &quot;Gethsemane&quot; by Nightwish, and also in &quot;Traitor&quot; by Tarot, for which he provided a solo). Nightwish&#x27;s first three albums feature a larger amount of lead guitar work from Vuorinen than their later albums.

Vuorinen is also a creative force in Nightwish, having co-written songs with Tuomas Holopainen from &quot;Oceanborn&quot; until &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;. The song &quot;Whoever Brings The Night&quot; on &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; is written by Vuorinen alone.

Vuorinen has said that when he was younger there was more of a need to show skills which has since diminished and since then he plays more as the song requires, also leaving more of the songwriting responsibilities to Holopainen. Vuorinen does not play excessive notes and keeps to the atmosphere of the songs.

Vuorinen recorded guitar parts for Almah, a Brazilian metal band, order to help his friend and vocalist Edu Falaschi (former singer of Angra). Vuorinen did not stay in the band because of his obligations to Nightwish. He was also involved with Brother Firetribe, an AOR band, and played on four albums released worldwide: &quot;False Metal&quot; (re-released as &quot;Break Out&quot;), &quot;Heart Full of Fire&quot;, &quot;Diamond in the Firepit&quot; and &quot;Sunbound&quot;.

In 2020 Vuorinen left Brother Firetribe due to lack of time.

<text>Alfred Christopher Picard (24 May 1824 – 17 September 1855) was a 19th-century New Zealand politician.

Picard was born in London in 1824. He arrived in New Zealand in 1848 with the &quot;Ajax&quot; and first settled in Nelson. By 1853, he was living in Riwaka near Motueka, with his profession listed as solicitor. He married Mary Ann Askew on 10 July 1850 and they had two sons; William Alfred and John Thomas.


On 18 August 1853, Picard and Samuel Stephens contested the Motueka and Massacre Bay electorate for a seat in the 1st New Zealand Parliament, which Picard won by 44 votes to 32. On the following day, Picard was one of three candidates for the two seats for the Motueka District in the Nelson Provincial Council. At 12 noon, Picard withdrew from the election and the other two candidates, Samuel Stephens and Charles Parker, were thus elected.

On 31 July 1855, an additional member was to be elected for the Nelson Provincial Council. Picard was the only candidate and was declared returned unopposed. When the House of Representatives started its third session in early August 1855, James Mackay read a letter from Picard who was asking for a month&#x27;s leave, but upon protest from Picard&#x27;s adversary, William Travers, leave was denied. The third parliamentary session was short and parliament, at the time based in Auckland, was dissolved on 15 September 1855 without Picard having attended this session.

On 17 September 1855, Picard died in Motueka from heart failure. He had never taken his seat at the Provincial Council, which would next meet in January 1856. Picard was described as a &quot;man of considerable culture and education and a brilliant speaker.&quot;

<text>Marko Tapani &quot;Marco&quot; Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bassist and songwriter. Internationally, he is best known as the former bassist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot.

He is also a member of the supergroup Northern Kings, and portrayed one of the main characters in Ayreon&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;.

==Biography==
Marko Hietala was born in Kuopio, and is the youngest child of the Hietala family. Hietala lived in Tervo until the age of 15, after which he moved to Kuopio to study classical guitar, vocals and musical theory in high school. In 1984, he and his brother Zachary formed the heavy metal band Tarot under the name &quot;Purgatory&quot;. In 1986, Tarot received a deal for their first album and went on tour. Before becoming a full-time musician, he worked as a live and studio sound engineer.

While on tour with Tarot in 1998, Marko had met the members of the band Nightwish in Siilinjärvi as they were an opening act for his band. Marko recalled having watched their performance: &quot;I watched their show and thought their music was actually quite good at times. They had all this force and drama, so maybe some day they would successfully combine the two. But goddamn, they looked absolutely horrible on stage. Shorthaired guys just standing there – Tarja was a pretty girl but just as petrified, shrieking in the middle of the stage in her leather pants. Honestly, I assumed them to be just a momentary fad and thought they will fade away after six months or so. Luckily, of course, I was so wrong.&quot;

=== Nightwish: 2001–2021 ===

Hietala joined Nightwish in 2001 when Tuomas Holopainen and the band&#x27;s manager called him and said that there would be a place in the band for a vocalist and a bass player. &quot;Century Child&quot; was his first Nightwish album, following the departure of previous bassist Sami Vänskä. He was a prominent guest musician in Delain, a project involving many members of the gothic and symphonic metal community. He also participated in the recording of &quot;Invitation&quot;, by Altaria, providing backing vocals. Hietala has also been part of the bands Sinergy and Northern Kings.

Upon his arrival to Nightwish, several songs were written to contain duets with then Nightwish vocalist Tarja Turunen, allowing songwriter and band leader Tuomas Holopainen to take advantage of Hietala&#x27;s distinctive raucous voice to add a new dimension to the band. A famous example is Nightwish&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, from the album &quot;Century Child&quot;.

During Nightwish&#x27;s shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, W.A.S.P.&#x27;s &quot;Wild Child&quot;, Dio&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;, Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;High Hopes&quot;. Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen&#x27;s departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song &quot;The Islander&quot;, on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside Holopainen for co-writing the song &quot;The Crow, the Owl and the Dove&quot; from Nightwish&#x27;s 2011 album, &quot;Imaginaerum&quot;.
In Delain, Hietala played bass for the album &quot;Lucidity&quot; and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song &quot;The Gathering&quot;. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on Delain&#x27;s second album &quot;April Rain&quot; and two songs from Delain&#x27;s fourth album &quot;The Human Contradiction&quot;.

In March 2009, Hietala joined the band Sapattivuosi. They cover Black Sabbath songs in Finnish. In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.

On 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a choir career. This was identified as an April Fool&#x27;s joke, but was also a reference to his participation in &quot;Kuorosota&quot; (the localized Finnish version of &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot;) in 2010. Hietala was the master of the Kuopio choir in the program&#x27;s second season. He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the Joensuu choir, headed by pop rock singer Ilkka Alanko. Tarot&#x27;s single &quot;I Walk Forever&quot;, from the &quot;Gravity of Light&quot; album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, Tommi Salmela and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.

In June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing Black Sabbath&#x27;s Neon Knights with Ripper Owens, Andreas Kisser, James LoMenzo and Paul Bostaph at two of their shows in Finland.

On 14 August 2013, Hietala was the first singer to be confirmed by Arjen Lucassen to guest on Ayreon&#x27;s new album &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;. In 2017 he joined Ayreon on stage for three shows at 013 Poppodium in Tilburg, the recording of these shows was later released as Ayreon&#x27;s live album Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live.

Hietala released his first solo album &quot;Mustan sydämen rovio&quot; in May 2019. He released the album under his birthname Marko Hietala and will be using the name also in his other projects in the future. Hietala has described his solo material as &quot;hard prog&quot;. An English version of the album, titled &quot;Pyre of the Black Heart&quot; (Nuclear Blast), followed in January 2020. Joining him on the albums are drummer Anssi Nykänen, keyboardist Vili Ollila and guitarist Tuomas Wäinölä with whom he also toured in Finland in the summer and autumn of 2019. The band embarked on a European tour in February 2020.

In 2020, he participated in and won the Finnish edition of Masked Singer.

=== 2021–present ===

In December 2020, Hietala told Nightwish he had decided to leave to focus on other projects. He had been suffering from several mental disorders, including depression, for a decade. Despite medication, he had kept on getting worse. After the recording of &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot; and in part due to the respite brought by COVID-19 pandemic, Hietala finally reached the conclusion that leaving the band would prevent his illnesses from worsening. On 12 January 2021, Hietala made his departure public and announced his withdrawal from the public eye.
Ten days later, Swedish symphonic metal band Therion released a music video for the song &quot;Tuonela&quot; that featured Hietala.

On 18 June 2022, Northern Kings made a comeback that ended their 12-year hiatus and Hietala&#x27;s 17-month break from the public. The band played at the &#x27;Tuhdimmat Tahdit festival&#x27; in Nokia, Finland. Hietala later in an interview, stated that he has not made contact with the members of Nightwish since his departure from the band in January 2021, and expressed uncertainty that he will be returning to Nightwish. In an interview in October 2023, Hietala expressed doubt that he would ever return to Nightwish.

Hietala performed with his solo band at &quot;Z7 Summer Nights&quot; Open Air in Pratteln, Switzerland on 8 July 2023, later joining former Nightwish bandmate Tarja Turunen at her solo show later in the evening to sing &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with her. It was the first time they had sung the song together, after Tarja was fired from Nightwish in 2005. They also performed the song at Olavinlinna in Finland. They toured together in 2024 in both Latin America and Europe on Tarja&#x27;s &quot;Living The Dream – The Hits Tour&quot;. While both Hietala and Turunen released a collaborative single titled &quot;Left on Mars&quot; on 13 March 2024, Hietala stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of him and Turunen starting a new band together. Hietala released the single, &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Wife&quot;, on 4 September 2024. On 26 November 2024, the third single, &quot;Impatient Zero&quot; was released, simultaneously with the announcement of Hietala&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Roses from the Deep&quot; which was released on 7 February 2025.

Hietala participated in Season 15 of the Finnish TV show &quot;Vain elämää&quot; in 2024.

==Influences==

Hietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is Geezer Butler and Bob Daisley, while Ronnie James Dio and Rob Halford are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from &quot;really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff&quot;, saying that he &quot;tend[s] to soak up almost everything&quot; which &quot;somehow ends up being used&quot; when he writes his own music.

== Personal life ==
Hietala has two children with his ex-wife Manki, twin boys Antto and Miro (born in 2001). They lived in Kuopio, Finland. When he is not touring, he enjoys reading books, playing video games, and watching movies. He especially likes fantasy, horror and science fiction books. In 2016, a Finnish newspaper reported that Hietala had filed for divorce. In August 2018, he married Camila (Cavalcanti) Hietala. He and his wife have a daughter and live in Spain.

Born Marko, Hietala has been regularly credited throughout his career as Marco. He said he adopted the version with &quot;c&quot; when he was young and trying to sound &quot;cool&quot;, but that now it doesn&#x27;t matter to him anymore. Starting with &quot;Mustan Sydämen Rovio&quot;, he intends to be credited as Marko in all his future projects. He also referred to the &quot;Marco&quot; spelling as &quot;the last lie I had constructed about myself&quot;.

<text>Jukka Antero &quot;Julius&quot; Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, in Kitee, Finland) is the former drummer of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish.

== Personal life ==
He spent his early years in the city of Kitee. His music teacher at school told him that a new educational program for music was opening, and he thought Nevalainen would fit in well as a drummer. He lacked a suitable place to practice so he made do at his home. His first band was &quot;The Highway&quot; but he joined his first real band at the age of 15–16. The band had a rehearsal place, but was restricted to practice only a couple of days a week. After he left that band, he joined up with Emppu Vuorinen and they got a permanent practice place.
Nevalainen and Vuorinen played together in bands Ambrosia and Nidhro&#x27;t before Nightwish.

Nevalainen lives with his wife Satu, daughter Luna (born in 2003) and son Niki (born on 19 December 2005) in Joensuu, Finland. His second daughter, Lara, was born on 22 June 2010. He is a vegetarian.

==Career==

After the early years of the band, Nevalainen got a new professional drum kit. He used that kit from the album &quot;Wishmaster&quot; to the end of the &quot;Once&quot; world tour in 2005. He was endorsed by Tama drums, Paiste cymbals and Pro-Mark sticks. He was in a side-project, Sethian, which is now completely dormant because of band members being busy with other bands.

On 6 August 2014, it was announced that Nevalainen would not be able to take part of Nightwish&#x27;s eighth album and its subsequent tour due to insomnia, thus making the album &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot; the first Nightwish recording without his participation. Nevalainen still handled the day-to-day affairs of the band, though. Kai Hahto (Wintersun) took his place in the album and on the subsequent tour. He returned to perform one song during their unofficial 20th-anniversary concert in August 2016 at Himos Park in Jämsä, Finland.

In July 2019, Nevalainen released a statement that he was not going to return to Nightwish and that he would continue working with the band behind the scenes, and that Hahto would become the band&#x27;s new permanent drummer.

<text>Patricia Lynn Yearwood (born September 19, 1964) is an American country singer. She rose to fame with her 1991 debut single &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with the Boy&quot;, which became a number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart. Its corresponding self-titled debut album would sell over two million copies. Yearwood continued with a series of major country hits during the early to mid-1990s, including &quot;Walkaway Joe&quot; (1992), &quot;The Song Remembers When&quot; (1993), &quot;XXX&#x27;s and OOO&#x27;s (An American Girl)&quot; (1994), and &quot;Believe Me Baby (I Lied)&quot; (1996).

Yearwood&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;How Do I Live&quot; reached number two on the U.S. country singles chart and was internationally successful. It appeared on her first compilation &quot;(Songbook) A Collection of Hits&quot; (1997). The album certified quadruple-platinum in the United States and featured the hits &quot;In Another&#x27;s Eyes&quot; and &quot;Perfect Love&quot;. Yearwood had a string of commercial successes over the next several years including the hit singles &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; and &quot;I Would&#x27;ve Loved You Anyway&quot;. She released her tenth studio record &quot;Jasper County&quot; in 2005, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart and the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It would become her fastest-selling album in the United States. Yearwood signed with Big Machine Records in 2007 and released the critically acclaimed &quot;Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love&quot; the same year.

Yearwood spent several years on hiatus from her own musical career to focus on other projects. She published three successful cookbooks, which appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2012, she began a culinary television series on the Food Network called &quot;Trisha&#x27;s Southern Kitchen&quot;, which later won a Daytime Emmy Award. Yearwood has sold over 15 million records worldwide. Her work has earned her several awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, three awards from the Academy of Country Music, and three awards from the Country Music Association. Yearwood has also been a cast member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1999. Since 2005 she has been married to country singer Garth Brooks, with whom she has collaborated on a number of occasions.

==Early life==
Yearwood was born in Monticello, Georgia, the daughter of schoolteacher Gwendolyn Yearwood and local banker Jack Howard Yearwood. Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s ancestors came to North America from England during the colonial era. From an early age, she was passionate about music and participated in various music events held by her school and community. This included talent shows, church events, and musicals. After graduating high school from Piedmont Academy in Monticello, class of 1982, Yearwood studied for two years at Young Harris College, receiving an associate degree in business. She then attended the University of Georgia for one semester before dropping out. Yearwood then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1985, enrolling in Belmont College and pursued a music business degree.

Yearwood gained an internship with MTM Records and was eventually hired as a full-time employee. With the help of the record label&#x27;s resources, she recorded a series of demo tapes and also sang background vocals for new artists. One of the artists she recorded with was Garth Brooks. Developing a friendship, Brooks promised to help Yearwood sign a recording contract if his career succeeded. Brooks brought her to his producer, Allen Reynolds, who then brought her to the attention of producer Garth Fundis. Fundis and Yearwood began collaborating and eventually crafted a demo recording tape. In 1990, she sang background vocals on Brooks&#x27; second album, &quot;No Fences&quot;, and performed live at a label showcase. MCA Records producer Tony Brown heard her performance and was impressed. Brown helped her sign a recording contract with the label. After signing with the label, she served as the opening act on Brooks&#x27; 1991 nationwide tour.

==Music career==
===1991: Breakthrough===
Yearwood&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1991. Its lead single &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with the Boy&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, bringing her major success. Three other singles from the album reached the top ten on the country chart — &quot;Like We Never Had a Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;The Woman Before Me&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like About You&quot;. Her debut album eventually sold one million copies and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of two million copies. Yearwood also became the first female country artist to sell a million copies of her debut album. AllMusic reviewed the album and called the effort &quot;a very classy debut that stands the test of time,&quot; giving it four and a half out of five stars. Additionally, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, said that Yearwood&#x27;s voice &quot;demonstrates technical and emotional authority at every turn.&quot; Yearwood&#x27;s success garnered her a series of major music awards. In 1991, she was named Top New Female Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music and was voted Favorite New Country Artist by the American Music Awards in 1992.

With success, Yearwood began engaging in more opportunities. Parting ways with her previous management firm, she began working under the supervision of Ken Kragen, who oversaw Kenny Rogers and Travis Tritt. She also became the spokesperson for the WildHeart fragrance by Revlon. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, Yearwood explained that while filming the fragrance&#x27;s commercial, she was asked to embrace with a male model. She declined to do so and would not continue production until her manager arrived to support her decision. The commercial was eventually filmed and shown on major television networks.

===1992–1996: Career diversification===
In 1992, Yearwood released her second studio album, &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot;. With her second album, Yearwood chose songs that came from emotional conflicts following the divorce from first husband, Chris Latham. The album was a departure from her previous material, containing ballads and collaborations with Don Henley, Emmylou Harris, and Raul Malo. Music critics praised the album. Allmusic called the album &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;one of the best heartbreak records country music delivered in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s.&quot; About.com gave it five stars and called &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot; &quot;possibly Trisha&#x27;s best album ever.&quot; The album&#x27;s first two singles reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in 1992 — &quot;Wrong Side of Memphis&quot; and &quot;Walkaway Joe&quot;, the latter featuring Henley on backing vocals. The remaining singles (&quot;You Say You Will&quot; and &quot;Down on My Knees&quot;) peaked within the top twenty of the country songs chart. &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot; would later certify platinum in sales from the RIAA.
Yearwood released her third album in 1993 entitled &quot;The Song Remembers When&quot;. The title track reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart that year. The record was recorded in a similar musical style to &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot;, differing with more contemporary arrangements. The album also included collaborations with other artists such as Rodney Crowell and Willie Nelson. The album was later accompanied by a cable television special in 1993, where the title track&#x27;s music video derived from. Yearwood followed the studio album with her first Holiday compilation in 1994 titled &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot;. It included cover versions of holiday standards, such as &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;, &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot;, and &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;.

In February 1995, Yearwood released her fourth studio album, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About You&quot;, which geared more towards adult contemporary styles. The album was given a positive review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; which compared &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About You&quot; to many of Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s albums in the 1970s. The disc included a version of Melissa Etheridge&#x27;s &quot;You Can Sleep While I Drive&quot; and Tammy Wynette&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Til I Get It Right&quot;. &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About You&quot;&#x27;s first two singles reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart: &quot;XXX&#x27;s and OOO&#x27;s (An American Girl)&quot; and the title track. Its third single, &quot;I Wanna Go Too Far&quot; reached the top ten after its release at the end of 1995. Like its predecessors, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About You&quot; eventually sold one million copies in the United States and was certified platinum from the RIAA. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, Yearwood&#x27;s duet with Aaron Neville titled &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; (a cover of the 1961 song by Patsy Cline) won in the category of Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. The award became Yearwood&#x27;s first accolade from the Grammys.

In August 1996, she released her fifth studio album, &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, which had similarities to her previous album. The record mostly contained ballads and the songs featured larger melodies. &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; received mixed reviews by critics. AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, calling the songs &quot;a little uneven&quot;. However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the album, calling the title track an &quot;emotional release of a pounding piano&quot;. &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; spawned the &quot;Believe Me Baby (I Lied)&quot;, which became Yearwood&#x27;s fourth number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The title track was released as the second single and peaked within the top five in 1996. During this period, Yearwood performed at the closing ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics, which were held in Atlanta, Georgia.

===1997–2001: Crossover success===
Yearwood released her first greatest hits compilation in August 1997, &quot;(Songbook) A Collection of Hits&quot;. The album comprised her major hits up to that point. &quot;Songbook&quot; was praised by most music critics, including AllMusic who called it &quot;a near-definitive collection&quot;. The compilation became her first album to peak at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. It also reached the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 4. &quot;Songbook&quot; included three new tracks that were eventually released as singles. &quot;How Do I Live&quot; was the first single issued and was included in the 1997 film &quot;Con Air&quot;. The song was also nominated for Best Song at the Academy Awards. &quot;How Do I Live&quot; was originally recorded by LeAnn Rimes for the film. Rimes&#x27;s version became a major hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number two, while Yearwood&#x27;s version peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The song also reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album&#x27;s remaining singles also became major hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Chart. &quot;In Another&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (a duet with Garth Brooks) peaked at number 2 on the country chart and the third single, &quot;Perfect Love&quot; reached number one in early 1998. Additionally, Yearwood won a series of accolades. This included accolades from the Grammy Awards, the Country Music Association Awards, and the Academy of Country Music. &quot;Songbook&quot; would become Yearwood&#x27;s highest selling album, selling four million copies in the United States, eventually being certified 4× Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.
Yearwood issued first studio album two years later, &quot;Where Your Road Leads&quot; (1998). It was her first album produced by Tony Brown, with her five previous albums being produced by Garth Fundis. The singles, &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, &quot;Powerful Thing&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Still Love You More&quot; became top ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The title track, was another collaboration with Garth Brooks and became a top twenty hit single. The album gained mostly positive reviews. About.com reviewed the album and gave it four stars, calling it &quot;one of her best albums&quot;. It was also reviewed by Allmusic, which also gave the release four out of five stars. During this time, Yearwood engaged in additional ventures. In the summer of 1998, she performed with singer Luciano Pavarotti to benefit Liberian children. In 1999, she was inducted as a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Porter Wagoner, performing a cover Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams (Of You)&quot; the night of her induction. She is still a member to date.

Following a second divorce, Yearwood released her seventh studio album in March 2000 titled &quot;Real Live Woman&quot;. In similarity to &quot;Hearts in Armor&quot;, the record reflected emotional conflicts following the separation. The album contained twelve tracks and included covers of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Sad Eyes&quot; and Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;Try Me Again&quot;. It was given critical acclaim from AllMusic, quoting &quot;Real Live Woman&quot; as a &quot;measured, deliberate record in the best possible sense.&quot; The album sold 500,000 copies in the United States and spawned two singles: the title track and &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;.

In 2001, Yearwood released her eighth studio record &quot;Inside Out&quot;. It was produced by Mark Wright. The album included a collaboration from Don Henley on the title track, as well as Rosanne Cash and Vince Gill. AllMusic called the release &quot;bound to inspire fans and fellow artists alike&quot;, calling Yearwood&#x27;s voice &quot;timeless&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four out of five stars calling, &quot;Love Alone&quot; and &quot;Melancholy Blue&quot; the best songs on the record. The album spawned the single &quot;I Would&#x27;ve Loved You Anyway&quot;, which reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

===2002–2016: &quot;Jasper County&quot;, record label switch and new career directions===
Following her 2001 album, Yearwood spent time with family and eventually established a romantic relationship with Garth Brooks. In September 2005, she released her first album of new recordings in four years, &quot;Jasper County&quot;. The album reunited her with Fundis on production duties, and took its name from Jasper County, Georgia, the Georgia county in which she was raised. The album consisted of mostly upbeat Soul-styled songs, including &quot;Sweet Love&quot;, and &quot;Who Invented the Wheel&quot;. It received positive reviews by critics, including AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who called it &quot;an album that stretches further musically than most of her albums while being more cohesive than most of her records as well.&quot; It received five stars from About.com, praising the songs &quot;Georgia Rain&quot;, &quot;Who Invented the Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Standing Out in a Crowd&quot;. The album became her third to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. It also peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 117,000 copies within its first week. Its first week sales eclipsed those of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&quot;, which was released within the same week. The first single, &quot;Georgia Rain&quot;, peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, becoming her first major hit since 2002. The second single, &quot;Trying to Love You&quot; was released to radio October 31, reaching number 52. Within a month of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Jasper County&quot; certified gold from the RIAA, becoming Yearwood&#x27;s eleventh Gold certification of her career.
In May 2007, Yearwood announced her departure from MCA Nashville Records and her signing with the independent label Big Machine Records. Yearwood and the label&#x27;s CEO, Scott Borchetta met when she originally worked for MTM Records in the late 1980s. She then worked with Borchetta at MCA during the 1990s. Following her separation, MCA released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, which included her major hits between 1991 and 2001.

After signing with the label, Yearwood announced plans for the recording of her tenth studio album. In November 2007, she released &quot;Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love&quot;. The album peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart and reached number thirty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received critical acclaim. AllMusic gave the project four and a half out of five stars, calling it their &quot;album pick&quot;. Reviewer, Thom Jurek stated, &quot;It&#x27;s better than good, it&#x27;s beyond expectation – and it was high after &quot;Jasper County&quot; – it&#x27;s the best example of what a popular record – not just a country one – should aspire to be, period.&quot; Slant Magazine also reviewed the record, giving it four and a half stars, calling it &quot;a testament to the vitality, intelligence, and soulfulness of modern country&#x27;s best music.&quot; The title track was released as the first single in July 2007, peaking at number 19 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second single, &quot;This Is Me You&#x27;re Talking To&quot; was released in January 2008. The song received critical acclaim, notably from Engine 145, who called it &quot;one of the best singles of the year&quot;.

After beginning a successful Food Network cooking show and several cookbooks, Yearwood went into hiatus from her solo music career. Although she did not focus on solo projects, she remained active in the music industry. From 2009 to 2014, Yearwood accompanied husband Garth Brooks in his concert residency called Garth at Wynn. The residence was located at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yearwood performed songs as a guest artist in the show. The Las Vegas production ran for three years, closing in 2014. In 2014, Yearwood joined Brooks on his three-year world tour entitled The Garth Brooks World Tour. During this same time, she briefly embarked on her own brief tour called &quot;Just Because&quot;. In August 2014, Yearwood briefly signed with RCA Records Nashville. Her only album for the label was the 2014 studio album &quot;&quot;. It contained 16 of her major hits re-recorded for the album and several new songs. The title track was released as the lead single and featured guest vocals from Kelly Clarkson. The album debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and the lead single peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart.

In 2016, Yearwood appeared in the live television musical &quot;The Passion&quot;. As a result, she was also featured on the event&#x27;s soundtrack, performing new versions of several well-known songs including; &quot;Hands&quot;, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; and &quot;Broken&quot;. &quot;Broken&quot; became Yearwood&#x27;s first hit on the Christian charts, peaking at number 47 and also reaching number 17 on the Adult Contemporary charts. In late 2016 she joined Garth Brooks on their first collaborative studio album titled &quot;Christmas Together&quot;. The album featured covers of classic holiday songs and an original track written by the pair called &quot;What I&#x27;m Thankful for (The Thanksgiving Song)&quot;. Following this, Yearwood was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on the song &quot;Forever Country&quot;. The song was created to celebrate 50 years of the CMA Awards.

===2018–present: Return to music===

In late 2018 Yearwood announced the release of a new album consisting of songs previously recorded by Frank Sinatra. Titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Frank&quot;, it was recorded live at the Capitol Records building and was backed by a full piece orchestra. Yearwood used Sinatra&#x27;s original microphone during the recording process. It was released in December 2018, exclusively at Williams Sonoma stores, and worldwide on February 14, 2019. The album peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Albums chart. In his review, Kevin John Coyne of &quot;Country Universe&quot; praised the release, giving it four of five possible stars. In discussing the album, Coyne commented, &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Frank is a delightful detour, and while it doesn&#x27;t curb the hunger for more country music from the greatest female artist of the greatest generation of female artists, it is chock full of reminders of how she earned that distinction in the first place.&quot; Trisha Yearwood performed the Sinatra covers on March 7, 2020, with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Timothy Muffitt. Yearwood was invited to perform with the BRSO as the 2020 selection of the &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series.

In 2019, Yearwood announced plans for her twelfth studio album, &quot;Every Girl&quot;. Its lead single &quot;Every Girl in This Town&quot; was issued in June 2019. The song debuted at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Airplay chart, marking the highest chart debut of her career. &quot;Every Girl&quot; was released in August 2019. It featured collaborations with Garth Brooks, Kelly Clarkson, and Don Henley. The album peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums chart and number 57 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. &quot;Every Girl&quot; received critical praise upon its release. Allmusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek gave the album 4 of 5 stars, calling it &quot;more commanding and more emotionally resonant than in years past.&quot; &quot;Roughstock&quot;&#x27;s Matt Bjorke commented, &quot;Trisha Yearwood has chosen fourteen diverse songs which showcase her pristine voice, an instrument as strong today as it has ever been, if not more powerful.&quot; Yearwood embarked on her first solo tour in 6 years to support the album, which launched in October 2019. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of her career, Yearwood released a deluxe edition of &quot;Every Girl&quot; in August 2021. This contained an acoustic version of her debut single &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with the Boy&quot;, along with new songs &quot;I Dare You to Love&quot; and &quot;Shallow&quot;, a duet with Garth Brooks.

The cookbook included other recipes passed down from her family and liner notes describing each recipe. In total, 120 recipes were included. The book contained recipes for such foods as fried chicken, ribs, meatloaf, and cheesecake. Garth Brooks wrote the book&#x27;s foreword, stating how he was always fond of her cooking style. &quot;Georgia Cooking&quot; reached number 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

The book contained recipes passed down through her mother, aunts, cousins and longtime friends. Yearwood stated that she dedicated many of the cookbook&#x27;s recipes to relatives, such as Brooks, who also provided the foreword. &quot;Home Cooking&quot; would also reach number 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Yearwood&#x27;s cookbook was the cover article for the April 2010 issue of &quot;Redbook Magazine&quot;, where she explained that many of the recipes featured in the cookbook were &quot;some of the best memories of her childhood&quot;. Later that year, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine included &quot;Home Cooking with Trisha Yearwood&quot; on their list of &quot;The Five Worst Cookbooks of 2010&quot;, noting its recipes are &quot;loaded with fat and cholesterol&quot;, specifically citing one called &quot;Garth&#x27;s Breakfast Bowl&quot; which &quot;includes eight large eggs, a pound each of bacon and sausage, cheese tortellini, cheddar cheese, tater tots, and B.O.B (Bowl Of Butter).&quot; In 2015, Yearwood released her third cooking writing endeavor called &quot;Trisha&#x27;s Table&quot;.

According to Food Network&#x27;s senior vice president, viewers enjoyed seeing &quot;different sides&quot; of Yearwood: &quot;Our viewers loved seeing a different side of Trisha. Her impressive cooking skills and family recipes, coupled with her natural southern charm, really resonated with our audience...We&#x27;re thrilled Trisha will be returning for a second season with more delicious dishes and family traditions.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Trisha&#x27;s Southern Kitchen&quot; won an Emmy award for &quot;Outstanding Culinary Program&quot;. The show has since been nominated for additional Emmy accolades. In a 2017 interview, Yearwood stated that she would like to continue hosting the program for &quot;as long as she can.&quot;

In 1997, Yearwood began playing a recurring role on the CBS military drama &quot;JAG&quot;, where she played Lieutenant Commander Teresa Coulter, a Navy coroner and forensic specialist, who develops feelings for one of the main characters. She appeared on the show at various times until 2002.

She appeared in an episode of TLC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on September 3, 2013.

In March 2016, Yearwood appeared as Mary in the live television musical &quot;The Passion&quot; based on the Dutch franchise of the same name. The show is a contemporary retelling of the Passion of Jesus Christ set to popular music with a mixture of live and pre-recorded segments. The event was broadcast live on Fox. The show received mixed reviews. In one interview by Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Yearwood&#x27;s Mary may have been singing about Jesus, but she never interacted with him. While he was mostly seen in segments shot around the city, she sang to the crowd gathered in front of that big white stage, belting out You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone to no one in particular.&quot; A review by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Yearwood&#x27;s performance of the songs she performed &quot;expressive&quot;, but lacking the live elements as it was filmed through pre-recorded scenes. In 2019, Yearwood hosted the tenth annual &quot;CMA Country Christmas&quot;. The special was taped in September 2019 and featured performances by various artists including Tori Kelly, CeCe Winans and Brett Young.

==Artistry==

Yearwood possesses an alto vocal range. Yearwood has stated she particularly enjoys singing harmonies, expounding, &quot;Because I could read music, I was always the one in the school chorus who got the alto part because I could read. I&#x27;m never singing the melody and always singing the harmony in church.&quot; Her musical tastes originated from classic artists her parents listened to. This included Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette. However, as Yearwood developed into her teenage years, she developed a liking for country rock artists such as Allman Brothers and James Taylor. She also cited the Eagles and Gordon Lightfoot as influences.

According to Yearwood, her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt. She discovered her music after her parents bought her Ronstadt&#x27;s studio album &quot;Simple Dreams&quot;. Yearwood commented to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that while Ronstadt&#x27;s music was considered pop, her phrasing and emotional style appeared country. Music critics and writers have drawn similarities between Ronstadt and Yearwood&#x27;s voice. In an interview for Ronstadt&#x27;s album &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, Peter Galvin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented, &quot;Listening to Yearwood&#x27;s new album, Thinkin&#x27; About You, you would sometimes swear you were hearing Ronstadt circa 1976. Yearwood&#x27;s voice is thinner and more pliable than Ronstadt&#x27;s, but both resort to a hearty squawk when passion takes them over, and both possess low honey tones.&quot; She also reported to be influenced by Emmylou Harris.

Yearwood&#x27;s musical style has been considered &quot;country pop&quot; and &quot;adult contemporary&quot;. Additionally, her artistic choices have been considered unique from writers because of song choice and quality. When ranking her &quot;top 10&quot; songs, staff from &quot;The Boot&quot; magazine explained her musical quality, &quot;Yearwood has carved out a very successful and unique niche for herself by finding some of the highest-quality songs in the genre, then recording them in arrangements that bring them to life in a way that is sonically different from any other artist in the commercial country marketplace.&quot; Laura McClellan of &quot;Taste of Country&quot; explained that it is Yearwood&#x27;s diverse musical styles that make her music quality and career successful. McClellan also noted, &quot;Her songs have shaped country music — particularly for female artists — for decades.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Yearwood has participated in various philanthropic events. She recorded a version of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; for the Sears &quot;Heroes at Home&quot; program in 2008. The song was available for download via the Sears website. The project supported the families of service men and women during the Christmas holiday season. Yearwood has been an active member of the charity home building group Habitat for Humanity. Yearwood first joined with husband Garth Brooks in 2006. They assisted in the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief by building flood walls in New Orleans and protective structures in Mississippi. Between May 2 to 10, 2009, Yearwood participated in &quot;National Women Build Week&quot; near her home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The project saw two hundred crews of women learn to build houses in Atlanta, Georgia and Oklahoma. For the project, Yearwood learned to construct and build simple and affordable houses for Habitat for Humanity construction sites nationwide. On Mother&#x27;s Day, Yearwood, her sister, mother and niece joined the project as well. Many of these Habitat for Humanity projects have been collaborations with former president Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Yearwood and her husband Garth Brooks performed an informal concert broadcast on Facebook Live. The website crashed multiple times as an estimated 5.2 million streamed the broadcast. As a result of this, Brooks and Yearwood performed a concert in the same format the following week, broadcast live on CBS, along with a donation of $1 million to relief efforts. The CBS special scored an estimated 5.6 million viewers.

Reminding Georgans that their vote matters, Yearwood encouraged voters in the state to participate in the December 6, 2020 runoff election between GOP nominee Herschel Walker and Senator Raphael Warnock, directing voters to non-partisan voter advocate organization VoteRiders for information and assistance with voter ID requirements.

==Personal life==

Yearwood married her first husband, Chris Latham, in 1987. The pair divorced in 1991. In 1994, she married Robert Reynolds, founding bassist for The Mavericks. During their marriage, the couple lived in a log cabin-styled home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The pair divorced in 1999 after five years of marriage. Yearwood commented that the separation was &quot;difficult&quot; in a 1999 interview with &quot;Country Weekly&quot;, &quot;Since I do hang on to the past with my fingernails, divorce was difficult...It&#x27;s a serious decision involving someone you&#x27;re tied to emotionally, so it&#x27;s hard to move on. And it&#x27;s easy to drag things out so you don&#x27;t have to face people talking about you.&quot;

Yearwood and Garth Brooks had been friends and musical partners before romantically seeing each other. According to Brooks, his first encounter with Yearwood felt like &quot;that feeling when you just meet your wife&quot;. During this period, Yearwood and Brooks were both married to other people. For these reasons, they remained friends during the first half of their careers. Following Brooks&#x27;s divorce and Yearwood&#x27;s second divorce, the two began dating around 2000. They became engaged in 2005 when Brooks proposed to Yearwood onstage amidst a crowd of 7,000 in Bakersfield, California. The pair married on December 10, 2005. The wedding took place at the couple&#x27;s home in Owasso, Oklahoma. Brooks&#x27;s three children were also part of the wedding ceremony.

According to Yearwood, the pair made a commitment not to spend time apart. It is estimated by Yearwood that the couple spends about five days away from each other per year. In an interview with &quot;People Magazine&quot; she explained this further, &quot;We really have made a conscious effort since getting married to not be apart, so we&#x27;ve toured together. If I&#x27;m doing something, he&#x27;ll be with me, even if you don&#x27;t see him, he&#x27;ll be in the hotel or around...And we&#x27;re not always together, but we&#x27;ve been married before, and we decided we don&#x27;t want to be apart. So [we said] let&#x27;s make an effort to make sure that&#x27;s our priority and we&#x27;ve been able to do it.&quot; She became a stepmother to Brooks&#x27;s three children following their marriage. In a 2017 interview, Yearwood explained her new role, &quot;I had no idea what I was doing. I have to say that now as these girls have grown—they&#x27;re adults now on their own—it&#x27;s been a part of my life that I would have never even known to dream about, and it&#x27;s been so rewarding to get to be a part of this family.&quot;

<text>Elmer Earl Butch Hartman IV (born January 10, 1965) is an American animator, illustrator, writer, producer, director, and actor. He is best known for creating the animated television series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, &quot;T.U.F.F. Puppy&quot;, and &quot;Bunsen Is a Beast&quot; for Nickelodeon. He founded the company, Billionfold Inc. in 2003, to produce the shows. Hartman was an executive producer on &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; for the entirety of its 16-year run. 

In February 2018, Hartman announced his departure from Nickelodeon after almost 20 years; this resulted in the end of production on &quot;Bunsen Is a Beast&quot; after one season. In 2021, he returned to the studio to produce &quot;The Fairly OddParents: Fairly Odder&quot;, a live-action &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot; sequel which premiered on Paramount+ the following year and aired for one season. In 2023, his first non-secular animated program, &quot;The Garden&quot;, premiered on the Christian streaming service Pure Flix.

==Early life==
Hartman was born in Highland Park, Michigan. He received the nickname Butch as a young boy and continued to use it as an adult. Hartman spent his childhood in Roseville, Michigan, and his teenage years in New Baltimore, Michigan. He graduated from Anchor Bay High School in New Baltimore in 1983, and subsequently attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. He graduated in 1987 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. As a young student, he appeared on &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour;&quot; he won close to $3,000.

==Career==
===Early career===
While still attending CalArts, Hartman interned as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film &quot;An American Tail&quot;. Before graduating, he was a contestant on the Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour for three episodes and shortly after graduating, he was hired as a character designer and storyboard artist for an unidentified &quot;My Little Pony&quot; animated series. As he had no previous experience with storyboards, he was soon fired. Afterwards, he found work with Ruby-Spears, where he worked on &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot; and &quot;Dink, the Little Dinosaur&quot;. He was also a member of the video reference crew for the Disney film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;.

In the early 1990s, he was hired as an artist in the model department at Hanna-Barbera, and was eventually contacted by studio president Fred Seibert to create the shorts &quot;Pfish and Chip&quot; and &quot;Gramps&quot; for his animated incubator series &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. Eventually, he became a writer, director and storyboard artist for several of the early Cartoon Network shows, including &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, and &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;. After his contract with Hanna-Barbera expired, he went to work with Seibert at his newfound Frederator studio, on his successor incubator series, &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; for Nickelodeon.

During his time working at Hanna-Barbera, he became acquainted with future &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane. The two would later go on to make the short &quot;Zoomates&quot; together for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. The character Dr. Elmer Hartman in &quot;Family Guy&quot; was named after Hartman. He also voiced various characters in the show&#x27;s first seasons.

===Working at Nickelodeon===

His biggest success came in December 1997, when he created &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. The series originally started out as a series of shorts on the anthology show &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;. Eventually, Nickelodeon decided to pick the shorts up as a full series. Premiering in 2001, the adapted series ended up becoming a huge hit, second only in the ratings to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (and it briefly even passed &quot;SpongeBob&quot;″s ratings). Following the third &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; crossover &quot;The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators&quot;, the series ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman&#x27;s forum on February 2, 2007, that 20 more episodes would be produced; the 6th season of &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot; aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the one-hour special &quot;Fairly OddBaby&quot;. From May 1, 2009, to May 3, 2009, the three-part special &quot;Wishology&quot; aired; although that too was originally intended as a series finale, the series was renewed for another season. A tenth season was eventually ordered in 2015. &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; is Nickelodeon&#x27;s second longest-running animated show behind &quot;SpongeBob&quot;.

Due to the success of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, Hartman was asked to create another show for Nickelodeon; Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given the greenlight. The show would later become &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;. To produce the show, Hartman founded his own production company Billionfold Inc. in 2003, which he also used to produce his other projects. &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; received his furthest critical acclaim throughout his career, with Hartman himself acknowledging it as perhaps the best of his programs while acknowledging its cult following. &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; ended production in early 2007.

Around 2008–2009, Hartman began production his third show for Nickelodeon, &quot;T.U.F.F. Puppy&quot;, which premiered in 2010 alongside the &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; spin-off &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;. The series received mixed to positive reviews and ran for three seasons before being cancelled.

His final show, &quot;Bunsen Is a Beast&quot;, aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from January 16, 2017, to February 10, 2018. On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced on his Twitter and YouTube accounts that he had left Nickelodeon as of February 2 after a 20-year run.

===Other works===
In 2015, Hartman launched a &quot;kid-safe [online] network of live shows and cartoons&quot; called The Noog Network.

In October 2017, Hartman launched the podcast &quot;Speech Bubble&quot;, on which he talks about pop culture. Several voice actors have appeared on the podcast, including Rob Paulsen, Tara Strong, Jerry Trainor, Grey Griffin, and Vic Mignogna. After initially posting excerpts on his primary YouTube channel, the podcast videos were later moved to its own dedicated YouTube channel, now including full episodes.

In June 2018, Hartman started a Kickstarter campaign for OAXIS Entertainment, a &quot;family-friendly&quot; streaming service. After the fundraising goal had been reached, it was revealed that OAXIS was planned to be a Christian-themed network, which was not disclosed during the fundraiser. However, Hartman later claimed that, while faith would continue to be a part of his personal life, OAXIS would not be a faith-based service. As of 2025, Hartman has yet to give any updates on OAXIS.

On June 22, 2019, Hartman released the animated web series &quot;HobbyKids Adventures&quot;. This series, produced by PocketWatch Inc., was created for YouTube channel HobbyKidsTV. On 13 July, Hartman released a book, &quot;Mad Hustle&quot;, which details the ins and outs of pitching and selling a show in Hollywood.

In 2019, Hartman created the Christian animated web series &quot;The Garden&quot;, which he co-produced with his wife Julieann. Hartman has planned at least two seasons of the series and plan to launch a subscription-based app for &quot;The Garden&quot; in late 2022. Hartman&#x27;s further plans for the property include creating a VBS curriculum for churches and illustrating a children&#x27;s Bible published by Thomas Nelson, titled &quot;The Garden Children&#x27;s Bible&quot;, which stars the characters from &quot;The Garden&quot; and is scheduled to release in 2023. The series premiered on Pure Flix on January 1, 2023.

In February 2021, Hartman was accused of plagiarism when he published his commissioned artwork of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; character Mikasa Ackerman, in which similarities were noted to a 2018 artwork of a Japanese artist. The artist confirmed Hartman did not receive permission.

Hartman was credited as an executive producer on &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; revival series &quot;The Fairly OddParents: Fairly Odder&quot; and &quot;The Fairly OddParents: A New Wish.&quot;

==Personal life==
As of 2024, Hartman lives in Bell Canyon, California, with his wife, Julieann, and daughters, Carly and Sophia Hartman. He also has three younger brothers. Hartman is an openly devout born-again Christian and young-Earth creationist, converting in 2000 after hearing a sermon by Frederick K. C. Price.

In 2005, Hartman, along with his wife, co-founded Hartman House, a non-profit organization which supports those in developing nations, as well as poverty stricken areas in the United States. By 2017, Hartman House has built two homes for families in Guatemala, fed nearly 7,200 families with Thanksgiving meals in the U.S., and funded aid projects for orphanages in Uganda and Haiti. At Hartman House events, Hartman usually draws and autographs items related to his work for children.

<doc id="1004065" wikidata="Q180106" url="?curid=1004065" title="O-I Glass">
<text>O-I Glass, Inc. is an American company that specializes in container glass products. It is one of the world&#x27;s leading manufacturers of packaging products, holding the position of largest manufacturer of glass containers in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe (after acquiring BSN Glasspack in 2004).

== Company ==

While legally known as Owens-Illinois, Inc., the company changed its trade name to O-I in 2005 to group its global operations under a single, cross-language and cross-culture brand name.

The company&#x27;s headquarters were previously located at One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio. The headquarters were moved in late 2006 to the Levis Commons complex in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company is the successor to the Owens Bottle Company founded in 1903 by Michael Joseph Owens, who made the first automated bottle-making machine, and Edward Drummond Libbey. In 1929, the Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company to become Owens-Illinois, Inc. Six years later, Owens-Illinois merged with Corning Incorporated to form Owens Corning.

In 1971 Owens-Illinois produced an early commercial plasma display, the digivue.

Until July 2007, the company was also a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I included containers, closures, and prescription containers. In July 2007 O-I completed the sale of its entire plastics packaging business to Rexam, a United Kingdom listed packaging manufacturer.

Owens-Illinois was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from June 1, 1959, until March 12, 1987. The company was added to the S&amp;P 500 Index in January 2009. Owens-Illinois was one of the original S&amp;P 500 companies in 1957. It was removed in 1987 (after purchase by KKR), added in 1991 and removed again in 2000.

In October 2010, Owens-Illinois Venezuela C.A was expropriated by President Hugo Chávez.

In May 2015, O-I made an offer to purchase the food and beverage glass container business of Mexican company Vitro for $2.15 billion. The acquisition closed in September 2015.

In 2020, a subsidiary of O-I Glass, Paddock Enterprises, entered bankruptcy following numerous asbestos lawsuits filed against the company. All of the company&#x27;s asbestos-related claims were isolated within Paddock and separated from O-I&#x27;s glass-making operations.

==Partnership with NEG==
Owens-Illinois partnered with NEG (Nippon Electric Glass), to produce glass television screens at its Columbus, Ohio, and Pittston, Pennsylvania, plants in the 1970s through the mid-1990s before allowing Techneglas to take over the operations.

==Environmental issues==

Although it has not made asbestos-containing materials since 1958, Owens-Illinois invented, tested, manufactured and distributed KAYLO asbestos containing thermal pipe insulation from 1948 through 1958. Owens-Illinois remains a named defendant in numerous asbestos litigation matters throughout the U.S. Some claims in these cases allege that Owens-Illinois was a participant in the seventh annual Saranac Seminar when the cancer-causing potential of asbestos was studied in the 1950s.

As a result of a pattern of violations producing repeat emissions, its Oregon plant was fined in August 2023 by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. This was their 10th fine.

<text>Tvrđa (&quot;Citadel&quot;) is the old town of the city of Osijek in Croatia. It is the best-preserved and largest ensemble of Baroque buildings in Croatia and consists of a Habsburg star fort built on the right bank of the River Drava. Tvrđa has been described by the World Monuments Fund as &quot;a unique example of an eighteenth-century baroque military, administrative, and commercial urban center&quot;.

The star fort was constructed in the immediate vicinity of medieval Osijek after the defeat of the Ottoman forces in 1687, due to Osijek&#x27;s strategic importance. Constructed starting in 1712 to plans by Mathias von Kaiserfeld and then Maximilian Gosseau de Henef, all five planned bastions and two gates were complete by 1715. By 1735, the inner town was finished and three northern bastions had been added. When complete, it was the largest and most advanced Habsburg fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire, consisting of eight bastions and featuring armories, depots, a garrison headquarters, military court, construction office, a garrison physician, guardhouse, officers&#x27; apartments, a military hospital and seven barracks. The completed fort was entirely surrounded with walls and palisades and had four main gates at each side (north, south, east, west). Tvrđa had street lights by 1717 and was the site of the first public water supply in Croatia, opened in 1751.

Tvrđa&#x27;s military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878, with the increasing stability of the surrounding region. Most of the fort walls and fortifications were destroyed in the 1920s due to the obstacle they presented to the development of Osijek. While the fortifications have largely been removed, the fort&#x27;s interior core remains intact and is now home to churches, museums, schools and other public buildings, as well as numerous bars and restaurants. Of the fortification system, only the northern side of the walls now remain intact, as well as parts of the first and eighth bastions along with the northern gate known as the &#x27;water gate&#x27; (&#x27;vodena vrata&#x27;). Tvrđa sustained significant damage during the Croatian War of Independence during the 1990s and was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. It now features on Croatia&#x27;s &#x27;tentative list&#x27; for consideration as a nominee for a World Heritage Site.

==History==

===Medieval and Ottoman eras===

The new name of Osijek first appeared in 1196. The center of medieval Osijek was on the banks of the River Drava where Tvrđa now stands. The town was a trade and port settlement from the early 12th century due to its position on the way from Pécs and Buda southwards. The site was home to the Romanesque church of the Holy Trinity. Between 1526 and 1687 Osijek was ruled by the Ottomans, who did not change the layout of the settlement in any substantial way but introduced Islamic places of worship, giving the area an Oriental appearance. Traces of medieval and Ottoman towns remain to this day, including a remnant of the old Ottoman fortress wall, known today as the &quot;Turkish Wall&quot; () or &quot;Filibey&#x27;s Fort&quot; (), lying next to the Tvrđa access road.

During the Ottoman period, Osijek was internationally known because of the Suleiman Bridge. The construction of the bridge was begun by İbrahim Pasha on 16 August 1526 following the orders of Suleiman the Magnificent. The bridge, which connected Osijek and Darda, took the form of a wooden road on piers and was approximately long and wide. Seen as a great threat to Christian Europe the bridge was attacked several times, being destroyed in 1664, when it was set on fire on the orders of Hungarian feudal lord Nicholas VII of Zrin (, ). The bridge was rebuilt during the rule of Suleiman II. Finally, it was burned down by the Habsburg armies in 1686.

===Design and construction===

====First layout in late 17th century====
Development of the military settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans out of the city during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban&#x27;s principles of military engineering.

The town magistrate was established in 1690, while the plans for the new fort were still being drawn up, and one of its documents from August of the same year described the condition of the settlement as &quot;ruinous&quot;. Two months later, on 29 October, the Ottoman army suddenly attacked. The attack was repulsed only thanks to a well-organised defense, and the Turks withdrew on 6 November, after a brief siege. The event was a clear lesson that the construction of the fort must not be delayed any further. The first phase of Tvrđa&#x27;s conversion into a Baroque fortress was based on the plan devised by the engineer Mathias von Kaiserfeld from 1691.

====Second layout in 18th century====
The original plan for Tvrđa was drafted because of the need to reinforce the town walls, but did not include provisions to redesign the interior and envisaged largely uncontrolled development. New plans for a fort on the right bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef. Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way. Starting in August 1712, Austrian engineers, supervised by the fort&#x27;s commander, General Johann Stephan von Beckers, built barracks, staff headquarters, churches and monasteries, surrounded by system of moats, bastions and gun positions, respecting Gosseau&#x27;s design. The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period.

By 1715, all five planned bastions and two gates were complete. An additional, western, gate leading to the Upper Town was added in 1716. The construction of the outwork on the opposite bank of the River Drava, designed to offer protection from the north and to serve as a bridgehead, was completed by 1721. The final, fourth gate, leading to the Lower Town, was not added until 1783. Construction of the inner town was completed by 1733, and in 1735 three additional northern bastions were completed, along with a post office, the fort&#x27;s construction office and a hospital. The completed fort had &quot;eight bastions, two armories, two major depots, garrison headquarters, military court, construction office, garrison physician, guardhouse, officer apartments, military hospital and seven barracks&quot;. Based on the &#x27;ring model&#x27;, the fortifications took up an area of , making Tvrđa the largest fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire.
Gosseau&#x27;s plan left space for churches to be built where mosques had once stood. Initially, converted mosques were used as churches, but Franciscans started to build a Baroque church in 1709 and it was consecrated in 1732. A Franciscan monastery was built between 1699 and 1705, with a new wing being added between 1731 and 1733, which subsequently became a new monastery in 1761. In 1725, the Jesuits commenced construction of the parish church of St. Michael (), following the construction of their own monastery. This church was in use after 1734, despite being incomplete. A Holy Trinity column was erected in the fort&#x27;s main square in 1730 as a plague monument featuring volutes with pedestals on which four protectors against the plague are placed. Four additional pedestals were added to the monument in 1784, each featuring a statue of a saint. Tvrđa had street lighting as early as 1717. The first system to supply public water in Croatia was opened in Tvrđa in 1751.

In the mid-18th century there were reportedly more than 35 inns in Tvrđa, estimated to an account for one in three of the fort&#x27;s buildings. Crown prince Joseph stayed in one of the inns when visiting Osijek. In 1786, as Joseph II, he decreed the merger of the Upper Town, Lower Town and Tvrđa into one single town council.

===19th and 20th century===
As early as the second half of the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvrđa, and even maintenance of the fort became a burden. In 1809 Osijek was granted free royal town status. Osijek&#x27;s council was accommodated in a building at the south-eastern corner of Tvrđa&#x27;s main square.

Tvrđa&#x27;s military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878 as a result of increasing political and military stability in the region. Two north-western bastions were demolished in the 1870s, making way for Ambrose&#x27;s Park (). Construction of the &quot;Royal Grammar School&quot; started in 1881, and the &quot;Royal General Secondary School&quot; was completed in 1890. Episcopal seminary was also built in the south-western corner of the main square in 1898. These were the only buildings erected within Tvrđa walls in the last three decades of the 19th century.

As Osijek grew as a city, the fort&#x27;s presence hindered the potential for urban development. The demolition of most of the fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction of an electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called &#x27;water gate&#x27; were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.

From February to June 1986, the fortress town was used as a filming location for the epic American miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. It played the role of the almost identical town of Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia, which had been converted to a concentration camp known as the &quot;Paradise Ghetto&quot;, to which prominent Jews were sent by the Nazis. Stars Jane Seymour, John Gielgud and Robert Stephens filmed throughout the town.

The fort sustained considerable damage during the Croatian War of Independence, which lasted from 1991 until 1995. The war brought structural damage from collapsing roofs, walls and floors. These damages threaten plaster, sculpture and murals that lack proper protection and are subject to continuing decay.

==Present day==
After the fortress&#x27;s military importance decreased at the end of the 19th century, Tvrđa became a center of administrative, educational, cultural, and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region. The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707, to be later expanded and renewed, and the first printing press started working in 1735. The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates, Lavoslav Ružička and Vladimir Prelog, along with Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković (Milankovitch cycles), were all alumni (graduates) of the Tvrđa schools. The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the former general headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence. The Faculty of Food Technology has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek, from the mid-17th century until the beginning of the 1990s. Other present-day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium, Franjo Kuhač Music School (former Roman Catholic Seminary), Jesuit Classical Gymnasium (former logistics barracks built in the mid-18th century), and the Secondary School of Economics (former grammar school for girls).

According to the 2001 census, within the Tvrđa city district, there are 10,277 inhabitants living in 3,310 households. The fort interior is now a centre of Osijek&#x27;s nightlife. There are numerous bars and restaurants in Tvrđa. The fort hosts the Museum of Slavonia, the largest general-type museum in Croatia, located in Tvrđa since 1946. The former town museum and archives building today houses the &quot;State Directorate for Monument Protection&quot;, a department of the Croatian Ministry of Culture. The patron saint of the Tvrđa is Saint Michael, and his feast day of September 29 is celebrated as the day of the Tvrđa city district.

==Heritage status==
The World Monuments Fund has described Tvrđa as &quot;a unique example of an eighteenth-century baroque military, administrative, and commercial urban center&quot;. Tvrđa is on Croatia&#x27;s &#x27;Tentative List&#x27; for consideration as nominee for the World Heritage Site. During the 1991–95 conflict in Croatia, 90 per cent of the buildings in Tvrđa were damaged to some extent and the fort was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. It has not appeared on the list, published every two years, since.

The building of the general headquarters, dating from 1726, and the ground plan of the fortress were depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 200 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.

The Agency for Restoration of Osijek Tvrđa () was established in 1999. Its stated goals are protection, restoration and revitalization of Tvrđa. The restoration process aims to preserve architectural, historical and aesthetic qualities of Tvrđa in full accordance with the restoration principles set by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, while maintaining its multifunctional character. International cooperation is also envisioned, in particular with the Council of Europe. The Agency is jointly funded by the Government of Croatia, Osijek-Baranja County and the City of Osijek.

<doc id="1004078" wikidata="Q475730" url="?curid=1004078" title="Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)">
<text>Carlos Humberto Ruiz Gutiérrez (born 15 September 1979), initially nicknamed &quot;El Pescadito&quot; or &quot;The Little Fish&quot; but later became &quot;El Pescado&quot; or &quot;The Fish&quot; (even by Spanish-speakers), is a Guatemalan former professional footballer who played as a striker. A product of CSD Municipal&#x27;s youth academy, Ruiz played for five MLS clubs (Los Angeles Galaxy, FC Dallas, Toronto FC, Philadelphia Union, and D.C. United), scoring 88 goals in 182 MLS regular-season matches and 16 goals in the post-season, which is the second most post-season goals in MLS history. In 2002, he was named the MLS&#x27;s Most Valuable Player of the season.

He was a member of the Guatemalan national team from 1998 to 2016. He is regarded to be the greatest Guatemalan footballer of all time. He served as captain, is the player with the most caps and is the all-time top scorer of the Guatemala national team. He played in five World Cup qualification phases and in September 2016, he became the all-time top scorer in World Cup qualification with 39 goals, although his country never qualified for the tournament.

In 2019, Ruiz worked for a television channel in Miami.

==Club career==
===Early career (1995–2002)===
Ruiz, born in Guatemala City, Guatemala, started his footballing career in local club San Carlos. At the age of 12, he joined the youth divisions of Club Social y Deportivo CSD Municipal, and at 16, he made his professional debut. He became a starter for Municipal and a young star in the Guatemalan league until 2000, when he traveled to Europe to play for a short time alongside compatriot Guillermo Ramírez at Greek club PAS Giannina. After a stint with PAS, he returned to Municipal.

===LA Galaxy (2002–2005)===

In January 2002, Ruiz signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy. He was initially skeptical, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anything about MLS or soccer in the U.S. Everything we hear about Major League Soccer is not so good ... we hear that all the players come here to finish their careers.&quot; However, he found the level to be better than he imagined, saying: &quot;In the beginning, I was not happy to come here. But after a couple of games and when I see the level of soccer here, I was excited to play here.&quot; Once in MLS, Ruiz shone immediately. In his debut season in 2002, Ruiz scored 24 goals (winning the MLS Golden Boot), leading the Galaxy to the MLS Cup by scoring the 2nd golden goal in MLS Cup history, a year after Dwayne de Rosario was the first to accomplish the feat in 2001. He was named the MLS Most Valuable Player that year. In the playoffs, he scored eight goals and added two assists, totaling 18 points and setting an MLS record for goals and points in a single postseason. Ruiz&#x27; overtime goal in extra time of MLS Cup 2002 gave Galaxy the title.

In his second season, Ruiz cooled off significantly, but the forward still finished the season tied with Taylor Twellman for the league lead in goals with 15. He continued to statistically drop in 2004, scoring 11 goals. Ruiz had trials at English side Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 2003–04 season.

===FC Dallas (2005–2007)===
In 2005, when Landon Donovan expressed his desire to return to MLS, the Galaxy traded Ruiz to FC Dallas for the #1 allocation in the MLS pecking order, so that they could acquire Donovan. Ruiz finished his first year in Dallas with 11 goals and two assists. During the postseason in the conference semifinals, Ruiz scored two goals in the second leg match against the Colorado Rapids, but FC Dallas were eliminated on penalty kicks. In February 2006, MLS fully bought Ruiz&#x27;s contract rights from his former club, Municipal, and FC Dallas was able to negotiate a multi-year deal. In March 2006, a bicycle kick goal he scored against D.C. United was selected as the &quot;Goal of the Decade&quot; in MLS through online voting.

During a 2007 game against the Houston Dynamo, Ruiz was involved in a controversial incident with Houston midfielder Ricardo Clark. Following a corner kick in which the two players became entangled, Clark violently kicked Ruiz in the upper body as he lay on the pitch hoping to draw a foul. Ruiz then hit Clark&#x27;s back with his knee during the subsequent play, and both players were sent off, with Clark also receiving the longest suspension in league history.

Following the conclusion of the 2007 season, Ruiz appeared to be unwilling to return to Dallas and to be holding out for a move back to the Galaxy. Earlier attempts to produce a trade faltered due to Ruiz being a grandfathered Designated Player, with the Galaxy already having other players in the same situation (Landon Donovan and David Beckham). In January 2008, FC Dallas traded Ruiz to the Galaxy for an undisclosed cash allocation and the Galaxy&#x27;s natural second-round pick in the following year&#x27;s MLS SuperDraft. At his departure, he said, &quot;I did everything I could to win a championship with Dallas. Unfortunately, it did not happen.&quot;

====Return to LA Galaxy and trade to Toronto FC (2008)====
He spoke about the Galaxy to ESPN analyst Andrea Canales: &quot;I still think the Galaxy is the best team in the U.S. They&#x27;re the best organization. The Galaxy have always had famous players. They continue to be a team that people always follow,&quot; and added his personal relief to be on the Galaxy team, &quot;I&#x27;m so glad I came to the Galaxy and not another team, because I would have felt like I was starting over.&quot; In the season opener, however, Ruiz suffered a knee injury and was unable to play for over a month. While Ruiz was injured, the Galaxy found unexpected striking potential in Edson Buddle, and even after coming back from the injury, Ruiz was notably still left off the travel roster for a high-profile game against D.C. United. He scored his first goal of the 2008 season on 19 July in a game against New York Red Bulls.

Ruiz was traded on 19 August 2008 to Toronto FC who in-turn released Laurent Robert to make room for Ruiz. He was expected to help solve TFC&#x27;s goal scoring woes as he had scored 82 goals in MLS at that point in his career, but he managed only five first team games in Toronto, during which he scored no goals. He was released by Toronto in early 2009 after they signed Dwayne De Rosario.

===Olimpia (2009)===
On 31 January 2009, Ruiz signed a contract with Paraguayan club Olimpia Asunción under the request of then-coach Ever Hugo Almeida. Ruiz and his compatriot Carlos Figueroa joined the club together. Both of the players were coached by Ever Hugo Almeida at CSD Municipal between 2001 and 2003. Ruiz joined Olimpia Asunción on a non-contract, but on the promise of signing a contract. Amongst Ruiz&#x27; most remembered goals, came in a 2–0 victory in the Paraguayan superclasico against Cerro Porteño and a free kick against 3 de Febrero. He also scored a hat trick against Rubio Ñu in a 5–3 victory for Olimpia. In total, Ruiz scored 10 goals in 18 appearances, becoming the team&#x27;s leading goal scorer and the third leading goal scorer in the 2009 Torneo Apertura. Ruiz finished with Olimpia Asunción in June 2009. Ruiz departed the club before the 2009 Torneo Apertura finished. The decision of leaving Olimpia was because of the circumstances and was not his, as the club experienced it&#x27;s worse administrative moment. Since departing Olimpia, Ruiz became friends with Denis Caniza, Mario Jara and Juan Lucero and remained in contact with them.

===Puebla (2009–2010)===
Ruiz signed with Puebla on 30 June 2009 under head coach José Luis Sánchez Solá. On 25 July 2009, in a game against Tigres, he scored his first goal for Puebla on a penalty kick. He wore number 20, which is the same number he previously wore for LA Galaxy, FC Dallas, and the Guatemala national team.

===Aris FC (2010)===
Ruiz agreed to join Aris FC on 12 July 2010. He made his debut on 18 August 2010 in the playoff round of the Europa League against Austria Wien, becoming the first Guatemalan footballer ever to appear in a UEFA competition match. The first leg was played in Thessaloniki with Ruiz netting on his debut to give Aris a 1–0 victory. In the second leg played in Vienna, Ruiz scored again in a 1–1 draw, giving Aris a 2–1 aggregate victory and sending them through to the group stage, where he scored one more goal against Rosenborg.

===Philadelphia Union (2011)===
After trialling with the club during the 2011 MLS pre-season, Ruiz signed with the Philadelphia Union on 22 February 2011. On 26 March he scored Philadelphia&#x27;s winning goal in the home opener of the 2011 MLS season against the Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Ruiz also scored the &quot;MLS Goal of the Week&quot; in Week 10 of the season with a game-winning 35 yard strike against the Chicago Fire.

===Veracruz (2011)===
On 3 August 2011, Ruíz was transferred to Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz. He scored his first goal for the club against Correcaminos during the 4th week of the 2011 Apertura tournament and finished the year with six goals in five matches. Ruiz remained a part of the club until 2013, though he was inactive for nearly a year.

===D.C. United (2013)===
On 31 January 2013, Municipal announced that Ruiz would be rejoining the club. However, this move was cancelled after Veracruz refused to terminate Ruiz&#x27;s contract. On 20 February 2013, DC United announced that the club had signed Ruiz via the MLS allocation process to a one-year deal. On 30 October 2013, DC United announced that they had declined the contract option on Ruiz.

===Return to Guatemala (2014)===
On 8 February 2014, Municipal announced that Ruiz would be rejoining the club. He signed an 18-month contract that made him the highest paid footballer ever in Central America.

=== Return to FC Dallas (2016) ===
On 15 September 2016, FC Dallas announced that they had signed Ruiz for a second stint with the club.

==International career==
Overall, Ruiz earned 133 caps and scored 68 goals for his country. He played in World Cup qualification campaigns for the FIFA World Cups of 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. He played his first international match on 11 November 1998, a friendly against Mexico, and scored his first goal against El Salvador at the 1999 UNCAF Nations Cup. Ruiz represented Guatemala at the 1999 Pan American Games. In 2000, as the Guatemala national futsal team had begun its development, Ruiz was selected, along with other 11-a-side football players, as part of the squad that competed at the 2000 Futsal World Championship, hosted by Guatemala. He scored one goal in the tournament.

After scoring eight goals in nine matches during the 2002 World Cup qualification campaign and already having a successful career in the MLS, Ruiz was the focal point of the Guatemalan team in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, leading the team in scoring as they reached the final stage of the CONCACAF region. However, they would not qualify for the World Cup.

On 14 June 2008, Ruiz broke Juan Carlos Plata&#x27;s all-time individual goal-scoring record for Guatemala by scoring four goals against Saint Lucia in Guatemala&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualification opening match. Ruiz had scored 39 goals, four more than Plata&#x27;s total. Ruiz also became the first Guatemalan player to score four goals in a World Cup qualification match. On 10 September 2008, Ruiz scored two goals against Cuba in Guatemala&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualification in the 3rd match of the 3rd round of qualification of the CONCACAF region. Those two goals extended his all-time individual scoring record for Guatemala to 41 goals, six more than Plata&#x27;s total.

On 9 February 2009, Ruiz announced his retirement from international football. However, on 4 January 2011, he stated that he was returning to international football, making the UNCAF 2011 championship to be held in Panama his first international tournament in two years. He then participated in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, scoring one goal against Grenada in the first round and another one against Mexico in the quarterfinals in a 2–1 defeat.

On 16 October 2012, Ruiz again announced his retirement from international competition after a 3–1 loss to the United States at Livestrong Sporting Park, which eliminated Guatemala from 2014 World Cup qualification. However, he would return to play for Guatemala again and became the second Guatemalan player to appear in five World Cup qualification processes (Juan Manuel Funes being the first) when he started in the second round of the 2018 World Cup qualification in their opening match against Bermuda.

On 6 September 2016, Ruiz scored 5 goals against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in his final farewell match for Guatemala. This gave him a total of 39 goals in 47 qualifying games and made him the highest goalscorer of all-time, from any country, in FIFA World Cup qualification history. Those 39 goals came against 14 different countries. They include five against each of Costa Rica, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Ruiz is the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the Guatemalan national team with 68 goals in 133 matches.

<text>Yuri Dmitrievich Budanov (; 24 November 196310 June 2011) was a Russian military officer convicted for the kidnapping and murder of Elza Kungayeva in Chechnya.

Budanov was highly controversial in Russia: despite the conviction, Budanov enjoyed widespread support of Russian households as polled by public opinion. At the same time, he was broadly hated in Chechnya, even by the pro-Russian Chechens. In December 2008, a court in the south Russian Ulyanovsk Oblast granted a petition for early release. After eight years in prison (of the ten years he was sentenced), he was released on parole on 15 January 2009.

On 10 June 2011, Budanov was shot dead in Moscow.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Budanov was born in 1963 in Khartsyzk, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Tank Military School in Kharkiv and went on officer career in the Soviet Army, particularly, serving with the Soviet base (Southern Group of Forces) in Hungary.

At the fall of the Soviet Union, Budanov was serving in Belarus, but he refused Belarusian citizenship and was transferred to the Siberian Military District, where he appears to have commanded the 160th Guards Tank Regiment of the 5th Guards Tank Division 1999–2001, and then to Chechnya. In 1999 Budanov graduated from the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy, receiving the rank of Guards Colonel.

===Chechen war===

As noted in his later murder trial by Dr. Stuart Turner, Royal College of Psychiatrists in London, Budanov participated in a military operation in the Argun River gorge in January 2000, where more than half of his regiment officers were killed, supposedly from sniper fire.

He was home for a leave in February 2000, where had talked about the killed officers in the Argun River gorge with his family, showed photographs of the fallen, looked nervous, depressive (from Stuart Turner expertise).

===Elza Kungaeva&#x27;s murder===
The father of Elza Kungayeva reported that Budanov had been encamped with his tank regiment outside the village of Tangi-Chu in the Urus-Martanovsky District district of the Chechen Republic since February 2000. He had gained a notorious reputation amongst villagers, having conducted arbitrary searches and looting of several homes ten days prior to the murder. Two days before the incident, he also reportedly looted and threatened to set fire to other homes.

On March 27, 2000, Russian forces stormed the Kungayev family home in Tangi-Chu. Budanov and three soldiers took Elza Kungayeva (who went by Kheda), the eldest daughter, out of the house and drove her away in an armored personnel carrier. Villagers then traveled to nearby Urus-Martan to search for her, and were told by a federal commander that Kungayeva had been raped and killed by drunken men.

From 2001 to 2003, Russian courts tried Budanov, charged with kidnapping, rape, and murder of Kungayeva. The rape allegation was later withdrawn by the prosecution despite the indication of an initial autopsy report. From the start, Budanov confessed to the slaying but denied the rape (which can be considered more dishonorable than murder in Chechen culture). He said he was interrogating Kungayeva in his tent, believing that she was a sniper who had been shooting at his troops, and killed her in a fit of rage when she insulted him.

==Prosecution==

===Arrest===
Budanov was arrested on 29 March 2000. According to press reports, Budanov claimed that Kungayeva was a suspected sniper, and that he had gone into a rage while questioning her.

Colonel-General Anatoly Kvashnin, then chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, appeared on national television to announce to President Vladimir Putin and the nation the arrest of Budanov in the grisly case. Kvashnin accused Budanov of &quot;humiliating&quot; and murdering Kungayeva, and denounced the colonel&#x27;s behavior as &quot;barbaric and &quot;disgraceful.&quot;

In a stark contrast, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Shamanov, who was Budanov&#x27;s commanding officer, exhibited strong sympathy towards him. He said that Budanov was one of his best commanders and offered this challenge: &quot;To [Budanov&#x27;s] enemies I say: Don&#x27;t put your paws on the image of a Russian soldier and officer.&quot;

The Chechen rebels offered to exchange nine recent OMON special police captives for Budanov. After the Russian side refused the offer, the prisoners were executed on the morning of 4 April 2000.

===Charges===
In relation to the case of Kungayeva, Budanov was charged with three crimes: kidnapping resulting in death, abuse of office accompanied by violence with serious consequences, and murder of an abductee. No charges have been brought expressly for the beating and torture Kungaeva endured prior to her death. He was also charged in the beating up of a subordinate officer, threatening superior officers with a weapon, and other crimes.

Budanov used his official position and a combat vehicle to remove Kungayeva from her home, and detained Kungayeva at a military installation; he was thus charged with exceeding his official position with violence resulting in serious consequences, which is punishable by three to ten years of imprisonment (article 286.3 of the criminal code).

===Lack of a rape prosecution===
The forensic physician, a Captain in the Russian military medical service, found three tears in her hymen and one in the mucous membrane of her rectum, and the report concludes that she was penetrated anally and vaginally by a blunt object before death.

Three of Budanov&#x27;s subordinates, Sergeants Li En Shou and Grigoriev and a Private Yegorev, were found responsible. Charges against all three were simultaneously brought and dropped under the 26 May 2000 amnesty law.

===Trial===
The trial began on 9 April 2003, in Rostov-on-Don. Legal proceedings against Budanov, who underwent several retrials, lasted a total of 2 years and 3 months.

Witnesses included Yahyayev, the person in the town administration, who according to Budanov had given him the picture representing Chechen snipers. However, Yahyayev said he had given no such picture to Budanov. General Shamanov came to defend Budanov during trial. He expressed his solidarity with the defendant, as did Colonel-General Gennady Troshev and numerous other Russian soldiers and civilians who picketed the court. According to a poll, 50% of the Russians asked supported the demands of picketers to release Colonel Budanov from custody; 19% did not support these demands.

In a controversial decision, Budanov was initially found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity on 31 December 2002, and committed to a psychiatric hospital for further evaluation and the length of the treatment would have been decided by his doctor.

However, in the beginning of March 2003 the supreme court invalidated the sentence and ordered a new trial. This took place in the same place but with a new judge. The sentence of 10 years of imprisonment was given on 25 July 2003.

The judge who convicted Budanov, Vladimir Bukreyev, himself was convicted of bribe-taking and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment on 6 July 2009.

==In prison and release==
On 21 September 2004, Shamanov, now the Ulyanovsk regional governor, signed a pardon for Budanov. Interfax quoted the head of the Ulyanovsk pardons commission, Anatoly Zherebtsov, as saying that if Putin backed the recommendation, Budanov would also get back his military rank and awards.

The commission&#x27;s decision sparked outrage in Chechnya. &quot;Whether in jail or freed, Budanov will remain a person who has committed a grave crime, which took the life of an innocent girl,&quot; Taus Dzhabrailov, the head of Chechnya&#x27;s parliament, told Interfax. Ramzan Kadyrov said: &quot;The Ulyanovsk commission&#x27;s decision is like spitting on the soul of the long-suffering Chechen people.&quot;

Kadyrov made statements that &quot;If any of Elza&#x27;s friends should meet [Budanov] I don&#x27;t want to predict how they will act. The Chechen people do not consider him to be a human being, and as a war criminal, he does not deserve to be. One might be able to forgive his crime to some extent if he had killed a man. But to sexually assault a girl cannot be forgiven. He is beneath contempt. He has brought shame on the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.&quot;

In February 2006, a Russian prison official announced that Budanov, who was serving his 10-year sentence, might be released early on good behaviour. The Chechen regional branch of the United Russia party addressed the State Duma and the Russian President with a request not to grant amnesty to Budanov. The same month Budanov was removed from the strict custody colony to a settlement-colony, on the petition of Budanov&#x27;s attorney, with account of good behaviour.

On 24 December 2008, a court granted him a release on parole. This was the fifth attempt by Budanov&#x27;s lawyers to obtain him a release on parole. Four applications before that were rejected. Victim&#x27;s lawyers appealed to overturn the decision (thus the delay in release), without success. Budanov was released on 15 January 2009, 15 months before completion of his conviction term. The decision was protested by Chechnya&#x27;s human rights ombudsman, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, who accused Russian judges of &quot;double standards&quot; with regard to Russians and Chechens.

The lawyer for the Kungayeva family, Stanislav Markelov, who had attempted a last-minute appeal against the release of Budanov, was shot dead in Moscow on 19 January 2009 along with Anastasia Baburova, a 25-year-old journalist for &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;.

==Assassination and funeral==
Yuri Budanov was assassinated around 11:30 on 10 June 2011 in central Moscow (Hamovniki, Komsomolski prospekt). Six silenced shots were fired, four of which struck Budanov in the head. The killer escaped in a car driven by an accomplice. The car was found partially burned several blocks away. A gun believed to be a Makarov PM was found with a silencer inside the car. Budanov&#x27;s wife witnessed the assassination and was held by Russian authorities. Russian police investigators commented that the attack was carefully planned and they considered blood revenge as one of the likely motives. One witness to the murder described the driver of the car from which the six shots were fired as being of Slavic appearance.

His funeral was attended by right-wing leaders such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky and included a three-gun salute. The Moscow police is reported to have made a dozen arrests, immediately before closing most of the investigation to the press.

On 7 May 2013, Yusup Temerkhanov was convicted by a jury of Budanov&#x27;s murder and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. According to investigation, Temerkhanov&#x27;s motive was revenge for his father, who was killed in 2000 during the Second Chechen War by Russian troops who refused to pay for their food in his restaurant. Temerkhanov&#x27;s defense lawyer, Murad Musayev, was charged with trying to bribe two jury members to find his client not guilty. The charges against Musayev were dropped in February 2015 due to statute of limitations.

Two jury members in question, Diana Lomonosova and Vitali Pronin, were charged with taking that bribe of 6,000,000 rubles. Pronin plead guilty to the charges during his trial. Lomonosova was amnestied on 28 April 2015 due to being older than 50. Pronin was sentenced to a suspended sentence of one year and immediately amnestied on 5 May 2015.

Temerkhanov denied any involvement and pleaded not guilty. He died while serving his sentence in a penal colony in Siberia in August 2018. Chechnya president Ramzan Kadyrov said that Mr Temerkhanov had been tried and imprisoned illegally due to anti-Chechen bias of Russian law enforcement.

<doc id="1004097" wikidata="Q3001563" url="?curid=1004097" title="Family reunion">
<text>A family reunion is an occasion when many members of an extended family congregate. Sometimes reunions are held regularly, for example on the same date of every year.

A typical family reunion will assemble for a meal, some recreation and discussion. The older attendees are generally grandparents, parents, siblings or first cousins while the youngest may be second, third or fourth cousins to each other, all other can be self-pollinating family members at fifth cousins. It is also not uncommon for regular family reunions to be sponsored by family organizations or family associations centered on a more distant common ancestor (often referred to as &quot;ancestral family organizations&quot;) or a commonly shared surname (&quot;single surname family organizations&quot;).

==Family reunion programs==
Family reunion programs are sponsored by Red Cross organizations. See the List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) leads the international movement, which has special responsibilities under international humanitarian law.

==Adoption reunion movements==
Many adults using an adoption reunion registry are able to locate parents and siblings. Adoption Reunion groups offer search and support guidance for birth parents and adoptees. Adoption Reunion organizations help to uphold adoptee rights and support adoption reform. According to TRIADOPTION® Library which kept records on adoption search and reunion beginning in the 1970s, Jean Paton formed Orphan Voyage back in 1954 and is considered the grandmother of the adoption reunion movement. ALMA (Adoptees Liberty Movement Association) was formed by Florence Fisher in New York City in 1972, ISRR (International Soundex Reunion Registry) in 1975, CUB (Concerned United Birthparents) in 1976, and dozens more sprung up around the US, Canada and Australia. By 1985 there were over 500 search and support organizations worldwide. The adoption reunion movement grew rapidly from grass roots local organizations coming together under forming the AAC (American Adoption Congress) in 1979 at a conference held in Washington, DC. Groups from each region were instrumental in finding ways to help their members reunite with their birth families and surrendered/relinquished children.

One of the early groups was Yesterday&#x27;s Children in Illinois founded by Donna Cullom. They were instrumental in filing the first class action suit in 1974 on behalf of adoptees having access to their original records and birth certificates. In Canada, Parent Finders was formed by Joan Vanstone. Philadelphia Forum, Adoptees In Search, Search Triad, Operation Identity and so many others held meetings, gave support, assisted in search and offered education in their communities. Like them WARM (Washington Adoption Reunion Movement) was a non-profit organization providing search, reunion and educational resources and support to the adult adoption community. WARM maintains a collection of Orphan memorials dedicated to adoptees and birthparents who died before being reunited.

==National and international family history societies==
Many reunions are made possible by family history societies. The Federation of Family History Societies (FFHS) is an international organisation based in the UK which represents, advises and supports over 220 family history societies. The Federation of East European Family History Societies (FEEFHS) was organized in 1992 as an umbrella organization that promotes family research. The Canadian Federation of Genealogical (CanFed) and Family History Societies work with Canadian born families.

==International family reunification==

Family reunification for third-country nationals remains a politically charged issue. The ICCPR (Art. 12.4) states openly the right of each person to enter the country of her nationality. This statement has been open to a variety of interpretations. Family reunification has become a controversial humanitarian and human rights issue as well as a much-debated immigration policy issue. In 2015 North Korea planned a programme of family reunion with South Korea.

==Genealogy societies==
The purpose of genealogical societies is to form a community of researchers and help its members create a library of families history resources.
FGS was founded in 1976 and represents the members of more than 600 genealogical societies. 
Organizations such as the African American Genealogical Society of Northern California assist family members to connect the branches of the family tree using genealogy and Internet resources.

==Traditional family reunion activities==

Traditional family reunion activities include an afternoon luncheon or early evening dinner and program featuring music, song, poetry reading, history recitals, honorary recognition of elders, community contributions and educational achievements.

Historic skits
Reenactments that highlight pivotal points in a family&#x27;s history. Participants are introduced to the art of developing a timeline as well as period research with a focus on costume design, customs, dialogue and social, economic and technological developments.

Story telling

Genealogy presentations

==Annual proclamations and observances==

Family Reunion Month
A Proclamation in 1985 To raise awareness of a growing trend of runaway children and newly formed organizations to help reunite families of runaways the US Congress, by House Joint Resolution 64, designated the period between Mother&#x27;s Day, May 12, and Father&#x27;s Day, June 16, 1985, as Family Reunion Month and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this period.

National Family Reunion Month
While some commercial enterprises have dubbed August as National Family Reunion Month many social groups including churches observe National Family Reunion Month in the month of July.

Annual Family Reunion Planning Month
A family awareness group with a focus on genealogy and traditional family reunion planning established Annual Family Reunion Planning Month in November.
Mark A. Askew, group Administrator and Founder, announced Family Reunion Planning Month to international reunion planners-group members, family magazines, corporations and schools. (See Fimark&#x27;s Family Reunion Planner Guidebook and Keepsake.)

<text>Roger Timothy Craig (born July 10, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Raiders and Minnesota Vikings. Craig went to four Pro Bowls and won three Super Bowls with the 49ers. Craig was the first NFL player to have 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season. Marshall Faulk and Christian McCaffrey are the only other players to have accomplished that feat. He currently works as the VP of Business Development at TIBCO Software.

==Early life==
Craig attended Central High School in Davenport, Iowa, graduating in 1979. There, he was teammates with future NFL TE Jamie Williams. His older brother, Curtis Craig, had also played running back, graduating from Central in 1974. The Craig brothers were preceded at running back for Central by future Denver Broncos RB Jim Jensen. The 1976 team, with Roger Craig and Williams, won the Iowa State Championship under Coach Jim Fox. In 1978, his Senior year, Craig rushed for 1,565 yards and 27 touchdowns, earning prep All-America honors. In his final high school game, a playoff loss, Craig rushed for 353 yards and 4 touchdowns.

Craig was an all-around athlete, also competing in wrestling and track. In wrestling, he was an Iowa State Championships qualifier. On the track, Craig finished 2nd in the Iowa State Track and Field Championships in both the 110 hurdles and the 400 hurdles as a Senior in 1979. Craig broke the school record in the 110 hurdles that had been set by Jim Jensen. Craig credited 10-time State Champion Coach Ira Dunsworth with helping develop his distinctive high knee running form. Craig&#x27;s time of 14.43 in the 110 hurdles is still listed among the All-Time Bests at the Iowa State Track and Field Championships.

==College career==
Craig followed in the footsteps of Curtis Craig and Jamie Williams to graduate from Davenport Central and then attend Nebraska to play for Coach Tom Osborne. Williams went on to an NFL career as well and Curtis Craig was an All-Big 8 Player in 1977.

Roger Craig played three full seasons for the University of Nebraska. In his Nebraska career, he rushed for 2,446 yards and 26 touchdowns, with an average of 6 yards per carry. He was an integral running back in Osborne&#x27;s I-formation option offense.

After playing mainly for the Freshman squad in 1979, Craig rushed for 769 yards (7.1) and 15 TDs as a Sophomore in 1980. As a Junior in 1981, Craig gained 1,060 yards on 173 carries (6.1) and six TDs. Craig was also fourth on the team with 12 receptions for 87 yards and was named to the All-Big 8 Team. In 1982, teaming with Mike Rozier in the backfield, Craig was injured early in the season and lost playing time while injured, but came back with 127-yards rushing in the regular-season final game.

Teammates of Craig during his tenure at Nebraska include QBs Jeff Quinn and Turner Gill; RBs Jarvis Redwine, I.M. Hipp, Andra Franklin, Craig Johnson, Jeff Smith and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier; T Dean Steinkuhler (#2 overall pick in 1984 NFL Draft); WR Irving Fryar (#1 overall pick in 1984 NFL Draft) and his hometown friend, TE Jamie Williams. Craig also ran one season of indoor track at Nebraska, finishing 4th in the 60 Meter hurdles at the Big 8 Indoor Championships.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers===
Craig was the 49th overall selection in the 1983 NFL draft, taken by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round from Nebraska, where he once held the record for longest run from scrimmage (94 yards, set during a 1981 game against Florida State University).

In his rookie year in 1983 playing under Bill Walsh and alongside Quarterback Joe Montana, Craig scored a combined 12 touchdowns rushing and receiving, as the 49ers reached the NFC Championship game. Montana, Craig and Walsh would remain together until the 1988 season. Craig first became well known in his rookie year for his distinctive high-knee running technique. He is featured in the Dire Straits &#x27;Walk of Life&#x27; video at the 3:13 mark.
In Super Bowl XIX in January 1985, Craig rushed for 58 yards, caught seven passes for 77 yards, and became the first player ever to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl during the 49ers&#x27; 38–16 victory over the Miami Dolphins.

The following season, Craig became the first in NFL history to run and receive for at least 1,000 yards in the same season. He ran for 1,050 yards on 214 carries and led the NFL with 92 catches for 1,016 yards, and scored a team high 15 touchdowns. With fullback Tom Rathman, also from Nebraska, the two formed the 49ers&#x27; &quot;Cornfield Backfield.&quot;

In 1988, Craig was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. He ran for a career-high 1,502 yards and caught an additional 76 passes for 534 yards. A memorable game occurred in week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. He scored three rushing touchdowns and ran a career-high 191 yards. He went on to assist the 49ers to Super Bowl XXIII by amassing 262 combined rushing and receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In the 49ers&#x27; 20–16 win over Cincinnati in that Super Bowl, he rushed for 71 yards and caught eight passes for 101 yards, making him the first running back have to have 100 receiving yards in a Super Bowl.

In the 1989 season, the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row, aided by Craig&#x27;s 1,527 combined rushing/receiving yards and seven touchdowns in the season, along with his 240 combined rushing/receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In San Francisco&#x27;s 55–10 win over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, Craig rushed for 69 yards, caught five passes for 34 yards, and scored a touchdown.

The 49ers were 14–2 in the following regular season on their quest to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. In the NFC Championship Game (his last as a 49er), a hit by Giants Nose Tackle Erik Howard caused Craig to fumble the football that was recovered by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor late in the fourth quarter while the 49ers were trying to hold on to a 13–12 lead over the New York Giants. Subsequent to the fumble recovery the Giants scored on a last-second field goal to win 15–13, and went on to win Super Bowl XXV.

In eight seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Craig played in 121 games and missed only seven games, five of them in his final season. Playing alongside Dwight Clark, Jerry Rice, Tom Rathman, Russ Francis and others in the 49ers diverse offense, Craig accounted for 11,506 yards from scrimmage, rushing for 7064 yards (4.2) and 50 touchdowns, and catching 508 passes for 4442 yards (8.7) and 16 touchdowns. In 16 playoff games with the 49ers, Craig had 817 yards rushing (4.0) with seven touchdowns and 63 receptions for 606 yards (9.7) and two touchdowns, as the 49ers won three Super Bowls.

===Los Angeles Raiders===
Craig left San Francisco and signed with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1991. Sharing time with Marcus Allen and Nick Bell, Craig led the Raiders in rushing as he rushed for 590 yards and had 17 receptions for 136 yards. The Raiders finished 9–7 under head coach Art Shell and lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs.

===Minnesota Vikings===
Craig played his final two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. Playing behind Terry Allen in 1992, Craig rushed for 416 yards and four touchdowns and caught 22 passes for 161 yards. The Vikings finished 11–5, winning the NFC Central Division and were defeated by the Washington Redskins in the playoffs.

In his final season, Craig split time with Barry Word, Scottie Graham and Robert Smith, as the Vikings finished 9–7, losing to the New York Giants in the playoffs. Craig rushed for 119 yards and 1 touchdown, catching 19 passes for 169 yards and 1 touchdown. Craig announced his retirement after the 1993 season, signing a one-day contract with the 49ers so he could retire as a 49er.

==NFL career statistics==

===Playoffs===
==Legacy==

Craig appeared in the NFL Playoffs every year of his career, and made the Pro Bowl four times (1985, 1987–1989). Craig finished his eleven NFL seasons with 8,189 rushing yards, 566 receptions for 4,911 receiving yards, and three kickoff returns for 43 yards. Overall, he amassed 13,143 total yards and scored 73 touchdowns (56 rushing and 17 receiving).

Craig was the first running back to gain more than 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season (1985). Since then, only two other running backs have achieved the same feat (Marshall Faulk in 1999, and Christian McCaffrey in 2019). Craig also caught a then-record 92 passes in the 1985 campaign. In 1988, Craig set a then-franchise record 1,502 yards rushing (Garrison Hearst broke the record with 1,570 yards in 1998. Frank Gore holds the current record with 1,695 yards in 2006). The 1988 season was the second time Craig broke the 2,000 combined yardage mark in his career.

Craig, Lydell Mitchell and Chuck Foreman are the only running backs to lead the NFL in receptions for a single season.

Craig is one of three running backs to ever record 100 receiving yards or more in a Super Bowl (James White, New England Patriots, Super Bowl 51; Corey Clement, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl 52). His prowess as a receiver out of the backfield is a contrast to his college career, where he caught only 16 passes during his three seasons at Nebraska.

In 1993, Peter King (in Inside the Helmet) reported that Craig was the only running back to be elected to the Pro Bowl at both fullback and halfback.

Despite his accomplishments as a football player, as of 2023, Craig has not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His inclusion (or lack thereof) has become a topic of controversy; while some cite Craig&#x27;s impressive statistics and records, others argue that his success was bolstered by the production of Hall of Fame teammates Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.

<text>Chamaecyparis obtusa (Japanese cypress, hinoki cypress or hinoki; or , ) is a species of cypress native to central Japan in East Asia, and widely cultivated in the temperate northern hemisphere for its high-quality timber and ornamental qualities, with many cultivars commercially available.

== Description ==
It is a slow-growing tree which may reach tall with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is dark red-brown. The leaves are scale-like, long, blunt tipped (obtuse), green above, and green below with a white stomatal band at the base of each scale-leaf. The cones are globose, in diameter, with 8–12 scales arranged in opposite pairs.

== Related species ==
The plant is widespread in Japan. The related &quot;Chamaecyparis pisifera&quot; (sawara cypress) can be readily distinguished in its having pointed tips to the leaves and smaller cones. A similar cypress found on Taiwan is treated by different botanists as either a variety of this species (as &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot; var. &quot;formosana&quot;) or as a separate species &quot;Chamaecyparis taiwanensis&quot;; it differs in having smaller cones (6–9 mm diameter) with smaller scales, and leaves with a more acute apex.

== Timber ==
It is grown for its very high-quality timber in Japan, where it is used as a material for building palaces, temples, shrines, traditional &quot;noh&quot; theatres, baths, table tennis blades and masu. The wood is lemon-scented, light pinkish-brown, with a rich, straight grain, and is highly rot-resistant. For example, Horyuji Temple and Osaka Castle are built from hinoki wood. The hinoki grown in Kiso, used for building Ise Shrine, are called 御神木 &quot;go-shin-boku&quot;, or &quot;divine trees&quot;.

== Ornamental cultivation ==
It is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and gardens, both in Japan and elsewhere in temperate climates, including western Europe and parts of North America. A large number of cultivars have been selected for garden planting, including dwarf forms, forms with yellow leaves, and forms with congested foliage. It is also often grown as bonsai.

=== Cultivars ===
Over 200 cultivars have been selected, varying in size from trees as large as the wild species, down to very slow-growing dwarf plants under high. A few of the best known are listed below. Those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).
* &#x27;Crippsii&#x27; makes a broad conic golden-green crown with a vigorous leading shoot, growing to or more tall
* &#x27;Fernspray Gold&#x27; – , arching sprays of green/yellow branches
* &#x27;Kamarachiba&#x27; – spreading shrub, tall by wide, sprays of yellow-green
* &#x27;Kosteri&#x27; – sprawling dwarf to tall by wide, with brilliant green foliage
* &#x27;Lycopodioides&#x27; reaches up to tall, with somewhat fasciated foliage.
* &#x27;Minima&#x27; – under after 20 years with mid-green foliage
* &#x27;Nana&#x27; – dark green, rounded dwarf shrub to 
* &#x27;Nana Aurea&#x27; – , golden tips to the fans and a bronze tone in winter
* &#x27;Nana Gracilis&#x27; – crowded fans of tiny branches producing richly textured effects; often cited as dwarf but has reached tall in cultivation in Britain
* &#x27;Nana Lutea&#x27; – compact, slow-growing, golden yellow selection which has become very popular; yellow counterpart to &#x27;Nana gracilis&#x27;
* &#x27;Spiralis&#x27; is an erect, stiff dwarf tree
* &#x27;Tempelhof&#x27; growing to with green-yellow foliage that turns bronze in winter
* &#x27;Tetragona Aurea&#x27; grows to around tall, with a narrow crown and irregular branching, the scale leaves in 4 equal ranks and branchlets tightly crowded, green and gold
* &#x27;Tsatsumi Gold&#x27; – , contorted branches, yellow-green foliage

== Chemistry ==
The lignans chamaecypanones A and B, obtulignolide, and isootobanone can be found in the heartwood of &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot; var. &quot;formosana&quot;. The biflavones sciadopitysin, ginkgetin, isoginkgetin, podocarpusflavone B, 7,7&quot;-&quot;O&quot;-dimethylamentoflavone, bilobetin, podocarpusflavone A, 7-&quot;O&quot;-methylamentoflavone, amentoflavone, hinokinin and hinokiflavone have been confirmed in the leaves of the plant. Chamaecydin was first discovered in the seeds of &quot;C. obtusa&quot;. The essential oil of &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot; contains a wide range of chemical compounds, including but not limited to the following: sabinene, elemol, myrcene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, eudesmols, α-terpinyl acetate, α-terpinolene, α-terpineol, 3-carene, α-pinene, γ-terpinene, camphene, bornyl acetate, 1-methyladamantane, cuminol, eucarvone, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, 3,4-dimethyl-, 1,3-dimethyl-1-cyclohexene, calamenene, τ-muurolol, borneol, α-cadinol, β-thujaplicin. Some of these compounds are fragrances or intermediates used in the fragrance industry. Thus, the &quot;C. obtusa&quot; essential oil is used in perfumery and personal care products, such as soaps, shampoos, cosmetics. Hinoki wood is used as a traditional Japanese stick incense for its light, earthy aroma.

Essential oil distilled from its wood is uniquely scented and highly valued.

== Pollen ==
Hinoki pollen can cause pollinosis, a specific type of allergic rhinitis. &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot;, along with &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; (sugi, Japanese cedar), is the leading source of allergic pollen in Japan and a major cause of hay fever in Japan.

<text>Amado Guevara (born 2 May 1976) is a Honduran former professional footballer and manager. He was the coach of Puerto Rico from 2018 to 2019.

A former midfielder, he is the second all-time cap leader for the Honduras national team seconded by Maynor Figueroa . He was selected as the Best Player of the 2001 Copa América, held in Colombia.

==Career==

===Club===
Guevara, nicknamed &quot;El Lobo&quot;, began his career in Honduras with Club Deportivo Olimpia and F.C. Motagua, and subsequently played all over the world: in Spain with Real Valladolid, in Mexico with Toros Neza and CD Zacatepec, and in Costa Rica with Deportivo Saprissa.

He was signed by the MetroStars of Major League Soccer on 11 April 2003, and immediately stepped in and produced. He finished the season with three goals and ten assists (he added another goal in the playoffs). Guevara added four key goals and two assists in the U.S. Open Cup, leading the MetroStars to the first final of any sort in the team&#x27;s history.

Guevara tallied ten goals (six on penalties) and ten assists in his second season. Guevara not only tied for the league lead in scoring, he was also named MLS&#x27;s MVP. In 2005, he produced another solid season for the Metros, with 11 goals and 11 assists, and added a goal in the playoffs.

In early 2006, a conflict arose between Guevara and the MetroStars. The club allowed him to train with F.C. Motagua, but Guevara played for the Honduran club in a number of friendly matches, which might or might not have been permitted. Guevara lashed out in the Honduran press at the Metros&#x27; GM Alexi Lalas, but the two patched things up and Guevara remained in New York for the 2006 season. He received his green card in March 2006, thus no longer counting as a foreign player in MLS. During the last game of the re-branded New York Red Bulls season, Guevara scored a hat trick helping them win 3–2 and reach the playoffs.

Following the 2006 season, Guevara was traded to Chivas USA in exchange for a designated player slot. After playing just four games for the club, Chivas USA coach Preki told MLSnet.com that &quot;I have a vision of where the club is going and [Guevara&#x27;s] not part of it.&quot; This comment came following consistently poor performance on the field and an incident in which Guevara was sent off for pushing an assistant referee. Attempts to deal the midfielder to Toronto FC, Colorado Rapids, FC Dallas, and Columbus Crew were all shot down by Guevara. Guevara then accepted a loan move to his former club F.C. Motagua for the remainder of the 2007 season. He quickly recovered the form that made him a star in the US top flight, leading the Honduran club to the Central American Club Championship Copa Interclubes UNCAF 2007 defeating regional and Costa Rican giant Saprissa 2–1 on aggregate on 5 December 2007.

On 9 April 2008, Guevara was traded to Toronto FC for a 2009 and 2010 draft pick. He made his debut for Toronto FC in his new team&#x27;s first win of the 2008 season, assisting Danny Dichio for the first goal of the game against the Los Angeles Galaxy. On 3 August 2008, Guevara was shown a straight red card by referee Baldomero Toledo after allegedly elbowing FC Dallas player Pablo Ricchetti in the face. The elbow drew blood, and Guevara was immediately thrown from the game. He received a 2-game suspension. While at TFC Guevara quickly became a fan favourite and was known for his darting runs, and spectacular free kicks. Guevara performed consistently well while in Toronto scoring a total of 9 goals over the course of the season, including 2 in the Canadian Championship. Guevara left Toronto to return to Honduran side F.C. Motagua in December 2009.

In the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League, Motagua was drawn against his former team, Toronto FC, in the preliminary round. Despite Guevara scoring two goals in the home leg, Motagua was eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.

In January 2013, &quot;el Lobo&quot; scored his 64th goal for Motagua, only 4 short of Óscar Hernández&#x27; 68 and 13 short of the club&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer Ángel Obando.

In 2014, Guevara signed with Honduran side Marathón. He retired in 2015.

===International===
He made his debut for Honduras in a May 1994 Miami Cup match against Peru and has earned a total of 138 caps, scoring 27 goals. He has represented his country in 49 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at 5 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 1998, 2000 and 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cups.

His final international was a June 2010 FIFA World Cup match against eventual winners Spain.

He was named the tournament MVP after leading Honduras to a surprise third-place finish in the 2001 Copa América. Honduras (a last minute call-up when Argentina dropped out a day before kickoff on 11 July 2001) arrived after the tournament started, just few hours before its first game with barely enough players. In the quarterfinal round, Honduras defeated Brazil (the favorite to win the tournament) by a score of 2–0. The defeat sent Brazil home and Honduras advanced to the semifinals.

Guevara helped lead Honduras through the qualification to the 2010 FIFA World Cup and captained the team at only their second appearance at a World Cup tournament.

===Manager===

On August 9, 2023 Carolina Core FC announced that he was the asset manager for Carolina Core FC for their first season in 2024.

<text>The 2004 MLS SuperDraft, held in Charlotte, North Carolina on January 16, 2004, was the fifth incarnation of the annual Major League Soccer SuperDraft. The draft was most notable at the time for the selection of one of the youngest athletes in American sporting history, Freddy Adu, with the first pick by D.C. United after a trade from the Dallas Burn. The trade was initiated by the league after Adu had signed in November 2003 with the intent of playing for D.C., his local team.

The draft also included Clint Dempsey (1st round), who later won MLS Rookie of the Year, and teenager Michael Bradley (4th round), the son of MetroStars coach Bob Bradley. Both players went on to earn over 120 caps with the U.S. national team and play overseas for European teams before returning to MLS.

<doc id="1004126" wikidata="Q270758" url="?curid=1004126" title="Olga Tañón">
<text>Olga Teresa Tañón Ortiz (born April 13, 1967) is a Puerto Rican singer. Over the course of her career, she has earned two Grammy Awards, three Latin Grammy Awards, and 29 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards. She has sold over 5 million copies of her albums.

==Early life==
Tañón is the youngest of four children born to José Tañón and Carmen Gloria Ortiz in the Santurce district of San Juan, Puerto Rico. She was raised in Levittown, located in the municipality of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, where she received her primary and secondary education.

==Career==
===Early career===
At the early age of 16 years old, Olga Tañón participated in a television talent show called &quot;Buscando Estrellas&quot; singing one of her own compositions. Her singing career began in the 1980s with &quot;Las Nenas de Ringo y Jossie&quot;, before joining the merengue group Chantelle, with which she achieved great success. When Tañón was a member of Chantelle, they scored their biggest hit, &quot;Queriendo y No&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1992, Tañón signed a contract with the WEA Latina record label to record a solo album. Her first recorded album was titled &quot;Sola&quot; (Alone) and included &quot;Me cambio por ella&quot; (I&#x27;ll Change Places With Her) and &quot;Quiero estar contigo&quot; (I Want To Be With You). In 1993, she recorded her second album for WEA Latina, &quot;Mujer de Fuego&quot; (Woman of Fire), which included the original Tañón composition &quot;Presencié tu Amor&quot; (I Witnessed Your Love). That year, Tañón received three Lo Nuestro Awards nominations in the Tropical/Salsa field: Album of the Year (&quot;Sola&quot;), Female Artist, and New Artist.

In 1994, Tañón earned her first double platinum record and in 1995, she earned 3 more platinum records with her album &quot;Siente el Amor&quot; (Feel the Love). This album also included another of her compositions, &quot;Unicornio&quot; (Unicorn), which was written to the rhythm of Salsa, and also included the hit &quot;Es Mentiroso&quot; (He&#x27;s a Liar).

Tañón recorded a Tex-Mex CD with Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solís, &quot;Nuevos Senderos&quot;, which opened her up to a new international market. With that recording, she became the first Puerto Rican musician to be certified by the RIAA to sell over half a million records; the lead single, the ballad &quot;Basta Ya!&quot; topped the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Tracks for several weeks and became Tañón&#x27;s first No. 1 on that chart. For the album, Tañón earned 3 Lo Nuestro Awards nominations for Pop Album of the Year, Pop Song of the Year and Pop Singer of the Year.

In 1997 Tañón debuted as an actress in the Puerto Rican version of the production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, produced by Rafo Muñiz. She played the part of Mary Magdalene. This version had a tropical feel to it and included some of Tañón&#x27;s songs. In 1998, Tañón married Juan González a Puerto Rican major-league baseball star. They had a daughter, Gabriella Marie, but divorced in 1999.

===2000s===
In 2000 Tañón, now known as the &quot;Woman of Fire&quot; or &quot;Mujer de Fuego&quot; by her fans, recorded her first concert, titled, &quot;&quot;Olga Viva...Viva Olga&quot; in the House of Blues in Orlando, Florida. This production was named by the National Foundation of Popular Culture as one of the year&#x27;s top 20 productions. The record went platinum and Tañón earned her first Grammy Award. In August 2000, Tañón sold out 12 shows in the Antonio Paoli Hall at the Luis A. Ferre Center of the Fine Arts in San Juan. Later that month she debuted in the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. Her performances received rave reviews in the &quot;Fort Worth Star Telegram&quot; and the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;. At the end of 2000, Tañón presented her musical spectacular at Panama&#x27;s Anayansi Theater and toured the southeastern United States with Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández.

In 2001, Tañón recorded a CD titled, &quot;Yo por Ti&quot; (Me for You), which won both American and Latin Grammys. The first single, &quot;Como Olvidar&quot;, topped the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Tracks. The CD became a best-seller in Puerto Rico, Latin America, and among the Hispanic population in the United States. &quot;Yo por Ti&quot;&quot; is Tañón&#x27;s only album that is not available on any streaming services.

In 2002, Tañón toured many countries, including Venezuela, Panama and the United States. That year she became the first merengue artist to successfully score a chart-topper in the Middle East when her partnership with Egyptian music singer Hakim yielded the highly successful Arabian hit, &quot;Ah Ya Albi&quot;. In 2003, Tañón toured Europe and made a total of ten recordings for WEA Latina. In 2003 she released &quot;Sobrevivir&quot; and won her fourth Grammy. She also married Billy Denizard, with whom she had two sons, Indiana Noa and Ian Nahir.

As part of an international tour called &quot;Evolution Tour 2008&quot;, Tañón traveled to Italy where she made a presentation at the &quot;Festival Latinoamericano&quot; on July 5, 2008. In 2005, Tañón released her hit album, &quot;Una Nueva Mujer&quot;, which won Best Contemporary Tropical Album at the 2006 Latin Grammys.

In support of Latin American immigrants in the U.S., in 2006 Tañón recorded, &quot;Nuestro Himno&quot; in collaboration with Pitbull, Carlos Ponce, and Wyclef Jean. On May 2, 2010, Tañón first performed in Iquitos a concert where she presented her classic songs. The concert was part of her tour, which started in Peru.

On February 22, 2007, Tañón won 3 awards at the 19th edition of Premio Lo Nuestro. During the 2006 show, she won in the categories: &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Female Artist&quot; and &quot;Song of the Year&quot;. She holds the record as the artist who has won the most &quot;Premio Lo Nuestro Awards&quot;, with a total of 29.

In June 2009, Tañón released a new hit single called &quot;Amor Entre Tres&quot; which is the theme song for the new soap opera in Venezuela called &quot;La Vida Entera.&quot; That month, WEA Latina released &quot;25 Exitos de Fuego Vol. 1 &amp; Vol. 2.&quot; Each CD has a set of greatest hits through her entire career of merengue and Latin pop. In September 2009 participated, next to Juanes and other artists, in &quot;Concierto por la Paz&quot; at Plaza de la Revolucion in La Habana, Cuba.

In 2011 the first of three Tañon albums was released on the Mia Musa Label: &quot;Ni Una Lagrima más’&quot;. In 2013 &quot;Una Mujer&quot; was released, and in 2017 &quot;Olga Tañon y Punto&quot;.

==Social activism==
After her participation in the Concert for Peace in Havana, in 2013, Tañón, a resident and voter of the state of Florida, increased her social activism profile by announcing on Univision TV network that she would participate in the April March 10 in Washington, DC supporting immigration reform and a path to citizenship and the right to vote, as well as announcing her support for the admission of her native Puerto Rico as the 51st state of the nation.

<doc id="1004128" wikidata="Q7228591" url="?curid=1004128" title="Drowning detection system">
<text>Drowning detection systems are systems designed to improve safety by reducing drowning deaths and injuries in public and private pools, waterparks, thermal baths, spa facilities, beaches, or other natural bodies of water smart beach.

==Classification==
Pool monitoring systems fall into two broad categories: Active or Passive. 
=== Active systems ===
Active systems are often using a wearable on the swimmer, such as a wristband, that monitors the behaviour and position of the swimmer. If the swimmer is detected to be under water för a certain period, an alarm is triggered and through acoustic underwater communication from the wristband to receivers installed in the pool the alarm is transferred to on-site lifeguards that immediately can identify which pool and to start rescue. The advantage of such systems is that each person is guarded and that the same wristband can be used for access to facilities and lockers. The system is mainly used in public swimming pools where lifeguards are present.

=== Passive systems ===
Passive systems provide lifeguards with views of swimmer activity and behaviour below the water surface, which aids the 10:20 scan for identifying potential incidents. They offer a way of compensating for surface glare and blind spots in the swimming pool, thereby making the lifeguard&#x27;s job easier.
Active systems are designed to automatically monitor the pool and alert lifeguards to potential incidents.

Passive system underwater cameras let lifeguards inspect multiple underwater views simultaneously from a single location. Cameras can cover areas which may otherwise be obstructed. Below water cameras can be paired with above water cameras to provide face-to-body matching if there is an incident where a swimmer needs to be identified, in cases of sexual assault for example.

<text>Killara () is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Killara is located north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. East Killara is a separate suburb and West Killara is a locality within Killara.

== History ==

The first Europeans to inhabit the area were convicts and their overseers, who set up a timber-getting camp around 1805, on the banks of the Lane Cove River. On 5 April 1821, five crown grants of land comprising Killara were given to settlers by Lachlan Macquarie, including 40 acres to Joseph Fidden. Killara Marian Street theatre has not been reopened.

Killara is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;permanent&quot; or &quot;always there&quot;. The name of the suburb was chosen when the railway line opened in 1899. James George Edwards was a representative of the people who requested a station be built here. The suburb was established as a &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s suburb&quot;, designed so that there would be no commercial ventures in the area. For this reason, the suburb has very few shops in the original development.

Killara Post Office opened on 7 November 1904.

Following World War I, Sydney experienced significant suburban expansion. Killara, previously a semi-rural area, began to develop more as a residential suburb during the interwar years. The suburb became gradually popular with middle and upper-middle-class families seeking a peaceful environment away from the bustling city. In the 1920s and 1930s, property development increased, as did the construction of grand homes in styles of Federation and California Bungalow, reflecting the growing affluence of the period. Killara&#x27;s picturesque setting, for its proximity to national parks and relatively large plots of land, made it a pleasant location for those seeking an affluent, suburban lifestyle.

Killara later became the home of the architect Harry Seidler, whose home—designed by him and his wife Penelope in the 1960s—can still be seen in Kalang Avenue. It is sometimes known as &quot;Killara House&quot; and sometimes as Harry and Penelope Seidler House. The couple moved into the house on Harry Seidler&#x27;s birthday in 1967. The garden contains a sculpture by the Los Angeles sculptor Eric Orr. The house is heritage-listed.

Marian Street Theatre played a significant role in the cultural life of the North Shore. The theatre is temporarily closed for renovation works.

== Heritage listings ==
Killara has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 13 Kalang Avenue: Harry and Penelope Seidler House
* 1 Werona Avenue: &quot;Woodlands&quot;, Killara

== Transport ==
Killara is home to a train station that connects to the T1 and T9 lines for routes to Berowra via Gordon, City via Gordon on the T1 or routes through North Shore via City on the T9.

The Pacific Highway is the main road thoroughfare through Killara.

CDC NSW operates two bus routes through Killara:

* 556: Lindfield to East Killara

* 565: Chatswood to Macquarie University via Roseville, Lindfield and Macquarie Park

== Development ==
The Swain Gardens were donated to Ku-ring-gai Council by Mr Swain, a Sydney bookseller, in the 1920s, and are today maintained by the council and volunteers. The gardens have been listed by the National Trust of Australia.

=== Schools ===
Killara is served by two public primary schools, Killara Public School and Beaumont Road Public School. The suburb is also home to Killara High School, one of the highest performing non-selective government secondary school in New South Wales. A short-lived private school in Killara, Abbotsholme College, counted two future prime ministers among its pupils.

Killara is also home to some child care centres, including Handprints Pre School and Child Care.

===Churches===
Churches in the suburb include St Martin&#x27;s Anglican Church and Killara Uniting Church (formerly Killara Congregational Church) on Karranga Avenue.

===Clubs===
Killara has recreational sport centres including Killara lawn tennis club and Killara golf club, which is ranked in the top 100 golf courses in Australia and picturesque views to the Blue Mountains has attracted golfers.

=== Commercial ===

Commercial developments are located along the Pacific Highway, including the Greengate Hotel, Beacon Lighting, Poolwerx, and Killara hotel. Residents usually travel to nearby suburbs of Gordon, Macquarie Park and Chatswood for regular shopping.

== Residential style ==
The majority of residential properties are built in the Federation and Californian Bungalow styles, although the suburb includes many other styles.

The Harry and Penelope Seidler House at 13 Kalang Avenue was designed by Harry and Penelope Seidler. The 1960s-era modern-design home, constructed with reinforced masonry walls, concrete floors and roof, rubble-stone retaining walls and fireplace, won the Wilkinson Award in 1967.

== Politics ==
For federal elections, Killara lies in the electorate of Bradfield, currently represented by Paul Fletcher. For state elections, Killara falls under the state electoral district of Davidson. The member for Davidson is Matt Cross. In terms of local government, Killara is part of the Ku-ring-gai municipal council.

<doc id="1004138" wikidata="Q296600" url="?curid=1004138" title="Arena (countermeasure)">
<text>Arena () is an active protection system (APS) developed at Russia&#x27;s Kolomna-based Engineering Design Bureau for the purpose of protecting armoured fighting vehicles from destruction by light anti-tank weapons, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), and flyover top attack missiles. It uses a Doppler radar to detect incoming warheads. Upon detection, a defensive rocket is fired that detonates near the inbound threat, destroying it before it hits the vehicle.

Arena is similar to Drozd, a Soviet active protection system from the late 1970s, which was installed on several T-55s during the Soviet–Afghan War. Drozd was followed by Shtora in the late 1980s, which used an electro-optical dazzlers or expendable so (smoke/IR smoke) to confuse the seeker head or defeat the user. In late 1994 the Russian Army deployed many armoured fighting vehicles to Chechnya, where they were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. The effectiveness of Chechen rocket-propelled grenades against Russian combat vehicles prompted the Kolomenskoye machine-building design bureau to devise the Arena active protection system in the early and mid-1990s. An export variant, Arena-E, was also developed. The system has been tested on the T-80UM-1, demonstrated at Omsk in 1997.

==Background==
The Soviet Union developed the first active protection system between 1977 and 1982, named Drozd (Russian: Дрозд). This system was designed as an alternative to passive or reactive armour, to defend against enemy anti-tank weapons. The system&#x27;s development was stimulated in large part by the introduction of new high-explosive anti-tank warheads. Drozd was designed to destroy these warheads before they hit the armour of a vehicle being attacked. It was composed of three main parts: two launcher arrays placed on either side of the gun turret and an auxiliary power unit located to the rear of the turret. The arrays were controlled by two millimeter-wave radar antennae. The system used a , cone-shaped fragmentation warhead. Drozd could protect a tank between the elevations of −6 and 20 degrees along the vertical plane, and between 40 and 60 degrees along the horizontal plane. Although reported to offer an 80% increase in survival rate during its testing in Afghanistan, the radar was unable to adequately detect threats and the firing of its rockets caused unacceptably high levels of collateral damage. About 250 Drozd systems were manufactured, all of which were installed on T-55s belonging to the Soviet Union&#x27;s naval infantry.

In the late 1980s, the Soviet Army began development of the Shtora-1 electro-optical jammer. It was first mounted on a T-80U in 1989, and later showcased on a T-72B (renamed T-72BU and later T-90). Shtora-1 is designed to jam incoming anti-tank missiles using a one-kilowatt infrared radiator. In 1995, it was fitted on a Ukrainian T-84. The Shtora-1 system consists of an infra-red radiator interface station, composed of the jammer, modulator and control panel, a number of forward-firing grenade discharges capable of producing a smoke screen, a laser warning receiver and a general control panel. Shtora offers 360 degree all-around protection, between the elevations of −5 and 25 degrees. The system is activated when the laser warning system alerts the tank commander, who responds by pressing a button on his control panel which automatically orients the turret towards the threat. This triggers the grenade launch, creating a smoke screen to reduce the ability of the missile to lock-on the vehicle. The jammers are designed to jam the infra-red seekers on the inbound missiles. According to the manufacturers, Shtora decreases the chances of a tank being hit by an anti-tank missile, such as the Dragon, by a factor of 4–5:1.

The large number of Russia&#x27;s casualties during the First Chechen War prompted Russia to consider the development of a new active protection system. During the Battle of Grozny, for example, the Russian Army lost between 200 and 250 armoured fighting vehicles to Chechen rebels. Vehicles which were knocked-out included main battle tanks such as the T-72 and T-80, and lighter armoured vehicles such as the BMP-2. The majority of tanks deployed to Chechnya were not issued with explosive reactive armour, due to the &quot;lack of time and funds&quot;, while some of those that were issued with reactive armour did not have the explosive charge to start the reaction. Some of the most dangerous threats to Russian armour were rocket-propelled grenades fired from buildings in Grozny. As a result of these vulnerabilities, Kolomenskoye developed the Arena active protection system, with the goal of providing Russian armour more reliable protection against these threats.

==System details==

The Arena system was primarily designed to defeat threats such as the rocket propelled grenade and the anti-tank missile, including newer anti-tank missiles with longer ranges. The active protection system can protect against missiles fired from both infantry carried rocket launchers and from helicopters, which attack the vehicle directly or by overflying it. Modern rocket propelled grenades can penetrate almost of steel armour, posing a serious threat to tanks operating in environments of asymmetric warfare. Therefore, increased tank protection requires either an increase in armour thickness and weight, or alternatively the use of an active protection system, like Arena.

The system uses a multi-function Doppler radar, which can be turned on and off by the tank commander. In conjunction with radar input, a digital computer scans an arc around the tank for threats, and evaluates which of the tank&#x27;s 26 quick-action projectiles it will release to intercept the incoming threat. In selecting the projectile to use for defeating the threat, the ballistic computer employs the information processed by the radar, including information such as flight parameters and velocity. On the T-80UM, the computer has a reaction time of 0.05 seconds and protects the tank over a 300-degree arc, everywhere but the rear side of the turret. On the T-72M1, Arena covers the frontal 260-degrees. Arena ordinarily covers an elevation from -85 degrees to +65 degrees. On the BMP-3M, the Arena-E covers the frontal 275 degrees from an elevation of -5 degrees to +15 degrees. The system engages targets within of the vehicle it is defending, and the ammunition detonates at around from the threat. It will engage any threat approaching the tank between the velocities of and , and can disregard false targets, such as outgoing projectiles, birds and small caliber bullets. If the computer detects that the projectile is heading towards an already discharged panel it can rotate the turret to point an active panel at the threat. Arena works during the day and night, and the lack of electromagnetic interference allows the system to be used by multiple vehicles as a team. The 27-volt system requires approximately one kilowatt of power, and weighs around . Arena increases a tank&#x27;s probability of surviving a rocket-propelled grenade by between 1.5–2 times.

Shtora was a soft-kill system, designed to passively defeat anti-tank missiles by jamming their guidance systems. By contrast, Arena is a hard-kill system like Drozd, designed to destroy the warhead through the use of munitions before the missile can engage the vehicle being protected.

==Arena-M==
The modernized Arena-M&#x27;s manufacturer claims it is able to intercept munitions coming from all aspects, including true top-attack missiles like the Javelin and that it will be installed on Russian T-80 and T-90 tanks.

In 2023, Russian state news agency &quot;RIA Novosti&quot; reported that Russia would soon equip its T-90M and T-80BVM tanks with Arena-M. The report also said that Russia was also exploring installing the system on T-72B3 and T-72B3M tanks.

==Development==

Arena evolved from the earlier Shater (Tent) active protection system first fitted to the Obiekt 478M. Arena was first fitted to the Obiekt 219E, a T-80B series experimental tank that later became known as the T80BM1. The existence of this program was revealed in 1992.

The Arena active protection system was first tested at the Kubinka proving grounds in early 1995, successfully defending a Russian tank against an anti-tank guided missile. A Russian T-80UM-1, with Arena, was first demonstrated to the public at Omsk in late 1997. Arena was also mounted on the BMP-3M modernization package, developed by the Kurganmashzavod Joint Stock Company, although the package has received no export orders.

Arena was to be fitted on the Russian Black Eagle which debuted in 1998. As of 2011, Arena had not entered quantity production.

== Exports ==
As of 1996, the German–French firm TDA was reported to have been involved in further developing Arena. In 1998, American defense contractor General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) proposed licensing Arena from KBM for sale to Turkey and the United States. For the Turkish Land Forces, GDLS sought to integrate Arena onto the M60-2000 and M1A2 Abrams. For the U.S. Army, GDLS proposed integrating Arena onto the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams tanks. As of 2000, Russia had agreed to the deal pending U.S. approval.

In 2011, Russia offered India the Arena system for use on the T-72. It is unknown whether India accepted any deliveries of Arena as of 2011.
An export variant, named Arena-E (Арена-Э), is available, costing an estimated $300,000. It weighs about . In 2007 South Korea and KBM Design Bureau reached an agreement to fit the Arena-E on the K2 main battle tank. The agreement was worth about .

<doc id="1004151" wikidata="Q974015" url="?curid=1004151" title="Indoor hockey">
<text>Indoor hockey is an indoor variant of field hockey. It is similar to the outdoor game in that two teams compete to move a hard ball into the goal of the opposing side using hockey sticks. Indoor hockey is played on a smaller area and between smaller teams than field hockey and the sidelines are replaced by solid barriers from which the ball rebounds and remains in play.

It is traditionally and mainly played as a pastime by outdoor field hockey players during the off-season or when conditions are unsuitable for outdoor play. Indoor hockey is played in regular national and international championships. The first Indoor Hockey World Cup was organized in 2003. It included countries which do not compete at the highest level of the outdoor game.

==Rules==
Indoor hockey differs from its outdoor parent in several ways:
* The pitch is smaller than the outdoor pitch. An indoor pitch is 18m to 22m wide by 36m to 44m long (similar to a handball or futsal pitch), divided by a center line. The shooting circle is a semicircle measured out 9m from each goal post. Side-boards mark the sidelines, helping to keep the ball on the pitch and allowing players to play against it. When the ball goes over the endline, the defensive team will restart play regardless of which team played the ball last. The pitch is made of wood or synthetic material. The board surface facing the playing surface is angled slightly to encourage ball to bounce down not up.
* The goals are smaller than in field hockey: 2m high by 3m wide and a minimum of 1m deep (this is the same size as handball goals as early indoor hockey used existing handball courts).
* A team consists of six players on the pitch, one of whom is a goalkeeper, with a maximum 12 players on a team.
* Internationally the game is divided into two 20-minute halves (in the German indoor league, they play 30 minute halves with the ability to call time outs as in basketball). Halftime break is 15 minutes. In case of a regulation tie teams play up to two 5-minute golden-goal overtimes; otherwise, the game will be decided by penalty strokes (5 rounds for each team followed by sudden-death rounds in case of ties thereafter).
* The players may not hit the ball, but only push it or deflect it, and may not raise the ball except in the shooting circle, with the purpose of scoring a goal.
* The balls and the sticks are similar, but players prefer lighter sticks than for the outdoor game.

==History==
Indoor hockey developed in Germany during the 1950s, quickly spreading to other European nations. Belgium was one of the countries to adopt the field hockey variant, and in 1966 René Frank, a native of Belgium, who was later to become President of the FIH, persuaded the German Hockey Associations to give responsibility over the rules of Indoor Hockey to the FIH. This led to the FIH recognising indoor hockey in its constitution in 1968.

Whereas in many countries field hockey is played all year long, in Germany, The Netherlands and Austria the hockey season is divided evenly into a field hockey half in summer and an indoor hockey season in winter.

The first FIH sanctioned tournament matches of Indoor Hockey were played in 1972.

==World Cup==
The International Hockey Federation organizes the Indoor Hockey World Cup. The first Indoor World Cup was held in Leipzig, Germany, in 2003, where the home nation won both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gold medals. Eurosport television ratings for the recent Indoor Hockey World Cup, held in Leipzig, Germany, have shown the event to garner large audiences. A total of 20 million viewers watched 13 hours broadcast on Eurosport, with ten matches aired live. Peak viewing audience reached 889,000 viewers during the opening Poland vs. USA match, with the average live viewing figure for the whole tournament at 601,000. Germany and Poland, Eurosport&#x27;s two strongest markets, showed particular interest, with more than 4 million different viewers tuning in from Germany, and more than 1.5 million watching from Poland. The average audience, calculated across several of Eurosport&#x27;s key territories, showed a strong bias towards young males according to Eurosport&#x27;s research. Arnaud Simon, Eurosport&#x27;s Program Director commented: &#x27;The first Indoor World Cup was a very exciting event, well suited for television and with good production standards. These characteristics were rewarded with very strong ratings, particularly considering that many of the matches were aired at off-peak viewing times.&#x27;

Els van Breda Vriesman, the President of the International Hockey Federation, added: &#x27;The figures speak for themselves, proving not only that hockey has mass appeal on television, but also that the target audience presents a very attractive commercial proposition for potential sponsors and advertisers.&#x27;

Germany defended their titles in Vienna, Austria, in February 2007. The German men were successful, although the women were beaten in the semi-final by Spain, who went on to lose the final against the Netherlands.

<text>Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique (English: My American Uncle or My Uncle from America) is a 1980 French film directed by Alain Resnais with a screenplay by Jean Gruault. The film juxtaposes a comedy-drama narrative with the ideas of Henri Laborit, the French surgeon, neurobiologist, philosopher and author. Its principal actors are Gérard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia, and Roger Pierre.

== Synopsis ==
Henri Laborit gives an introduction to the physiology of the brain, and also briefly describes his own background. Summary biographies of three fictional characters are given in parallel to his own: Jean Le Gall is born into a comfortable middle-class family on an island in the gulf of Morbihan in Brittany and pursues a career in radio and politics; Janine Garnier, daughter of left-wing working-class parents in Paris, runs away from home to become an actress, but later switches career to be a fashion adviser; René Ragueneau rebels against the old-fashioned outlook of his farming family in Torfou, in Maine-et-Loire, and studies accountancy before becoming an executive in a textile factory in Lille; a company merger forces him to take a new job in Cholet, away from his wife and children.

Laborit expounds his ideas on four main types of animal behaviour, grounded respectively in consumption, escape, struggle, and inhibition. The lives of the three fictional characters intersect at various points (Jean in an affair with Janine, René negotiating with Janine about the future of his job) and each of them faces moments of critical life-changing decision. At these moments they are seen as self-identifying with the image of a popular star in French cinema (Jean with Danielle Darrieux, Janine with Jean Marais, and René with Jean Gabin).
Laborit comments on the conflicts arising from pursuit of dominance among individuals and defensive reactions to it, and reflects on the need for better understanding of the human brain.

== Cast ==
* Gérard Depardieu as René Ragueneau
* Nicole Garcia as Janine Garnier
* Roger Pierre as Jean Le Gall
* Nelly Borgeaud as Arlette Le Gall
* Pierre Arditi as Zambeaux
* Gérard Darrieu as Léon Veestrate
* Philippe Laudenbach as Michel Aubert
* Marie Dubois as Thérèse Ragueneau
* Geneviève Mnich as René&#x27;s mother
* Henri Laborit as himself

==Development==
Resnais first met Laborit when the latter, an admirer of &quot;L&#x27;Année dernière à Marienbad&quot;, asked to work with him on a short documentary film for a pharmaceutical laboratory about a product to enhance the capacity of memory. That film was not financed, but the two men decided to explore the possibility of a feature film in which documentary would be mingled with fiction. Resnais began an extensive programme of immersing himself in Laborit&#x27;s published works, to understand how the presentation of scientific reasoning might interact with fictional narrative in a dramatically interesting way while treating each type of material independently. Resnais commented on his plan in an interview: &quot;Films or plays usually arise from a desire to develop an idea or theory through characters or through a story. I said to myself, &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t it be fun to do just the opposite? To allow theory and fiction to coexist on the screen.&#x27;&quot;

The screenwriter Jean Gruault developed the fictional strands, after reading all of Laborit&#x27;s works himself, and in continual discussions with Resnais. This led to a screenplay in which three fictional characters would take Laborit&#x27;s theories as their starting point but their interwoven stories would then develop in their own way. The process of writing the screenplay took one year.

Resnais also added the idea of using black-and-white extracts from old films to explore the way in which the characters might be influenced by models of behaviour embodied in certain well-known film actors, just as people sometimes admit to being influenced by books they have read or people they have met. Gruault made the choice of Danielle Darrieux, Jean Marais and Jean Gabin as the most likely ones to fit his three characters.

==Production==
Filming took place in Paris and on location at Cholet and the Îles Logoden in Morbihan, Brittany. The budget was not sufficient to allow extensive studio filming and so existing locations were used but often completely transformed (e.g. a bank became the broadcasting offices).

The fictional stories were filmed in advance and independently of Laborit&#x27;s contributions. At this stage Resnais did not know exactly what Laborit was going to say, although he had discussed with him the general themes which he would cover. Some very long shots were filmed in the stories to allow flexibility for Laborit&#x27;s words to be added later. The editor Albert Jurgenson commented that the role of the editing process in the film was more important than usual, and the various elements were so complex that everything could not be foreseen in the planning; the film was thoroughly rebuilt at the editing stage.

In the film&#x27;s epilogue a montage of travelling shots shows a landscape of abandoned and half-demolished buildings in the Bronx, New York, culminating on a starkly contrasted mural of a green tree painted on the side of one of the buildings, providing a moment of relief and pleasure. The camera then moves progressively closer to the mural in a series of shots, causing the whole image to disintegrate into its constituent parts until we can see only fragments of paint on the side of a single brick. Resnais explained that he wanted to show an image of the impossibility for the brain to understand things completely; the effort to create something and then an effort to destroy it were tendencies which seemed to fit the atmosphere of the film. The mural was &quot;The American Forest&quot; by the American artist and environmentalist Alan Sonfist.

==Reception==
When released in France the film achieved 1,378,207 admissions, and Resnais judged it to be one of the most popular films he had made. It was also one of his more successful films in the United States and it had a run of several months in New York.

The reception among press reviewers was mixed. In France critical observations included a view that the disparate elements of the film did not blend together satisfactorily or throw sufficient light upon each other, while there was also some concern expressed that the scientific arguments about the biological determinism of human actions and social phenomena were reactionary ideas which would give support to the politics of the &#x27;new right&#x27;.

In English-language reviews there was a similar range of reaction, from warm appreciation of a humorous and witty entertainment to sceptical dissatisfaction with its apparent didacticism and the lack of integration between science and fiction

===Interpretation===
One issue which has been repeatedly discussed in assessments of the film is the extent to which the fictional stories are intended to illustrate the scientific account outlined by Laborit and whether Resnais is sharing and endorsing his theories, as some reviews have readily assumed. Some accounts have gone further by representing Laborit&#x27;s remarks as comments on the behaviour of the three fictional characters in the stories. Elsewhere the view that Resnais and Laborit are expressing the same point of view has been challenged, and the case made that the structure of the film is a more complex arrangement of several component parts, of which Laborit&#x27;s commentary is one, which need to be examined in relation to each other.

Resnais discussed this question in several interviews after the film&#x27;s release and consistently made the point that while the film was deeply influenced by Laborit&#x27;s ideas, it was not a presentation of them, nor a critique. For example: &quot;... I didn&#x27;t want the characters simply to illustrate [Laborit&#x27;s ideas]. Nor did I conceive his role was to comment on the characters.&quot; &quot;It is a film which is permeated by Laborit, for sure, but it is certainly not a systematic illustration of Laborit...&quot; &quot;I am not a biologist nor a philosopher nor a sociologist ... it would be stupid to say that these theories are mine. All the same, I very much like the definition which Henri Laborit gives of the unconscious ... for him it is all of our habits of thought, all our automatic responses&quot;. &quot;We did not at any point seek to make his theories appear ridiculous. We have deep sympathy with Laborit. We did not want to offer a &#x27;digest&#x27; of his work, nor to popularise it. He acts on our film as a catalyst.&quot;

Resnais further explained that his intention was to open up an enquiry and a dialogue with the spectator: &quot;We produced the film upon a contradiction. We wanted it to be impregnated with the theses but to be independent of them as well. I think of it as a collage, with the fiction and the theses alongside each other; sometimes joining, sometimes diverging, sometimes even contradicting. The spectator is free to say that the characters are doing what Professor Laborit says, or that they are not doing what he says.&quot;

&quot;Each spectator should experience the film in their own way, bringing into play their own memories and their own associations. What I want to offer them with &quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot; are the elements - made as clear as possible - to allow them the freedom to construct the film as they prefer it, and to reconstruct themselves in the light of it. While being entertaining if possible.&quot;

Henri Laborit also spoke about the film in similar terms: &quot;In &quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot; my ideas are not there to explain the behaviour of characters to which they don&#x27;t directly apply, but they help to decode them.&quot; He also commented on his own reaction to the film&#x27;s presentation of his ideas: &quot;Perhaps it covers in a slightly simplistic way the problems of general pathology - the manner in which inhibitions and anguish lead to distress and illnesses - but I quite understand that it&#x27;s not dealing with a course of lectures! What I really like is the playful side of the film. At every moment you come up against something comic. And also cosmic.&quot;

==Accolades==
The film won the Grand Prix and the FIPRESCI prizes at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.

Jean Gruault&#x27;s screenplay was nominated at the 53rd Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay. 
At the French César awards in 1981 the film received six nominations, including Best Film and Best Director, but lost to François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Last Metro&quot; in both categories.

<text>Cobi N&#x27;Gai Jones (born June 16, 1970) is an American former professional soccer player and commentator. He is an analyst for MLS Season Pass on Apple TV. He has also been seen on Time Warner Cable SportsNet, Fox Sports, BeIN Sports, the Pac-12 Network, and as the host of the Totally Football Show: American Edition. In addition, during the 1990s, he hosted the health show &quot;Mega-Dose&quot; on MTV.

As a player, Jones was a midfielder from 1994 until 2007, starting his career in England with Premier League club Coventry City, before playing for Brazilian side Vasco da Gama. He is one of a significant group of United States national team stars who returned from overseas to aid the then new Major League Soccer in 1996, beginning an 11-year spell with the LA Galaxy. Jones is the all-time leader in caps for the United States national team and a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

Following retirement, Jones served as an assistant coach with the LA Galaxy for two seasons.

==Youth==
Jones grew up in Southern California. He played soccer with AYSO starting at age 5 in Westlake Village, California.
After graduating from Westlake High School, Jones emerged as a talented player in college, making the UCLA soccer team as a non-scholarship player, ultimately becoming one of its most successful soccer-playing graduates. While attending UCLA, Jones was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha, an international fraternity.

==Club career==
After playing in the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, Jones signed with English team Coventry City of the Premier League, where he spent one season. Jones trained with a German club 1. FC Köln of the Bundesliga before joining Brazilian club Vasco da Gama after impressive performances with the United States national team in the 1995 Copa America. After only a few months in Brazil, Jones signed with the new Los Angeles Galaxy franchise for Major League Soccer&#x27;s inaugural season.

Jones&#x27;s best year with the Galaxy came in 1998, when he was second in MLS with 51 points (19 goals and 13 assists), was named to the MLS Best XI, and was also named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year. In 2005, he became the last player in MLS to remain with his original team since 1996. Jones announced on March 19, 2007, that he would retire following the season.

==International career==
Jones is currently the all-time leader of the United States in appearances, with 164 caps as of the end of 2004 (scoring 15 goals). He played for the team in the 1994, 1998, and 2002 FIFA World Cups. He was named to the best XI at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup and won with the national team at the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He also represented his country at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. After playing in the 1995 Copa America, he also became a popular player in Latin America because the nickname used by an Argentine commentator to call him: &quot;Escobillón&quot; (&quot;swab&quot;), due to his bleached dreadlock hairstyle and the similar pronunciation of his name, Is Cobi Jones, and the word &quot;escobillón&quot;.

==Coaching career==
On November 9, 2007, Jones was announced as an assistant coach with the Galaxy under Ruud Gullit. After Gullit&#x27;s resignation on August 11, 2008, Jones served as the interim head coach until the Galaxy hired Jones&#x27;s former United States national team head coach Bruce Arena.

In January 2011, Jones left the Galaxy to serve as associate director of soccer with the New York Cosmos and was with the club through 2012.

==Personal life==
On September 12, 2009, Jones married Kim Reese. Reese, a music consultant and former music executive at New Line Cinema, met Jones in 2003 and began dating him in 2004. The couple was married at the Four Seasons Resort Aviara in Carlsbad, California. They have two sons, Cayden and Cai.

On March 11, 2011, Jones was selected for induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

Jones is a part of the ownership group of Angel City FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League.

<text>Helen Phyllis Shipman (February 5, 1899 – April 13, 1984) was an American singer, dancer and actress who starred in various Broadway musicals, in musical comedies in vaudeville, and in films.

==Early life and career==
Shipman was the daughter of William H. Shipman, a printer. She had a sister who was married to a &quot;wealthy New York oil man.&quot;

Shipman began performing at the age of three doing impressions of famous adult stars in the entertainment business. Her first professional job was as &quot;Baby Phyllis&quot; at the Duquesne Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1908, she toured on the B. F. Keith show circuit in a play titled &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. After that tour, she moved with her mother and older sister to New York City to advance her career, however, she continued to tour on the Keith circuit. 

Between tours, she worked in variety shows at the Palace Theatre in New York City, where she sang songs composed for her by lyricist, Neville Fleeson. It was in these shows that she got to know other entertainers such as Jimmy Durante and the Marx Brothers. She was childhood friends with Ira and George Gershwin. 

In 1915, Shipman was invited by Florenz Ziegfeld to co-star in his new &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot; production on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. She had her first starring role on Broadway in the musical &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; in 1917, and followed that with another Broadway musical comedy, &quot;Oh Lady! Lady!&quot; 

She then took the 1919 Broadway musical, &quot;Irene&quot;, on tour playing the title role and introducing the song &quot;Alice Blue Gown&quot; to audiences in places like Cleveland and Chicago. Her longest running Broadway play was &quot;The Lady In Ermine&quot; which ran for 232 performances at the Ambassador Theatre in 1922. She starred in many other Broadway plays. 

She also performed in at least 14 movies including &quot;Christopher Bean&quot; (1933) with Beulah Bondi and Marie Dressler, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1935) with Nelson Eddy and Frank Morgan, &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936) with Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald, and &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1936) with Robert Taylor and James Stewart. She expressed (to her sister) hopes of playing the role of Hannah in the upcoming movie titled &quot;White Banners&quot; (1938) but lost the part to actress Fay Bainter.

==Later life==
Shipman married the Broadway, movie, and radio actor Edward Pawley while he was in Hollywood performing in movies. Pawley had been a star on Broadway and was the first actor to portray Sinclair Lewis&#x27; Elmer Gantry character on the Broadway stage in 1928. Shipman effectively quit show business after their marriage and focused more attention on her other interests, such as gardening, the arts, reading and music. She was an active member of the fraternal order known as the Rosicrucians. 

In 1951, when her husband left his starring role as &#x27;Steve Wilson&#x27; on the very popular radio show, &quot;Big Town&quot;, they retired to Rappahannock County, Virginia. She died there of heart failure on April 13, 1984, at the age of 85. She did not have any children. 

Helen Shipman has sometimes been confused with Helena Shipman who was born in the State of Washington and who married actor Robert Keith and had a son, Brian Keith, who became a famous actor in the movies and on TV. Helena Shipman was also a stage actress for a while, but never achieved the fame which Helen Shipman attained.

<text>Dmitry Nikolayevich Anuchin (Russian: Дми́трий Никола́евич Ану́чин; 27 August 1843 – 4 June 1923) was a Russian anthropologist, ethnographist, archaeologist, and geographer. He was a member of the Russian Geographical Society and convened the ethnographic sub-section of the 12th Congress of Russian Natural Scientists and Physicians(XII съезда русских естествоиспытателей и врачей) held in Moscow in 1909. Here he pushed for the professionalisation of ethnography as compared to missionaries and amateurs. However he opposed Lev Sternberg&#x27;s call for the establishment of an imperial bureau of ethnography, fearing that the discipline would become too tied up with the Tsarist bureaucracy.

However, in 1915 he did become involved with the Commission for the Study of the Natural Productive Forces (KEPS) which assisted in the wartime mobilisation of resources in the Russian Empire. He argued for a second government-sponsored commission to study the population along the lines of the American Bureau of Ethnology. The Russian Academy of Sciences dismissed his proposal as unrealisable, but did establish within KEPS a Committee for the Description of Russia by Region. This turn around has been explained as arising from the situation when there was little scope for ethnographers to do independent research as many had been drafted into military hospitals and similar institutions to help with the war effort.

The crater Anuchin on the Moon, Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at Moscow State University, a glacier in Novaya Zemlya, one of the Kuril Islands and a mountain in Ural are named after him.

<doc id="1004186" wikidata="Q62981497" url="?curid=1004186" title="Aversives">
<text>In psychology, aversives are unpleasant stimuli that induce changes in behavior via negative reinforcement or positive punishment. By applying an aversive immediately before or after a behavior, the likelihood of the target behavior occurring in the future may be reduced. Aversives can vary from being slightly unpleasant or irritating to physically, psychologically and/or emotionally damaging.

==Types of stimuli==

There are two types of aversive stimuli:

===Unconditioned===
Unconditioned aversive stimuli naturally result in pain or discomfort and are often associated with biologically harmful or damaging substances or events. Examples include extreme heat or cold, bitter flavors, electric shocks, loud noises and pain. Aversives can be applied naturally (such as touching a hot stove) or in a contrived manner (such as during torture or behavior modification).

===Conditioned===
A conditioned aversive stimulus is an initially neutral stimulus that becomes aversive after repeated pairing with an unconditioned aversive stimulus. This type of stimulus would include consequences such as verbal warnings, gestures or even the sight of an individual who is disliked.

==Use in applied behavior analysis (ABA)==
Aversives may be used as punishment or negative reinforcement during applied behavior analysis. In early years, the use of aversives was represented as a less restrictive alternative to the methods used in mental institutions such as shock treatment, hydrotherapy, straitjacketing and frontal lobotomies. Early iterations of the Lovaas technique incorporated aversives, though Lovaas later abandoned their use. Over time the use of aversives has become less common, though they are still in use as of 2021.

Several national and international disability rights groups have spoken against the use of aversive therapies, including TASH and the Autism National Committee (known as AUTCOM). Although it has generally fallen out of favor, at least one institution continues to use electric shocks on the skin as an aversive. A ruling in 2018 supported its continued use. The FDA has made a commitment to ban its use, but as of January 2019 has not yet done so.

A report from the Food and Drug Administration found that &quot;the literature contains reports that when health care providers have resorted to punishers... the addition of punishers proved no more successful than [Positive behavioral support]-only techniques... Reflecting this trend, a 2008 survey of members of the Association for Behavior Analysis found that providers generally view punishment procedures as having more negative side effects and being less successful than reinforcement procedures.&quot; The Behavior Analyst Certification Board has stated their support the use of aversives on children with consent by a parent or guardian.

=== Opposition ===
The use of aversives in applied behavior analysis is opposed by many advocacy groups for people with disabilities. These include:

* Autistic Self Advocacy Network
* Arc of the United States
* Aspies For Freedom
* Autism Network International

<doc id="1004187" wikidata="Q19509" url="?curid=1004187" title="Stade Rennais FC">
<text>Stade Rennais Football Club (SRFC, ), commonly referred to as Stade Rennais () or simply Rennes, is a French professional football club based in Rennes, Brittany. It competes in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football, and plays its home matches at the Roazhon Park. The team&#x27;s president is Olivier Cloarec, and its owner is Artémis, the holding company of businessman François Pinault.

Rennes was founded in 1901 under the name Stade Rennais and is one of the founding members of the first division of French football. Alongside Nantes, Rennes is one of the top football clubs in the region and the two are among the main clubs that contest the Derby Breton. The club&#x27;s best finish in the league has been third, accomplishing this feat after the season was ended prematurely in 2019–20. Rennes has won three Coupe de France titles in 1965, 1971 and 2019. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version, but the club&#x27;s home colours have been the same since its inception, which are red, black, and white.

Rennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the Henri Guérin Training Centre, which was formed in 2000. In 2010, the French Football Federation (FFF) recognised Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country. The cornerstone of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the Coupe Gambardella three times in 1973, 2003 and 2008. The academy has produced several notable talents, such as Ousmane Dembélé, Yacine Brahimi, Eduardo Camavinga, Yoann Gourcuff, Yann M&#x27;Vila, Moussa Sow, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Sylvain Wiltord, Jimmy Briand, Désiré Doué and Mathys Tel.

== History ==


Stade Rennais Football Club was founded on 10 March 1901 by a group of former students living in Brittany. Football had quickly become widely circulated in nearby regions and it was soon brought to Brittany. The club&#x27;s first match was played two weeks later against FC Rennais, which Stade lost 6–0.

In 1902, Stade Rennais joined the USFSA federation and, subsequently, became a founding member of the Ligue de Bretagne de football, a newly created regional league founded by the federation. In the second league season, the club won the competition after defeating the inaugural league winners FC Rennais 4–0 in the final.

On 4 May 1904, Stade Rennais merged with its rivals FC Rennais to form Stade Rennais Université Club, with the primary objective being to overcome the recent domination of the Ligue de Bretagne by US Saint-Malo, then known as US Saint-Servan, which fielded mostly British players. The new club adopted the colours of Rennais, which consisted of a red and black combination with black vertical stripes on the shirt. After three years of Saint-Malo dominating the league, Rennes finally eclipsed the club in 1908 under the leadership of Welsh manager Arthur Griffith. In the following season, Rennes won the league again, but in 1910 Rennes was unable to win a third, as Saint-Malo won the league by two points. The champions subsequently went on an impressive run in which it won the league for the next four seasons over.

After World War I, Rennes began focusing its efforts on winning the recently created Coupe de France. Strengthened by the arrivals of internationals Bernard Lenoble, Maurice Gastiger, Ernest Molles and captain François Hugues after the war, in the competition&#x27;s fourth campaign, Rennes reached the final. In the match, the club faced two-time defending champions Red Star Olympique, which was led by attacker Paul Nicolas, defender Lucien Gamblin and goalkeeper Pierre Chayriguès. Red Star opened the scoring in the fourth minute and the match was concluded following a late goal from Raymond Sentubéry. After the disorganisation of the USFSA in 1913, Rennes joined the Ligue de l&#x27;Ouest. In 1929, Rennes departed the league after disagreeing with the increased number of games the league sought to implement in the new season. The departure led to Rennes becoming a &quot;free agent&quot;, and the club played numerous friendly matches to compensate for the loss of league matches.

In July 1930, the National Council of the French Football Federation (FFF) voted 128–20 in support of professionalism in French football. Under the leadership of club president Isidore Odorico, Rennes was among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and became founding members of the new league. In the league&#x27;s inaugural season, Rennes finished mid-table in its group. Two years later, in 1935, the club reached the Coupe de France final for the second time. Rennes, however, lost to Marseille 3–0 after failing to overcome three first-half goals. The club&#x27;s attack was also limited in the match due to being deprived of its top two attackers, Walter Kaiser and Walter Vollweiler, who were both injured. Rennes spent four more years in the first division before suffering relegation to Division 2 in the 1936–37 season. Rennes played in Division 2 before professionalism was abolished due to World War II. After the war, Rennes returned to Division 1. Led by the Austrian-born Frenchman Franz Pleyer, Rennes achieved its best finish in the league after finishing fourth in the 1948–49 campaign. Despite the domestic resurgence under Pleyer, the club struggled to maintain consistency and, in the 1950s, rotated between the first division and the second division under the watch of the Spaniard Salvador Artigas and Henri Guérin, who acted in a player-coach role.

Under the leadership of new president Louis Girard, Rennes underwent a major upheaval, which included renovations to the stadium. Girard sought to make Rennes competitive nationally and the first objective was achieved when the club earned promotion back to Division 1 in 1958. After finishing in the bottom-half of the table for six-straight seasons, Rennes, now managed by former club player Jean Prouff, finished in fourth place in the 1964–65 season. In the same season, the club earned its first major honour after winning the Coupe de France. Rennes, led by players such as Daniel Rodighiéro, Georges Lamia and Jean-Claude Lavaud defeated UA Sedan-Torcy 3–1 in the replay of the final. The first leg of the match ended 2–2, which resulted in a replay. After the cup success, Rennes played in European competition for the first time in the 1965–66 season, participating in the European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup. The club, however, lost to Czechoslovakian club Dukla Prague in the first round.

In the ensuing years, Rennes struggled in league play but performed well in the Coupe de France, reaching the semi-finals on two occasions in 1967 and 1970. In 1971, Rennes captured its second Coupe de France title after defeating Lyon 1–0 in the final, with the only goal coming from the penalty spot scored by André Guy.

On 23 May 1972, Rennes officially changed its name to its current form, Stade Rennais Football Club. After another season in charge, Prouff departed Rennes and the club entered free-fall. From 1972 to 1994, Rennes was supervised by 11 different managers and, during the years, constantly hovered between Division 1 and Division 2. In 1978, the club was on the verge of bankruptcy and, as a result, was ordered by a tribunal to sell its biggest earners and enter a policy of austerity. In the 1980s, the city&#x27;s municipality gained a majority stake in the club.

In 1994, Rennes returned to Division 1 and entered a period of stability mainly due to the utilisation of the club&#x27;s youth academy. Instead of entering bidding wars for players, Rennes groomed its youngsters and inserted them onto the senior team when coaches felt they were ready. This strategy proved successful with players such as Sylvain Wiltord, Jocelyn Gourvennec, and Ulrich Le Pen. In 1998, the club was sold by the municipality to retail magnate François Pinault. Pinault invested a substantial amount of funding into the club and sought to increase Rennes&#x27; production of youth talent by constructing a training centre, which was completed in 2000. Pinault also paid for a completed re-construction of the stadium and also invested in the transfer market, recruiting several players from South America, most notably Brazilian forward Lucas Severino, whom Rennes paid a record €21 million for in 2000.

The results were immediate in the decade from 2000 to 2010, with Rennes appearing in UEFA-sanctioned European competitions in five of the ten seasons. In youth production, the club produced several youth talents such as Yann M&#x27;Vila, Yacine Brahimi, Jimmy Briand and Abdoulaye Diallo, among others. In league competition, Rennes tied its best finish ever in the league by finishing fourth in 2004–05. Two seasons later, the club accomplished this feat again. In 2009, Rennes reached the Coupe de France final for the fourth time in its history. In the final, Rennes faced Breton rival Guingamp and was the heavy favourite. Despite taking the lead in the second half, however, Rennes was defeated 2–1 after Guingamp scored two goals in a ten-minute span. In 2014, Rennes made the Coupe de France final and once again their opponent was Guingamp. In a tense final, Rennes lost the match to their fierce rivals 2–0. In the 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, Rennes had one of their best campaigns in recent memory, finishing 5th and qualifying to the UEFA Europa League for the 2018–19 season.

In the following season, the 2018–19 season, Rennes had irregular form in the league, finishing tenth, but claimed its third Coupe de France win on 27 April, rallying back from two goals down to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6–5 on penalties in the final. The French Cup winners for the last four years were heavy favourites to beat Rennes having already been crowned Ligue 1 champions for the 2018–19 season on 21 April. The club also had a great Europa League campaign, where they reached the round of 16 after finishing second in the group stage. In the round of 32, they beat Real Betis 6–4 on aggregate, and in the round of 16, they were matched up with Arsenal. In the first leg on 7 March, Rennes recorded a historic 3–1 victory at home. In the second leg however, eventual finalists Arsenal won 3–0 in London and eliminated the French club.

In the 2019–20 season, Rennes finished third in Ligue 1 and qualified for 2020–21 UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.

== Stadium ==


Rennes has played on the land where the club&#x27;s stadium, the Roazhon Park, situates itself since 1912. The Roazhon Park, then named Stade de Route de Lorient, which is its address, was constructed in 1912. The facility was inaugurated on 15 September 1912 in a match between Rennes and SA du Lycée de Rennes. The Stade de la Route de Lorient was officially inaugurated a month later when Rennes took on Racing Club de France in front of 3,000 spectators.

The Roazhon Park is owned by the city of Rennes and has undergone renovations three times, in 1955, 1983 and 1999. In 1983, the club renovated the stadium in an attempt to resemble the Olympiastadion in Munich. After nearly four years of renovation, the new stadium was unveiled on 7 March 1987. In 1999, the new renovations, which were designed by architect Bruno Gaudin, cost €37.3 million and took four years to complete. The stadium&#x27;s inauguration was celebrated twice: in a match between France and Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 2004, and another football match contesting by Rennes and Metz two months later. The current capacity of the stadium is 29,778.

=== Training centre ===

The Centre d&#x27;entraînement Henri-Guérin (Henri-Guérin Training Center), colloquially known as &quot;La Piverdière&quot;, was inaugurated in June 2000. Named for former club player and manager Henri Guérin, &quot;La Piverdière&quot; is located on the outskirts of Rennes just southwest of Roazhon Park. The centre hosts the senior team&#x27;s training sessions, as well as the club&#x27;s reserve and youth teams. In 2007, &quot;La Piverdière&quot; became the home of the club&#x27;s administrative and business headquarters.

Since its inception, &quot;La Piverdière&quot; has become reputed for its consistent production of youth talent, bringing through players that have become household names at the international level. In that time, the club&#x27;s youth system has made up most of the club&#x27;s first team. Current first-team players Eduardo Camavinga and Joris Gnagnon were graduates of the academy. Rennes has been awarded the honour of having the best youth academy in France.

Rennes has won the Coupe Gambardella, the under-19 national youth competition, three times, in 1973, 2003 and 2008. In 2003, the team that won was anchored by Yoann Gourcuff and Marveaux. Gourcuff went on to win both the UNFP Player of the Year and French Player of the Year awards and established himself as a French international. Marveaux graduated from the academy after the Gambardella triumph and went on to appear in over 100 matches for Rennes. He had his best season in the 2009–10 season, appearing in 38 matches and scoring 12 goals. In 2008, the team that won the competition was composed of Brahimi, M&#x27;Vila, Souprayen, Yohann Lasimant, Quentin Rouger, Kévin Théophile-Catherine, and Damien Le Tallec. Six of the seven players made appearances with the first-team. Le Tallec moved to German club Borussia Dortmund before he could make an appearance.

== Supporters ==
Rennes have several supporter groups associated with the club, ranging from groups of senior supporters to &quot;ultras&quot;. The oldest, most structured and frequented is Allez Rennes. The group was founded in 1962 and together with &quot;Les Socios&quot;, founded in 1992, is the largest group of traditional supporters.

The section of the stadium popularly called &quot;Tribune Mordelles&quot; is occupied by the Roazhon Celtic Kop (RCK). Although the group was founded in 1991, its roots date back to 1987 when a group of supporters known as Ultras Roazhon was formed. The RCK was formed by three young supporters who decided to establish the Mordelles stand as the true hot spot of the stadium. The group marks its presence not only through continuous singing and the use of flares, but also through numerous tifos and choreographic celebrations. The Breton identity is regularly displayed and the use of Celtic symbols is frequent. A special feat of the RCK is that the group is responsible for having made the largest Gwenn-ha-du in history measuring 270 square metres. It was displayed at the Mordelles stand during the 1994–95 season.

The RCK functions as an unconditional supporters&#x27; group present at all matches, including those at European level, and gathers supporters mainly of the &quot;ultra&quot;-mentality, but also holds on to its values describe by the group as &quot;Amitié, Respect et Fête&quot; (&quot;Friendship, Respect and Party&quot;). The Kop keeps an open attitude towards those supporters of Rennes who share them. The group has taken a strong position against &quot;football business&quot;, the suppression of the &quot;ultra&quot;-movement and racism. Although the group is not officially political, it regularly manifests anti-fascism. The RCK is a member of the RSRA (Réseau Supporter de Résistance Antiraciste), a French network of football supporter groups against racism, and involved in Fare, a European network of football supporter groups against racism and discrimination.

Another major supporter group of the club is the Section Roazhon Pariz. It is a section of the RCK that is situated in Paris. The group supports the team at important away matches, such as those against Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain. The RCK makes no attempt to hide its chaotic and festive appearance. In 2003, a second group of ultras, the Breizh Stourmer (&quot;Breton Warriors&quot;) was formed through a break with the RCK. The group was created around the idea of a small, strong core of supporters and chose to situate themselves on the opposite side of the RCK. The Breizh Stourmer has been accused by elements of the RCK for certain members holding extreme-right views. Violent clashes between radical members of the two groups have occurred. The main rival of the RCK has, however, not been the Breizh Stourmer, but for many years, the Brigade Loire, a supporters&#x27; group of Rennes&#x27; rival club Nantes. The Breizh Stourmer has since dissolved. In 2008, a new group of supporters, the Unvez Kelt (UK) (&quot;Celtic Unity&quot;), was founded. The group was initially refused by the club as an official group, however, with the help of Les Socios, it was finally accepted. Failing to establish itself and after several problems, among them a fire that destroyed its premises in November 2010, clashes with the National Police and incidents resulting in several of its members becoming arrested during an away match at Auxerre in 2012, the Unvez Kelt decided to dissolve in 2012.

<doc id="1004227" wikidata="Q3586945" url="?curid=1004227" title="List of Nunavut general elections">
<text>The Canadian territory of Nunavut holds general elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. Nunavut was created 1 April 1999 from part of the Northwest Territories, and its first election was held prior to division on 15 February 1999. Since the adoption of a fixed election date law in 2014, general elections in Nunavut are held on the last Monday of October in the fourth calendar year following the last elections.

Nunavut is divided into nineteen constituencies, each electing one &quot;Member of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (MLA). The number of constituencies has remained unchanged since the first general election. Nunavut uses consensus government in which there are no political parties. The Premier of Nunavut (and the cabinet) is directly elected by the MLAs, unlike most other provincial or territorial premiers, who are officially appointed by a Lieutenant-Governor or Commissioner on account of their leadership of a majority bloc in the legislature.

In the electoral district of Akulliq, the 2008 election was delayed because of a legal battle that was brought forth by the former Member of Parliament Jack Anawak. Anawak filed as a candidate in the 2008 election but his application was rejected by Elections Nunavut because he had not lived in the territory for twelve consecutive months prior to the election. After Anawak&#x27;s case was dismissed by the courts, a by-election was held on December 15, 2008. During the 2008 election, only two votes separated incumbent MLA Steve Mapsalak and his main challenger, former Northwest Territories MLA John Ningark. As a result, a judicial recount was conducted, however this resulted in Ningark and Mapsalak each receiving exactly 157 votes, meaning that the election resulted in a tie. A second election took place three months later on March 2, 2009. During the second election, John Ningark beat out his opponent Steve Mapsalak 193 votes to 179. The 2008 election was also unusual in that one electoral district, South Baffin, saw no candidates nominated in time for the general election. A by-election was scheduled for 3 November 2008, with four candidates.

No people have remained in office through the five general elections that have taken place in Nunavut.

<text>James Frederick Stuart-Wortley JP (16 January 1833 – 27 November 1870) was a politician in New Zealand and the UK. He was New Zealand&#x27;s inaugural Baby of the House and remains the youngest member of parliament in the country&#x27;s history; in fact he was too young (at 20 years and 7 months) to even be legally elected.

==Early life==
Stuart-Wortley was born in York, United Kingdom, on 16 January 1833 and was the third son of the 2nd Lord Wharncliffe and his wife, Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Ryder. He was the younger brother of the 1st Earl of Wharncliffe (1827–1899). Charles James Stuart-Wortley and James Stuart-Wortley were his uncles. Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby was his maternal grandfather.

==Career==
In 1850, he travelled to New Zealand as a colonist on the &quot;Charlotte Jane&quot;, one of the First Four Ships sent by the Canterbury Association. In his first year, he lived with other bachelors in Lyttelton—Charles Bowen, Thomas Hanmer, and Charles Maunsell—in a place dubbed &quot;Singleton House&quot; by Charlotte Godley.

He bought of land at Tai Tapu near Halswell. In October 1852, he purchased Run 53, located between Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora and the Selwyn River. He on-sold the land in June 1853 and it became part of the Harman and Davie&#x27;s Station. Stuart-Wortley then started Hawkeswood Station in partnership with others. This station was located north of the Waiau Uwha River.

===New Zealand parliament===

On 27 August 1853, Stuart-Wortley was elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament as a representative of the Christchurch Country electorate, which consisted of rural Canterbury and much of Westland. Henry Sewell, who kept a &quot;secret&quot; journal, recorded the following about the young man&#x27;s candidacy:

There is doubt whether he is actually of age. The &quot;Peerage&quot; says no, but he says yes, and upon the best authority, namely that of his family lawyers.

Stuart-Wortley was 20 years and 7 months when elected; so was not yet 21, the minimum age to qualify as an elector.

After the first session of Parliament finished in August 1854, Stuart-Wortley travelled with Frederick Weld from Auckland (where Parliament met in those years) to Tauranga, Maketu, and Rotorua. He resigned his seat on 18 July 1855 and returned to the United Kingdom. His seat stayed vacant until the next election, which was held on 20 December 1855 in the Christchurch Country electorate.

===Return to England===
He was appointed a justice of the peace in early 1858. He returned to England later in 1858.

In the UK, he stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1865 general election, when he was an unsuccessful Conservative Party candidate for Sheffield.

==Personal life==
Stuart-Wortley died in England in November 1870, aged 37. His elder brother Edward built St Mary and St John&#x27;s Church, Hardraw as a memorial to him.

<text>The night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis) is a small parrot endemic to the continent of Australia. It has also been known as porcupine parrot, nocturnal ground parakeet, midnight cockatoo, solitaire, spinifex parrot and night parakeet. It is one of the most elusive and mysterious birds in the world, with no confirmed sightings of the bird between 1912 and 1979, leading to speculation that it was extinct. Sightings since 1979 have been extremely rare and the bird&#x27;s population size is unknown, though based on the paucity of records it is thought to number between 50 and 249 mature individuals, and it is classified by the IUCN as a critically endangered species.

A few sightings or recordings of its presence, with varying degrees of certainty, have occurred in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, south-western Queensland, the Lake Eyre basin in South Australia and the Northern Territory. However, some of the evidence produced by wildlife photographer John Young has been called into question, and in March 2019 the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) retracted some of the records created by Young and published by the AWC.

==Taxonomy==
Ornithologist John Gould described the night parrot in 1861, from a specimen—the holotype—that was collected 13 km southeast of Mt Farmer, west of Lake Austin in Western Australia. Its specific epithet is Latin &quot;occidentalis&quot; &quot;western&quot;. The species was originally placed within its own genus (&quot;Geopsittacus&quot;) by Gould, though consensus soon swung in favour of placing it in &quot;Pezoporus&quot;; James Murie dissected a specimen, observing that it was very similar in anatomy and plumage to the ground parrot. Gould had posited a relationship to the kākāpō based on similarity of the plumage, however Murie concluded they were markedly different anatomically. Despite its close relationship with the ground parrot, its placement in the genus &quot;Pezoporus&quot; was uncertain, with some authorities leaving it in its own genus, as data on the night parrot was so limited. A 1994 molecular study using the cytochrome b of several parrot species confirmed the close relationship of the taxa and consensus for its placement in &quot;Pezoporus&quot;. It also revealed that the kākāpō was not closely related to &quot;Pezoporus&quot;. Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences in a 2011 study showed that the night parrot most likely diverged from the ancestor of the eastern and western ground parrots around 3.3 million years ago.

Alternative common names include porcupine parrot, nocturnal ground parakeet, midnight cockatoo, solitaire, spinifex parrot and night parakeet.

==Description==
A relatively small and short-tailed parrot, the species&#x27; colour is predominantly a yellowish green, mottled with dark brown, blacks and yellows. Both sexes have this coloration. It is distinguished from the two superficially similar ground parrot species by its shorter tail and different range and habitat. Predominantly terrestrial, taking to the air only when panicked or in search of water, the night parrot has furtive, nocturnal habits and—even when it was abundant—was apparently a highly secretive species. Its natural habitat appears to be the spinifex grass which still dominates much of the dry, dusty Australian interior; other early reports also indicate that it never strayed far from water. It may also inhabit chenopod shrublands, eucalyptus woodlands, and mallee shrublands. One of the vocalisations of the night parrot has been described as a croak and identified as a contact call. Other calls, mostly short &quot;ding-ding&quot; whistles, and a more drawn out whistle, have been recorded from Queensland and Western Australia.

==Diet==

Historic sources indicate that the night parrot eats seeds of grasses (especially &quot;Triodia&quot;) and herbs.

==Conservation status==
The population size of this species is not known, but assumed to be continuing to decline. , it is listed on the IUCN Red List as Critically endangered. According to the IUCN Red List the night parrot has a population of 40–500, or possibly larger. It is listed as Endangered under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; by the Australian government.

===Important Bird Areas===
Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for night parrot conservation are the Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands of western Queensland, and the Fortescue Marshes of the Pilbara.

==Sightings==
The night parrot remains one of the world&#x27;s most elusive and mysterious birds. Reliable records of the bird have been few and far between, with efforts to locate the species proving fruitless after an authenticated report from 1912.

In 1979, ornithologist Shane Parker from the South Australian Museum spotted an apparent flock of the birds in the far north of South Australia. A roadkill specimen was discovered in 1990 by scientists returning from an expedition in a remote part of Queensland.

===21st-century sightings===

====April 2005: Minga Well sighting====

Three individuals seen near Minga Well, Pilbara region of Western Australia and near the Fortescue Marshes.

The approval of the Cloud Break mine project through the then-Minister for the Environment, Ian Campbell, was criticised because of a number of endangered species in the area of the future mine, among them the night parrot. In order to gain EPA approval, the mine had to implement a management plan to ensure that mining activities would not have a negative effect on the species survival in the area. The occurrence of the night parrot in the future mining area, at Minga Well on 12 April 2005, was discovered during a 2005 survey commissioned by FMG, which was carried out by two contract biologists, Robert Davis and Brendan Metcalf, who sighted a small group of the birds. Unconfirmed sightings of the bird had been made previously in a nearby area in 2004.

The sighting was at dusk, and Davis and Metcalf were not able to obtain a photograph of the three birds they saw, but are confident that they spotted three night parrots. The detailed descriptions of their sighting were accepted by the Birds Australia Rarities Committee (BARC), making it the first accepted night parrot sighting in modern times. Based on this acceptance by scientific peers, a paper describing the sighting was published in the Australian ornithological journal, &quot;Emu&quot;, in 2008. The two biologists carried out further searches at Minga Well and Moojari Well the following five nights after the sighting, but were unable to see the birds again. A follow-up survey of the Fortescue Marsh area in May 2005 was unsuccessful in finding any conclusive evidence of the species.

==== September 2006: Dead individual====
Dead female, flown into a barbed wire fence in Diamantina National Park in south western Queensland.

====April 2015: Live individual capture====

On 4 April 2015, ornithologist Steve Murphy and partner Rachel Barr captured and radio tagged a live individual, whom they nicknamed &quot;Pedro&quot;, in southwestern Queensland. Photographs of the bird in Murphy&#x27;s hand were released to Australian media on 10 August 2015, while keeping the precise location secret. A conservation reserve covering some 56,000 hectares has been created in the area to protect the species.

Sean Dooley of &quot;&quot; described the find as, &quot;The bird watching equivalent of finding Elvis flipping burgers in an outback roadhouse&quot;. South Australian Museum collection manager Philippa Horton called the find, &quot;One of the holy grails, one of the world&#x27;s rarest species probably&quot;.

====2016 – 2021 ====
*2016: Nicholas Leseberg, PhD student at the University of Queensland, photographed a fledgling in 2016 in the Pullen Pullen Reserve in Western Queensland.
* January 2017: Whistle call attributed to night parrot recorded in southern Northern Territory by zoologist Chris Watson and colleague Mark Carter.
*March 2017: Photograph of a living specimen in Western Australia, seen by four birders from Broome.
*February 2018: Image of a young bird, aged 3 to 5 months old, is recorded by Nicholas Leseberg, in Pullen Pullen Reserve.
*June 2017 – April 2018: Targeted environmental survey confirms the presence of night parrots around Kumpupintil Lake in Western Australia.
*November 2018: Second known photo captured in the Great Sandy Desert in the Kimberley region of Western Australia by Indigenous rangers, the Indigenous Desert Lions.
*August 2020: Indigenous rangers of the Martu people and University of Queensland record night parrot sounds in the Pilbara desert, around salt lakes - the fifth confirmed location in Western Australia.
*August 2021: The Martu Rangers capture the fourth confirmed photograph of the parrot in flight in a remote region of Western Australia.

===2013, 2016, 2017: Retracted records ===

*In May 2013 naturalist and wildlife cinematographer John Young, who made headlines in 2006 with an allegedly fake photo series of the blue-browed fig parrot, claimed to have made the first ever photographs and video footage of a living specimen. Young said that he had captured the images and 17-second video after seventeen thousand hours in the field over 15 years of searching. He revealed his results during an invitation-only press conference on 3 July 2013, but kept the exact range in Queensland where he had observed this individual secret to protect this species from poaching. Young provided five feathers from a roost site in the Lake Eyre basin to the Western Australian Museum&#x27;s Molecular Systematics Unit, where DNA analysis conclusively matched the feathers to DNA samples of dead &quot;Pezoporus occidentalis&quot; birds.
* 2016: Young announces he has found night parrots in Diamantina National Park, adjacent to the Pullen Pullen nature reserve. Seven sightings are recorded, including a pair and three active nests with eggs.
* September 2016: Camera trap records what appears to be a night parrot on property owned by the AWC, Kalamurina Station in the northern Lake Eyre region, SA, but the photo is not clear.
* July 2017: Single night parrot feather found in a finch nest on the Kalamurina property, by John Young and Keith Bellchambers from the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.
*September 2018: Recording of a night parrot call, downloaded from an acoustic monitor at Kalamurina.

In October 2018, Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) commenced an investigation into claims that some of John Young&#x27;s first photographs of the night parrot may have been staged, after Australian National University ornithologist Penelope Olsen, author of &quot;Night Parrot: Australia&#x27;s Most Elusive Bird&quot; raised concerns. Young resigned from the AWC in September 2018, and the AWC removed all information about the night parrot from its website.

In March 2019, Young&#x27;s reports were found to have issues relating to robustness of much of his work done in Queensland and South Australia, labelled as unscientific, deceptive and damaging to the AWC. In 2019, the AWC retracted its reports based on work done by Young. A panel of experts had looked at the nest and eggs found at Diamantina (2016); the feather found at Kalamurina (2017); and the recording of the call (2018). They found that each one had separate issues and none could be said to provide robust evidence of the parrot&#x27;s presence.

===2024: a stronghold of up to 50 individuals===
In September 2024, a team of Ngururrpa rangers and scientists announced in the CSIRO publication, &quot;Wildlife Research&quot;, that they had detected a stronghold of up to 50 night parrots, the largest known population of the species, living on the Ngururrpa Indigenous Protected Area, Great Sandy Desert, in Western Australia. The rangers also found a breeding area for the first time, and saw nests, eggs and feathers. The authors of the announcement suggested that the remnant population may have survived due to the presence of cat-eating dingoes.

Commenting on the announcement, a report published by ABC News observed that a sulphate of potash mine proposed for nearby Lake Mackay, and supported by local Aboriginal communities, might present environmental challenges to the newly detected night parrot population. However, the report also noted that Agrimin, the promoter of the proposed mine, was planning conservation measures including fire management, a control program for Feral cats and Red foxes (but not dingoes), and, perhaps most importantly, a curfew on haulage over the private road that would serve the proposed mine.

<text>(alternatively Kikaiga-shima, Kikai Caldera Complex) is a massive, mostly submerged caldera up to in diameter in the Ōsumi Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.

==Geology==
The Kikai Caldera Complex has twin ovoid caldera by in diameter. Yahazu-dake (north west part of Satsuma Io-jima) and Takeshima, located on the caldera rim, are pre-caldera volcanoes. The pre-caldera stage of volcanic activity involved rhyolite, basalt, and andesite phases. The earliest definitive caldera formation has been dated back to at least 140,000 years ago, resulting from the eruption of Koabiyama pyroclastic flows. The formation of caldera has been associated with at least three catastrophic ignimbrite eruptions. Additionally, there are two older deposits (Koseda pyroclastic flows and Anbo tephra) of large caldera-forming eruptions in the vicinity, although their attribution to the Kikai caldera remains controversial.

=== Kikai-Koabiyama eruption ===
The Kikai-Koabiyama (K-Kob) pyroclastic flows are rhyolitic and are distributed across most of Takeshima and the plateau-like area on the northwest side of the caldera rim of Satsuma Iwo-Jima. They consist of numerous thin flow units and fill the basins in the basement, exhibiting significant variation in thickness. In Takeshima, the pyroclastic flows are thick, ranging from , whereas in Iwo Jima, they are relatively thin, measuring a few to .

The eruption of the K-Kob pyroclastic flows has been dated using K-Ar dating to be years before present. While no distal tephra from this eruption has been reported, a tephra layer with potential geochemical and age correlation has been discovered in Lake Suigetsu.

===Kikai-Tozurahara eruption===
Kikai-Tozurahara (K-Tz) tephra is a widespread rhyolitic tephra layer of Late Pleistocene age, attributed to a large VEI-7 eruption from the Kikai caldera. This layer is confirmed to have a wide distribution, extending from south Kyushu to eastern Honshu and reaching the Pacific Ocean, and possibly including the Shandong Peninsula. The proximal equivalents of K-Tz are the Nagase pyroclastic flow and the Nishinoomote pyroclastic surges. The combined bulk volume of both distal and proximal deposits is estimated to exceed .

In marine isotope stratigraphy (MIS), K-Tz is located between MIS 5.2 and 5.3, providing a loosely constrained preliminary eruption age of approximately 95,000 years before present. More reliable age constraints were imposed by the high-resolution chronology derived from the Lake Suigetsu sediment sequence, which yielded an age of years before present for this eruption.

===Kikai-Akahoya eruption===
The caldera was the source of the Kikai-Akahoya eruption, one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene (10,000 years ago to present) that produced the Kikai-Akahoya (K-Ah) tephra. Between 7,200 and 7,300 years ago, pyroclastic flows producing Koya ignimbrite from that eruption reached the coast of southern Kyūshū up to away, and ash fell as far as Hokkaidō. The eruption produced about  DRE, most of it tephra. giving it a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, so making it one of the most explosive in the last 10,000 years, ranking alongside the eruptions of Santorini, Paektu, Crater Lake, Kurile Lake, Samalas and Tambora.

The eruption had a major impact on the Jōmon culture in southern Kyūshū although the impact was not as great as some commentary had suggested with Nishinozono sub-type pottery tradition, that had started prior to the eruption, maintained in Kyūshū.

== 2024 studies ==
Japanese scientists conducted an extensive study of the volcanic activity of the Kikai underwater caldera. They had estimated the volumes of ejected volcanic material, which range from 332 to 457 cubic kilometers, and proved that it was the largest eruption in the last 11,700 years that occurred here 7,300 years ago. They were able to recreate the sequence of a large-scale volcanic event and identified three directions of flow of eruption products: in the atmosphere, along the seabed and along the water&#x27;s edge.

Details of the marine expedition include conducting seismological studies and collecting sediment samples around the Kikai caldera. Scientists have confirmed that volcanic formations on the ocean floor and nearby islands have a common position. Analysis of the distribution of these deposits around the eruption site helps to understand how the pyroclastic flow and water interacted. The eruption occurred with a strong ejection of debris and ash, which corresponds to the usual phase of the Plinian type, during which there was a series of prolonged emissions under high pressure of fragmented lava and pumice in the form of a gas-ash mixture. It was a volumetric pyroclastic flow as a final stage, which partially spread along the seabed and released into the atmosphere in the form of an eruptive column (ash, fragments of pumice, small crystals and tephra). The tephra cloud covered an area of more than 2.8 million km2. The volume of ash material amounted to more than 370 km3 in terms of hard rock. The Plinian phase ended with the destruction of the eruptive column. A huge column of hot tephra fell a few hundred meters from the eruption’s center, causing the formation of a pyroclastic flow.

Since the center of the volcano was under water, the Akahoya eruption had the character of a steam explosion (or a series of explosions) due to the instantaneous release of steam upon contact of hot magma with water. As a result, a double caldera was formed.

Scientists had conducted a detailed study of the spread of volcanic material over an area of about 4,500 square kilometers around the center of the eruption and mapped the thickness of the underwater pyroclastic sediment. In their opinion, 133 to 183 cubic kilometers of pumice and ash settled on the studied area.

After analyzing the textures and nature of the fragments of the underwater volcanic strata, the authors concluded that it was formed from a suspended stream, which can cover long distances even up the slope, as it turned out. Having built a model of the Kikai-Akahoya eruption, researchers have found that in addition to the underwater pyroclastic flow and the powerful release of the tephra cloud into the atmosphere, there was also a third stream of thin volcanic material that spread along the surface of the water to the nearest islands.

===Eruptive history since Kikai-Akahoya eruption===
Kikai is still an active volcano. Io-dake (Mount Iō), Inamura-dake (south coast of Satsuma-Io-jima), Tokara-Iwo-Jima (north east coast of Satsuma-Io-jima) and Shōwa Iōjima (Shin-Io-jima) are post-caldera volcanoes within it. Minor eruptions occur frequently on Mount Iō, one of the post-caldera subaerial volcanic peaks on Iōjima. Iōjima is one of three volcanic islands, two of which lie on the caldera rim. On June 4, 2013, weak tremors were recorded. Shortly after, eruptions began and continued off-and-on for several hours. Io-dake is monitored for earthquake, gas and steam plume activity so that between the 2020 and 2023 eruptions it is known to have had continuous low grade activity.

<doc id="1004258" wikidata="Q1071681" url="?curid=1004258" title="Orange-bellied parrot">
<text>The orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) is a small parrot endemic to southern Australia, and one of only three species of parrot that migrate. It was described by John Latham in 1790. A small parrot around long, it exhibits sexual dimorphism. The adult male is distinguished by its bright grass-green upper parts, yellow underparts and orange belly patch. The adult female and juvenile are duller green in colour. All birds have a prominent two-toned blue frontal band and blue outer wing feathers.

The orange-bellied parrot breeds in Tasmania and winters on the coast of southern mainland Australia, foraging on saltmarsh species, beach or dune plants and a variety of exotic weed species. The diet consists of seeds and berries of small coastal grasses and shrubs. With a wild population of 14 birds as of early February 2017, it is regarded as a critically endangered species. The orange-bellied parrot is rated as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of Endangered species.

Orange-bellied parrots are being bred in a captive breeding program with parrots in Taroona, Tasmania, Healesville Sanctuary, Adelaide Zoo, Moonlit Sanctuary Wildlife Conservation Park and Priam Parrot Breeding Centre. The captive population consists of around 300 birds, with a target of 350 birds by 2016–17. Because of the decline in the wild population in recent years, an additional 21 birds from the wild population were captured in 2010–2011 to improve the genetic diversity of the species&#x27; captive breeding program. Taken as a whole, the captive population, an example of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation, is termed an &quot;insurance population&quot; against extinction.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The orange-bellied parrot was first described by ornithologist John Latham as &quot;Psittacus chrysogaster&quot; in 1790, from a specimen (since lost) that had been collected from Adventure Bay in Tasmania in March 1773 on the second voyage of James Cook or in January 1777 on his third voyage, and subsequently been in Joseph Banks&#x27; collection. The species name was derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;chrysos&quot; (&quot;golden&quot;) and &quot;gaster&quot; (&quot;belly&quot;). John Gould described it in 1841 as &quot;Euphema aurantia&quot;, from an adult male specimen collected in southeast Tasmania that became the lectotype. The species name was the Latin adjective for &quot;orange&quot;. Tasmanian clergyman Thomas James Ewing named it &quot;Nanodes gouldii&quot;, in honour of Gould, who he believed had discovered it. No subspecies are recognised.

Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori erected the new genus &quot;Neophema&quot; in 1891, placing the orange-bellied parrot within it and giving it its current scientific name. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus &quot;Neophema&quot;, it is one of four classified in the subgenus &quot;Neonanodes&quot;. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA published in 2021 indicated the ancestor of the orange-bellied parrot diverged from a lineage giving rise to the elegant, blue-winged and rock parrots most likely between 2.35 and 3.48 million years ago. 

&quot;Orange-bellied parrot&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). Gould called it the orange-bellied grass parakeet. It has previously been known as the &quot;orange-breasted parrot&quot;—a name given to the orange-bellied parrot in 1926 by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union or RAOU (now Birdlife Australia) when the word &quot;belly&quot; was considered inelegant. Other names include yellow-bellied parrot, orange-bellied grass-parakeet, and trumped-up corella.

==Description==
The orange-bellied parrot is a small parrot around long; the adult male has bright green head, neck and upperparts, and yellow-green breast, abdomen and flanks. The feathers of the cheeks, neck and underparts are yellow-green with lime green tips and fringes, and hence appear more bright green when the bird has just moulted and more yellowish as the plumage wears. Feathers on the crown are bright green with darker green tips. It has a prominent, two-toned blue frontal band, with a lighter blue border both above and below the horizontal dark blue band. On the belly is an oval patch of orange around 2 cm in diameter. The undertail coverts are yellow to pale yellow. The uppertail is green-blue with yellow sides. The under wing-coverts and flight feathers are dark blue, with paler blue median wing-coverts. The upper mandible of the bill is blackish grey with a greyish, orange-brown or salmon-coloured base and cutting edge, while the lower mandible a brownish orange a grey-black tip. The cere is blackish grey with a pale brown tinge around the nostrils, the orbital eye-ring is light grey and the iris is dark brown. The legs and feet are dark grey with a red tinge between scales. The adult female has slightly duller shades of green plumage overall, with a paler blue frontal band. Its orange belly patch is about 30% smaller and less distinct. Moulting takes place in late winter and early spring. The juvenile is a duller green to yellow-olive colour overall, with a much less prominent blue frontal band above the eyes. It has a dull yellowish or orange bill, which darkens to brown by the time the bird is three months old.

The orange-bellied parrot most commonly utters a single-note buzzing sound that is repeated every one to three seconds as a contact call. This is generally made by orange-bellied parrots while flying, but also by birds seeing others in flight. The alarm call is a quickly repeated &quot;tzeet&quot; that has a buzzing quality. Individuals may make this call when flushed from cover. The &quot;gurgle-buzz&quot; call is made by birds acting as sentries at feeding areas, and is a mixture of an alarm call interspersed with chattering and hissing. When feeding, orange-bellied parrots may make soft low-pitched chitting sounds.

The blue-winged and elegant parrots can be mistaken for the orange-bellied parrot; however, their tinkling alarm calls and lighter olive-green upperparts distinguish them. Their blue frontal bands have only light blue border on one side. Blue-winged and female elegant parrots have yellow plumage behind and above the eye.

== Distribution and habitat ==
One of three migratory parrot species, the orange-bellied parrot breeds solely in South West Tasmania, it nests in eucalypts bordering on button grass moors, generally within 30 km of the coast. The entire population migrates over Bass Strait to spend the winter on the coast of south-eastern Australia. On the way, they may stop (and occasionally overwinter on) King Island, particularly Lake Flannigan. The few mainland sites are estuaries and lagoons that contain their favoured salt marsh habitat and are generally within 3 km of the coast. These include sites in or close to Port Phillip such as Werribee Sewage Farm, the Spit Nature Conservation Reserve, the shores of Swan Bay, Swan Island, Lake Connewarre State Wildlife Reserve, Lake Victoria and Mud Islands, as well as French Island in Western Port.

In late 2017, there was a possible sighting at Canunda National Park in South Australia; the most recent confirmed sighting in the state being five years beforehand at Port MacDonnell. In July 2021, two individuals were recorded at Arthur River in northwestern Tasmania; it is unclear whether they had returned early from the mainland or did not migrate across the Bass Strait at all.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
In the wild, the orange-bellied parrot tends to be monogamous, though a bird will seek a new mate if its old one has died. However, males can mate with multiple females in captivity. Pairs can form on the mainland before migration or after arrival in Tasmania. The orange-bellied parrot is capable of breeding in its first year of life. The oldest known individual in the wild is known as blue/black F. At over nine years old, it is thought to have made 20 trips across Bass Strait.
Breeding is restricted to southwestern Tasmania, generally within 20 km (12 mi) of Melaleuca. The breeding season is November to February, with birds arriving at Melaleuca in early October, after which time they begin looking for suitable sites for nesting. They nest in hollows in mature trees—usually Smithton peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus nitida&quot;) or sometimes swamp gum (&quot;E. ovata&quot;). The entrance is a wide hole in a broken branch or trunk, the hollow itself being up to deep. Since 1991, nest boxes have been built to increase the number of suitable nest sites. The female cleans out the hollow and lays the almost round white eggs on a layer of rotten wood. The clutch consists of 3 to 6 (average 4.5) eggs measuring 21.6 mm × 18.1 mm, with the eggs being laid at two day intervals. A pair will re-use a successful nesting site, with some sites used for up to six years. The female commonly remains in the nest for several days before laying.

The female incubates the eggs for 21–24 days. During this time, the male forages up to from the site. The eggs hatch 1–2 days apart, and the young are nidicolous and semi-altricial—that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. They are initially covered in off-white down. The female remains on the nest for another 10 days, still fed by the male, after which time they both feed the young. By two weeks of age, larger nestlings come to the mouth of the hollow to be fed. The young fledge at 4–5 weeks old.

===Feeding===
The orange-bellied parrot is found in pairs or small flocks, and generally remain on the ground or in low foliage searching for food. They alternate between feeding and resting quietly, beginning just before or after dawn and resting mid-morning. In the breeding season, males feed and forage constantly to supply their mates with food while incubating, and both parents do so to feed their young. Early in the breeding season, they prefer areas that were burnt 7 to 15 years previously, while by mid-breeding season, they seek out areas that are 3 to 5 years post fire. Their most important food plants are beaded glasswort (&quot;Salicornia quinqueflora&quot;) and shrubby glasswort (&quot;Tecticornia arbuscula&quot;). Other foods include the seeds of the coast fescue (&quot;Poa triodioides&quot;, syn. &quot;Austrofestuca littoralis&quot;), saltbush (&quot;Atriplex cinerea&quot;), Austral seablite (&quot;Suaeda australis&quot;) and sea heath (&quot;Frankenia pauciflora&quot;), as well as berries, such as those of &quot;Coprosma&quot;. They have also been reported eating kelp. The orange-bellied parrot generally roosts at night in trees or tall shrubs within of feeding locations.

==Conservation==

The orange-bellied parrot was once much more widespread; it was found along the mainland coastline from Sydney to Adelaide outside the breeding season. Its range has shrunk with the loss and degradation of habitat. Around 1889, it had been recorded in various places around Sydney, including Malabar, Penshurst, Bankstown, Blacktown and Middle Head. A 1907 report of two birds caught in Riverstone might have been aviary escapees. In Victoria, it was a regular visitor to Port Fairy until 1967. In South Australia, it was reported as common in the Yorke Peninsula in the 1880s, and a rare visitor to the Fleurieu Peninsula before the 1940s.

A 2018 study ranked the bird second as the Australian bird most likely to go extinct.

, the orange-bellied parrot is rated as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of Endangered species. The 2016–17 breeding season saw the wild population drop to 16 confirmed individuals—13 males and 3 females. The 2019–2020 breeding season saw the wild population had recover to 118 individuals by April. By December 2021, 70 birds had returned to breed for the 2021–22 season, building on the previous year&#x27;s total of 51 individuals.

By 2007, its had been status upgraded from endangered to critically endangered on the Commonwealth &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;.

* The 2000 Action Plan for Australian Birds lists it as critically endangered (Garnett and Crowley 2000).
* In a report on threatened and extinct birds in Australia in 1992, it was listed as endangered (Garnett 1992).
* In a report on threatened birds in Australia in 1990, it was listed as endangered (Brouwer and Garnett 1990).

The orange-bellied parrot has been recorded from four states within Australia: Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Its conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example:

* The orange-bellied parrot is listed as &quot;threatened&quot; on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.
* On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the orange-bellied parrot is listed as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

===Recovery program===
In early 2011, 21 new &#x27;founders&#x27; were collected from the wild to improve the captive flock&#x27;s genetic diversity. These birds were shared among the three core institutions with previous orange-bellied parrot breeding experience (Taroona, Healesville Sanctuary and Adelaide Zoo) and were paired with existing captive birds to begin spreading new genes through the captive population.

In May 2011, media attention focussed on the 10 individuals transferred by aircraft from Tasmania to Healesville Sanctuary near Melbourne, which was described as a last-ditch effort to save the species from extinction. It is hoped that the new additions from the wild will improve the genetic diversity of the 80 birds at Healesville Sanctuary, which are all descended from three pairs. Captive populations in Hobart and Adelaide are also important to the aim of releasing captive bred birds back to the wild.

In July, 2012, it was announced that 19 of 21 pairs with founders had produced eggs and that across all three institutions, 31 fledglings had been produced from these new pairs.

Captive breeding was expanded at the end of 2011 when Priam Australia Pty Ltd., a commercial parrot breeding centre in New South Wales, received five pairs of orange-bellied parrots.

In August, 2012, a private zoo, Moonlit Sanctuary in Pearcedale, Victoria, received seven birds for display and possible breeding. The same month, another private zoo, Halls Gap Zoo in western Victoria, received five pairs of birds for breeding. In 2016 Moonlit Sanctuary opened a dedicated facility for 20 pairs, while Halls Gap had withdrawn from the program in the previous year. With three larger breeding facilities and two smaller groups of birds involved in the captive breeding program, it is hoped the captive population will increase quickly.

Carolyn Hogg and colleagues suggested that the low genetic diversity could be boosted by select breeding with a close relative. Of its three closest relatives, the blue-winged parrot is most similar in behaviour and habitat preferences, and hence is recommended for a captive trial of interspecific hybridization to improve genetic diversity.

==Threats==
The 2000 Action Plan for Australian Birds identifies the following potential threats to the orange-bellied parrot:

* Fragmentation and degradation of over-wintering habitat
* Competition with introduced seed-eaters
* Abandonment of former breeding habitat due to altered fire regime and competition for hollows (with the introduced common starling)
* Random events due to the small size of the population
* Disorientation from brightly lit fishing boats (during the migrations across Bass Strait)
* Introduced predators
* Disease (such as psittacine circoviral disease)

Other identified potential threats include:

* Lack of safety in numbers for a small bird attractive to avian predators (Brouwer and Garnett 1990)
* Historically was trapped for aviculture (Garnett 1992)
* A stomach virus is threatening a breeding program for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot.

In 2013, the Orange-bellied Parrot Recovery Team&#x27;s Annual Report for 2012/13 (published October 2013) outlined the reasons for its decline and the threats to the orange-bellied parrot as follows:

...Current knowledge suggests that habitat loss and degradation, particularly in the non-breeding range, has caused the decline. Low breeding participation by females has been implicated in recent declines (2000–2010). The species is also at risk from climate change, and the small population size places the species at increased risk from factors such as loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding, stochastic environmental events, predators and competitors, disease, and barriers to migration and movement.

==Impact on industrial development==
The orange-bellied parrot earned the wrath of Victorian premier Jeff Kennett in the 1990s. A proposed relocation of the Coode Island chemical storage facility to a location near Point Wilson, Victoria was jeopardised by the potential impacts upon orange-bellied parrot habitat. Mr Kennett described this species as a &#x27;trumped-up corella&#x27;.

Orange-bellied parrots were considered in the impact assessment for the Woolnorth windfarm on Tasmania&#x27;s north-west coast. The planning proposal was thoroughly assessed by both State and Commonwealth regulators (having been determined to be a controlled action under the EPBC Act).

Surveys and collision risk modeling were undertaken as well as a population viability analysis to assess the impact on the species. The wind-farm is not in the flight path of OBPs, but they do pass near by. In 2001, then Australian federal environment minister Robert Hill approved the wind-farm.

To date no orange-bellied parrots have been found to collide with the turbines. Monitoring continues today as well as measures to reduce OBPs coming near the wind-farm.

In 2006, the potential threats to the orange-bellied parrot were cited as the key reason for the Commonwealth Minister rejecting the proposal to build the Bald Hills Wind Farm in eastern Victoria. It was found there were no significant risks to the species, and the decision was reversed. The company was provided with approval to proceed (under certain conditions). The intense media scrutiny at this time placed the orange-bellied parrot temporarily into the spotlight. In the subsequent months additional funding was provided for the parrot&#x27;s recovery, and its status under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was raised from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

==Aviculture==
The orange-bellied parrot was first bred successfully in 1973 by South Australian aviculturist Fred Lewitska, after five years with no success. He repeated his success in 1974 before being directed to release the birds into the wild by authorities. He found that the species could be inactive in an aviary and was prone to obesity, like the related rock parrot. Victorian birdwatcher, artist and photographer Len Robinson bred orange-bellied parrots in suburban Melbourne between 1998 and 2006. He held four pairs for eight breeding seasons, fledging a total of 47.

<text>Juan Martín de Pueyrredón y O&#x27;Dogan (December 18, 1777 – March 13, 1850) was an Argentine general and politician of the early 19th century. He was appointed Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata after the Argentine Declaration of Independence.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pueyrredón was born in Buenos Aires, the fifth of eight sons of Juan Martín de Pueyrredón y Labroucherie, and his wife, María Rita Damasia O&#x27;Doggan y Soria. Pueyrredon&#x27;s father was a French merchant who established himself in Cádiz with his brother, and later in Buenos Aires, where he married his wife, who was of Spanish and partial Irish descent. He was educated at the Royal College until the death of his father in 1791. María became the head of the family, assisted by Anselmo Sáenz Valiente in business, and withdrew Juan Martín from his studies at the age of 14. He then moved to live with a relative in Cádiz, Spain to learn about commerce. His first business took him to Madrid and France. He returned briefly to Buenos Aires to deal with his father&#x27;s will, and married his cousin Dolores Pueyrredón, daughter of Diego de Pueyrredón y Labrucherie and Maman Mairoluo, in Spain in 1803. They returned to Buenos Aires, but Dolores miscarried during the trip. Pueyrredón thought of returning to Spain with her, hoping to restore her health by visiting her family, but she miscarried again and her health worsened, until she died in May 1805.

===British invasions===

Buenos Aires was invaded by British forces in 1806, during the first of two British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Pueyrredón was among the criollos who did not believe that the British would help them to become independent from Spain. He moved to Montevideo and got an interview with governor Pascual Ruiz Huidobro. Huidobro authorized him to organize a resistance, so he returned to Buenos Aires and secretly prepared an army at the Perdriel ranch. The British, however, discovered it and defeated the half-prepared army. Pueyrredón escaped to Colonia del Sacramento and joined Santiago de Liniers, whose army would eventually defeat the British.

In 1807, he was sent as representative of Buenos Aires to Spain again, but returned in 1809 via Brazil to Buenos Aires, where he subsequently participated in the independentist movement. After the May Revolution of 1810, which gave birth to the first local government junta, he was appointed governor of Córdoba, and in 1812 he became the leader of the independent forces and a member of the short-lived First Triumvirate. From 1812 to 1815, he was exiled in San Luis.

===Supreme director===

In 1816, Pueyrredón was elected Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. He strongly supported José de San Martín&#x27;s military campaign in Chile, and also founded the first national bank of Argentina and the national mint. After the declaration of a Unitarian constitution, revolts forced him to resign as Supreme Director in 1819 and go into exile in Montevideo. He subsequently played a very small role in politics, most notably serving in 1829 as a mediator between Juan Manuel de Rosas and Juan Lavalle. He died in retirement on his ranch in San Isidro, Buenos Aires.

==Personal life==
During his time in San Luis, Pueyrredón had an illegitimate daughter, Virginia, with Juana Sánchez. In 1815, at the age of 39, he married his 14-year-old second wife María Calixta Tellechea y Caviedes; Rivadavia, Pueyrredón and Chiclana of the First Triumvirate had had her father executed three years before as a member of the royalist conspiracy of Martín de Alzaga. The Pueyrredóns&#x27; only male child and one daughter, Virginia Pueyrredon, married to Cnel. Jose Maria Pelliza Gomez de Rospigliosi in San Isidro. Prilidiano was born in Buenos Aires on January 24, 1823. He became a civil engineer and artist, and has been called the first Argentine painter; he had no children. From 1835 to 1849, Pueyrredón and his family lived in Europe.

<text>Budapesti Közlekedési Zrt. or BKV Zrt. (, &quot;Budapest Transit Company&quot;, the abbreviation BKV stands for its earlier name Budapesti Közlekedési Vállalat) is the main public transport operator in Budapest, Hungary. BKV was established in 1968 as a unified public transport company with the merger of the companies responsible for the different means of transport; bus operator FAÜ (&quot;Fővárosi Autóbuszüzem&quot;), tram and trolleybus operator FVV (&quot;Fővárosi Villamosvasút&quot;), suburban railway operator BHÉV (&quot;Budapesti Helyiérdekű Vasút&quot;) and riverboat operator FHV (&quot;Fővárosi Hajózási Vállalat&quot;). The metro was added in 1973. The transport in Budapest underwent another reorganization in 2010 when the BKK (&quot;Budapesti Közlekedési Központ&quot;, &quot;Budapest Transit Centre&quot;) was founded for the management of the city transport and infrastructure.

Since then, BKV is the largest public transport contractor of BKK, operating 4 metro, 33 tram, and 15 trolley bus lines, and 30% of the 231 local bus and 40 night bus lines.

==Road vehicle operation==

City-owned BKV runs most of the vehicles of the extensive network of surface mass transportation in Budapest, with the emphasis on buses. The 900~ BKV-owned buses in Budapest circulate on 30% of the 231 routes. The buses are painted sky blue. Trolleybuses in red livery are operated on 15 lines. The night service is provided exclusively by buses and by the trams on Great Boulevard. The articulated bus is a hallmark of Budapest; both diesel and ETB bendy vehicles have been running since the late 1950s and still form the majority of BKV&#x27;s fleet.

The late-2000s road rebuilding effort (affecting 50% of the city&#x27;s principal roadways) also changed the lanes, creating distinct lanes for vehicles turning left at traffic-light crossings, for example. This reduced the travel time of the buses. Completing the eastern sector of M0 beltway around the city in 2008 significantly reduced traffic congestion, the inauguration of metro line M4 in 2014 further helped the situation. Competitive wages are still a serious issue as bus drivers are often lured to the trucking industry.

==Rail services==

BKV operates 33 city tram lines, including the Budapest Cog Railway that operates as tram line 60. The once-extensive network of tram tracks and the brown striped yellow trams were a characteristic of Budapest, but the network was curtailed under Communism owing to lack of funding. Line 4-6 is still the largest capacity tram-line in Europe. The tram services are now set to have a renaissance as there is no further road capacity for bus lanes in Budapest. Replacing the more than 40-year-old rolling stock started in 2006 with new 54-meter long Siemens Combino Supra giants completely replacing former carriages on the 4-6 line.

The underground railway network is less extensive, consisting of four lines. The M1 line (or Földalatti), whose colour is yellow, is a small underground tramway inaugurated in 1896. The other three are full-sized metro lines: M2 (red), M3 (blue) and M4 (green). M2 and M4 run roughly east–west, while M3 runs mostly north–south. There is a plan for a high-speed rail link to Ferihegy BUD international airport, which is currently served by bus from the end of the metro line M3. – &quot;See the main article Budapest Metro.&quot; In 2005 a &quot;BEB&quot; monthly pass was introduced for a 10% extra cost over the regular price, which permitted the use of the MÁV national railway lines within the city area, effectively increasing the tracked service for BKV&#x27;s passengers. Since 2009, all monthly (and 15-day) passes, now called a &quot;Budapest Pass&quot;, are valid on the national railway and suburban bus lines within city boundaries.

==Passenger statistics==

As of 2009, approximately 54% of the passenger traffic in Budapest, a city of 1.7 million inhabitants, is still carried by BKV vehicles, with the remaining 46% using private vehicles. During 2003 a total of 1.4 billion people travelled by BKV. During the Socialist era, Budapest had 2 million residents and its public vs. private transport ratio (the so-called modal split) was 80% : 20% in favor of mass transit. This ratio was a result of artificial restriction: COMECON rules did not allow Hungary to produce private cars domestically and Dacia / Lada / Škoda / Trabant / Wartburg (marque) car imports were never enough. (After the Iron Curtain fell, a large number of second hand cars were imported from Austria and Western Europe, leading to rapid private motorisation of Budapest&#x27;s streets.)

==Funding==

After the fall of Communism, BKV was traditionally plagued by a lack of funding. It survived by selling some of its garages and repair bases for mall and housing development. As of October 2009 the average BKV diesel bus was 16.5 years old and the oldest one of the 1,400 strong fleet was 24 years old, with 3.5 million kilometers to its track record. Yet starting in 2010, a bus replacement program scrapped most of those old buses and increased the ratio of modern, air-conditioned low-floor buses to 80% by 2016. Since November 2022, BKV operates only low-floor buses.

In 2006, Siemens Combino Supra trams completely replaced the carriages serving the Grand Boulevard. In the same year, French Alstom metro trains were ordered to replace all Soviet carriages on metro line M2 and to serve on metro line M4, the construction of which had started in that year. All units for both lines entered service by 2014, in which year 47 air-conditioned, low-floor CAF trams were purchased. BKV had the opportunity to purchase an additional 77 trams, which they did throughout the following years until 2023, when they purchased the last remaining trams. In 2016, the more than 30 years old Russian trains running on metro line M3, produced by Mytishchi Machine-building Factory, started to be refurbished by the legal successor Metrowagonmash. The first train arrived back in Budapest in May 2016, with the rest of the trains arriving throughout 2016 and 2017. On March 20, 2017 the first refurbished train began its journey on line M3. Since April 3, 2018 only renovated trains run on line M3.

BKV operates on a net-loss basis; state-mandated ticket prices cover less than 50% of running costs. The state circumvents EU regulations by failing to fully compensate the BKV company for operating costs and amortization.

== Season tickets and passes==

BKV uses a paper-based system of tickets and passes; as of December 2015 a monthly pass allowing one adult to travel on any BKV vehicle costs (approximately , ). Students (of any age) and children get a discount of around 65%; the elderly travel free. Passes are not transferable.

Starting June 20, 2023, bus line 100E (Airport Express) introduced Budapest Pay&amp;GO. This method of ticket management had been planned for the entire transit system of Budapest for years, but only now is it materialized. As of July 2023, it is only available on bus line 100E, but BKV is planning to begin a testing phase on metro line M1, hoping to introduce it on all types of transit in Budapest and revolutionize Budapest&#x27;s ticket system.

===People with disabilities===

All of the BKV buses are wheelchair accessible. There are also a few small-sized special BKV buses, which can be reserved by phone to transport a person using a wheelchair. Metro line M4 has public lifts installed in every station. Most of line M2&#x27;s stations only have escalators, excluding Puskás Ferenc Stadion, Pillangó utca and Örs vezér tere. Before its major renovation, line M3 only had elevators at Kőbánya-Kispest, but during the renovation, elevators were installed at every station. Line M1 is planned to be renovated, and equipped with elevators at every station.

Currently available regular service line with handicapped-compatible low-floor vehicles:

Metro
* line M1: Only stations Deák Ferenc tér, Széchenyi fürdő, Mexikói út (a disabled person has to ask for the operator of the wheelchair lift; lifts non-functional since at least 2009)
* line M2: Only stations Puskás Ferenc Stadion, Pillangó utca, Örs vezér tere
* line M3: All stations
* line M4: All stations
Tram
* 1: all vehicles at weekends (33-50% at weekdays)
* 3: most of the vehicles
* 4, 6: all vehicles
* 17, 19: half of the vehicles
* 24G: some vehicles in the after morning and evening peak times

Since November 2022, every bus line has low-floor buses, with trolleybus lines having low-floor buses most of the time.

==Description of major vehicle types used by BKV==

===Buses===

====Present fleet====
* Ikarus 412: Hungarian made, long, entirely low-floor buses; built from 1999 to 2001. The type is a serious failure, manufactured during the final decline of the Ikarus company; literally no two vehicles are identical in the 412 fleet. A number of vehicles have been already refurbished since 2009. Several engine compartment fires forced BKV to rebuild the propulsion cells and the chassis is still prone to fracture. Suffers from narrower rear door and gangway. The reduced size of the rear passenger doors can cause problems during peak hours. All of which are painted in a light shade of blue. The 16 buses operating as of February 2024 will be taken out of service during 2024.
* Ikarus V127 / Modulo M108d: Built in PKD (partially knocked down kit) cooperation between MABI and BKV from 2014 to 2016. long, entirely low-floor buses, non-articulated version of the Ikarus V187 / Modulo M168d. The first 18 were manufactured under the Ikarus brand, with the other 49 gaining the Modulo branding. The two versions have no differences but are equally criticized for being poorly built, together with the articulated version.
* Ikarus V187 / Modulo M168d: Originally one, Hungarian made, long, entirely low-floor, articulated bus, built in 2010. The longest bus in BKV&#x27;s fleet, and also the most environmentally friendly one, fitted with a Euro-5 engine. In 2016, manufacturing of these buses resumed, now under the name Modulo M168d, and a redesigned front and back. 
* Volvo 7700: Polish made, built in 2004. BKV bought 38 used Volvo 7700 vehicles from Veldhoven in 2012 to replace Ikarus 412&#x27;s in the hilly routes of Buda, where they ran unreliably. (The 412&#x27;s were reassigned to generally flatter areas in Pest.) These Volvos finally entered service in early 2013 and are painted in a light shade of blue officially termed &quot;sky blue&quot;. They are equipped with automatic climate control.Volvo 7700A: Polish made, built specifically for Budapest, long articulated buses, based on Swedish B7LA chassis. Considered a technological marvel by experts for cramming four double doors and a usable gangway into a fully low-floor vehicle with vertically mounted engine. Current fleet of 81 arrived in three batches of fifty in 2004/2005/2006. Some passengers do not like them because of the cramped standing areas (low floor design causes slimmer standing areas), and slower run times (due to poor road conditions, especially on route 7). During their service years, they have become liked vehicles because of their higher comfort level and quietness. All of them have automatic climate control, (the first 50 was equipped with it later), which was unique to BKV&#x27;s bus fleet at the time of their arrival.
* Van Hool A300, newA330: Belgian made, long low-floor buses, 13 of them built in 2000-2001 and bought by BKV in 2011. At BKV they were equipped with automatic climate control, repainted in BKV&#x27;s signature blue livery. A further 66 Van Hool newA330 buses were purchased from Dijon and Lausanne, with these being powered by CNG and equipped with automatic climate control.
* Van Hool AG300: Belgian-made, long articulated bus, the articulated version of the A300. The AG300 is a special type of fully low-floor buses - the engine is located between the first and the second axles, so the third axle can be steered. 32 of them were bought by BKV in the summer of 2009 to ease the lack of modern vehicles. They were built in 2000-2001 and used in Brussels. At BKV they were equipped with automatic climate control, and were repainted into standard colors in 2013. 25 more were purchased in 2015 from Utrecht, these being the newer newAG300. Passengers noticed them for narrow inner space of the fore part, although the back has rather a large standee place.

* Mercedes-Benz Citaro: Purchased and entered service in 2012, these buses were bought used from various Western-European cities. long, entirely low-floor buses. As a result from originating from different places, certain buses can have major differences between each other. The ones manufactured the earliest are the C1 type, and are quite disliked because of their loud motors and doors. They are also notorious for being flammable and catching on fire. All have been retrofitted with larger windows and the standard BKV colors. 150 brand new Citaro C2 buses were purchased in 2013, and were operated by ArrivaBus until the end of their contract in 2023, when apart from four instructor, one single and one articulated bus, all of them were taken out of service. BKV purchased 21 CNG-powered Citaro C1&#x27;s from Sweden in 2016, but similar to the regular C1&#x27;s they were unreliable and eventually decided to take all buses out of service only 4 years after buying them.
* Mercedes-Benz Conecto: Turkish made, long, entirely low-floor buses. As of February 2024, there are 201 of these buses in service, entering service from 2015 to 2022, making them the largest number of non-articulated buses in BKV&#x27;s fleet. The ones that arrived in 2022 were the first buses in Budapest to have the new registration plates, and new, white dot-matrix screens on the front and back on the bus, replacing the orange dot-matrix screens found on the majority of buses in Budapest.
* Mercedes-Benz Conecto G: Turkish made, long, entirely low-floor buses, articulated version of the Mercedes-Benz Conecto. Similarly to the non-articulated version, these buses hold the title of the most articulated buses in BKV&#x27;s fleet, with 318 in service as of February 2024. As a result, you can find them anywhere throughout Budapest. They first arrived in 2015, together with the non-articulated version with more buses coming until 2022. 

====Former types====
* Ikarus 260: Hungarian made, long, entirely high-floor buses, built from 1971 to 2002. Considered the &quot;workhorse&quot;, it negotiated poor road conditions and heavy use easily, but passengers suffered a lot of noise and vibration from the under-floor mounted engine. Their age often caused concern both among laymen and experts, but their exceptionally sturdy and serviceable build allowed them to reach an age of approximately 30 years. The last remaining vehicles were taken out service in November 2022.
* Ikarus 263: Hungarian made, long, entirely high-floor buses, built from 1999 to 2001. A longer and more modern version of Ikarus 260.
* Ikarus 280: Hungarian made articulated version of the Ikarus 260, built from 1973 to 2003. Some of the fleet were entirely rebuilt in 1997 and painted in red-blue livery for use on 7-173 express routes, but from 2008 onward, they were repainted in the standard blue. The last remaining vehicles were taken out service in November 2022.
* Ikarus 405: Hungarian made and without rear passenger doors, long, partially low-floor midibuses for weight-restricted routes, such as the Castle District and Gellért Hill. Manufactured in 1995. The design was extremely compact, which resulted in a cramped passenger compartment. Equipped with fragile independent front suspension, it was prone to roll, but was still expected to run on hilly routes, for lack of a replacement. The reduced size of the front passenger doors could cause problems during peak hours. Most Ikarus 405 vehicles had tilted, 3 shade green striping painted at the front and back, except for those rebuilt in 2011 and 2012, which had blue-grey two-tone paint schemes instead. The majority had been replaced by the Turkish made Karsan Atak, partially low-floor buses. The last remaining vehicles were taken out service in January 2023.
* Ikarus 415: Hungarian made, long, built from 1987 to 2002. Their rear-mounted DAF diesel engines were famous for their terrible roar, scaring passers-by, but the cab was quieter. The reduced size of the rear passenger doors on the later models could cause problems during peak hours. Almost all Ikarus 415 vehicles originally had tilted, 3 shade green striping at the front and rear, though the stripes had been removed from many of them during recent maintenance.The last remaining vehicles were taken out service in November 2022.
*Ikarus 435: Hungarian made, long articulated version of Ikarus 415; built from 1985 to 2002. Initially equipped with pusher-type articulated drive, they suffered a lot of technical problems and struggled with chassis weaknesses until the end. The reduced size of the last pair of passenger doors could cause problems during peak hours. They were generally liked by passengers, as their high floor was lower than the Ikarus 200 series&#x27; very high floor level. Along with the Ikarus 280 and Volvo 7700A, the Ikarus 435 was the workhorse of the BKV bus fleet. It was common to see rebuilt versions around the city. These vehicles had tilted, 3 shade green stripes at the front and back, which was gradually being phased out in recent repaints, as with Ikarus 415 and Ikarus 405. The last remaining vehicles were taken out service in November 2022.
* Renault Agora: Branded as &quot;Ikarus Agora&quot; by the manufacturer Renault-Irisbus (the owner of Ikarus at the time of purchase), this long low-floor, articulated bus is not really an Ikarus, but rather a French-made vehicle rebranded to improve public perception. Only one bus is in service, given to BKV by Irisbus as compensation for delayed shipments. Taken out of service on 1 July 2019.

ArrivaBus (formerly known as VT-Transman, later on VT-Arriva) is one of BKK&#x27;s contractors running some routes with their own vehicles, but those vehicles have blue-grey painting like BKV&#x27;s, and they are completely integrated in BKK system. Volánbusz and its subcontractors runs suburban lines. But they are members of Budapest Transport Organization (BKSZ), so their lines can be used by regular tickets inside the city (300s, 600s, 700s, 800s and 2000s lines).

===Trolleybuses===

====Present fleet====
*Ikarus 280T: Ikarus 280 articulated body equipped with Ganz chopper-based electronics. As of February 2024, there are only 9 of these trolleybuses left in service, mostly only serving in peak hours and are rumored to be taken out of service in 2025.
* Ikarus 411/412T: The 412T is a long low floor Ikarus 412 body equipped with Kiepe electronics. Limited fleet, resulting from the collapse of Ikarus and BKV&#x27;s lack of funds during the late 1990s. The similar-looking, 11 m long 411T is, however, a unique vehicle which is a couple of years older: it was an Ikarus test trolleybus, and later it was transferred to BKV as a compensation for delayed shipments. In 2023, 6 Ikarus 412T trolleybuses were taken out of service. There are currently seven original Ikarus 412T trolleybuses in BKV&#x27;s fleet, and two that were built from Ikarus 412 buses.
* Solaris Trollino: Polish-made fully low-floor buses designed as genuine ETB vehicles. They do surprisingly well on bad Budapest roads, but the fleet is limited: BKV operates only 16 of them. Following the fiscal collapse of the Ganz Transelektro Group, the local co-manufacturer the delivery of the 2nd series was delayed for several months, and was finalized by Skoda, the new owner of Ganz Transelektro. In 2015, 36 new, Škoda-Solaris Trollino trolleybuses arrived. 12 of them are 18 meters long, with articulated body, the others the 12-meter long version. In 2019, 21 new trolleybuses arrived. As of 2023, there are a total of 108 Škoda-Solaris Trollino trolleybuses running in Budapest.

====Former types====
* ZiU-9: Withdrawn from service in late 2012, these Soviet-made vehicles had partial semi-low floor at the rear. The age of fleet was 28–34 years, and the vehicles suffered from rust as well as degraded insulation of the electric drive system.
* Ikarus 435T: Ikarus 435 articulated body equipped with Kiepe electronics. The last remaining vehicles were taken out of service in February and March 2023, with one vehicle reserved for historical purposes.
* Gräf&amp;Stift MAN NGE-152: Low-floor, articulated trolley buses bought used from the city of Eberswalde to replace the aging ZiU fleet. The last remaining vehicles were taken out of service in March 2023.

===Trams===

====Present fleet====

* ICS: Abbreviation of &quot;Ipari Csuklós&quot; (English: &quot;Industrial Articulated&quot;), built by Ganz between 1967 and 1978 in Hungary, long, high-floor, double-articulated, 8 axle tram. Nowadays, they run exclusively single, but before the modern Combino trams, they ran in pairs on lines 4 and 6. Similarly narrow-bodied as the UV type, they can be used on any BKV tram route. The name &quot;Industrial&quot; was used to distinguish the trams from the earlier &quot;Home-made&quot; articulated trams (commonly known as &quot;Bengáli&quot;, no longer in service), as these trams were made by the Ganz-MÁVAG factories, unlike the Bengális, which were made by FVV (&quot;Fővárosi Villamosvasút&quot;, in English: &quot;Capital Tram Railway&quot;), BKV&#x27;s predecessor.
* KCSV-7: 30 ICS trams were re-bodied and rebuilt by Ganz-Ansaldo between 1997 and 1999, with passenger compartment heating and modernized engines. KCSV stands for Közúti Csuklós Villamos&quot; or Korszerűsített Csuklós Villamos&quot; (English: &quot;Articulated Tram for Public Road&quot; or &quot;Modernized Articulated Tram&quot;)

* ČKD Tatra T5C5: Made in Czechoslovakia from 1978 to 1984, long, high-floor trams. They mostly run in pairs, apart from lines 1 and 14, where they run in triples. They are comfortable but their wider superstructure limits the lines they can serve. Nowadays, there are only a small number of these trams in their original form as most have been refurbished throughout the years. The original trams only operate on line 1.
* ČKD-BKV T5C5K, T5C5K2, T5C5K2M: From 2002 to 2004, 80 T5C5 trams went under refurbishment and were suited with up-to-date electronics, the white interior was repainted orange, and domestically made FOK-GYEM displays (flip-disc technology) were installed on the front of the trams. These displays were also installed inside the trams, and were equipped with an audible information system. Additional door opening buttons were installed inside, and on the outside of the tram. The model number of these trams became T5C5K, (the &quot;K&quot; stands for &quot;korszerűsített&quot;, in English&quot;: modernized&quot;) and were not compatible with older T5C5 trams. From 2009 to 2013, these refurbished trams began to be equipped with automatic door closing, which was especially useful during winter to keep the trams warm. These trams became T5C5K2, and were neither compatible with T5C5 or T5C5K trams. Starting in 2014, the majority of the original, not yet refurbished trams, and the already refurbished, but outdated trams started to be refurbished. The electronics were improved even more from the original T5C5K, and T5C5K2, the interior was repainted in favor of a more tame, white-yellow color scheme. The outdated and often buggy FOK-GYEM displays were replaced by somewhat more modern dot-matrix displays. The trams were also equipped with BKV&#x27;s FUTÁR system, which allowed the tram to communicate with BKK, and replace the displayed information on-the-fly, if needed. These newly refurbished trams became T5C5K2M, and were compatible with the older T5C5K2s, but not with the T5C5Ks or the T5C5s. The trams continued to be refurbished, and from 2016 onward, tinted windows were installed. Finally, from October 2022, apart from four trams reserved for historical purposes, all trams will be refurbished to be T5C5K2Ms. 
* Duewag TW 6000: Manufactured in West Germany between 1972 and 1973, very high floor trams, purchased in 2002 refurbished from the city of Hannover. These 28 meter (91.9 ft) long vehicles only run as singles and are noted for their extremely quiet run (which did cause some minor accidents initially). Originally designed to serve as light-rail trains, the TW6000 vehicles have a variable door-well feature, which could serve tram stops in a step-free entry configuration. This feature is much appreciated by pregnant mothers and the elderly, but so far no money has been found to build the elevated platforms required to support it.
* Siemens Combino Supra: Redesigned (constructed of steel instead of the originally proposed aluminium) version of the previously controversial Siemens Combino, made in 2005–2007 in Austria, fully ultra low floor trams of a special, 54 meter (177.2 ft) long, six module design (intended only for Budapest). Up until the arrival of the newer, CAF Urbos 3 trams of Budapest, they were the longest passenger trams of the world. Currently servicing lines 4 and 6, with some servicing line 1 but only on weekends.
*CAF Urbos 3: After a dispute over the contract for new Budapest trams between Škoda and CAF, the latter company won the tender to supply the trams for Budapest. 37 were originally ordered, but this was increased to 47. There was also an option of a further 77 trams. 35 of the trams are 5-section 34 metre long trams for lines 3, 17 and 19, while 12 are 56 metre 9-section trams for line 1. The first arrived in Budapest in March 2015, and all were delivered by Summer 2016. The first 34-meter version entered service on line 3 in September 2015, with the first 56-meter version to entering service in March 2016 on line 1. In 2019, 26 new trams arrived, five 56-meter versions for line 1 and 21 34-meter versions, originally intended to be on lines 50 and 59/59A, but later operated on lines 17 and 19 instead. In 2022, of the remaining 51 trams, 20 were purchased, and will arrive starting summer 2024. Finally in February 2023, a government decision led to BKK purchasing the remaining 31 trams. The 54-meter versions currently operate on line 1 exclusively, with the 34-meter versions operating on lines 3, 14, 17, 19, 42, 50, 59, 59A, 61 and 69, as of July 2023.

====Former types====
* UV, (Series &quot;U&quot;, remote controlled &quot;távVezérelt&quot;): built domestically during 1956–1965, based on pre-World War II designs and without heating. These cars were quite popular among tram enthusiasts of the world. When BKV celebrated its 50 years of service, an elaborate &quot;UV Day&quot; parade was one of the items. They usually ran in pairs, or pairs sandwiching a trailer (some of which were built in 1939). These cars were narrower than many of the later types, so that they fit the whole network including some tunnels. Despite this, they were taken out of service in 2007, as the new Combino trams replaced the ICS trams operating on lines 4 and 6, which freed them and allowed them to operate on lines where the very outdated UV trams ran.

===Other trains===

*Cogwheel Railway: 1970s era red carriages built by SGP of Austria are currently in service, but civil organizations are pushing for their replacement as well as the reconstruction of the entire track, which is unlikely to happen in near future, because of the cost.
*MFAV (&quot;Milleniumi Földalatti Vasút,&quot; in English&quot;: Millennium Underground Railway&quot;): Domestically built double-articulated carriages from 1973 that run exclusively on line M1. Loosely based on the above-mentioned ICS tram technology, they feature three small carriages per set, in a fully low floor configuration. Likely to be replaced in the near future, MFAV vehicles are noted for high maintenance requirements, dictated by the cramped engine nacelles (needed to fit the tiny 100-year-old tunnel).
*Underground: Until 2013, both lines M2 and M3 were served by 81-717/714 and Ev/Ev3/EvA 5- or 6-carriage trains of Soviet origin. These Mytishchi Factory-built metro vehicles were noisy, consumed too much power and showed a lot of wear after 25+ years of service. Nine trains were refurbished from 2000 to 2003, which gave these carriages a pink interior and aforementioned FOK-GYEM displays inside, and on the carriages, but this did not significantly improve passenger comfort. As a result, BKV bought 37 Alstom Metropolis carriages for the lines M2 and M4. There were some problems about the delivery, and in March 2010, BKV CEO István Kocsis declared that BKV may cancel the contract with Alstom because of so many delays and problems (the new carriages should have been serving on line M2 since February 2009, but they weren&#x27;t yet). All soviet trains older than 30 years old (in total 43 carriages) were withdrawn from service after a serious fire broke out on line M3 which had no fatalities, but the first two carriages of the train were destroyed. (A peculiarity is that most of the withdrawn carriages were of a different type than the destroyed train, and a large quantity of them were already refurbished.) The Alstom Metropolis trains soon got the go ahead begin testings in the summer of 2012. The first train entered service on September 7, 2012 on line M2. All of the old Soviet-built metro trains on line M2 were taken out of service on April 30, 2013. Some of these were transferred to line M3 to increase capacity, but most were scrapped. All Soviet-built trains were heavily refurbished from 2016 to 2017 by Metrowagonmash. They were repainted black and white, earning the nickname &quot;Panda&quot;, the original bench-style seats were replaced in favor of separate seats, the interior was repainted from green to white, the door-opening mechanism was replaced with a more modern one, digital LED screen were installed that display the next stations and transfer options, the control panel was also replaced completely, separators were installed between the carriages and the front of the trains were redesigned. These trains got the model number 81-717.2K/714.2K. The trains barely resembled the original ones and were originally criticized if they were even refurbished or if Metrowagonmash had just sent back new trains. In the beginning of the refurbished carriages&#x27; operation, they were very problematic. As a result, in June 2017, BKV announced, that they had submitted a severance pay demand fee of 800 million HUF ($2,343,454 USD as of 07/23). They demanded the immediate fix of said problems. In February 2019, with no result, BKV filed a lawsuit against Metrowagonmash, now demanding 6 billion HUF ($17,575,902 USD as of 07/23). In January 2020, one of the first carriages that was refurbished had to be taken out of service, as the floor panel had gotten so rusty, that BKV was afraid it was going to give in. This had to be repaired free of charge, with compensation paid by Metrowagonmash, but as they didn&#x27;t pay, the lawsuit continued. The documents regarding the lawsuit were sent out in 2019 to the Russian Ministry of Justice, but Metrowagonmash only received it in June 2023. With this, BKV will be demanding 14 billion HUF ($41,020,832 as of 07/23) from Metrovagonmash.

===Miscellaneous vehicles===
* Massive yellow-blue trucks and orange-painted lorries are used by BKV to repair overhead wires. They are equipped with blue rotating lights and sirens and are thus authorized to ignore road traffic regulations when dealing with an emergency.
* Orange minivans and white Renault trucks are used to repair buses on site, these only have orange warning lights.

==Livery and colours==
BKV paints its vehicles different colours by type.
* Trams: yellow
* HÉV vehicles: green and white
* Trolleybuses: red
* Buses: sky blue
* Night buses: sky blue (black on timetable)
Originally the buses had a dark shade of blue, most of the vehicles were repainted in the mid-2010s to match the today used lighter blue shade. With the removal of the old Ikarus buses from the roads of Budapest, this older, darker blue has disappeared from Budapest.

The four metro lines are marked on the map in different colours:
* M1: yellow
* M2: red
* M3: blue
* M4: green

The current livery of the trains on the M2, M3 and M4 lines are white-black, on M1 vehicles are painted yellow, though until recently the trains on M2 and M3 lines were blue (shade between the buses&#x27; former and current color).

==Corruption scandal==
In 2009-2010 investigations into corruption led the police examine all money logs and contracts of the 20-year period individually, to find issues unrelated to the already detected ones. Many high-level employees and independent or in-company participants were arrested and sentenced. This issue led the owner, the Local Government of the Capital City making BKV accept a new Company Inner Regulation System and its assembly enacting local government degrees guaranteeing complete transparency in the contracts, billings, and job descriptions for the owner, and for all representatives of its assembly even individually. This regulation was extended to all enterprises owned in majority by the city council.

==In popular culture==
A surrealistic thriller titled &quot;Kontroll&quot; was filmed in the M2 and M3 metro tunnels during 2002–2003. The movie has won several awards and has developed a cult following. The ironic beginning of the movie features Botond Aba, former CEO of BKV, who declares that all events and locations shown in the film are purely fictional.

<text>Adam Craig Parore (born 23 January 1971) is a former wicket-keeper and batsman for the New Zealand cricket team. He played 78 Test cricket matches for New Zealand and 179 One Day International cricket matches. Parore has been the managing director of financial services firm Adam Parore Mortgages. CoinHQ was also founded by him. Parore was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

==International career==
He was the first Māori to represent New Zealand in cricket.

He also holds the record for the highest One Day International innings score without a boundary (96 vs India, in Baroda, 1994).

After representing New Zealand for more than a decade, Parore retired from international cricket, his last Test match played against England in Auckland in 2002. He finished with 204 Test dismissals, a New Zealand record.

==Personal life==
In 2003 he began a relationship with socialite and television presenter Sally Ridge, with whom he had two children, and ran a sports clothing company. Ridge and Parore were involved in a controversial house demolition when they wanted to demolish a 100-year-old house and replace it with a new building.

In 2006, Parore started his own business, Adam Parore Mortgages as a mortgage broker.

In 2009 the couple were embroiled in a $1 million leaky homes lawsuit. They broke up in 2010.

In May 2011 he climbed Mount Everest, the only Test cricketer to do so.

In March 2014 he married 22-year-old Miller Rose MacLeod-McGhie in Hokianga. The couple reportedly separated in 2016.

<doc id="1004276" wikidata="Q1068196" url="?curid=1004276" title="Chatham albatross">
<text>The Chatham albatross (Thalassarche eremita), also known as the Chatham mollymawk or Chatham Island mollymawk, is a medium-sized black-and-white albatross which breeds only on The Pyramid, a large rock stack in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand (Aotearoa). It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the shy albatross &quot;Thalassarche cauta&quot;. It is the smallest of the shy albatross group.

==Taxonomy==
Mollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.

The Chatham albatross, with the white-capped, shy and Salvin&#x27;s albatrosses, were all considered the same species until a 1998 book by Robertson and Nunn. Other experts followed suit, with BirdLife International in 2000, Brooke in 2004, ACAP in 2006, and SACC in 2008. Though some, such as James Clements, did not agree.

The Chatham albatross was first described as &quot;Diomedea cauta eremita&quot; by Robert Cushman Murphy, in 1930, based on a specimen from Pyramid Rock.

==Description==
The Chatham albatross weighs and it has a length of . The adult has a dark grey crown, face, upper mantle, back, upperwing, tail, and throat. They have a white rump and underparts. They also have a black thumbmark on the leading edge of the underwings, and a black tip on the wings. Their bill is yellow with a dark spot on the tip of the lower mandible. Finally, they have an orange cheek stripe. The juveniles have more extensive grey and their bill is blue-grey with black tips on both mandibles.

==Behaviour==

They are normally silent, but will emit a harsh buzzing bray when threatened and also during courtship. Besides the sound they will put on a courtship display which includes fanning of the tail, mutual jousting of bills, and grunting.

===Feeding===
The Chatham albatross feeds on fish, cephalopods, krill, and barnacles.

===Reproduction===
This species of albatross breeds annually on rocky ledges, steep slopes, and crevices. They build pedestal nests of soil and vegetation. At this time The Pyramid is their only breeding site. They lay their single egg between 20 August and 1 October, with the egg hatching in November or December, after 68–72 days. The chicks fledge by March or April, or 130 to 140 days after hatching. Juveniles return to the colony after four years, but do not breed until their seventh year. 

==Range and habitat==
The Chatham albatross nests only on The Pyramid in the Chatham Islands. Using aerial photography, in 1998, scientists estimated that there were between 3,200 and 4,200 pairs nesting. Ground counts from 1999 to 2003 increased this number to 5,300 pairs for a total of approximately 11,000 breeding age birds. When not breeding they range in the South Pacific from Tasmania to Chile and Peru. From April to July they will utilize the Humboldt Current and go as far north as 6°S along the South American coast.

==Conservation==
The IUCN has classified this species as Vulnerable, due to the fact that they nest on one small island, which has undergone significant decline in habitat condition. In 1985 a severe storm impacted the island by reducing the amount of vegetation. The conditions have been improving since 1998. As with other albatrosses, commercial fishing impacts their survival, with longline and the occasional trawl line. Illegal harvesting of chicks occurs occasionally.

In 2014, the Chatham Islands Taiko Trust translocated 50 juvenile albatrosses to a protected breeding site on Main Chatham Island, some 50 km north of the Pyramid. It was hoped that a new colony could be established within five years which would give the species a chance to thrive in less extreme conditions. In total 300 chicks were trans-located over the period 2014 to 2018. Each day during the period of the project, 60KG of a squid and fish mixture was prepared, warmed and fed, to the chicks by volunteers of the Chatham Island Taiko Trust. The success or the translocation project is not yet confirmed. The birds, once they depart the colony, spend five to seven years at sea. If the birds return to nest on the new location this will provide an indication of the projects&#x27; success.

<text>Marlow Bridge is a road traffic and foot bridge over the River Thames in England between the town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire and the village of Bisham in Berkshire. It crosses the Thames just upstream of Marlow Lock, on the reach to Temple Lock. The bridge is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
There has been a bridge on the site since the reign of King Edward III which was stated in around 1530 to have been of timber, though an original crossing to the Knights Templar of Bisham may date from 1309. In 1642 this bridge was partly destroyed by a Parliamentarian army. In 1789 a new timber bridge was built by public subscription with a contribution from the Thames Navigation Commission to increase the headroom underneath. The current suspension bridge was designed by William Tierney Clark and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828. The Széchenyi Chain Bridge, spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Tierney Clark and it is a larger scale version of Marlow bridge.

In 1965, the bridge was restored. It has a 3 tonne weight restriction and is used only by foot and local road traffic. Other traffic is carried by the Marlow By-pass Bridge. On 24 September 2016, a 37-tonne Lithuanian haulage lorry attempted to pass over the bridge, requiring it to be closed for two months to allow Buckinghamshire County Council to undertake a series of stress tests on the suspension bridge hangers and pins, together with ultrasound and magnetic particle tests. No significant damage to the bridge was found, and it was reopened on Friday 25 November following restoration of sections exposed for weld testing with three coats of paint, removal of scaffolding surrounding the bridge&#x27;s two towers, and reinstatement of timber work removed for inspection.

<doc id="1004295" wikidata="Q7610473" url="?curid=1004295" title="Stephen Saunders (British Army officer)">
<text>Brigadier Stephen William John Saunders (26 July 1947 – 8 June 2000) was a British Army officer who, while serving as the British military attaché in Athens, was assassinated by members of the Greek urban guerrilla Marxist 
organization Revolutionary Organization 17 November (17N).

==Early life and military career==
Saunders was born in Farnborough, Hampshire, the son of a British Army officer. Educated at Peter Symonds School, Winchester, he joined the British Army in 1965 and was commissioned into the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Regiment having completed his officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

From October 1968 he spent three years reading for an in-service degree in Geography and Economics at the University of Bristol. On returning to his battalion, he served in Berlin, Cyprus, Northern Ireland and West Germany, before attending the Staff College, Camberley in 1981. His first staff appointment was at HQ Northern Ireland.

Saunders returned to his battalion, and served for a spell with the United Nations in Cyprus. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1986 and, after serving on the staff at HQ United Kingdom Land Forces, commanded his battalion in Northern Ireland, for which he was mentioned in despatches, and then Hong Kong. During his two years in Hong Kong, he took part in training exercises in Malaysia, South Korea, Hawaii and Australia.

He then joined the British military training scheme in Zimbabwe, lending assistance to the Zimbabwe National Army. On promotion to colonel in 1992, he was posted as Deputy Commander, Headquarters 8th Infantry Brigade in Derry, his service during this tour earning him the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Valuable Service. From 1993 to 1996 he was military attaché on the British defence liaison team in Canberra and a defence adviser in Papua New Guinea.

In 1997, he was posted to Kuwait and spent a year as Military Assistant to the Force Commander United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission.

==Assassination and investigation==
Saunders was attacked and shot dead by two men on a motorcycle while driving through Athens traffic on his way to work at the British Embassy at 07:48 on 8 June 2000. 17 November (17N) claimed responsibility for the killing in a proclamation dated March 2000 and published in Eleftherotypia on 9 June 2000. The group charged, falsely, that Saunders was an RAF wing commander involved in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In fact he was a British Army brigadier with broad peacekeeping experience completely unconnected with the Kosovo War.

17N revealed in a second proclamation dated 11 December 2000, also published in Eleftherotypia, that it had erroneously believed Saunders&#x27;s embassy-issued white Rover was armoured. Therefore, the killers used a Heckler &amp; Koch G3 assault rifle they had stolen from a Greek police station in August 1988. That gun jammed after one shot, and the killer[s] fired four more shots with a .45 Colt M1911 pistol. Saunders died in the hospital 2 hours later.

Witnesses told police they saw a shorter man behind a taller man, both helmeted, on a white Enduro motorcycle. Police recovered a stolen green Modenas Kris 111cc scooter with stolen licence plates parked nearby.

The investigation that followed was driven by an unprecedented level of co-operation between Greek and UK Police services, with support from the U.S. FBI and CIA. Scotland Yard provided training and sent Greek-speaking police officers to compile and restudy the fragmentary evidence compiled since 17N began its operations in 1975. Heather Saunders made a highly effective televised appeal for help in finding the murderers. Family members of 17N victims formed an advocacy group Os Edo (Ως Εδώ – &quot;Enough&quot; [literally: &quot;Up to Here&quot;]) that lobbied for a tougher Greek anti-terrorism law, passed as Law 2928/2001.

The investigation identified suspects for membership in 17N but produced no evidence usable in court. On 29 June 2002, 17N member Savvas Xiros (hitherto unknown to police) was gravely injured when a time bomb he was planting exploded prematurely in Piraeus. He agreed to confess that he had driven the scooter, with fellow member Dimitris Koufodinas carrying the G3. Before the 2003 trial of 19 suspected members of 17N, Xiros retracted his confession. Both he and Koufodinas were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. An activist against the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 named Alexandros Giotopoulos, living underground under the pseudonym Mihalis Oikonomou since 1971, was convicted as 17N&#x27;s leader and thus the moral instigator of the murder, while Savvas&#x27;s brother Vasilis was convicted as the accomplice who helped preposition the vehicles.

==Further claims==
In his 2009 memoir &quot;Reluctant Spy&quot; (Bantam), former CIA officer John Kiriakou wrote of driving past Saunders&#x27;s blood-stained car the morning of 8 June. He claimed that the reason for his abrupt departure from Greece in August 2000 was the discovery that Greek urban guerrilla organization 17N had been stalking him instead of Saunders. He quoted the 17N proclamation taking responsibility for the Saunders murder: &quot;We saw the big spy, but he was in an armored car and we knew that he was armed. So we elected to carry out the sentence on the war criminal Saunders&quot;. (p83) 

One of many attempts to implicate the U.S. government as the sponsor of 17N appeared in December 2005, when Kleanthis Grivas published an article in &quot;To Proto Thema&quot;, a Greek Sunday newspaper. He claimed that &quot;Sheepskin&quot;, the Greek version of Gladio, NATO&#x27;s stay-behind paramilitary capability during the Cold War, carried out the assassination of CIA station chief Richard Welch in Athens in 1975 and also the assassination of Stephen Saunders more than a decade after the Cold War ended. This charge was denied by the US State Department, who responded that &quot;the Greek terrorist organization &#x27;17 November&#x27; was responsible for both assassinations&quot;, and noted that Grivas&#x27;s central piece of evidence was a disinformation document of Soviet origin (the so-called &quot;Westmoreland Field Manual&quot;) which the State department, as well as a Congressional inquiry had dismissed as a Soviet forgery. The documents make no specific mention of Greece, 17N, nor Welch. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, &quot;Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials&quot; as well as the Greek government&#x27;s statements to the effect that the &quot;stay behind&quot; network had been dismantled in 1988.

==Legacy==
Saunders was buried with a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone in the churchyard of the parish church of Melbury Osmond, Dorset, close to where he had previously lived. His life is commemorated by a memorial stone set in the floor of St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Athens and a plaque on the memorial wall at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Since 2001 St. Catherine&#x27;s British School in Athens has been awarding the Stephen Saunders Award for Good Citizenship to a pupil with outstanding contribution to school life, society and the support of others.

<text>Pelaaja (&quot;Gamer&quot;) is a Finnish video games magazine published 11 times a year by H-Town. &quot;Pelaaja&quot; turned 15 years old in 2017. Pelaaja covers both PCs and consoles, although between 2003 and 2007 it focused only on consoles. During that time the PC coverage was in a separate magazine named &quot;PCPelaaja&quot;, now defunct. Its editor-in-chief was Miika Huttunen, who was a former editor-in-chief of Pelaaja.

==History and profile==
&quot;Pelaaja&quot; was started by 2002. The longest running editor-in-chief of Pelaaja was Thomas Puha. Its current editor-in-chief is Miika Huttunen, a veteran of the Finnish electronic gaming scene and among the permanent staff is Janne Pyykkönen, who is also the editor-in-chief of H-Town&#x27;s &quot;Pelaa!&quot; magazine. The art director is Lasse Erkola and some of the frequent collaborators include Miikka Lehtonen, Tero Lehtiniemi and Jukka O. Kauppinen.

The magazine is more akin to European and American videogames magazines than Finnish ones with its focus on exclusive coverage on the latest games and extensive interviews with members of the development community. Game reviews are also a big part of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s tagline is &quot;for the love of gaming&quot; as the magazine&#x27;s staff are hardcore gaming enthusiasts, which is evident in the passionate writing of the magazine features. The magazine was started because the people working on the magazine felt there was no high quality games magazine available in Finland which would focus on console games rather than the PC. Another feature is the international vibe of the magazine via Japan- and US- based writers contributing to the magazine.

&quot;Pelaaja&quot; focuses heavily on its art direction, which is handled by Lasse Erkola, with additional design during the years from Thomas Puha. The magazine was redesigned in summer of 2005 and re-launched in October 2005. Another redesign coincided with the magazine&#x27;s 10th anniversary issue #121 in October 2012. PC games also made a return to the magazine during this redesign.

Puha and Huttunen are known to cable television and public broadcasting channel viewing audiences for both their games related program appearances and their program featuring neat webpages.

<doc id="1004299" wikidata="Q5523805" url="?curid=1004299" title="Garrat Elections">
<text>The Garrat Elections were a carnival of mock elections in Wandsworth, Surrey (now part of London), England in the 18th century. The events were organized around 20 May and would see crowds of tens of thousands travelling from London to take part. The elections were held for at least fifty years before declining after the death of Mayor &quot;Sir&quot; Harry Dimsdale in 1796.

&quot;Grose&#x27;s Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,&quot; originally published in 1785 by Francis Grose, described the Garrat Election as:
==History==
In the 17th century, Garrat was a small hamlet in the parish of Wandsworth. Its residents had met in a conclave and elected a &quot;commons&quot; president to exert authority over a small common. They felt that the president should hold the office of &quot;mayor&quot; during the parliamentary period between general elections and should be re-elected with the new one. The minor political spectacle aroused some amusement and locals ended up parodying the affair in their mock election.

The Garrat &quot;elections&quot; were chaired at Garratt Lane, and were popular events, with up to 80,000 attendees and sponsorship from local innkeepers and pub keepers who profited from the occasion. People put forth unusual candidates to parody the features of the real election, with the successful candidate being &quot;the most deformed and stupid&quot;. Candidates would deliver speeches with promises and appeals to sentiment, making pledges such as &quot;that they will lower the prices of gin, bread, beer, &amp;c.; make old women bishops; and that they will not accept any place in the House&quot;.

The fame of the Garratt elections was spread by Samuel Foote&#x27;s 1763 farce, &quot;The Mayor of Garret&quot;, and from 1768 candidates often came from London and its surroundings rather than just the Wandsworth area.

After the death of Mayor Harry Dimsdale towards the end of the 18th century, the festival began to lose its drive and innkeepers no longer agreed to pay the expenses. An 1826 attempt to revive the event failed.

==Mayors and candidates==

There is no record of the identity of the candidates before 1747. At that particular year, the &quot;clerk and recorder&quot; from a nonexistent town hall issued notification of election between &quot;Squire Blowmedown&quot; and &quot;Squire Gubbins&quot; (waterman and pubkeeper, respectively, in their day-to-day jobs). Both candidates gave out handbills where they praised their own merits and mocked those of their opponent, imitating political leaflets of the day. Same two candidates attended the next election in 1754, again abusing each other and their supporters in their handbills.

Year 1761 saw the number of candidates rise to nine; in addition to previous two there were &quot;Sir John Crambo&quot;, &quot;Kit Noisy&quot; (waterman), &quot;Lord Lapstone&quot; (shoemaker), &quot;Lord Paxford&quot;, &quot;Lord Twankum&quot; (cobbler), &quot;Lord Wedge&quot; and &quot;Beau Silvester&quot;. The candidates elicited flowering elocutions praising their own efforts, promising prosperity if they were to be elected and threatening impending disaster if their opponents should be elected instead. Beau Silvester merited himself with resisting the extra tax on ale and giving orders to increase the number of local pubs.

In 1763 candidates Lord Twankum, Kit Noisy and Sir John Crambo mocked each other in electoral contest. In 1768 there were seven candidates; Lord Twankum, &quot;Sir Christopher Dashem&quot;, &quot;Sir George Comefirst&quot;, &quot;Sir William Airey&quot;, &quot;Sir William Bellows&quot;, one &quot;Batt from the Workhouse&quot;, and &quot;Sir John Harper&quot; who ended up being the most popular in the following elections. Lady Twankum promised an opulent party for the entertainment of the populace. 1775 election introduced &quot;Sir William Blaize&quot;, &quot;Nephew to the late Lord Twankum&quot; and &quot;Sir Christopher Dashem&quot;.

The 1781 election again had nine candidates; old hands Sir John Harper, Sir Christopher Dashwood, and Sir William Blaize and the new ones &quot;Sir Buggy Bates&quot; (chimney-sweep), &quot;Sir John Gnawpost&quot;, &quot;Sir Thomas Nameless&quot;, &quot;Sir William Swallowtail&quot; (basketmaker), &quot;Sir Thomas Tubbs&quot; (waterman) and &quot;Sir Jeffrey Dunstan&quot; (wigseller). The latter proved to be the most popular ever in the following elections due to his wit, small size and grotesque and unkempt appearance. Swallowtail had come to the poll in a wicker-chariot of his own design and preceded by hand-bell players. Dashwood was pulled around in a boat. Swallowtail and Buggy Bates were blamed of having government contracts, of baskets and soot, respectively. Sir John Harper and Sir Jeffrey Dunstan were &quot;returned to parliament&quot;.

In 1785 elections Sir Jeffrey Dunstan was left without opposition when Sir John Harper died. In 1796 the new candidate &quot;Sir Harry Dimsdale&quot; won but he died before the next election.

<doc id="1004300" wikidata="Q1870447" url="?curid=1004300" title="Los Angeles City Council">
<text>The Los Angeles City Council is the lawmaking body for the city government of Los Angeles, California, the second largest city in the United States. It has 15 members who each represent the 15 city council districts that are spread throughout the city&#x27;s 501 square miles of land.

The head of the city council is the president, who presides over meetings of the council, gives assignments to city council committees, handles parliamentary duties, and serves as acting mayor of Los Angeles when the mayor is unable to perform their duties. The current President is Marqueece Harris-Dawson from the 8th district. The current president pro tempore is Bob Blumenfield from the 3rd district. The assistant president pro tempore position is Nithya Raman from the 4th district.

As a nonpartisan council, the city council does not have a majority or minority leader, but the council is currently controlled by a Democratic majority with one Independent. The city council has been nonpartisan since the passage of the 1909 city charter.

Council members are elected every four years, with the city council redistricting every ten years based on the previous United States census. Elections happen concurrently with other local and national elections, doing so since 2020.
== Composition ==
=== Council leaders ===
=== Current members ===
== Salary ==
Members of the City Council earn $218,000 per year, the highest salary in the nation, due to a decision to make elected officials&#x27; salary equal with the salary of municipal judges.

City councilmembers can have their salary rescinded if they are suspended from the City Council. The Council can also control who can get pay if a member is suspended; when Mark Ridley-Thomas&#x27;s pay was suspended by City Controller Ron Galperin after his suspension from the Council, his pay was reinstated after a council vote as he was not indicted. The decision was then reversed by Galperin&#x27;s successor, Kenneth Mejia.

== Law ==

The Los Angeles City Council is guided by the Los Angeles City Charter. The Charter defines the City Council as the city&#x27;s legislature, with the Mayor of Los Angeles serving as the executive branch of the city&#x27;s government creating a strong mayor–council government, though the mayor is weaker than in cities such as New York City. The City Council approves department heads and commissioners picked by the Mayor, amends or approves the Mayor&#x27;s annual budget, and approve the Mayor&#x27;s local emergencies to which it reviews afterwards.

The Charter also gives powers for redistricting, as the City Council picks some of the members on the charter commission to advise the council on redistricting but with the City Council having the ability to overrule the commission.

The City Council also has a direct line of communication between it and the 99 local Neighborhood Councils, which serve as advisory groups for the officials.

== History ==
=== Los Angeles Common Council (1850–1889) ===

Before the incorporation of Los Angeles in 1850, members (&quot;regidores&quot;) of a municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) were chosen by the residents of each pueblo since 1812, with the number of &quot;regidores&quot; being based on the population. By 1835, the new city had four &quot;regidores&quot;, alongside two &quot;Alcaldes&quot; (Mayor) and one &quot;Síndico Procurador&quot; (City Attorney). On April 4, 1850, the Los Angeles Common Council was established alongside the office of Mayor under The Act of Incorporation as the city grew from a remote town of 5,000 residents to a city of 15,000 residents. At its creation, the council had seven seats elected at-large with the members being elected by drawn lots. In 1857, the officials that were elected on May 6 were deposed and the officials from the previous year were reinstated, though they never took office. The council added three seats in 1868.

On July 14, 1870, the council switched to a ward system with three new wards with three seats. The Third ward added a fourth seat in 1871, three years before the First and Second wards added a fourth seat. In 1878, the First and Second wards removed the fourth seat while the third ward removed it in 1881. In 1878, the council created two new wards, the Fourth and Fifth wards, each with three new seats. By the end of the first ward system, the council had fifteen seats.

The councilmembers had various responsibilities for governing the city which included being appointed to committees, which included a school committee which later became the Board of Education for the Los Angeles City School District and later the Los Angeles Unified School District. The office of the President of the Los Angeles City Council was also part of the Council&#x27;s creation, with the first President being David W. Alexander.

=== Creation of Los Angeles City Council and second ward system (1889–1909) ===
In 1888, voters in Los Angeles passed a new charter that changed the government. The Common Council was now called the City Council and had nine seats for nine new wards. Members were elected to two year terms beginning in 1890, with one member being elected from each of the nine wards by a plurality vote. The change was granted by the California State Legislature, with the first election being in August 1889. The first election under that charter was held on February 21, 1889, and the last on December 4, 1906. Only Austin Conrad Shafer of the 5th ward was re-elected to the new City Council.

During the ward system, the City Council requested the annexation of six parts of the adjacent area: Garvanza, the University area, Colegrove, the shoestring area, Wilmington, and San Pedro.

=== Second at-large system (1909–1925) ===
By 1909, the ward system was leading to corruption within the city council and its elections, and various newspapers suggested that the City Council have ten seats and five at-large seats, resulting in fifteen seats total, or moving to an at-large system. That year, voters replaced the ward system with an at-large system through the Direct Municipal Primary law. They also voted to adjust the party system to have all offices become nonpartisan.

In the first election, candidates were labeled as part of the Good Government Organization, created by political boss Meyer Lissner, or part of the &quot;political machine&quot; with S. P. Yoke, as the city had installed a new nonpartisan election system. In 1923, candidates were either a part of the Municipal Conference, also organized by Lissner, the People&#x27;s Campaign Committee, the Socialist Party of America, or independent.

In 1915, journalist Estelle Lawton Lindsey was elected to the City Council, being the first female City Councilmember in the City Council just four years after women had voted in municipal elections for the first time. She would be the only woman to serve during this system as well as the only woman to serve in the City Council until the election of Rosalind Wiener Wyman in 1953.

=== Creation of fifteen-member council (1925–2000) ===

On July 1, 1925, Los Angeles voters passed a new city charter and replaced the at-large system with a district system with fifteen new single-member districts. Each district was to be approximately equal in population, based upon the voting in the 1922 California gubernatorial election, and would redistrict every four years. The numbering system established for the City Council districts began with the 1st district in the San Fernando Valley and ended with the 15th district in the Los Angeles Harbor Region. In 1928, the new Los Angeles City Hall was completed, and the City Council moved to a room there from the previous Romanesque Revival building used.

By 1986, the City Council was under a court ruling to redistrict itself to provide more representation for Latinos in the city. On August 12, 1986, Councilman Howard Finn died, leaving the 1st district vacant, and the City Council and residents debated how the districts would be redrawn. The City Council voted to have the 1st district drawn to be northwest and north of Downtown Los Angeles while the 2nd district, represented by Joel Wachs, was placed in the Sunland-Tujunga and Van Nuys areas. In 1993, voters approved the adoption of term limits for the City Council, with the new limits being eight years of elected service.

After the creation of the fifteen-member council, politicians who were not white men increasingly were elected to it. On July 1, 1949, Edward R. Roybal became the first Latino American elected to the City Council. On January 28, 1963, Gilbert W. Lindsay became the first African-American to serve on the Council, being appointed to serve out Roybal&#x27;s term after the latter was elected to Congress. On April 16, 1963, the first elected African-American on the Council, Tom Bradley, was sworn in, which also gave the Council a Democratic majority for the first time in recent history. On July 1, 1985, Michael Woo was sworn in, the first Asian American to serve on the Council. On February 3, 1987, Gloria Molina was sworn in as the first Latina elected to the Council.

=== Strong mayor-council system (2000–present) ===

In 1999, voters approved a new city charter that would go into effect on July 1, 2000. The new charter helped create the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment and helped strengthen the office of Mayor in relation to the City Council. Voters also voted against expanding the city council, remaining with fifteen seats. In 2006, voters approved a ballot measure that changed the term limits from eight years to twelve years.

In 2015, voters in Los Angeles approved a charter amendment to move the election dates from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, in line with other national elections, in an effort to boost political engagement. Because of the change in dates, officials elected in 2015 or 2017 had their terms extended. In 2022, after a highly publicized scandal involving three City Council members (including Council President Nury Martinez) and the redistricting process, Acting President Mitch O&#x27;Farrell introduced a motion that would create a ballot measure in 2024 to expand the Council. In 2023, the first all-female council committee was formed, with the six women on the council forming the committee. In November 2022, the Ad Hoc Committee on City Governance Reform was formed, chaired by the next President Paul Krekorian, to reform the redistricting process.

<doc id="1004301" wikidata="Q3814453" url="?curid=1004301" title="Ken's Labyrinth">
<text>Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth is a first-person shooter for MS-DOS published in 1993 by Epic MegaGames. It was programmed by Ken Silverman, who later designed the Build engine used for rendering in 3D Realms&#x27;s &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (1996). &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; consists of three episodes, the first of which was released as shareware. An earlier version was self-published by Silverman. In the game, the player assumes the role of a dog named Sparky trying to escape a labyrinth.

==Technology==
&quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; is graphically similar to id Software&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; in that the levels were designed using a grid-based plane, resulting in perpendicular walls and textureless floors and ceilings. Arguably its most astounding feature was the existence of interactive sprites and textures, like slot and vending machines. This move towards engines allowing greater interactivity was later elaborated upon by Silverman&#x27;s Build engine.

&quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; was released as freeware on November 16, 1999. Several different versions were released and are available for download from the official website. The source code followed on July 1, 2001.

==Game versions==
The first version is known as &quot;Walken&quot;, the version which Ken Silverman sent to companies for evaluation. This was the first version created, and therefore it had very few features. There was almost no interactivity, and the code was mostly a test.

The first version to be released was a modified version of &quot;Walken&quot; called &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;. Many changes were made, including interactivity, an early money system and music. It was sold by Ken directly, using the Advanced Systems company name, a company that Ken&#x27;s older brother Alan Silverman was involved with.

Following that was version 1.1, which featured 27 levels and an alternate final boss. New enemies, textures and music were added, as well as a money system with which the player could locate money and use it to purchase a random item from a vending machine. Slot machines were also implemented. The game was then submitted to fifteen different software companies, including Silverman&#x27;s later employer Apogee Software, which appreciated the engine but requested considerable changes to the game.

Released in March 1993 by Epic MegaGames, the final version (2.01) featured 30 levels, and many new features that older versions of the game lacked, such as the ability to choose the item purchased from the vending machines, a difficulty option (on &quot;easy&quot; mode, or &quot;Don&#x27;t hurt me&quot;, enemies do not use melee attacks, while on &quot;hard&quot; mode, or &quot;Ouch!&quot; they do), an episode select, and also new enemies, textures and music with additional artwork made by Misko Iho of Future Crew.

A &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; port to modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux using Simple DirectMedia Layer called &quot;LAB3D/SDL&quot; was created by Jan Lönnberg and released in 2002. A version of the port which includes new higher resolution textures and later adapted for SDL 2 was also created by Katie Stafford. A fork of that version also exists supporting Nintendo Switch. A modern level editor for the game by Kai E. Froland has also been produced, called KKIT/SDL.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1993 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #199 by Sandy Petersen in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

<doc id="1004311" wikidata="Q162460" url="?curid=1004311" title="Solomon Kane">
<text>Solomon Kane is a fictional character created by the pulp-era writer Robert E. Howard. A late-16th-to-early-17th century Puritan, Solomon Kane is a somber-looking man who wanders the world with no apparent goal other than to vanquish evil in all its forms. His adventures, published mostly in the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, often take him from Europe to the jungles of Africa and back.

When &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published the story &quot;Red Nails&quot;, featuring Conan the Barbarian, the editors introduced it as a tale of &quot;a barbarian adventurer named Conan, remarkable for his sheer force of valor and brute strength. Its author, Robert E. Howard, is already a favorite with the readers of this magazine for his stories of Solomon Kane, the dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs&quot;.

Solomon Kane was portrayed by James Purefoy in the film &quot;Solomon Kane&quot; in 2009. He has also been featured in a series of comics published by Marvel from 1973 to 1994 and again from 2008 to 2009.

== Personality and character ==
In his story &quot;Moon of Skulls&quot;, Robert E. Howard described Kane as &quot;He was a man born out of his time — a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan, though the last assertion would have shocked him unspeakably. An atavist of the days of blind chivalry he was, a knight errant in the somber clothes of the fanatic. A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things, avenge all crimes against right and justice.&quot;

Solomon Kane is a deeply devout Puritan. He is characterized by his fanaticism, unshakable faith, and religious zeal. His forename references King Solomon, who was righteous and wise. His morality is starkly black and white, allowing for no grey areas of uncertainty. To Kane, the wicked are wicked, and the righteous are righteous, with little between. His surname, Kane, is a reference to Cain, the Bible’s first murderer. A hint towards Kane&#x27;s dangerous nature and willingness to take other men&#x27;s lives. Like Conan the Barbarian, Kane shows a keen sense of chivalry and propriety, defending the innocent and the weak from their wicked oppressors.

Kane lives on an endless odyssey to destroy evil and darkness in the name of God Almighty. He also seems to have little regard for his own life and safety, giving away years of his life to pursue and track down evil doers who deserved punishment. He is the archetypical wandering hero, seeking no reward for his actions.

== Appearance and equipment ==
Solomon Kane is a tall, sombre, and gloomy man with pale skin, gaunt face, and cold eyes. Kane is a Puritan Englishman, of the 16th century, who is often depicted with the stereotypical garb of his time and culture. He is dressed entirely in black. He wears a slouch hat, leather gloves, riding boots, a doublet, and cloak.

Kane is proficient in many different types of weapons, and his arsenal is incredibly varied. His main weapon is a Spanish rapier, since Kane is a master duelist and swordsman. In his off-hand, he often wields a dirk, a thrusting dagger of Scottish origin. Kane is also equipped with a brace of flintlock pistols. He also, on one occasion, uses a musket.

=== The Staff of Solomon ===
During one of his later adventures, his friend N&#x27;Longa, an African shaman, gave him a juju staff for protection against evil and to be wielded as a weapon. In &quot;The Footfalls Within&quot;, it is the mythical Staff of Solomon.

It is an artifact that belonged to the Biblical monarch of Ancient Israel, Solomon. Before this, when the world was young, Atlantean and pre-Adamite priests in silent cities beneath the seas used the staff to fight evil, millions of years before mankind was born. The staff was older than the Earth and unimaginably powerful, more than even N&#x27;Longa knew. With the staff, Moses did wonders before the Pharaoh and carried it with him when his people fled Egypt. For centuries it was the Scepter of Israel (from Numbers 24:17), and Solomon used it to combat magicians or capture djinn. The staff may be Aaron&#x27;s rod, Moses&#x27; rod, or the Rod of Asclepius.

It is carved from a wood that no longer exists on Earth. The staff is covered with ancient hieroglyphs and sharply pointed at one end, with the head of a cat on the other. The cat&#x27;s head is a representation of Bast, and the priests of Bast used the staff in Ancient Egypt. The cat&#x27;s head was carved out of an unknown pre-existing decoration and was added long after the staff was created.

Using the staff, Kane can communicate over distances with N&#x27;Longa. It has also been used to slay vampires and evil spirits. Having carried it for an extended period, it has endowed Kane with the ability to sense otherworldly beings. When Kane is taken prisoner by slavers, Yussef the Hadji recognizes it and says it is older than the world itself and holds mighty magic.

==Characters==

===N&#x27;Longa===
He is an ancient shaman of pre-colonial Africa who is driven to study magic. He has traveled the world in ancient times as a slave, secretly studying under various sorcerers and holy men of the Middle and Near East. In Judea, he acquired the Staff of Solomon, which he later gave to Solomon Kane to aid him in his wanderings. N&#x27;Longa&#x27;s magical powers derive from his ability to send his spirit out of his body. He can take over the bodies of the living and dead through this method to communicate with Solomon Kane through the Staff of Solomon, and he also summons vultures by sending his spirit to parley with them.

===Le Loup===
Meaning &quot;The Wolf&quot;, Le Loup is a French criminal mastermind whom Kane spent several years tracking down to avenge the murder of a dying girl he found, and her whole village. Kane eventually tracks Le Loup to Africa, where he first meets N&#x27;Longa, and justice is served after Kane kills him in a duel.

===The Fishhawk===
His real name is Jonas Hardraker and he is known on all coasts of the civilized world as a ruthless pirate. He is a tall, rangy, broad-shouldered man, with a lean hawk-like cruel face. Solomon Kane hunted him for two years after Hardraker sank a ship that was carrying the daughter of an old friend of Kane, the old friend having gone mad after hearing of his daughter&#x27;s death. Kane finally confronted and killed Hardraker in England where Hardraker was smuggling alcohol with Sir George Banway.

== Works ==

Most of the Solomon Kane stories were first published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Some stories were first published in a collection, also entitled &quot;Red Shadows&quot;, released posthumously. The order of publication, however, does not coincide with the order in which the stories were written.

==Adaptations==
===Audio===
There are currently three audio-book recordings of Solomon Kane stories and poems, all currently available for purchase and download through Audible. There is one free audio drama production:
* &quot;The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane&quot;, an unabridged audio-book of the collected Solomon Kane stories released by Tantor Audio and narrated by Paul Boehmer, originally available on CD ().

Shooting started in Czech Republic in January 2008, with James Purefoy (&quot;Rome&quot;&#x27;s Mark Antony) as Kane. Max von Sydow plays Kane&#x27;s father, and Pete Postlethwaite, Alice Krige and Jason Flemyng are among the supporting cast. Patrick Tatopoulos, creature designer for &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and others, conceptualized the monsters Kane fights in his battles with the forces of evil. The film was released in France on December 23, 2009, in the UK on February 19, 2010 and in the US on September 28, 2012.

In addition to game rules, the book features a background and summaries of Howard&#x27;s original stories and an original adventure campaign featuring a group of wanderers following the path of Kane and revisiting places changed by Solomon&#x27;s actions. Pinnacle Entertainment Group also published several companion campaign books that expand on the Solomon Kane universe. The total roster of books include:

===Board game===
Mythic Games has developed a narrative adventure board game simply titled &quot;Solomon Kane&quot; based on Robert E. Howard&#x27;s original stories and characters. The game was funded via the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter in July 2018 and has been in development since, with initial release slated for summer 2020.

The game is a co-op style board game where players represent the virtues that drive Solomon Kane forwards in his quest against darkness. Kane&#x27;s various adventures are told in the game through one or more acts, which break down into smaller chapters of gameplay. These are scenarios with multiple possible outcomes and branching story arcs, where the players also have a chance of diverging from the original stories of Robert E. Howard and instead explore a number of &quot;what if&quot; scenarios written by Mythic Games.

===Sculptures, toys, and miniatures===
Fernando Ruiz Miniatures (FerMiniatures) sells a sculpted miniature of Solomon Kane that can be painted and displayed or used in a role-playing game. This miniature presents Kane in puritan attire, equipped with a rapier sword, a dagger, pistols and the mythical Staff of Solomon, given to him by the shaman N’Longa.

Mezco Toyz has created a Solomon Kane action figure for its One:12 Collective product line. This 17 cm action figure is outfitted in a nobleman’s shirt and vest, duster coat, adventurer pants, and Viking boots. His utility belt and removable chest harness can hold his various weapon sheaths. It also features interchangeable hair, interchangeable facial expressions, the Staff of Solomon, multiple daggers and sheaths, a flintlock pistol, and a dirk sword.

The Figures Toy Company created a toy action figure for Solomon Kane in 2014. This 8 inch figure includes a hat, sword and flintlock pistol.

Randy Bowen Designs created a cold cast bronze sculpture of Solomon Kane in 1998. It is based on the image from Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane&quot;. The statue 1/9th scale is fully painted. The sculpture comes with interchangeable hands, either holding a sword or the Staff of Solomon stick. It comes on a black display base and is numbered from a limited edition run of 550.

==Copyright and trademark==
Trademark on the name Solomon Kane and the names of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s other principal characters are claimed by Paradox Entertainment of Stockholm, Sweden, through its US subsidiary Paradox Entertainment Inc. Paradox also claims copyrights on the stories written by other authors under license from Solomon Kane Inc. Since Robert E. Howard published his Solomon Kane stories at a time when the date of publication was the marker, the owners had to use the copyright symbol, and they had to renew after a certain time to maintain copyright, the exact status of all of Howard&#x27;s Solomon Kane works are in question.

Project Gutenberg, for example, holds only some of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s stories while Project Gutenberg Australia has a more complete selection, implying that the stories are unambiguously free from copyright under Australian law, while the possibility of copyright renewal disbars many from Project Gutenberg&#x27;s inclusion criteria in the United States.

Subsequent stories written by other authors are subject to the copyright laws of the relevant time.

==Solomon Kane stories by other authors==

===&quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot;===
&quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot; is an anthology series edited by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, where characters from French and international speculative fiction exist in the same universe. &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen, Volume 3: Danse Macabre&quot; includes a story entitled &quot;The Heart of the Moon&quot; by Matthew Baugh which features Solomon Kane as one of a group of adventurers visiting Féval&#x27;s vampire metropolis, Selene. &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen, Volume 4: Lords of Terror&quot; includes a story entitled &quot;The Anti-Pope of Avignon&quot; by Micah Harris featuring Solomon Kane as the central protagonist supporting the Huguenot cause in Avignon.

===The Wold Newton Family===
In Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot;, Farmer identifies Solomon Kane as being a direct ancestor of adventurer Doc Savage. This book is part of a larger literary conceit that the (real) meteorite which fell in World Newton, Yorkshire, England, on December 13, 1795, was radioactive and caused genetic mutations in the occupants of a passing coach. As luck would have it many of these occupants were also already of heroic stock. See the Savage Family Tree.

===Observable Things===
Paul Di Filippo&#x27;s &quot;Observable Things&quot;, as narrated by a young Cotton Mather, tells of Solomon Kane coming to the aid of the colonists in New England during King Philip&#x27;s War.

<text>The 1999 Nunavut general election was the first general election in the territory and was held on February 15, 1999, to elect the members of the 1st Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.

Although Nunavut did not become a territory until April 1, 1999 the election was held early to enable the members to assume their duties on that date.

The territory operates on a consensus government system with no political parties; the premier is subsequently chosen by and from the MLAs.

Paul Okalik was chosen to be Premier of Nunavut.

<doc id="1004321" wikidata="Q8019501" url="?curid=1004321" title="William Travers (New Zealand politician)">
<text>William Thomas Locke Travers (January 1819 – 23 April 1903) was a New Zealand lawyer, politician, explorer, and naturalist.

==Early life==

Travers was born near Newcastle West, County Limerick, Ireland, either on 9 or 19 January 1819. His father chose to retire to France, and Travers was consequently brought up there. He was educated in Saint-Malo, a town in Brittany. In 1835, he joined the British military, and was part of the British Auxiliary Legion that fought in Spain&#x27;s First Carlist War. After his military service ended, Travers became a lawyer. In 1849, he and his family moved to Nelson, New Zealand, where he continued to practice law. Later, he also lived in Christchurch and Wellington. He purchased Englefield Lodge in Christchurch in 1866 and sold the property in 1872 to Edward Stevens.

==Political career==




Travers&#x27; political career covered both national and provincial politics. He was a member of the 1st New Zealand Parliament, representing first the Town of Nelson and then Waimea electorates, and served in the brief Forsaith Ministry formed by Thomas Forsaith.

In the 1st Parliament, the Town of Nelson was a two member electorate. On nomination day on 25 July 1853, Travers and James Mackay were the only candidates put forward. They were thus declared elected unopposed. Parliament&#x27;s first term started on 24 May 1854. Travers and William Cautley, MP for Waimea, both resigned on 26 May 1854. Travers subsequently contested the electorate that Cautley had vacated, being elected in the 21 June 1854 Waimea by-election. He was re-elected in the 1855 general election, but was disqualified on 26 July 1859.

Travers returned in the 4th Parliament as representative for the City of Christchurch, after winning the 1867 by-election. He resigned on 29 July 1870 before the end of the term. He was a member of the 6th Parliament as representative for the City of Wellington, having won the 1877 by-election. He resigned on 25 January 1878.

He also served in the councils of Nelson Province and Canterbury Province, and unsuccessfully stood for the superintendency of both. He stood as one of seven candidates for the Nelson Provincial Council in August 1853 in the Town of Nelson electorate, where five seats were elected. He came sixth and was thus not elected.

He represented Wellington in parliament from 1877 to 1881, but was not elected when he stood again in 1893. In Wellington he was City Solicitor, and was an advocate for the &quot;west coast railway&quot; in 1878. He subsequently became company solicitor to the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company which built the line north from Wellington to the Manawatu.

His most significant political contribution was his campaign to make central government (rather than provincial government) responsible for education.

==Author==
Travers was a frequent contributor to scientific journals and was also the author of &quot;Stirring Times of Te Rauparaha&quot;.

==Explorer, naturalist, photographer==
At the same time, Travers was also an avid explorer and naturalist, often mounting expeditions into the less well known parts of New Zealand. He was responsible for tracing the source of the Waiau River, and gave the Ada River its name. He also collected many samples of mountain grasses and flowers, sending them to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Travers was also responsible for drafting the legislation that created the Wellington Botanic Garden, and was a Botanic Garden board member for 22 years.

==Death and commemoration==
Travers died in an accident at the Lower Hutt railway station on 27 April 1903, when attempting to alight from a moving train. His funeral was held at Lower Hutt, and he was buried in the Bolton Street Cemetery, Wellington.

His first wife Jane died in 1888 aged 67 years old, and he remarried to Theodora Leslie Barclay in 1891; she remarried to Colonel Edward Wood in 1905.

So he left a widow (Theodora) from his second marriage, and a son Henry Travers) from his first marriage. His descendants settled in Marlborough.

The Travers River in the Travers Valley, as well as the nearby Mt Travers, the Travers Saddle in the Travers Range, Upper Travers Hut and the Travers-Sabine Circuit in Nelson Lakes National Park are named after him, as is the Travers Room at the Rainbow Ski Area.

At least one plant species, &quot;Olearia traversiorum&quot;, was named for him (and his son).

<doc id="1004324" wikidata="Q938029" url="?curid=1004324" title="Paul Hardcastle">
<text>Paul Louis Hardcastle (born 10 December 1957) is an English composer, musician, record producer, songwriter, radio presenter and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known for his song &quot;19&quot;, which went to number one on the UK Singles Chart in 1985.

==Early life==
Born in Kensington, London, England, on 10 December 1957, Hardcastle is the son of Joyce (&quot;née&quot; Everett, 1930–1991) and Louis Hardcastle (1915–2000).

==Career==
Hardcastle began his career in 1981 when he became the keyboard player for British soul band Direct Drive. In 1982, Hardcastle and lead vocalist Derek Green left the band to form a duo under the name First Light. They achieved some minor success in the UK chart, but the project was abandoned after two years and Hardcastle pursued a solo career.

Hardcastle achieved some success with his early singles, including the 1984 electro-funk/freestyle/instrumental track, &quot;Rain Forest&quot;, which along with the track &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;, reached number two on the dance chart. &quot;Rain Forest&quot; also hit number five on the soul chart and number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Rain Forest&quot;, the album both tracks were released on, was nominated for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist) in the 28th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Musician&quot; by Ernie Watts would win the award that year.

Hardcastle is best known for the 1985 single &quot;19&quot;, which went to No. 1 in the UK (for five weeks), as well as several other countries worldwide. It also reached number 15 in the U.S. Pop chart and number 1 in the U.S. Dance chart. The song received the Ivor Novello Award for Best-selling single of 1985. The follow-up single to &quot;19&quot; was &quot;Just for Money&quot;, which reached No. 19 in the UK. It also charted in several other European countries.

In 1986, Hardcastle released a remix to &quot;One Wish&quot; by Hiroshima. In the same year, Hardcastle&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard&quot; was adopted as the theme tune for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; weekly chart show. The theme tune was used from 3 April 1986 to 26 September 1991.

The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste My Time&quot; became Hardcastle&#x27;s second UK top ten in March 1986. It featured singer Carol Kenyon, a backing vocalist of Heaven 17. In late 1986, Hardcastle collaborated with the supergroup Disco Aid (later rebranded as Dance Aid in 1987) co-producing the charity single &quot;Give Give Give&quot;.

In 1989, Hardcastle resumed working on First Light, collaborating with vocalist Kevin Henry, whom he had worked with on previous recordings.

Using his alias Deff Boyz, Hardcastle released the single &quot;Swing&quot; in 1990. It reached number 84 on the UK chart, number 27 in Germany, and number 18 in the US Dance chart.

Since the 1990s, Hardcastle has recorded several synth jazz albums, alternating releases under the pseudonyms Kiss the Sky (with Jaki Graham) and the Jazzmasters, as well as under his real name.

==Personal life==
Hardcastle married Dolores Baker in 1985, and they have three children including British DJ and singer Maxine as well as musician Paul Hardcastle Jr. who both contributed vocals to Hardcastle&#x27;s &quot;Transcontinental&quot;, a 2011 collection of new music recorded with Ryan Farish.

<text>Horst P. Horst (born Horst Paul Albert Bormann; August 14, 1906 
– November 18, 1999) was a German-American fashion photographer.

==Early life==
The younger of the sons, Horst was born in Weissenfels-an-der-Saale, Germany, to Klara (Schönbrodt) and Max Bohrmann. His father was a successful merchant. In his teens, he met dancer Evan Weidemann at the home of his aunt, and this aroused his interest in avant-garde art. In the late 1920s, Horst studied at Hamburg Kunstgewerbeschule, leaving there in 1930 to go to Paris to study under the architect Le Corbusier.

==Youth==
While in Paris, he befriended many people in the art community and visited many galleries. In 1930 he met &quot;Vogue&quot; photographer Baron George Hoyningen-Huene, a half-Baltic, half-American nobleman, and became his photographic assistant, occasional model, and lover. He traveled to England with him that winter. While there, they visited photographer Cecil Beaton, who was working for the British edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 1931, Horst began his association with &quot;Vogue&quot;, publishing his first photograph in French &quot;Vogue&quot; in December of that year. It was a full-page advertisement showing a model in black velvet holding a Klytia scent bottle.

His first exhibition took place at La Plume d&#x27;Or in Paris in 1932. It was reviewed by Janet Flanner in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and this review, which appeared after the exhibition ended, made Horst instantly prominent. Horst made a portrait of Bette Davis the same year, the first in a series of public figures he would photograph during his career. Within two years, he had photographed Noël Coward, Yvonne Printemps, Lisa Fonssagrives, Count Luchino Visconti di Madrone, Duke Fulco di Verdura, Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg, Princess Natalia Pavlovna Paley, Daisy Fellowes, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, Cole Porter, Elsa Schiaparelli, Eve Curie, and others.

Horst rented an apartment in New York City in 1937, and while residing there met Coco Chanel, whom Horst called &quot;the queen of the whole thing&quot;. He would photograph her fashions for three decades.

He met Valentine Lawford, British diplomat in 1938, and they lived together until Lawford&#x27;s death in 1991. Horst adopted a son, Richard J. Horst, whom they raised together.

In 1941, Horst applied for United States citizenship. In 1942, he passed an Army physical, and joined the Army on July 2, 1943. On October 21, he received his United States citizenship as Horst P. Horst. He became an Army photographer, with much of his work printed in the forces&#x27; magazine &quot;Belvoir Castle&quot;. In 1945, he photographed United States President Harry S. Truman, with whom he became friends, and he photographed every First Lady in the post-war period at the invitation of the White House. In 1947, Horst moved into his house in Oyster Bay, New York. He designed the white stucco-clad building himself, the design inspired by the houses that he had seen in Tunisia during his relationship with Hoyningen-Huene.

==Work==
Horst is best known for his photographs of women and fashion, but is also recognized for his photographs of interior architecture, still lifes, especially ones including plants, and environmental portraits. One of the great iconic photos of the 20th century is &quot;The Mainbocher Corset&quot; with its erotically charged mystery, captured by Horst in &quot;Vogue&quot;’s Paris studio in 1939. Designers like Donna Karan continue to use the timeless beauty of &quot;The Mainbocher Corset&quot; as an inspiration for their outerwear collections today. His work frequently reflects his interest in surrealism and his regard of the ancient Greek ideal of physical beauty.

His method of work typically entailed careful preparation for the shoot, with the lighting and studio props (of which he used many) arranged in advance. His instructions to models are remembered as being brief and to the point. His published work uses lighting to pick out the subject; he frequently used four spotlights, often one of them pointing down from the ceiling. Only rarely do his photos include shadows falling on the background of the set. Horst rarely, if ever, used filters. While most of his work is in black and white, much of his color photography includes largely monochromatic settings to set off a colorful fashion. Horst&#x27;s color photography did include documentation of society interior design, well noted in the volume &quot;Horst Interiors&quot;. He photographed a number of interiors designed by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade of Denning &amp; Fourcade and often visited their homes in Manhattan and Long Island. After taking the photograph, Horst generally left it up to others to develop, print, crop, and edit his work.

One of his most famous portraits is of Marlene Dietrich, taken in 1942. She protested the lighting that he had selected and arranged, but he used it anyway. Dietrich liked the results and subsequently used a photo from the session in her own publicity.

==Later life==
In the 1960s, encouraged by &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Diana Vreeland, Horst began a series of photos illustrating the lifestyle of international high society which included Consuelo Vanderbilt, Marella Agnelli, Gloria Guinness, Baroness Pauline de Rothschild and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, Helen of Greece and Denmark, Baroness Geoffroy de Waldner, Princess Tatiana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, Lee Radziwill, Duke of Windsor and Duchess of Windsor, Peregrine Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans and Lady Jacquetta Eliot, Countess of St Germans, Antenor Patiño, Annette Reed, Oscar de la Renta and Françoise de Langlade, Desmond Guinness and Princess Henriette Marie-Gabrielle von Urach, Andy Warhol, Nancy Lancaster, Yves Saint Laurent, Doris Duke, Emilio Pucci, Cy Twombly, Billy Baldwin, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Amanda Burden, Paloma Picasso and Comtesse Jacqueline de Ribes. The articles were written by the photographer&#x27;s longtime companion, Valentine Lawford, a former English diplomat. From this point until nearly the time of his death, Horst spent most of his time traveling and taking photographs. In the mid-1970s, he began working for &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine as well as for &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Horst&#x27;s last photograph for British &quot;Vogue&quot; was in 1991 with Princess Michael of Kent, shown against a background of tapestry and wearing a tiara belonging to her mother-in-law, Princess Marina, whom he had photographed in 1934. He died at his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida at 93 years of age.

<doc id="1004327" wikidata="Q806725" url="?curid=1004327" title="Bankcard">
<text>Bankcard was a shared brand credit card issued by financial institutions in Australia and New Zealand between 1974 and 2006. It was managed by the &quot;Bankcard Association of Australia&quot;, a joint venture of Australia&#x27;s largest banks, and was the nation&#x27;s first mass market credit card.

Before 1974, only store cards, Diners Club and American Express were available in Australia and these were either restrictive or only accessible to the wealthy.

In the first decade after its introduction, Bankcard dominated the Australian credit card market, with more than five million cardholders at its peak in 1984. As a result of a declining cardholder base, falling transaction volumes and shrinking market share in relation to internationally accepted credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard, the card was withdrawn from use in 2006.

==History==
Before Bankcard, the relatively small population of Australia, coupled with its vast geographical spread made a credit card system cost prohibitive for any single Australian bank. In the beginning of the 1970s, a number of banks combined to seek approval from the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Federal Treasury to commence a credit card scheme in the Australian financial market.

Approval was granted in 1972. The banks formed a company, &quot;Charge Card Services Limited&quot;, to manage Bankcard and process credit card transactions. Each member bank issued its own variant of the Bankcard card and each established its own credit rules and maintained direct customer relations with its own cardholders. Bankcard was officially launched in October 1974 by then Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam.

A significant marketing campaign followed the card&#x27;s launch. This included what was then the biggest direct mail marketing campaign in Australia to date. Among other things, banks posted a card with a A$300 credit limit to potential clients, following analysis of their accounts. In December 1974, David Jones became the first major retailing organisation to accept Bankcard and by 1976, the card was accepted by almost every Australian department chain.

Within 18 months of the card&#x27;s issue, there were more than one million cardholders, representing more than 6% of the Australian population. 1983 saw the expansion of Bankcard to New Zealand. By 1984, there were more than five million cardholders in Australia and New Zealand. In April 1986, there was a dispute between the banks as to whether Bankcard would be included in the then new electronic banking EFTPOS system.

At the time, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac were heavily promoting Mastercard and providing only minimal support to the Bankcards they issued, while the ANZ Bank, National Australia Bank and state banks all supported Bankcard. The banks came to an accord whereby magnetic strips would be placed on all Bankcards, allowing them to be used in the EFTPOS system.

==Withdrawal==
By the beginning of 2006, the number of cardholders had declined to around one million. Popularity of the card had declined as other credit card options became available. Bankcard was significantly limited by its lack of acceptance outside Australia and New Zealand. Despite this, Bankcard continued to generate profits for member banks, largely because the elderly demographic of cardholders had a low incidence of default.

In February 2006, however, the Bankcard Association of Australia announced that it would phase out Bankcard by the end of that year, citing the exceptional growth of credit card operations and improvements in technology allowing member banks to perform their own data capture and processing in house. Existing cardholders were offered alternative credit cards by their issuing banks.

At the time of this announcement, the National Australia Bank remained the only bank still issuing Bankcard. Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank had stopped issuing the card in June and December 2005 respectively. Merchants within Australia were able to accept Bankcards until the end of 2006. Bankcard operations were closed in New Zealand in October 2005.

==Cultural impact==
Bankcard was the first widely available credit card issued by Australian banks for general consumption. Banks actively sought to educate consumers on how to use credit cards and it &quot;revolutionised&quot; the way Australian consumers paid for goods and services. According to Gregory Melleuish, the introduction of Bankcard helped accelerate the process of establishing consumerism in Australia.

On the withdrawal of Bankcard in February 2006, retailer Gerry Harvey stated that the credit card had &quot;inspired, or enabled, more people to buy on credit and all retailers&#x27; sales improved.&quot; Supriya Singh, a professor at RMIT, argued that the introduction of Bankcard marked the beginning of Australia&#x27;s transformation to virtual money. The availability of credit cards in Australia after 1974, together with wider financial deregulation, resulted in significant increases in household indebtedness.

As late as 2025, Bankcard could still be seen on stickers on shop fronts in New Zealand.

<doc id="1004335" wikidata="Q2606925" url="?curid=1004335" title="Shinken">
<text>is a Japanese sword that has a forged and sharpened blade. The term &quot;shinken&quot; is often used in contrast with &quot;bokken&quot; (wooden sword), &quot;shinai&quot; (bamboo sword), and iaitō (unsharpened metal sword).

Shinken are often used in battōdō, iaidō, and iaijutsu (forms of combative sword-drawing), as well as tameshigiri (test-cutting through targets). In these arts, shinken may be used alongside unsharpened iaitō (居合刀) or mogitō (模擬刀), training swords manufactured for swordsmanship practice. &quot;Gendaitō&quot; (現代刀; modern-made swords) are handmade shinken by one of approximately 250 swordsmiths active in Japan at the moment, members of the Japanese Swordsmith Association. These swordsmiths are limited by Japanese law to producing no more than twenty-four swords a year each. This limit, along with highly specialized skills and the need for a great deal of manual labour, accounts for the high price that a Japanese-made shinken (Nihontō) can fetch—starting from about US$6,000 for the blade alone, and going many times higher for genuine antique (Mukansa or Ningen Kokuho are two famous types) blades.

There is also a large worldwide market for &quot;shinken&quot; made outside Japan. Many collectors consider these to be somewhat worthless as collectibles (since they are not Nihontō), but some martial artists continue to purchase and use them, because of their considerably lower price, ease of acquisition, and also to spare their valuable Nihontō from what some view as abuse. The vast majority of these are made in China, but there are custom smiths all over the world manufacturing swords in the Japanese style.

<text>This is a list of territorial elections in Northwest Territories, Canada since 1870. The Northwest Territories operates on a consensus government using the First Past the Post electoral system. The territory does not presently recognize political parties.

The last election was held on November 14, 2023.

==Voting and consensus government==

Northwest Territories elects members to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories under a non-partisan system known as consensus government. The election only decides who represents each district. The newly elected members of the assembly convene after the election to vote amongst themselves to decide which members become part of the Executive Council. This system of government has evolved in the Northwest Territories since 1870.

The voting method to elect members is the first-past-the-post electoral system. Voters under this system pick the top candidate by the number of votes cast regardless of the percent of votes earned by a candidate. With a few historical exceptions all electoral districts in the Northwest Territories are represented by a single member. First Past the Post has been used since the first election in 1881. Elections NWT is the independent regulatory body in charge of overseeing elections.

==History of elections==
The Northwest Territories has been through a number of distinct changes in how the territory is governed and how government has been selected. These changes have coincided with several major boundary changes since the Government of Canada acquired the territory in 1870. From 1870 to 1876 the North-West Territories was run by an interim government, first led by lieutenant-governor William McDougall, and a council appointed by Ottawa. This council was governed under the &quot;Temporary Government of Rupert&#x27;s Land Act, 1869&quot; and the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; The council itself sat in Manitoba and was made up of Members of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly.

In 1876 the Temporary Council was dissolved and a new council was appointed under the &quot;North-West Territories Act&quot;. Members could be elected to join the council if an area of had 1,000 inhabitants. The first such electoral districts were created in 1881. According to the Act, when the council reached twenty members, it would gain control of territorial affairs from the crown. The Council achieved this requirement in 1886. The council was renamed to an assembly and was dissolved in 1888. Twelve elections to rotate and elect members to new districts were held during the period between 1876 and 1888.

Five general elections would occur between 1888 and 1905, as the territories underwent significant growth. In 1897 after an amendment to the North-West Territories Act, the territories experienced a short-lived period of partisan politics that led to the North-West Territories Liberal-Conservative Party being elected in the fourth and fifth elections until 1905. The government in this period was made of members from the populated regions in the south. No members from the Arctic region would sit in government until 1947. In 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan were carved out of the North-West Territories. As a result, the population dropped from approx 160,000 to 17,000, of which 16,000 were aboriginal and had no right to vote under Canadian law. The government of the North-West Territories defaulted back to its 1870 constitutional status, and once again came under federal control. This period of the second council, which governed from Ottawa, lasted from 1905 to 1951.

In 1951, the second council was dissolved in order to return to elections. Rather than being fully elected body, the Councils and Assemblies were a mix of elected and appointed members. After 1975 the Assembly became fully elected. In 1999 the Northwest Territories underwent one last division as the territory of Nunavut was created out of the eastern half of the territory.

The boundary changes have resulted in a disconnect in four periods of the territorial government. The records of the temporary council falls under the archives of the Manitoba government, while the archives and electoral records of the period of government from 1876 to 1905 were retained by the Saskatchewan government. The archives of the council from 1905 to 1951 are under the Canadian Government who appointed the council from that period.

<text>&quot;El Paso Diablos&quot; refers to two different professional baseball teams based in El Paso, Texas, in the United States. The most recent Diablos were a member of the South Division of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. From 1990 to 2013, the Diablos, in both incarnations, played their home games at Cohen Stadium. The team&#x27;s name means &quot;devils&quot; in the Spanish language.

==Team history==

=== A Maverick Beginning ===

The team has its roots going back to 1892, when the team was originally called the El Paso Browns. The name eventually changed to the Mavericks. In 1913, the El Paso Mavericks played in the Copper League, which consisted of teams from Silver City, Hurley, and Santa Rita, New Mexico. Despite coming in third place that season, the Mavericks went on to win the post season tournament, becoming the Southwestern Champions of 1913. In 1915, the Mavericks joined the Rio Grande Association, a Class D minor league. Though the league folded after a year, the Mavericks continued to play in some form or another.

In 1924, the longtime home for the team, Dudley Field (known, locally as the &quot;Dudley Dome&quot;) named for El Paso Mayor R.M. &quot;Dick&quot; Dudley, was constructed in South El Paso. While technically not a Dome in any sense of the word, the stadium had a supernatural ability to avoid rain showers and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium. Another unique feature of the park was that the structure under the main grandstand was constructed out of adobe. A final feature, one that would be used by the Brewers to test their pitchers in the future was that it was notoriously hitter friendly. Due to its cozy dimensions (340-395-340), pitchers had to work hard to make sure their ERAs would at least be below five.

In 1922, Syd and Andy Cohen played for the Mavericks and later played in the Major Leagues. Andy Cohen was a second baseman for the New York Giants, and Syd was a pitcher for several different teams in the American League, though he would be the last pitcher to strike out Babe Ruth. Syd also pitched in the Mexican leagues and later managed the Juarez team.

===From Mavericks to Texans===

In 1930, the team, now known as the El Paso Texans, was admitted to the Arizona State League in 1930 to replace the defunct Mesa Jewels. The Arizona State League included teams from Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas. El Paso was the only Texas team in the league and missed winning the pennant by only half a game, losing to the Bisbee Bees.

The Texans remained in this league for decades. In 1931, the Arizona State League became the Arizona–Texas League, which ran from 1931–32 and revived in 1937–1941. In 1940, the League was made into a Class C league. The league halted play from 1942 to 1946 because of World War II, though the Texans did play in the Mexican National League for one year, in 1946. The Arizona–Texas League play resumed in 1947, until 1950, when the league merged with the Sunset League to form the Southwest International League. This league only lasted for a year before reverting into the Arizona–Texas League.

In 1950, owner Jack Corbett sold the team in August to Dick Saunders and Tom Love, two young El Paso building contractors. Saunders and Love hired John Phelan to be the general manager. The Texans finished in second only to their rivals, the Juarez Indios, at the end of the season.

In 1951, the New York Yankees (featuring a young rookie named Mickey Mantle) came to El Paso to play an exhibition game against the Texans, winning 16–10. In 1954, the team was sold to Dick Azar, the El Paso Coors distributor who brought beer to the ballpark for the first time. Beer was sold during the game and was given to the players in their dressing room free of charge after the games.

After losing money for two seasons, Azar sold the team to Pat McLaughlin in 1956. The team won the Southwestern League pennant that season, but only 51,386 fans came to see the Texans play all season. Due to money problems, McLaughlin handed the team in 1957 to Tom McHugh, S.E. Adams and Jimmy Hamilton. At the end of the season, the Southwestern League dropped the El Paso Texans.

===The dawn of the Sun Kings===

Professional baseball was not played in El Paso again until 1961 when a group of 40 people, known as the Sports Development Committee of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce, took it upon themselves to revive it. John Phelan, the Texans former manager, was named vice president and general manager. Each of the 40 people put up to $500 to help finance the team. Phelan and the committee managed to get the organization into the Class D Sophomore League and renamed the team the El Paso Sun Kings. The Sun Kings had a terrific season, finishing in third, and, for the first time, turned a profit.

In 1962, the Sun Kings joined the Class AA Texas League. The organization&#x27;s rookie season was a huge success, as they won the Texas League championship. In 1963, the team hit 207 home runs, setting a new league record for most home runs in a season.

From 1961 to 1964, the El Paso Ball club had been affiliated with the San Francisco Giants, their most notable player coming through the system at the time being Jesús Alou of the famous baseball family. In 1965, the Sun Kings became a farm team for the California Angels.
The Sports Development Committee sold the team to Angels owner Gene Autry for $1, fulfilling their mission of bringing professional baseball back to El Paso. John Stanfill replaced John Phelan as general manager in 1967, and the team came in second to Albuquerque, which won the Texas League pennant that season. In the sixties several future major leaguers got their start in El Paso including José Cardenal and Randy Hundley. The most publicized of the young players was Dick Dietz who it was told got a $500,000 signing bonus. During the Sun Kings&#x27; tenure as an Angel Affiliate, one of their most famous prospects passed through their system: a young second base prospect by the name of Kurt Russell. Russell led the league in hitting with a .563 batting average. However, during a play, he was hit in the shoulder by another player running to second base, the collision resulting in a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder. The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973, and he returned to acting. Russell recently told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that before his injury, he was going to be called up. During this era players collected dollar bills from the chicken wire fence between the stands and the field for outstanding play.

The partnership with the Angels lasted until 1970. The city was without a team for one year until 1972 when the Los Angeles Dodgers brought in their AA affiliate and the team&#x27;s name was changed to Sun Dodgers for the season. The partnership with the Angels resumed and the name reverted to Sun Kings in 1973.

===Diablos and other Minor League revolutionaries===
In 1974, Jim Paul bought the team for $1000 and assumed the team&#x27;s $52,000 in outstanding debt, and proceeded to revolutionize baseball, not only in El Paso but throughout the Minor Leagues and even influence the Majors. Paul&#x27;s purchase of the team ushered in the golden age of El Paso baseball. The name of the team was changed to the Diablos, the Spanish word for &quot;devils&quot;. Paul held numerous innovative promotions and promoted a lively, fan-friendly atmosphere at the ballpark. Sparing any expense, save a coat of bright yellow paint with the word &quot;BASEBALL&quot; written in twelve foot tall red letters, Dudley Field was converted to &quot;The Dudley Dome.&quot; While technically not a dome in any sense of the word, the field had a supernatural ability to avoid rain-outs and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium. The home team dugout had the word &quot;diablos&quot; painted on top while the visitors dugout received a coat of paint that said &quot;enemy.&quot; Upon entering the turnstiles fans were given a facial tissue to use for &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby&quot; when the visiting team changed pitchers the outgoing pitcher was serenaded by the Janis Joplin tune over the PA system while the fans in the grandstand waved their tissues. One notable victim was Dennis Eckersley who acknowledged the crowd by tipping his hat, though others were not so considerate and the Texas League created a standard fine for those obscene gestures. Other promotions included 10¢ hotdog night, nickel beer night, and Martinez Appreciation Night where anyone with the last name Martinez received free admission.

Paul&#x27;s innovative marketing techniques showed outstanding results. In 1975 despite finishing 18 ½ games out of first place the Diablos drew 162,395 fans, more than every other Class AA team and 16 of the 24 Triple-A teams. Paul was named Sporting News&#x27; Class Double A Executive of the Year in 1974 and 1975. in 1976 the Diablos came in third and attendance increased to 181,747, outdrawing all but 6 teams in the minor leagues, and were awarded the MacPhail Trophy, which is given to the outstanding organization in all minor league baseball. In 1977 the Diablos finished in first place and drew 217,345 fans which outpaced all but 4 Triple-A teams and Paul was once again recognized as Sporting News&#x27; Class Double A Executive of the Year for a third time.

In 1978 the Diablos completed a 9-game winning streak to back-door the Texas League Western Division Championship and then swept the Jackson Mets in a best of 5 series to claim the Texas League banner. During that 12-game winning streak, the San Diego Chicken made his debut outside the San Diego area and his minor league debut by performing in the final regular game of the season before a more than sold out stadium. It was the catalyst to launch his career during his hiatus from San Diego due to court injunctions that prevented him from performing for the Padres.

In 1980, the Diablos began airing all of their baseball games on radio station KHEY (AM) AM-690 and simulcast select homegames on Paragon Cable, with current UTEP football announcer Jon Teicher as its first play-by-play announcer. Other notable Diablos announcers include current play-by-play announcer for the Oakland A&#x27;s Vince Cotroneo (1985–1987), and Matt Vasgersian (1993–1995) who currently provides play-by-play for Fox Sports&#x27; Major League Baseball coverage and is a studio host for MLB Network.

In 1981, the Diablos became an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers, a relationship which lasted until 1999. Tony Muser was the manager for the first two seasons.

Also in 1981, Texaco sponsored the installation of a $70,000 electronic scoreboard at Dudley Field, previously the scoreboard had been hand operated. The Diablos won the Texas League Pennant in 1986. In 1988, the Diablos also had a young prospect named Gary Sheffield.

However, as the decade continued, the old Dudley Dome was showing its age. It became apparent that the team would need a new facility, as the city was expanding and the Dudley Dome was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Construction began in the growing Northeast area of El Paso on a new facility. With the stadium not completed in time for the start of the 1990 season the Diablos continued to play at Dudley Dome. On June 13, 1990 the Diablos said farewell to the Dudley Dome, their home of 65 years, and greeted their new ballpark, Cohen Stadium, named after the Cohen brothers Syd Cohen and Andy Cohen, who had returned to El Paso to work for the club. The Dudley Dome continued to have tenants however, hosting the El Paso Patriots Soccer Club, and the final tenant the El Paso Scorpions Rugby Club. Dudley Field was finally demolished on November 5, 2005 to make room for the new African wing of the El Paso Zoo.

In 1990, Cohen Stadium opened to the public, becoming an immediate success for the team. That same year, it became the only minor league ballpark to grace the cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. In 1993 The Diablos became the first Double A team to ever draw 300,000 fans. The Diablos won the Texas League pennant again in 1994 and remained competitive for several years after.
In 1999, the Diablos ended their relationship with Brewers, and soon agreed to become the Double A affiliate for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Paul had sold the team to Diamond Sports in 1996, who in turn sold the team in 2004 to Brett Sports and Entertainment, a sports conglomerate headed by former major leaguer George Brett.

===The death of the El Paso Diablos?===

This change instead signalled the beginning of the end of Minor League baseball in El Paso. The Diablos ceased many of the promotions that made the team successful earlier, and the lack of strong players (save for the brief time that Brad Penny spent in the organization) in the Arizona system rendered the team weak and unsuccessful. With the exception of making the playoffs in 2000, the team was largely dismal and the atmosphere around the park had largely changed from the lighthearted atmosphere that had existed during the Jim Paul era.

One other factor that affected attendance was the constant rumors that the team would be moved, rumors that Brett Sports and Entertainment would refuse to admit or deny. With every stadium construction that seemed to take place around the country, the Diablos would always be linked as a possible tenant. Furthermore, Brett Sports and Entertainment demanded the city of El Paso make millions in renovations to Cohen Stadium, which the city refused when there was no indication that the team would be staying. There was a brief spike in attendance on July 11, 2003 when Randy Johnson made a rehab start, but attendance remained low and the team began to hemorrhage money.

In 2004, with the Diablos’ contract with the Diamondbacks soon to expire, ownership made no move to re-sign with the Diamondbacks. While there was speculation of the team possibly changing teams, Diablo fans&#x27; worst fears were realized when it was announced that the team had been sold to the St. Louis Cardinals for an estimated $9.8 million. Public backlash resulted; Brett Sports and Entertainment attempted to search for a team to replace the departing Diablos, but in the end, the Diablos moved to Springfield, Missouri to become the Springfield Cardinals (for more information on the original team&#x27;s history at this point, see the corresponding article).

===The rebirth of the El Paso Diablos===
However, the move of the team signalled a new beginning of the Diablos. In 2005, it was announced that the independent Central Baseball League had granted a franchise to Mark Schuster, who brought back the Diablos to begin play that same year. Former Los Angeles Dodgers first-baseman/right fielder Mike Marshall was selected to manage the team. The front office returned to the management style that had been in use during the Jim Paul era, bringing back many fans that had become disenchanted with the team in recent years.

The team&#x27;s debut on May 6, 2005, set a league attendance record of 10,116. Though the team finished in last during the first half of the season, the Diablos came alive in the second half, finishing in third and just missing the playoffs. The team set an attendance record for the league, finishing with an attendance of 190,429. The team also had several other special moments throughout the year. On Friday, July 8, 2005, former major leaguer and El Paso native Rocky Coppinger took the mound for a start. On July 27, the Florida Marlins purchased the contract of RHP Andy Torres from the Diablos.

Following the end of the season, the Diablos announced that they would join with several fellow Central League members including the Coastal Bend Aviators, the Fort Worth Cats, the Pensacola Pelicans, and the Shreveport Sports and join with former Northern League teams the Saint Paul Saints, Sioux City Explorers, the Sioux Falls Pheasants, and the Lincoln Saltdogs to form the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball as an independent minor league. The league began play in 2006 with a 96-game schedule along with an expansion team in St. Joseph, Missouri known as the Blacksnakes. The league&#x27;s first All-Star game was in El Paso, Texas and played against the Can-Am League in July 2006.

With the second season beginning in May 2006, the Diablos had an air of hope around them and were expected to contend in their new league. However, the team had vastly changed from the year before thanks to the purchase of closer Derrick DePriest by the Kansas City Royals on February 13, 2006. Also, upon Marshalls request, several members of the San Angelo Colts were signed, giving the Diablos possibly the most powerful offensive unit in the league, but the pitching staff that had been so mediocre the year before was unchanged. The team stumbled badly at the start of the season. The offense was dormant through much of the time, a factor that was worsened when offensive star Juan Camacho was bought by the Chicago White Sox on May 29. With the team floundering, on June 16, 2006, Marshall was released and replaced in the coming days by former major league pitcher Butch Henry, a graduate of El Paso&#x27;s Eastwood High School. Though Henry provided some improvement, the team was still terrible and continued to struggle. The Diablos would lose shortstop Albenis Machado on August 13 when he was sold to the Chicago Cubs and eight days later would be on the receiving end of a no-hitter by Fort Worth Cats pitcher Joel Kirsten. The Diablos would ultimately finish last in the Southern Division.

With new manager Butch Henry on board the Diablos were expected to be a much better team for the 2007 season, and they did finish the first half of the season in first place in the Southern Division with 28 wins and 23 losses and 4 games ahead of second place Shreveport and automatically getting a spot for the league play-offs – their first play-off appearance since the 2000 season when they were in the AA Texas League. Another exciting thing happened in the first half of the season on the 4th of July, the Diablos set the league attendance single-game record with more than 11,000 fans attending a game.

===The end, again===
After a disappointing 2011 baseball season, Schuster sold the Diablos to the Tigua Tribe, a Native American tribe in June 2011.

The Diablos were replaced by the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League for the 2014 baseball season. This coincided with the opening of a new baseball stadium in downtown El Paso, which replaced Cohen Stadium as the home of professional baseball in El Paso.

The Diablos relocated to Joe Becker Stadium in Joplin, Missouri, as the Joplin Blasters beginning with the 2015 season.

<doc id="1004355" wikidata="Q313386" url="?curid=1004355" title="Gilbert Ryle">
<text>Gilbert Ryle (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher, principally known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, for which he coined the phrase &quot;ghost in the machine.&quot; Some of Ryle&#x27;s ideas in philosophy of mind have been called behaviourist. In his best-known book, &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949), he writes that the &quot;general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as &#x27;behaviourist&#x27;.&quot; Having studied the philosophers Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, Ryle suggested that the book instead &quot;could be described as a sustained essay in phenomenology, if you are at home with that label.&quot;

==Biography==

=== Family ===
Gilbert Ryle&#x27;s father, Reginald John Ryle, was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and astronomy, passing on to his children a large library. Gilbert&#x27;s father was a son of John Charles Ryle, the first Anglican Bishop of Liverpool. The Ryles were Cheshire landed gentry; Gilbert&#x27;s elder brother, John Alfred Ryle, of Barkhale, Sussex, became head of the family.

Gilbert Ryle&#x27;s mother, Catherine, was daughter of Samuel King Scott (younger brother of the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott) by his wife Georgina, daughter of William Hulme Bodley, M.D., and sister of architect George Frederick Bodley, himself a student of Sir George. Cousins of the Ryle family thus include the haematologist Ronald Bodley Scott, architect George Gilbert Scott Jr., founder of Watts &amp; Co., and his son, Giles Gilbert Scott, designer of the Battersea Power Station.

=== Early life and education ===
Gilbert Ryle was born in Brighton, England, on 19 August 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning.

He was educated at Brighton College and in 1919 went up to The Queen&#x27;s College at Oxford to study classics, but was soon drawn to philosophy. He graduated with a &quot;triple first&quot;; he received first-class honours in classical Honour Moderations (1921), &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (1923), and philosophy, politics, and economics (1924).

=== Career ===
In 1924, Ryle was appointed lecturer in philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford. A year later, he became a fellow and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.

In the Second World War, Ryle was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into intelligence work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He published &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; in 1949. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal &quot;Mind&quot; from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby, North Yorkshire.

Ryle&#x27;s brothers John Alfred (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at Brighton College, also had eminent careers. John became Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the Forestry Commission and appointed a CBE.

Ryle was the subject of a portrait by Rex Whistler, which he said made him look like &quot;a drowned German General&quot;. He was a lifelong bachelor, and in retirement he lived with his twin sister Mary.

==Work==
===&quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;===
In &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;, Ryle argues that dualism involves category mistakes and philosophical nonsense, two philosophical topics that continued to inform Ryle&#x27;s work. He rhetorically asked students in his 1967–68 Oxford audience what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bunghole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.

====Knowing-how and knowing-that====

A distinction deployed in &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;, between &#x27;knowing-how&#x27; and &#x27;knowing-that&#x27;, has attracted independent interest. This distinction is also the origin of procedural (&quot;knowing-how&quot;) and declarative (&quot;knowing-that&quot;) models of long-term memory. This distinction is widely accepted in philosophy.

An example of the distinction can be knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901.

===Philosophy as cartography===

Ryle thought it no longer possible to believe that a philosopher&#x27;s task is to study mental as opposed to physical objects. In its place, Ryle saw a tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that &quot;philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities.&quot;

Ryle analogizes philosophy to cartography. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker: the ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and geography. But when asked to interpret a map of that knowledge, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographic terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographic terms.

By &quot;mapping&quot; the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls implication threads: each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a &quot;concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs.&quot; To show this, he must be &quot;tugging&quot; at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be &quot;tugging.&quot; Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.

=== Thick description ===

In 1968 Ryle first introduced the notion of &quot;thick description&quot; in &quot;The Thinking of Thoughts: What is &#x27;Le Penseur&#x27; Doing?&quot; and &quot;Thinking and Reflecting&quot;. According to Ryle, there are two types of descriptions:

# thin description: surface-level observations of behaviour, e.g. &#x27;His right hand rose to his forehead, palm out, when he was in the vicinity of and facing a certain other human.&#x27;
# thick description: adds context to such behaviour. Explaining this context necessitates an understanding of the motivations people have for their behaviours, as well as how observers in the community understand such behaviour: &#x27;He saluted the General.&#x27;

==Legacy==
Ryle&#x27;s notion of thick description has been an important influence on cultural anthropologists such as Clifford Geertz.

&quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the ordinary language philosophy movement. But in the 1960s and 1970s, the rising influence of the cognitivist theories of Noam Chomsky, Herbert A. Simon, Jerry Fodor, and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. The two major postwar schools in the philosophy of mind, Fodor&#x27;s representationalism and Wilfrid Sellars&#x27;s functionalism, posited precisely the &#x27;internal&#x27; cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, a student of Ryle&#x27;s, has said that recent trends in psychology such as embodied cognition, discursive psychology, situated cognition, and others in the post-cognitivist tradition, have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle&#x27;s work. Dennett provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;.

Author Richard Webster endorsed Ryle&#x27;s arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting in &quot;Why Freud Was Wrong&quot; (1995) that they implied that &quot;theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature.&quot;

<doc id="1004359" wikidata="Q333232" url="?curid=1004359" title="Vasily Tatishchev">
<text>Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev (sometimes spelt Tatischev; , ; 19 April 1686 – 15 July 1750) was a statesman, historian, philosopher, and ethnographer in the Russian Empire. He is known as the author of a book on Russian history titled &quot;The History of Russia&quot; (), posthumously published in 1767. He also founded three cities in the Russian Empire: Stavropol-on-Volga (now known as Tolyatti), Yekaterinburg, and Perm.

Tatishchev often did not cite his sources, which required later critical historians to find out where he got his information from. After several sources were discovered, the texts of Tatishchev which remained unaccounted for (such as the alleged &quot;Ioachim Chronicle&quot;, which has never been found) became known as &quot;Tatishchev information&quot; (), which is not to be trusted until it is supported by another extant source.

==Life==
Tatishchev was born near Pskov on 19 April 1686. The young Tatishchev was homeschooled, being taught German and Polish. As an adult, he also studied some French and Latin, though he never mastered these two language very well. Having graduated from the Artillery and Engineering school in Moscow, he took part in the 1700–1721 Great Northern War with Sweden. In the service of Peter the Great he gained a prominent post in the Foreign Office, which he used to oppose the policies of the Supreme Privy Council and support Anna&#x27;s ascension to the Russian throne in 1730.

He was entrusted by Anna with a lucrative office of the management of Ural factories. At that post he founded the cities of Perm and Yekaterinburg, which have since grown into the veritable capitals of the Urals. A monument to him was opened in Perm in 2003. During the Bashkir War of 1735-40 he was in command of Siberian operations from the winter of 1736-37 and head of the whole operation from the spring of 1737. He was removed from command after March 1739, nominally on charges of corruption, but mainly because he had made too many enemies. Tatishchev finished his official career as a governor of Astrakhan (1741–44). He died at the Boldino estate near Moscow on 15 July 1750.

==Work==

Having retired from active service, the elderly statesman dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits. Feeling that the Russian historiography had been neglected, he discovered and published several legal monuments of great interest, e.g., Russkaya Pravda and Sudebnik of 1550. His magnum opus was the first sketch of Russian history, entitled &quot;Russian History Dating Back to the Most Ancient Times&quot; and published in 5 volumes after his death. He also compiled the first encyclopedic dictionary of the Russian language.

The scientific merits of Tatishchev&#x27;s work were disputed even in the 18th century. German historian August Ludwig von Schlözer (1735–1809) wrote that &#x27;[Tatishchev had] no training, did not know a single word of Latin, and did not even understand any modern language other than German&#x27;. However, American historian Edward C. Thaden (1986) said this criticism was somewhat exaggerated, given his knowledge of German and Polish, but poor understanding of French and Latin; nevertheless, his military and administrative training and experience did bring him some expertise in those fields. 

Russian historian Nikolay Karamzin (1766–1826) called all unsourced or poorly sourced claims by Tatishchev &quot;inventions&quot; and &quot;fantasies&quot;. It is true that he used some chronicles that have since been lost, but most of them, most notoriously the &quot;Ioachim Chronicle&quot;, were of dubious authenticity, and may never have existed in the first place. This led Soviet historian Iakov S. Lur&#x27;e (1968) to write of &quot;Tatishchev information&quot;, which he defined as &quot;data found only in that historian&quot;, that should be approached with skepticism and extreme caution. It is also true that he could never tell a genuine work from a fake, and some incidents inserted in his history could have been products of his own fancy.

==Memorialization==

===Places===
Several inhabited locations in Saratov Oblast, Samara Oblast and Orenburg Oblast are named after Tatishchev.

===Monuments===
* In 1998 a large equestrian statue of Tatishchev was established in Tolyatti.
* In 1998 in Yekaterinburg at Plotinka (the dam of the city pond on the Iset River) a monument was erected in honour of the founders of Yekaterinburg titled &quot;Glorious sons of Russia V.N. Tatishchev and W. de Gennin, Yekaterinburg is thankful, 1998&quot; (rus. &quot;Славным сынам России В. Н. Татищеву и В. И. де Геннину Екатеринбург благодарный 1998 год&quot;). The author of the monument is the sculptor Peter Chusovitin.

===Other===

<text>Hùng king (2879 BC – 258 BC; Chữ Hán: 雄王; (雄王) or &quot;vua Hùng&quot; (𤤰雄); &quot;Vương&quot; means &quot;king&quot; and &quot;vua&quot; means &quot;monarch; could mean emperor or king&quot;) is the title given to the ancient Vietnamese rulers of the Hồng Bàng period.

== Traditional Vietnamese account ==

=== Etymology ===
It is likely that the name Hùng Vương is a combination of the two Sino-Vietnamese words &quot;Hùng&quot; 雄 &quot;masculine, virile, fierce, powerful, grand&quot; and &quot;Vương&quot; 王, which means &quot;king&quot;. The name Hùng Vương might have originally been a title bestowed on a chieftain. The Hùng Vương was allegedly the head chieftain of Văn Lang which at the time was composed of feudal communities of rice farmers.

=== Hùng kings&#x27; narrative ===

According to the Hùng kings narrative, the eighteen Hùng kings belonged to the Hong Bang dynasty (2879–258 BCE) that ruled over the northern part of Vietnam and southern part of modern China in antiquity. Their progenitors were Lạc Long Quân and his consort Goddess Âu Cơ who produced a sac containing one hundred eggs from which one hundred sons emerged. Dragon Lord Lạc preferred to live by the sea, and Goddess Âu Cơ preferred the snow-capped mountains. The two separated with half of the sons following each parent. The most illustrious of the sons became the first Hùng king who ruled Văn Lang, the realm of all the descendants of Dragon and Goddess Âu Cơ who became the Vietnamese people, from his capital in modern Phú Thọ Province.

=== List of Hùng kings ===
== Earliest references ==

The earliest references to the Hung kings are found in early collections of &quot;Records of Nanyue&quot; or &quot;Nanyuezhi&quot; (南越志) in the 978 anthology Extensive Records of the Taiping Era. It said:
Jiaozhi&#x27;s land was very fertile. After people settled there, they began to cultivate. Its soils are black, its climate gloomy and fierce (慘雄; SV: &quot;thảm hùng). So hitherto its fields were called Hùng fields&quot; (雄田; SV: Hùng điền&quot;) and its people were Hùng people&quot; (雄民, SV: Hùng dân&quot;). Their leader was Hùng king&quot; (雄王; SV: Hùng vương), and his chief advisors were hùng lords&quot; (雄侯; SV: Hùng hầu&quot;), the lands [were] distributed to &quot;Hùng generals&quot; (雄將; SV: Hùng tướng).
However, the 4th century &quot;Almanacs of the Outer Territories of the Jiao province&quot; (交州外域記) mentioned Lạc fields, Lạc people, Lạc generals, and Lạc lords, ruled by Lạc king, instead:
During the time before Jiaozhi had commanderies and prefectures, the soil and land had Lạc fields (雒田; SV: lạc điền&quot;). These fields followed the flood&#x27;s ebbs and flows. The people cultivated these fields for foods, so they were called Lạc people (雒民; SV: Lạc dân&quot;). The Lạc King (雒王; SV: Lạc vương&quot;) and Lạc Lords (雒侯; SV: Lạc hầu&quot;) [were] established to govern all those commanderies and prefectures. [In the] prefectures many [were] made Lạc generals (雒將; SV &quot;Lạc tướng&quot;). Lạc generals [wore] copper seals and blue-green ribbons.
Therefore, French scholar Henri Maspéro and Vietnamese scholar Nguyễn Văn Tố proposed that 雄 (SV: &quot;Hùng&quot;) was actually a scribal error for 雒 (SV: &quot;Lạc&quot;).

The Hùng kings&#x27; eighteen generations (or dynasties) were mentioned in Đại Việt sử lược (大越史略 – Great Viet&#x27;s Abridged History) by an anonymous 14th-century author:

In King Zhuang of Zhou&#x27;s time, in Gia Ninh division (嘉寧部), there was a strange man, [who] could use mystical arts [to] overwhelm all the tribes; he styled [him]self Đối king (碓王, SV: Đối Vương); [His] capital was in Văn Lang, [his state&#x27;s] appellation was Văn Lang state (文郎國). Their customs were substantively honest; strings and knots [were used] for their regulations. Passing down eighteen generations, all [were] styled Đối kings.
Chinese historian Luo Xianglin, apud Lai (2013), considered 碓王 (SV: Đối Vương; lit. &quot;Pestle King&quot;) to be 雒王 (SV: Lạc Vương) erroneously transmitted.
Another early known reference is purportedly found in a story called &quot;Tale of the Mountain Spirit and Water Spirit&#x27; in the 1329 &quot;Việt Điện U Linh Tập&quot; (Collection of legends and biographies of heroes and founding spirits) compiled by Lý Tế Xuyên, where the Hung King was a mere ruler. The next earliest appearance is in the fourteenth-fifteen century &quot;Lĩnh Nam chích quáí&quot; (Arrayed Tales of Selected Oddities from South of the Passes), a collection of myths and legends compiled by various authors.

== Early 20th century textual references ==

Textual references in the early 20th century highlight that the Hùng kings were already a key part of the Vietnamese collective memory.
* The 1916 Trần Trọng Kim&#x27;s Elementary Textbook for a Brief History of Annam, the first vernacular history of Vietnam in the Vietnamese alphabet, covered the period from the Hùng kings to colonial times. (Trần Trọng Kim was an official in the education service who later became prime minister of the 1945 Japanese-sponsored Bảo Đại government.) In the book, Trần Trọng Kim uses the expression that has become one of the most popular labels for the Việt connecting them to the Hùng kings – &quot;race of the Dragon and the Fairy&quot;, and in his revised 1920 edition, &quot;children of the Fairy, grandchildren of the Dragon&quot; or &quot;the descendants of the Fairy and the Dragon&quot;. Trần Trọng Kim&#x27;s text became a standard textbook until 1954 in all parts of Vietnam.
*Phan Bội Châu, an early Vietnamese nationalist, wrote a poem in 1910 which glorifies the lineage of &quot;children of the Dragon, grandchildren of the Fairy&quot;.
*Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s biography, published in South Vietnam in 1948, mentions Ho recalling the day of the Proclamation of Independence of Vietnam on September 2, 1945, and describing it as a &quot;day to remember for twenty-five million people, the children of the Lạc and the grandchildren of Hồng&quot;.

== Historicity ==
=== Developments in the 15th century ===

Historians studying the Hùng kings have suggested that developments from the 13th to the 15th centuries explain why there was a desire by Đại Việt to incorporate the founding epic of the Hùng kings into its history.

As different groups of local elites in Jiaozhi in the 1000s and worked at the transition to an independent Đại Việt, the question of political legitimisation was an urgent one that needed tackling – especially given the lack of ancient Viet sources to base on, and after about a thousand years of Chinese rule. This explained why it attempted to reach back in time and create a mythic past for itself to serve its present political needs. Although part of the legitimisation process included eliminating colonial (Chinese) influences, ironically, it was this ease with Chinese characters and sources that caused them to utilise Chinese history and sources to validate their own.

Academics have argued that the historicization and utilisation of the Hùng kings epic can be explained by developments from the thirteenth century. Three devastating invasions – by the Mongols in the thirteenth century, the Cham in the fourteenth century, and the Ming in the fifteenth century, corresponded with the myth&#x27;s emergence and absorption into historiography. By late 1330, with social problems growing in the countryside, the Trần ruler Minh Tông started to move away from Thiền (Zen) Buddhism which did not seem to be working in its integrative function, and looked to Confucianism and antiquity. He brought the Confucian teacher Chu Văn An into the capital, and the latter&#x27;s emphasis on the classical beliefs of China and its antiquity set the intellectual tone of Thang-long. Antiquity was now seen as providing solutions for the difficult present. The disastrous invasion by the Cham under Chế Bồng Nga destroyed the Trần dynasty, and caused Vietnamese literati to seek desperately for a means to restore harmony. The Ming occupation of 1407–1427 dramatically deepened the influence of the literati through promoting schools and scholarship.

Developments from the thirteenth century then combined to set the stage for the state promotion of the Hùng king founding myth by the 15th century. There was a shift away from a more indigenous, pre-Southeast Asian phase, to the &#x27;Neo-Confucian revolution&quot; of Lê Thánh Tông. This, together with the chaos created by the devastating invasions and internal social problems, encouraged a search for &#x27;Vietnamese Antiquity&#x27; modelled on classical Chinese antiquity, in the mythic creation of &#x27;Văn Lang&#x27; via the Hùng king.

=== Canonization in Ngô Sĩ Liên&#x27;s Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư (Complete Book of the Historical Records of Đại Việt) ===

The canonization of the Hùng kings founding myth was carried out by Ngô Sĩ Liên in his compiling of a new history of the realm under the order of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông (1460–97), drawing upon popular sources. This history, the &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; (Complete Book of the Historical Records of Đại Việt), was used by the emperor as a tool to promote Việt &#x27;national feeling&#x27;. Thus, Ngô Sĩ Liên was tasked to promote Đại Việt&#x27;s supernatural and millennial ancestry. This marked the first time a Việt state traced its origins back to the first realm of Văn Lang of the Hùng kings, calculated by Ngô Sĩ Liên to be in 2879 BCE. Prior to this, official dynastic histories of the Việt started with Triệu Đà, acknowledging a Qin general as the founder of the &quot;Nam Việt.&quot; This was done based mostly on &quot;da su&quot; (chronicles) and in particular, the Arrayed Tales. Court historians in the later dynasties followed Ngô Sĩ Liên&#x27;s example in integrating the Hùng kings into Việt official historiography.

=== Dissemination of Hùng kings epic from the 15th century ===

There was likely already a long oral tradition in the Red River Delta of the re-enactment of myths and legends at the level of the village even before myths were written into literature. Each village held yearly festivities at the communal temple with public recitations and re-enactments (&quot;diễn xướng&quot;) during which villagers recreated a specific myth, historical event, or character. Thus, Hùng kings worship may have existed locally before the 15th century, manifesting in the construction of temples and shrines, and in oral propagation of different variations of the Hùng kings epic.

Emperor Lê Thánh Tông authorised in 1470 the &quot;Hùng Vương ngọc phả thập bát thế truyền&quot; (Precious genealogy of the eighteen reigns of the Hùng Kings). The text was reproduced in the successive dynasties, and court-issued copies were worshipped in village temples. Spirit promulgation was promoted by imperial decrees and intensified as the dynasties passed. In the 16th and 17th century, court academicians compiled, recopied, and modified collections of myths and genealogies about supernatural beings and national heroes, including that of the Hùng kings. This were then accepted and perpetuated by villages. The Hùng kings were transformed into Thành hoàng (tutelary god) sanctified by imperial orders and by popular feeling stemming from long traditions of ancestor worship.

Over time, the worship of Hùng kings evolved; they acquired sons-in-laws who became Mountain Spirits, when migrating south with the territorial expansion, and transformed themselves into Whale Spirits when near the sea. Land was also provided to temples in Phú Thọ province, the site of the main Hung temple, to meet the expense of Hùng kings worship. As late as 1945, the Nguyễn court continued to delegate officials to oversee rituals in the Hùng kings temples of Phú Thọ. Nguyễn Thị Diệu argues that as the result of the meeting of the two currents, that of the state&#x27;s mythographic construction and that of popular, village-based animistic worship, the Hùng kings came to be venerated as the ancestral founders of the Việt nation in temples throughout the Red River Delta and beyond. 
The dissemination of the Hùng kings myth was also facilitated by the use of the lục bát (six-eight) verse form – tales recounted using this form, aided with the use of Quốc Âm (National Sound) instead of Literary Chinese, and the use of colourful verse close to the vernacular, allowed for the ease of memorisation and transmission of such myths.

=== Hùng kings in South Vietnam/Republic of Vietnam (RVN) ===

The Hùng kings seem to have been well embedded in Vietnamese collective memory by the 1950s in the RVN. Olga Dror has written about how the perception of the Hùng kings as common ancestors of all Vietnamese was mobilised for various agendas despite admitting a lack of historical evidence about them.

Just like in the DRV and SRV, the RVN also commemorated the Hùng kings&#x27; in a national holiday. The Hùng kings Memorial Day was one of the twenty official holidays at the inception of the RVN but was dropped in January 1956 from the official list as Ngô Đình Diệm as prime minister decided that citizens would not have time off for the holiday. The Hùng kings was hence rejected at the official level. However, at the public level, commemorations were allowed. The Saigon News Review and the Vietnam News Agency reported on celebrations around the state with the participation of many officials.

With the assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm and changes in the RVN government, the Hùng kings Memorial Day was restored to the list of official holidays in February 1964, allocating a whole day off for government employees and students. The Hùng kings Memorial Day became one of the seven official holidays in the RVN with a full day of rest. In an April 1964 decree, the Hùng kings Memorial Day also became one of the four holidays requiring private businesses to give their employees paid time off. This elevated the status of the Hùng kings and highlighted their importance for official discourse.

Perhaps the most important indication of the Hùng kings Memorial Day&#x27;s significance is that it was a contender for the honour of being designated as National Day. In 1967, the National Assembly considered whether the Hùng kings Memorial Day should also be made Independence Day. While the initiative failed, the idea was surfaced again in the Senate in 1971 and discussed in the cabinet in 1973.

=== Hùng kings in North Vietnam/Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV)&#x27;s national history ===

The conversion of the Hùng kings to historical &quot;truth&quot; in the DRV emerged over time through extensive discussions by DRV official scholars and resolutions by the Party such as regarding the establishment of the date of the death anniversary of the Hùng kings and its celebration in festivals. The Institute of Archaeology was established in 1968 with the highest priority given to scientifically documenting the Hùng kings. The Institute launched excavations and organised conferences between 1968 and 1971 to discuss the findings and published their proceedings.

Historian Patricia Pelley posits that the selection of the Hùng Kings and the Hung dynasty during the Văn Lang period was part of Hanoi&#x27;s quest to create a &quot;cult of antiquity&quot; to illustrate the historical longevity and prestige of Vietnam that predated the Chinese occupation. The transformation of the Hùng kings into historical fact was based on the conflation of different kinds of evidence such as archaeological remains, dynastic chronicles, collections of legends, and a poem attributed to Hồ Chí Minh titled &quot;The History of Vietnam from 2879 BCE to 1945&quot;.

DRV scholar and the first president of the Institute of History, Trần Huy Liệu, settled the question of the origins of the Vietnamese nation in an article on the Hùng kings. The article noted that on the &quot;tenth day of the third lunar month, the central government and local government held an official ceremony to commemorate the death anniversary of our Hung king ancestors at the Temple of the Hùng kings.&quot; He commented that the Hùng kings were the &quot;origins of the nation&quot; as they &quot;built the country&quot;, and &quot;if there had been no Hùng kings, then there would be no Đinh, Lê, Lý, Trần, Hồ, or Nguyễn, and also no Democratic Republic of Vietnam&quot;. Trần Huy Liệu also wrote that the &quot;patriotic spirit and indomitable tradition of our nation broke out in the thousand years of Chinese feudal rule, and it broke out in the hundred years under the domination of the French colonizers.&quot; He concluded by lamenting that &quot;at this time our lovely country has been provisionally divided into two regions and our fellow countrymen in the South moan and writhe under the fascist regime of the gang of Ngô Đình Diệm, lackey of the American imperialists.&quot;

Historian Cherry Haydon notes that this article is important for a few reasons. First, it highlights the direct link made between the period of the Hùng kings and the formation of the Vietnamese nation. Second, it dates the origins of Vietnamese resistance to foreign aggression to the founding of the nation; third, it states explicitly the continuity between the period of the Hùng kings and the present. The dating of the origins of the nation to the rule of the Hùng kings would eventually become the orthodox position of historians at the Research Committee, the Institute of History, and later the Institute of Archaeology.

=== Hùng kings and the Bronze Age ===
Bronze Age relics have been used to support the existence of the kingdom of Van Lang and the Hùng kings. The official DRV national history, &quot;Lịch Sử Việt Nam&quot;, published in 1971, asserted the connection between the Bronze Age and the Dong Son culture and the period of the Hùng kings.

However, Haydon Cherry has argued that contrary to the assertions of Vietnamese scholars, such relics cannot provide such a support. He notes that the earliest Vietnamese text to describe this kingdom, the &quot;Đại Việt sử lược&quot;, dates from the thirteenth century, eighteen hundred years after the kingdom it is supposed to describe. The earliest Chinese text, which mentions not the Hung but the Lac kings, dates from the fourth century CE, eight hundred years after the period it discusses. Hence, such texts are not reliable transmissions of any written or oral tradition over eight or eighteen hundred years.

=== Hùng kings as &quot;invented tradition&quot; ===

Analyses of the earliest sources on the Hùng kings have illustrated problems with these sources that have been used as historical evidence of the existence of the Hùng kings. In particular, historians have examined the Lĩnh Nam chích quái liệt truyện (Arrayed Tales of Selected Oddities from South of the Passes), compiled by Trần Thế Pháp under the late-fourteenth-century Trần dynasty, and amended in the fifteenth century under the Lê dynasty by Vũ Quỳnh and Kiều Phú. This source is of great importance in providing core information for Ngo Si Lien&#x27;s Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư (Complete Book of the Historical Records of Đại Việt) created in 1479, which marked the official transformation of the Hùng kings into the founders of dynasties. The Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư was in turn the core text that DRV historians used as proof of the ancient origins of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese nation.

Based on an analysis of an essay called &quot;Biography of the Hồng Bàng Clan&quot; from the Arrayed Tales, historian Liam Kelley posits that the Hùng kings did not exist. Instead, he argues that they were invented in the medieval period when the Sinicised elite in the Red River Delta first constructed a separate identity in relation to China&#x27;s cultural heritage. Kelley exposes the problems of the &quot;Biography&quot; in a few ways – for example, by showing how it borrowed figures and accounts from ancient Chinese texts and stories, and by highlighting issues with terms such as &quot;Hùng&quot;, &quot;Lạc&quot;, and &quot;Việt&quot;. He does this by examining ancient Chinese historical sources to highlight similar terms and stories as in &quot;Biography&quot;, and search for terms and accounts mentioned in &quot;Biography&quot; to corroborate the existence of the latter&#x27;s information on the Hùng Kings. In doing so he also shows how this practice of drawing upon old texts for material to create a local history was also practiced at that time in parts of the Chinese empire like Sichuan and Guangdong, hence placing the &quot;Biography&quot; in the broader literary trends of the time.

== Cultural significance ==
=== National Identity ===

The Hùng kings are perceived as the founders of the Viet civilisation, and are promoted by the government as a source of national pride and solidarity through platforms such as the state-sponsored commemoration of an annual holiday, the Hùng kings Temple Festival, to honour the Hùng kings, and the promotion of the Hung King National Museum in Việt Trì City. In the Museum of Vietnamese History in Ho Chi Minh City, the exhibits are arranged chronologically, with the first one on the &quot;Rise of the Hùng kings&quot;.

=== Worship of Hùng kings ===
==== Revival of worship of Hùng kings ====

With the Đổi Mới reforms from 1986, Vietnam saw a resurrection of traditional festivals, including the Hùng kings Temple Festival. Celebrations of the Hùng kings moved from the local to the provincial and then to the state levels. This revival has been perceived as an attempt by the government to maintain the Vietnamese identity of its people in view of increasing foreign influence.

In 1999, the government issued a directive on the celebration on what it perceived as the most important events in 2000. Other than the Hùng kings Festival, the other events perceived to be important were: the seventieth anniversary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the 110th anniversary of Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s birthday, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the victory in the campaign against Americans to save the country, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the August Revolution, and the start of the twenty-first century.

The Hùng Kings&#x27; Temple Festival (Vietnamese: &quot;Giỗ Tổ Hùng Vương&quot; or &quot;lễ hội đền Hùng&quot;) is a Vietnamese festival held annually from the 8th to the 11th days of the third lunar month in honour of the Hùng Kings. The main festival day – which has been designated a public holiday in Vietnam since 2007 – is on the 10th day.

Every year, leading government figures make pilgrimages to the Hùng kings temple in Phú Thọ province to honour the Quốc tộ (National Founder).

In April 2016, the festival at the Hùng kings temple in Phú Thọ attracted about seven million people. Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the general secretary of the Communist Party, also attended.

In 2018, the state-established Association for Liaison with Overseas Vietnamese (ALOV) implemented a project titled Vietnam Ancestral Global Day which organised various cultural activities worldwide to celebrate Hung Kings Memorial Day. This year is the first time that Vietnam Ancestral Global Day has been celebrated simultaneously in many European countries following a shared format. Since 2015, one of the three main goals of the Vietnam Ancestral Global Day Project has been to preserve and spread the Hùng kings worship rite amongst overseas Vietnamese.

==== UNESCO recognition ====

In 2012, the worship of the Hùng kings in Phú Thọ was recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and the UNESCO page notes that this &quot;tradition embodies spiritual solidarity and provides an occasion to acknowledge national origins and sources of Vietnamese cultural and moral identity&quot;.

<doc id="1004372" wikidata="Q1070054" url="?curid=1004372" title="Changing room">
<text>A changing room, locker room (usually in a sports, theater, or staff context), or changeroom (regional use) is a room or area designated for changing one&#x27;s clothes. Changing-rooms are provided in a semi-public situation to enable people to change clothes with varying degrees of privacy.
A fitting room, or dressing room, is a room where people try on clothes, such as in a department store.

Separate changing rooms may be provided for men and women, or there may be a non-gender-specific open space with individual cubicles or stalls, as with unisex public toilets. Many changing rooms include toilets, sinks and showers. Sometimes a changing room exists as a small portion of a restroom/washroom. For example, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s washrooms in Toronto&#x27;s Yonge–Dundas Square (which includes a water play area) each include a change area which is a blank counter space at the end of a row of sinks. In this case, the facility is primarily a washroom, and its use as a changing room is minimal, since only a small percentage of users change into bathing suits. Sometimes a person may change their clothes in a toilet cubicle of a washroom. 
Larger changing rooms are usually found at public beaches, or other bathing areas, where most of the space is for changing, and minimal washroom space is included. Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls. Some do not have a roof, providing just the barrier necessary to prevent people outside from seeing in.

==Types==

Various types of changing rooms exist:

* Changing stalls are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. They are used for any physical activity.
* Locker rooms are usually gender-specific spaces where clothes are changed and stored in lockers. They are often used for swimming or other sporting purposes. They are open spaces with no stalls. These rooms include toilets, sinks, and showers.
* Fitting rooms, or dressing rooms, are usually small single-user-cubicles where a person may try on clothes. These are often found at retail stores where one would want to try on clothes before purchasing them.

===Changing stalls===
Changing stalls are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. Clothes are usually stored in lockers. There are usually no separate areas for men and women. They are often combined with gender-separated communal showers. Most public pools have changing facilities of this kind alongside communal changing-rooms. Some other places also offer these changing stalls such as fitness centers.

===Communal changing rooms===

Locker rooms are thus named because they provide lockers for the storage of one&#x27;s belongings. Alternatively, they may have a locker room attendant who will keep a person&#x27;s belongings until one comes to retrieve them. Locker rooms are usually open spaces where people change together, but there are separate areas, or separate locker rooms, for men and women. Sometimes they are used in swimming complexes.

Locking devices used in locker rooms have traditionally been key or coin lockers, or lockers that are secured with a combination lock. Newer locker rooms may be automated, with robotic machines to store clothes, with such features as a fingerprint scanner to enroll and for later retrieval. Locker rooms in some water parks use a microchip equipped wristband. The same wristband that unlocks the lockers can be used to purchase food and drinks and other items in the water park.

Some communal changing rooms are only supposed to be used by groups of persons, not individuals. In this case, there may be no lockers. Instead, the entire room is locked in order to protect belongings from theft.

Locker rooms are also used in many middle schools and high schools. Most of them include showers for after Physical Education.

At an outdoor sports facility, the changing rooms may be integrated into a pavilion or clubhouse, with other facilities such as seating or a bar.

===(Store) fitting rooms===
Fitting rooms, or dressing rooms, are rooms where people try on clothes, such as in a department store. The rooms are usually individual rooms in which a person tries on clothes to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of clothes and put on another. Sometimes a person chooses to try on clothes over their clothes (such as sweaters or coats), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.

====Rules and conventions====
Retail establishments often post rules such as maximum number of items allowed in changing room, e.g. &quot;no more than 4 items allowed in changing room&quot;.

==== History ====
It appears that the first store fitting rooms appeared with the spread of department stores. Émile Zola noted their existence in his novel &quot;Au Bonheur des Dames&quot; (1883), and that they were then forbidden to men. Some years later, when Henri Gervex, who painted Jeanne Paquin in 1906, that was no longer the case.

In any case, Buster Keaton worked in one in an American 1928 silent comedy &quot;The Cameraman&quot;. Since then, they have continued to provide comic scenes in films, for example in the 1995 French film &quot;Les Trois Frères&quot;.

===Dressing rooms (domestic)===

Some homes may have dedicated rooms solely for the purpose of dressing and changing clothes, typically with fitted wardrobes. In larger Victorian houses it was common to have a private room called a &quot;boudoir&quot; for the lady of the house that is accessible from the bedroom, and also a dressing room for the gentleman (and sometimes a man&#x27;s cabinet).

==Security==
Because of the privacy afforded by changing rooms, they create a problem in the trade-off between security and privacy, where in it may be possible for crime to be perpetrated by people using the cover of privacy to sell drugs, or steal clothing from a department store. Some department stores have security cameras in the changing rooms.

Communal changing rooms pose less of a risk of theft than fitting rooms, because there is not total privacy. In particular, the perpetrator of a crime would not know whether or not other users might be undercover police or security guards. Many modern changing rooms often have labyrinth-style entrances that have no door, so that people outside cannot see in, but security can walk in at any time without the sound of an opening door alerting persons inside. Washrooms in which changing clothes is merely a secondary purpose often also have such labyrinth openings. Many washrooms have security cameras in the main area with a view of the sinks and the urinals from a viewing angle that would only show the back of a user. However, when a washroom is located near a fountain, wading pool, or the like, and is likely to be used for changing clothes, some believe that washroom surveillance cameras would be a violation of privacy.

Another security risk present is that of theft. Sometimes, no method of securing items is provided, but even lockable lockers or baskets are usually designed for only minimal security allowing experienced thieves to steal the valuable items which people typically have with them before changing. Changing room operators frequently post signs disclaiming responsibility for stolen items, which can discourage but not eliminate claims for negligence.

<text>Capstone Software was a subsidiary of IntraCorp, a Miami-based computer and video game company. Founded in 1984, Capstone created first-person games such as &quot;Corridor 7: Alien Invasion&quot;, &quot;Operation Body Count&quot;, &quot;William Shatner&#x27;s TekWar&quot; and &quot;Witchaven&quot;, and is also known for releasing games based on movie/TV licenses. Capstone&#x27;s first-person games used the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine, and later, the Build engine.

IntraCorp went bankrupt in 1996 and shut down all its operations, including Capstone Software. Capstone&#x27;s last game, &quot;Corridor 8: Galactic Wars&quot;, never left the prototype stage and was never released. Capstone became VRTech, providing first-person buildouts of new construction condominiums using the Build engine. It eventually closed down.

<text>Migrant Help is a United Kingdom-based national charity that has been supporting migrants since 1963.

The charity operates from 10 offices across the United Kingdom, providing advice, guidance and support to people seeking asylum, refugees and victims of modern-day slavery and human trafficking. Asylum support services include face-to-face advice both in initial accommodation centers and on an outreach basis, along with a nationwide telephone service. Most people seeking asylum have fled war or persecution and many arrive with limited understanding of life in the UK. Migrant Help provides them with advice, information and support to negotiate the asylum system, access services and overcome the challenges of integration.

Migrant Help works on Syrian Resettlement programs with local authorities in South East England, welcoming new families to the UK and supporting and orienting them to their new communities over an extended period. The charity supports access to local healthcare and education services, English lessons, specialist counselling, managing budgets and becoming work ready.

Migrant Help also supports victims of modern-day slavery and human trafficking in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The charity works with a number of organisations around the UK including local authorities, strategic partners and volunteer groups on community-based schemes.

== Clear Voice ==
Clear Voice is a trading subsidiary of Migrant Help that delivers professional interpreting and translation services. Clear Voice interpreters work extensively with refugees and people seeking asylum.

Clear Voice was established by Migrant Help in 2008 to provide high quality, cost-effective language services. Clear Voice specialises in the provision of telephone interpreting, face-to-face interpreting and translation services across the UK.

All of Clear Voice’s profits are returned to Migrant Help, supporting the parent charity’s work. In 2022, Clear Voice delivered over 9.3 million minutes of telephone interpreting. This resulted in a donation of £1.7 million to Migrant Help.

== History ==
=== Kent Committee for the Welfare of Migrants ===
The charity now known as Migrant Help was set up in 1963 by Helen Ellis MBE, a leading figure in the provision of welfare support to migrants travelling through the Port of Dover. The organisation, known at this time as the Kent Committee for the Welfare of Migrants (KCWM), was established in response to the growing number of migrants arriving at the Channel Ports.

In 1970, immigrants were given right of appeal against decisions relating to their entry. The United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service (UKIAS), funded by the Home Office, was established to represent migrants on &#x27;appeal&#x27;. KCWM worked alongside the UKIAS to support the welfare of migrants arriving at the ports in Kent.

=== Migrant Helpline ===
In 1993, Helen Ellis retired after 50 years of service to migrants. In the following year (1994), the charity adopted the new name of Migrant Helpline. That same year, the charity received a grant from the Home Office to deliver support services to newly arrived people seeking asylum.

In 2002, Migrant Helpline was asked by the Home Office to establish and operate the first Induction Center. Here, briefings were delivered to people seeking asylum about the asylum process and their rights and responsibilities. Migrant Helpline&#x27;s operation expanded to London and a reception service for people seeking asylum opened in Croydon. The charity was funded to manage the London accommodation center for newly arrived people seeking asylum, known as &#x27;Emergency Initial Accommodation&#x27;.

A number of projects were established in the following years including the &#x27;Sunrise&#x27; project to help new refugees integrate into life in the UK, a &#x27;Training and Employment&#x27; project was launched for refugees in Kent (until 2009) and Migrant Helpline was invited to provide an independent advisory service to foreign national prisoners in Canterbury Prison.

The &#x27;European Migrant Advice&#x27; service was established in response to an increased need for support for EU migrants. This service was later extended in 2010 to meet support needs in Suffolk and Norfolk.

In 2008, the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Center approached the charity to provide support for victims of labour exploitation. The Victims of Slavery Support Service team was established.

=== Migrant Help ===
In 2010, Migrant Helpline became known as Migrant Help. The charity continues to work to improve the lives of vulnerable migrants in partnership with other organisations and community groups. Migrant Help was shortlisted for Charity Awards in 2016 for innovation in advice and support to people seeking asylum.

==Funding==
Migrant Help has received significant Home Office funding since 1994. In 2019, it secured a £100 million contract to run the Home Office system called “Advice, Issue Reporting and Eligibility (AIRE)” services, and act as the official point of contact for refugees to get advice on their asylum claims. In 2021, the value of this Home Office contract rose to £235 million.

== Projects ==
Throughout its lifetime Migrant Help has participated in a number of programs supporting migrants and refugees. These projects have been undertaken both independently and in association with other organisations, in particular the Home Office.

== Employment ==
Migrant Help employs 454 people from 40 different countries of origin. Approximately 47% of staff are non-UK born and many have personal experiences of the refugee journey.

Migrant Help holds the &quot;Investors in People&quot; accreditation, is authorised by the Office of Immigration Services Commissioner, holds an Advice Quality Standard mark and is a National Living Wage employer.

<text>is a city in Rumoi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 18,132 in 10519 households, and a population density of 61 people per km2. The total area of the city is . There are several theories about the origin of the name, which comes from the Ainu word for the Rumoi River. The word &quot;rur-mo-ot-pe,&quot; means &quot;a river with calm, constant tides,&quot; or &quot;a river with deep tides,&quot; and this theory has been adopted by the city.

==Geography==
Rumoi is located in the south of Rumoi Subprefecture, on the coast of the Sea of Japan. Rumoi River flows through the city.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
* Hokkaido
** Mashike

===Average wind speed by month===
(Annual average: )
===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Rumoi is as shown below. The city is in a long period of sustained population loss.

==History==
Rumoi was developed by herring fishery and mining.
*1869: Rurumoppe was renamed Rumoi.
*1877: The village of Rumoi was founded.
*1902: The villages of Rumoi and Reuke were merged to form Rumoi Village.
*1907: Sandomari village was merged into Rumoi village.
*1908: Rumoi village became Rumoi town.
*1914: The capital of Mashike Subprefecture was transferred from Mashike to Rumoi and Mashike Subprefecture was renamed Rumoi Subprefecture.
*1919: Obirashibe village (now Obira town) was split off.
*1945: Rumoi was designated as the site of the proposed Soviet invasion of Hokkaido, with a plan to occupy the island from Rumoi in the west to Kushiro in the east. The plan was cancelled.
*1947: Rumoi town became Rumoi city.
==Government==
Rumoi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 14 members. Rumoi, as part of Rumoi sub-prefecture, contributes one member to the Hokkaidō Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Hokkaidō 10th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Rumoi is he central city of the Rumoi region. Its main industries are commerce, civil engineering, and seafood processing. Rumoi Port is still used for landing Pacific herring, and is the largest processing center in Japan for &quot;kazunoko&quot; herring roe. 

Until the 1900s, Rumoi was a fishing town that relied solely on herring fishing, with a permanent population of just under 40,000 and over 30,000 migrant workers, and a very lively entertainment district. Since the 1910s, the development of coal mines progressed. After the depletion of herring resources in 1950, Mitsui &amp; Co. and others began importing fish roe and other products from overseas for seafood processing companies, and lumber processing companies in the city also began importing northern timber in the 1950s, so the city&#x27;s economy has been based on commerce, fishing and mining since 1950. In the 1960s, the coal mines were closed and in the 1970s, local seafood processing companies gradually lost market share to factories in Sapporo and the Tokyo metropolitan area, which are located near major consumer areas. In the 1980s, the city began to develop ports, roads, and waste disposal facilities to accommodate the unemployed leading to a rapid expansion in the issuance of city bonds. By the 1990s, wood processing companies went out of business or moved overseas, almost eliminating economic activity in the city. The government, which the city relied on, also retreated one after another, with the Rumoi Maritime Bureau moving to Asahikawa and the Rumoi Coast Guard Station integrating with Otaru. Since the 1990s, the city&#x27;s economy has become government-dependent, dependent on public servants&#x27; salaries and public works. According to the 2000 census, the proportion of employees in the tertiary industry, including public servants, was overwhelmingly high, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of employees, with secondary industry accounting for 30%. Primary industry only accounted for a little over 3%.

Rumoi has five public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Hokkaidō Board of Education.

===High school===
* Hokkaido Rumoi High School

<doc id="1004391" wikidata="Q459875" url="?curid=1004391" title="Kartli">
<text>Kartli ( ) is a historical region in central-to-eastern Georgia traversed by the river Mtkvari (Kura), on which Georgia&#x27;s capital, Tbilisi, is situated. Known to the Classical authors as Iberia, Kartli played a crucial role in the ethnic and political consolidation of the Georgians in the Middle Ages. Kartli had no strictly defined boundaries and they significantly fluctuated in the course of history. After the partition of the kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Kartli became a separate kingdom with its capital at Tbilisi. The historical lands of Kartli are currently divided among several administrative regions of Georgia.

The Georgians living in the historical lands of Kartli are known as Kartlelebi (ქართლელები), sing. Kartleli (ქაერთლელი) and comprise one of the largest geographic subgroups of the Georgian people. Most of them are Eastern Orthodox Christians adhering to the national Georgian Orthodox Church and speak a dialect which is the basis of the modern Georgian literary language.

== Etymology ==

The toponym &quot;Kartli&quot; first emerges in written accounts in the 5th-century &quot;Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik&quot;, the earliest surviving piece of Georgian literature. According to the medieval &quot;Georgian Chronicles&quot;, Kartli derives its name from Kartlos, the mythic Georgian ethnarch, who built a city on the Mtkvari; it was called Kartli (probably at the latter-day Armazi), a name which generalized to the country ruled by Kartlos and his progeny. Kartlos seems to be a medieval contrivance and his being the eponymous founder of Kartli is not convincing. The medieval chronicler characteristically renders this name with the Greek nominative suffix –ος (&quot;os&quot;), as Stephen H. Rapp of Georgia State University (Atlanta) assumes, &quot;in order to impart the account with a sense of antiquity&quot;.

The term itself ultimately derives from Proto-Kartvelian root &quot;*kart-&quot; (&quot;Georgian&quot;), which is considered an ancient inner-Kartvelian formation by modern linguists. See and for more.

However, professor Giorgi Melikishvili has linked the toponym Kartli with a word &quot;karta&quot; (), found in Mingrelian (a Kartvelian language related to Georgian) and in some western Georgian dialects and meaning &quot;a cattle pen&quot; or &quot;an enclosed place&quot;. The root &quot;kar&quot; occurs in numerous placenames across Georgia and, in the opinion of Melikishvili, displays semantic similarity with the Indo-European prototype; cf. Germanic &quot;gardaz&quot; (&quot;enclosure&quot;, &quot;garden&quot;), Lithuanian &quot;gardas&quot; (&quot;enclosure&quot;, &quot;hurdle&quot;, &quot;cattle pen&quot;), Old Slavic &quot;gradu&quot; (&quot;garden&quot;, also &quot;city&quot;), and Hittite &quot;gurtas&quot; (&quot;fortress&quot;). Relationships have also been sought with the Khaldi and Carduchi of the Classical sources.

== Early history ==
The formation of Kartli and its people, the Kartveli (ქართველი) is poorly documented. The infiltration of several ancient, chiefly Anatolian, tribes into the territory of modern-day Georgia and their fusion with the autochthons played a decisive role in this process. This might have been reflected in the story of Arian-Kartli, the semi-legendary place of the aboriginal Georgian habitat found in the early medieval chronicle &quot;Conversion of Kartli&quot;.

During the 3rd century BC, Kartli and its original capital Mtskheta (succeeded by Tbilisi during the 5th century) formed a nucleus around which the ancient Georgian kingdom known to the Greco-Romans as Iberia evolved. The role of Kartli as a core ethnic and political unit which would form a basis for the subsequent Georgian unification further increased as a result of its Christianization early in the 4th century. Located in an area influenced by both the Byzantine and Iranian civilizations, Kartli developed a Christian culture, aided by the fact that it was the only Kartvelian area with its own written language. With the consolidation of Arab rule in Tbilisi during the 8th century, the political capital of Kartli shifted to its southwest, but the Georgian literati of that time afforded to Kartli a broader meaning to denote all those lands of medieval Georgia that were alike by religion, culture, and language. In one of the most-quoted passages of medieval Georgian literature, the 9th-century writer Giorgi Merchule asserts: &quot;And Kartli consists of that spacious land in which the liturgy and all prayers are said in the Georgian language. But [only] the &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; is said in Greek, [the phrase] which means in Georgian &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; or &quot;Lord, be merciful to us&quot;.
After the unification of various Georgian polities into the kingdom of Georgia early during the 11th century, the names &quot;Kartli&quot; and &quot;Kartveli&quot; became a basis of the Georgian self-designation &quot;Sakartvelo&quot;. The Georgian circumfix &quot;sa&quot;-X-&quot;o&quot; is a standard geographic construction designating &quot;the area where X dwell&quot;, where X is an ethnonym.

== Medieval subdivision ==

During the Middle Ages, Kartli was traditionally divided, approximately along the river Mtkvari, into the three principal regions:
*Shida Kartli (შიდა ქართლი), i.e., Inner Kartli, centered on Mtskheta and Uplistsikhe comprising all of central Kartli north and south of the Mtkvari and west of its tributary, the Aragvi;
*Kvemo Kartli (ქვემო ქართლი), i.e., Lower Kartli, comprising the lands in the lower basin of the Mtkvari and south of that river;
*Zemo Kartli (ზემო ქართლი), i.e., Upper Kartli, comprising the lands in the upper basin of the Mtkvari and south of that river, west of Kvemo Kartli.

Most of these lands are now part of Georgia&#x27;s regions of Shida Kartli (of which Gori is the capital) and Kvemo Kartli (with its capital at Rustavi), but also of Samtskhe-Javakheti (of which Akhaltsikhe its capital), and Mtskheta-Mtianeti (Mtskheta is the capital). A significant portion of Zemo Kartli is now part of Turkey.

== Later history ==

With the fragmentation of the kingdom of Georgia during the 15th century, the kings of Georgia were left with Kartli alone, having Tbilisi as their capital. The kings of Kartli did not relinquish the titles of the all-Georgian monarchs whose legitimate successors they claimed to be. The Europeans, thus, knew it as &quot;Georgia proper&quot; and later also as Kartalinia via the Russian Карталиния . Similarly, the toponym Gorjestān (Georgia) was usually used in Persian in the narrower sense of Kartli.

The kingdom of Kartli was a battleground of the Ottoman-Safavid wars, conflicts among neighboring Georgian and Caucasian rulers, and of its own civil wars into the 18th century. Beginning from 1550, and more strictly since 1614, the Georgian rulers pursued the &quot;politics of compromise&quot; with their Persian overlords. This implied that Persia allowed Kartli or any other region ruled by them to retain a considerable autonomy and the Georgian dynasty of Bagratids to possess the royal throne provided they adopted Islam and remained subordinate to the shah. In Georgian documents, the Georgian rulers continued to be styled as kings, while Persian official documents referred to them as the wāli (&quot;viceroy&quot;) of Gorjestān, emphasizing their subservience to the shah. Many members of the aristocratic elite of Kartli had important positions in the Persian military and administration and several noble women entered the shah&#x27;s harems. This situation changed in 1745, when, with the permission of Nāder Shah, Teimuraz II was crowned as king of Kartli according to Christian customs. In 1748, Kartli became essentially independent, with only formal side of Persian vassalage still observed. In 1762, Kartli was united with the neighboring eastern Georgian kingdom of Kakheti into a single state, which became a Russian protectorate in 1783, but it suffered a devastating Persian invasion in 1795, when Agha Mohammad Khan of Persia&#x27;s newly established Qajar dynasty sought to bring Georgia again under Persian hegemony. The weakened kingdom was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801 and this new rearrangement was confirmed by the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813 following the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813).

<text>Andrew de Guldeford was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports at some time between 1364 and 1376, probably from 1371 to 1372.

On 28 August 1343, King Edward III ruled on an action involving de Guldeford which was regarded as piracy. English conflict with Scotland had made the Isle of Man a target for the Scots who had made demands on the community for monies to keep the peace. Three hundred marks were dispatched in two ships bound for Scotland with livestock and other goods. The fine was for the period of one year, but was intercepted before it reached Scotland by de Guldeford of Waterford, and his accomplices, including John de Bristol and Thomas Sloghtre of Ulton. John Jolens and his son Robert, Adam Serle of Drogheda, and Hugh Pyrotson of Ulton, were also named as being present, with three ships from Ireland.
De Guldeford claimed his ships to be amongst &#x27;the guardians of the sea&#x27;, but offered no warrant or authority to this effect, and proceeded to board the Manx ships by force of arms, removing the money, and goods, and taking away with him one of the Manx ships. Further, the pirates carried off a number of the Manx men with them back to Ireland, where they were imprisoned.

De Guldeford later served as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Piracy is a charge often levelled against the Cinque Ports during the 14th century. It is not certain that de Guldeford was at the time of the incident in any way associated with the Cinque Ports.

<text>The domain name arpa is a top-level domain (TLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It is used predominantly for the management of technical network infrastructure. Prominent among such functions are the subdomains &quot;in-addr.arpa&quot; and &quot;ip6.arpa&quot;, which provide namespaces for reverse DNS lookup of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively.

The name originally was the acronym for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the funding organization in the United States that developed the ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet. It was the first domain defined for the network in preparation for a hierarchical naming system for the delegation of authority, autonomy, and responsibility. It was originally intended only to serve in a temporary function for facilitating the systematic naming of the ARPANET computers. However, it became practically difficult to remove the domain after infrastructural uses had been sanctioned. As a result, the name was redefined as the backronym Address and Routing Parameter Area.

Domain-name registrations in arpa are not possible, and new subdomains are infrequently added by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

==Purpose==
Each computer using the Internet Protocol is identified by a numerical IP address for identification and location addressing. Each host is also assigned a more memorable hostname, which often relates to the purpose or ownership of the host, and is used more conveniently in user interaction with network functions, such as when connecting to or accessing a resource. Originally, the mapping between names and addresses was a cumbersome mechanical process using lookup tables distributed as computer files between network administrators. The Domain Name System (DNS) solved this inefficiency by automating the lookup function with a hierarchical naming system using domain names. When a user requests a network service using a domain name, the protocol implementation (&quot;protocol stack&quot;) translates the name to an address that can be used to reach a remote host.

This naming function, often called &quot;forward resolution&quot;, was the original purpose of the top-level domain &quot;ARPA&quot;. It was the first domain defined in the first naming system of the nascent Internet, and was supposed to be an initial container domain for all then-existing ARPANET hosts. The next stage of development of the naming architecture foresaw the establishment of specific domains for other purposes based on certain requirements.

===Reverse IP address mapping===
In many applications the reverse of the name-to-address mapping is also required. The host receiving a service request may require the domain name of the originating computer, for example, to customize the service, or for verification purposes. This latter function, called Reverse DNS lookup, is implemented in the major uses of the domain &quot;arpa&quot;: its subdomains &quot;in-addr.arpa&quot; for Internet Protocol version 4, and &quot;ip6.arpa&quot; for IPv6.

Conceptually similar lookup and mapping functionality is provided by other subdomains of &quot;arpa&quot; for specific types of data.

===Telephone number mapping===
The domain e164.arpa provides a lookup function that retrieves information associated with telephone numbers through the ENUM service. This service may be used to obtain the name of a computer that is capable of routing telecommunication requests for a registered telephone number, or obtain an email address to contact the subscriber of a specific telephone number.

===Residential networking===
The domain name &quot;home.arpa&quot; was reserved by the Internet Engineering task force in May 2018 as a special-use domain name for non-unique DNS services in residential networking, to avoid the use of the top-level domain &quot;home.&quot;, which would require DNSSEC signatures. In addition, the use of &quot;home.&quot; led to domain name leakage to the Internet root name servers. The authoritative name servers for home.arpa intercept locally unresolved queries for the domain and return addresses for certain blackhole servers.

==History==
The ARPANET, named for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), was launched in 1969, and is considered the earliest predecessor of the Internet. The agency&#x27;s name was adopted as the name for the first formal name space of the network after it had transitioned to TCP/IP networking in January 1983. The name was used as a naming suffix for all then-existing ARPANET hosts. Hierarchical domain-style names were intended to support delegation of responsibility and authority for adding future hosts to the network.

With the formal development of such a hierarchical naming system, the domain also became one of the inaugural members of a set of domain names for specific types of network members, namely com for commercial users, org for organizations, edu for educational institutions, gov for government entities, and mil for networks of the United States military.

It was expected that the use of &quot;arpa&quot; would be temporary and that the existing systems would be migrated to other domains. But &quot;arpa&quot; also provided e-mail addresses associated with the Network Information Center, which administered the naming system. After serving the transitional purpose, it proved impractical to remove the domain. The domain &quot;in-addr.arpa&quot; had been installed for reverse DNS lookup of IP addresses.

Originally, the IETF intended that new infrastructure databases would be created in the top-level domain &quot;int&quot;. In May 2000, this policy was reversed and it was decided that the top-level domain &quot;int&quot; should be restricted to use by international organizations. &quot;Arpa&quot; was retained for its long-standing purpose, but its full name was changed to the &quot;Address and Routing Parameter Area&quot;, making the zone name a backronym. Registrations of internet infrastructure services in .int made prior to this policy change, were optionally grandfathered in and not required to move to .arpa.

In March 2010, zone arpa was secured with digital signatures within the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

==Subdomains==
Subdomains of &quot;arpa&quot; are created by resolution in the work groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force via the Request for Comments process, and are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The DNS zone &quot;arpa&quot; has the following subdomains:

<text>HNLMS &quot;Van Speijk&quot; (F828) is the eighth and last ship in the of multi-purpose frigates, used by the Royal Netherlands Navy.

==History==
&quot;Van Speijk&quot; was laid down at Schelde Naval Shipbuilding, Vlissingen on 1 October 1991, launched 26 March 1994, and commissioned 7 September 1995.

Starting in 2010 this ship underwent an upgrade program (called &#x27;IPM&#x27;) and was fitted with new mast section with new sensors like: Seastar (small target radar system) and Gatekeeper, a new combat computer system (Linux based), new computer networks, communication equipment, enlarged helicopter deck to allow the NH90 NFH helicopter to land and many other changes. The biggest visual change is the new, bigger mast custom built by the Navy&#x27;s maintenance establishment the &#x27;Marinebedrijf&#x27;. HNLMS &quot;Van Speijk&quot; was the first of four ships to get this update, from both Belgian and Dutch Navy. A new towed sonar will be fitted next few years in a new large maintenance period, to replace the older TACTAS towed array system .

She is the seventh ship in the Royal Netherlands Navy to be named after Jan van Speijk, who, during the Belgian Revolution, blew up his ship rather than let it fall into Belgian hands. To honor him the Dutch king decided the Royal Netherlands Navy will always have a ship named after him.

==Service history==
On 22 December 2017 HNLMS &quot;Van Speijk&quot;, during its term as stationed ship in the Caribbean part of the Netherlands, intercepted drug smugglers trying to smuggle of cocaine. On New Year&#x27;s Eve (2017–2018) &quot; Van Speijk&quot; intercepted of cocaine during an operation in the Caribbean region.

HNLMS Van Speijk was laid up from summer 2021 due to staff shortage. Since that time the ship has been mothballed and anchored at the Nieuwe Haven Naval Base. At the end of 2024 it was decided to reactivate &quot;Van Speijk&quot; and put her back into service in 2026. Before entering service the ship will undergo maintenance and several modifications to make her ready to once again perform as multi-purpose frigate that is specialized in anti-submarine warfare.

<doc id="1004397" wikidata="Q3242403" url="?curid=1004397" title="Conical measure">
<text>A conical measure is a type of laboratory glassware which consists of a conical cup with a notch on the top to allow for the easy pouring of liquids, and graduated markings on the side to allow easy and accurate measurement of volumes of liquid.

They may be made of plastic, glass, or borosilicate glass. The use of the conical measure usually dictates its construction material. Plastic conical measures, commonly referred to as measuring cups are used by patients to measure liquid medicaments for oral administration. Glass and borosilicate conical measures are commonly used when compounding by the pharmacy profession.

Conical measures are the most commonly used item of glassware used in the preparation of extemporaneous medicaments. They are not as precise as graduated cylinders for measuring liquids, but make up for this in terms of easy pouring and ability to mix solutions within the measure itself.

==History==
During his experiments, Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) invented the conical measure, in order to find the ratio between the weight of a substance in air and the weight of water displaced, and to accurately measure the specific weights of the gemstones and their corresponding metals, which are very close to modern measurements.

<doc id="1004399" wikidata="Q284486" url="?curid=1004399" title="Human decontamination">
<text>Human decontamination is the process of removing hazardous materials from the human body, including chemicals, radioactive substances, and infectious material.

==General principle==

People suspected of being contaminated are usually separated by sex, and led into a decontamination tent, trailer, or pod, where they shed their potentially contaminated clothes in a strip-down room. They then enter a wash-down room where they are showered. Finally, they enter a drying and re-robing room to be issued clean clothing, a jumpsuit, or other attire. Some more structured facilities include six rooms (strip-down, wash-down and examination rooms, for each of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s side as per attached drawing). Some facilities, such as MODEC, and many others, are remotely operable, and function like &quot;human car washes&quot;. Common lathering in soap, removes external dust that may contain radioisotopes. It is advised that when lathering, effort should be made not to spread potential dust that deposited onto exposed, unclothed areas of skin, to areas that were once likely clean.

Mass decontamination is the decontamination of large numbers of people. The ACI World Aviation Security Standing Committee describes a decontamination process thus, specifically referring to plans for Los Angeles authorities:

==Hospital decontamination==
Most hospitals in the United States are prepared to handle a large influx of patients from a terrorist attack. Volunteer hospital decontamination teams are common and trained to set up showers or washing equipment, to wear personal protective equipment, and to ensure the safety of both the victims and the community during the response. From a planning perspective it must be remembered that first responders in Level A or B personal protective equipment (PPE) will have a limited working duration, typically 20 minutes to 2 hours.

Typically these teams use decontamination showers built into the hospital or tents which are set up outside in order to decontaminate individuals. Beyond terrorism incidents, common exposures may be related to factory spills, agricultural incidents, and vehicle accidents. Incidents are common in both urban and rural communities. Hospital decontamination is a component of the Hospital Incident Command System and is required in the standards set forth by the Joint Commission.

==Decontamination exercises==
Decontamination exercises are frequently used to test the preparedness of emergency plans and personnel.
Exercises are of three types:
* Tabletop - An exercise held with responsible personnel in which a facilitator relays information about a scenario to the group. The group then discusses the actions they each would take in the given situation. There is no &quot;live response&quot; or use of assets. The table top is a low impact, low stress method to review emergency plans.
* Functional - A functional exercise involves the agencies involved in an Emergency Operations Center, a scenario is presented and the players go through the actions they would if it were a real incident. The exercise tests the technical resources and plans of the Emergency Operations Center. There is no &quot;live response&quot; outside of the Emergency Operations Center.
* Full Scale - A full-scale exercise is the most involved type of exercise and the most difficult to plan and execute. Full-scale exercises can vary in size from one agency or municipality to multinational exercises such as the US Government-led annual TOPOFF exercise. In a full-scale exercise, a scenario is created and acted out in a real-world manner. Responders are expected to act in accordance with established plans, just as they would in a real incident. At times, certain parts of the exercise have to be simulated due to equipment, financial, or safety reasons, which can make the scenario confusing. Full-scale exercises are often used as an opportunity to test and assess an agency&#x27;s true level of preparedness.

==Unified command==

Collaboration among various levels of authority, and among various countries, is required to address bioterror threats, because contamination knows no boundaries. Disease and contamination do not stop at the border from one country to another. Thus organizations such as NATO, bring together member countries to practice how to contain an outbreak, setup quarantine facilities, and care for displaced persons.

==Collection of personal belongings for evidence==
&quot;Dofficers&quot; (Decontamination officers in the &quot;doffing&quot; or disrobing area) are often police or military personnel, ready to handle potentially unruly persons who refuse to cooperate with first responders.

For example, the U.S. ARMY SOLDIER AND BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL COMMAND suggests that:

:&quot;The entire incident is a crime scene requiring the collection of criminal evidence and suspicious victim belongings. The preservation of a proper chain of custody must be maintained for all evidence. ... patients could be suspects and their belongings may be evidence. ... Direct patients through a detailed decontamination process and deal with potentially unruly patients. ... Enforce order when persons become uncooperative when asked to remove clothing and relinquish personal items.&quot;.

Paul Rega, M.D., FACEP, and Kelly Burkholder-Allen also note, in &quot;The ABCs of Bioterrorism&quot; an additional advantage in decontaminating everyone found at the scene of an incident, because this will help the authorities in searching through everyone&#x27;s clothes to find suspicious items:

:&quot;Removal of clothing in the decon procedure has the additional advantage of detecting weapons or a secondary device on a victim or &quot;pseudo-victim&quot;.

Chris Seiple, in &quot;Another Perspective on the Domestic Role of the Military in Consequence Management&quot; suggests that the evidence gathering process of identifying contaminated people and their belongings should also include the process of video surveillance:

:The identification of contaminated victims and their personal effects... Victims are also videotaped as they proceed through the decontamination line.

:Video Surveillance... Videotaped documentation could later be used in the evidence processes;

Although there are the obvious privacy concerns in surveillance, one can also argue that due to the high risk nature of terrorism, such surveillance is warranted, as it is in other high risk areas like bathing complexes where surveillance is often used because of the risk of drowning. In these cases the importance of safety may often be thought to outweigh privacy concerns.

==Handling uncooperative victims==
One of the elements that separates a drill from a real-life situation is dealing with panicked or uncooperative victims. Security personnel should be assigned to the area for crowd control and to ensure appropriate flow of individuals in and out of the decontamination area.

In a real attack, the perpetrators may be among the victims, or some of the victims may be in possession of contraband, or of evidence that might help law enforcement in solving the crime.

Another consideration is that some of the perpetrator victims might refuse to go through decon because this would result in discovery of the contraband they may be hiding.

For example, a person with explosives strapped to his or her body, under their clothing, would likely not be so willing to take it off. Such a victim might try to escape, and need to be restrained for decontamination.

Separate male and female officers (decontamination officers) deal with potentially unruly patients, by restraining the hands using flex cuffs, and cutting off the shirt, then removing shoes and pants normally. This usually requires a couple of officers.

The Belfast Telegraph describes such a situation:

:&quot;...holds back hundreds of extras playing traumatised bomb victims. Coated in ash and wrapped up in bandages, these people are staggering around, dazed and confused, like so many shell-shocked World War I soldiers. While troops in riot gear charge forward to reinforce the cordon and use their shields and batons to beat back ... desperately appeal for calm. They ask people to file in an orderly fashion towards the decontamination units being rapidly assembled by fire fighters in inflated orange Chemical Biological Radiation Nuclear (CBRN) suits.&quot;

See also Battalion Chief Michael Farri:

:They bring a law enforcement agency group with them and they have no problem if somebody needs to be restrained with handcuffs or flex cuffs or whatever to keep them from going from the hot zone to a cool zone; whereas the fire department, we are not geared to do that... Kwame Holman: Colonel Hammes says his Marines are trained to handle uncooperative people. ... If they&#x27;re really hysterical, there&#x27;s some simple techniques from this program called Marine Martial Arts, that teaches various martial arts skills; there are common techniques that police also use to provide pain compliance-- no permanent damage, just enough to get your attention, and allows us to control you. If you still won&#x27;t, then we can control in flex cuffs, and then we&#x27;ll flex cuff decontaminate you. And if you&#x27;re calm at that point, we turn you loose. If you&#x27;re still not calm, then the police will be asked to give us a hand.

==Internal human contamination==

Radioactive contamination can enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or injection. This will result in a committed dose of radiation.

For this reason, it is important to use personal protective equipment when working with radioactive materials. Radioactive contamination may also be ingested as the result of eating contaminated plants and animals or drinking contaminated water or milk from exposed animals. Following a major contamination incident, all potential pathways of internal exposure should be considered.

Successfully used on Harold McCluskey, chelation therapy and other treatments exist for internal radionuclide contamination.

<doc id="1004401" wikidata="Q1048768" url="?curid=1004401" title="Nambu–Goto action">
<text>The Nambu–Goto action is the simplest invariant action in bosonic string theory, and is also used in other theories that investigate string-like objects (for example, cosmic strings). It is the starting point of the analysis of zero-thickness (infinitely thin) string behaviour, using the principles of Lagrangian mechanics. Just as the action for a free point particle is proportional to its proper time – &quot;i.e.&quot;, the &quot;length&quot; of its world-line – a relativistic string&#x27;s action is proportional to the area of the sheet which the string traces as it travels through spacetime.

It is named after Japanese physicists Yoichiro Nambu and Tetsuo Goto.

== Background ==

=== Relativistic Lagrangian mechanics ===

The basic principle of Lagrangian mechanics, the principle of stationary action, is that an object subjected to outside influences will &quot;choose&quot; a path which makes a certain quantity, the &quot;action&quot;, an extremum. The action is a functional, a mathematical relationship which takes an entire path and produces a single number. The &quot;physical path&quot;, that which the object actually follows, is the path for which the action is &quot;stationary&quot; (or extremal): any small variation of the path from the physical one does not significantly change the action. (Often, this is equivalent to saying the physical path is the one for which the action is a minimum.) Actions are typically written using Lagrangians, formulas which depend upon the object&#x27;s state at a particular point in space and/or time. In non-relativistic mechanics, for example, a point particle&#x27;s Lagrangian is the difference between kinetic and potential energy: formula_1. The action, often written formula_2, is then the integral of this quantity from a starting time to an ending time:
: formula_3
(Typically, when using Lagrangians, we assume we know the particle&#x27;s starting and ending positions, and we concern ourselves with the &quot;path&quot; which the particle travels between those positions.)

This approach to mechanics has the advantage that it is easily extended and generalized. For example, we can write a Lagrangian for a relativistic particle, which will be valid even if the particle is traveling close to the speed of light. To preserve Lorentz invariance, the action should only depend upon quantities that are the same for all (Lorentz) observers, i.e. the action should be a Lorentz scalar. The simplest such quantity is the &quot;proper time&quot;, the time measured by a clock carried by the particle. According to special relativity, all Lorentz observers watching a particle move will compute the same value for the quantity
: formula_4
and formula_5 is then an infinitesimal proper time. For a point particle not subject to external forces (i.e., one undergoing inertial motion), the relativistic action is
: formula_6

=== World-sheets ===

Just as a zero-dimensional point traces out a world-line on a spacetime diagram, a one-dimensional string is represented by a &quot;world-sheet&quot;. All world-sheets are two-dimensional surfaces, hence we need two parameters to specify a point on a world-sheet. String theorists use the symbols formula_7 and formula_8 for these parameters. As it turns out, string theories involve higher-dimensional spaces than the 3D world with which we are familiar; bosonic string theory requires 25 spatial dimensions and one time axis. If formula_9 is the number of spatial dimensions, we can represent a point by the vector
: formula_10

We describe a string using functions which map a position in the parameter space (formula_7, formula_8) to a point in spacetime. For each value of formula_7 and formula_8, these functions specify a unique spacetime vector:
: formula_15

The functions formula_16 determine the shape which the world-sheet takes. Different Lorentz observers will disagree on the coordinates they assign to particular points on the world-sheet, but they must all agree on the total &quot;proper area&quot; which the world-sheet has. The Nambu–Goto action is chosen to be proportional to this total proper area.

Let formula_17 be the metric on the formula_18-dimensional spacetime. Then,
: formula_19
is the induced metric on the world-sheet, where formula_20 and formula_21.

For the area formula_22 of the world-sheet the following holds:
: formula_23
where formula_24 and formula_25

Using the notation that:
: formula_26
and
: formula_27
one can rewrite the metric formula_28:
: formula_29
: formula_30
the Nambu–Goto action is defined as
where formula_31.
The factors before the integral give the action the correct units, energy multiplied by time. formula_32 is the tension in the string, and formula_33 is the speed of light. Typically, string theorists work in &quot;natural units&quot; where formula_33 is set to 1 (along with the reduce Planck constant formula_35 and the Newtonian constant of gravitation formula_36). Also, partly for historical reasons, they use the &quot;slope parameter&quot; formula_37 instead of formula_32. With these changes, the Nambu–Goto action becomes
: formula_39

These two forms are, of course, entirely equivalent: choosing one over the other is a matter of convention and convenience.

Two further equivalent forms (on shell but not off shell) are
: formula_40
and
: formula_41
The conjugate momentum field
: formula_42.
Then,
: formula_43
is a primary constraint. The secondary constraint is formula_44. These constraints generate timelike diffeomorphisms and spacelike diffeomorphisms on the worldsheet. The Hamiltonian formula_45. The extended Hamiltonian is given by
: formula_46
where formula_47 and formula_48 are Lagrange multipliers.

The equations of motion satisfy the Virasoro constraints formula_49 and formula_50.

Typically, the Nambu–Goto action does not yet have the form appropriate for studying the quantum physics of strings. For this it must be modified in a similar way as the action of a point particle. That is classically equal to minus mass times the invariant length in spacetime, but must be replaced by a quadratic expression with the same classical value.
For strings the analog correction is provided by the Polyakov action, which is classically equivalent to the Nambu–Goto action, but gives the &#x27;correct&#x27; quantum theory. It is, however, possible to develop a quantum theory from the Nambu–Goto action in the light cone gauge.

<doc id="1004406" wikidata="Q2002502" url="?curid=1004406" title="Royal Scottish National Orchestra">
<text>The Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) () is a Scottish orchestra, based in Glasgow. It is one of the five national performing arts companies of Scotland. Throughout its history, the Orchestra has played an important part in Scotland’s musical life, including performing at the opening ceremony of the Scottish Parliament building in 2004.

Its music centre and rehearsal studios are directly connected to the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. The RSNO performs throughout Scotland, at such venues as Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Usher Hall, Caird Hall, Aberdeen Music Hall, Perth Concert Hall and Eden Court Theatre. Thomas Søndergård is the orchestra&#x27;s current music director, since 2018.

==History==
The precursor ensemble to the RSNO was established in 1843 to accompany the Glasgow Choral Union (today known as the RSNO Chorus). In 1891, the orchestra was recognised formally as the &#x27;Scottish Orchestra&#x27;, with George Henschel as the ensemble&#x27;s first principal conductor under that name. In 1950, the orchestra took the name of the &#x27;Scottish National Orchestra&#x27;. The orchestra received royal patronage in 1977, one of only three British orchestras to do so, after the Royal Philharmonic and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. The orchestra continued to use the name &#x27;Scottish National Orchestra&#x27; until 1991, when it changed to its present name (although during 1992, it briefly changed to the title &#x27;Royal Scottish Orchestra&#x27; before taking its current name).

The orchestra&#x27;s longest-serving principal conductor was Sir Alexander Gibson, the first Scot to be its principal conductor and musical director, from 1959 to 1984. Gibson pioneered overseas tours by the Orchestra, the SNO Junior Chorus and by Scottish Opera. He also became honorary president of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. During Gibson&#x27;s tenure, beginning in 1979, the RSNO&#x27;s base was at Henry Wood Hall in Glasgow and this space was also used as its recording venue. Previously, also during Gibson&#x27;s tenure, the RNSO was based at St Andrew&#x27;s Hall, also in Glasgow; this building was destroyed in a fire on 26 October 1962. Gibson was particularly noted for his interpretations of Scandinavian composers, notably Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen. His successor, Neeme Järvi, continued this tradition, and also led the orchestra through its first complete Gustav Mahler cycle. Principal conductor from 1984 to 1988, Järvi currently has the title of conductor laureate with the RSNO. Bryden Thomson, the orchestra&#x27;s second Scottish principal conductor, maintained the Nordic link with a cycle of Nielsen symphonies.

Alexander Lazarev was principal conductor of the RSNO from 1997 to 2005, and now has the title of conductor emeritus with the RSNO. Marin Alsop was the RSNO&#x27;s principal guest conductor from 2000 to 2003, the first woman to hold the title. Garry Walker succeeded Alsop as principal guest conductor, serving from 2003 to 2007. Stéphane Denève was music director of the RSNO from 2005 to 2012. During his tenure, the RSNO recorded music of Debussy and of Albert Roussel, the latter for Naxos Records.

In January 2011, the RSNO announced the appointment of Peter Oundjian as its next music director, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years. In October 2011, Thomas Søndergård was named the orchestra&#x27;s principal guest conductor, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 3 years for 3 programmes per year. In 2015, the orchestra took up new residence at the RSNO Centre and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. Oundjian concluded his tenure as RSNO music director after the close of the 2017–2018 season.

In May 2017, the RSNO announced the appointment of Søndergård as its next music director, effective with the 2018–2019 season. In February 2021, the RSNO announced the extension of Søndergård&#x27;s contract as music director through autumn 2024. In April 2023, the RSNO announced a one-year extension of Søndergård&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2024–2025 season.

In June 2017, the RSNO appointed Elim Chan as its principal guest conductor, effective 2018, following her first guest-conducting appearance with the RSNO in January 2017 and a return engagement a fortnight later as an emergency substitute for Neeme Järvi. In 2022, Patrick Hahn first guest-conducted the RSNO as an emergency substitute conductor. Chan concluded her tenure as principal guest conductor of the RSNO in March 2023. In March 2024, the RSNO announced the appointment of Hahn as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2024–2025 season.

In December 2018, the RSNO announced the appointment of Alistair Mackie as its next chief executive, effective April 2019.

==RSNO Chorus and RSNO Junior Chorus==
The affiliated choruses of the RSNO are the RSNO Chorus and the RSNO Junior Chorus. The RSNO Chorus evolved from a choir formed in 1843 to sing the first full performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in Scotland, in April 1844. In addition to its commitment to the RSNO, the Chorus performs independently and has toured worldwide. The current chorus director is Gregory Batsleer.

In 1978, Jean Kidd formed the RSNO Junior Chorus. In 1994 its director became Christopher Bell and then in 2018 it changed to Patrick Barrett. The RSNO Junior Chorus has a membership of around 400 singers, aged from eight to eighteen. The members learn to sing using the Kodály method.

==Recordings==

The orchestra has had a long-standing recording contract with Chandos Records, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. The RSNO has also recorded for Naxos Records, most notably in a cycle of Anton Bruckner symphonies with Georg Tintner, cycles of Arnold Bax symphonies with David Lloyd-Jones, and several recordings of American works (including the complete orchestral works of Samuel Barber) conducted by Marin Alsop. With Denève, their first Roussel recording received the Diapason d&#x27;Or de l&#x27;année for Symphonic Music. The second disc in the series was released in 2008.

<text>Bohemians Praha 1905, commonly known as Bohemka or Bohemians Prague, is a professional football club based in Vršovice, Prague, Czech Republic. The club competes in the Fortuna Liga, the top division in the Czech Republic football league system. Founded in 1905 as AFK Vršovice, the club won the 1982–83 Czechoslovak First League, its only league championship. Its colours are green and white.

The best-known player from Bohemians&#x27; history is Antonín Panenka, who is now the club chairman. Bohemians&#x27; mascot is a kangaroo, the legacy of a 1927 tour of Australia. Following the tour, the club was awarded two live kangaroos, which they donated to the Prague Zoo.

==History==
Founded as AFK Vršovice, the club played at the top level of football in the Czechoslovak First League between 1925 and 1935. They spent seasons in and out of the top division for the next 40 years before remaining in the top flight between 1973 and 1995, the most successful era for the club. In the 1982–83 season the club won the Czechoslovak First League and advanced to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. In the year 2005 it survived a crisis, which was a consequence of bad management. The club was prevented from taking part in the second part of the 2004–05 Czech 2. Liga and its results were expunged. The club was relegated to the 3rd Czech division due to its financial insolvency, but later was saved by its fans who paid off a portion of the club&#x27;s debts.

The club finished third in the 2005–06 Bohemian Football League, missing out on promotion, but advanced to the Second League regardless, as they bought a license to play in the Second League from SC Xaverov. The club was then able to advance back to the top flight in 2007, where they played until relegation in 2012. After only one season in 2. Liga Bohemians returned to the First League in 2013.

===Australia Tour===
In 1927 Australian football officials were looking for a European football club to come and tour. They decided on Czechoslovakia and approached Slavia Prague and Viktoria Žižkov who both declined. AFK Vršovice took up the offer.

Before leaving the team looked for a suitable name as they felt the Australians would not know where Vršovice was, let alone be able to pronounce it. They decided on Bohemians (i.e. the Czechs), referring to the country/nation they were from.

===Naming dispute with FK Bohemians===

In 1993, Bohemians 1905 broke away from the TJ Bohemians Praha sports franchise and became a separate legal entity. The club functioned normally until financial troubles came up and the club nearly collapsed in 2005. TJ Bohemians took advantage of the situation and rented out the Bohemians logo to FC Střížkov Praha 9, a lowly team in the third tier of Czech football. TJ were able to pour money into the small club and help them rise to the first division. However, fans remained loyal to the Bohemians 1905 team, and helped the large club to recover.

In September 2012, a Czech court ruled that the former Střížkov club must not continue to use the name &quot;Bohemians&quot; after 31 January 2013. However, in December 2012, the club was granted the right to appeal against the decision, thus protracting the process yet further.

In 2016, Střížkov&#x27;s men&#x27;s team was dissolved, and in 2017 the whole club dissolved, with the women&#x27;s team becoming FC Praha.

==Stadium==

The home stadium, located in Vršovice, is called Ďolíček. However, from the 2010–11 season, for a period of five years, Bohemians undertook to play its home matches at Synot Tip Arena. This arrangement was discontinued in 2012 after the club was relegated from the Czech First League, due to the regulations on stadiums being different between the two leagues.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Bohemians are one of the most popular clubs in the Czech Republic. The club is one of the few in the country to have fans with a left-wing ideology, although most fan groups identify themselves as apolitical, and there are supporters who are right-wing. The ultras group is one of the strongest in terms of choreographies and visual displays in the country. They maintain friendly contacts with Dubliners Bohemian FC. Left-wing fans have friendship with FC St. Pauli and AS Trenčín. Right-wing fans have friendship with Górnik Wałbrzych, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and hooligans with FK Pardubice.

There have been several conflicts in the past between left-wing and right-wing fans. The most famous are the fights in 2013 in the match against FC MAS Táborsko and in 2015 in the match against SK Sigma Olomouc.

The most prestigious match is the derby with Slavia Prague. The &quot;Vršovice Derby&quot; is the second most prestigious derby in Prague (after the Slavia-Sparta derby). Slavia and Bohemians are located in the Vršovice district of Prague and their stadiums are separated by only 1 km. Sparta Prague are considered their biggest rivals, and Viktoria Zizkov is the other team with whom they contest the city derbies. FK Bohemians Prague (Střížkov) were considered to be impostors and the entire club as a fraud, however that rivalry manifested itself on the pitch and towards the club management as the Střížkov club had very little support and no organised fan movement.
