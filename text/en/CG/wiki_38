<text>Epidural administration (from Ancient Greek ἐπί, &quot;upon&quot; + &quot;dura mater&quot;) is a method of medication administration in which a medicine is injected into the epidural space around the spinal cord. The epidural route is used by physicians and nurse anesthetists to administer local anesthetic agents, analgesics, diagnostic medicines such as radiocontrast agents, and other medicines such as glucocorticoids. Epidural administration involves the placement of a catheter into the epidural space, which may remain in place for the duration of the treatment. The technique of intentional epidural administration of medication was first described in 1921 by Catalan military surgeon Fidel Pagés.

Epidural anaesthesia causes a loss of sensation, including pain, by blocking the transmission of signals through nerve fibres in or near the spinal cord. For this reason, epidurals are commonly used for pain control during childbirth and surgery, for which the technique is considered safe and effective, and is considered more effective and safer than giving pain medication by mouth or through an intravenous line. An epidural injection may also be used to administer steroids for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the spinal cord. It is not recommended for people with severe bleeding disorders, low platelet counts, or infections near the intended injection site. Severe complications from epidural administration are rare, but can include problems resulting from improper administration, as well as adverse effects from medicine. The most common complications of epidural injections include bleeding problems, headaches, and inadequate pain control. Epidural analgesia during childbirth may also impact the mother&#x27;s ability to move during labor. Very large doses of anesthetics or analgesics may result in respiratory depression.

An epidural injection may be administered at any point of the spine, but most commonly the lumbar spine, below the end of the spinal cord. The specific administration site determines the specific nerves affected, and thus the area of the body from which pain will be blocked. Insertion of an epidural catheter consists of threading a needle between bones and ligaments to reach the epidural space without going so far as to puncture the &quot;dura mater&quot;. Saline or air may be used to confirm placement in the epidural space. Alternatively, direct imaging of the injection area may be performed with a portable ultrasound or fluoroscopy to confirm correct placement. Once placed, medication may be administered in one or more single doses, or may be continually infused over a period of time. When placed properly, an epidural catheter may remain inserted for several days, but is usually removed when it is possible to use less invasive administration methods (such as oral medication).

== Uses ==
=== Pain relief during childbirth ===
Epidural injections are commonly used to provide pain relief (analgesia) during childbirth. This usually involves epidural injection of a local anesthetic and opioids, commonly called an &quot;epidural&quot;. This is more effective than oral or intravenous (IV) opioids and other common modalities of analgesia in childbirth. After an epidural is administered, the recipient may not feel pain, but may still feel pressure. Epidural clonidine is rarely used but has been extensively studied for management of analgesia during labor.

Epidural analgesia is considered a safer and more effective method of relieving pain in labor as compared to intravenous or oral analgesia. In a 2018 Cochrane review of studies which compared epidural analgesia with oral opioids, some advantages of epidural analgesia versus opioids included fewer instances of naloxone use in newborns, and decreased risk of maternal hyperventilation. Some disadvantages of epidural analgesia versus opioids included longer labor durations, an increased need for oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions, and an increased risk of fever, low blood pressure, and muscle weakness. 

However, the review found no difference in overall Caesarean delivery rates between epidural analgesia versus no analgesia. Additionally, there was no difference found on the immediate neonatal health of the child between epidural analgesia versus no analgesia. Furthermore, the occurrence of long-term backache was unchanged after epidural use. Complications of epidural analgesia are rare, but may include headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing and seizures for the mother. The child may experience a slow heartbeat, decreased ability to regulate temperature, and potential exposure to the drugs administered to the mother.

There is no overall difference in outcomes based on the time the epidural is administered to the mother, specifically no change in the rate of caesarean section, birth which must be assisted by instruments, and duration of labor. There is also no change in the Apgar score of the newborn between early and late epidural administration. Epidurals other than low-dose ambulatory epidurals also impact the ability of the mother to move during labor. Movement such as walking or changing positions may help improve labor comfort and decrease the risk of complications.

=== Pain relief during other surgery ===
Epidural analgesia has been demonstrated to have several benefits after other surgeries, including decreasing the need for the use of oral or systemic opioids, and reducing the risk of postoperative respiratory problems, chest infections, blood transfusion requirements, and myocardial infarctions. Use of epidural analgesia after surgery in place of systemic analgesia is less likely to decrease intestinal motility which would occur with systemic opioid therapy through blockade of the sympathetic nervous system. Some surgeries that spinal analgesia may be used in include lower abdominal surgery, lower limb surgery, cardiac surgery, and perineal surgery.
=== Others ===
The injection of steroids into the epidural space is sometimes used to treat nerve root pain, radicular pain and inflammation caused by conditions such as spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis. The risk of complications from steroid administration is low and complications are usually minor. The specific drug, dose, and frequency of administration impacts the risk for and severity of complications. Complications of epidural steroid administration are similar to the side effects of steroids administered in other manners, and can include higher than normal blood sugar, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.
An epidural blood patch consists of a small amount of a person&#x27;s own blood is injected into the epidural space. This is done as a method of sealing a hole or leak in the epidural. The injected blood clots at the site of the puncture, closes the leak, and modulates CSF pressure. This may be used to treat post-dural-puncture headache and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid due to dural puncture, which occurs in approximately 1.5% of epidural analgesia procedures.

== Contraindications ==
The use of epidural analgesia and anesthetic is considered safe and effective in most situations. Epidural analgesia is contraindicated in people who have complications such as cellulitis near the injection site or severe coagulopathy. In some cases, it may be contraindicated in people with low platelets, increased intracranial pressure, or decreased cardiac output. Due to the risk of disease progression, it is also potentially contraindicated in people with preexisting progressive neurologic disease. Some heart conditions such as stenosis of the aortic or mitral valves are also a contraindication to the use of epidural administration, as is low blood pressure or hypovolemia. An epidural is generally not used in people who are being administered anticoagulation therapy as it increases the risk of complications from the epidural.

== Risks and complications ==
In addition to blocking nerves which carry pain signals, local anesthetics may block nerves which carry other signals, though sensory nerve fibers are more sensitive to the effects of the local anesthetics than motor nerve fibers. For this reason, adequate pain control can usually be attained without blocking the motor neurons, which would cause a loss of muscle control if it occurred. Depending on the drug and dose administered, the effects may last only a few minutes or up to several hours. As such, an epidural can provide pain control without as much of an effect on muscle strength. For example, a woman in labor who is being administered continuous analgesia via an epidural may not have impairment to her ability to move. Larger doses of medication are more likely to result in side effects. Very large doses of some medications can cause paralysis of the intercostal muscles and thoracic diaphragm responsible for breathing, which may lead to respiratory depression or arrest. It may also result in loss of sympathetic nerve input to the heart, which may cause a significant decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Obese people, those who have given birth prior, those with a history of opiate use, or those with cervical dilation of more than 7 cm are at a higher risk of inadequate pain control.

If the dura is accidentally punctured during administration, it may cause cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the epidural space, causing a post-dural-puncture headache. This occurs in approximately 1 in 100 epidural procedures. Such a headache may be severe and last several days, or rarely weeks to months, and is caused by a reduction in CSF pressure. Mild post-dural-puncture headaches may be treated with caffeine and gabapentin, while severe headaches may be treated with an epidural blood patch, though most cases resolve spontaneously with time. Less common but more severe complications include subdural hematoma and cerebral venous thrombosis. The epidural catheter may also rarely be inadvertently placed in the subarachnoid space, which occurs in less than 1 in 1000 procedures. If this occurs, cerebrospinal fluid can be freely aspirated from the catheter, and this is used to detect misplacement. When this occurs, the catheter is withdrawn and replaced elsewhere, though occasionally no fluid may be aspirated despite a dural puncture. If dural puncture is not recognized, large doses of anesthetic may be delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. This may result in a high block, or, more rarely, a &quot;total spinal&quot;, where anesthetic is delivered directly to the brainstem, causing unconsciousness and sometimes seizures.

Epidural administrations can also cause bleeding issues, including &quot;bloody tap&quot;, which occurs in approximately 1 in 30–50 people. This occurs when epidural veins are inadvertently punctured with the needle during the insertion. It is a common occurrence and is not usually considered a problem in people who have normal blood clotting. Permanent neurological problems from bloody tap are extremely rare, estimated at less than 0.07% of occurrences. However, people who have a coagulopathy may have a risk of epidural hematoma, and those with thrombocytopenia might bleed more than expected. A 2018 Cochrane review found no evidence regarding the effect of platelet transfusions prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anesthesia for participants that have thrombocytopenia. It is unclear whether major surgery-related bleeding within 24 hours and the surgery-related complications up to 7 days after the procedure are affected by epidural use.

Rare complications of epidural administration include formation of an epidural abscess (1 in 145,000) or epidural hematoma (1 in 168,000), neurological injury lasting longer than 1 year (1 in 240,000), paraplegia (1 in 250,000), and arachnoiditis. Rarely, an epidural may cause death (1 in 100,000). In circumstances where contraindications exist, there are numerous fascial plane blocks that may be provided instead of an epidural.

===Medication-specific===
If bupivacaine, a medication commonly administered via epidural, is inadvertently administered into a vein, it can cause excitation, nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, or seizures as well as central nervous system depression, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. Bupivacaine intended for epidural administration has been implicated in cardiac arrests resulting in death when accidentally administered into a vein instead of the epidural space. The administration of large doses of opioids into the epidural space may cause itching and respiratory depression. The sensation of needing to urinate is often significantly diminished or completely absent after administration of epidural local anesthetics or opioids. Because of this, a urinary catheter is often placed for the duration of the epidural infusion.

In many women given epidural analgesia during labor oxytocin is also used to augment uterine contractions. In one study which examined the rate of breastfeeding two days following epidural anesthesia during childbirth, epidural analgesia used in combination with oxytocin resulted in lower maternal oxytocin and prolactin levels in response to breastfeeding on the second day following birth. The lower maternal oxytocin level negatively affects the baby’s feeding rooting reflex, decreasing the amount of milk produced. The consequence of these effects from epidural analgesia is higher weight loss.

== Technique ==
=== Anatomy ===
An epidural is injected into the epidural space, inside the bony spinal canal but just outside the dura. In contact with the inner surface of the dura is another membrane called the arachnoid mater, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In adults, the spinal cord terminates around the level of the disc between L1 and L2, while in neonates it extends to L3 but can reach as low as L4. Below the spinal cord there is a bundle of nerves known as the cauda equina or &quot;horse&#x27;s tail&quot;. Hence, lumbar epidural injections carry a low risk of injuring the spinal cord. Insertion of an epidural needle involves threading a needle between the bones, through the ligaments and into the epidural space without puncturing the layer immediately below containing CSF under pressure.

=== Insertion ===

Epidural administration is a procedure which requires the person performing the insertion to be technically proficient in order to avoid complications. Proficiency may be trained using bananas or other fruits as a model.

The person receiving the epidural may be seated, or lying on their side or stomach. The level of the spine at which the catheter is placed depends mainly on the site of intended operation – based on the location of the pain. The iliac crest is a commonly used anatomical landmark for lumbar epidural injections, as this level roughly corresponds with the fourth lumbar vertebra, which is usually well below the termination of the spinal cord. The Tuohy needle, designed with a 90-degree curved tip and side hole to redirect the inserted catheter vertically along the axis of the spine, may be inserted in the midline, between the spinous processes. When using a paramedian approach, the tip of the needle passes along a shelf of vertebral bone called the lamina until just before reaching the ligamentum flavum and the epidural space.

Along with a sudden loss of resistance to pressure on the plunger of the syringe, a slight clicking sensation may be felt by the operator as the tip of the needle breaches the ligamentum flavum and enters the epidural space. Saline or air may be used to identify placement in the epidural space. A systematic review from 2014 showed no difference in terms of safety or efficacy between the use of saline and air for this purpose. In addition to the loss of resistance technique, direct imaging of the placement may be used. This may be conducted with a portable ultrasound scanner or fluoroscopy (moving X-ray pictures). After placement of the tip of the needle, a catheter or small tube is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is then withdrawn over the catheter. The catheter is generally inserted 4–6 cm into the epidural space, and is typically secured to the skin with adhesive tape, similar to an intravenous line.

=== Use and removal ===
If a short duration of action is desired, a single dose of medication called a bolus may be administered. Thereafter, this bolus may be repeated if necessary provided the catheter remains undisturbed. For a prolonged effect, a continuous infusion of medication may be used. There is some evidence that an automated intermittent bolus technique may provide better pain control than a continuous infusion technique even when the total doses administered are identical. Typically, the effects of the epidural block are noted below a specific level or portion of the body, determined by the site of injection. A higher injection may result in sparing of nerve function in the lower spinal nerves. For example, a thoracic epidural performed for upper abdominal surgery may not have any effect on the area surrounding the genitals or pelvic organs.

=== Combined spinal-epidural techniques ===
For some procedures where both the rapid onset of a spinal anesthetic and the post-operative analgesic effects of an epidural are desired, both techniques may be used in combination. This is called combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (CSE). The spinal anesthetic may be administered in one location, and the epidural at an adjacent location. Alternatively, after locating the epidural space with the Tuohy needle, a spinal needle may be inserted through the Tuohy needle into the subarachnoid space. The spinal dose is then given, the spinal needle withdrawn, and the epidural catheter inserted as normal. This method, known as the &quot;needle-through-needle&quot; technique, may be associated with a slightly higher risk of placing the catheter into the subarachnoid space.

== Recovery ==
Epidural analgesia is generally well tolerated, with recovery time quick after administration is complete and the epidural is removed. The epidural catheter is usually removed when it is possible to safely switch to oral administration of medications, though catheters can safely remain in place for several days with little risk of bacterial infection, particularly if the skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine solution. Subcutaneously tunneled epidural catheters may be safely left in place for longer periods, with a low risk of infection or other complications. Regardless of the length of use, the effects of a medicine administered epidurally, including numbness if used for analgesia, usually wear off within a few hours of the epidural being stopped, with full recovery of normal function within 24 hours.

The use of epidural analgesia during a birth does not have any effect on whether a caesarean section must be performed during future births. Epidural analgesia during childbirth also generally has no negative effects on the long-term health of the mother or child. Use of epidural analgesia versus oral analgesia or no analgesia has no effect on the normal length of hospital stay after childbirth, the only difference being that care must be performed around the epidural insertion site to prevent infection. Following epidural analgesia used for gastrointestinal surgery, the time to recovery of normal gastrointestinal function is not significantly different from recovery time after intravenous analgesia. The use of epidural analgesia during cardiac surgeries may shorten the amount of time a person requires ventilator support following surgery, but it is unknown whether it shortens the overall post-surgery hospital stay overall.

== History ==

The first record of an epidural injection is from 1885, when American neurologist James Corning of Acorn Hall in Morristown, New Jersey, used the technique to perform a neuraxial blockade. Corning inadvertently injected 111 mg of cocaine into the epidural space of a healthy male volunteer, although at the time he believed he was injecting it into the subarachnoid space. Following this, in 1901 Fernand Cathelin first reported intentionally blocking the lowest sacral and coccygeal nerves through the epidural space by injecting local anesthetic through the sacral hiatus. The loss of resistance technique was first described by Achile Dogliotti in 1933, following which Alberto Gutiérrez described the hanging drop technique. Both techniques are now used to identify when the needle has correctly been placed in the epidural space.

In 1921 Fidel Pagés, a military surgeon from Spain, developed the technique of &quot;single-shot&quot; lumbar epidural anesthesia, which was later popularized by Italian surgeon Achille Mario Dogliotti. Later, in 1931 Eugen Aburel described using a continuous epidural catheter for pain relief during childbirth. In 1941, Robert Hingson and Waldo Edwards recorded the use of continuous caudal anesthesia using an indwelling needle, following which they described the use of a flexible catheter for continuous caudal anesthesia in a woman in labor in 1942. In 1947, Manuel Curbelo described placement of a lumbar epidural catheter, and in 1979, Behar reported the first use of an epidural to administer narcotics.

==Society and culture==
Some people continue to be concerned that women who are administered epidural analgesia during labor are more likely to require a cesarean delivery, based on older observational studies. However, evidence has shown that the use of epidural analgesia during labor does not have any statistically significant effect on the necessity to perform a cesarean delivery. A 2018 Cochrane review found no increase in the rate of Caesarean delivery when epidural analgesia was employed. However, epidural analgesia does lengthen the second stage of labor by 15 to 30 minutes, which may increase the risk a delivery must be assisted by instruments.

In the United States in 1998, it was reported that over half of childbirths involved the use of epidural analgesia, and by 2008 this had increased to 61% of births. In the United Kingdom, epidurals have been offered through the National Health Service for all women during childbirth since 1980. By 1998, epidural analgesia was used in the UK for almost 25% of childbirths. In Japan, most childbirths take place in primary or secondary hospitals in which epidural analgesia is not offered.

In some developed countries, over 70% of childbirths involve epidural analgesia. Other studies have shown that minority women and immigrants are less likely to receive epidural analgesia during childbirth. Even in countries with universal healthcare coverage such as Canada, socioeconomic factors such as race, financial stability, and education influence the rate at which women receive epidural analgesia. One survey in 2014 found that over half of pregnant women in a Nigerian antenatal clinic (79.5%) did not know what epidural analgesia was or what it was used for, while 76.5% of them would utilize epidural analgesia if offered after it was explained to them.

<text>The Enlisted Person of the Year Ribbon is a decoration of the United States Coast Guard which was established in 1999, though retroactive to 1994, by order of the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

The Enlisted Person of the Year Ribbon is annually awarded to two members of the Coast Guard, paygrade E-2 through E-6; the Coast Guard Enlisted Person of the Year (EPOY) and the Coast Guard Reserve Enlisted Person of the Year (REPOY).

The selection based on a display of pride, professionalism, and dedication to Coast Guard core values, and is made by a panel of Master Chief Petty Officers, led by the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard (MCPOCG). The decoration is a one time only award and there are no devices authorized for multiple presentations.

The Coast Guard Reserve Enlisted Person of the Year was previously called the &quot;NERA Outstanding Enlisted CG Reservist Award&quot;.

This award was based on the Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon, which is awarded by the United States Air Force. The United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps have no award equivalent to the Enlisted Person of the Year Ribbon, although do maintain similar programs for yearly recognition of outstanding enlisted personnel.

<text>An analog telephone adapter (ATA) or FXS gateway is a device for connecting traditional analog telephones, fax machines, and similar customer-premises devices to a digital telephone system or a voice over IP telephone network.

An ATA is often built into a small enclosure with an internal or external power adapter, an Ethernet port, and one or more foreign exchange station (FXS) telephone ports. Such devices may also have a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface for providing alternative access to traditional landline telephone service.

The ATA provides dial tone, ringing generator, DC power, caller ID data and other standard telephone line signaling (known collectively as BORSCHT) to the telephone connected to a modular jack.

The digital interface of the ATA typically consists of an Ethernet port to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) network, but may also be a USB port for connecting the device to a personal computer.

Using such an ATA, it is possible to connect a conventional telephone to a remote VoIP server. The ATA communicates with the server using a protocol such as H.323, SIP, MGCP, SCCP or IAX, and encodes and decodes the voice signal using a voice codec such as G.711, G.729, GSM, or iLBC. Since the ATA communicates directly with the VoIP server, it does not require a personal computer or any software such as a softphone. It uses approximately 3 to 5 watts of electricity, depending on the model and brand.

Often an ATA is connected between an IP network (such as a broadband connection) and the existing telephone wiring of the residence through one of the jacks to provide public switched telephone network (PSTN) access.

<text>In mathematics, the derived category &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) of an abelian category &quot;A&quot; is a construction of homological algebra introduced to refine and in a certain sense to simplify the theory of derived functors defined on &quot;A&quot;. The construction proceeds on the basis that the objects of &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) should be chain complexes in &quot;A&quot;, with two such chain complexes considered isomorphic when there is a chain map that induces an isomorphism on the level of homology of the chain complexes. Derived functors can then be defined for chain complexes, refining the concept of hypercohomology. The definitions lead to a significant simplification of formulas otherwise described (not completely faithfully) by complicated spectral sequences.

The development of the derived category, by Alexander Grothendieck and his student Jean-Louis Verdier shortly after 1960, now appears as one terminal point in the explosive development of homological algebra in the 1950s, a decade in which it had made remarkable strides. The basic theory of Verdier was written down in his dissertation, published finally in 1996 in Astérisque (a summary had earlier appeared in SGA 4½). The axiomatics required an innovation, the concept of triangulated category, and the construction is based on localization of a category, a generalization of localization of a ring. The original impulse to develop the &quot;derived&quot; formalism came from the need to find a suitable formulation of Grothendieck&#x27;s coherent duality theory. Derived categories have since become indispensable also outside of algebraic geometry, for example in the formulation of the theory of D-modules and microlocal analysis. Recently derived categories have also become important in areas nearer to physics, such as D-branes and mirror symmetry.

Unbounded derived categories were introduced by Spaltenstein in 1988.

==Motivations==

In coherent sheaf theory, pushing to the limit of what could be done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single &quot;dualizing sheaf&quot; became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the &#x27;real&#x27; tensor product and &quot;Hom&quot; functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.

Despite the level of abstraction, derived categories became accepted over the following decades, especially as a convenient setting for sheaf cohomology. Perhaps the biggest advance was the formulation of the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence in dimensions greater than 1 in derived terms, around 1980. The Sato school adopted the language of derived categories, and the subsequent history of D-modules was of a theory expressed in those terms.

A parallel development was the category of spectra in homotopy theory. The homotopy category of spectra and the derived category of a ring are both examples of triangulated categories.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be an abelian category. (Examples include the category of modules over a ring and the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space.) The derived category formula_2 is defined by a universal property with respect to the category formula_3 of cochain complexes with terms in formula_1. The objects of formula_3 are of the form
:formula_6
where each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is an object of formula_1 and each of the composites formula_8 is zero. The &quot;i&quot;th cohomology group of the complex is formula_9. If formula_10 and formula_11 are two objects in this category, then a morphism formula_12 is defined to be a family of morphisms formula_13 such that formula_14. Such a morphism induces morphisms on cohomology groups formula_15, and formula_16 is called a quasi-isomorphism if each of these morphisms is an isomorphism in formula_1.

The universal property of the derived category is that it is a localization of the category of complexes with respect to quasi-isomorphisms. Specifically, the derived category formula_2 is a category, together with a functor formula_19, having the following universal property: Suppose formula_20 is another category (not necessarily abelian) and formula_21 is a functor such that, whenever formula_16 is a quasi-isomorphism in formula_3, its image formula_24 is an isomorphism in formula_20; then formula_26 factors through formula_27. Any two categories having this universal property are equivalent.

=== Relation to the homotopy category ===
If formula_28 and formula_29 are two morphisms formula_30 in formula_3, then a chain homotopy or simply homotopy formula_32 is a collection of morphisms formula_33 such that formula_34 for every &quot;i&quot;. It is straightforward to show that two homotopic morphisms induce identical morphisms on cohomology groups. We say that formula_35 is a chain homotopy equivalence if there exists formula_36 such that formula_37 and formula_38 are chain homotopic to the identity morphisms on formula_39 and formula_40, respectively. The homotopy category of cochain complexes formula_41 is the category with the same objects as formula_3 but whose morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms of complexes with respect to the relation of chain homotopy. There is a natural functor formula_43 which is the identity on objects and which sends each morphism to its chain homotopy equivalence class. Since every chain homotopy equivalence is a quasi-isomorphism, formula_27 factors through this functor. Consequently formula_2 can be equally well viewed as a localization of the homotopy category.

From the point of view of model categories, the derived category &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the true &#x27;homotopy category&#x27; of the category of complexes, whereas &quot;K&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) might be called the &#x27;naive homotopy category&#x27;.

=== Constructing the derived category ===
There are several possible constructions of the derived category. When formula_1 is a small category, then there is a direct construction of the derived category by formally adjoining inverses of quasi-isomorphisms. This is an instance of the general construction of a category by generators and relations.

When formula_1 is a large category, this construction does not work for set theoretic reasons. This construction builds morphisms as equivalence classes of paths. If formula_1 has a proper class of objects, all of which are isomorphic, then there is a proper class of paths between any two of these objects. The generators and relations construction therefore only guarantees that the morphisms between two objects form a proper class. However, the morphisms between two objects in a category are usually required to be sets, and so this construction fails to produce an actual category.

Even when formula_1 is small, however, the construction by generators and relations generally results in a category whose structure is opaque, where morphisms are arbitrarily long paths subject to a mysterious equivalence relation. For this reason, it is conventional to construct the derived category more concretely even when set theory is not at issue.

These other constructions go through the homotopy category. The collection of quasi-isomorphisms in formula_41 forms a multiplicative system. This is a collection of conditions that allow complicated paths to be rewritten as simpler ones. The Gabriel–Zisman theorem implies that localization at a multiplicative system has a simple description in terms of roofs. A morphism formula_30 in formula_2 may be described as a pair formula_53, where for some complex formula_54, formula_55 is a quasi-isomorphism and formula_56 is a chain homotopy equivalence class of morphisms. Conceptually, this represents formula_57. Two roofs are equivalent if they have a common overroof.

Replacing chains of morphisms with roofs also enables the resolution of the set-theoretic issues involved in derived categories of large categories. Fix a complex formula_39 and consider the category formula_59 whose objects are quasi-isomorphisms in formula_41 with codomain formula_39 and whose morphisms are commutative diagrams. Equivalently, this is the category of objects over formula_39 whose structure maps are quasi-isomorphisms. Then the multiplicative system condition implies that the morphisms in formula_2 from formula_39 to formula_40 are
:formula_66
assuming that this colimit is in fact a set. While formula_59 is potentially a large category, in some cases it is controlled by a small category. This is the case, for example, if formula_1 is a Grothendieck abelian category (meaning that it satisfies AB5 and has a set of generators), with the essential point being that only objects of bounded cardinality are relevant. In these cases, the limit may be calculated over a small subcategory, and this ensures that the result is a set. Then formula_2 may be defined to have these sets as its formula_70 sets.

There is a different approach based on replacing morphisms in the derived category by morphisms in the homotopy category. A morphism in the derived category with codomain being a bounded below complex of injective objects is the same as a morphism to this complex in the homotopy category; this follows from termwise injectivity. By replacing termwise injectivity by a stronger condition, one gets a similar property that applies even to unbounded complexes. A complex formula_71 is &quot;K&quot;-injective if, for every acyclic complex formula_39, we have formula_73. A straightforward consequence of this is that, for every complex formula_39, morphisms formula_75 in formula_41 are the same as such morphisms in formula_2. A theorem of Serpé, generalizing work of Grothendieck and of Spaltenstein, asserts that in a Grothendieck abelian category, every complex is quasi-isomorphic to a K-injective complex with injective terms, and moreover, this is functorial. In particular, we may define morphisms in the derived category by passing to K-injective resolutions and computing morphisms in the homotopy category. The functoriality of Serpé&#x27;s construction ensures that composition of morphisms is well-defined. Like the construction using roofs, this construction also ensures suitable set theoretic properties for the derived category, this time because these properties are already satisfied by the homotopy category.

== Derived Hom-sets ==
As noted before, in the derived category the hom sets are expressed through roofs, or valleys formula_78, where formula_79 is a quasi-isomorphism. To get a better picture of what elements look like, consider an exact sequence
:formula_80
We can use this to construct a morphism formula_81 by truncating the complex above, shifting it, and using the obvious morphisms above. In particular, we have the picture
:formula_82
where the bottom complex has formula_83 concentrated in degree formula_84, the only non-trivial upward arrow is the equality morphism, and the only-nontrivial downward arrow is formula_85. This diagram of complexes defines a morphism
:formula_86
in the derived category. One application of this observation is the construction of the Atiyah-class.

== Remarks ==
For certain purposes (see below) one uses &quot;bounded-below&quot; (formula_87 for formula_88), &quot;bounded-above&quot; (formula_87 for formula_90) or &quot;bounded&quot; (formula_87 for formula_92) complexes instead of unbounded ones. The corresponding derived categories are usually denoted &quot;D+(A)&quot;, &quot;D−(A)&quot; and &quot;Db(A)&quot;, respectively.

If one adopts the classical point of view on categories, that there is a set of morphisms from one object to another (not just a class), then one has to give an additional argument to prove this. If, for example, the abelian category &quot;A&quot; is small, i.e. has only a set of objects, then this issue will be no problem. Also, if &quot;A&quot; is a Grothendieck abelian category, then the derived category &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category &quot;K&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), and hence has only a set of morphisms from one object to another. Grothendieck abelian categories include the category of modules over a ring, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and many other examples.

Composition of morphisms, i.e. roofs, in the derived category is accomplished by finding a third roof on top of the two roofs to be composed. It may be checked that this is possible and gives a well-defined, associative composition.

Since &quot;K(A)&quot; is a triangulated category, its localization &quot;D(A)&quot; is also triangulated. For an integer &quot;n&quot; and a complex &quot;X&quot;, define the complex &quot;X&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] to be &quot;X&quot; shifted down by &quot;n&quot;, so that 
:formula_93
with differential
:formula_94
By definition, a distinguished triangle in &quot;D(A)&quot; is a triangle that is isomorphic in &quot;D(A)&quot; to the triangle &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; → Cone(&quot;f&quot;) → &quot;X&quot;[1] for some map of complexes &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;. Here Cone(&quot;f&quot;) denotes the mapping cone of &quot;f&quot;. In particular, for a short exact sequence 
:formula_95
in &quot;A&quot;, the triangle &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot;[1] is distinguished in &quot;D(A)&quot;. Verdier explained that the definition of the shift &quot;X&quot;[1] is forced by requiring &quot;X&quot;[1] to be the cone of the morphism &quot;X&quot; → 0.

By viewing an object of &quot;A&quot; as a complex concentrated in degree zero, the derived category &quot;D(A)&quot; contains &quot;A&quot; as a full subcategory. Morphisms in the derived category include information about all Ext groups: for any objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and any integer &quot;j&quot;,

:formula_96

== Projective and injective resolutions ==
One can easily show that a homotopy equivalence is a quasi-isomorphism, so the second step in the above construction may be omitted. The definition is usually given in this way because it reveals the existence of a canonical functor 
:formula_97

In concrete situations, it is very difficult or impossible to handle morphisms in the derived category directly. Therefore, one looks for a more manageable category which is equivalent to the derived category. Classically, there are two (dual) approaches to this: projective and injective resolutions. In both cases, the restriction of the above canonical functor to an appropriate subcategory will be an equivalence of categories.

In the following we will describe the role of injective resolutions in the context of the derived category, which is the basis for defining right derived functors, which in turn have important applications in cohomology of sheaves on topological spaces or more advanced cohomology theories like étale cohomology or group cohomology.

In order to apply this technique, one has to assume that the abelian category in question has &quot;enough injectives&quot;, which means that every object &quot;X&quot; of the category admits a monomorphism to an injective object &quot;I&quot;. (Neither the map nor the injective object has to be uniquely specified.) For example, every Grothendieck abelian category has enough injectives. Embedding &quot;X&quot; into some injective object &quot;I&quot;0, the cokernel of this map into some injective &quot;I&quot;1 etc., one constructs an &quot;injective resolution&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, i.e. an exact (in general infinite) sequence

:formula_98

where the &quot;I&quot;* are injective objects. This idea generalizes to give resolutions of bounded-below complexes &quot;X&quot;, i.e. &quot;Xn = 0&quot; for sufficiently small &quot;n&quot;. As remarked above, injective resolutions are not uniquely defined, but it is a fact that any two resolutions are homotopy equivalent to each other, i.e. isomorphic in the homotopy category. Moreover, morphisms of complexes extend uniquely to a morphism of two given injective resolutions.

This is the point where the homotopy category comes into play again: mapping an object &quot;X&quot; of &quot;A&quot; to (any) injective resolution &quot;I&quot;* of &quot;A&quot; extends to a functor 
:formula_99
from the bounded below derived category to the bounded below homotopy category of complexes whose terms are injective objects in &quot;A&quot;.

It is not difficult to see that this functor is actually inverse to the restriction of the canonical localization functor mentioned in the beginning. In other words, morphisms Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) in the derived category may be computed by resolving both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and computing the morphisms in the homotopy category, which is at least theoretically easier. In fact, it is enough to resolve &quot;Y&quot;: for any complex &quot;X&quot; and any bounded below complex &quot;Y&quot; of injectives,
:formula_100

Dually, assuming that &quot;A&quot; has &quot;enough projectives&quot;, i.e. for every object &quot;X&quot; there is an epimorphism from a projective object &quot;P&quot; to &quot;X&quot;, one can use projective resolutions instead of injective ones.

In 1988 Spaltenstein defined an unbounded derived category () which immediately proved useful in the study of singular spaces; see, for example, the book by Kashiwara and Schapira (Categories and Sheaves) on various applications of unbounded derived category. Spaltenstein used so-called &quot;K-injective&quot; and &quot;K-projective&quot; resolutions.

 and May (2006) describe the derived category of modules over DG-algebras. Keller also gives applications to Koszul duality, Lie algebra cohomology, and Hochschild homology.

More generally, carefully adapting the definitions, it is possible to define the derived category of an exact category .

== The relation to derived functors ==
The derived category is a natural framework to define and study derived functors. In the following, let &quot;F&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; be a functor of abelian categories. There are two dual concepts:
* right derived functors come from left exact functors and are calculated via injective resolutions
* left derived functors come from right exact functors and are calculated via projective resolutions

In the following we will describe right derived functors. So, assume that &quot;F&quot; is left exact. Typical examples are &quot;F&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → Ab given by &quot;X&quot; ↦ Hom(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) or &quot;X&quot; ↦ Hom(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) for some fixed object &quot;A&quot;, or the global sections functor on sheaves or the direct image functor. Their right derived functors are Ext&quot;n&quot;(–,&quot;A&quot;), Ext&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;,–), &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) or &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;f&quot;∗ (&quot;F&quot;), respectively.

The derived category allows us to encapsulate all derived functors &quot;RnF&quot; in one functor, namely the so-called &quot;total derived functor&quot; &quot;RF&quot;: &quot;D&quot;+(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;D&quot;+(&quot;B&quot;). It is the following composition: &quot;D&quot;+(&quot;A&quot;) ≅ &quot;K&quot;+(Inj(&quot;A&quot;)) → &quot;K&quot;+(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;D&quot;+(&quot;B&quot;), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors are related to the total one via &quot;RnF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;RF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)). One might say that the &quot;RnF&quot; forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas &quot;RF&quot; does keep track of the complexes.

Derived categories are, in a sense, the &quot;right&quot; place to study these functors. For example, the Grothendieck spectral sequence of a composition of two functors

:formula_101

such that &quot;F&quot; maps injective objects in &quot;A&quot; to &quot;G&quot;-acyclics (i.e. &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;I&quot;)) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 and injective &quot;I&quot;), is an expression of the following identity of total derived functors
:&quot;R&quot;(&quot;G&quot;∘&quot;F&quot;) ≅ &quot;RG&quot;∘&quot;RF&quot;.

J.-L. Verdier showed how derived functors associated with an abelian category &quot;A&quot; can be viewed as Kan extensions along embeddings of &quot;A&quot; into suitable derived categories [Mac Lane].

==Derived equivalence==
It may happen that two abelian categories &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are not equivalent, but their derived categories D(&quot;A&quot;) and D(&quot;B&quot;) are. Often this is an interesting relation between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Such equivalences are related to the theory of t-structures in triangulated categories. Here are some examples.

* Let formula_102 be an abelian category of coherent sheaves on the projective line over a field &quot;k&quot;. Let &quot;K&quot;2-Rep be an abelian category of representations of the Kronecker quiver with two vertices. They are very different abelian categories, but their (bounded) derived categories are equivalent. 
* Let &quot;Q&quot; be any quiver and &quot;P&quot; be a quiver obtained from &quot;Q&quot; by reversing some arrows. In general, the categories of representations of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are different, but Db(&quot;Q&quot;-Rep) is always equivalent to Db(&quot;P&quot;-Rep).
* Let &quot;X&quot; be an abelian variety, &quot;Y&quot; its dual abelian variety. Then Db(Coh(&quot;X&quot;)) is equivalent to Db(Coh(&quot;Y&quot;)) by the theory of Fourier–Mukai transforms. Varieties with equivalent derived categories of coherent sheaves are sometimes called Fourier–Mukai partners.

<doc id="985909" wikidata="Q3275782" url="?curid=985909" title="Makunouchi">
<text>is a popular type of Japanese bento which consists of mostly rice along with fish, meat, pickles, eggs, vegetables, and an umeboshi (a salt pickled plum). There are also other kinds of food such as a chestnut-rice, sweetfish sushi, and meat-and-rice-casserole forms.

The word &quot;makuno-uchi bentō&quot; (&quot;between-act bento&quot;), dates back to the Edo period (1603 to 1867), when they were sold to theatre-goers during the intermissions () of Noh and Kabuki theater performances.

From the Meiji period onward, makunouchi has become a common convention for bento boxes called &quot;ekiben&quot; sold at train stations. Convenience stores also sell a bento under the makunouchi name. Though the selection and number of items in a makunouchi bento vary from store to store, it often contains more items and costs more than other bento.

<text>Christ Is Recrucified(Ο Χριστός Ξανασταυρώνεται)&quot; is a 1948 novel by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], published in the United States in 1953 in English translation as The Greek Passion and in the United Kingdom in the 1950s as Christ Recrucified&quot; (pictured).

==Plot summary==

The story concerns the attempts of a fictional Greek village community deep in Anatolia in 1921 to stage a Passion Play - which, as the title suggests, ends up with their in effect re-enacting the events of Jesus Christ&#x27;s trial, suffering and death. The name of the village is Lycovrisi (Wolf-spring), under Ottoman rule.

The village holds Passion Plays every seven years and the elders of the village choose the actors from among the villagers. Manolios, who is chosen to play the role of Christ, is a humble shepherd boy who was once a novice in a monastery. Yannakkos becomes Apostle Peter. He is a merchant-peddler who travels with his donkey through the villages and sells his items. He is warm-hearted, naïve and loves his donkey above all else. Michelis, the son of the wealthy nobleman old Patriarcheas, becomes Apostle John. Kostandis, the owner of the village café, is Apostle James the Great. He is good-hearted, willing to share, but confused. Then comes Panayotaros, who is chosen to be Judas. He is a wild, passionate man, waiting for revenge. The widow Katerina is Mary Magdalene. She is the village&#x27;s prostitute. She is beautiful, but of course an outsider in the village, not caring about anybody&#x27;s opinion. But she is the most generous one and in the end gives her life for what she believes in.

Then the Elders of Lycovrissi are introduced. There is the Priest Grigoris — a domineering man who bends God&#x27;s will to his own. Archon Patriarcheas is the leader of the village. He only lives for his own pleasure. Old Ladas is a miser who is obsessed with his money but lives in poverty so that he doesn&#x27;t have to spend any of it. Hadji Nikolis is the schoolmaster, who means well but is ineffectual, haunted by fear of his brother the priest.

The whole story is made colorful by the Turkish household consisting of the Agha, the Lord of Lycovrissi. He lives surrounded by oriental splendor, drinks himself crazy and enjoys rakı and pretty boys. He is guarded by Hussein, a giant Oriental who does everything his master asks of him.

Another character is the Priest Fotis. He comes to the village with a whole group of starved villagers from a devastated village which has been overrun by the Turks, and they are looking for shelter in Lycovrissi. Denied this by the priest Grigoris, the refugees retire to the barren slopes of the nearby mountain Sarakina, where they continue to starve.

The villagers, simple, earnest people who are fond of Manolios (who is to play Christ) Yannakos (Apostle Peter), Michelis (Apostle John) etc. are indoctrinated by the elders. The main factor is a real saintly priest, Father Fotis who comes to the village to ask for help with hundreds of hungry and dying people and who is turned away from the village and finds a refuge on the barren mountain. There he tries to survive with the help of Manolios, Yannakos, Michelis and Konstandis. Father Grigoris is afraid to lose his power over the villagers and starts a hate campaign first against the priest and his people and then against the rest of the group. At one point Manolios offers his life to save the village, but in the last minute he is saved. The venom of the village elders appalls even the Agha, but he is too comfortable and too afraid to lose his power to do anything.

Manolios loses his shepherding job and lives up on the hill praying to God and following His voice. Michelis gives up his riches and comes to live with Manolios. This of course infuriates and in the end kills his father. One main character, Panayotaros (Apostle Judas), doesn’t really change in character, but he becomes very dangerous and a real Judas. He doesn’t care for his life anymore after widow Katerina dies, for whom he has a crazy desire. He is the one who spies on the people up on the mountain and on Michelis and Manolios and reports to Father Grigoris, one of the main villains.

In the end, Father Grigoris assembles the villagers in the church, where he instructs Panayotaros to stab Manolios to death in front of the mob of baying villagers:

“For an instant Manolios’s heart failed him, he turned to the door - it was closed; he looked at the three lit lamps and, under them, the icons loaded with ex-votos: Christ, red-cheeked, with carefully combed hair, was smiling; the Virgin Mary, bending over the child was taking no interest in what was happening under her eyes. Saint John the Baptist was preaching in the desert. He raised his eyes toward the vault of the church and made out in the half-light the face of the Almighty, bending pitilessly over mankind. He looked at the crowd about him; it was as if in the darkness he saw the gleam of daggers. 
The strident voice of old Ladas squeaked once more:
“Let’s kill him!”
At the same moment, violent blows were struck upon the door; all fell silent and turned toward the entrance; furious voices could be heard distinctly:
“Open! Open!”
“That’s the voice of father Fotis!” someone cried.
“Yannakos’s voice,” said another; “the Sarakini have come to take him from us!”
The door was shaken violently, its hinges creaked; there could be heard a great tumult of men and women outside.
“Open, murderers! Have you no fear of God?” came the voice of father Fotis, distinctly.
Priest Grigoris raised his hands.
“In the name of Christ,” he cried, “ I take the sin upon me! Do it, Panayotaros.”
Panayotaros drew the dagger and turned to father Grigoris.
“With your blessing, Father!” he asked.
“With my blessing, strike!”

Priest Fotis and his people bring the dead body of Manolios to the mountain. He kneels next to him and holds his hands.

“Toward midnight the bell began ringing, calling the Christians to the church to see Christ born. One by one the doors opened and the Christians hastened toward the church, shivering with cold. The night was calm, icy, starless.”

“Priest Fotis listened to the bell pealing gaily, announcing that Christ was coming down on earth to save the world. He shook his head and heaved a sigh: In vain, my Christ, in vain, he muttered; two thousand years have gone by and men crucify You still. When will You be born, my Christ, and not be crucified any more, but live among us for eternity.”

==Adaptations==
Bohuslav Martinů wrote an opera in four acts called &quot;The Greek Passion&quot; (Czech &quot;Řecké pašije&quot;) based on the novel, with a libretto by the composer.

Jules Dassin&#x27;s film &quot;He Who Must Die&quot; (&quot;Celui qui doit mourir&quot;, 1957) is based on the novel.

Derek Carver based his stage and BBC radio play &quot;Not to Send Peace&quot; on the novel.

A six-part dramatisation of the novel by Jack Pulman was broadcast on BBC-2 in August and September 1969.

Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation produced a 50-episode TV series adaptation of the novel that was directed by Vasilis Georgiadis and aired from 1975 to 1976.

<doc id="985923" wikidata="Q1026371" url="?curid=985923" title="Kinnegad">
<text>Kinnegad () is a town in County Westmeath, Ireland. It is on the border with County Meath, near the junction of the M6 and the M4 motorways - two of Ireland&#x27;s main east–west roads. It is roughly 60 km from the capital, Dublin.

From 1996 to 2016, there was a considerable increase in Kinnegad&#x27;s population, from 517 to 2,745 inhabitants. According to the 2016 census, approximately 79% of the town&#x27;s housing stock (715 out of 907 households) was built between 1991 and 2010.

==Transport==
Kinnegad is primarily a commuter town, serving Dublin via the N4 and the M4 motorway. Citylink and Bus Éireann both serve Kinnegad towards Dublin, in addition to private company Kearns. There is no railway station in the town; it was served by the station at Hill of Down (which was originally called Kinnegad when it opened in 1847) until its closure in 1947. As of 2019, there were calls for the reopening of the train station at Killucan, to serve both Killucan and Rathwire and Kinnegad, but this is unlikely before extra capacity is available on the Dublin-Sligo railway line.

==Education==
The town has a large national school, Saint Etchen&#x27;s Kinnegad N.S. The school consists of two separate buildings, Scoil Etchen Naofa (built-in 1984) and the Cardinal Glennon building (built-in 2008). The renovation was necessary due to an increase in population. It is run by the Catholic Church but non-Catholic children can attend the school.

There was a campaign by the Kinnegad Steering Group during the 2010s in favour of the development of a secondary school in the town, but as of 2019 this had yet to materialise.

==Religious sites==

The Catholic church of St. Mary&#x27;s Church of the Assumption is in Kinnegad. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meath. The then arch-bishop, Seán Brady, visited the church on 7 June 2009, in honour of its 100-year anniversary. There are bullet holes visible in the stations of the cross in the church which were made by the Black and Tans in the 1920s.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic football team is Coralstown/Kinnegad Gaelic Football Club, which fields teams for both male and female players aged from under eight through to senior level. The club&#x27;s colours are red shirts and socks, and white shorts. The club has three pitches and a clubhouse with four dressing rooms, toilets, and a gym.

The town also has an association football club, Kinnegad Juniors Athletic Football Club, which was founded in 2005. Kinnegad Juniors play at Lagan Park (now known as Breedon Park) on the Killucan Road, Kinnegad. The club caters to boys and girls from the ages of 6–19 and also has a senior men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team.

<doc id="985924" wikidata="Q1548720" url="?curid=985924" title="Ulster Rugby">
<text>Ulster Rugby is one of the four professional provincial rugby union teams from the island of Ireland. They compete in the Irish regional pool of the United Rugby Championship and in the European Rugby Champions Cup, each of which they have won once. Ulster were the first Irish team and the first team outside England and France to win the European Cup in 1999.

The team represents the IRFU Ulster Branch, which is one of the four primary branches of the IRFU and is responsible for rugby union throughout the geographical Irish province of Ulster, comprising Northern Ireland (Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone) and three counties in the Republic of Ireland which are Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan.

Prior to professionalisation, Ulster were a representative amateur team taking part in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. They have also competed in the now defunct Celtic Cup (2003–05). Their development team, Ulster A, formerly known as the Ulster Ravens, have competed in the British and Irish Cup (2009–18) and a revived Celtic Cup (2018–20).

==History==

===Foundation (1868–1879)===

A number of clubs were operating in Ulster prior to the foundation of the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Ulster branch. The Belfast-based North of Ireland F.C., founded in 1868, was the earliest club to operate in the province. Clubs from this era still in existence include Dungannon and Queen&#x27;s University. The first Irish inter-provincial game took place in 1875 between Ulster and Leinster, with Ulster being the victors. In &#x27;s first international match, which was played in 1875 against , eight Ulster-based players took part. Rugby in Ulster at this time was mostly overseen by the Irish Football Union, with the Northern Football Union of Ireland controlling the game in Belfast. The two unions amalgamated in 1879, with the provincial branches of Ulster, Leinster and Munster being founded as part of the terms of this arrangement. The final Irish provincial side, Connacht, was founded in 1885.

===Amateur era (1879–1995)===
During the amateur era Irish players primarily played for their respective clubs, with provincial games effectively treated as Irish trial matches. The provincial teams were also used to provide competitive club opposition for touring international sides. Inter-provincial games were played on an irregular basis but starting in the 1946–47 season, the provinces played against each other in the annual Irish Interprovincial Championship. Ulster won this tournament 26 times in total, with eight of these titles being shared.

Ulster first appointed a coach in 1969. The first three coaches enjoyed great success in the Interprovincial Championship. Under Ken Armstrong Ulster won the title unbeaten in 1969 and 1970, and finished second, losing only once, in 1971. He was succeeded by Maurice Crabbe, under whom Ulster shared the title in 1972, came third in 1973, and won it in 1974. George Spotswood then led Ulster to a shared title in 1975, an unbeaten championship in 1976, and another shared title in 1976. Under Cecil Watson, Ulster came third in 1978 and fourth in 1979, and came third in 1980 under Matt Gillen, before form began to return under Willie John McBride, who led them to second place in 1981 and a shared title in 1982.

Their most sustained period of success began under Jimmy Davidson. In his first season, 1983, Ulster finished third, before he led them to three straight undefeated championships in 1984–86. Harry Williams succeeded him, and under him Ulster shared the title in 1987 and won three straight undefeated titles in 1988–90. Then Davy McMaster led Ulster to two undefeated titles in 1991 and 1992, and a shared title in 1991. Under these three coaches, Ulster won or shared ten Interprovincial Championships in a row.

Brian Bloomfield was the final coach of the amateur era, coming joint second in 1994.

===Professional success (1999–2006)===
After rugby union was declared open to professionalism in 1995, the IRFU gradually developed the provincial sides as professional teams. The Heineken Cup was launched in 1995 to provide a new level of European cross-border competition, and Ulster, coached by Harry Williams and captained by David Humphreys, became the first Irish team to win it in the 1998–99 season, beating beat French side US Colomiers 21–6 in the final at Lansdowne Road in Dublin.

The Celtic League, featuring all four Irish provinces plus teams from Scotland and Wales, was launched in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, the Ulster team was coached by Alan Solomons, a former assistant coach of the Springboks and head coach of The Stormers and Western Province in his native South Africa. Solomons coached Ulster to a three-year unbeaten home record in the Heineken Cup. In the 2003–04 season, Ulster finished second in the Celtic League, only overtaken by Llanelli on the final day of the campaign. Two of Ulster&#x27;s most impressive achievements in this period were a 33–0 win over English giants Leicester Tigers in the Heineken Cup in January 2004, and winning the inaugural Celtic Cup on 20 December 2003, beating Edinburgh in a rain-soaked Murrayfield final.

Solomons was succeeded by Mark McCall, former captain of the province and a member of Ulster&#x27;s Heineken Cup winning squad, with former teammate Allen Clarke as his assistant, and Ulster&#x27;s unbeaten home run in Europe was extended to four years. Dominant forward play by Australian lock Justin Harrison, New Zealand-born Irish scrum-half Isaac Boss, and a rapid maturing of a youthful home-grown three-quarter line made Ulster champions of the 2005–06 Celtic League. On the last day of the season, the title came down between Ulster and Leinster, before being decided in Ulster&#x27;s favour by a 40-metre David Humphreys drop goal against Ospreys.

===Decline (2006–2010)===
Ulster started the 2006–07 season well, including beating Toulouse 30–3 in the Heineken Cup. But this form did not continue, they were eliminated from the competition early, and finished fifth in the Celtic League. Back row forward Roger Wilson was Player of the Year.
The team began the 2007-08 season with a poor run of results, and Mark McCall resigned in November following Ulster&#x27;s embarrassing 32–14 home defeat to Gloucester in the opening round of the 2007–08 Heineken Cup. Assistant coach Steve Williams took temporary charge, and Matt Williams took charge in February, but failed to turn the season around, with Ulster finishing 9th in the 10 team Celtic League. Centre Darren Cave made his debut from the academy. At the end of the season wing Tommy Bowe, who was named Player of the Year, left for Ospreys. Roger Wilson went to Northampton Saints. Out-half David Humphreys retired, and was appointed the province&#x27;s Director of Operations.

The following season out-half Ian Humphreys, David&#x27;s younger brother, was signed from Leicester Tigers. Ulster finished third in their Heineken Cup group and eighth in the Celtic League, and Williams resigned. Hooker Rory Best was Player of the Year.

For the 2009-10 season a new management structure was put in place, with David Humphreys as director of rugby and Brian McLaughlin as head coach, assisted by Jeremy Davidson and Neil Doak. New signings included lock Dan Tuohy from Exeter. Centre Nevin Spence made his debut from the academy. The season saw an improvement in Ulster&#x27;s Heineken Cup form, including their first away win in England against Bath, but they finished eighth in the Celtic League. Flanker Chris Henry was Player of the Year. At the end of the season, scrum-half Isaac Boss left for Leinster, and prop Justin Fitzpatrick retired.

===Revival (2010–2014)===
The 2010-11 season saw significant improvement. Ulster signed key players including 2007 Rugby World Cup winning Springboks Ruan Pienaar and Johann Muller. Out-half Paddy Jackson. and centre Luke Marshall made their debuts from the academy. Ulster made the semi-finals of the Celtic League and the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup. Ruan Pienaar was Player of the Year.

New signings for the 2011-12 season included prop John Afoa and utility back Jared Payne. Academy lock Iain Henderson made his senior debut. Ulster reached the Heineken Cup final, losing to Leinster at Twickenham. The Celtic League had been renamed the Pro12 after the addition of two Italian teams, and Ulster finished sixth. Brian McLaughlin was replaced as head coach by Mark Anscombe. Flanker Chris Henry was Player of the Year.

New signings for the 2012–13 season included back row forward Nick Williams from the now defunct Aironi, wing Tommy Bowe, returning from his four-year stay at the Ospreys, back row forward Roger Wilson, returning from Northampton Saints, and Irish-qualified South African hooker Rob Herring, initially on a six-month trial. Out-half Ian Humphreys left for London Irish. Centre Nevin Spence died in an accident at the family farm. Ulster started the season with 13 consecutive wins in all competitions, the longest unbeaten run in their history. They finished top of their group in the Heineken Cup, qualifying for the quarter-finals, where they lost to Northampton Saints. They finished top of the table in the Pro12, earning a home semi-final, in which they defeated Scarlets 27–16 in the last match before the old grandstand was demolished. The redevelopment of Ravenhill meant the final against Leinster had to be played at the RDS Arena in Dublin. Leinster won 24–18. Lock Alan O&#x27;Connor made his debut from the academy this season. Wing Andrew Trimble was Player of the Year.

The 2013–14 season proved trophyless again. For the first time, Ulster won all their Heineken Cup group games, with away victories against Montpellier and Leicester Tigers being the highlight. They were knocked out at the quarterfinal stage with a 17–15 home defeat to Saracens. The Pro12 season was racked with inconsistency and Ulster finished the league season in fourth place. This set up an away semi-final with Leinster, and for the fourth time in four seasons the season was ended by their old foes with a 13–9 defeat. Centre Stuart McCloskey and prop Andrew Warwick made their debuts from the academy. Andrew Trimble was Player of the Year for the second year running. The season ended with the retirements of captain Johann Muller, centre Paddy Wallace, and flanker Stephen Ferris. Director of Rugby David Humphreys also left the province to take up a similar position at Gloucester Rugby. Following Humphreys&#x27; departure, Mark Anscombe was sacked by the province and was replaced by Ireland defence coach Les Kiss on an interim basis.

===2014–17 – the Les Kiss years===

The 2014–15 season was Ulster&#x27;s first under director of rugby Les Kiss and head coach Neil Doak. The redeveloped Ravenhill, renamed the Kingspan Stadium, now had a capacity of 18,196. Rory Best was named captain after the retirement of Johann Muller. New signings included out-half Ian Humphreys, returning from London Irish, lock Franco van der Merwe from the Lions, outside back Louis Ludik from Agen, and flanker Sean Reidy from Counties Manukau. Ulster were knocked out of the new European Champions Cup at the group stage. They finished fourth in the Pro12 but narrowly lost in the playoff semifinal to eventual champions Glasgow Warriors. Prop Declan Fitzpatrick retired at the end of the season. Wing Craig Gilroy was named Player of the Year.

In 2015–16, Ulster were knocked out of the Champions Cup at the group stage despite a memorable back to back win over Toulouse. They finished fourth in the Pro12 but reached the semi-finals, losing to Leinster. Wing Jacob Stockdale made his debut from the academy. Centre Stuart McCloskey was Player of the Year.

Before the 2016–17 season, Nick Williams left for Cardiff Blues and Dan Tuohy for Bristol Bears, and Ian Humphreys retired. Ulster signed back row forward Marcell Coetzee, fullback Charles Piutau and lock Kieran Treadwell. Academy flanker Nick Timoney made his debut. Ulster finished the season bottom of their pool in the Heineken Cup, and fifth in the Pro12. Charles Piutau was Player of the Year.

===2017–18 - the &quot;basket case&quot; season===
For the 2017–18 season, the Pro12 became the Pro14 with the addition of two South African teams. Head coach Neil Doak&#x27;s contract was not renewed and he was replaced by Jono Gibbes. Assistant coach Allen Clarke also left, replaced by Dwayne Peel. All-time appearance holder Roger Wilson retired, and scrum-half Ruan Pienaar was blocked by the IRFU from extending his contract. John Cooney was signed from Connacht to replace him.

Before the season started, out-half Paddy Jackson and centre Stuart Olding were charged with rape and suspended from playing pending trial. Both would be acquitted, but have their contracts revoked. Australian out-half Christian Lealiifano was signed on loan. Prop Tom O&#x27;Toole made his debut from the academy. After a poor run of form over the Christmas period, Les Kiss resigned as Director of Rugby, and Gibbes cut his contract short, leaving at the end of the season. Ulster finished third in their Champions Cup pool, and fourth in Conference B of the Pro14, failing to qualify for the playoffs and needing to win a playoff to qualify for the next season&#x27;s Champions Cup. Former Ireland captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll described the province as &quot;a bit of a basket case&quot;, facing &quot;Administration issues, senior players retiring, the well documented court case, now no number 10 to build the team around, no coach next year, struggling for Champions Cup rugby next season.&quot; Scrum-half John Cooney was named Player of the Year.

===2018–24: the Dan McFarland years===
For the 2018–19 season Dan McFarland was brought in as the new head coach. Jared Payne, Tommy Bowe, Andrew Trimble and Chris Henry all retired, and Charles Piutau left for Bristol Bears. Out-half Billy Burns was signed from Gloucester, prop Marty Moore from Wasps, flanker Jordi Murphy from Leinster, and utility back Will Addison from Sale Sharks. Prop Eric O&#x27;Sullivan, wing Robert Baloucoune, centre James Hume, fullback Michael Lowry and flanker Marcus Rea all made their debuts from the academy. Ulster finished the season as quarter-finalists in the Champions Cup, and semi-finalists in the Pro14, losing to Glasgow Warriors. Rory Best and Darren Cave retired at the end of the season. Centre Stuart McCloskey was Player of the Year for the second time.

Lock Iain Henderson was named captain for the 2019–20 season. Ulster were again quarter-finalists in the Champions Cup, going out to Toulouse, and reached the final of the Pro14, losing to Leinster. Centre Stewart Moore and wing Ethan McIlroy made their debuts from the academy, and scrum-half John Cooney was Player of the Year for the second time.

The 2020–21 season was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and games were played behind closed doors. Ulster finished second in Conference A of the Pro14, but failed to make the knockout stages of the Champions Cup and were entered into the Challenge Cup. They progressed to the semi-finals, where they were beaten by Leicester Tigers. The season&#x27;s final competition was the Pro14 Rainbow Cup, pitting the Pro14&#x27;s European teams against the four South African teams who were leaving Super Rugby. Ulster&#x27;s form in this competition was poor, and they finished tenth in the European pool. Marcell Coetzee cut short his contract and left for the Bulls before the end of the season. Academy players Cormac Izuchukwu, Nathan Doak, David McCann, Callum Reid and Aaron Sexton all made their senior debuts this season. Lock Alan O&#x27;Connor was Player of the Year.

In 2021–22 the Pro14 became the United Rugby Championship, with the addition of four new South African teams. Ulster made the semi-finals, where they narrowly lost to the Stormers in Cape Town. In the Champions Cup, they made the knockout stage, but went out in a two-legged round of sixteen playoff against Toulouse by an aggregate score of 50–49. Centre James Hume was Player of the Year.

New signings for the 2022-23 season included prop Jeffery Toomaga-Allen. Lock Harry Sheridan and centre Jude Postlethwaite made their senior debuts. Despite a poor run of results in mid-season, Ulster made the knockout stage of the Champions Cup, going out in the round of 16 to Leinster. They became the first European team in the URC to win all four league games against South African opposition, and secured a home quarter-final with a home win over the Bulls in March, which they lost to Connacht. Hooker Tom Stewart was named Player of the Year after scoring 16 tries in the URC, a league record, and 17 tries in all competitions, an Ulster record.

New signings for the 2023–24 season included prop Steven Kitshoff and flanker Dave Ewers. After a difficult first half of the season, McFarland left his position, to be replaced by assistant coach Dan Soper until after the Six Nations Under 20s Championship, after which Ireland under-20 coach Richie Murphy would take over until the end of the season. Chief Executive Jonny Petrie left not long after, replaced on an interim basis by Hugh McCaughey. Murphy signed a two-year contract in May. Ulster finished sixth in the URC, going out in the quarter-finals to Leinster, and went out of the Champions Cup at the pool stage, dropping into the Challenge Cup where they made the quarter-finals. Flanker David McCann was Player of the Season. Prop Scott Wilson made his debut from the academy.

===2024 on===
Before the 2024–25 season, Richie Murphy&#x27;s first full season in charge, there were significant changes.

==Crest==
The current crest was introduced in 2003. The new, stylised crest is made specific to Ulster Rugby as it incorporates the red hand from the provincial flag of Ulster with two rugby balls. The Ulster Rugby crest is on all official club merchandise including replica jerseys.

==Stadium==
The Ravenhill Stadium, known for sponsorship reasons as the Kingspan Stadium since 2014, opened in 1923. It has hosted two Rugby World Cup matches, several Ireland national team matches, the 2015 Pro12 Grand Final and many 2017 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup matches, including the final.

The Premium Stand opened in 2009. In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive announced that it had granted £138m for various stadium redevelopment projects throughout Northern Ireland. Ulster Rugby received £14.5m, which was used to redevelop Ravenhill and expand its capacity from 12,000 to 18,000. The rest of the redevelopment took place from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, Ulster Rugby confirmed that three new stands would be built at Ravenhill, with work commencing in late 2012. Two new stands at the Memorial and Aquinas ends of the stadium were completed while the main stand was demolished and rebuilt. The major refurbishment was completed in April 2014. After the rest of the redevelopment was completed, the stadium was renamed the Kingspan Stadium.

<doc id="985934" wikidata="Q3449759" url="?curid=985934" title="RWD 8">
<text>The RWD 8 was a Polish parasol wing monoplane trainer aircraft produced by RWD. It was used from 1934 to 1939 by the Polish Air Force and civilian aviation.

==Development==
The RWD 8 was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement in 1931 for a basic trainer aircraft. It was designed by the RWD team of Stanisław Rogalski, Stanisław Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki. The first prototype (registration SP-AKL), was flown in early 1933. It won the contest for the new Polish military trainer, against the PZL-5bis and Bartel BM-4h biplanes. It was considered a very stable and well-handling aircraft.

Since the DWL (&quot;Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze&quot;) workshops – a manufacturer of RWD designs – had limited production capability, the Polish military decided to produce the aircraft in a nationalized factory PWS (&quot;Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów&quot;). DWL gave away the licence free of charge, only for covering design costs. PWS produced aircraft for both military and civilian aviation, while DWL produced aircraft for civilian use only. The first PWS-built RWD 8 was flown in September 1934. These aircraft, designated RWD 8 PWS (or RWD 8 pws), differed from the original RWD 8 DWL (or RWD 8 dwl) in minor details, mainly having thinner landing gear shock absorbers and being slightly heavier and therefore slower.

Apart from the standard variant, 50 RWD 8a PWS were built with an additional 95 L (25 U.S. gal) fuel tank in thicker central wing section, giving increased range. A small series was built with a rear cab covered with blinds, for blind flying training. A frame with a hook for glider towing could be attached to the aircraft. A further development of the RWD 8 was the aerobatics and training aircraft, the RWD-17.

In total, over 550 RWD 8s were built (about 80 by DWL and about 470 by PWS). Production ceased in early 1939. The RWD 8 was the most numerous aircraft manufactured in Poland up to that time. Small series of license-built produced 1935 by Rogožarski Belgrade (three aircraft).

===Technical description===
The RWD 8 was conventional in layout, and had mixed construction (steel and wood frame with canvas and plywood covering). The crew of two, sitting in tandem, were in an open cockpit, with individual windshields. Twin controls were fitted. Power came from a 4-cylinder air-cooled 90 kW (120 hp) straight engine PZInż. Junior (licence built Walter Junior) (82 kW /110 hp nominal power), 120 hp Walter Major or de Havilland Gipsy Major. A two-blade wooden propeller was fitted. The aircraft had a conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. The fuel tank in fuselage had 75 L (18 U.S. gal) (RWD 8 PWS) or 85 L (21 U.S. gal) (RWD 8 DWL). The wings folded rearwards.

==Operational history==

RWD 8s were used in the Polish military trainer aviation from 1934, becoming a standard type of primary trainer. In November 1938, there were 349 RWD 8s in the Air Force. RWD 8s were also used in Polish civilian aviation – particularly in regional aeroclubs. More than 80 aircraft were bought for public collection funds, in order to train aviators. They were also used in the Polish aviation sport.

A small number were exported: three were sold to Palestine, one to Spain, Morocco and Brazil. Licences for building the RWD 8 was sold to Estonia (one aircraft was produced, with markings ES-RWD) and Rogozarski of Yugoslavia (a small series with radial engines was built). At least one RWD 8 was sold to Spain via Portugal during the Spanish Civil War. It was used as a reconnaissance aircraft and a trainer for the Nationalist forces.

In the invasion of Poland 1939, the RWD 8s were used in 13 liaison flights, three aircraft in each, assigned to Armies. Many other aircraft were mobilized during the campaign and used in improvised liaison units. An advantage of the RWD 8 was its capability for short take off and landing on unprepared fields, but the missions of their crews were dangerous. RWD 8s of the Polesie Operational Group were the last Polish aircraft in the sky during the campaign. They were flying reconnaissance missions during the Battle of Kock, and even threw hand grenades.

A great number of RWD 8s were bombed by the Germans in air bases (unlike Polish combat aircraft) or burned by withdrawing Poles. A total of 57 aircraft were withdrawn to Romania, about 40 to Latvia and 2 to Hungary. Only some dozen aircraft were captured by the Germans in airworthy condition. In Romania and Hungary they were used until the late 1940s. None returned to Poland after the war, and today, none have survived.

<doc id="985935" wikidata="Q500589" url="?curid=985935" title="Herman Munster">
<text>Herman Munster is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Munsters&quot;, originally played by Fred Gwynne. The patriarch of the Munster household, Herman is one of Frankenstein’s monsters, created in a lab in Germany in the nineteenth century.

==Origins==
In the context of the series, Herman was created in 1815 at the University of Heidelberg by Dr. Victor Frankenstein. He has a twin brother, Charlie. Leaving (Germany) for Great Britain at a young age, Herman was adopted by the Munsters of Munster Hall, a noble family living in the fictitious Shroudshire, England.

At some point Herman moved to Transylvania (a region in Romania), where he met Lily Dracula. In 1865 (technically at the age of 15, but physically older) Herman married Lily, and eventually the couple and Grandpa (Lily&#x27;s father) moved to America, where Herman joined the U.S. Army, fighting in World War II. In episode 34, Grandpa says that it was thanks to Herman that he was able to leave Transylvania and have a better life in America.

==Family relations==

In &quot;The Munsters Today&quot;, he, as now portrayed by John Schuck, is given a younger brother named Frank. And in the 1995 movie &quot;Here Come the Munsters&quot; he is given a sister named Elsa who resembles the Bride of Frankenstein. She is also married to Mr. Hyde, who transforms into Dr. Jekyll.

==In the series==
Herman is employed by Gateman, Goodbury and Graves, a funeral home in Mockingbird Heights, having started out as a &quot;box boy c. 1953.&quot; Herman&#x27;s co-workers sometimes remark on his height and strength, but otherwise do not appear to find his appearance and color (green) out of the ordinary. Occasionally, Herman is picked up by &quot;the company car&quot; (a hearse), which he climbs into via the back door and rides as if he were a body being delivered.

==Description==

Herman is a lovable, good-natured, and clumsy buffoon. Despite having been alive for over a century, he behaves rather childishly, often throwing temper tantrums, punctuated with thundering animalish roaring. In spite of his childish behaviors, he is a caring father figure to his son Eddie and a loving, devoted husband. He is very kind to everyone, but he is also very naive, often misunderstanding situations or falling for various schemes. He occasionally has problems recognizing when someone has malicious or dishonest intentions towards him. Most people, however, flee in terror on seeing Herman&#x27;s monstrous visage, which he always attributes to something else. In some instances, his presence has caused inanimate objects or artwork to come to life and flee in terror: such as a statue of Daniel Boone in a park, a stuffed gorilla in a museum, and a graffiti drawing of a face in a jail cell starting out smiling and the facial expression changes to terror.

Herman is incredibly strong, once lifting a solid metal demolition ball casually with one hand. He is almost immovable; a number of times, cars have run into him without causing him injury. A safe fell on his head (&quot;John Doe Munster&quot;) and gave him amnesia, although it did not hurt him. When asked how much he weighs, Herman says: &quot;Three spins&quot;, meaning the dial on the scale goes around three times. In the episode &quot;Herman&#x27;s Lawsuit&quot;, his driver&#x27;s license gives his weight as , height as , and eyes as brown. (On the other hand, in the episode &quot;All-Star Munster,&quot; Herman, when asked his height, states &quot;seven-foot three&quot; but when asked how tall he is in his stocking feet, he replies, &quot;Seven foot four – I wear very thick socks.&quot;) In the episode &quot;Munster the Magnificent&quot;, his shoe size is said to be 26. Herman considers himself handsome (as does the rest of his family) even though he can crack a mirror by looking at it, once even cracking a shiny frying pan he looked into. In one episode, Herman is struck by lightning, reverting to a &quot;hideous&quot; form (actually Fred Gwynne without any make-up). He tries to hide his appearance from all those around him until two more lightning strikes make him a woman first and then the second one reverts him back to &quot;handsome&quot; Herman. In earlier episodes, Herman has hair on the back of his hands (only seen in closeups). And a common joke is that when he shakes hands with a blind neighbour of his, they believe that they are holding a dog&#x27;s paw.

When frustrated (often), he tends to stamp like a child having a tantrum causing plaster to shower down from the ceiling. His strength is especially useful around &quot;the Parlor&quot; – he can lift occupied caskets unassisted. Herman has a very distinctive laugh;... a loud braying bellow. Occasionally he is shown grunting and making guttural sounds (similar to Boris Karloff&#x27;s Frankenstein&#x27;s monster), usually when he&#x27;s hungry, impatient or getting annoyed over a minor problem (such as finding his Sunday newspaper).

In keeping with his childlike personality, Herman loves balloons, candy, and especially his wife Lily&#x27;s pancakes. He plays with toys, such as his son Eddie&#x27;s cowboy hat and cap pistols (in &quot;Herman&#x27;s Happy Valley&quot;). He loves to read comic books despite Lily&#x27;s annoyance at such childish behavior.

Despite being of German origin and having been raised in England, Herman speaks with a cultured American accent. He does however read German newspapers, which is subtly shown in at least one episode: He is reading a paper, conversing about an unrelated topic, and as the camera gets close enough to his face, it can be seen for a fraction of a second that it is &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. In episode &quot;My Fair Munster&quot;, he reads &quot;Die Welt&quot;.

==Merchandising==
In 1964 Mattel released a Herman Munster doll that featured Gwynne&#x27;s voice and spoke ten phrases at random with the pull of its &quot;Chatty Ring&quot; cord. This was a spin-off of their highly successful Chatty Cathy doll, for whom the talking mechanism had been invented.

<text>The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 (20 Geo. 2. c. 42) was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain that created a statutory definition of England as including England, Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed. 

The walled garrison town of Berwick changed hands numerous times before the crowns of England and Scotland were united in 1603. 

== Provisions ==
The act created a statutory definition of England as including England, Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed. This definition applied to all Acts passed before and after the Act&#x27;s coming into force, unless a given Act provided an alternative definition. According to Blackstone, the Act &quot;perhaps superfluously&quot; made explicit what was previously implicit.

The town of Berwick was variously under the control of the English and Scottish crowns before the crowns were united in 1603.

Berwick had historically been a royal burgh in Scotland before the two kingdoms merged to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The Act confirmed that English and not Scottish law would apply to Berwick.

Of the original act&#x27;s four sections, only section 3 related to Wales and Berwick; sections 1 and 2 regulated collection of window tax and section 4 permitted Quaker officials to replace the prescribed oath of fidelity with a declaration, owing to their objection to oath-taking. The short title &#x27;Wales and Berwick Act 1746&#x27; was introduced after the other sections had been repealed; today it is authorised by the Short Titles Act 1896.

== Repeal ==
The act was repealed with regard to Wales by the Welsh Language Act 1967, and in its entirety by the Interpretation Act 1978. 

The Local Government Act 1972, which came into force on 1 April 1974, explicitly stated that in future legislation &#x27;England&#x27; would consist of the 46 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties established by the act (which included Berwick) and that &#x27;Wales&#x27; would consist of the eight Welsh counties established by the act. This also had the effect of ending debate on whether Monmouthshire was a part of Wales, or of England. The administration of law had been attached to one of the English law circuits, Oxford, and the Local Government Act 1933 had listed both Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport as parts of England. The Interpretation Act 1978 restated the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 with respect to legislation passed after 1 April 1974 and noted explicitly that in legislation enacted before then England included Berwick and Monmouthshire; and also that in legislation prior to 1967 it still included Wales.

<text>A lifestyle business (also referred to as a lifestyle venture) is a business set up and run by its founders primarily with the aim of living or maintaining a certain lifestyle. It&#x27;s meant to be a business which adjusts to the lifestyle - so that the founder can live their life as they like (and oftentimes already do).

Some types of enterprise are more accessible than others to the would-be lifestyle business person. Those requiring extensive capital (for example: car manufacturing) are difficult to launch and sustain on a lifestyle basis; others such as small creative industries businesses are more practical for sole practitioners or small groups such as husband-and-wife teams.

Lifestyle businesses typically have limited scalability and potential for growth because such growth would destroy the lifestyle for which their owner-managers set them up. However, lifestyle businesses can and do win awards and provide satisfaction to their owners and customers. If sufficient high-quality creative producers begin to naturally cluster together, such as in Brighton, England, during the 1990s, the perception of a place can be radically changed (see Porter&#x27;s cluster).

==Cultural context==

The term is used in both favorable and derogatory meaning. An example of individuals who promote the concept of lifestyle businesses favorably include Tim Ferriss&#x27;s The 4-Hour Workweek and other numerous blogs that emphasize the concept of passive income with the same goal of lifestyle businesses. These individuals create an image of lifestyle businesses and passive income that promotes an easy lifestyle and something that individuals should aspire towards. In the derogatory sense, a business started with the intention of becoming a startup, but which instead becomes a smaller business is often referred to as a lifestyle business by investors or other detractors.

== Features of a lifestyle business ==

* Owner-focused– A lifestyle business is typically created to support the owner&#x27;s lifestyle, rather than being solely focused on maximizing profits or growth.
* Work-life balance– The owner of a lifestyle business typically seeks to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and may prioritize flexibility and time off over rapid growth or expansion.
* Low overhead costs– Because lifestyle businesses are often small and owner-operated and may be run from home or a small office. This feature makes it have low overhead costs.
* Owner dependent– Lifestyle business is highly dependent on the owner in that the entrepreneur needs to be actively working to make money. When there is no active work being done, there are high chances of little to even no money being made.
* Creativity– Lifestyle businesses often allow the entrepreneur to express their creativity and pursue their passions, such as a love for cooking, fashion, art etc.

<doc id="985940" wikidata="Q5920208" url="?curid=985940" title="Howard Lew Lewis">
<text>Howard Lew Lewis (21 August 1941 – 20 January 2018) (born Howard R. Lewis) was an English comedian and actor, best known for his roles in comedy series including &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;, &quot;Brush Strokes&quot; and &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot;.

==Biography==
Lewis was born in London, England. His parents were both born in southern Wales (Tenby and Bridgend). As a young man, Lewis flat-shared with Ken Morley (Reg Holdsworth of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;) and Andy Carr, actor and screenwriter. His first job was with the Royal Air Force, where he was a computer operator. He worked for several years in computing and telecommunications, but when promoted to manager-level he decided instead to pursue acting as a career after being asked to fire a colleague whom he believed to be a good worker. He was married twice. His first marriage lasted just over a year. His second marriage was to Anna Goodall. They married in 1990 with Ken Morley as best man.

==Television==
One of his more notable roles was as Rabies, one of the Merry Men in the BBC children&#x27;s television comedy series &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot; where he appeared in all 26 episodes. He also had a prominent part as the dim barman Elmo Putney in the BBC sitcom &quot;Brush Strokes&quot; between 1986-91.

Lewis also featured in &quot;Now You See Them&quot;, a 1988 episode of the ITV anthology drama series &quot;Dramarama.&quot;

He appeared in two other prominent historical comedy series - as Blag in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; (1988) set during the Roman occupation of Britain in AD 123, and as assorted medieval peasants, (including Piers and Mr Applebottom) in &quot;The Black Adder&quot; (1983) and he had minor parts in two Ronnie Barker sitcoms - &quot;The Magnificent Evans&quot; (1984) and &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1985) - and the ITV comedy-drama &quot;Minder&quot; (1984).
==Films==
Lewis appeared in several films, again mostly in minor roles. Notable film appearances included Terry Gilliam&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Brazil&quot;, where he played one of the Black Maria guards, and as one of Robin Hood&#x27;s followers in the 1991 film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, playing a character named Hal.

He also appeared in the 1992 Oscar-nominated semi-biographical film &quot;Chaplin&quot;, and was the English language voice of Obelix in the 1994 film of &quot;Asterix in America&quot; to Craig Charles&#x27; Asterix. In 2005, he played the part of Lillas Pastia, the innkeeper, in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall, London, and in 2007, played alongside Warwick Davis in the film &quot;Small Town Folk&quot;.

== Death ==
In an interview with the &quot;Scottish Mail on Sunday&quot; in late 2017, Lewis confirmed he had been diagnosed with dementia. His fellow actor and friend Tony Robinson announced on Twitter on 22 January 2018 that Lewis had died on 20 January 2018.

On 28 January 2018, it was reported that police in Edinburgh were investigating the circumstances surrounding the actor&#x27;s death after his step-daughter Debora Milazzo claimed he had been placed on a regime of high-dose sedatives and maximum-strength opiate painkillers, and had been needlessly placed on the kind of treatment plan that would be prescribed for the terminal phase of a malignant disease, explaining that her father had not received a terminal diagnosis. Police Scotland confirmed it was investigating the complaint.

<doc id="985942" wikidata="Q1126167" url="?curid=985942" title="Connacht Rugby">
<text>Connacht Rugby () is one of the four professional provincial rugby teams from the island of Ireland. Connacht competes in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup. The team represents the IRFU Connacht Branch, which is one of four primary branches of the IRFU, and is responsible for rugby union throughout the geographical Irish province of Connacht.

Connacht plays its home games at the Dexcom Stadium, which currently holds 6,126 spectators and can be expanded to 8,129. Connacht play in a predominantly green jersey, shorts and socks. The Connacht Rugby crest is a modified version of the provincial flag of Connacht and consists of a dimidiated eagle and an arm wielding a sword.

With the province containing just over 8% of the total Irish population, Connacht has a much smaller base of rugby union players to choose from than the other three provinces. This player base is also affected by the relative popularity of Gaelic Athletic Association sports such as hurling and Gaelic football. In the early years of professionalism, it was suggested that the Connacht team as a professional entity should be wound up, and fans had to demonstrate to save the province. However, rugby union in Connacht has expanded significantly with increased ticket sales and stadium expansion, in particular since its first season competing in the Heineken Cup. 

Through the efforts of the Connacht Branch and the support of the IRFU, the province has experienced growth, increasing its underage and schools participation through initiatives such as the &quot;Grassroots to Greenshirts&quot; campaign. Connacht enjoyed their most significant senior success in 2016, when they defeated fellow Irish province Leinster in the 2016 Pro12 Grand Final to win the competition for the first time. In 2025, while their home stadium in Galway, Dexcom Stadium, was partly closed for expansion works, Connacht agreed to move one URC match with Munster to MacHale Park, a 25,000 seat Gaelic Athletic Association stadium in Castlebar, County Mayo, which sold out in the space of two days and is set to be the largest home attendance for a Connacht Rugby game in history.

The province also has a developmental side, which plays in the Celtic Cup under a version of the Connacht Rugby brand. Before the creation of the Celtic Cup, the Connacht Eagles competed in the British and Irish Cup.

==History==
===Foundation and amateur era (1885–1995)===
The Connacht Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union was founded on 8 December 1885, and along with it the provincial team. The branch was formed to compete with the Leinster, Munster and Ulster branches, which were founded in 1879, and whose teams had been formed in 1875. There were six teams represented at the meeting in Dublin that founded the Connacht Branch. These were Ballinasloe, Castlebar, Galway Town, Galway Grammar School, Queen&#x27;s College Galway and Ranelagh School Athlone. Galway Grammar and Ranelagh have both closed since, while Galwegians was formed out of Galway Town in 1922. Ballinasloe merged with Athlone to form Buccaneers in 1994, but has since been reestablished as an independent club. Castlebar and Queen&#x27;s College (now NUI Galway) are the only two founding clubs to have remained active without interruption since the branch was founded. The province is currently made up of 25 senior clubs.

Cape Town-born Henry Anderson was the first Connacht player to receive an cap, making his debut against on 14 February 1903. Anderson later went on to be one of the founders of Galwegians, and became the first Connacht branch representative to serve as president of the IRFU. Sligo-born Aengus McMorrow followed in his footsteps to become the first Connacht native player to represent Ireland in 1951. Ballinasloe man Ray McLoughlin was the first Connacht player to captain Ireland, when he led the team in the 1965 Five Nations Championship. McLoughlin also became the first Connacht representative for the Lions when he took part in the 1966 tour to Australia and New Zealand, though he was playing his club rugby for Gosforth in England at the time. Ciaran Fitzgerald became the first Connacht man to captain the Lions when he was chosen by Jim Telfer to lead the 1983 tour to New Zealand.

During the amateur era Irish players primarily played for their respective clubs, with provincial games effectively treated as Irish trial matches. The provincial teams were also used to provide competitive club opposition for touring international sides. Beginning in the 1946–47 season, the provinces played against each other in the annual IRFU Interprovincial Rugby Championship. This was a round-robin tournament which, during the amateur era, consisted of one game against each opponent. In the 1980s, to compensate for Connacht&#x27;s smaller playing base, the IRFU decreed that any English-born Irish international players must represent Connacht in the Championship. However, towards the end of the amateur era in the 1990s, this edict was reversed with the Championship also contested by the Irish Exiles team, consisting of Irish-qualified players in Britain and France. Connacht won the tournament on three occasions, in 1956, 1957 and 1965, although on each occasion the title was shared.

===Early professional years (1995–2003)===

On 26 August 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an &quot;open&quot; game, removing all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. this was done due to a committee conclusion having an open game was the only way to end the hypocrisy of shamateurism, and keep control of the sport. The threat to amateur rugby union mostly prevalent in the Southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia, where Super League was threatening to entice players to rugby league with large salaries. In Ireland, the four provincial teams were the only teams to go professional, while their constituent clubs remained amateur.

The 1995–96 season saw the first ever Heineken Cup, a new tournament set up for European clubs. The Irish were allocated three places in the competition, with these places going to Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The following season saw the launch of a secondary European competition, the European Challenge Cup. Connacht were coached that season by former All Black Warren Gatland, who had previously coached Galwegians. The inaugural Challenge Cup, then also known as the European Shield, saw Connacht finish fourth from six teams in their group, which also contained Toulon and the Northampton Saints.

The 1997–98 Challenge Cup proved far more successful for Connacht. The team, still coached by Gatland, finished top of their group; the number of teams in each group having been reduced to four. Connacht won five of their six matches including beating Northampton both at home and away. The win in Northampton and victory over Bordeaux-Bègles in Stade André Moga made Connacht the first professional Irish team to beat an English team in England and a French team in France respectively. In the quarter-final they played SU Agen away in the Stade Armandie, but lost 40–27. Gatland left his position as Connacht coach at the end of the season, taking over as Ireland coach.

Another New Zealander, Glenn Ross, took over from Gatland. In his two seasons, Connacht failed to make it out of the pool stages of the Challenge Cup, and Ross resigned at the end of the 1999–2000 season. He was replaced by South African coach Steph Nel. Nel&#x27;s initial two seasons also saw Connacht knocked out of the Challenge Cup during the group stages. 2001 saw the formation of a new competition called the Celtic League, which was created to serve as a championship for Irish, Scottish and Welsh clubs. Connacht made it to the quarter-finals in the inaugural season, where they were beaten by Scotland&#x27;s Glasgow Warriors, by a final score of 29–34. In the 2002–03 season the team again reached the quarters. This time, however, they were beaten by a much greater margin, losing to Irish rivals Munster by a score of 33–3. Meanwhile, in the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup, they reached the quarter-finals, being knocked out by a margin of 8 points over two legs, against Welsh team Pontypridd.

Off the field, however, the province&#x27;s future was under threat. The IRFU proposed shutting down Connacht Rugby as a professional team in 2003 to cut costs, in light of the IRFU&#x27;s annual deficit of €4 million. This was averted when a public protest with 2,000 fans marching on the IRFU headquarters in Dublin, coupled with the possibility of a strike by the Irish Rugby Union Players Association, forced the IRFU to reverse course and maintain the team.

===Michael Bradley era (2003–2010)===
Michael Bradley took charge of Connacht in 2003, coming in from the Irish under-age set up to replace Steph Nel. Connacht Rugby&#x27;s average crowd was 600 supporters and the IRFU allotted a budget which was less than 50% of either of the other three Irish provinces. In Bradley&#x27;s first Celtic League season, Connacht finished ninth from 12 teams, ahead of only the Scottish sides, but 2003–04 was the most successful season in European competition in the province&#x27;s history to date. Connacht reached the semi-finals of that year&#x27;s European Challenge Cup, and came within touching distance of the decider, but a try from the Harlequins centre Will Greenwood, 12 minutes from time in the second leg of their semi-final, denied them a place in the final. Connacht also got to the semi-final of the Celtic Cup. Despite this, Connacht fell further in the Celtic League the following season. The team finished one place from the bottom in 2004–05, in what was now an 11 team competition. Still, the team continued their European form in the 2004–05 European Challenge Cup, reaching the semi-finals a second season. Once again, they were knocked out over two legs by the eventual winners of the competition, this time Sale Sharks.
With the Union holding a tight grip on the purse strings Connacht continued to struggle in the Celtic League, finishing in tenth place from 11 in both the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In these seasons, however their European form could not make up for the domestic performances. Though they reached the quarter-finals of the 2005–06 Challenge Cup, they suffered a 23–3 defeat to Newcastle Falcons, before failing to advance through the pool stages in 2006–07. These seasons, however, saw the beginning of a new dimension to Connacht&#x27;s player recruitment, whereby the province would bring Irish players back from abroad, to compete for Irish selection. Examples include the transfers of Gavin Duffy from Harlequins, Johnny O&#x27;Connor from London Wasps and Frank Murphy from Leicester Tigers.

The 2007–08 Celtic League saw the competition reduced to ten teams, following the exit of Border Reivers, and the season ended with Connacht bottom of the table, having won only five of their 18 matches. They also finished third in their Challenge Cup pool, again being knocked out early. In the 2008–09 season Connacht were able to finish second in their pool and advance to the quarter-finals, but were beaten 42–13 by Northampton Saints. Without any meaningful increase in the budget, the management team struggled to improve the quality of the playing squad as a whole and they failed to improve in the Celtic League, finishing last again in 2008–09, this time 13 points from the next team up the table.

Bradley announced early in the 2009–10 season that he intended to step down at the end of the year. His final season followed a similar pattern to his first two seasons as coach, with the team again finishing last in the League, though the gap was narrower than the previous year. As in Bradley&#x27;s earlier seasons, however, Connacht were able to leave their poor form in the league behind when it came to playing in the Challenge Cup. They topped their pool comfortably, winning all six games with two try bonus points, and proceeded to the quarter-finals as top seeds. For the first time in the club&#x27;s history the team had achieved the highest points total at the pool stages of any team in either European competition. In the quarters, they faced French Top 14 side Bourgoin, beating them 23–20, with a late Miah Nikora drop goal. Connacht advanced to the semi-finals where, on 30 April 2010, they faced a Toulon team featuring the English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. Toulon won 19–12 in Galway, with Wilkinson kicking 14 of the French club&#x27;s points. This season also saw veteran forward Michael Swift break the record for number of Connacht appearances. With crowds of more than 8,000 at both the quarter and semi-final stages of the Challenge Cup, and average gates of 2,600 in the Celtic League, Connacht&#x27;s structures and support had improved drastically from 2003, when the team&#x27;s survival was in question. At the end of the 2010 season, Bradley was awarded the Celtic League&#x27;s Chairman&#x27;s Award in recognition of his seven years of service to the province.

===Eric Elwood as head coach (2010–2013)===
Bradley was succeeded as Connacht boss by former Connacht and Ireland fly-half, Eric Elwood. Elwood had served as an assistant to Bradley since 2005 and had also coached the Ireland Under-20s to a grand slam in 2007&#x27;s Six Nations Under 20s Championship. His first season in charge saw two teams from Italy introduced to the Celtic League, Aironi and Benetton Treviso, which brought the number of teams back up to twelve. Connacht finished above both of the Italian teams as well as Glasgow Warriors, coming in ninth place. In the Challenge Cup, Connacht were knocked out in the pool stages, finishing second in their group behind the eventual winners of the tournament, Harlequins. During the course of the season, the loss of a number of key players, such as Seán Cronin and Ian Keatley, were announced, with the players signing to Connacht&#x27;s provincial rivals for the start of the following season.

====Heineken Cup qualification====

In 2011–12 Connacht made their first-ever Heineken Cup appearance, due to Leinster winning the 2011 Heineken Cup Final. By competition rules, introduced in the 2010–11 season, the winners of both the Heineken Cup, and the European Challenge Cup, would receive an automatic berth in the following year&#x27;s Heineken Cup. This place would then be passed on to another team from that country if the tournament winner was already qualified by domestic performance. As Leinster had qualified through performance in the 2010–11 Celtic League, Connacht claimed the extra berth.

Ahead of their first season in European Rugby&#x27;s premier club competition, Gavin Duffy replaced John Muldoon as captain of the team. Connacht lost their first five matches in the pool stages, claiming losing bonuses in both of their games with Gloucester. In the final game of their pool, however, they managed an upset, beating Harlequins 9–8 in the Sportsground, which prevented the Premiership club from topping the group, and knocked them down into the Challenge Cup. On the domestic front, the Celtic League had been renamed, given the previous season&#x27;s introduction of Italian teams to the competition. In the first season of the new &#x27;Pro12&#x27;, Connacht built on the previous year&#x27;s performance. They finished the season eighth out of twelve teams.

Entry into the Heineken Cup led to a significant increase in the club&#x27;s popularity. In summer 2011, the &quot;Connacht Clan&quot; supporters club was formed. In September 2011, Connacht season ticket sales went over the 3,000 mark for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, and average attendance for the 2011–12 season saw a 105% increase over the previous season. Connacht&#x27;s average attendance in home Pro12 matches climbed to 4,653 in the 2011–12 season, and increased further to 5,154 for the 2012–13 season. The following season saw the Connacht end in the same position as the previous year, as the team finished eighth in the Pro12. On the European stage, Connacht played in the Heineken Cup again in 2012–13, because of Leinster&#x27;s second Heineken Cup win in a row. Connacht won three of their pool matches: two against Italian team Zebre, along with a victory at home to 2009–10 finalists Biarritz. Elwood departed at the end of the season, having announced his intention to leave in October 2012.

===Pat Lam takes over (2013–2017)===
Elwood&#x27;s replacement was announced in January 2013, with the New Zealand born former Samoa international Pat Lam appointed to coach the team. Lam&#x27;s first competitive game in charge was in the 2013–14 Pro12, a 25–16 home win over Zebre but following this game, Connacht suffered a number of league defeats in a row. On 21 December 2013, they overcame Newport Gwent Dragons 14–11 at home to break their league losing streak stretching back to September. The team went on a four match winning streak from 15 February to 23 March, earning three try bonus points in the team&#x27;s longest run of wins in 11 years. Following this run of form though, Connacht failed to win another match in the league, finishing in tenth place and level on points with ninth placed Dragons. Due to Leinster&#x27;s victory in the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup, Connacht again participated in the Heineken Cup, where they were drawn into Pool 3 with Saracens, Toulouse and Zebre. In the third round of pool games Connacht produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Heineken Cup when they defeated Toulouse in the Stade Ernest-Wallon. Despite two wins against Zebre, this wasn&#x27;t enough to qualify from the pool, with the team again finishing third.

The following season brought a restructuring of games at European level, which meant Connacht returned to the second-tier competition. Connacht finished second in their pool in the 2014–15 Challenge Cup and qualified for the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by Gloucester. In the 2014–15 Pro12, Connacht enjoyed their best season since the competition changed to a round-robin format, winning a record 10 games, including home derbies against provincial rivals Leinster and Munster on their way to finishing seventh. The seventh-place finish saw Connacht entered into a play-off involving Bordeaux Bègles and Gloucester for a place in the next season&#x27;s Champions Cup. Connacht played Gloucester away for the chance to face Bordeaux, and were leading 18–25 in the final minutes of the game when a penalty gave Gloucester a try-scoring opportunity and sent the match to extra time, after which Gloucester emerged 40–32 victors.

Having lost the previous season&#x27;s play-off, Connacht were entered into 2015–16 Challenge Cup where they topped their pool, before being knocked out by Grenoble in the quarter-finals. In the 2015–16 Pro12 however, Connacht broke a number of records on their way to a second-place finish in the regular season. This put the team through to the end-of-year play-offs for the first time where they faced Glasgow Warriors in a semi-final in Galway, winning 16–11. On 28 May 2016, a 20–10 win against Leinster in the Pro12 final gave Connacht their first ever major trophy. The upset win drew comparisons with Premier League side Leicester City&#x27;s triumph in the same season.

Connacht&#x27;s Pro12 victory saw them qualify for the 2016–17 Champions Cup. They finished in third place in their pool, level on points with Toulouse in second to narrowly miss out on qualifying for the knockout stage of the competition for the first time. A serious injury crisis, which saw 21 players unavailable at the same time, contributed to the team sliding down the league table and they finished eighth in the 2016–17 Pro12. This saw the team entered into a play-off to qualify for the 2017–18 Champions Cup. A six-point loss to Northampton Saints saw Connacht entered into the Challenge Cup. This was Lam&#x27;s last game in charge. It had been announced in December 2016 that he would leave at the end of the season to take over English side Bristol.

===Post-Lam era (2017–present)===
The assistant coach of Super Rugby side the , Kieran Keane, was named as Pat Lam&#x27;s replacement in February 2017, to take over ahead the start of the 2017–18 season. However, Keane&#x27;s commitments with the Chiefs in Super Rugby kept him from linking up with Connacht fully until the end of that July. The league underwent further restructuring, with the addition of two South African teams and the division of the competition into two conferences. After a disappointing first season, in which Connacht finished second from bottom in their conference, Keane was let go one year into a three-year deal. The end of the 2017–18 season also saw the departure of long-serving player and captain John Muldoon who had made 327 appearances in his record-breaking career with the province.

Keane was replaced for the following season by Australian coach Andy Friend, who had previously been head coach of the Australian sevens team. His appointment was announced as his replacement in May 2018. Jarrad Butler, the previous season&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year, was named as Muldoon&#x27;s replacement in the captaincy. In Europe, Connacht again qualified for the Challenge Cup knockout stage and were again beaten in the quarter-finals, this time by Sale Sharks. However, Friend&#x27;s first season in charge saw a large improvement in league performance, with Connacht climbing to third place in their conference in the 2018–19 Pro14, returning the team to the top level of European competition for the following season. The third-place finish also qualified the team for the end-of-season play-offs for the first time since 2016, where they were beaten by Ulster at the quarter-final stage.

During the 2021-22 Heineken Champions Cup, Connacht advanced to the knock-out stages for the first time following the cancellation of a final round group stage match between Toulouse and Cardiff, due positive COVID-19 tests in the Toulouse squad. Following the 2021–22 season, Friend was promoted to Director of Rugby with Senior Coach Peter Wilkins assuming the role of Head Coach.

==Status within Irish rugby==
Connacht has historically been designated as being the weakest in the country compared to its fellow provinces. In the 1960s for example, the Irish team was picked by a committee of five, generally consisting of two representatives each from Leinster and Ulster, and one from Munster. Connacht were represented on this council by a sub-selector, without the power to vote on the final squad. Most of Connacht&#x27;s international players during this era were either Irish-qualified imports from England or players who joined the side after failing to make the cut in their native province. Tom Clancy, a Connacht international player, stated that players like him had to be &quot;twice as good as the competition to get a chance&quot;.

At the onset of the professional era, the IRFU designated Connacht as a development team, meaning the team received only half the budget of the other Irish provinces. In 2003, the IRFU discussed the future of Connacht Rugby and the prospect of the team being shut down as part of a cost-saving program. In response, thousands of supporters marched to show their support of the provincial team and this idea was subsequently rejected. In May 2014, the IRFU announced that it would be providing Connacht with an increase in funding of over €1 million, nominally to improve strength and conditioning coaching and facilities.

Although Connacht are no longer as far behind in funding, they do still have a smaller playing population compared to the other provinces. The Connacht Rugby academy under Nigel Carolan consistently produced graduates to represent the senior Connacht Rugby team, with many of these players having also represented Ireland at under-age level. Robbie Henshaw, Dave Heffernan, Denis Buckley, Eoin McKeon, Eoin Griffin, Darragh Leader, Tiernan O&#x27;Halloran and Jack Carty are examples of Connacht players native to the province to have progressed to the senior team through the academy.

In spite of the increased production line of native talent, Connacht continues to rely on its traditional policy of bringing in players from outside its jurisdiction that have failed to progress to their senior provincial team to help make up its playing numbers. Examples of this from the amateur era include Robbie McGrath and Victor Costello, both of whom went on to represent Ireland. This trend has continued in the professional era with the record-holder for points scored, Ian Keatley, and leading try-scorer Matt Healy both being from Dublin, while Munster-native players like Seán Cronin and Ultan Dillane have earned Ireland caps while playing for the team. Connacht has also tended to give opportunities to foreign-born players who qualify for Ireland through heritage. This relationship was codified by the IRFU in the 1980s when English-born players were mandated to represent Connacht in the Interprovincial Championship. In the amateur era, this saw the likes of Simon Geoghegan, John O&#x27;Driscoll and Jim Staples represent Connacht, while since the game has turned professional, the likes of Michael Swift, Mike McCarthy and Kieran Marmion have all reached over 100 caps for the team.

Connacht Rugby has in the past lost players it recruited and helped to develop to provincial rivals and foreign teams. For example, Connacht lost four important first team players to provincial rivals in 2011. The team&#x27;s out-half, Ian Keatley moved to Munster, while hooker Seán Cronin, tighthead prop Jamie Hagan and winger Fionn Carr all transferred to Leinster. After the loss of another first team player to Leinster was announced in 2012, this time Irish international lock Mike McCarthy, the Connacht chief executive Tom Sears accused Leinster of trying to &quot;poach&quot; Connacht players, arguing it was not in the best interests of Irish rugby.

The province also has a lower representation in top-level club competition in Ireland than its rivals, due to its lower playing population. Of the 25 senior clubs currently operating in Connacht, only Ballina, Buccaneers, Galway Corinthians, Galwegians and Sligo compete in the highest level of amateur rugby in the country, the All-Ireland League.

===European qualification===
In the early years of European competition, Connacht were automatically entered in the European Challenge Cup each year. The IRFU were allocated three places in the more prestigious Heineken Cup, and with these going to the other provinces Connacht were left with no avenue of qualification. The Interprovincial Championship in 2000 guaranteed a spot in the following 2001–02 Heineken Cup to the top two teams, with Connacht finishing in last place. However, the advent of the Celtic League in 2001 saw this guarantee removed. The 2002–03 season saw Connacht finish ahead of Leinster in their Celtic League pool and progress to the knockout rounds ahead of the eastern province, having beaten them away in Donnybrook in the only game between the sides. Despite having finished ahead of their rivals in the table, progressed further than them in the competition and beaten them in the head-to-head game, the IRFU persisted with its policy and Leinster were entered in the 2003–04 Heineken Cup as the top Irish seeds.

The 2004–05 season saw a change to this policy, as the union began to use the Celtic League table as its sole criteria for determining which Irish teams would be entered into the following season&#x27;s Heineken Cup. Connacht finished six points behind Ulster in the final standings that year, missing out again. It wasn&#x27;t until 2016 that Connacht finished in a higher league position than any of their provincial rivals again. Despite this Connacht did achieve Heineken Cup qualification from the 2011–12 season to the 2013–14 season. Ironically this was thanks to Leinster, who won three consecutive European tournaments. Leinster&#x27;s successes meant that they were automatically qualified for the following year, leaving an open Irish qualification berth which was filled by Connacht.

With the Heineken Cup being replaced by the 20-team European Rugby Champions Cup in the 2014–15 season, the Pro12 table gained a greater influence on qualification. Under the previous format, the competition provided a minimum of ten teams, with Scotland and Italy providing two teams each, and Ireland and Wales both providing three. The new system saw one place being reserved for the highest finishing Pro12 team from each of its four participating countries and three other qualifiers based solely on league position, for a total of seven teams. The other teams were entered in the new second-tier competition, the European Rugby Challenge Cup. This meant Connacht were no longer required to finish ahead of another Irish province or rely on an Irish victory in a European tournament to qualify for the top tier of European rugby. The 2015–16 season marked a major breakthrough for Connacht, as a second-place finish in the Pro12 table followed by victory in the grand final saw the team qualify for the top tier of European competition on their own steam for the first time.

The Pro14 underwent further changes to its European qualification process ahead of the 2017–18 season. In May 2017, the guaranteed places in the Champions for at least one team from each country in the league were scrapped, with the intention of having just the top seven teams qualify instead. The addition of two South African teams to the league saw further alterations, as the teams were split into two seven-team conferences. The highest three non-South African teams from each pool took the first six qualification spots, while the seventh team to qualify would be decided by a play-off between the fourth-ranked non-South African team from each conference.

==Stadium and supporters==

===Stadium===
Dexcom Stadium has been the historical home of Connacht Rugby since the late 1920s. Located on the College Road and within walking distance of the city centre, it is known as a spartan and inhospitable venue for visiting teams. It is particularly notorious for its wet and windy conditions due to its location near the Atlantic coast and Galway&#x27;s rainy climate. In addition to its use by Connacht, Dexcom Stadium is also used for greyhound racing, with the track running between the playing field and the stands. The stadium is owned by &quot;The Galway Agricultural &amp; Sports Society Ltd.&quot; who lease it to both Connacht Rugby and the Irish Greyhound Board. Due primarily to the issue of ownership, the development of Dexcom Stadium has lagged behind that of the other Irish provinces who, with the backing of the IRFU, have moved ahead with major developments of their home grounds.

Following increased support for the province in the wake of improved results, particularly the 2015–16 title-winning season, the Connacht Branch stated their intention to undertake either a large scale redevelopment of Dexcom Stadium or a move to an alternative stadium. The ultimate stated aim for the province is a stadium with a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators, that has full covering on all stands and the ability to cater for a wide variety of fans. Surveys have been taken from supporters of the team and business owners in Galway city to determine what facilities and services would be expected from a new stadium. A move to a new location would likely mean playing in a municipal stadium in Galway city, though there is a stated preference within the province&#x27;s leadership to remain at the Dexcom Stadium if possible.

====Stadium Redevelopment====

In October 2018, plans were announced for a €30 million redevelopment of Dexcom Stadium with an expansion of the capacity to 12,000, state-of-the-art training facilities for Connacht players, new areas for greyhound racing and community facilities.

=====Phase 1=====
On 9 June 2022 Connacht announced that first phase of redevelopment had commenced with full excavation of the pitch at the Dexcom Stadium underway, to allow a new artificial playing surface for the coming season. Other works in this first phase of the project will include installing a new LED floodlight system for the pitch.

=====Phase 2=====
Phase 2 of the redevelopment is soon to enter the procurement phase, leading to the construction of a modern High Performance Centre, with the construction of a new North Stand to follow thereafter.

=====Stadium Sponsorship=====

On 19/01/2024, Connacht Rugby announced a Sponsorship agreement with Dexcom Inc., a US Company and world-leader in producing and distributing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for the management of diabetes.

The contract, for 12 Years would see the Stadium referred as Dexcom Stadium for all Games and Promotion. At the same time Connacht confirmed the timelines for the redevelopment of the Stadium and building of the Connacht Rugby HPC (High Performance Centre).

===Supporters===
The official supporters&#x27; club for the province is the &quot;Connacht Clan&quot;. A voluntary organisation, it was established in 2011 and is club run by a member-elected committee. The committee is made up entirely of supporters, with the exception of one representative from the Connacht Branch, who acts as a liaison to the supporters.

The side&#x27;s mascot &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot; is used to promote the team to younger fans, appearing at schools and attending promotional events aimed at families.

==Crest and colours==

The dimidiated eagle and sword arm featured in the Connacht Rugby crest is taken from the flag of the Province of Connacht. These arms are said to have been granted to Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the reigning King of Connacht, by the Schottenkloster, or Irish monastery, that was founded in the Bavarian city of Regensburg in the 11th century.

The current kit consists of a green and black shirt, with green shorts and green socks. The traditional colours of the Connacht province and flag are white, blue and black, with no green present. Though it is potentially related to the use of Connacht&#x27;s traditional colours of white and blue by Ulster and Leinster&#x27;s teams respectively, the reasons for its presence on the Connacht Rugby kit are unknown. However the green jersey has been associated with the Connacht senior team since as early as the 1950s. Connacht&#x27;s second jerseys often use the province&#x27;s traditional colours however. The 2019–20 European kit was primarily navy.

The current official Connacht team and support staff kit supplier is Australian manufacturer BLK sport, who announced a comprehensive four-year agreement to supply the full range of apparel for all of Connacht Rugby&#x27;s representative teams and support staff in 2013. BLK continues to be the team&#x27;s kit supplier as of the 2019–20 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLK 19/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Connacht&#x27;s main shirt sponsors are international telecommunications company Genesys. The deal was extended and Intersport Elverys remained the title sponsor for the 2019–20 season. Other sponsors of the team include Bank of Ireland, Grant Thornton International and Corrib Oil.

==Connacht Eagles==
Connacht Eagles (formerly Connacht A) is the province&#x27;s second-tier side. The Eagles represented Connacht in the semi-professional British and Irish Cup. The British and Irish Cup was discontinued after the 2017–18 season and replaced with the Celtic Cup, featuring &#x27;A&#x27; teams from Irish and Welsh Pro14 teams. In addition to their cup commitments, the Eagles compete in an Irish Interprovincial series against the &#x27;A&#x27; teams from Leinster, Munster and Ulster. During the amateur era, and early in the advent of professionalism, the main Connacht team competed in the Interprovincial Championship. Since the inception of the Celtic League however, the provinces have fielded lesser teams in order to concentrate on their league and European games. The side is generally composed of senior Connacht squad players requiring gametime, academy players and All-Ireland League players called up from their clubs. The team is currently coached by academy coach Mossy Lawler.

<text>Munster Rugby () is one of the professional provincial rugby teams from the island of Ireland. They compete in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup. The team represents the IRFU&#x27;s Munster Branch, which is responsible for rugby union throughout the Irish province of Munster. The team motto is &quot;To the brave and faithful, nothing is impossible.&quot; This is derived from the motto of the MacCarthy clan – &quot;Forti et Fideli nihil difficile&quot;. Their main home ground is Thomond Park, Limerick, though some games are played at Musgrave Park, Cork.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
Munster was officially founded in 1879, at the same time as Leinster and Ulster, with Connacht being founded ten years later in 1889. The first interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster, however, were held in 1875. The founding of the Munster branch of the IRFU was intended to organise and oversee the game within the province and prevent any club bias by providing neutral selectors for the representative side. In amateur days, the four Irish provinces played against each other in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship and also played touring international sides.

Munster traditionally drew its strength from the clubs of Limerick, with the game popular in the city and widely played at all levels. Teams such as Shannon, Garryowen and Young Munster built up fierce rivalries with one another, helping push standards in the province higher as a result.

===Games against touring sides===
Munster has a great tradition of competitiveness and impassioned displays against touring sides. The first touring side to play Munster were the famous Original All Blacks led by Dave Gallaher, who lined out against Munster in the Markets Field, Limerick in November 1905. Munster were defeated that day 33–0. Throughout the years, Munster were to record a number of near-misses and last minute defeats against South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The first tangible result against a touring side was to come in 1958, when the Wallabies were held to a 3–3 draw in Thomond Park. Munster became the first Irish provincial side to defeat a major touring team when they defeated Australia 11–8 in Musgrave Park, Cork on 25 January 1967. Munster were captained that day by Tom Kiernan.

====Against New Zealand====
Munster first played the All Blacks in 1905, losing 33–0 on the occasion. They have played each other many times since then. Munster drew with New Zealand 3–3 in 1973 and, in 1978, became, at the time, the only Irish side to have beaten the All Blacks. The 12–0 victory occurred on Tuesday 31 October 1978 at Thomond Park, in front of a crowd of 12,000, though many times that number still claim to have been present, such was the occasion. Christy Cantillon scored a try with Tony Ward converting. Ward also added a drop-goal in each half. Until the national team&#x27;s victory on 5 November 2016, it was the only time an All Blacks team lost to any Irish side in the men&#x27;s game and forms part of Munster Rugby mythology. A stage play named &quot;Alone it Stands&quot; (by John Breen) and a book entitled &quot;Stand Up and Fight: When Munster Beat the All Blacks&quot; by Alan English were both based on the event. Both have been commercially successful; &quot;Alone it Stands&quot; has had several sell-out runs in Ireland and abroad and &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; was a bestseller in 2005.

The All Blacks returned to Thomond Park in November 2008 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1978 match and to celebrate the opening of the new stadium. After 76 minutes of the match, Munster were winning 16–13, but a late try from Joe Rokocoko meant the All Blacks won 18–16.

On 11 November 2016, Munster welcomed the Māori All Blacks to Thomond Park. The Māori players paid tribute to Anthony Foley by placing a jersey with his initials on the halfway line before performing the Haka. Māori captain Ash Dixon then presented the jersey to Foley&#x27;s sons. Munster went on to win the historic game 27–14.

On 3 February 2024, Munster hosted a world first &#x27;Clash of Champions&#x27; against the Crusaders, the 14-time champions of Super Rugby, at Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Munster edged out the Crusaders to win 21–19, having led 14–7 at half-time. The Crusaders were coached by Former Munster Head Coach Rob Penney.

====Against Australia====
Like the All Blacks, Munster have played Australia many times. They first met in 1947, when Australia won 6–5. Munster claimed their first victory over the Wallabies in 1967 when they won 11–8. In 1992, Australia, then-reigning world champions having won the 1991 Rugby World Cup, visited Munster as part of a European tour. Munster won 22–19 in a rough encounter in Cork. Ten years later, London newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; recounted part of the legend in a feature on Munster prop Peter Clohessy: &quot;The then Wallabies coach, Bob Dwyer, who was not a man who readily accepted that opposition sides could legitimately score more points than his team, immediately branded the Munster number 3 a &#x27;disgrace&#x27;. It had been a typically rugged, robust and memorable Munster triumph, with leather and fists flying on both sides. Clohessy, who wouldn&#x27;t generally be known for misconduct, was no more guilty than the next man but world champions are not supposed to lose against a hastily assembled Irish provincial XV. There had to be a reason, an excuse, and Dwyer rounded on Clohessy&quot;.

History repeated itself in 2010 when Munster defeated the Wallabies 15–6, with their Australian fly-half, Paul Warwick, kicking all fifteen points (three penalties and 2 drop goals). The match was played in ferocious weather, with Munster playing into a gale-force wind and driving rain in the first-half. Indeed, the conditions made the half time score of 6–6 all the more significant, as Australia could neither cope with the weather nor the Munster pressure in the second-half.

====Against South Africa====
Munster have played South Africa much less frequently than they have Australia and New Zealand. The first fixture between the two sides took place on 11 December 1951 in Thomond Park, with the visitors emerging with an 11–6 win after a late try broke the deadlock. South Africa returned to face the province for a second time on 22 December 1960, this time at Musgrave Park. They again secured a narrow win against the province, needing two late scores for a 9–3 win. The third meeting between the sides was less of a close-run thing, with South Africa easing to a 25–9 win in Thomond Park on 11 January 1970.

After the GAA Central Council unanimously backed the proposal, Munster confirmed they would face a South Africa XV in a friendly held at Cork GAA&#x27;s 45,000-capacity Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022. It was the first time Munster have faced a South African national team in the professional era and the first time a game of rugby was held at the stadium. The match was a 41,400 sell-out at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, making it the largest attendance for a rugby match in the province, and saw Munster secure their first ever win against South Africa in a 28–14 victory. Winger Shane Daly opened the scoring in just the 2nd minute, with fly-half Ben Healy converting to give the home side a 7–0 lead. South Africa hit back in the 12th minute through an Aphelele Fassi try that was converted by Johan Goosen to level the score, but Munster struck back with tries from Simon Zebo and Diarmuid Barron, both converted by Healy, to head into half-time with a 21–7. Munster struck early in the second-half, with fullback Mike Haley scoring after just two minutes and Healy&#x27;s fourth conversion of the night extending their lead to 28–7. South Africa scored their second try in the 62nd minute when Sikhumbuzo Notshe crossed the try-line, converted by Gianni Lombard, but the visitors were unable to mount a comeback and Munster hung on to earn a famous win.

===Professional era===
On 26 August 1995, the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an &quot;open&quot; game, removing all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. This was done due to a committee conclusion that having an open game was the only way to end the hypocrisy of shamateurism, and keep control of the sport. The threat to amateur rugby union was mostly prevalent in the Southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia where Super League was threatening to entice players to rugby league with large salaries. In Ireland, the four provincial teams were the only teams to go professional, while their smaller constituent clubs remained amateur.

The 1995–96 season saw the first ever Heineken Cup, a new tournament set up for European clubs. The Irish were allocated three places in the competition, with these places going to Leinster, Munster and Ulster. Munster finally reached the Heineken Cup quarter-finals in 1998–99 Heineken Cup, after three years of not being able to get out of the group stages.

===Near-misses and European glory (1999–2009)===
Munster&#x27;s first appearance in the Heineken Cup&#x27;s final was in the 1999–2000 Heineken Cup, where they lost by one point to Northampton at Twickenham. Nevertheless, the season was most memorable with a 31–25 win over Toulouse in Bordeaux.

Their good form and bad luck continued in the following season, 2000–01, with a semi-final defeat to Stade Français, again by one point, where a try from John O&#x27;Neill was disallowed by the referee, as he deemed the ball to be out over the dead-ball line. In the 2001–02 Heineken Cup, Munster lost the last match of their pool at Castres, but qualified as best runners-up. Munster beat Stade Français 16–14 in Paris, the only try of the game coming from Anthony Horgan. It was then on to Béziers to meet Castres again for the semi-final. Munster were triumphant and went to the final at Millennium Stadium to meet the reigning champions, Leicester. Munster lost a tight game remembered as &#x27;the hand of Back&#x27; final, as the Leicester flanker used his hand illegally in a scrum when Munster had a last-chance attack. Munster also reached the final of the Celtic League in this season, but lost 24–20 to Leinster at Lansdowne Road, Dublin.

In 2002–03, Munster reached the quarter-finals after a win against Gloucester, later issued on VHS under the title &quot;The Miracle Match&quot;. In this game, Munster needed to win by a margin of at least 27 points and score a minimum of four tries to earn a quarter-final berth. They won 33–6 with four tries in a game that has become part of Munster Rugby folklore. They again faced Leicester, this time at the Tigers&#x27; home of Welford Road, and defeated the reigning champions to progress to the semi-finals. They faced Toulouse in the semi-finals and lost out on a place in the final after losing by a single point in France. In this season, Munster won the Celtic League for the first time, by beating Neath-Swansea Ospreys 37–17 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.

In 2003–04 it was more of the same. After an assured performance in the pool stage, Munster defeated Stade Français at Thomond Park to set up a semi-final date with English champions, London Wasps. This match has gone down as one of the best Heineken Cup matches of all time. Although leading by 10 points in the second half, and having lost Ronan O&#x27;Gara to injury early on, they succumbed to two Wasps tries in injury time, resulting in a Wasps v Toulouse final. Munster finished in a disappointing seventh position in the 2003–04 season of the Celtic League.

In 2004–05, after a shaky performance in the pool stage, Munster qualified as 5th seeds and played Biarritz away. The match was played at Real Sociedad&#x27;s ground, the Anoeta Stadium, in San Sebastián, Spain – the first Heineken Cup game ever played in Spain. Biarritz won 19–10 to avenge a 38–29 defeat at the same stage in 2001. Munster finished second in the 2004–05 Celtic League season but won the Celtic Cup, defeating Llanelli Scarlets 27–16 in the final.

In 2005–06, Munster qualified to the final of the Heineken Cup, having overcome rivals Leinster 30–6 in the semi-final at Lansdowne Road. The final was held at the Millennium Stadium against Biarritz. Munster won 23–19 to become European Champions for the first time. Munster finished one place lower than the previous season in the Celtic League, finishing third overall.

The 2006–07 Heineken Cup was a disappointing tournament for Munster, as they lost their previously unbeaten European record at Thomond Park, losing to Leicester Tigers in the group stages in January 2007, and later lost their quarter-final to Llanelli Scarlets. Munster&#x27;s performance in the Celtic League was equally disappointing, finishing sixth overall.

In 2007, Munster signed Doug Howlett, the all-time leading try scorer for New Zealand. Howlett joined the squad after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. That season&#x27;s Heineken Cup saw Munster finish top in their group, and they went on to reach the final for the second time in three years, beating Saracens in the semi-final. The final, again held at the Millennium Stadium, saw Munster defeat Toulouse 16–13 to claim their second Heineken Cup title in 3 years. Munster finished third in the Celtic League in the 2007–08 season. In May 2008, Director of Coaching Declan Kidney left to take up the head coach job with Ireland. Munster ensured continuity by promoting Australian Tony McGahan to the position from within the coaching setup.

In the 2008–09 Heineken Cup, Munster once again topped their group and hammered Ospreys 43–9 to advance to a semi-final against arch-rivals Leinster. Many had fancied Munster to become only the second team to win back-to-back Heineken Cups, but a dominant Leinster side gained revenge for their 2006 semi-final defeat against Munster with a 25–6 win in Croke Park, in front of a then-world record 82,208 crowd. Munster clinched the Celtic League for the second time in their history, after their closest challengers Ospreys beat Dragons but failed to claim a bonus point. This handed the title to Munster who could not be overtaken at the top of the table.

===The McGahan and Penney years (2009–2014)===
The 2009–10 season saw Munster finish top of their Heineken Cup pool once again. Victories over Northampton Saints, French Top 14 champions Perpignan and Italian side Benetton saw Munster qualify for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals for a record 12th consecutive year. The match took place at Thomond Park, where Munster played Northampton Saints for the third time that season and won 33–19. They lost 18–7 in the semi-finals against Biarritz at the Anoeta. Munster came 4th in the Celtic League, but because this season saw the introduction of a play-off system for the top four teams, Munster met and lost 16–6 to Leinster in the play-off semi-final.

The 2010–11 season saw Munster drawn in pool 3 of the Heineken Cup alongside Ospreys, London Irish and Toulon. Munster lost 23–17 away to London Irish, before defeating Toulon 45–18 at Thomond Park. Munster defeated Ospreys 22–16, but lost the reverse fixture at Liberty Stadium 19–15. In round 5 Munster went to Toulon, losing 32–16. As a result, Munster failed to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup for the first time in 13 years. Munster won their final pool game, at home to London Irish, 28–14, and qualified for the 2010–11 European Challenge Cup quarter-finals. Munster defeated Leinster 24–23 on 2 April 2011 in the Celtic League, ending a run of 5 straight defeats against their provincial rivals. Munster beat Brive 42–37 in their Challenge Cup quarter-final to qualify for the semi-final against Harlequins on 30 April. Munster lost the semi-final in Thomond Park 20–12. Munster finished first in the 2010–11 Celtic League. They beat Ospreys 18–11 in their semi-final to set up a Grand Final with Leinster, which Munster won 19–9, securing a third Celtic League title.

Munster were drawn in pool one for the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, alongside Northampton Saints, Scarlets and Castres. They beat Northampton 23–21 in the first pool game at Thomond Park, after an 83rd minute drop-goal from Ronan O&#x27;Gara. In their second pool game, Munster beat Castres 24–27, with O&#x27;Gara again scoring an overtime drop-goal to secure victory. Munster won their third pool game, away to Scarlets, 17–14. In the return fixture a week later, Munster won 19–13. A 26–10 win over Castres on 14 January 2012 ensured that Munster qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup. Munster ended their 2011–12 Heineken Cup pool fixtures with a 51–36 victory against Northampton Saints, securing the top seed in the quarter-finals and winning 6 out of 6 pool matches for the first time.

Munster finished third in the 2011–12 Pro12, and played Ospreys away in the play-off semi-finals, losing 45–10. It was announced on 22 February 2012 that McGahan would be leaving Munster at the end of the 2011–12 season, to take up a role of coaching co-ordinator on Australia&#x27;s management team. Rob Penney, coach of Canterbury and New Zealand U20, was chosen to succeed McGahan, being unveiled as the next Munster coach on 2 May 2012.

Munster won the game 29–6, scoring five tries, including a hat-trick from Simon Zebo. Leicester Tigers&#x27; 9–5 victory over Toulouse ensured that Munster qualified as a second-best runner-up, and they played Harlequins in the quarter-finals. Munster won the quarter-final 18–12, advancing to the semi-finals, which they lost 16–10 to Clermont on 27 April 2013. Munster finished sixth in the 2012–13 Pro12.

It marked the third season in a row in which Munster faced Leicester and the second season in a row in which they will play Racing 92. On 30 June 2017, it was confirmed after weeks of speculation that director of rugby Rassie Erasmus and defence coach Jacques Nienaber would leave the province in December of that year.

In August 2017, Celtic Rugby Limited and the South African Rugby Union confirmed that the two South African teams that had been cut from the southern hemisphere Super Rugby competition, Cheetahs and Southern Kings, would be joining an expanded Pro14 league ahead of the 2017–18 season. Due to the addition of two new teams, the league format was changed to feature two conferences, A and B, with Munster being placed in conference A alongside Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Glasgow Warriors, Connacht, Cheetahs and Zebre Parma.

In October 2017, Munster confirmed that then-South Africa forwards coach Johann van Graan would join the province in November as their new head coach.

In the Champions Cup back-to-backs against defending champions Saracens, Munster won 10–3 at home on 7 December 2019, with the English side picking up a losing bonus point. In the return fixture one week later, Munster were beaten 15–6, with two tries in the final quarter securing the win for Saracens and denying Munster a losing bonus point.

Following an incident that triggered a large brawl in Munster&#x27;s second fixture against Saracens in December 2019 and a complaint to the EPCR from Saracens, in which Munster team doctor Jamie Kearns was accused of verbally abusing Saracens hooker Jamie George, an independent panel upheld the complaint and found that Kearns had breached the EPCR&#x27;s disciplinary rules, handing Kearns a three-week ban, suspended for 12 months, and a fine of €2,000 to be paid immediately.

Munster went into their round 5 Champions Cup clash away to Racing 92 on 12 January 2020 knowing that they had to win to keep alive their hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals of the tournament, but despite leading the French club with ten minutes to go, late tries from Racing secured a 39–22 win for the home side. Munster needed results elsewhere to go their way if they were to stand any chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals as the final round of pool matches took place, but Glasgow Warriors 45–7 win against Sale Sharks ended those hopes before Munster&#x27;s final game against Ospreys had even taken place. In the event, Munster won 33–6 against Ospreys, with Craig Casey, who made his European debut for the province in the defeat to Racing, scoring his first try for Munster, and Calvin Nash, Jack O&#x27;Sullivan and Ben Healy making their European debuts for the province.

Munster&#x27;s 68–3 win against South African side Southern Kings in round 11 of the Pro14 on 14 February 2020 was a record margin of victory for the province in the competition, and the ten tries scored also set a new record for the province. Academy member John Hodnett made his debut for Munster in the fixture, scoring a try and earning the Man-of-the-Match award. The match had an added poignancy for Munster, as their long-serving former CEO, Garrett Fitzgerald, who had only retired in June 2019, passed away following a battle with illness earlier that day.

The 2019–20 Pro14 was suspended indefinitely by tournament organisers on 12 March 2020 in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Munster&#x27;s round 14 and 15 fixtures against Italian side Benetton had already been postponed. Tyler Bleyendaal was forced to retire from playing rugby with immediate effect in May 2020 due to a persistent neck injury. In the same month, prop Brian Scott was also forced to retire with immediate effect due to injury. The regular season resumed on 22 August 2020, with the number of rounds reduced from 21 to 15 and any games postponed prior to the indefinite suspension of the season being deemed as 0–0 draws and both teams awarded two points. Rounds 14 and 15 took place as derbies in each territory, with the top two teams in each conference progressing to a semi-final stage.

Munster resumed their season on 22 August 2020 with a fixture against Leinster in the Aviva Stadium, which Leinster won 27–25. Munster handed debuts to new signings Damian de Allende and RG Snyman, though Snyman&#x27;s first appearance for the province lasted only 7 minutes after he was injured during a lineout. Andrew Conway scored tries either side of Keith Earls&#x27; try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking 10 points off the tee, and Chris Farrell won the Man-of-the-Match award.

Munster completed their reduced 15 round Pro14 regular season with a seven try 49–12 win against Connacht, a victory that secured a semi-final against defending champions and provincial rivals Leinster on 4 September 2020. The tries came from Chris Cloete, Jeremy Loughman, Tadhg Beirne, James Cronin, two from Andrew Conway and a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking all five of his conversions and Rory Scannell converting the final try. As well as getting on the scoresheet, Tadhg Beirne also won the Man-of-the-Match award on his first game back after fracturing an ankle against Saracens in December 2019. Leinster won the semi-final 13–3, knocking Munster out at the semi-final stage of the Pro14 for the third season in a row.

Munster opened their 2020–21 Pro14 season with a 30–27 away win against Scarlets on 3 October 2020. Despite nine penalties from Scarlets fullback Leigh Halfpenny and a red card for captain Peter O&#x27;Mahony, tries from Jack O&#x27;Donoghue and Chris Farrell kept Munster within touching distance of the hosts, and a try from replacement hooker Kevin O&#x27;Byrne, converted by Ben Healy, levelled the score going into the final minutes of the game, before academy fly-half Healy scored a 50-metre penalty in the 81st minute to earn what had previously looked like an unlikely win for the province.

Munster&#x27;s 2020–21 Champions Cup campaign commenced with a 21–7 home win against Harlequins on 13 December 2020, in which Gavin Coombes, Damian de Allende and Josh Wycherley made their tournament debuts. Coombes scored one try, with the other being a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan and Ben Healy adding nine points of the kicking tee between them. Munster travelled away to Clermont for round two on 19 December 2020 and, despite trailing 28–9 to the home side at one point, fought back to earn a stunning 39–31 win at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. The tries for Munster came from Mike Haley, star-of-the-match CJ Stander and Kevin O&#x27;Byrne, with JJ Hanrahan scoring a perfect nine from nine off the kicking tee for the other 24 points.

In early January 2021, the EPCR took the decision to temporarily suspend rounds 3 and 4 of the 2020–21 Champions Cup, following a directive from authorities in France that French clubs should not participate in the scheduled matches in response to health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Munster&#x27;s 20–17 win against Connacht in round 14 of the 2020–21 Pro14 on 5 March 2021 saw them become the first team to qualify for 2021 Pro14 Grand Final, as the victory gave them an unassailable 12 point lead at the top of conference B with two rounds remaining. Munster were beaten 16–6 by arch-rivals Leinster in the 2021 Pro14 Grand Final on 27 March 2021.

The Champions Cup resumed on the weekend of 2/3/4 April 2021 with the top eight teams from each pool at the time of suspension progressing to the round of 16, where Munster had home advantage thanks to their wins in the opening games against Harlequins and Clermont. Munster were drawn against Toulouse.

In an enthralling encounter at Thomond Park, Munster led 16–9 at half-time thanks to two tries from Keith Earls and two penalties from Joey Carbery, but Toulouse pulled level thanks to a converted try from Matthis Lebel. Gavin Coombes scored from close-range to give Munster the lead again, before Toulouse captain Julien Marchand responded with a try to level the scores again at 23–23. Substitute fly-half JJ Hanrahan scored a penalty to give Munster a 26–23 lead heading into the final 15 minutes of the match, but Toulouse&#x27;s talismanic scrum-half Antoine Dupont scored two tries in 9 minutes to help the French club pull away on the scoreboard. A late consolation try from Gavin Coombes, his second of the match, in overtime meant the final score was 40–33 to Toulouse, who became just the second French club to win a European match at Thomond Park and advanced to an away quarter-final against Munster&#x27;s pool opponents Clermont.

Munster opened their 2021–22 United Rugby Championship campaign with a bonus-point 42–17 win against the Sharks, one of the four new South African teams, on 25 September 2021. Simon Zebo, making his return for the province, scored two tries, extending his club record to 62, with Gavin Coombes continuing his try-scoring exploits from the previous season with two tries of his own. Chris Cloete and player of the match Craig Casey also crossed the try line. Fly-half Joey Carbery scored seven points off the kicking tee, with his replacement Ben Healy contributing five points off the tee in the second-half. RG Snyman made his eagerly-awaited return from long-term injury as a second-half replacement, and scrum-half Rowan Osborne made his competitive debut for the province, in a match that saw fans return to Thomond Park for the first time since February 2020.

Munster were in South Africa for rounds 6 and 7 of the United Rugby Championship, in which they were due to play the and the , however, the emergence of the &quot;omicron&quot; variant of COVID-19 led to travel restrictions being implemented by UK and EU authorities, meaning the fixtures had to be postponed. 34 players and staff arrived back in Ireland on 1 December 2021 and immediately entered 10 days of mandatory self-isolation. 14 players and staff who had tested positive for COVID-19 had to remain in South Africa.

In the wake of this disruption for Munster and other clubs, and with Munster&#x27;s opening Champions Cup fixture away to Wasps falling on 12 December, the EPCR extended the deadline for registering players for the tournament to 8 December, meaning Munster could look to supplement their squad with short-term signings, and 22 players were subsequently registered with the province&#x27;s Champions Cup squad.

A depleted Munster squad made up of internationals who&#x27;d been away with Ireland during the Autumn tests, academy players and members of the national and provincial talent squads travelled over to England to face Wasps on their opening Champions Cup fixture on 12 December 2021. The team, which featured 12 debutantes, pulled off one of the great Munster away victories, defeating their opponents 35–14 in a thrilling contest in front of a large contingent of Munster fans who had made the journey to Coventry.

Munster made it back-to-back wins in the Champions Cup with a gritty 19–13 win at home against French club Castres on 18 December 2021, with a 58th minute try from number 8 Jack O&#x27;Donoghue and 14 points off the tee from fly-half Ben Healy being enough for the province to see off their opposition.

In the reverse fixture against Castres in round 3 of the Champions Cup on 14 January 2022, Munster earned a 16–13 away win thanks to a 77th minute try from Gavin Coombes, converted by rookie fly-half Jack Crowley, who was faultless off the kicking tee in his first European start for the province. The win secured a place in the knockout stage of the tournament for Munster. Nine days later, Munster followed up their away win against Castres with a 45–7 home win against Wasps, with the tries coming from Jeremy Loughman, Conor Murray, Jack O&#x27;Donoghue, who was player of the match on the occasion of his 150th cap for Munster, Rory Scannell and Simon Zebo, who scored a brace to become Munster&#x27;s all-time leading try-scorer in the Champions Cup and the leading Irish try-scorer in the competition overall. Fly-half Ben Healy and his replacement on the day, Jack Crowley, were both 100% from the kicking tee, with Healy scoring four conversions and a penalty, and Crowley adding two late conversions. The win secured home advantage for Munster in the second leg of the round of 16.

Munster faced English club Exeter Chiefs in the round of 16, and lost the first leg of the tie 13–8 away to the Premiership club on 9 April 2022. Exeter took a 10–0 lead in to half-time after tries from Stuart Hogg and Jacques Vermeulen, before Munster fly-half Ben Healy hit back with a penalty to reduce the home sides lead. Hogg responded for Exeter with a drop-goal, but a 66th minute try from Shane Daly brought Munster back within touching distance on the scoreboard, and Exeter had to withstand some intense offensive play from Munster going into the final ten minutes, with replacement scrum-half Craig Casey almost drawing the scores level, before the hosts themselves assaulted the Munster try-line in the last minutes of the match in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to extend their lead.

Needing to overturn a five-point deficit to advance in the competition, Munster welcomed Exeter to Thomond Park for the second leg of their last 16 tie one week later. Fly-half Joey Carbery, returning from injury, opened the scoring for the hosts with a penalty, but the visitors responded with their first try of the game to take an early 5–3 lead, before Carbery struck back for Munster with a try of his own, to which he added a second penalty to give Munster a 13–5 half-time lead. Exeter struck first in the second-half with a try in the 47th minute, but Carbery kept Munster in front with two further penalties, before centre Damian de Allende scored a 74th minute try to secure a 26–10 home win for Munster and a 34–23 victory on aggregate, ensuring Munster progressed to a record 19th Champions Cup quarter-final.

Facing defending champions Toulouse, who knocked the province out of the previous season&#x27;s tournament, in the quarter-final, Munster began strongly with an 11th minute Alex Kendellen try, converted by Joey Carbery to lead 7–0, but Romain Ntamack hit back for Toulouse two minutes later with a try of his own, converted by Thomas Ramos, to level the scores. The visitors were dominating the scrum and scored their second try in the 25th minute when Matthis Lebel touched down, with Ramos again converting to give Toulouse a 14–7 lead. However, Munster struck back with a Keith Earls try just before half-time which Carbery converted to leave the scores level heading into the break. The home side came out firing in the second-half, with Mike Haley scoring a 43rd minute try, again converted by Carbery, to give Munster a 21–14 lead, which Carbery extended with a penalty in the 56th minute, but Toulouse responded with Lebel&#x27;s second try in the 66th minute which, when converted by Ramos, reduced the margin to just three points heading into the final ten minutes. A 75th-minute penalty from Ramos levelled the scores at 24–24, and that remained the score at full-time after Ben Healy missed with a 56-metre penalty attempt in the final minute of normal time.

With the scores level at full-time and as both teams scored three tries, extra time ensued, played over two ten-minute halves, but even after that the two teams could not be separated after three missed drop goals between the two, and the game went to a penalty shootout. Munster went first and Conor Murray scored his penalty. Antoine Dupont responded successfully for Toulouse, but Ben Healy missed his first attempt, and when Thomas Ramos scored his penalty, it was advantage Toulouse. Carbery scored his penalty, but Romain Ntamack scored his own to restore Toulouse&#x27;s lead. Murray missed with his second attempt, whilst Dupont was successful with his own to give Toulouse a 4–2 lead, meaning Healy had to score with his second attempt to give Munster any hope, but he was unable to do so, and Toulouse advanced to the semi-finals, knocking Munster out of the competition for the second season in a row.

A 35–25 defeat away to Leinster in round 18 of the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship meant that Munster finished sixth in the league overall, and third in the Irish Shield, and the province headed north to face Ulster in the quarter-finals on 3 June 2022, but Munster lost 36–17 to bring the curtain down on their 2021–22 season, as well as Johann van Graan&#x27;s tenure as head coach.

===Graham Rowntree becomes head coach===
Head coach Johann van Graan, who joined Munster in November 2017, confirmed in December 2021 that he would be leaving the province at the end of the 2021–22 season to join English club Bath. In addition to this, senior coach Stephen Larkham also left the province to return home to Australia to become head coach of the Brumbies, and defence coach JP Ferreira followed van Graan to join Bath. However, forwards coach Graham Rowntree extended his stay with the province by a further two years, and the province confirmed in April 2022 that Rowntree would be promoted to head coach from the 2022–23 season. Mike Prendergast, a former scrum-half for the province, joined Rowntree&#x27;s coaching setup as the attack coach on a three-year contract, having most recently fulfilled a similar role for French club Racing 92. Andi Kyriacou, who had joined the province in April 2021 as an elite player development officer with the academy, was promoted to forwards coach with the senior squad on a two-year contract, and former Munster player Denis Leamy returned to the province as defence coach on a three-year contract.

After a poor start to the season, Munster won the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship after beating defending champions the Stormers 19–14 away from home in the final on 27 May 2023. In doing so, Munster ended a trophy drought that had lasted since their previous league title during the 2010–11 season, and secured the first silverware of Graham Rowntree&#x27;s reign as head coach.

==Honours==
==Colours and crest==
The &#x27;three crowns&#x27; flag of Munster Rugby derives from the historic coat of arms of Munster, which reputedly alludes to the three constituent historic kingdoms of Munster; Thomond in the north, Desmond in the south, and Ormond in the east.

A revamped logo was introduced for the 2003–04 season which included the addition of a stag with the three crowns. The new crest was designed by the Limerick graphic design and branding agency &quot;Designer&#x27;s Ink&quot;, who received a Gold Award in the Irish Design Effectiveness Awards for the branding and implementation of Munster Rugby. The crest was designed to maintain the three crowns and the new red stag symbolises strength and competitiveness. The decision for change was a product of two years of planning of research and design.

Munster&#x27;s kit is made by Adidas, who replaced Canterbury in 2007 in a deal initially covering kit supply for three seasons. Between 2004 and 2013, Toyota was Munster&#x27;s primary sponsor, appearing on the front of their jersey. On 23 May 2013, it was announced on that Bank of Ireland would be replacing Toyota as Munster&#x27;s sponsor. In April 2017, the deal with Bank of Ireland was extended until the end of the 2022–23 season. In August 2017, Munster announced that Shannon Airport had become its &#x27;official airport partner&#x27; in a three-year deal, which would see the Shannon Airport logo appear on the players&#x27; shorts from the 2017–18 season onwards. The deals with kit manufacturer Adidas and retail partner LifeStyle Sports were extended in July 2019 until the end of the 2025–26 season.

==Home grounds==
Munster have two main stadia where they play their home matches – Thomond Park in Limerick and Musgrave Park in Cork. Thomond Park is the bigger of the two, with a capacity of 25,600, which can be expanded up to 26,267 with temporary seating, while Musgrave Park holds 8,800. As well as Munster, Shannon and UL Bohemians play at the grounds of Thomond Park. Thomond Park is famous for its atmosphere and unique history – its noise during play and complete silence when a player (home or away) is kicking at goal. It was also famous for Munster&#x27;s intimidating record that it held for over a decade – having never been beaten at home during the Heineken Cup. However, the record was broken during the 2006–07 season when they were defeated by Leicester Tigers. Munster train in the University of Limerick.

Thomond Park went through a major renovation in 1999 and in 2006, Munster announced plans to upgrade it. In autumn 2008, the new 25,600 capacity stadium was opened. Two sweeping arches are one of the defining features of the stadium, as well as the concourse outside of the new East Stand. The new stadium design was well received and won the Public Choice Award for 2009 from the Irish Architecture Foundation. A long discussion and consultation on the new name concluded with the decision that the name would remain &quot;Thomond Park&quot;.

==Supporters==
The Munster Rugby Supporters Club was founded in 1999 and has branches in Brussels, Dublin, London and the United States. The strength of Munster&#x27;s support was demonstrated during Munster&#x27;s 2006 and 2008 Heineken Cup final wins. News reports detailed the lengths that fans were willing to go to secure tickets to the game, with some Munster fans travelling to Biarritz to buy up the French allocation of tickets. On the day of the game the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was filled with a capacity crowd of 74,500. Of those numbers it is estimated that somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000 were Munster fans with the remainder being neutrals and Biarritz supporters. The Millennium Stadium was intended to be a neutral venue but commentators on the day remarked that it could hardly be counted as such.

Munster played in the most attended semi-final match of the Heineken Cup. 82,208 spectators attended their 2008–09 Heineken Cup semi-final against Irish rivals Leinster, which was played in Croke Park, Dublin. This was also, at the time, the largest crowd ever at a club rugby union match. The record was broken in a league game between English sides Saracens and Harlequins in 2012.

Munster&#x27;s appearance in the 2002 final of the Heineken Cup against Leicester Tigers at the Millennium Stadium, which drew 74,600, was the record attendance for a final in the competition until the 2007 Heineken Cup final between Leicester and London Wasps at the newly expanded Twickenham. Munster&#x27;s 2005 quarter-final against Biarritz Olympique in Estadio Anoeta, played across the border in Spain in San Sebastián set the record for the biggest rugby match ever played in Spain with an attendance of 32,000. Their October 2006 Celtic League game against Leinster at Lansdowne Road beat the record for that competition with an attendance of 27,252. This record lasted just two months however, with the Leinster and Ulster match on 31 December 2006 filling Lansdowne Road (over 48,000 in attendance) for the last match at the stadium before redevelopment.

On 2 October 2010, Munster played Leinster in the round 5 of the Celtic League at the Aviva Stadium, this set a new crowd attendance record for a Celtic League game at 50,645. On 26 December 2017, a new attendance record for Thomond Park in the Pro14 was set when 26,267 were at the Munster v Leinster fixture.

Munster fans are known for their silence when a kick is being taken, but also for their noise. Fans repeatedly chant &quot;MUNSTER&quot; or sing &quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot; (an Irish famine song from Galway, Connacht) and &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (from the Broadway musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;). They sang &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot; to the Ospreys&#x27; Irish winger Tommy Bowe during their 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final encounter. Tommy Bowe sang this song at the official reception for the 2009 Grand Slam winning Ireland rugby team. Munster Rugby has given the word &quot;Garryowen&quot; to the rugby lexicon. The Limerick club of Garryowen introduced the &quot;Garryowen kick&quot;, a high up-and-under which puts defending players under pressure. Shortly after the 2018 death of Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, lead singer of The Cranberries (a band formed in Limerick), Munster fans adopted the band&#x27;s song &quot;Zombie&quot; as an unofficial anthem. The song&#x27;s status was further cemented during the 2021–22 season, with the hit single featuring prominently in Munster&#x27;s defeat against Toulouse in May 2022 and in their win against a South Africa XV in Páirc Uí Chaoimh in November 2022.

==Munster A==

Munster A is the team that represents Munster in the Celtic Cup and in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Pre-professionalism and a formal league structure, the main Munster team competed in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Since the advent of professionalism, the provinces have fielded lesser teams in order to concentrate on the league. The team is composed of senior Munster squad players requiring gametime, academy players and All-Ireland League players called up from their club.

Having been beaten finalists in the 2009–10 British and Irish Cup, losing 23–14 to Cornish Pirates, Munster A secured success in the British and Irish Cup on 27 April 2012, beating Cross Keys 31–12 in the final of the 2011–12 tournament at Musgrave Park. On 21 April 2017, Munster A won their second British and Irish Cup, beating English RFU Championship side Jersey Reds 29–28 in the 2016–17 final, which was held in Musgrave Park. At one point during the first half, Munster A had been losing 18–0, but fought back to secure victory.

With 2017–18 being the last season in which the British and Irish Cup was held, the Welsh Rugby Union and Irish Rugby Football Union formed a new tournament, the Celtic Cup, which features development squads from the four Irish provinces and four Welsh regions, split into two pools of four. The first tournament ran over seven consecutive weeks between 7 September 2018 and 21 October 2018.

<doc id="985955" wikidata="Q6772867" url="?curid=985955" title="Marriage in Canada">
<text>The Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over marriage and divorce in Canada under section 91(26) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. However, section 92(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the provincial legislatures the power to pass laws regulating the solemnization of marriage.

The marriage rate in Canada has been declining over the years. In 2001, there were 146,618 marriages in Canada, down 6.8% from 157,395 in 2000, but by 2020, there were only 98,355 marriages registered in Canada, which was the lowest total since 1938. Prince Edward Island had the highest crude marriage rate (6.5 per 1,000 people) and Quebec had the lowest (3.0).

Marriage ceremonies in Canada can be either civil or religious. Marriages may be performed by members of the clergy, marriage commissioners, judges, justices of the peace or clerks of the court, depending on the laws of each province and territory regulating marriage solemnization. In 2001, the majority of Canadian marriages (76.4%) were religious, with the remainder (23.6%) being performed by non-clergy.

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Canada nationally since 2005. Court decisions, starting in 2003, had already legalized same-sex marriage in eight out of ten provinces and one of three territories.

==Marriage restrictions==

===Consanguinity===
The federal &quot;Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act&quot;, Section 2 prevents the following persons from getting married:

#Subject to subsection (2), persons related by consanguinity, affinity or adoption are not prohibited from marrying each other by reason only of their relationship.
#No person shall marry another person if they are related lineally, or as brother or sister or half-brother or half-sister, including by adoption.

===Consent of the spouses===
Both parties must freely consent. Forcing somebody to get married is a criminal offence under s. 293.1 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. In addition, s. 2.1 of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; stipulates, &quot;Marriage requires the free and enlightened consent of two persons to be the spouse of each other.&quot;

===Age of the spouses===
Since 2015, federal law has set the absolute minimum marriageable age at 16. Provinces and territories may set a minimum age higher than that. In Canada the age of majority is set by province/territory at 18 or 19, so persons under this age have additional restrictions (i.e. parental and court consent). Section 293.2 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; also addresses marriages of individuals under the age of 16, reading: &quot;Everyone who celebrates, aids or participates in a marriage rite or ceremony knowing that one of the persons being married is under the age of 16 years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.&quot; Section 2.2 of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; also states: &quot;No person who is under the age of 16 years may contract marriage.&quot; These provisions were enacted in 2015. Before 2015, it was possible for children less than 16 years old to get married in some jurisdictions of Canada, with parental consent or a court order. (The legal marriage age with parental consent was possibly as low as 7 in some Canadian jurisdictions.)

==== Minimum age by province and territory ====

* British Columbia: 19, or 16 with parental consent.
* Alberta: 18, or 16 with consent of all parents and legal guardians.
* Saskatchewan: 18, or 16 with a &quot;Consent to Marriage of a Minor&quot; form signed and completed by the parent(s) or guardian(s) in the presence of a Saskatchewan marriage licence issuer, clergy or any person authorized to take affidavits. &quot;If the parent(s) or guardian(s) refuse to consent to the marriage, the minor can apply to a judge of either the provincial or Queen&#x27;s Bench court for an order dispensing with their consent. The minor may obtain the judge&#x27;s order by applying to a court house in Saskatchewan.&quot;
* Manitoba: 18, or 16 (with judicial consent).
* Ontario: 18, or 16 with written consent from both sets of parents.
* Quebec: 18, or 16 with authorization from the courts.
* New Brunswick: 18, or 16 with an affidavit of consent signed by parents or guardians.
* Nova Scotia: 19, or 16 with a signed consent form.
* Prince Edward Island: 18, or 16 with a consent form signed by parent(s).
* Newfoundland and Labrador: 19, or younger wherein &quot;special consents may be required.&quot;
* Yukon: 19, or younger with consent of parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
* Northwest Territories: 19, or younger with parental consent.
* Nunavut: 19, or 16 with parental consent.

==Divorce==
Termination of marriage in Canada is covered by the federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot;.

A divorce may be granted for one of the following reasons:
* the marriage has irretrievably broken down, and the two parties have been living apart for a year (s.8(2)(a) of the &quot;Act&quot;)
* one party has committed adultery (s.8(2)(b)(i) of the &quot;Act&quot;)
* one party has treated the other party &quot;with physical or mental cruelty of such a kind as to render intolerable the continued cohabitation of the spouses&quot; (s.8(2)(b)(ii) of the &quot;Act&quot;)

Key headings of the &quot;Divorce Act&quot;:

*Interpretation
*Jurisdiction
*Divorce
*Child support orders
*Spousal support orders
*Priority
*Custody orders
*Variation, rescission or suspension of orders
*Provisional orders
*Appeals
*General

==Polygamy==

In Canada, polygamy is a criminal offence, but prosecutions are rare. In March 2014, Winston Blackmore and James Oler were charged with polygamy; their prosecutions were the first such cases in Canada in over sixty-five years. In 2007, an independent prosecutor in British Columbia recommended that Canadian courts be asked to rule on the constitutionality of laws against polygamy. The Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld Canada&#x27;s polygamy laws in a 2011 reference case.

On March 9, 2018, the Supreme Court of British Columbia reaffirmed the constitutionality of Canada&#x27;s anti-polygamy laws, upholding the July 2017 polygamy convictions of Winston Blackmore and James Oler.

<text>Lifelong learning is the &quot;ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated&quot; pursuit of learning for either personal or professional reasons. 

Lifelong learning is important for an individual&#x27;s competitiveness and employability, but also enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development.

Professions typically recognize the importance of developing practitioners becoming lifelong learners. Many licensed professions mandate that their members continue learning to maintain a license. 

Lifelong learning institutes are educational organisations specifically for lifelong learning purposes. Informal lifelong learning communities also exist around the world.

== History ==
In some contexts, the term &quot;lifelong learning&quot; evolved from the term &quot;life-long learners&quot;, created by Leslie Watkins and used by Clint Taylor, professor at CSULA and Superintendent for the Temple City Unified School District, in the district&#x27;s mission statement in 1993, the term recognizes that learning is not confined to childhood or the classroom but takes place throughout life and in a range of situations.

In other contexts, the term &quot;lifelong learning&quot; evolved organically. The first lifelong learning institute began at The New School for Social Research (now The New School) in 1962 as an experiment in &quot;learning in retirement&quot;. Later, after similar groups formed across the United States, many chose the name &quot;lifelong learning institute&quot; to be inclusive of nonretired persons in the same age range.

Traditional colleges and universities are beginning to recognize the value of lifelong learning outside of the credit and degree attainment model. Lifelong learners, including persons with academic or professional credentials, tend to find higher-paying occupations, leaving monetary, cultural, and entrepreneurial impressions on communities, according to educator Cassandra B. Whyte.

=== Libraries in the United States ===
In the United States, librarians have understood lifelong learning as an essential service of libraries since the early part of the 20th century. In 1924, William S. Learned, wrote of the potential of the American public library as an agency for adult education in &quot;The American Public Library and the Diffusion of Knowledge&quot;. Two decades later, in 1942, the American Library Association Adult Education Board established a new responsibility to the adult reader.

The Adult Education Act of 1966 linked literacy education and adult basic education programs. This occurred at the same time that the Library Services and Construction Act was being passed. Twenty-five years after the U.S. Adult Education Act was passed, the U.S. Office of Education published &quot;Partners for Lifelong Learning, Public Libraries and Adult Education&quot;.

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) was established in 1996 and incorporated responsibilities from the U.S. Office of Education&#x27;s library programs, including those focused on lifelong learning. &quot;Championing Lifelong Learning&quot; through libraries and museums is the first goal listed in the organization&#x27;s strategic plan for 2022-2026.

== Definition ==
Lifelong learning has been defined as &quot;all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective&quot;. It is often considered learning that occurs after the formal education years of childhood and into adulthood. It is sought out naturally through life experiences as the learner seeks to gain knowledge for professional or personal reasons. These natural experiences can come about on purpose or accidentally.

Lifelong learning has been described as a process that includes people learning in different contexts. These environments do not only include schools but also homes, workplaces, and locations where people pursue leisure activities. However, while the learning process can be applied to learners of all ages, there is a focus on adults who are returning to organized learning. There are programs based on its framework that address the different needs of learners, such as United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goal 4 and the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning, which caters to the needs of the disadvantaged and marginalized learners.

Lifelong learning is distinguished from the concept of continuing education in the sense that it has a broader scope. Unlike the latter, which is oriented towards adult education developed for the needs of schools and industries, this type of learning is concerned with the development of human potential in individuals generally.

== Pedagogy ==
Lifelong learning focuses on holistic education and it has two dimensions, namely, lifelong and broad options for learning. These indicate learning that integrates traditional education proposals and modern learning opportunities. It also entails an emphasis on encouraging people to learn how to learn and to select content, process, and methodologies that pursue autodidacticism. Some authors highlight that lifelong learning is founded on a different conceptualization of knowledge and its acquisition. It is explained not only as the possession of discrete pieces of information or factual knowledge but also as a generalized scheme of making sense of new events, including the use of tactics in order to effectively deal with them.

Reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more self-reliant through learning how to learn, thus making them better able to direct, manage, and control their own learning process. Sipe studied experimentally &quot;open&quot; teachers and found that they valued self-directed learning, collaboration, reflection, and challenge; risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity, not a threat. Dunlap and Grabinger say that for higher education students to be lifelong learners, they must develop a capacity for self-direction, metacognition awareness, and a disposition toward learning.

The Delors Report proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key paradigms: lifelong learning and the four pillars of learning. It argued that formal education tends to emphasize the acquisition of knowledge to the detriment of other types of learning essential to sustaining human development, stressing the need to think of learning over the lifespan, and to address how everyone can develop relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes for work, citizenship and personal fulfillment. The four pillars of learning are:
# Learning to know
# Learning to do
# Learning to be
# Learning to live together
The four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of &#x27;lifelong learning&#x27;, itself an adaptation of the concept of &#x27;lifelong education&#x27; as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication &quot;Learning to Be&quot;.

=== Educational technology ===
The emergence of internet technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors, allowing for informal day-to-day learning.

==Application==
In India and elsewhere, the &quot;University of the Third Age&quot; (U3A) is an almost spontaneous movement comprising autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience. 

In Sweden, the concept of study circles, an idea launched almost a century ago, still represents a large portion of the adult education provision. The concept has since spread, and for instance, is a common practice in Finland as well. 

Formal administrative units devoted to lifelong learning exist in a number of universities. For example, the &#x27;Academy of Lifelong Learning&#x27; is an administrative unit at the University of Delaware. Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego), which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning (open learning, organizational learning, community learning).

In recent years, &#x27;lifelong learning&#x27; has been adopted in the UK as an umbrella term for post-compulsory education that falls outside of the UK higher education system—further education, community education, work-based learning and similar voluntary, public sector and commercial settings.

In Canada, the federal government&#x27;s Lifelong Learning Plan allows Canadian residents to withdraw funds from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to help pay for lifelong learning, but the funds can only be used for formal learning programs at designated educational institutions.

Priorities for lifelong and lifewide learning have different priorities in different countries, some placing more emphasis on economic development and some on social development. For example, the policies of China, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Malaysia promote lifelong learning in a human resource development perspective. The governments of these countries have done much to foster training and development whilst encouraging entrepreneurship.

=== Aging ===
In a 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Arthur Toga, a professor of neurology and director of the laboratory of neuroimaging at the University of California, Los Angeles, stated that &quot;Exercising the brain may preserve it, forestalling mental decline.&quot; Some research has shown that people with higher cognitive reserves, attained through lifelong learning, were better able to avoid the cognitive decline that often accompanies age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Even when subjects had dementia, some studies show that they were able to persist in a normal mental state for a longer period than subjects who were not involved in some type of lifelong learning. 

Studies so far have lacked large, randomized controlled trials. In &quot;Education and Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease: A Review of Recent International Epidemiological Studies&quot; published in 1997 in the journal &quot;Aging and Mental Health&quot;, C.J. Gilleard, finds fault with other studies linking education to cognitive decline. Among other factors, he suggests that variations in lifestyles could be responsible for an increase in vascular dementia, as blue-collar type workers may be less inclined to work in industries that provide mentally challenging situations.

<doc id="985961" wikidata="Q1473374" url="?curid=985961" title="Leinster Rugby">
<text>Leinster Rugby () is one of the four professional provincial club rugby union teams from the island of Ireland. They compete in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup. The team represents the Leinster Branch, one of the four provincial unions that together make up the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), but is not restricted to players from that province.

Leinster play their home games primarily at the 18,500-capacity RDS Arena (&#x27;the RDS&#x27;) in Dublin, although larger games are played in the 51,700-capacity Aviva Stadium when the capacity of the RDS is insufficient, or during 2024 and 2025 to accommodate venue improvements at the RDS, with occasional on-off games been moved to Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association and by some distance the largest stadium in Ireland. Before moving to the RDS in 2005, Leinster&#x27;s traditional home ground was Donnybrook Stadium, in Dublin 4. The province plays primarily in blue with white or yellow trim and the team crest features a harp within a rugby ball, the harp being an ancient symbol of the province found in and taken from the flag of Leinster, although the traditional colours of Leinster Rugby mean the design more resembles the flag of the president of Ireland or the coat of arms of Ireland.

Leinster turned professional along with its fellow Irish provinces in 1995 and has competed in the United Rugby Championship (formerly known as the Celtic League, Magners League and the Pro12 / Pro14) since it was founded in 2001. Before 1995, the Leinster Branch had previously competed in the annual Irish interprovincial championship.

During their professional history, Leinster have been the most successful team in Ireland or from the Celtic League and its successors. As of 2024, Leinster have won their domestic title on eight occasions, while topping the regular season table a further five times, and have won as of 2025 all four URC Irish Shields. In Europe, Leinster are second only to Toulouse with four European Champions Cups, one EPRC Challenge Cup and four runners-up placings in the Champions Cup.

Leinster enjoy historical rivalries with all three provincial unions, most notably with Munster, where some games between the teams have been watched by over 80,000 fans in Croke Park. In addition, Leinster have notable rivalries with two French club teams; erstwhile rivals Toulouse with whom they have jockeyed for the title of Europe&#x27;s most decorated team, and La Rochelle, a frequent opponent in European competition who defeated Leinster in back to back European Champions Cup finals in 2022 and 2023 under the direction of long-time Munster player Ronan O&#x27;Gara.

==History==

===Founding (1879–1899)===
The Leinster Branch was inaugurated at a meeting on 31 October 1879. The meeting was held at Lawrence&#x27;s premises at 63 Grafton Street and was largely attended. Although this was the formal founding of Leinster as we know it today, with the amalgamation of the Irish Football Union and the Northern Union, the Leinster provincial team had been active since 1879 – when the first interprovincial derby was played against Ulster. The Leinster and Ulster teams also made up the representative Irish team that competed against England in Ireland&#x27;s first-ever international in 1875. Upon the founding of the union, Munster were also added to the fray in 1879, when their first provincial team was selected and first Munster players represented Ireland.

F. Kennedy (Wanderers) was elected first Hon. Secretary of the Branch and C.B. Crocker (Lansdowne) first Hon. Treasurer.

The function of the Branch was to organise the game of rugby football in the province. Every year five representatives would be selected to join the IRFU Committee. They would be known as the &quot;Leinster Five&quot; and would pick the Leinster representative teams.

The first Interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster were held in 1875. At this time the matches were played with 20 players a side. Leinster lost to Ulster by a converted try and beat Munster by one goal to nil. Since then there has been a match between these teams annually, with Connacht joining the fold in 1885.

Leinster Schools Interprovincial matches have been taking place since 1888. Leinster Schools beat the Ulster Schools in Belfast on Saturday 7 April by a dropped goal to a try. Their first match against Munster Schools took place on 18 March 1899, when Leinster won by two tries to one.

===Amateur period (1900–1990s)===
The early 1920s led to the creation of the Provincial Towns Cup and the Metropolitan Cup, which are still hard-fought competitions in the Leinster Rugby calendar. Much has changed in rugby over the years, but the original idea of Leinster Club Rugby acting as a feeder for the Leinster Interprovincial side, though now professional, still stands true.

All Interprovincial matches were abandoned during the years of the Great War (1914–1918) and the War period (1939–1945), though unofficial matches were played.

The first major touring side to play Leinster was a team drawn from the New Zealand Army – the Kiwis, in 1946. Although it was not an official touring side organised by the New Zealand Rugby Union, the quality of the match, which was drawn 10 points each, is still remembered to this day.

The first official overseas touring side that came to play Leinster was an Australian touring side in 1957. Since then, Leinster has played against every major touring side from Fiji to France.

Before the days of professional rugby union, there was further emphasis on Irish club rugby as opposed to the provincial game. During these times the provincial sides were purely representative sides and games were far less frequent than now. Between 1946 and 2002 the sides would meet annually to contest the Irish Interprovincial Championship and on rare occasions would be tested against touring international sides. When rugby union was declared &#x27;open&#x27; in 1995, these four teams became the four professional teams run by the Irish Rugby Football Union and therefore much of the history of the side has been made in the modern era.

===Leinster Lions (1990s–2005)===

Leinster became a professional outfit in the mid-1990s. The &quot;Leinster Lions&quot; name came into existence during the 2001–02 season as the result of a joint marketing initiative between Leinster Rugby and its kit sponsors, the Canterbury Clothing Company. Before the start of the 2004–05 season, the &#x27;Lions&#x27; was dropped from the name. It is still used for marketing and branding, in particular, the Cubs Club for Junior members of Leinster Rugby. The Leinster mascot is &quot;Leo the Lion&quot;. It was also during this time that the song “Molly Malone” became a match fixture to be sung by the fans.

Leinster&#x27;s first season in the newly formed Celtic League ended in success as the Lions were crowned the inaugural champions, beating rivals Munster Rugby in the 2001–02 final. In 2002–03, they became only the third team in the history of the European Cup to win all their games in pool play. They also went one step further in the playoffs than the previous season by reaching the semi-finals (for the first time since 1995–96), but lost at home against French side Perpignan, which was accompanied by an unsuccessful season in the Celtic League. The 2003–04 season also ended in disappointment as Leinster slumped to their worst ever league performance and failed to qualify from their European Cup group.

===Title misses (2004–2007)===
Leinster improved during the 2004–05 season, finishing 3rd, just three points behind the eventual winners, the Ospreys. Leinster also won all of their pool games in that year&#x27;s European Cup, and were again among the favourites for the title, however they went out at the quarter final stage to Leicester Tigers.

The next two seasons of the Celtic League were to end in near misses for Leinster, as they lost out on the 2005–06 and 2006–07 league titles on the final day of the season. These seasons also saw progress in the European Cup. In 2005–06, Leinster progressed to the semi-final but were eliminated by Irish rivals Munster at Lansdowne Road and they reached the quarter-final the following year where they were beaten by eventual winners London Wasps.

=== European and domestic dominance (2008–2014) ===
Increasing attendances at Leinster games led to a move across Dublin 4 from Donnybrook Stadium to the redeveloped RDS Arena.

In 2007–08, Leinster failed to qualify from their European Cup pool, but did end the season as Celtic League champions, sealing the title with a 41–8 victory over the Newport Gwent Dragons in front of their home fans at the RDS.

In the 2008–09 season, Leinster topped their European Cup pool despite away losses to French side Castres and English side Wasps. Victory over Harlequins in the quarter-finals followed, despite the Bloodgate Scandal. Leinster overcame Munster 25–6 in a semi-final in Dublin&#x27;s Croke Park that broke the world record attendance for a club rugby union game with a crowd of over 82,200. Leinster won the 2009 European Cup Final in Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, beating Leicester Tigers 19–16 to claim their first European crown.
In 2009–10 Leinster was eliminated from the European Cup at the semi-final stage by eventual winners Toulouse. Also despite having topped the Pro12 league during the regular season, Leinster lost the first-ever Play-off Final 17–12 on their home ground to the Ospreys.

In the 2010–11 European Cup, Leinster defeated the top English teams (Leicester Tigers, Saracens &amp; Northampton Saints), as well as top French sides, Toulouse (who were the defending European champions), Racing Metro &amp; Clermont Auvergne, (the French Champions). to go on to regain their title as champions of Europe in the 2011 European Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Trailing at half time, Leinster scored 27 unanswered points in the second half to beat Northampton 33–22 and claim their second European crown with the biggest comeback in European Cup final history.
Leinster were also chasing a Pro12 &amp; European Cup double, but lost 19–9 to Irish rivals Munster in the Pro12 Final.

In 2011–12 Leinster became only the second side ever to retain the title of European Champions. Leinster emerged unbeaten in group play to top their group and went on to defeat the Cardiff Blues 34–3 in the quarterfinals, followed by a 19–15 semifinal victory over ASM Clermont Auvergne. and defeated Ulster in the first all-Irish final 42–14, recording the most points scored and the most tries scored in a European Cup final as well as becoming the first unbeaten side to win the European Cup.
Once again, Leinster targeted the double, and faced a repeat of the 2010 Pro12 final against the Ospreys. Leinster&#x27;s domestic title challenge fell at the final hurdle, conceding a final minute try to slump to a one-point defeat, and unable to complete the double despite topping the table in the regular season.

The 2012–13 campaign proved to be another successful season for Leinster Rugby. The club finished in second place during the regular season of the Pro12 and defeated Glasgow Warriors by a score of 17–15 in their semi-final play-off match on 11 May 2013. On 17 May, Leinster were crowned champions of the European Challenge Cup after defeating Stade Français 34–13 in the final at their home ground, the RDS Arena. Leinster successfully completed the double on 25 May, defeating Ulster 24–18 in the Pro12 final to claim their third league championship.

Leinster continued their success in the 2013–14 season by becoming the first team ever to defend the Pro12 title, topping the league in the regular season and defeating Glasgow Warriors 34–12 in their fifth consecutive Pro12 play-off final and also secured their seventh major title in as many years.

=== Blooding a new generation (2015–2017) ===
Following a remarkable run of seven major trophies in seven years, Leinster&#x27;s title run came to an end following the 2013–14 season. The 2014–15 season saw a dip in form, with Leinster finishing in fifth place in the league and failing to make the play-offs. Fortunes in the newly formed Champions Cup were better, with the team reaching the semi-final where they were defeated in extra-time by eventual winners, Toulon. At the end of the season, head coach Matt O&#x27;Connor left the club by mutual consent with former club captain, Leo Cullen, being named as his replacement. Cullen then brought in ex-England coach Stuart Lancaster as senior coach at the start of the 2016–17 season, which saw a huge improvement from Leinster as well a big group of young players coming through. Despite playing brilliant rugby all season, Leinster failed to win any silverware, falling short in the Champions Cup semi-final to old rivals Clermont and shocked by the Scarlets in the Pro12 Semi-Final at the RDS. However, there was huge optimism amongst the players and supporters as they believed this was only the start of a new generation and perhaps another era of success.

=== Present Day (2018–2024) ===
Starting with the 2017–18 season, Leinster won four straight Pro14 championships. In Europe, they won the 2017-18 Heineken Cup, defeating Racing 92 by a score of 15–12 in the final in Bilbao. They were runners-ups four times in 2018-19 Heineken Cup, 2021-22 Heineken Cup, 2022-23 Heineken Cup and the 2023-24 Heineken Cup. Leinster were knocked out of the Heineken cup competition in the quarter-finals in 2019–20, and again at the semi-finals stage in 2020–21.

The format of the 2021–22 competition was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leinster won their first round matchup with Bath. However, the day prior to Leinster&#x27;s second match, an away fixture to Montpellier, the EPCR announced that the match would not go ahead, and instead awarded a 28–0 win to Montpellier. This was despite Leinster having a full squad certified to be COVID-free, named, and ready to travel. The following day, the EPCR announced that all other matches involving French and UK teams from the same second round would be postponed to a future date. Following the EPCR&#x27;s decision to award Montpellier a 28–0 bonus-point win for their cancelled round two clash, Leinster beat Montpellier by 89–7, with the 82 point margin eclipsing their previous biggest win in Europe set against Bourgoin back in 2004.

==Colours and crest==
The current crest was introduced in 2005 as Leinster Rugby held no copyright on the previous crest. The new, stylised crest, is made specific to Leinster Rugby as it incorporates the harp with a rugby ball. The Leinster Rugby crest is on all official club merchandise including replica jerseys.

The province&#x27;s current kit (2018/19) is blue with a pattern of spearheads on the jersey which takes inspiration from the people of Laighean (the ancient Irish name for Leinster), while the alternative kit is green with gold features, the colours seen in the Flag of Leinster, with a pattern of geographical cutouts for its 12 counties. The European kit is &#x27;night navy&#x27; with the name of each of the 12 counties visible on the jersey written in the ancient Irish alphabet ogham.

The Leinster jersey also features four stars above the crest, to represent the four European Cup titles won to date.

==Stadia==

===RDS Arena===

Leinster&#x27;s current home ground is the RDS Arena. Games were first played at the RDS during the 2006–07 season, initially just for European Cup games. By the following season, however, all games had been moved to the RDS. The RDS has undergone large scale redevelopment since Leinster moved in. The arena now has a mostly seated capacity of 18,500. As the RDS remains a showjumping venue, the North and South stands are removable. A roof has been constructed to cover the grandstand opposite the pre-existing Anglesea stand. The RDS will be Leinster&#x27;s home until 2027, as a 20-year lease was signed in 2007.

In July 2014, it was announced by the RDS and Leinster rugby that a design competition was being held to develop the arena into a 25,000 capacity world-class stadium, with work expected to commence on the redevelopment in April 2016. The selling of naming rights to the arena will be a key component in funding the project, with an initial budget of €20,000,000 being proposed.

===Aviva Stadium===

For bigger games where the RDS does not have sufficient capacity, Leinster play their games at the Aviva Stadium, which has an all-seater capacity of 51,700. These are often key home games in the European Cup or United Rugby Championship games against domestic rivals. In 2010 they first played a home league game against Munster, the first time the stadium sold out, and then against ASM Clermont Auvergne. Leinster defeated Leicester Tigers at the venue in the 2010–11 European Cup quarter-finals and went on to beat Toulouse in the semi-finals, also held at the Aviva stadium on 30 April 2011, en route to winning their second European Cup. The following season Leinster hosted Munster, Bath and Cardiff at the Aviva Stadium and remained unbeaten at the ground until December 2012 when they lost 21–28 to ASM Clermont Auvergne.

===Donnybrook Stadium===

Leinster&#x27;s traditional home over the years has been Donnybrook Stadium in Donnybrook, Dublin 4. Donnybrook consists of a single covered stand and three sides of open terracing. A move across Dublin 4 to the RDS Arena for Leinster was needed to accommodate growing crowds, as the 6,000 capacity stadium had become too small. For this reason, Leinster have signed a long-term lease with the Royal Dublin Society to play home games at the RDS Arena. Donnybrook has since, been improved as a venue with the reconstruction of the grandstand in 2008 and remains an important venue for rugby union in Dublin. Due to limited space, it is unlikely that Donnybrook will undergo further redevelopment. Leinster A play their British and Irish Cup games in the stadium and the senior team have continued to hold certain pre-season friendlies in the stadium as well as most Leinster schools cup matches being held at the venue.

==Supporters==
Before the advent of professionalism in the Irish game, provincial rugby games were generally poorly attended. During most of the 1990s, Leinster matches regularly attracted crowds of about 500 to 2,000. The decision to structure the game professionally via the provincial network through centralised player contracts and the subsequent on-field success achieved by Leinster and the other provinces resulted in a significant increase in support within a decade. Leinster had 3,700 season ticket holders in 2006, double the number of the previous season. The Official Leinster Supporters Club was formally established as a club in 2007. The last match at the old Lansdowne Road stadium was against Ulster on 31 December 2006 before it was demolished to make way for the new Aviva Stadium, earning the match the moniker of &quot;The Last Stand&quot;. Leinster won the match 20–12, with an attendance of 48,000 – a record at the time. A previous attendance record in the Pro12 was also set at Lansdowne Road, for a game between Leinster and Munster which drew a crowd of 30,000. Leinster&#x27;s supporters were named as &#x27;Player of the Month&#x27; for April 2009 following their support in the European Cup Quarter Final against Harlequins at The Stoop.
On several occasions Leinster have set the record for the largest Celtic league and Pro12 attendances. On 2 October 2010, Leinster beat Munster 13–9 in the 5th round of the league at the Aviva Stadium. This set a new crowd attendance record for a Pro12 game at 50,645. They subsequently set a new record on 29 March 2014 during a sellout match against Munster in which 51,700 fans were in attendance. This Pro12 record was subsequently surpassed by attendances at the Judgement Day fixtures. During the 2014–15 Pro12 season Leinster had the best support of any club in the PRO12 league with an average attendance of 17,717.

Leinster&#x27;s European Cup clash against Munster at Croke Park on 2 May 2009 set a world record attendance at the time for a club rugby union game with a crowd of 82,208.

==Leinster A==

Leinster A is the team that represents Leinster in the British &amp; Irish Cup, having won the competition a record two times to date, in the 2012–13 season as well as the 2013–14 season, also becoming the first and only side to ever successfully defend the trophy. Leinster A also compete in the All Ireland Inter-provincial Championship. Pre-professionalism and a formal Celtic league structure, the main Leinster team competed in the AIIPC. Since the advent of professionalism, the provinces have fielded lesser teams to concentrate on the Celtic League. The team is composed of Senior Leinster squad players requiring game time, Development contract &amp; Academy players and, occasionally, AIL players called up from their clubs.

For the 2019–20 season, the Leinster A team is coached by Noel McNamara.

==Sponsorship==
From the 2007–08 season to the 2017–18 season Leinster&#x27;s kits were supplied by Canterbury of New Zealand but for the next five seasons starting with the 2018 -19 season Leinster&#x27;s kits were supplied by Adidas. Their kits are now supplied by Castore. Bank of Ireland, the country&#x27;s oldest banking institution are Leinster&#x27;s primary sponsors appearing in the front of their shirt, their sleeves, the top back of their shirt and the front right of their shorts. The Bank of Ireland symbol appeared on Leinster&#x27;s front right and front left collars. On occasion, the team will wear a shirt adorned with the logo of another sponsor due to a promotion run annually by the bank offering up the sponsorship space to an Irish business by way of a competition to win the right to become a sponsor for a day. During the 2013–14 season the contest was won by Dublin-based meat wholesaler Gahan Meats and for 2014–15 the shirt sponsorship winners were accounting software provider Big Red Cloud. The sponsorship prize package is valued at €50,000 and attracts hundreds of companies keen to be shortlisted each year. The left of Leinster&#x27;s back shorts had Bank of Ireland between 2009 and 2013 where it was replaced by Bank of Ireland&#x27;s Twitter address right up until 2015 where it was replaced by Laya Healthcare. The teams &#x27;official airline&#x27; is Irelands&#x27; CityJet.

The Welsh side, Celtic Warriors competed in the Celtic league during the first couple of seasons and have a winning record against Leinster of two wins and zero defeats.

<doc id="985963" wikidata="Q692197" url="?curid=985963" title="Lambda-CDM model">
<text>The Lambda-CDM, Lambda cold dark matter, or ΛCDM model is a mathematical model of the Big Bang theory with three major components:
# a cosmological constant, denoted by lambda (Λ), associated with dark energy;
# the postulated cold dark matter, denoted by CDM;
# ordinary matter.

It is the current &quot;standard model&quot; of Big Bang cosmology, as it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of:
* the existence and structure of the cosmic microwave background;
* the large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies;
* the observed abundances of hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium;
* the accelerating expansion of the universe observed in the light from distant galaxies and supernovae.

The model assumes that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales. It emerged in the late 1990s as a concordance cosmology, after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model has been successful in modeling broad collection of astronomical observations over decades. Remaining issues challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model and have led to many alternative models.

== Overview ==
The ΛCDM model is based on three postulates on the structure of spacetime:
# The cosmological principle, that the universe is the same everywhere and in all directions, and that it is expanding,
# A postulate by Hermann Weyl that the lines of spacetime (geodesics) intersect at only one point, where time along each line can be synchronized; the behavior resembles an expanding perfect fluid,
# general relativity that relates the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy.
This combination greatly simplifies the equations of general relativity into a form called the Friedmann equations. These equations specify the evolution of the scale factor the universe in terms of the pressure and density of a perfect fluid. The evolving density is composed of different kinds of energy and matter, each with its own role in affecting the scale factor. For example, a model might include baryons, photons, neutrinos, and dark matter. These component densities become parameters extracted when the model is constrained to match astrophysical observations. The model aims to describe the observable universe from approximately 0.1 s to the present.

The most accurate observations which are sensitive to the component densities are consequences of statistical inhomogeneity called &quot;perturbations&quot; in the early universe. Since the Friedmann equations assume homogeneity, additional theory must be added before comparison to experiments. Inflation is a simple model producing perturbations by postulating an extremely rapid expansion early in the universe that separates quantum fluctuations before they can equilibrate. The perturbations are characterized by additional parameters also determined by matching observations.

Finally, the light which will become astronomical observations must pass through the universe. The latter part of that journey will pass through ionized space, where the electrons can scatter the light, altering the anisotropies. This effect is characterized by one additional parameter.

The ΛCDM model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented, both as the redshift of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies, and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a Doppler shift in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. Also, since it originates from ordinary general relativity, it, like general relativity, allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter Λ (lambda) represents the cosmological constant, which is associated with a vacuum energy or dark energy in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, formula_1, which contributes to the stress–energy tensor that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, formula_2, is estimated to be 0.669 ± 0.038 based on the 2018 Dark Energy Survey results using Type Ia supernovae or based on the 2018 release of &quot;Planck&quot; satellite data, or more than 68.3% (2018 estimate) of the mass–energy density of the universe.

Dark matter is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the &quot;non-keplerian&quot; rotation curves of galaxies; the gravitational lensing of light by galaxy clusters; and the enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter.
The ΛCDM model proposes specifically cold dark matter, hypothesized as:
* Non-baryonic: Consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons)
* Cold: Its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation–matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold)
* Dissipationless: Cannot cool by radiating photons
* Collisionless: Dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force

Dark matter constitutes about 26.5% of the mass–energy density of the universe. The remaining 4.9% comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe.

The model includes a single originating event, the &quot;Big Bang&quot;, which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding spacetime containing radiation at temperatures of around 1015 K. This was immediately (within 10−29 seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 1027 or more, known as cosmic inflation. The early universe remained hot (above 10 000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual cosmic microwave background, or CMB, a very low-energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The &quot;Big Bang&quot; scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of lighter elements in the universe (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities (anisotropies) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the &quot;horizon problem&quot; in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable particle horizon.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parameterized by a dimensionless scale factor formula_3 (with time formula_4 counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present time, so formula_5; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so formula_6 denotes the age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed redshift formula_7 of the light emitted at time formula_8 by
: formula_9
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent Hubble parameter, formula_10, defined as
: formula_11
where formula_12 is the time-derivative of the scale factor. The first Friedmann equation gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density the curvature and the cosmological constant 
: formula_13
where, as usual is the speed of light and is the gravitational constant. 
A critical density formula_14 is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature formula_15, assuming the cosmological constant formula_16 is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives
: formula_17
where formula_18 is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a Big Crunch, or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the dark energy is not constant but actually time-dependent.

The present-day density parameter formula_19 for various species is defined as the dimensionless ratio
: formula_20
where the subscript formula_21 is one of formula_22 for baryons, formula_23 for cold dark matter, formula_24 for radiation (photons plus relativistic neutrinos), and formula_16 for dark energy.

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of formula_26, e.g. formula_27 for matter etc.,
the Friedmann equation can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
: formula_28
where formula_29 is the equation of state parameter of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various formula_30 parameters add up to formula_31 by construction. In the general case this is integrated by computer to give the expansion history formula_32 and also observable distance–redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature formula_33 is zero and formula_34, so this simplifies to
: formula_35

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, formula_36; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution
: formula_37
where formula_38
this is fairly accurate for formula_39 or formula_40 million years.
Solving for formula_41 gives the present age of the universe formula_42 in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative formula_43 crossing zero) occurred when
: formula_44
which evaluates to formula_45 or formula_46 for the best-fit parameters estimated from the &quot;Planck&quot; spacecraft.

== Parameters ==
Multiple variants of the ΛCDM model are used with some differences in parameters. One such set is outlined in the table below. 
The Planck collaboration version of the ΛCDM model is based on six parameters: baryon density parameter; dark matter density parameter; scalar spectral index; two parameters related to curvature fluctuation amplitude; and the probability that photons from the early universe will be scattered once on route (called reionization optical depth). Six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to the observations; other possible parameters are fixed at &quot;natural&quot; values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1.

The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy density, can be calculated.

== Historical development ==
The discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the Big Bang cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density.

During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of cosmic inflation motivated models with critical density.

During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988–1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted.

These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by the Cosmic Background Explorer in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of accelerating expansion in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the BOOMERanG microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the 2dFGRS galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or dark energy. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from WMAP in 2003–2010 and &quot;Planck&quot; in 2013–2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

== Successes ==
Among all cosmological models, the ΛCDM model has been the most successful; it describes a wide range of astronomical observations with remarkable accuracy. The notable successes include:
* Accurate modeling the high-precision CMB angular distribution measure by the Planck mission and Atacama Cosmology Telescope.
* Accurate description of the linear E-mode polarization of the CMB radiation due to fluctuations on the surface of last scattering events.
* Prediction of the observed B-mode polarization of the CMB light due to primordial gravitational waves. 
* Observations of H2O emission spectra from a galaxy 12.8 billion light years away consistent with molecules excited by cosmic background radiation much more energetic – 16-20K – than the CMB we observe now, 3K. 
* Predictions of the primordial abundance of deuterium as a result of Big bang nucleosynthesis. The observed abundance matches the one derived from the nucleosynthesis model with the value for baryon density derived from CMB measurements.
In addition to explaining many pre-2000 observations, the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak gravitational lensing, first observed in 2000 by several teams. The polarization of the CMB, discovered in 2002 by DASI, has been successfully predicted by the model: in the 2015 &quot;Planck&quot; data release, there are seven observed peaks in the temperature (TT) power spectrum, six peaks in the temperature–polarization (TE) cross spectrum, and five peaks in the polarization (EE) spectrum. The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed.

== Challenges ==
Despite the widespread success of ΛCDM in matching observations of our universe, cosmologists believe that the model may be an approximation of a more fundamental model.

=== Lack of detection ===
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection, while dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is extremely small compared to vacuum energy theoretical predictions.

=== Violations of the cosmological principle ===

The ΛCDM model, like all models built on the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, assume that the universe looks the same in all directions (isotropy) and from every location (homogeneity) if you look at a large enough scale: &quot;the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are.&quot; This cosmological principle allows a metric, Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, to be derived and developed into a theory to compare to experiments. Without the principle, a metric would need to be extracted from astronomical data, which may not be possible. The assumptions were carried over into the ΛCDM model. However, some findings suggested violations of the cosmological principle.

==== Violations of isotropy ====
Evidence from galaxy clusters, quasars, and type Ia supernovae suggest that isotropy is violated on large scales.

Data from the Planck Mission shows hemispheric bias in the cosmic microwave background in two respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). The European Space Agency (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies in the CMB are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.

Already in 1967, Dennis Sciama predicted that the cosmic microwave background has a significant dipole anisotropy. In recent years, the CMB dipole has been tested, and the results suggest our motion with respect to distant radio galaxies and quasars differs from our motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background. The same conclusion has been reached in recent studies of the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae and quasars. This contradicts the cosmological principle.

The CMB dipole is hinted at through a number of other observations. First, even within the cosmic microwave background, there are curious directional alignments and an anomalous parity asymmetry that may have an origin in the CMB dipole. Separately, the CMB dipole direction has emerged as a preferred direction in studies of alignments in quasar polarizations, scaling relations in galaxy clusters, strong lensing time delay, Type Ia supernovae, and quasars and gamma-ray bursts as standard candles. The fact that all these independent observables, based on different physics, are tracking the CMB dipole direction suggests that the Universe is anisotropic in the direction of the CMB dipole.

Nevertheless, some authors have stated that the universe around Earth is isotropic at high significance by studies of the combined cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization maps.

==== Violations of homogeneity ====
The homogeneity of the universe needed for the ΛCDM applies to very large volumes of space.
N-body simulations in ΛCDM show that the spatial distribution of galaxies is statistically homogeneous if averaged over scales 260/h Mpc or more. 
Numerous claims of large-scale structures reported to be in conflict with the predicted scale of homogeneity for ΛCDM do not withstand statistical analysis.

=== El Gordo galaxy cluster collision ===
El Gordo is a massive interacting galaxy cluster in the early Universe (formula_47). The extreme properties of El Gordo in terms of its redshift, mass, and the collision velocity leads to strong (formula_48) tension with the ΛCDM model. The properties of El Gordo are however consistent with cosmological simulations in the framework of MOND due to more rapid structure formation.

=== KBC void ===
The KBC void is an immense, comparatively empty region of space containing the Milky Way approximately 2 billion light-years (600 megaparsecs, Mpc) in diameter. Some authors have said the existence of the KBC void violates the assumption that the CMB reflects baryonic density fluctuations at formula_49 or Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, either of which would violate the ΛCDM model, while other authors have claimed that supervoids as large as the KBC void are consistent with the ΛCDM model.

=== Hubble tension ===

Statistically significant differences remain in values of the Hubble constant derived by matching the ΛCDM model to data from the &quot;early universe&quot;, like the cosmic background radiation, compared to values derived from stellar distance measurements, called the &quot;late universe&quot;. While systematic error in the measurements remains a possibility, many different kinds of observations agree with one of these two values of the constant. This difference, called the Hubble tension, widely acknowledged to be a major problem for the ΛCDM model.

Dozens of proposals for modifications of ΛCDM or completely new models have been published to explain the Hubble tension. Among these models are many that modify the properties of dark energy or of dark matter over time, interactions between dark energy and dark matter, unified dark energy and matter, other forms of dark radiation like sterile neutrinos, modifications to the properties of gravity, or the modification of the effects of inflation, changes to the properties of elementary particles in the early universe, among others. None of these models can simultaneously explain the breadth of other cosmological data as well as ΛCDM.

=== &quot;S&quot;8 tension ===
The &quot;formula_50 tension&quot; is a name for another question mark for the ΛCDM model. The formula_50 parameter in the ΛCDM model quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the late universe and is defined as
: formula_52

Early- (e.g. from CMB data collected using the Planck observatory) and late-time (e.g. measuring weak gravitational lensing events) facilitate increasingly precise values of formula_50. However, these two categories of measurement differ by more standard deviations than their uncertainties. This discrepancy is called the formula_50 tension. The name &quot;tension&quot; reflects that the disagreement is not merely between two data sets: the many sets of early- and late-time measurements agree well within their own categories, but there is an unexplained difference between values obtained from different points in the evolution of the universe. Such a tension indicates that the ΛCDM model may be incomplete or in need of correction.

Some values for formula_50 are (2020 Planck), (2021 KIDS), (2022 DES), (2023 DES+KIDS), – (2023 HSC-SSP), (2024 EROSITA). Values have also obtained using peculiar velocities, (2020) and (2020), among other methods.

=== Axis of evil ===

=== Cosmological lithium problem ===
The actual observable amount of lithium in the universe is less than the calculated amount from the ΛCDM model by a factor of 3–4. If every calculation is correct, then solutions beyond the existing ΛCDM model might be needed.

=== Shape of the universe ===

The ΛCDM model assumes that the shape of the universe is of zero curvature (is flat) and has an undetermined topology. In 2019, interpretation of Planck data suggested that the curvature of the universe might be positive (often called &quot;closed&quot;), which would contradict the ΛCDM model. Some authors have suggested that the Planck data detecting a positive curvature could be evidence of a local inhomogeneity in the curvature of the universe rather than the universe actually being globally a 3-manifold of positive curvature.

=== Violations of the strong equivalence principle ===

The ΛCDM model assumes that the strong equivalence principle is true. However, in 2020 a group of astronomers analyzed data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample, together with estimates of the large-scale external gravitational field from an all-sky galaxy catalog. They concluded that there was highly statistically significant evidence of violations of the strong equivalence principle in weak gravitational fields in the vicinity of rotationally supported galaxies. They observed an effect inconsistent with tidal effects in the ΛCDM model. These results have been challenged as failing to consider inaccuracies in the rotation curves and correlations between galaxy properties and clustering strength. and as inconsistent with similar analysis of other galaxies.

=== Cold dark matter discrepancies ===

Several discrepancies between the predictions of cold dark matter in the ΛCDM model and observations of galaxies and their clustering have arisen. Some of these problems have proposed solutions, but it remains unclear whether they can be solved without abandoning the ΛCDM model.

Milgrom, McGaugh, and Kroupa have criticized the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of galaxy formation models and supporting the alternative modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory, which requires a modification of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations as seen in proposals such as modified gravity theory (MOG theory) or tensor–vector–scalar gravity theory (TeVeS theory). Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein&#x27;s general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include f(R) gravity, scalar–tensor theories such as theories (see Galilean invariance), brane cosmologies, the DGP model, and massive gravity and its extensions such as bimetric gravity.

==== Cuspy halo problem ====

The density distributions of dark matter halos in cold dark matter simulations (at least those that do not include the impact of baryonic feedback) are much more peaked than what is observed in galaxies by investigating their rotation curves.

==== Dwarf galaxy problem ====
Cold dark matter simulations predict large numbers of small dark matter halos, more numerous than the number of small dwarf galaxies that are observed around galaxies like the Milky Way.

==== Satellite disk problem ====
Dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are observed to be orbiting in thin, planar structures whereas the simulations predict that they should be distributed randomly about their parent galaxies. However, latest research suggests this seemingly bizarre alignment is just a quirk which will dissolve over time.

==== High-velocity galaxy problem ====
Galaxies in the NGC 3109 association are moving away too rapidly to be consistent with expectations in the ΛCDM model. In this framework, NGC 3109 is too massive and distant from the Local Group for it to have been flung out in a three-body interaction involving the Milky Way or Andromeda Galaxy.

==== Galaxy morphology problem ====
If galaxies grew hierarchically, then massive galaxies required many mergers. Major mergers inevitably create a classical bulge. On the contrary, about 80% of observed galaxies give evidence of no such bulges, and giant pure-disc galaxies are commonplace. The tension can be quantified by comparing the observed distribution of galaxy shapes today with predictions from high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in the ΛCDM framework, revealing a highly significant problem that is unlikely to be solved by improving the resolution of the simulations. The high bulgeless fraction was nearly constant for 8 billion years.

==== Fast galaxy bar problem ====
If galaxies were embedded within massive halos of cold dark matter, then the bars that often develop in their central regions would be slowed down by dynamical friction with the halo. This is in serious tension with the fact that observed galaxy bars are typically fast.

==== Small scale crisis ====
Comparison of the model with observations may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting too many dwarf galaxies and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the &quot;small scale crisis&quot;. These small scales are harder to resolve in computer simulations, so it is not yet clear whether the problem is the simulations, non-standard properties of dark matter, or a more radical error in the model.

==== High redshift galaxies ====
Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in various galaxies confirmed by spectroscopy at high redshift, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 at cosmological redshift of 13.2. Other candidate galaxies which have not been confirmed by spectroscopy include CEERS-93316 at cosmological redshift of 16.4.

Existence of surprisingly massive galaxies in the early universe challenges the preferred models describing how dark matter halos drive galaxy formation. It remains to be seen whether a revision of the Lambda-CDM model with parameters given by Planck Collaboration is necessary to resolve this issue. The discrepancies could also be explained by particular properties (stellar masses or effective volume) of the candidate galaxies, yet unknown force or particle outside of the Standard Model through which dark matter interacts, more efficient baryonic matter accumulation by the dark matter halos, early dark energy models, or the hypothesized long-sought Population III stars.

=== Missing baryon problem ===

Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci first estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following formula_56), weighted with the luminosity function formula_57 over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects:
: formula_58

The result was:
: formula_59
where formula_60.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis formula_61, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the &quot;missing baryons&quot;.

The missing baryon problem is claimed to be resolved. Using observations of the kinematic Sunyaev–Zel&#x27;dovich effect spanning more than 90% of the lifetime of the Universe, in 2021 astrophysicists found that approximately 50% of all baryonic matter is outside dark matter haloes, filling the space between galaxies. Together with the amount of baryons inside galaxies and surrounding them, the total amount of baryons in the late time Universe is compatible with early Universe measurements.

=== Unfalsifiability ===
It has been argued that the ΛCDM model is built upon a foundation of conventionalist stratagems, rendering it unfalsifiable in the sense defined by Karl Popper.

== Extended models ==
Extended models allow one or more of the &quot;fixed&quot; parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (formula_62 may be different from 1); or quintessence rather than a cosmological constant where the equation of state of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted formula_63), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally &quot;increase&quot; the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The table below shows results for each of the possible &quot;6+1&quot; scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio formula_63 should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are within those limits.

Stephen Yan (born 1939 in Hong Kong) is a Canadian television host. He hosted the Canadian television cooking show for CBC Television, &quot;Wok with Yan&quot;.

The Vancouver-based chef moved to Canada in the 1960s and owned two Chinese restaurants in Vancouver. Yan developed &quot;Wok With Yan&quot; with Carleton Productions in Ottawa, which had previously produced &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot;, and filmed two pilots in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the series to CTV Television. The network wasn&#x27;t interested in the show, however, as they already had a cooking show and were also unimpressed with Martin Yan&#x27;s &quot;Yan Can&quot; out of Calgary, which soured them on the concept of a Chinese cooking show. Yan returned to Vancouver where BCTV offered him a local show, which aired as &quot;Yan&#x27;s Woking&quot; for two seasons in the late 1970s. The weekly show was very successful and drew more viewers than &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in the same timeslot. CBC Television then agreed to buy &quot;Wok With Yan&quot;, originally as a summer replacement, for national broadcast on the network. The show, co-produced by Carleton Productions and Stephen Yan Productions, was originally filmed at CJOH&#x27;s studios in Ottawa for two seasons before moving production to CBC Vancouver where new episodes were filmed until 1995. It initially aired on the CBC Television Network before moving to syndication and was sold around the world, including in the United States and Asia. Over 15 years, Yan produced over 500 episodes of &quot;Wok with Yan&quot;.

Yan also has produced travel and variety shows called &quot;Wok&#x27;s Up?&quot; for CBC, and several half-hour travel specials on Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Walt Disney World, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji.

On May 14, 1986, Yan also released a 60-minute show on video cassette titled, &quot;Wok On The Wild Side, Wok With Yan Volume 2&quot;, where he showed how to prepare and cook the following menu: prawns in a nest, egg rolls, sweet and sour fish, gold coin beef, hot and sour soup, ginger lobster, and chicken with pineapple.
Yan&#x27;s charismatic personality on his television show can be attributed to his spontaneous humour that included one-liners spoken with his trademark Cantonese accent or him playing with his food or cookware. He has appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, and other shows from the United States to Australia.

A trademark of his was aprons that bore a different &#x27;wok&#x27; pun every show. 

Yan was the author of bestselling cook books:

* &quot;Vegetables the Chinese Way&quot; 
* &quot;Creative Carving&quot;
* &quot;The Stephen Yan Seafood Wokbook&quot;
* &quot;Wok with Yan Television Cookbook&quot;

He also created various names for some of the ingredients that he used in his cooking, they include:

*&quot;Chinese Water&quot;
*&quot;Wonder Powder&quot;
*&quot;Five Spicey&quot;

&quot;Wok Before You Run&quot; is another cooking videotape produced in the 1980s and distributed worldwide.

He is not related to Chinese-American chef Martin Yan of the PBS series &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot;, though Martin Yan worked for Stephen Yan for a year and was a protege who was trained as one of Stephen Yan&#x27;s &#x27;Flying Squad&#x27; of six chefs who flew across Canada to do demonstrations in Chinese cooking for events like the Calgary Stampede, the Klondike Days in Edmonton and houseware demonstrations at Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company stores.

<text>Hvitserk (&quot;Hvítserkr&quot;, &quot;White-Shirt&quot;) was one of the sons of the legendary 9th-century Viking Ragnar Lodbrok and his wife Aslaug.

==Sources==
Hvitserk is attested to by the Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons (&quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;). He is not mentioned in any source that mentions Halfdan Ragnarsson, one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army that invaded the Kingdom of East Anglia in 867, or vice versa, which consequently led some scholars to suggest that they are the same individual with &quot;Hvitserk&quot; being only a nickname.

After having avenged his father together with his brothers, he went to Gardarike (&quot;Garðaríki&quot;). Hvitserk also pillaged with the Rus. He was, however, opposed by such a large foe that he could not win. When asked about how he wished to die, he decided to be burned alive at a stake of human remains.

The Ukrainian historian Leontii Voitovych assumed that Hvitserk was possibly another name of the Kievan prince Askold.

Modern depictions of Hvitserk as a son of Ragnar include History&#x27;s historical drama television series &quot;Vikings&quot;, where he features as Ragnar&#x27;s son by Aslaug (played by Marco Ilsø).

<doc id="985967" wikidata="Q263665" url="?curid=985967" title="Gaston Rébuffat">
<text>Gaston Rébuffat (; 7 May 1921, Marseille – 31 May 1985, Paris) was a French alpinist, mountain guide, and author. He is well known as a member of the first expedition to summit Annapurna 1 in 1950 and the first man to climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps. In 1984, he was made an officer in the French Legion of Honour for his service as a mountaineering instructor for the French military. At the age of 64, Gaston Rébuffat died of cancer in Paris, France. The rock-climbing technique, the &quot;Gaston&quot;, was named after him. A photo of Rébuffat atop the Aiguille du Roc in the French Alps is on the Voyager Golden Records.

== Early life ==
Gaston Rébuffat was born on 7 May 1921 in Marseilles, France. He began climbing at the age of 14 in the Calanques near Marseilles. At the age of 16, he became a member of the Club Alpin Français (French Alpine Club), where he was introduced to high altitude mountaineering. There he met Lionel Terray, a French mountaineer who would join Rébuffat on the 1950 Annapurna ascent. He later moved to Chamonix, France and became a member of the Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix. He soon began climbing in the Alps, where he would spend much of his career.

== Climbing career ==

=== Instructor and guide ===
During World War II, Gaston Rébuffat attended Jeunesse et Montagne, a French youth training organization. He graduated in 1942, earning his mountain guide certification at the age of 21, despite the minimum age for certification being 23. He continued as an instructor for Jeunesse et Montagne, until, in 1944, he became an instructor for the French National Ski and Mountaineering School (ENSA) as well as the High Mountain Military School, where he served as a mountaineering instructor for several years, eventually earning him the Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

After some time as an instructor, Rébuffat wanted to spend more time as a guide. He stated in his 1954 work &quot;Starlight and Storm&quot;: &quot;Each winter I found myself impatiently awaiting July. At last, the day would come for departure to Ailefroide or Chamonix. There I would spend a few days on the tops, only to return and wait for another year. Then one day, deciding that I must live among the mountains, I became a guide.&quot; In 1945, Rébuffat left his position at the ENSA to become a mountain guide in the Alps. Throughout his career, he guided many climbers and mountaineers, both new and experienced, up the mountains of the Alps. By the 1950s he was known as one of the foremost experts on the Mont Blanc Massif in the Alps, where he had set several routes himself.

=== Alpine north faces ===
One of Rébuffat&#x27;s most famous accomplishments is his ascent of the six great north faces of the Alps. He began planning for his first ascent, the Grandes Jorasses, in the summer of 1938 at the age of 17, shortly after the first ascent of the mountain&#x27;s north face by Italian mountaineers Riccardo Cassin, Gino Esposito, and Ugo Tizzoni. In 1943, Rébuffat made his first attempt at the summit but was not successful due to poor weather conditions. He returned to the mountain in July 1945 and successfully climbed the north face with the assistance of Édouard Frendo. In August 1949, he attempted and successfully completed an ascent of the northeast face of Piz Badile, during which he acted as a mountain guide for an amateur mountaineer. By this time, Rébuffat was among a handful of elite mountaineers to have climbed these faces. This led to his selection as one of the principal members of the 1950 Annapurna expedition. Over the next several years, he guided mountaineers, both new and experienced, up the remaining great north faces, the Petit Dru, the Matterhorn, the Cima Grande di Lavaredo, and the Eiger.

=== Annapurna===

In 1950, Gaston Rébuffat was part of an expedition to summit Annapurna 1, the tallest point of the Annapurna Massif in the Himalayas and the tenth-highest peak in the world. The expedition was led by Maurice Herzog and also included French mountaineers Louis Lachenal and Lionel Terray. The expedition began in March 1950, with the actual ascent of Annapurna 1 beginning in May. During the ascent, a base camp and four intermediate camps were set up, with the highest being about 7400 meters in altitude. The summit itself was completed on 3 June 1950 by Herzog and Lachenal. While traveling down from the top camp, the four mountaineers were unable to locate the next camp and were forced to spend the night in a crevasse. All members survived the expedition, but Herzog and Lachenal later lost several fingers and toes due to severe frostbite. Although Rébuffat did not summit the mountain, he was instrumental in ensuring his injured colleagues returned safely. The expedition is known to be the first ascent of any mountain over 8000 meters and was the highest mountain climb ever at the time.

==Writing==
Known for his lyrical writing and his ability to convey not only the dangers of mountaineering but the pure exaltation of the climb, Rébuffat authored several books, many of which he published in his own publishing house. His most famous written work is &quot;Etoiles et Tempêtes&quot; (&quot;Starlight and Storm&quot;), first published in French in 1954, and in English in 1956.

== Filmography ==
Rébuffat produced three colour films depicting himself and others climbing in the Alps. These are a testament to his skill as a climber, and his love of the mountains. &quot;Étoiles et Tempêtes&quot; won the Grand Prix at the Trento Film Festival in Trento, Italy.

<text>Amaknak Island () or Umaknak Island (; ) is the most populated island in the Aleutian Islands, an archipelago which is part of the U.S. state of Alaska.

==Geography==
Amaknak is an islet of the Fox Islands archipelago, a portion of the Aleutian Islands, in the Aleutians West Census Area of southwestern Alaska. Amaknak Island is located within Unalaska Bay, an inlet of the Bering Sea on the northeast side of Unalaska Island. At their closest point—the channel that leads from Unalaska Bay to Iliuliuk Harbor—the two islands are only about apart. There is a 500-foot (152-meter) bridge joining the islands at another close point, where Iliuliuk Harbor connects with Captains Bay.

Amaknak&#x27;s land area is , which is dwarfed by its neighbor Unalaska Island, which has a land area of 1,051 sq. miles (2,722 km2). The highest point on Amaknak is Mount Ballyhoo.

==Population==
Despite its small size, Amaknak is the most populous of all the islands of the Aleutians chain, with 2,524 residents as of the 2000 census. Though located within the boundaries of the City of Unalaska, the inhabitants of Amaknak generally regard themselves as residents of Dutch Harbor, which is the portion of the City of Unalaska located on Amaknak Island. (The remaining 41% of Unalaska&#x27;s residents live on Unalaska Island.)

<doc id="985976" wikidata="Q7375047" url="?curid=985976" title="Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927">
<text>The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 4) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that authorised the alteration of the British monarch&#x27;s royal style and titles, and altered the formal name of the British Parliament and hence of the state, in recognition of most of Ireland separating from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. It received royal assent on 12 April 1927.

==Background to the act==
As a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, in December 1922 most of Ireland was detached from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to become the Irish Free State. However, six north-eastern counties, all within Ulster, remained united with Great Britain as Northern Ireland.

The King&#x27;s title, proclaimed under the Royal Titles Act 1901, was:
&quot;George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot;
At the 1926 Imperial Conference, it was agreed by the Imperial government at Whitehall and those of the various Dominions that the existing royal style and titles of their shared monarch &quot;hardly accorded with the altered state of affairs arising from the establishment of the Irish Free State as a Dominion&quot;. The Conference concluded that the wording should be changed to:
&quot;George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot;

Under the existing constitutional arrangements of the British Commonwealth, it was necessary for legislation to be enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in order for the royal style and titles to be altered; the resulting Act would then extend automatically into the law of the various Dominions. The British Government introduced the necessary bill into the House of Commons in March 1927 and easily secured its passage through both Houses of Parliament.

==Provisions of the act==
The act contained three substantive provisions.

Firstly, the King was authorised to issue a royal proclamation within six months of the act&#x27;s passing, authorising him to alter the royal style and titles. Following the precedent set by similar legislation in the past, the act did not itself set out the form of the new style and titles that were to be adopted.

Secondly, the act formally renamed the parliament sitting at Westminster from &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; to &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.

Finally, the act established that the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, when used in &quot;every Act [of Parliament] passed and public document issued after the passing of this Act&quot;, would mean Great Britain and Northern Ireland (unless the context required otherwise).

A royal proclamation was subsequently issued under the terms of the act on 13 May 1927. The proclamation followed the recommendation of the Imperial Conference by altering the Latin and English forms of the existing royal style and titles, the former by replacing &quot; with &quot;, and the latter by replacing &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of&quot; with &quot;Great Britain, Ireland and&quot;.

The Great Seal of the Realm and Great Seal of Scotland were replaced to update the change of royal style. The new designs by Percy Metcalfe were delivered at a Privy Council meeting on 27 October 1930.

==Subsequent developments==
Over the next quarter of the century the relationship between the various members of the Commonwealth continued to evolve. In particular, the outcome of the 1930 Imperial Conference (and the resultant Statute of Westminster 1931), the formal declaration by the Irish state of its republican status and its consequent secession, as the Republic of Ireland, from the Commonwealth, and the request by India that it remain a member of the Commonwealth despite adopting a republican constitution, all altered both the nature and composition of the Commonwealth.

The royal style and titles were altered in 1948, to reflect the independence of India the previous year by omitting the title &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. However, the accession of a new monarch (Elizabeth II) in 1952 was taken as an opportunity to completely alter both the form of the style and titles, and the manner in which they would be legislated for; henceforth, each Commonwealth realm would pass its own legislation establishing its own version of the style and titles. The resulting legislation for the United Kingdom and its dependencies was the Royal Titles Act 1953. The reference to &quot;Ireland&quot; in the royal style and title was not changed to &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; until May 1953.

<text>Gonzalo Enrique Márquez Moya (March 31, 1940 – December 19, 1984) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics (1972–73) and Chicago Cubs (1973–74). Although baseball references during his career (and afterwards) showed the year of his birth as 1946, his birth certificate showed the true year to be 1940. Márquez presented an ID that showed 1946 when he turned professional.

Márquez was a left-handed batter, hitting .235 (27-for-115) with one home run, 10 runs batted in, nine runs, three doubles and one stolen base in 76 games. However, his skill as a contact hitter was visible in the postseason. In eight playoff and World Series games in 1972, he hit 5-for-8 for a .625 BA with two RBIs and one run scored. He&#x27;s still well remembered by the Oakland fans for his contribution off the bench.

Marquez was also known as a fine fielder at first base. On May 5, 1973, against the Cleveland Indians, he became the last left-handed player to be listed in the lineup card as a second baseman in a major-league game. He did not appear in the field at second, though.

Márquez enjoyed a long career at home in the Venezuelan Winter League, nearly all of it with the Leones del Caracas club. He compiled a record of .288 with 16 homers and 295 RBI in 833 games, from 1965 to 1984. In the 1970 Caribbean Series, he led all players with a .440 batting average and 4 stolen bases, to help the Navegantes del Magallanes win the series, marking the first time a Venezuelan team had taken the title.

Gonzalo Márquez was killed in a car accident as he was returning home from a baseball game in Valencia with two of his sons. He and the boys stopped for a roast pork sandwich at a nationally known roadside eatery, but another car prevented them from leaving the parking lot. Once Marquez did get back out onto the road, a drunk driver struck his car. Marquez died (though the two boys survived).

<text>Appeal to motive is a pattern of argument which consists in challenging a thesis by calling into question the motives of its proposer. It can be considered as a special case of the ad hominem circumstantial argument. As such, this type of argument is an informal fallacy.

A common feature of appeals to motive is that only the possibility of a motive (however small) is shown, without showing the motive actually existed or, if the motive did exist, that the motive played a role in forming the argument and its conclusion. Indeed, it is often assumed that the mere possibility of motive is evidence enough.

* &quot;That website recommended ACME&#x27;s widget over Megacorp&#x27;s widget. But the website also displays ACME advertising on their site, so they must be biased in their review.&quot; The thesis in this case is the website&#x27;s evaluation of the relative merits of the two products.
* &quot;The referee is a New York City native, so his refereeing was obviously biased towards New York teams.&quot; In this case, the thesis consists of the referee&#x27;s rulings.

<text>John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, 3rd Earl of Nottingham, 8th Baron Mowbray, 9th Baron Segrave KG, Earl Marshal (139219 October 1432) was an English nobleman and soldier. He was a younger son of the first Duke of Norfolk and Lady Elizabeth Fitzalan, but inherited his father&#x27;s earldom of Norfolk (but not the dukedom) when his elder brother rebelled against King Henry IV and was executed before reaching the age of inheritance. This and the fact that his mother lived to old age and held a third of his estates in dower, meant that until the last few years of his life he was, although an important political figure, poorly-off financially.

Probably due to the need to augment his income, he took the still-popular path for young members of the English nobility by taking part in the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France. His first campaign was in 1415 with Henry V, and although he took part in some of the great expeditions, he, like so many of his comrades, fell badly ill with dysentery and had to return to England. For this reason, he missed the Battle of Agincourt.

When Henry V died in 1422, Mowbray remained a leading commander of the armed forces in France for the new boy-king, Henry VI. He continued campaigning there for the next five years, and, when parliament decided it was time to crown the new young king—in both Westminster Abbey and in France—Mowbray acted as both royal bodyguard and councillor. He also took part in Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s personal campaign in Hainaut, which appears for once to have been profitable to him.

Foreign service occupied most of Mowbray&#x27;s career but often cost him more than he gained from any spoils. Hence it was not until his mother died in 1425 that his fortunes changed for the better; not only did he inherit her large share of his father&#x27;s estates, but he also received promotion from Earl of Norfolk to Duke of Norfolk. This followed a bitter dispute, while he was still earl, with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, as to who held precedence within the English peerage; the question was never resolved, but avoided by making Mowbray a duke.

Whilst still a youth Mowbray had been married by his guardian, Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, to Neville&#x27;s eldest daughter, Katherine; Mowbray&#x27;s marriage had cost Westmorland the princely sum of £2,000. John and Katherine had one son, also named John. Mowbray died in 1432, and his heir and namesake, although still a minor, inherited the dukedom. He was to have a relatively short career, although one which made him a significant player in the later Wars of the Roses. Katherine not only survived Mowbray but was to live until 1483, and she took three more husbands before her death, the last of whom, John Woodville, was young enough to be her grandson.

== Youth and early career ==
John Mowbray was born in Calais in 1392. He was the younger of two sons to Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk and his second wife Elizabeth Fitzalan. Thomas Mowbray had died in 1399, and in 1405 John Mowbray&#x27;s elder brother—also named Thomas—rebelled against King Henry IV. The rebellion failed, Thomas was beheaded for treason, and John succeeded to his father&#x27;s earldoms of Norfolk and Nottingham as 5th and 3rd earl respectively. Whilst still only about fifteen in 1407, he was made a ward of his great-aunt Joan, Countess of Hereford (who was also the king&#x27;s mother-in-law). Since she did not live at court, but in Essex (at either the castles of Rochford or Pleshey) it is likely her wards lived with her there (she also had custody of Richard de Vere, heir to the earldom of Oxford). Joan received an annuity to pay for his upkeep which had increased from £100 to £300 by 1410, in which year he left her wardship and became a ward of the king in the royal household. At the same time, even though still a minor, Mowbray began gradually receiving some of his patrimonial estates back from the crown. Thirteen at the time of his brother&#x27;s death, he was made a ward of the Earl of Westmorland in 1411, who paid £2,000 for John&#x27;s custody and marriage. Westmorland was a major northern magnate who had by this time repeatedly supported King Henry against various rebellions in the region.

On 12 January the following year, John married Neville&#x27;s eldest daughter, Katherine. At this time he also received the return of his family&#x27;s hereditary office of Earl Marshal, which had been granted to Westmorland in 1399 on the death of John&#x27;s father. Historian Christine Carpenter has suggested that his restoration was part of Henry V&#x27;s policy of reconciling the families that had rebelled against his father. Chris Given-Wilson has noted that in spite of this spirit of reconciliation, none of the heirs received outright their treacherous fathers&#x27; lands, and that this, therefore, made John Mowbray more likely to be &quot;dependent on the crown&quot; for additional sources of income. G. L. Harriss described Mowbray as &quot;younger than the king and anxious to recover forfeited lands and titles and restore... family honour&quot;.

King Henry IV died in March 1413 and was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Henry V. It was probably at his coronation, on 9 April that year, that Mowbray first exercised his office of Earl Marshal, and as a fee, he was paid with a silver dish, worth approximately twenty-five marks. Furthermore, one of the old King&#x27;s last acts, in early March, had been to restore Mowbray to full seisin of his estates, and to confirm him as Earl of Nottingham. Two days after the king&#x27;s death, the earl was summoned to the parliament for the first time; however, he &quot;continued to badger&quot; the new king, Henry V, for the restoration of his full estates.

== Military service in France ==

=== Under Henry V ===
By the spring of 1414, the new king was publicly reiterating the claim to the French throne that English Kings had traditionally upheld. By April the next year, Mowbray indentured with the King for military service in France, contracting to supply four knights, forty-five men at arms, and 150 archers. On top of military personnel, Mowbray&#x27;s extant accounts indicate that he also had to pay not only for materiél (such as tents, horses, armour, weapons and livery), but for support staff such as surgeons, priests, armourers and cooks. Providing this contingent and other preparations cost him £2,500, of which, eventually, only £1,450 was returned to him in campaign wages. So poor were Mowbray&#x27;s finances at this time that he had had to borrow 1,000 marks from the Earl of Arundel; worse, he had to resort to the &quot;dubious practice&quot; of claiming that innocent—but prosperous—townsmen (from Norwich, for example) were in fact runaway villeins, and effectively blackmailed them with manumission fines. The Agincourt campaign ultimately cost Mowbray £1,000 more than he was paid. The King&#x27;s expedition was due to leave from Southampton in August 1415; just before it did, however, a treasonous plot against Henry V was uncovered, which involved his cousin, Richard, Earl of Cambridge. In his capacity as Earl Marshal, Mowbray led the investigation into the plot on 1 August; four days later he sat in judgement upon them in a trial which ultimately condemned the conspirators to death.

Henry V&#x27;s expeditionary force landed in France on 14 August, and Mowbray took part in the first major engagement, the siege of Harfleur. It was also his last engagement of the campaign—having caught the dysentery that was ravaging the English army, he (and around a quarter of his force and a third of the entire English army) returned to England in October to recover. As a result, John Mowbray was unable to take part in what became the most famous battle of the campaign, at Agincourt, which took place on 25 October soon after he left France. He recuperated at his family seat at Epworth, Lincolnshire, although he had recovered sufficiently by November to travel to London to welcome the victorious Henry V home. Early the following year he also took part in the welcoming committee that greeted the Emperor Sigismund at Dover on his visit to England, which resulted in the Treaty of Canterbury of 1416.

The following year Mowbray again contracted to go to France, this time with a bigger force than before, at 100 men-at-arms and 300 archers; he would not return to England for five years. During this period of the war he took part in some of the major sieges of the campaign, for example, those of Caen, Louviers, and Rouen. In February 1419, he was appointed to the captaincy of two French towns, but it would seem that Henry V—realising that these appointments would keep Mowbray occupied there, and &quot;being apparently unwilling to proceed without his marshal&quot;—cancelled them soon after. As a consequence of this, Mowbray was available to participate in the sieges of Évreux, Vernon, Ivry, Gisors and Melun later that year, the latter of which he played a major role, receiving its surrender in October that year.

In 1420, Mowbray continued with his success in the military; the extent of his activity is indicated by the fact that he had to allow duties in England to pass by. He passed Christmas 1419 with the king at his Rouen base, until March, when he captured the town of Fresnay-le-Vicomte (with John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon), which was followed by the Battle of Le Mans the same month, in which the Dauphin, Charles Valois, was routed. That Christmas he indentured again with the king, this time accepting the captaincy of Pontoise and contracting to provide 60 men-at-arms and 180 archers for the purpose. This appointment—Rowena Archer described it as an &quot;onerous&quot; one—was sufficient to prevent Mowbray from accompanying the King to England. Mowbray was only able to travel with Henry as far as Amiens; the king had just married Katherine of Valois, and they were travelling to England for her coronation. Mowbray should have attended per his office of Earl Marshal; the Earl of Worcester deputised for him. Similarly, when Mowbray was elected to the Order of the Garter, his installation had to be received for him by Rowland Lenthal, later High Sheriff of Hertfordshire.

=== With the Duke of Gloucester ===
What has been described as a &quot;curious&quot; episode in Mowbray&#x27;s career occurred in 1424. Already friends with Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, when the duke decided to invade the county of Hainaut in November that year, Mowbray journeyed with him and acted as his military commander. Little is known of this expedition except that, having raided Brabant, it was probably profitable for Mowbray.

=== Under Henry VI ===
Mowbray was still in France when King Henry returned in 1421, maintaining a front line at Vermandois, Tierche and the Laonnois against La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles. It was only when the king died unexpectedly on 31 August 1422 that the earl returned to England accompanying the corpse. He attended parliament that year, although he was summoned under the name &quot;Thomas&quot;, and Archer posits that that clerical error is indicative of how little, due to his French service, he was known in England. He also joined the royal council that the recent parliament had ordained would govern the country through the new King&#x27;s long minority. Ralph Griffiths has also suggested that Norfolk&#x27;s admission to that body &quot;provided an injection of youth into discussions hitherto conducted by a rather elderly group.&quot;

He was not a particularly regular attendee to the council, and within a year, he had contracted again to serve abroad, on this occasion bringing 115 men-at-arms and 300 archers with Lords Willoughby, Hungerford, and the Duke of Exeter. Although Mowbray did not participate in the Battle of Cravant, which took place on 31 July 1423, he was not inactive; having taken part in so many sieges in his career, he was assisting Jean de Luxembourg in his efforts to relieve Bohain, and later the Lyonnais castle of La Folleye. This campaign appears to have succeeded in its brief of the &quot;protection and defence&quot; of English France, and not only was Normandy almost cleared of enemy forces, the English even managed some &quot;daring sorties&quot; beyond the region.

Although by now a leader of the royal armies in France, Rowena Archer suggests that it was around this time that his martial enthusiasm for royal service began to pale, at least in part because &quot;it had owed much to his personal service to Henry V and to his office as marshal.&quot; But the new King was a baby, and with no further major campaigns taking place during the young king&#x27;s minority, Mowbray&#x27;s office of Earl Marshal was effectively unused. On 19 May 1426, the Duke of Bedford knighted the young king, who in turn dubbed a number of new knights from amongst the heirs of the nobility, including John Mowbray&#x27;s son and namesake.

== Later career and death ==
John Mowbray nearly drowned in the River Thames in November 1428 after his barge capsized after hitting a pier beneath London Bridge; he lost a number of his household in this accident. Mowbray was present in the council that same year which denounced the Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s re-asserted attempt to increase his authority; Mowbray signed his name to an &quot;astonished&quot; memoranda that the duke would think of such a thing when the king was increasingly close to attaining his majority and with it being ready &quot;to occupy his full royal power.&quot;

By May 1429, he had written his first surviving will. The first major occasion on which he performed the office of Marshall again was the king&#x27;s coronation at Westminster. Mowbray also took part in the first major campaign of Henry VI&#x27;s reign which was a direct follow-on from the London coronation. In 1430 it was decided by the King&#x27;s Council to crown Henry in both England, at Westminster Abbey, and then in France, hopefully in Paris. Mowbray contracted to bring a large force of 120 men-at-arms and 360 archers and led the army that accompanied the royal entourage. Mowbray, along with other members of the nobility, acted as both the kernel of the king&#x27;s court and an experienced council while the king was in France. In an attempt to aid the Duke of Burgundy, Norfolk launched an assault on Gournay-sur-Aronde with 1,000 men and likewise took part in other attacks on Dammartin and La Chasse in the Île-de-France. However, he had returned to England before the Paris coronation of Henry in December 1431.

John Mowbray died on 19 October 1432 at Epworth, Lincolnshire, where his father had founded a Cistercian monastery. He had written his second will that same day, and like the first one it requested that his father&#x27;s bones be returned from Venice (where he had died of plague returning from Crusade), and buried on the Isle of Axholme. Mowbray too requested interment there.

== Estates and income ==
Mowbray&#x27;s wealth was adversely affected by his service in France. The Agincourt campaign, for example, cost him around £2,000, the detailed expenditure being recorded by his receiver-general including such purchases as his personal privy seat. In spite of his years of fighting there, however, he had never received any lands or titles based on conquest (although he did manage to sell a large number of French prisoners to Lord Fanhope). Equally affecting his English estates was the fact that substantial dowers were still in the hands of his mother and sister-in-law, Lady Constance Holland (1387–1437) (his brother&#x27;s widow, and daughter of John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter). As K.B. McFarlane put it, his estate was &quot;both wasted and encumbered&quot; from the moment he came into possession On his mother&#x27;s death, however, in 1425, Mowbray received her dower estates concentrated in East Anglia, centred around Framlingham Castle, which he took over, and secured his recognition as duke of Norfolk.

Although he seems never to have been a particularly active Councillor to the King, he nevertheless received 300 marks payment a year for the office, and indeed, even on his deathbed, he was still owed a portion of £1,300 arrears from the government in salary. He had, however, been the first Mowbray to gain possession of the Brotherton and Seagrave estates that had been in the possession of his great-grandmother, Margaret of Brotherton, Duchess of Norfolk, who had died in 1399; and he has been described, after his mother&#x27;s death, as representing &quot;a new nobility&quot; in East Anglia, alongside the Duke of Suffolk. The Brotherton lands particularly have been described as having political potential due to their being a large new conglomerate of estates in a whole new area of influence. As these lands were concentrated in East Anglia, for the first time, a Mowbray Duke of Norfolk had substantially expanded his natural patrimony out of and away from Lincolnshire. The Brotherton lands were worth over £1,400 at the turn of the century, although by the time Mowbray had inherited it, he had two dowagers (the widows of his brother and father) to support out of his income, and they were themselves relatively young

Thus, although he inherited a large estate in East Anglia, it has been estimated that only around half of it was under Mowbray&#x27;s direct control. It may well be as a direct result of his lack of political significance in the region that even though he spent most of his career in France, on his visits home, he spent the majority of his time in London or Epworth, not the east of England.

=== Precedence and the dukedom of Norfolk ===
Throughout his life, Mowbray was obsessed with his &quot;rights and privileges,&quot; even arguing with Henry V over the powers and extent of his office of Earl Marshal. His concern for establishing—and augmenting—his own authority was such that he was drawn in dispute with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick after claiming that his own earldom of Norfolk had precedence in the English peerage, and outranked that of Warwick. Mowbray first claimed precedence in 1414; the situation was not resolved until 1425 when the question was put to parliament. The House of Commons, as Archer puts it, was able to &quot;neatly side-step&quot; the issue by recommending that Mowbray be returned to his family dukedom.

A month later, on 14 July, John Mowbray paid homage to Henry VI as the second Mowbray Duke of Norfolk, which, says Griffiths, was intended to &quot;soothe his offended dignity and quieten the discord&quot;. Having recently fought for the Duke of Gloucester in Brabant, Mowbray relied on the duke&#x27;s support against Beauchamp, who was himself known to be part of Cardinal Beaufort&#x27;s clique.

== Family ==
Mowbray married Lady Katherine Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and had one son, John, born just before his father returned ill from France in 1415. Seventeen-year-old John Mowbray succeeded his father to the dukedom of Norfolk in October 1432, while Katherine lived for over fifty years more and married three more times.

Apart from his elder brother, John Mowbray had three sisters, Elizabeth, Margaret and Isabel. Because of Thomas&#x27; treason, the sisters had to be found husbands in severely straitened circumstances. Elizabeth married Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, although, as K. B. McFarlane noted, his family was, although later ducal, both &quot;impoverished and discredited and also parvenu&quot;, they had no sons.

At some point between 1415 and 1420, Margaret married Sir Robert Howard; their son John was to be an important player in the Wars of the Roses. He was to be a close associate of Mowbray&#x27;s son and heir and also close to King Richard III who was to grant Howard the dukedom of Norfolk in 1483. Isabel married twice: firstly to Sir Henry Ferrers of Groby (&quot;heir of an ancient but minor lordly house&quot;) and latterly, to James Berkeley (&quot;one of two claimants to the headship and depleted lands of another&quot;).

== Character ==
Mowbray&#x27;s most recent biographer, Dr. Rowena Archer, has not overemphasised his positive qualities. She has described his contributions to the political weal as &quot;at best routine, at worst half-hearted,&quot; and notes generally how little he went out of his way to actively participate in domestic politics. Most councils he attended were mostly focused on organising his foreign expeditions; in fact, he &quot;did the minimum amount expected&quot; of him in terms of the running of the country during the king&#x27;s minority.

She does, however, note that being on friendly relations with both the Duke of Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort as he was throughout the king&#x27;s minority, he was active in keeping the peace and arbitrating between them on occasions during their periodic feud. Yet, if he kept the peace between those two men, he was perfectly capable of entering into his own feuds as he showed in November 1428, when he was in a violent dispute with the Earl of Huntingdon. This feud was virulent enough that both lords were removed from the Bedfordshire King’s Bench while the Duke of Gloucester personally investigated the &quot;inveterate feud&quot;.

<doc id="986002" wikidata="Q4866618" url="?curid=986002" title="Baseball positioning">
<text>In baseball and softball, while there are nine named fielding positions, players, with the exception of the pitcher and catcher, may move around freely. The &quot;positioning&quot; for the other seven positions is very flexible, although they all have regular &quot;depths&quot;—distances from home plate, and sometimes lateral positioning. A &quot;shift&quot; means that a player is playing in a noticeably different location than the norm for his positioning. A fielder who is playing &quot;shallow&quot; or &quot;in&quot; is playing closer to home plate, while a player playing &quot;deep&quot; is playing farther from home plate than normal. 

==Common types of positioning==

Regular terms are used for some positionings. For example, &quot;double play depth&quot; is used when there is potential for a force play at second base. This means the shortstop and second baseman are playing slightly closer to second base and sometimes a little bit shallower. This position makes it easier to turn the double play.

The first baseman is said to be &quot;holding the runner&quot; if he positions himself right at first base with one foot on the base, ready to receive a pickoff throw from the pitcher if the runner strays too far from first base between pitches.

&quot;Bringing the corners in&quot; means the first and third baseman are both playing &quot;in&quot; (closer than usual to home plate); this will often be used with runners at third base or when a bunt is anticipated.

The disadvantage of these defensive shifts is that they make more room for the hitter to hit the ball through the gaps for a base hit or lay down a successful bunt too far from any fielder to make a play resulting in an out.

Sometimes in the bottom half of the ninth inning (or later), when a team has a runner on third base in a tie game with less than two outs, the defending team will pull the outfielders in very close, almost creating three extra infielders. This is sometimes known as &quot;do or die&quot; depth. The reason for positioning this way in this situation is that there is no point in having the outfielders playing deep, waiting to catch a fly ball for an out; if they do, the runner at third base will be able to tag up when the ball is caught and then run to home plate to score the winning run. So the outfielders can contribute constructively only by filling the gaps between the infielders.

===Infield shift===

Some extreme repositioning known as a shift was used against pull hitters, a strategy that became more prevalent in Major League Baseball since the late-2000s. For example, versus excellent left-handed pull-hitters like Ted Williams, David Ortiz, Joey Gallo and Ryan Howard, teams would move more players to the right side of the field. They would sometimes play with the shortstop behind or even to the right of second base. The second baseman may simply move to the right, in which case this just qualifies as a shift, or he might move deeper into shallow right field. Another variation had the third baseman move to where the shortstop would play in the shift, leaving the shortstop (who is generally the team&#x27;s best infielder) to cover the left side of the infield.

Many believe that this shift was first employed against Ted Williams in the 1940s, as thought up by then-Indians manager Lou Boudreau. However, it was first used against Cy Williams in the 1920s.

The infield shift was restricted by MLB beginning in the 2023 season.

<text>The Andreanof Islands (, ) are a group of islands in the Aleutian Islands in southwestern Alaska, United States. They are located at about 52° North and 172°57&#x27; to 179°09&#x27; West.

==Geography==
The Andreanof Islands are located between Amchitka Pass and the Rat Islands group to the west, and Amukta Pass and the Islands of Four Mountains group to the east. The islands extend about 275 miles (440 km). The total land area of all islands (including the Delarof Islands) is 1,515.349 sq mi (3,924.737 km2).

The total population was 412 persons as of the 2000 census, the vast majority in the city of Adak on Adak Island.

===Islands===
The Delarof Islands are a subgroup of the Andreanof Islands group as well as the westernmost islands in the group.

The largest islands in the group are, from west to east, Gareloi Island, Tanaga Island, Kanaga, Adak Island, Kagalaska Island, Great Sitkin Island, Atka Island, Amlia, and Seguam Island.

The islands are usually foggy and treeless because of the almost constant wind.

==History==
The Andreanof Islands were named after the Russian navigator, Andreyan (Hadrian) Tolstykh, who was the first European to explore the islands in 1761.

There were several United States military bases on the islands during World War II. The bases on Adak were enlarged and made permanent after the war but were closed in 1995.

<text>The , officially the ; sometimes abbreviated JSA or NSK, and more usually called Sumo Kyōkai, is the governing body that operates and controls professional sumo wrestling, called , in Japan under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). 

Concretely, the association maintains and develops sumo traditions and integrity by holding tournaments and . The purposes of the association are also to develop the means dedicated to the sport and maintain, manage and operate the facilities necessary for these activities. Therefore, the JSA operates subsidiaries such as the Kokugikan Service Company to organize its economic aspects, the Sumo School to organize training and instruction or the Sumo Museum to preserve and utilize sumo wrestling records and artefacts.

Though professionals, such as active wrestlers, referees, hairdressers and ushers, are all on the association&#x27;s payroll, leadership positions are restricted to retired wrestlers. The organization has its headquarters in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan arena, in Sumida, Tokyo.

The association&#x27;s culture is based on respect for the law and continuity of sumo&#x27;s traditions, deeply rooted in Japan&#x27;s history and Shinto religion. It has a reputation for secrecy. In response to a number of scandals, the association has implemented numerous reforms in recent decades.

==History==

===Beginnings of organizations===
The association has its origins in a Shinto ritual (or festival) that has been held since ancient times to pray for a bountiful harvest. This primary form of sumo was called . During the Sengoku period, Oda Nobunaga made sumo a popular sport, aided by the emergence of large cities (like Edo, Osaka, Sendai and Nagoya), which soon began to compete with Kyoto&#x27;s cultural monopoly, as it was Japan&#x27;s only metropolis at the time. These new cultural centres saw the emergence of wrestling groups, from both the commoners and the warrior classes, who took part in festivities at shrines. During the Edo period, sumo bouts, called , were often held to raise funds to develop provinces (new construction or repair of bridges, temples, shrines and other public buildings) or for entertainment purposes.

After the Sengoku period, during the period of peace established under the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan experienced an unprecedented period of vagrancy for many samurai who had lost their social standing (called ). These masterless samurai, began to be organized in two extremes that coexisted side by side. On the one hand, certain powerful clans formed suites of wrestlers organized into veritable royal households called , and elevated them to the status of vassals. On the other hand, a number of had no choice but to put their martial skills to good use in street sumo tournaments, called , for the entertainment of passers-by. Similarly, a number of street entertainment wrestling groups formed and began touring, sometimes with the support of shrines that occasionally recruited them as part of religious festivities and to help priests raising money for the construction of buildings. Eventually, this mix of professional wrestlers and disgraced , along with the commoners who took part in the contests of strength of the street tournaments, created conflicts over money. Tense brawls, even deaths, sometimes occurred. Public order became so disturbed that in 1648 the Edo authorities issued an edict banning street sumo and matches organized to raise funds during festivities. Over the next two decades or so, the wrestlers, now without any income, decided to petition the authorities to lift the bans, forming informal associations that resembled coalitions of interests to protect themselves from any violent repression of their movement. In 1684, these movements bore fruit and a by the name of obtained permission to hold a tournament after proposing a new etiquette associated with tournaments. The organization of tournaments began to depend more on groups following new standards designed to satisfy the authorities of the towns hosting them. These associations gradually came to depend on the influence of retired former wrestlers who began to organize tournaments.

At that time, the Edo-based association (although composed of elders as today) was organized in such a way as to be dominated by a duo of executives, the , the director, and the , his second. The composition of the and its hierarchy was primarily their decision, and conflicts of interest were common. In addition, the profits from the tournaments were first divided among them before a portion was given to the other elders, who in turn distributed the money to their disciples. Because of the filtering of high-ranking managers, little money reached the bottom of the ladder, and this system was only tolerated because the patronage of local lords also added extra salaries for high-ranking wrestlers.

===The foundations of the current association===
Wrestlers who took part in these authorised tournaments without the patronage of lords did not yet have samurai status or a salary and their finances depended largely on donations they could receive from the organisers of charity tournaments or admirers. The organisers also ensured that they were fed and housed for the duration of the tournament. In those days the promotion system was decided by the tournament organisers, who then distributed the profits to the elders who then redistributed funds to their wrestlers, with the wrestlers under the protection of the lords receiving bonuses and having financial security and the others being kept in a situation of poverty. In 1757, during the Hōreki era, the beginnings of the Japan Sumo Associations were formally established as , later called . In 1869, the was founded. Each associations had their own history and changes. For example, from 1888 to 1895 the , led by wrestlers Ōnaruto and Shingari, broke off from Osaka-sumo. In 1897, these movements led to reforms in the Osaka-based association, which became the .

From 1789, the Edo-based association began to incorporate religious practices into the sport, under the guidance of the House of Yoshida Tsukasa and the status of was created in Edo. In the 1870s, the first wrestlers&#x27; revolt was organized by Takasago Uragorō asking for better treatment for the wrestlers (without initial success) and created a split from the Tokyo-based association before merging again. The Meiji Restoration was a period of semi-censorship of sumo, with the adoption of Western ideology leading to the perception of sumo as unworthy of the new era, as the matches were seen as barbaric and the semi-nudity of the wrestlers shocking. With the disappearance of government protection, the association found it difficult to keep up the number of wrestlers. At the same time, political circles were organized to preserve some of Japan&#x27;s indigenous traditions, saving on behalf of the association the privilege of wrestlers to wear samurai (topknot) in 1871. The nobility introduced changes to the way tournaments were organised, reforming the way winnings were distributed and creating the status of association director. In an effort to change its image, the changed its name to in 1889. The internal reforms carried out at the time included the election of directors, the creation of a fixed income for wrestlers and a change in refereeing decisions from to . During the same year, the Tokyo Ōzumō began to think about a project to install an arena at Hibiya Park to hold its bouts indoors, but the project was abandoned for lack of funds. In 1909, the association founded its first arena by inaugurating the first Ryōgoku Kokugikan, in order to avoid having to depend on the weather for tournaments held at the Ekō-in temple. Social movements in sumo did not cease, however, and in 1911 a strike called the organized by low-ranking wrestlers asked for a new wage reform, securing a bonus (made up of payment in cash and a deposit in a pension fund) distributed to all wrestlers who were not or . In 1923, another strike known as the demanded better pensions for wrestlers and was led by Ōnishiki, without success. In the same year, the first Kokugikan was ravaged by fire following the Great Kantō earthquake and most of the association&#x27;s archives were lost.

Gradually, the Tokyo-based sumo association became dominant. In April 1925, Prince-Regent Hirohito invited the Tokyo Sumo Association to hold a tournament at the Imperial Palace, with the implied aim of also featuring wrestlers from the Osaka-based association. During the tournament, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup (then the Prince-Regent&#x27;s Cup) was awarded for the first time. Under the impetus of this tournament, a joint competition plan with a common banzuke was proposed, concluding talks that had been taking place since the early 1920s to merge the two rival associations. To establish a ranking according to the wrestlers&#x27; skills, qualifying tournaments were organized in November 1925 and in March and October 1926. The March 1926 tournament was officially recognised as the first modern (professional sumo championship tournament). During the same period, on 28 December 1925, the became the , an organization now recognised as the first incarnation of today&#x27;s association.

===Merger and final recognition===
As a result of the qualifying tournaments, the Osaka-based association lost many top-ranked wrestlers who found themselves demoted in the rankings, although Miyagiyama (the top ranked wrestler in Osaka) was able to retain his position. During tournaments, Osaka&#x27;s wrestlers were regularly outclassed by their Tokyo counterparts, with some wrestlers ranked as or in Osaka even struggling against Tokyo&#x27;s or . Later in 1925, the first chairman of the association, Lieutenant-General , was named.

In January 1927, the Osaka-based sumo association officially merged with the All Japan Sumo Association after a long decline. It saved face in the first tournament after the merger of the two associations, as the championship was won by Miyagiyama. The association formally acquired the status of nonprofit organization, and was placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, since in Japan this type of organization requires registration with a government institution.

In 1932, the last major wrestlers&#x27; strike broke out with the Shunjuen Incident, calling for fundamental reform of the Sumo Association and leading to a mass resignation of wrestlers the likes of which professional sumo had never seen before. From 1933 to 1937, the All Japan Sumo Association briefly experienced a secession leading to the foundation of the by members of the Dewanoumi . The secessionist association later dissolved, but never had the association been so close to destruction.

In 1944, the first successor from the sumo world was chosen and Dewanoumi (the former Tsunenohana) became chairman of the association. After the war, the association was further modernized, in particular to maintain the sport in the context of the &quot; ban&quot; (a ban enforced on the practice of combat training disguised as martial arts gatherings by the authoritarian government) applied by the Allied forces. Thanks to the efforts of Musashigawa (the former Dewanohana) and Kasagiyama Katsuichi (a wrestler who spoke a little English), the association succeeded in convincing the Americans of the tournaments&#x27; good faith, and the first to be held after the war was in November 1945. Since the tournaments were later expropriated from the original Kokugikan for use by soldiers as &quot;Memorial Hall&quot;, the association moved its headquarters to the Meiji Shrine in June 1947. In 1950, following a scandal involving the withdrawal from competition of the three of the time (Azumafuji, Terukuni and Haguroyama) the association considered demoting the highest-ranking sumo wrestlers in the event of a poor score or consecutive absence from two tournaments, but decided to back down following pressure from traditionalists and purists. Common ground was found and the Yokozuna Deliberation Council was created, definitively detaching the association from the House of Yoshida, and declaring that the appointment of would henceforth be based on recommendations from the board of directors and the new committee. In 1954, the association moved its headquarters to the Kuramae Kokugikan.

The modernizations launched after the war were also notably introduced in response to a scandal highlighting the management of the association&#x27;s missions and funds. In 1957, a special commission of the National Diet investigated the improper use of money by the association due to the general inability of the public to reserve seats for tournaments, in opposition to its non-profit status. In those days, the reservation system was mainly based on private teahouses, which gave patrons privileged access to tournaments. The scandal erupted when it was revealed that the wife and daughter of the then chairman, Dewanoumi, were running two of the biggest houses. The Diet also considered the association&#x27;s missions, based on the testimonies of former Tenryū Saburō (former leader of the Shunjuen Incident) and (former director of the association under the name Sadogatake). The association was further criticized for failing in its duties as a public interest corporation, notably on the subject of sumo teaching, by favoring the pursuit of profit. To sidestep the debate, the association founded the Sumo School to teach its recruits the basics of sumo. Since he was personally blamed for the management problems, Dewanoumi tried to commit suicide by . He was replaced by Tokitsukaze (former Futabayama) who began a series of reforms. Under his chairmanship, the teahouse system was reformed, with 40% of places now reserved for direct purchase, and the system placed under a commercial company directly dependent on the association. In 1958, the association took its definitive name by being renamed &quot;Japan Sumo Association&quot;.

===Modern times===

In March 1968, the association&#x27;s statutes were amended to restrict board membership to , high-ranking wrestlers and . The number of directors was also limited to ten elders after negotiations between the five . 

In the 1970&#x27;s, the association opened up more officially to foreign wrestlers, which led to reflection on the possibility of these wrestlers remaining in the association after retirement. More specifically, the case of Hawaiian wrestler Takamiyama in 1976 provoked a conservative reaction from the association, which declared that sumo being Japan&#x27;s national sport, it was inconceivable that a foreigner could participate as a trainer. The statement was subsequently severely criticized in the press. This led the association to correct its position in this regard, with the JSA subsequently declaring that Takamiyama and Kaneshiro (a Japanese sumo wrestler of Korean descent) would indeed be eligible to become coaches within the association after their retirements. Takamiyama was the first to retire, becoming a coach under the name Azumazeki, the first foreign-born sumo wrestler to do so. 

In 1985, the association once again moved its headquarters and inaugurated the second Ryōgoku Kokugikan, acquiring the land by purchasing it from Japan National Railways.

In the early 1990s, an internal debate also shook the association over the fact that a foreign wrestler could become . In 1992, a member of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, Kojima Jo, was quoted in the magazine Bungei Shunjū as opposing the appointment of foreigners, who he felt were too far removed from the (), the &#x27;dignity&#x27;, needed to become one of professional sumo&#x27;s top ranked wrestler. However, other members of the council and the association maintained that they would consider a promotion if its conditions were met, regardless of who the wrestler was. Further controversy arose when &quot;The Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; reported that Konishiki, at the time the foreigner closest to promotion, had alleged racial discrimination was the reason for his being denied promotion. &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently quoted Konishiki as saying, &quot;If I were Japanese, I would be already&quot;. The association demanded an apology and Konishiki held a press conference during which he tearfully denied making the remarks. He insisted that &quot;The Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; had misinterpreted his remark, and that he had not spoken to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and instead a Hawaiian apprentice Koryū had impersonated him on the telephone. In 1993, Akebono, a student of Azumazeki (former Takamiyama), became the first foreign-born in the history of the sport.

===Scandals prompting a reform era===
Between 2007 and 2008, two scandals hit the association (the Tokitsukaze stable hazing scandal and the cannabis use scandal) leading to the resignation of chairman Kitanoumi in September 2008 and the appointment of Musashigawa (the former Mienoumi). In a move to increase transparency, the MEXT (under Vice-minister Kenshiro Matsunami) demanded the opening of the Sumo Association&#x27;s board of directors to external auditors, introducing non- personalities into the decision-making system for the first time in 63 years. At the time, the association&#x27;s statutes clearly stated that only former wrestlers could sit on the board of directors but Vice-minister Matsunami insisted that the scandal was &quot;the biggest disgrace in the history of sumo&quot;. Some internal voices argued that new blood was needed, opposing the appointment of then-chairman of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, . The new members of the Board were three auditors: Itō Shigeru (Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo), (lawyer and former Prosecutor General of the Tokyo Prosecutors&#x27; Office) and Jun Yoshino (former Police Commissioner). Although the internal organization was changed following the scandal, the external auditors are not given voting rights on the board and their position is only part-time.

During the 2010s, the association was also marked by the revelation of numerous scandals linked to its opaque organization. These scandals included wrestlers&#x27; links with organised crime and gambling, which is illegal in Japan. The violent nature of training and the legitimacy of violence within the traditional hierarchy of wrestlers was also called into question. Between 2010 and 2011, the association had to deal with the ties of several wrestlers in all divisions to organized crime. The scandal came to light in January when Kotomitsuki was reported in a &quot;Shūkan Shinchō&quot; article on 19 January as having participated in gambling circles run by . Although initially denied, the link between the and several members of the association was established over the course of the year. The scandal triggered a public outcry that flooded the association&#x27;s switchboard with complaints and protests, and demonstrations were organized in front of the association&#x27;s headquarters at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan. In order to satisfy requests for internal investigations and changes, the association dissolved its Life Guidance Committee, appointing a new committee made up of young elders between 30 and 45 years of age, headed by Michinoku (the former Kirishima). Chairman Musashigawa also resigned from his position in July, and was succeeded at the head of the association by Murayama Hiroyoshi, a lawyer who had previously been appointed auditor of the association in 2008, and who held the position of acting chairman until the beginning of August. At one point, the revelation of collusion between wrestlers and was such that MEXT threatened to dissolve the association&#x27;s public non-profit institution act and confiscate the JSA&#x27;s properties, including the Ryōgoku Kokugikan. In this context, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano also declared that negotiations between the association and the ministry on acquiring status could fail, threatening the association with colossal financial losses, since other foundation statutes in Japan do not offer tax benefits. At the time, the association was involved in negotiations with the ministry to bring its statutes into line with the requirements of a law on public establishments passed in 2008, initially with the aim of achieving this status by the end of November 2013. The crisis, described as the most serious in sumo history, was such that several comments emerged on the fact that the damage could well threaten sumo&#x27;s recognized position as Japan&#x27;s national sport.

Chairman Musashigawa had to resign, and Hanaregoma (the former Kaiketsu) was appointed in his place with his presidency being tarnished by a match-fixing scandal that broke in February 2011. Under his impetus, the association initially reacted swiftly by cancelling the in Osaka outright. However, the association&#x27;s handling of the scandal soon came under criticism, particularly Hanaregoma&#x27;s statement that there had never been match-fixing in sumo before. Despite the scandal, Hanaregoma succeeded in bringing negotiations on the status of the Public Interest Incorporated Foundation to a successful conclusion. Having reached the age limit of 65, Hanaregoma promptly resigned his post and Kitanoumi was elected for a second time to the head of the association, becoming the first chairman to return to this level of responsibility in the association&#x27;s history. Despite the criticism, Hanaregoma&#x27;s commitment during the crisis was hailed for running the association as a man of integrity, respected under the nickname .

In January 2014, the association shifted to a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation and officially changed its name to . The change, effectively implemented from March to coincide with new board of directors elections, had been delayed for a year following complicated negotiations over the status of and the composition of the board. In order to bring the statutes of the association into line with the stipulations of the incorporated foundations was introduced the , responsible for monitoring the shared interests of the ministry and the association. That council is made up equally of three retired (elders with no re-employment) elected within the association and four personalities appointed by the ministry. Their rank equals that of a director to the association&#x27;s board. Elders on the committee are not allowed to concurrently serve as because of the committee authority that allows them to have a say in the appointment and dismissal of directors. Each counselor serves a term of four years. Also incorporated were bans on the purchase of names and the widespread expulsion of employees who failed to comply with the association&#x27;s rules.

In November 2015, the chairman of the association, Kitanoumi, passed away and an official funeral was held at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan by the JSA in December under the chairmanship of Hakkaku (former Hokutoumi), with around 2,500 people attending. During the same month, the board of directors appointed Hakkaku as chairman of the association, a position he had already held on an interim basis since Kitanoumi&#x27;s death. Kitanoumi&#x27;s sudden death launched an election in March 2016, described as &quot;fierce&quot; by the press. After negotiations for the positions of director and chairman, Hakkaku was elected head of the association, ahead of his main rival Takanohana.

In November 2017, the issue of violence scandals resurfaced within the association with &quot;Sports Nippon&quot;&#x27;s revelations about Takanoiwa&#x27;s assault by Harumafuji. The incident generated intense media coverage, prompted by the previous scandals and the change in the association&#x27;s nature to an incorporated non-profit foundation. The association&#x27;s reaction was also heavily criticized, with some newspapers condemning a discourse that made excuses for the aggressor. In April 2018, the association&#x27;s conduct was also criticized after women tried to come to the assistance of the mayor of Maizuru (Ryoto Tatami), who had collapsed in the ring. Since women are considered impure and are not allowed enter the ring, a (referee) ordered them to leave it despite the medical emergency. The incident triggered criticism from the public and from the Minister in charge of Women&#x27;s Empowerment, Seiko Noda, forcing the association to publicly apologize.

===2020s===
The COVID-19 pandemic in Japan forced the March 2020 tournament in Osaka to be held behind closed doors. The last time this occurred was in the June 1945 tournament, when only injured Pacific War veterans were invited to attend. This was followed by the cancellation of the May tournament. As a result, the association in 2021 had a deficit of 6.3 billion yen, the biggest in its history. The association&#x27;s finances recovered by March 2024, with a surplus of 300 million yen.

Also in 2020, the association, along with Nippon Professional Baseball and the , withdrew from the . This occurred after the Cabinet Office issued a recommendation urging the Japan Professional Sports Association to reform its internal organization, which was inadequate to supervise other public interest incorporated foundations.

In 2022, for the first time in its history, the association signed a partnership agreement with a local government, Sumida Ward, to revitalize the district by encouraging sumo wrestlers to visit schools, and promote sport and tourism.

In December 2023, the sent the association a rare demand letter for unpaid overtime owed to its administrative staff. Between June and October 2023, the association had also been the subject of five investigations, a rare number for a public interest incorporated foundation. In addition, the association was criticized for managerial problems, which led to moral harassment and the suspension of three administrative executives in September, without the situation changing according to the daily &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot;.

==Organization==
The Japan Sumo Association is a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation since 2014. Therefore, its functioning is of a non-profit organization and its activities are regulated through a top-down system of government supervision, as well as adherence to strict establishment conditions in exchange of preferential treatments under the Japanese tax system. In practice, this means that the association is exempt from taxes, with the exception of consumption, business and property taxes. Although the association is a foundation, it has borrowed particularities from the statutes of corporations. The association&#x27;s operations are authorized and defined by the administrative agency of the Act on Authorization of Public Interest Incorporated Associations and Public Interest Incorporated Foundation (Act No. 49 of 2006).

Professor Mark D. West defined the organization of the Association as a &quot;complex&quot; balance of legal rules and informal social norms, referring to both the respect for the law as well as the rules nominally approved by the Ministry of Education, as sumo&#x27;s supervising agency; and the traditional constraints not enforceable by law, inherited from the long history of sumo as a sport and the history of the association. The association&#x27;s choice to apply rules or to defect to norms is based on efficiency. In addition to this balance, the association maintains a culture of discretion and secrecy in its management of professional sumo. According to West, the reasons for this secrecy are mainly to control the flow of information, whether negative (scandal) or positive (promotion of a popular wrestler). Such control maintains the positive image of the sport and the mystical culture built up by sumo, linked to its religious roots.

===The system===

The Japan Sumo Association relations between its members are primarily shaped by rules and norms related to the ownership and transfer of &quot;elder stocks&quot;, or shares, held by the association elders. Of all the employees of the association only they can manage the organization. Each share is associated with a particular name, and in the sumo world the former wrestler will be known by that name, usually with the suffix . The members are also often called elders in English.

Former wrestlers gain the right to participate in the management of the association by inheriting a share (called a ), of which there are 105. The value of these shares was extremely high and rules only permits former sumo wrestlers who either reached at least a rank ( or higher) or been ranked for a significant number of tournaments as a to inherit them. Japanese citizenship is also a prerequisite. Retired wrestlers may own several shares at the same time and exchange or loan them, often in order to inherit a name that affiliates them with a particular stable or tradition. The association delegates the selection of the wrestlers who can inherits these shares to former shareholders who, by tradition, retain the power to choose their successors. It however have a say in the transmission, mainly to ensure that eligibility requirements are met, ensuring that only the best wrestlers can in turn become coaches. The association also manages the shares of deceased or definitively-retired former members that have not been reallocated after a five-year period.

Before the association became a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation, the elder shares were to be purchased and there was a highly speculative market, which prevented many wrestlers from remaining in the association because the price of a share was too high. At the end of the 90s, this value was around 100 to 400 million yen. Since the introduction of the Japan Sumo Association as a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation, the shares are technically no longer purchasable, but rather managed by the Association. Normally, if money is exchanged as part of the inheritance of a share, the appointment of the new holder may be invalidated and the offender subjected to disciplinary measures, up to and including expulsion from the association. However, the monetization of the shares&#x27; inheritance still seems to be tolerated by the association.

An exception to the normal acquisition is made for the most successful , with era-defining being offered a &quot;single generation&quot; or &quot;lifetime&quot; elder stock, called . This process allows the wrestler to stay as an elder without having to use a traditional share in the association, and enter his retirement duties with his ring name. This exception system has been offered to three former wrestlers : Taihō, Kitanoumi and Takanohana. A fourth, Chiyonofuji, was offered this status but preferred a normal share and became known as Kokonoe. These four all achieved more than twenty tournament championships in their active careers. In October 2021, Hakuhō, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup number record holder, was however denied the and Masayuki Yamauchi (a Yokozuna Deliberation Council member) declared to a press conference that &quot;no such system exists&quot; under the new Public Interest Incorporated Foundation statutes of the association, implying that the system would no longer be used.

The elders of the Association receive a salary that depends on their rank within the association. They are expected to assist in the running of both their stable, called in Japanese (but changed to as a suffix) and the association. They do this by performing a diversity of tasks, from selling tickets and security work at the most junior level, to taking charge of one of the Association departments as a director.

These members are also the only persons given the authority to train new sumo wrestlers. They do this by opening or taking over stable, which will take the same name as the founder&#x27;s elder name. Thus someone known as Dewanoumi is the owner of Dewanoumi stable. A few coaches have their own stable, while the rest are required to be affiliated with one and assist the principal owner. It is common for the most senior members of the Association to concentrate on their Association responsibilities and pass the day-to-day management of a stable to another. If a senior coach wishes to do this, the two may elect to swap names so that the stable can keep the more prestigious name. Examples include, when the Association&#x27;s chairman Dewanoumi (former Sadanoyama), swapped names with Sakaigawa (former Washūyama) who took over the running of Dewanoumi stable in 1996, or the transfer of the elder share &quot;Kokonoe&quot; from former Kitanofuji to former Chiyonofuji in exchange for the title &quot;Jinmaku&quot;, allowing Chiyonofuji to inherit Kokonoe stable in 1992.

All members are required to retire when they reach the age of sixty-five (with a possible five-year extension if approved by the board of directors), after which they can pass their name to another, provided that person meets the association&#x27;s eligibility requirements. In the case of a lifetime share mentioned above, the name merely lapses.

===Other personnel===

The association employs a certain number of other personnel, mainly to assist in the running of tournaments. Therefore, auxiliary personnel such as (referees), (ushers) and (hairdressers) are all employees of the association. In contrast to wrestlers, all members employed in these roles may generally stay in the association until retirement age. The association provides their training, usually conducted by seniors in their field of activity, and ranks them. Before the association&#x27;s transition to the Public Interest Incorporated Foundation, the two highest-ranking (called ) were on the association&#x27;s board along with the .

In addition, a limited number of positions do exist for retired wrestlers who did not fulfill the requirements for inheriting a , and would otherwise have to leave the sumo world upon their retirement from active competition. These former wrestlers are kept within the association as contract employees, customarily retaining their old as their professional name, and are employed to handle various tasks. They are separated into two distinct roles:
*Up to eight , or &quot;youth leaders&quot;, serving as officials of the association. They typically work at their former stables or within the associated . are tasked with arranging matches and supervising young sumo wrestlers from makushita and below. They also appear in public next to the during the closing ceremony, receiving the trophies given to the tournament winner to return them backstage.

*Up to thirteen , or &quot;caretakers&quot;, work as transportation and storage managers, handling association equipment used for tournaments and . In addition they deal with miscellaneous, primarily physical tasks, as instructed by the master of the stable they belong to, or other association members (including ).

==Missions==

The JSA is more than just a sports organization. Its status as an Incorporated Foundation makes it an organization of cultural purpose. However, the complex structure of the association means that it carries out its missions as both a company involved in promoting sport, in particular by selling tickets for tournaments, and as a cultural entity due to its historical links with the Shinto religion and its links with the imperial family, which is also responsible for training its young students. 

In order to maintain and develop the traditions and order of Sumo, the association is mainly responsible for holding competitive tournaments (called ) in January, March, May, July, September and November. The association also holds regional tours (called ). The Japan Sumo Association holds these tournaments each year with different purposes for each kind. Main tournaments are televised and help to maintain the interest of sumo as a sport by broadcasting the competitions. The meanwhile are important for the popularity of wrestlers and allow fans to meet them in the form of meet and greet events.

The association is also responsible for the recruitment, instruction and training of wrestlers via the system or the Sumo School. Although not all wrestlers are salaried (only ranked wrestlers are), the association provides a small allowance to all of them. Depending on the wrestler&#x27;s performance during tournaments, the association is also responsible of the wrestlers ranking. As wrestlers are not the only employees of the association, it also oversees the recruitment of , and to maintain the traditional settings of Sumo. Non-traditional occupations are also the responsibility of the association, in particular to maintain the operation of businesses linked to the association (such as the Kokugikan sales department, the restaurant or the skewer factory).

Bearing the responsibility of the sport&#x27;s long history, the association oversees the preservation and utilization of sumo archives. It also collects various types of objects linked to sumo wrestlers (such as , or belts) which are stored and exhibited in the Sumo Museum.

==Departments==
===Association organization===
The association is ruled by a series of departments and committees into which the are divided when they enter their new career as coaches. The association&#x27;s departments are organised as follows:

===Advisory body===

To this organization adds an advisory body called the Yokozuna Deliberation Council.

==Elections==

The possession of a is essential for the functioning of association as elders, assembled in a board of trustees called , votes for the board of the association. Elections are held in even-numbered years or every two years, usually in January or February.

The election process is heavily influenced by the stables regroupments to which coaches are distributed in. Each stable belong to an , or clan. There are currently five , each bearing the name of its leading stable: Dewanoumi, Isegahama, Nishonoseki, Takasago and Tokitsukaze. The serves as quasi-political groupings, each clan nominating candidates for the ten positions or so that are available on the association&#x27;s board each election cycle. Each vote is normally along the interests of the , which explain why the bigger clans more often holds the association&#x27;s chairmanship. Former wrestler popularity however plays a role in the credit given to an application. For example, former Takanohana won four straight election bids to become director before his demotion in 2018, despite being the leader of a (now dissolved) small . 

Stables aren&#x27;t equally divided among the . As of July 2024, Nishonoseki has the most stables with 17, but Dewanoumi has the most affiliated (elders) with 37.

As in the political world intrigue, subterfuge, splits and new coalitions are ordinary. The have a lot of leeway and can decide many things on their own. In fact, some elders change stables, move their stable to different or break off from their clan. For example, the Kokonoe stable was founded in 1967 after Chiyonoyama failed to gain control of the Dewanoumi stable. The break off that ensued saw the stable leaving the Dewanoumi to join the Takasago . Also, in 2010, Takanohana stable (run under the &quot;lifetime share&quot; system by the eponymous) broke off from the Nishonoseki (with Ōnomatsu stable, Ōtake stable and Magaki stable) as he wanted to present himself to the board&#x27;s election and his clan would not permit it. He became the leader of its own group, which was then formally recognized as an (called Takanohana ) in 2014. The was however short lived and was disbanded in 2018 after the Takanoiwa affair. Until 2018, there have been non-aligned stables, or loose coalitions that weren&#x27;t formal , but in 2018 the association ruled that all stables had to belong to one of the current .

==Board of the Association==
The Japan Sumo Association&#x27;s board is composed of a board of directors, under which several deputy directors and special executives operate, namely three vice-directors and a .

The board of directors elects a chairman, called , from among themselves. Directors other than the chairman serve as department heads. Among them, the role of Operations director is considered to be the association&#x27;s number 2. Each board member serves a two-year term.

Directors, called , are elected by a single anonymous vote by all the elders, assembled in a board of trustees called , from candidates selected among the . Since 1968, the number of directors on the board has been limited to ten elders. Prior to 2014, four active sumo wrestlers serving as representatives and both the had the right to sit on the board and vote, but with the transition to a public interest incorporated foundation both wrestlers and referees lost their right to be on the board.

In the wake of scandals, reforms were undertaken to better supervise the decisions of the Board of Directors, introducing two entities into the management of the association. In September 2008, three external directors were appointed at the Ministry of Education&#x27;s insistence. One of the three, , also served as acting chairman for the July 2010 tournament while the then head, Musashigawa (former Mienoumi), was suspended.

A counselor committee was introduced in 2014 to facilitate dialogue between the ministry and the association. This committee, called , is made up equally of retired wrestlers (with no re-employment) elected within the association and personalities appointed by the ministry. Their rank equals that of a director to the association&#x27;s board. Elders on the committee are not allowed to concurrently serve as because of the committee authority that allows them to have a say in the appointment and dismissal of directors. Each counselor serves a term of four years. Having the task of &quot;overseeing the execution of duties by the directors&quot;, auditors may attend meetings of the board of directors and the Board of Trustees, but have no voting rights. Former association-elected members who decide to return to the association after their term on the may do so after being auditioned by a reviewing committee.

The current Board of Directors is composed as follows (as of March 2024):

==Controversies==
In the decade from 2007 to 2017, the association had to deal with a number of affairs like the Tokitsukaze stable disciple assault death case (2007), the case of foreign sumo wrestlers possessing and smoking cannabis (2008), the baseball gambling and match-fixing scandal (2010-2011), Harumafuji&#x27;s assault incident (2017) and the ban on women. While the association had always benefited from leniency on a certain number of its practices, the evolutions of Japanese society and the ever more frequent media coverage of the scandals surrounding the association contributed to the reaction of the latter and to the establishment of reforms in this world yet governed by immutable rules.

===Links with criminals===
In 2010, the Japan Sumo Association announced its decision to dismiss Kotomitsuki and Ōtake (former Takatōriki), for betting on baseball games in a gambling ring run by the . At the same time, two stable masters were demoted and an unprecedented 18 wrestlers banned from the July 2010 tournament. Sumo Association chairman Hanaregoma declared in August 2010 that &quot;violent groups or antisocial forces&quot; were being banned from accessing tournament venues, training stables and other facilities. The association issued a statement on the matter, stating &quot;the Japan Sumo Association are aware of their social responsibility and declare that they will work to eliminate anti-social forces such as organized crime groups&quot;. Since then, members of organized crime groups are not allowed in sumo venues (such as the Ryōgoku Kokugikan), stables, supporters&#x27; associations and celebrations.

===Unequal treatments and accusation of racism===
As the association have the mission to perpetuate sumo traditions, a certain number of its practices and comments are often seen as dated. The treatment of injured wrestlers is often pointed out as unfair. In recent times, both Hakuhō and Kakuryū drove criticism from the Yokozuna Deliberation Council for extended periods where they sat out tournaments due to injury. However, in the meantime, injured Japanese Kisenosato did not get any critics and rather had encouragement from the council. The difference of treatment prompted criticism on the supposed preferential treatment.

The inequality of treatment between wrestlers also drove suspicion of racism within the institution. The controversy arose when &quot;The Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; reported that Samoan-born Konishiki had alleged racial discrimination was the reason for him being denied promotion to sumo&#x27;s top rank of . &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently quoted Konishiki as saying, &quot;If I were Japanese, I would be already.&quot; The Japan Sumo Association demanded an apology. Konishiki held a press conference during which he made his apology and tearfully denied making the remarks.

More recently, during the retirement of era defining Hakuhō , the &quot;Experts&#x27; Meeting on the Succession and Development of Grand Sumo&quot; (directed by Yamauchi Masayuki, a member of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council), which the Japan Sumo Association consulted on how sumo should be in response to the new era, suddenly came up with a proposal for &quot;the abolition of the .&quot; The reason mentioned was that &quot;there is no provision in the articles of incorporation of the association that serves as a basis.&quot; The association faced severe criticism in particular on the basis of previous suspicions of racism. However it is assumed the decision was taken to prevent the rise of another Takanohana controversy by giving a wrestler too much prestige.

===Violence and hazing===
Sumo stables were well known for their systematic hazing and physical punishment of young disciples in order to &quot;toughen them up&quot;. Stablemasters have often been proud to show to the media how they frequently use a to beat those who fall out of line, and elder wrestlers are often put in charge of bullying younger ones to keep them in line, for instance, by making them hold heavy objects for long periods of time. Also, the strict sumo hierarchy where senior and high-ranking wrestlers take responsibility to train their juniors often led to violence as in sumo the rank is a symbol of status.

The system of hazing was widely criticized in late 2007. A hazing scandal was exposed in which a Tokitsukaze stable&#x27;s 17-year-old sumo trainee died after a serious bullying incident involving his stablemaster Jun&#x27;ichi Yamamoto hitting him on the head with a large beer bottle and fellow being subsequently ordered to physically abuse him further. The stablemaster and three other wrestlers who were involved were arrested in February 2008, after which Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda demanded the JSA take steps to ensure such an incident never happens again. In May 2009, Yamamoto was sentenced to six years in jail. 

Violence affairs also came up to light in 2017, when Japanese newspaper &quot;Sports Nippon&quot; reported that Harumafuji had assaulted fellow Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa during a regional sumo tour in Tottori in late October. According to the report and other sources, Harumafuji was drinking with other sumo wrestlers (including Hakuhō, Kakuryū and Terunofuji) and was admonishing Takanoiwa over his behavior. Angered that Takanoiwa was looking at his cell phone at the time, Harumafuji struck him in the head with a beer bottle and punched him 20 to 30 times. Harumafuji was then questioned by the Sumo Association&#x27;s crisis management panel, where he admitted to assaulting Takanoiwa. 

On October 25, 2018, the association issued a statement introducing external experts involved in training, operation of procedures, and other measures to prevent the recurrence of violence. However, this did not stop the violence scandals, and, on December 26, 2022, Isegahama announced his resignation as director after a case of violence, where two junior wrestlers in his stable acted violently against younger wrestlers, with the victims beaten with wooden beams and burned with hot water poured on their backs. In May 2023, Michinoku stable&#x27;s senior wrestler, Kirinofuji, assaulted another young wrestler, Yasunishi, who had to take the matter to the press to trigger a response. Stablemaster Michinoku was accused of having covered these facts of violence by contributing directly to the fact that the aggressor can remain within the stable then letting him retire with dignity and without any charges brought against him. Hanakago, the director of the Compliance Department, is also criticized for having let the aggressor go unpunished, despite having been informed late and by the victim.

In March 2023 a former lower-ranked wrestler in Sadogatake stable, Daisuke Yanagihara, sued the Japan Sumo Association and his former stablemaster (ex-Kotonowaka) on allegations that he was forced to quit the sport. Yanagihara claimed that his human rights were violated and that, during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Sumo Association instituted health protocols, he was denied his request to sit out of the January 2021 tournament over fears of contracting the virus following cardiac surgery. In the lawsuit, Yanagihara also alleged mistreatment of lower-ranked wrestlers in his former stable, such as being served meals containing meat that was years beyond its expiration date. As of July 2023 the Sumo Association has not commented on the allegations.

==General communication==
===Logo===

The Japan Sumo Association, like most institutions, owns a . The design is based on cherry blossom, which is the national flower of Japan. Around the flower, two stylized characters for &#x27;big&#x27; or &#x27;great&#x27; (), extracted from the kanjis of professional sumo, called , can be seen. The logo was created in 1909 for the opening of the first Ryōgoku Kokugikan.

This symbol can be found in various places when the association holds celebration. It can be mainly seen on the &#x27;s (suspended roof above the dohyō) curtains, called . The wrestler who performs the (bow-twirling ceremony) also wears a decorated with this emblem.

===Sumo&#x27;s boost in popularity===
In the early 2020s, professional sumo experienced a popularity boost, launched, according to Nishiiwa (former Wakanosato), by Hakuhō&#x27;s period of dominance and the rise in visibility of foreign fans and , female fans commonly known as , displaying their passion for sumo and wrestlers on social networks. After the period of scandal, the association also set about restoring a positive public image by launching various measures. These included strengthening the JSA&#x27;s presence on social networks and developing merchandising. To develop the international market, the association also undertook to translate all its publications into English. Finally, the JSA created an official fan club in order to develop its fan base, offering them in return easier access to tournament tickets and inviting them to various festivals held at the Kokugikan.

===Ukiyo-e===
In 1985, the Japan Sumo Association created a partnership with artist in the hope of reviving old sumo works. He collaborated on the official . His portraits of wrestlers are sold at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan.

===Mascots===

In August 2009, the Japan Sumo Association unveiled a group of official mascots under the title . Designed to get more children interested in the sport, the characters are chickens (, which can be read as とり, in Japanese) as chicken are considered good luck in sumo. A chicken walks on two legs, not four; similarly, a sumo wrestler loses the match if he is knocked off his feet and touches the ground with his hands or any part of his body. The characters compete in sumo and are centered around main character , a pun on () meaning chick, and his rival . Mascot development included manga publishing and the installation of sticker dispensers at the Kokugikan. Plush toys were also created to popularize the mascots.

==Online presence==

===YouTube channels===
The Japan Sumo Association launched its first YouTube channel in November 2018, with content all in Japanese language. The channel offers light-hearted and humoristic videos, such as a golf competition between former Hakuhō, Kisenosato and Kakuryū or receipes with small skits featuring low-ranking wrestlers. It also provides more serious contents with insights on ceremonies held in the Kokugikan, such as the consecration of the before each tournaments or (hair cutting ceremony). Old tournaments are also regularly reruned on the channel.

In August 2022, the association launched an English-language YouTube channel called &quot;Sumo Prime Time&quot; in hopes of drawing a larger international audience to the sport. This new channel, presented by former NHK sumo sportscaster Hiroshi Morita, provides basic sumo explanations such as routine or training and kimarite moves. It also provides exclusive interviews of and , generally the winner of the previous tournament. The general tone of the channel is light-hearted.

In 2019, the association launched its official mobile app, named &quot;&quot;, in partnership with Dwango. The app broadcasts matches from the ranks with commentary from celebrities. Viewing changes depending on whether you&#x27;re a paying member (unlimited content) or accessing free content (limited to one match viewed per day).

<text>The 1986 Manitoba general election was held on March 18, 1986 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was won by the New Democratic Party, which took 30 seats out of 57. The Progressive Conservative Party won 26 seats and formed the official opposition. The Manitoba Liberal Party, which had not been represented in the previous legislature, won one seat.

==Opinion polls==

==Results==
1 &quot;Before&quot; refers to standings in the Legislature at dissolution, and not to the results of the previous election. These numbers therefore reflect changes in party standings as a result of by-elections and members crossing the floor.

==Riding results==

<text>Cytolysis, or osmotic lysis, occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to diffuse into the cell. Water can enter the cell by diffusion through the cell membrane or through selective membrane channels called aquaporins, which greatly facilitate the flow of water. It occurs in a hypotonic environment, where water moves into the cell by osmosis and causes its volume to increase to the point where the volume exceeds the membrane&#x27;s capacity and the cell bursts. The presence of a cell wall prevents the membrane from bursting, so cytolysis only occurs in animal and protozoa cells which do not have cell walls. The reverse process is plasmolysis.

==In bacteria==
Osmotic lysis would be expected to occur when bacterial cells are treated with a hypotonic solution with added lysozyme, which destroys the bacteria&#x27;s cell walls.

==Prevention==
Different cells and organisms have adapted different ways of preventing cytolysis from occurring. For example, the paramecium uses a contractile vacuole, which rapidly pumps out excessive water to prevent the build-up of water and the otherwise subsequent lysis.

<doc id="986022" wikidata="Q170507" url="?curid=986022" title="Nanterre">
<text>Nanterre (; ) is the prefecture of the Hauts-de-Seine department in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It is located some northwest of the centre of Paris. In 2018, the commune had a population of 96,807.

The eastern part of Nanterre, bordering the communes of Courbevoie and Puteaux, contains a small part of the La Défense business district of Paris and some of the tallest buildings in the Paris region. Because the headquarters of many major corporations are located in La Défense, the court of Nanterre is well known in the media for the number of high-profile lawsuits and trials that take place in it. The city of Nanterre also includes the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense, one of the largest universities in the Paris region.

==Name==

The name of Nanterre originated before the Roman conquest of Gaul. The Romans recorded the name as &quot;Nemetodorum&quot;. It is composed of the Celtic word &quot;nemeto&quot; meaning &quot;shrine&quot; or &quot;sacred place&quot; and the Celtic word &quot;duron&quot; (neuter) &quot;hard, tough, enduring&quot;. The sacred place referred to is believed to have been a famous shrine that existed in ancient times.

Inhabitants of Nanterre are called &quot;Nanterrien(ne)s&quot; or &quot;Nanterrois(es)&quot;.

==History==
The sacred shrine of antiquity that is referred to etymologically had been placed by tradition in Mont-Valérien. However, archeological discoveries made between 1994 and 2005 found a Gallic necropolis which has been dated to the third century BC, and also call into debate both the exact location of the pre-Roman capital of the Parisii and the initial site of Lutetia, the Roman era Paris. The large necropolis, as well as working people&#x27;s homes from some time later in the ancient era, is near the bank of the Seine, in the northwest of Nanterre, and might be the sacred place that is being referred to etymologically. Lutetia is mentioned by Julius Caesar in 50 BCE, reporting an assembly in Lutetia in 53 BC between himself, commander of the Roman Legions, and local Gallic leaders. Although this had been thought to possibly be Île de la Cité, largely since Caesar mentions an island, the river at Nanterre follows two channels around an island. In 52 BC, the Parisii took up arms with the Gallic war leader Vercingetorix, and were defeated by Titus Labienus, one of Caesar&#x27;s legates. Caesar mentions in his &quot;Commentarii&quot; that the Parisii destroyed the bridges and set fire to Lutetia before the arrival of the Roman forces. The archeological work in Nanterre has suggested over of pre-Roman or Roman-era construction. These archeological findings may be an indication that Nanterre was the closest pre-Roman settlement to the city&#x27;s modern centre.

Sainte Genevieve, patron saint of Paris, was born in Nanterre .

The Hôtel de Ville (town hall), designed in the shape of a pyramid, was completed in 1973.

On 27 March 2002, Richard Durn, a disgruntled local activist, shot and killed eight town councilors and 19 others were wounded at the town hall in what the French press dubbed the Nanterre massacre. On 28 March, the murderer killed himself by jumping from the 4th floor of 36 Quai des Orfèvres, in Paris, while he was questioned by two policemen about the reason for his killings.

In June 2023, seventeen year old Nahel Merzouk was killed by a police officer following a traffic stop. His death sparked violent unrest around France.

==Administration==
Nanterre is divided into two cantons:
* Canton of Nanterre-1
* Canton of Nanterre-2

==Transport==
Nanterre is served by three stations on RER A: , , and .

Nanterre-Université station is also an interchange station on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line.

==Economy==
Société Générale has its headquarters in the Tours Société Générale in La Défense and Nanterre. The company moved into the building in 1995.

Faurecia, the sixth-largest automotive parts supplier, has its headquarters in Nanterre.

Groupe du Louvre and subsidiary Louvre Hôtels have their head office in Village 5 in La Défense and Nanterre.

==Education==
Senior high schools include:
* Lycée Joliot-Curie de Nanterre
* Lycée professionnel Louise-Michel
* Lycée professionnel Paul-Langevin
* Lycée professionnel Claude-Chappe

==Sports==
The basketball club Nanterre 92 plays at Palais des Sports Maurice Thorez.

The rugby union club Racing 92 opened the new Paris La Défense Arena in October 2017 and played their first game in the new facility in December 2017. It has a capacity of 32,000 for rugby and 40,000 for concerts. The venue opened as U Arena, but received its current name in June 2018 through a sponsorship deal with Paris La Défense, the company that manages the La Défense business district.

<doc id="986029" wikidata="Q7624462" url="?curid=986029" title="Strong CP problem">
<text>The strong CP problem is a question in particle physics, which brings up the following quandary: why does quantum chromodynamics (QCD) seem to preserve CP-symmetry?

In particle physics, CP stands for the combination of C-symmetry (charge conjugation symmetry) and P-symmetry (parity symmetry). According to the current mathematical formulation of quantum chromodynamics, a violation of CP-symmetry in strong interactions could occur. However, no violation of the CP-symmetry has ever been seen in any experiment involving only the strong interaction. As there is no known reason in QCD for it to necessarily be conserved, this is a &quot;fine tuning&quot; problem known as the strong CP problem.

The strong CP problem is sometimes regarded as an unsolved problem in physics, and has been referred to as &quot;the most underrated puzzle in all of physics.&quot; There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem. The most well-known is Peccei–Quinn theory, involving new pseudoscalar particles called axions.

==Theory==

CP-symmetry states that physics should be unchanged if particles were swapped with their antiparticles and then left-handed and right-handed particles were also interchanged. This corresponds to performing a charge conjugation transformation and then a parity transformation. The symmetry is known to be broken in the Standard Model through weak interactions, but it is also expected to be broken through strong interactions which govern quantum chromodynamics (QCD), something that has not yet been observed. 

To illustrate how the CP violation can come about in QCD, consider a Yang–Mills theory with a single massive quark. The most general mass term possible for the quark is a complex mass written as formula_1 for some arbitrary phase formula_2. In that case the Lagrangian describing the theory consists of four terms:

:formula_3

The first and third terms are the CP-symmetric kinetic terms of the gauge and quark fields. The fourth term is the quark mass term which is CP violating for non-zero phases formula_4 while the second term is the so-called θ-term or “vacuum angle”, which also violates CP-symmetry. 

Quark fields can always be redefined by performing a chiral transformation by some angle formula_5 as

:formula_6

which changes the complex mass phase by formula_7 while leaving the kinetic terms unchanged. The transformation also changes the θ-term as formula_8 due to a change in the path integral measure, an effect closely connected to the chiral anomaly.

The theory would be CP invariant if one could eliminate both sources of CP violation through such a field redefinition. But this cannot be done unless formula_9. This is because even under such field redefinitions, the combination formula_10 remains unchanged. For example, the CP violation due to the mass term can be eliminated by picking formula_11, but then all the CP violation goes to the θ-term which is now proportional to formula_12. If instead the θ-term is eliminated through a chiral transformation, then there will be a CP violating complex mass with a phase formula_12. Practically, it is usually useful to put all the CP violation into the θ-term and thus only deal with real masses.

In the Standard Model where one deals with six quarks whose masses are described by the Yukawa matrices formula_14 and formula_15, the physical CP violating angle is formula_16. Since the θ-term has no contributions to perturbation theory, all effects from strong CP violation is entirely non-perturbative. Notably, it gives rise to a neutron electric dipole moment

:formula_17

Current experimental upper bounds on the dipole moment give an upper bound of formula_18cm, which requires formula_19. The angle formula_12 can take any value between zero and formula_21, so it taking on such a particularly small value is a fine-tuning problem called the strong CP problem.

==Proposed solutions==

The strong CP problem is solved automatically if one of the quarks is massless. In that case one can perform a set of chiral transformations on all the massive quark fields to get rid of their complex mass phases and then perform another chiral transformation on the massless quark field to eliminate the residual θ-term without also introducing a complex mass term for that field. This then gets rid of all CP violating terms in the theory. The problem with this solution is that all quarks are known to be massive from experimental matching with lattice calculations. Even if one of the quarks was essentially massless to solve the problem, this would in itself just be another fine-tuning problem since there is nothing requiring a quark mass to take on such a small value.

The most popular solution to the problem is through the Peccei–Quinn mechanism. This introduces a new global anomalous symmetry which is then spontaneously broken at low energies, giving rise to a pseudo-Goldstone boson called an axion. The axion ground state dynamically forces the theory to be CP-symmetric by setting formula_22. Axions are also considered viable candidates for dark matter and axion-like particles are also predicted by string theory.

Other less popular proposed solutions exist such as Nelson–Barr models. These set formula_22 at some high energy scale where CP-symmetry is exact but the symmetry is then spontaneously broken. The Nelson–Barr mechanism is a way of explaining why formula_12 remains small at low energies while the CP breaking phase in the CKM matrix is large.

<doc id="986033" wikidata="Q3060250" url="?curid=986033" title="Zinc oxide eugenol">
<text>Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) is a material created by the combination of zinc oxide and eugenol contained in clove oil. An acid–base reaction takes place with the formation of zinc eugenolate chelate. The reaction is catalysed by water and is accelerated by the presence of metal salts. ZOE can be used as a dental filling material or dental cement in dentistry. It is often used in dentistry when the decay is very deep or very close to the nerve or pulp chamber. Because the tissue inside the tooth, i.e. the pulp, reacts badly to the drilling stimulus (heat and vibration), it frequently becomes severely inflamed and precipitates a condition called acute or chronic pulpitis. This condition usually leads to severe chronic tooth sensitivity or actual toothache and can then only be treated with the removal of the nerve (pulp) called root canal therapy. For persons with a dry socket as a complication of tooth extraction, packing the dry socket with a eugenol-zinc oxide paste on iodoform gauze is effective for reducing acute pain. The placement of a ZOE &quot;temporary&quot; for a few to several days prior to the placement of the final filling can help to sedate the pulp. But, ZOE had in vitro cytotoxicity majorly due to release of Zn ions, not eugenol. In spite of severe in vitro cytotoxicity, ZOE showed relatively good biocompatibility in animal study when ZOE was applied on dentin. When ZOE was used as dentin-protective based materials, use of dental composite resin on ZOE was strongly prevented due to its inhibition of resin polymerization through radical scavenging effect. It is classified as an intermediate restorative material and has anaesthetic and antibacterial properties. The exact mechanism of anesthetic effect from ZOE was not revealed perfectly, but possibly through anti-inflammatory effect, modulating immune cells to less inflamed status.

It is sometimes used in the management of dental caries as a &quot;temporary filling&quot;. ZOE cements were introduced in the 1890s.

Zinc oxide eugenol is also used as an impression material during construction of complete dentures and is used in the mucostatic technique of taking impressions, usually in a special tray, (acrylic) produced after primary alginate impressions. However, ZOE is not usually used if the patient has large undercuts or tuberosities, whereby silicone impression materials would be better suited.

Zinc oxide eugenol is also used as an antimicrobial additive in paint.

==Types==
According to ANSI/ADA Specification no:30 (ISO 3107) and
depending on intended use and individual formulation designed for each specific purpose.
==Composition==
The chemical composition of ZOE is typically:
* Zinc oxide, ~69.0%
* White (bleached) rosin, ~29.3%
* Zinc acetate, ~1.0% (improves strength)
* Zinc stearate, ~0.7% (acts as accelerator)
* Liquid (eugenol, ~85%, olive oil ~15%)

ZOE impression pastes are sold in two separate tubes. The first tube contains zinc oxide and vegetable or mineral oil, while the second tube contains eugenol and rosin. The vegetable or mineral oil acts as a plasticizer and helps to counteract the irritant action of eugenol.

Clove oil, which contains 70% to 85% eugenol, is sometimes used instead of eugenol because it causes less burning sensation in patients when it comes into contact with soft tissues. Rosin added to the paste in the second tube speeds up the reaction and produces a smoother, more homogeneous product.

Canada balsam and Balsam of Peru are often used to increase flow and improve mixing properties. If the mixed paste is too thin or lacks body before it sets, a filler (such as a wax) or an inert powder (such as kaolin, talc, or diatomaceous earth) may be added to one or both of the original pastes.

<doc id="986040" wikidata="Q5312122" url="?curid=986040" title="Due-on-sale clause">
<text>A due-on-sale clause is a clause in a loan or promissory note that stipulates that the full balance of the loan may be called due (repaid in full) upon sale or transfer of ownership of the property used to secure the note. The lender has the right, but not the obligation, to call the note due in such a circumstance.

In real estate investing, the due-on-sale clause can be an impediment for a property owner who wishes to sell the property and have the buyer take over an existing loan rather than paying the loan off as part of the sale. Likewise, a due-on-sale clause would interfere with a seller&#x27;s extension of financing to a buyer by using a wraparound mortgage, also called an &quot;all-inclusive mortgage&quot;, &quot;all-inclusive deed of trust&quot;, &quot;all-inclusive trust deed&quot;, or &quot;AITD.&quot; Any of these arrangements triggers the due-on-sale clause in the seller&#x27;s existing mortgage and thus the lender may call the loan due. If a property with a due-on-sale clause in the mortgage loan is transferred and the loan is not paid off, the bank could call the loan and then foreclose on the property if the buyer is unable to immediately tender the entire remaining balance on the loan. How likely this is depends on how the real estate economy is doing. If the buyer continues to pay the loan payments when due, it is less likely that the bank would actually call the loan due but it is still the bank&#x27;s choice. 

In the early 1980s, with interest rates on new loans at 18%, banks frequently attempted to enforce due-on-sale clauses with respect to older loans that had been made at lower interest rates (especially those made prior to the 1973–75 recession and the ensuing stagflation), so they could retire those loans from their books, force buyers to obtain new loans to fund their transactions, and lend funds to them at higher interest rates. In the lending market of the 2010s, many observers believe that banks are not likely to enforce due-on-sale provisions unless they have another reason to call the loan due.

== United States law ==

Virtually all mortgage loans made in the United States by institutional lenders in recent years contain a due-on-sale clause. These clauses are meant to require the loan to be paid in full in the case of a sale or conveyance of interest in the subject property. This is in contrast to the wide availability of assumable mortgages in the past. Assumable mortgages would allow a second party to assume the position of borrower and essentially adopt the agreement that is already in place between the buyer and the financial institution. Until 1982, the enforceability of due-on-sale provisions was basically a matter of state, not federal, law. Many states had adopted laws that permitted existing loans to be assumed by buyers whether or not the lender was willing to agree. The logic behind these laws was generally that a lender should be permitted to call a loan due when the property securing the loan is sold only if the lender could demonstrate that the sale and transfer of the property reduced the lender&#x27;s security or increased the risk that the loan would go into default.

However, in 1982 Congress passed the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act. Section 341a of the Act (codified in Title 12, U.S. Code, Section 1701j-3) makes the enforceability of due-on-sale provisions a federal issue and provides that if real estate loan documents contain a due-on-sale provision, that provision is enforceable if the property securing the loan is transferred without the lender&#x27;s consent. Institutional lenders successfully lobbied Congress heavily to add Section 341a of the Act to federal law.

Lenders are generally not required to include due-on-sale provisions in loans, but it is nearly universal practice for institutional lenders to include them. For loans by private lenders, such as financing extended to buyers by sellers, due-on-sale provisions are not always included. Also, a buyer and seller could negotiate to include due-on-sale clause that allows a one-time loan assumption.

There are certain exceptions to enforceability of due-on-sale clauses. These are generally contained in Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, part 191. For example, borrowers may place their homes in their own trust without triggering the due-on-sale clause. &quot;A lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains &quot;a&quot; beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.&quot; (12 U.S.C. 1701j-3(d)(8)..[5].) Note that &quot;a&quot; beneficiary means possibly among multiple beneficiaries. Similarly, transfer of the borrower&#x27;s home to a spouse as part of a divorce or dissolution of marriage generally does not trigger a due-on-sale clause. There are other exemptions in the law as well. Use trusts also facilitates transfers of property to heirs and minors. It may also protect the property of wealthy or risky owners against the possibility of future lawsuits or creditors because the trust, not the individuals at risk, owns the property.

<doc id="986041" wikidata="Q5288143" url="?curid=986041" title="Dog-leg gearbox">
<text>A dog-leg gearbox or dogleg gearbox is a manual transmission shift pattern distinguished by an up-over-up shift between first and second gear. The layout derives its name from a dog&#x27;s hind leg, with its sharp angles. Dog leg gearboxes were replaced in most mass production vehicles by transmissions with a standard gear layout. Most modern manual performance cars have six-speed gearboxes, which are unsuited to the dog-leg layout.

==Automobiles==
Dog-leg layout gearboxes were a reinterpretation of the classic 5-speed gate pattern: as in road racing more frequent shifting occurs from second to third than from first to second gear, the dog-leg gearbox puts 2nd and 3rd gear opposed one to the other, for a very quick up-shifting or down-shifting. This could bring the driver a great speed range with only one shift, which was particularly suitable for hillclimbing. They were transferred to sports cars in the 60s as a desirable feature. With the introduction of 6-speed manual gearboxes in the mid-90s and automated manual transmissions a few years later, dog leg gearboxes started to fall out of use.

Examples of cars that have used this pattern for performance reasons include Alfa Romeo Montreal and Alfa 6 (all models 1979/1987), BMW M535, early 635CSi (non-US) and (non-US) M3 E30, BMW 2002 Tii and Turbo, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 and 2.5-16, Mercedes-Benz 300 CE-24, Mercedes-Benz CW311, most Ferraris from 60s to mid 90s (last ones being Ferrari 348 and Ferrari F512M), Dino 206/246 GT and cars featuring its engine and ZF transmission combo (Lancia Stratos and Fiat Dino -only 2.4 version-), the 60s Ford GT40 with a ZF transaxle, early Porsche 911 and 5-speed 912, Porsche 914 and 914/6, Porsche 924 (optional in 1978 and 79, standard in 1979 and 1980 Turbo variant), 928 and 959 (all featuring Getrag gearboxes), Cosworth Vega, Talbot Sunbeam Lotus, later model Jensen-Healey, Vauxhall Firenza HPF, Vauxhall Chevette HS and HSR, Lancia Fulvia, many classic Lamborghinis (including Countach, Urraco/Silhouette/Jalpa and Diablo), Maserati Biturbo, De Tomaso Pantera, and Aston Martin V12 Vantage.

Despite the performance benefits, non-performance-oriented cars available with the dog-leg shift pattern were produced. Examples include the Ford Model A, Subaru 360, Datsun 140Y (Datsun Sunny B310 Coupe), Datsun 160J Hardtop SSS, 74–77 Datsun 610 SSS, 78–80 Datsun 200sx, 1980 Datsun 210 Wagon (built during the 210/310 crossover), 78–80 Datsun 510, Citroën 2CV, Mercedes 190, Mercedes-Benz 200D, Mercedes-Benz 300CE, Mercedes-Benz 320CE, Mercedes-Benz E320 sedan -94, Mercedes-Benz 300SL (R129), and the 1976–77 Oldsmobile Cutlass or Pontiac LeMans with the 260 V8, the 76–77 Chevrolet Vega or Pontiac Astre, 76–79 Chevrolet Monza or Buick Skyhawk or Oldsmobile Starfire, BMW E21, the 77–79 Pontiac Sunbird and TATA Sierra in India. The early model Renault 4 had a distinctive &#x27;umbrella handle&#x27; dog-leg shift, which proved ideal for urban driving, though the shift was later changed to the &#x27;conventional&#x27; pattern.

==Trucks==
Many light trucks (e.g. Iveco Turbo Daily) have dog-leg five- or six-speed transmissions, because second gear is fine for normal starting; first is considered a &quot;crawler&quot; or &quot;granny&quot; gear in these trucks and is only used for starting with heavy loads and/or a trailer, or descending steep grades. In many older trucks, the shifter is marked with &quot;Low&quot; instead of &quot;1&quot;, and 2nd gear is marked as 1st instead. A 4-speed truck gearshift might read &quot;R, Low, 1, 2, 3&quot;, rather than &quot;R, 1, 2, 3, 4&quot;, since the transmission is considered a 3-speed with an auxiliary low gear rather than a normal 4 speed.

The dog leg gearbox is typical of nine- and ten-speed heavy-truck transmissions. In the case of a ten-speed transmission, the gears are 1–5 in the low range and 6–10 in the high range (the 1 position is not used in the high range of a nine-speed transmission).

== Infrastructure ==

Noida ranks one of the cleanest medium population cities when it comes to cleanliness among cities in India. The creation of associated physical infrastructure is higher in Noida and Greater Noida. Most of the land in Noida is not very fertile and the agricultural output is low. It is in the flood plains of the Yamuna River on one side and the Hindon River on the other. Many villages are visible from the Noida Expressway, beginning from the Mahamaya flyover to Greater Noida on both sides. One end of the Taj expressway terminates on Noida Expressway near the Hindon River and the other at Agra. Up until the 1980s, these villages were flooded every two–three years, resulting in people temporarily moving to other places in Noida, and even as far as Mehrauli in South Delhi. Noida is also famous for its tall buildings and comes 2nd in India after Mumbai in this parameter.

The new Parthala Flyover in Noida, which is often compared to the iconic Signature Bridge, is a major infrastructure improvement for the region. The flyover spans across the busy Parthala Chowk intersection, providing a faster and more efficient route for commuters. With its sleek and modern design, the Parthala Flyover has quickly become a landmark in the area and has drawn comparisons to the Signature Bridge in Delhi. While it may not have the same scale or grandeur as the Signature Bridge, the Parthala Flyover is a significant development that has greatly improved the flow of traffic in Noida and reduced travel time for commuters.
There is always a huge amount of revenue surplus each year as they are unable to spend the entire amount on development or on maintaining civic amenities. Lease rent and interest from builders are the biggest contributors to Noida&#x27;s revenue. Besides, the authority gets huge revenues out of water and property transfer charges. &quot;The Noida authority had deposited 3,500 crore as fixed deposits in various banks because of surplus funds. Noida has so much surplus funds with it that it can run the city even if it does not take any taxes from its allottees for 5 years in a row.&quot;

A tall skyscraper named &quot;Supernova Spira&quot; stands on the Noida side of Delhi Noida Border. It will be the tallest residential tower in northern India after its completion in 2021. The Noida Authority&#x27;s plans to establish &#x27;New Noida&#x27; have opened new opportunities in the Dadri-Noida-Ghaziabad Investment Region (DNGIR). The region will be settled in four phases, according to the Master Plan 2041 submitted recently to the Authority. New Noida will include a land bank consisting of 87 villages of Bulandshahr and Dadri.

In 2014, Allahabad High Court orders demolition of twin towers, pulls up Noida Authority for collusion with developer. Construction work stopped at the site in 2014 but the twin towers in Noida, built illegally by realty firm Supertech Ltd., were brought down within 12 seconds around 2.30 p.m. on 28 August 2022 with more than 3,700 kg of explosives.

== Economy ==

In the last few years, Noida has also become a hub for software and mobile app development companies like Microsoft, Arm Holdings, HCL, Samsung and Barclays. These companies are contributing to the city&#x27;s economy with their software product development and service export in foreign currencies. Samsung recently invested in Noida, under the Make in India initiative.

Paytm, India&#x27;s largest unicorn fintech company is also headquartered in Noida.

Considered a &quot;primitive&quot; plant – a descendant of possibly the first group of vascular plants from 400 million years ago – that was widespread during the Devonian and Silurian periods – its name means &quot;bare naked&quot; in Latin as it lacks most of the organs found in plants species that evolved later.

Noida&#x27;s botanical garden is divided into 10 sections. The &quot;medicinal plants&quot; section has an astounding variety of 96 plants and is further divided into eight sections named after the parts of the human body they benefit.

== Villages in Noida City ==
Noida originally consisted of around 81 villages, but now comes under the Gautam Buddh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh.

Still, Noida villages lack permanent postal and individual address but according to officials, the homes in villages will be soon mapped using aerial imagery captured by drones designed by North East Centre For Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR), an autonomous society set up under the Union government&#x27;s department of science and technology. These maps will also provide crucial information about rural areas in an emergency. Officials said it will take almost a year to complete mapping and allotting addresses to all 81 villages.

With houses getting mapped and being allotted a formal address in Noida villages, procuring information on land rights, development plans, etc. will become easier. &quot;Easily available maps will also be helpful in advancing development plans and settling disputes over bordering parcels of land. Mapping will also ease land transfers, by creating reliable maps and title documents.&quot;

<doc id="986051" wikidata="Q2828883" url="?curid=986051" title="Fine-tuning (physics)">
<text>In theoretical physics, fine-tuning is the process in which parameters of a model must be adjusted very precisely in order to fit with certain observations.

Theories requiring fine-tuning are regarded as problematic in the absence of a known mechanism to explain why the parameters happen to have precisely the observed values that they return. The heuristic rule that parameters in a fundamental physical theory should not be too fine-tuned is called naturalness.

== Background == 

The idea that naturalness will explain fine tuning was brought into question by Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist, in his talk &quot;Why is there a Macroscopic Universe?&quot;, a lecture from the mini-series &quot;Multiverse &amp; Fine Tuning&quot; from the &quot;Philosophy of Cosmology&quot; project, a University of Oxford and Cambridge Collaboration 2013. In it he describes how naturalness has usually provided a solution to problems in physics; and that it had usually done so earlier than expected. However, in addressing the problem of the cosmological constant, naturalness has failed to provide an explanation though it would have been expected to have done so a long time ago.

The necessity of fine-tuning leads to various problems that do not show that the theories are incorrect, in the sense of falsifying observations, but nevertheless suggest that a piece of the story is missing. For example, the cosmological constant problem (why is the cosmological constant so small?); the hierarchy problem; and the strong CP problem, among others.

== Example ==
An example of a fine-tuning problem considered by the scientific community to have a plausible &quot;natural&quot; solution is the cosmological flatness problem, which is solved if inflationary theory is correct: inflation forces the universe to become very flat, answering the question of why the universe is today observed to be flat to such a high degree.

== Measurement ==
Although fine-tuning was traditionally measured by ad hoc fine-tuning measures, such as the Barbieri-Giudice-Ellis measure, over the past decade many scientists recognized that fine-tuning arguments were a specific application of Bayesian statistics.

<doc id="986055" wikidata="Q319055" url="?curid=986055" title="Taihō Kōki">
<text>was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler. He became the 48th &quot;yokozuna&quot; in 1961 at the age of 21, the youngest ever at the time.

Kōki won 32 tournament championships between 1960 and 1971, a record that was unequalled until 2014. His dominance was such that he won six tournaments in a row on two occasions, and he won 45 consecutive matches between 1968 and 1969, which at the time was the best winning streak since Futabayama in the 1930s. He is the only wrestler to win at least one championship every year of his top division career.

He was a popular grand champion, especially amongst women and children. After retiring from active competition, he became a sumo coach, although health problems meant he had limited success.

When Kōki died in January 2013, he was widely cited as the greatest sumo wrestler of the post-war period.

==Early career==

Kōki&#x27;s birth name was Ivan Boryshko. He was born on the island of Sakhalin (Karafuto Prefecture) to a Japanese mother Kiyo Naya and an ethnic Ukrainian father Markiyan Boryshko who was born in Runivshchyna in present-day Krasnohrad Raion, Kharkiv Oblast and had fled the Bolshevik Revolution. However, he is regarded as having come from Teshikaga, Hokkaidō, where he moved to as a child after the Soviet Union took control of Sakhalin in 1945. While on a sumo tour to the Soviet Union in 1965 he tried to locate his father, but without success. Taihō was the first of three great &quot;yokozuna&quot; who all hailed from Hokkaidō, the most northerly of the main islands of Japan and who among them dominated sumo during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The others were Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji.

He entered sumo in September 1956, joining Nishonoseki stable. He initially fought under his real name of Naya Kōki. Upon promotion to the second &quot;jūryō&quot; division in May 1959 he was given the &quot;shikona&quot; (ring name) of &quot;Taihō&quot;, meaning &quot;Great peng&quot; (&quot;peng&quot; is often translated to &quot;phoenix&quot;). Taihō rapidly rose through the ranks after his debut in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division in January 1960. In his first tournament in the top division, he recorded eleven consecutive wins from day one, a record that took 64 years to be equalled by Takerufuji. Because he scored twelve victories in total, he was a runner-up in his first top division tournament and was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. At &quot;sekiwake&quot; rank in November 1960 he won the first of his former record 32 tournament championships and earned promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;. Following two consecutive tournament victories (his second and third) he became a &quot;yokozuna&quot; in September 1961, less than two years after his top division debut. Because the island of Sakhalin is/was claimed as a Japanese territory, Taihō is not considered the first non-Japanese &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

==&quot;Yokozuna&quot;==
At the time of his promotion, Taihō was the youngest wrestler ever to have achieved sumo&#x27;s highest rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot; aged 21 years and three months, a record subsequently surpassed by Kitanoumi who was one month younger. In a fashion which is considered to be exceptional for a newly promoted &quot;yokozuna&quot; he also managed to win his first tournament subsequent to his promotion. He was promoted simultaneously with Kashiwado, and their rivalry created what became known as the &quot;Hakuhō&quot; era. Although Kashiwado was to win only five tournament championships, Taihō was to remark, &quot;There was Taihō because there was Kashiwado. There was Kashiwado because there was Taihō.&quot; Outside of competition they had a genuine friendship, which continued until Kashiwado&#x27;s death in 1996.

Taihō outperformed Kashiwado very quickly, and during his tenure in sumo&#x27;s highest rank he was dominant, especially in the early part of his career. Until 2005—when the 68th &quot;yokozuna&quot; Asashōryū bettered his record—he was the only post-war &quot;yokozuna&quot; to have achieved six tournament victories consecutively, a feat he managed on two separate occasions. Eight of Taihō&#x27;s championships were achieved with a perfect record of 15 wins and no losses (&quot;zenshō-yūshō&quot;), a record that stood until 2013 when it was broken by Hakuhō. He came back from withdrawing from or missing five straight tournaments to win the championship in September 1968 with a 14–1 record and embarked on a 45 bout winning streak. It was broken in March 1969 only after an incorrect decision by the judges, which caused such a furor that video replays were introduced after the incident.

His final championship came in January 1971 after a playoff with Tamanoumi, maintaining his record of winning at least one championship every year of his top division career. He had a good score of 12–3 in the following tournament; however, he announced his retirement five days into the May 1971 tournament after losing to the promising young wrestler Takanohana for the second time. He had been a &quot;yokozuna&quot; for nearly ten years. His career win ratio was in excess of 80%, which is also a post-war record. He became the first former &quot;rikishi&quot; to be offered (and accept) membership of the Japan Sumo Association without having to purchase a share (&quot;ichidai toshiyori&quot;), in recognition of his great achievements.

==After retirement==
Taihō branched off from his old &quot;heya&quot; and opened Taihō stable in December 1971. In February 1977, at the age of 36, he suffered a stroke, and his subsequent health problems may have played a part in him being passed over for the chairmanship of the Sumo Association. He had extensive rehabilitation sessions to get the left side of his body moving again. In general he did not manage to replicate his own wrestling success as a trainer, but he did produce Ōzutsu, a &quot;sekiwake&quot; who fought in 78 consecutive top division tournaments from 1979 to 1992. He had his &quot;kanreki dohyō-iri&quot; ceremony to mark his 60th birthday in 2000, although his restricted mobility meant he could not perform it in full. In fact, suffering from a stroke at the age of 36, he was originally scheduled not to perform the ceremony at all, but only to pose for a commemorative photo with his &quot;tsuna&quot; tied behind him. However, he was able to complete his Unryū ring-entering style by tightly pinching the skin of his stomach with the fingers of his left hand so that his left arm, which was not free to move, would not slump down. In May 2002 Taihō recruited the Russian wrestler Rohō. He handed over control of his stable to his son-in-law, ex-&quot;sekiwake&quot; Takatōriki, in February 2003.

Taihō reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in May 2005 and became the curator of the Sumo Museum at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan. He still maintained close contact with his old stable, inviting &quot;yokozuna&quot; Hakuhō to train there in May 2008.

Taihō was awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon by the Japanese government in 2004. In November 2009, he was one of 15 people to receive the Person of Cultural Merit award from the Japanese government, becoming the first sumo wrestler to be so honoured.

After suffering a stroke at 36 in 1977, Taihō used a wheelchair in the last stage of his life. He died of heart failure in a Tokyo hospital on January 19, 2013, at the age of 72. His death was announced by the Japan Sumo Association. In its obituary, &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot; named him &quot;the strongest yokozuna in history.&quot; In February 2013, he posthumously became the second sumo wrestler to be commended with the People&#x27;s Honour Award, with Yoshihide Suga calling him a &quot;national hero.&quot; After winning the March 2013 championship, Hakuhō urged the crowd to get to their feet and honour Taihō&#x27;s memory with a moment of silence. He said that Taihō gave him regular advice, and told him that records are meant to be broken. Hakuhō would indeed surpass Taihō&#x27;s all-time championship record by winning his 33rd &quot;yushō&quot; in January 2015, two years after Taihō&#x27;s death.

==Fighting style==
Taihō was noted for his skill and power when he grabbed his opponents&#x27; &quot;mawashi&quot; or belt– techniques known as &quot;yotsu-sumo&quot;. His preferred grip was &quot;hidari-yotsu&quot;, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning move was &quot;yori-kiri&quot;, a straightforward force out, which accounted for about 30 percent of his wins. His most frequently used throws were &quot;sukuinage&quot; (the beltless scoop throw) and &quot;uwatenage&quot; (the overarm throw).

He was particularly diligent about training, and was known to invite every new member of the top division to train with him.

==Family==
He married in 1966 at the height of his fame (coincidentally, the final day of the May Tournament that year, which he won, was also his 26th birthday), to the daughter of a &quot;ryokan&quot; proprietor. Their lavish reception at the Imperial Hotel was attended by 1000 guests and over 200 reporters. He was the first to hold a press conference afterwards, now a common occurrence with sumo marriages.

Taihō&#x27;s youngest daughter married the former &quot;sekiwake&quot; Takatoriki, who took over the running of Taihō stable (renamed Ōtake stable) after Taihō&#x27;s retirement. When Ōtake was dismissed from sumo after a gambling scandal, he divorced Taihō&#x27;s daughter. Taihō&#x27;s grandson Konosuke Naya (born 2000) joined Ōtake stable as a professional sumo wrestler in January 2018, using Ōhō as his &quot;shikona&quot;. He was followed into sumo by his brothers Kosei in November 2019 and Takamori in March 2020. Taihō&#x27;s fourth and eldest grandson, Yukio Naya (born 1994), is a professional wrestler.

==Career record==

<doc id="986058" wikidata="Q36126" url="?curid=986058" title="Komi language">
<text>Komi (, ), also known as Zyran, Zyrian or Komi-Zyryan (), is the native language of the Komi (Zyrians). It is one of the Permian languages; the other regional variety is Komi-Permyak.

Komi is spoken in the Komi Republic and other parts of Russia such as Nenetsia and Yamalia. There were 285,000 speakers in 1994, which decreased to 160,000 in 2010.

It was formerly written in the Old Permic script created by Stephen of Perm for liturgical purposes in the 14th century, though very few texts exist in this script. The Cyrillic script was introduced by Russian missionaries in the 17th century, replacing it. A tradition of secular works of literature in the modern form of the language dates back to the 19th century.

==Dialects==
Komi has ten dialects: Syktyvkardin (Sysola), Lower Ežva (Vychegda), Central Ežva (Vychegda), Upper Ežva (Vychegda), Luz-let, Upper Sysola, Pećöra, Iźva, Vym, and Udora dialects. Syktyvkardin is spoken in the region of Syktyvkar and forms the model for the generic standard dialect of the language. Dialects are divided based primarily on their use of and :
* Older * remains unchanged in Upper Ežva and Pećöra dialects (also in most dialects of Komi-Permyak).
* In Central dialects, changed to syllable-finally; for instance, in literary Komi * → &quot;tongue&quot;.
* In Northern dialects, changes of continued with complete vocalization of syllable-final , resulting in long vowels.

The start of the change date to the 17th century. It is not seen in the oldest Komi texts from the 14th century, nor in loanwords from Komi to Khanty, dated to the 16th; though it fully occurred before Russian loanwords that entered the language in the 18th century as remains unchanged in these.

Some dialects are further distinguished based on the palatalized alveolars , which have unpacked in syllable-final position as clusters .

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
===Vowels===

There are no diphthongs, although vowel sequences can occur at morpheme boundaries.

The phoneme is phonetically , and is phonetically . There is noticeable positional allophony, depending on the surrounding consonants, however no allophone overlaps with another vowel phoneme.

== Writing system ==

The Old Permic script is the first writing system for Komi. It was invented in the 14th century by the missionary Stephen of Perm. The alphabet resembled medieval Greek and Cyrillic. The script was also known as Anbur (Komi: , Анбур), named for the first 2 letters of the script, &quot;&quot;an&quot; &amp; &quot;bur&quot;&quot; (𐍐 &amp; 𐍑, respectively). It is no longer in use today, though it has received Unicode Support as &quot;Old Permic&quot; in recent times. The script saw use in Komi-inhabited areas, primarily the Principality of Great Perm and parts of Bjarmaland.

In the 16th century, this alphabet was replaced by the Russian alphabet with certain modifications for affricates. In the 1920s, the language was written in the Molodtsov alphabet, which also derived from Cyrillic. In the 1930s, during the Latinisation in the Soviet Union, Komi was briefly written with a version of the Latin script. Since the 1940s it uses the Russian-based Cyrillic alphabet with the additional letters &quot;І, і&quot; and &quot;Ӧ, ӧ&quot;.
Letters particular to the Molodtsov alphabet include ԁ, ԃ, ԅ, ԇ, ԉ, ԋ, ԍ, ԏ, most of which represent palatalized consonants.

==Grammar==
Komi has 17 cases, with a rich inventory of locative cases. Like other Uralic languages, Komi has no gender. Verbs agree with subjects in person and number (sg/pl). Negation is expressed with an auxiliary verb, which is inflected for person, number and tense.

Komi is an agglutinative language and adheres to a subject–object–verb order. Most modern texts, however, possess a subject-verb-object word order, due to heavy Russian language influence and the resulting calques.

<text>John Gall (September 18, 1925 – December 15, 2014) was an American author, scholar, and pediatrician. Gall is known for his 1975 book &quot;General systemantics: an essay on how systems work, and especially how they fail...&quot;, a critique of systems theory. One of the statements from this book has become known as Gall&#x27;s law.

== Biography ==
Gall started his studies in St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland. He received further medical training at George Washington University Medical School in Washington, and Yale College. Eventually, in the early 1960s he took his pediatric training at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

In the 1960s Gall started as a practicing pediatrician in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and became part of the faculty of the University of Michigan. In 2001 he retired after more than 40 years of private practice. In the first decades of his practice he had also &quot;conducted weekly seminars in Parenting Strategies for parents, prospective parents, medical students, nursing students, and other health care practitioners.&quot; Until 2001 he held the position of clinical associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Beginning in 1958 he was a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

After he retired, Gall and his wife Carol A. Gall moved to Walker, Minnesota, where he continued writing and published seven more titles.
He died on December 15, 2014, from natural causes.

== Work ==
Gall&#x27;s main research interest was the behavioral and developmental problems of children, on which subject he published several scientific papers and books. As a sideline he conducted more general research on the question of what makes systems work and fail. He collected and analyzed all kinds of examples of systems-failures, and generalized problems and pitfalls into a series of &quot;Laws of Systems&quot;.

In 2002 Gall also published a historical novel on Hatshepsut, queen of ancient Egypt in the Eighteenth Dynasty. This interest arose from a trip he made to Egypt in 1969.

=== Systemantics ===

In 1975 he published his systems research under the title &quot;General systemantics&quot;, republished two years later as &quot;Systemantics: How Systems Work and Especially How They Fail&quot; by Quadrangle, The New York Times Book Company. This work has been translated into Spanish, German, Hebrew, and Japanese.

In 1986 the second edition was published with the title &quot;Systemantics: The Underground Text of Systems Lore.&quot;, which was almost twice the size of the first edition.

In 2002 he published a third edition under the title &quot;The Systems Bible&quot;. This work inspired many authors in the systems movement, such as scientists Mario Bunge (1979), Paul Watzlawick (1990) and Russell L. Ackoff (1999), and systems designers Ken Orr (1981) and Grady Booch (1991).

=== Gall&#x27;s law ===
Gall&#x27;s Law is a rule of thumb for systems design from Gall&#x27;s book &quot;Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail&quot;. It states:

This law is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification: it can be used to explain the success of systems like the World Wide Web and Blogosphere, which grew from simple to complex systems incrementally, and the failure of systems like CORBA, which began with complex specifications. Gall&#x27;s Law has strong affinities to the practice of agile software development.

Although dubbed &quot;Gall&#x27;s Law&quot; by some, the phrase is not labeled as such in the original work. The work cites Murphy&#x27;s Law and the Peter Principle, and includes similar sayings.

Although the quote may seem to validate the merits of simple systems, it is preceded by the qualifier, &quot;A simple system may or may not work.&quot; (p. 70). This philosophy can also be attributed to extreme programming, which encourages doing the simplest thing first and adding features later.

One of the first systems designers to quote Gall&#x27;s law was Ken Orr in 1981. Notable were the quotations of Gall&#x27;s Law by Grady Booch since 1991, which were mentioned in multiple sources.

<doc id="986068" wikidata="Q664604" url="?curid=986068" title="Kitanoumi Toshimitsu">
<text>, born , was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler. He was the dominant wrestler in the sport during the 1970s. Kitanoumi was promoted to &quot;yokozuna&quot; at the age of 21, becoming the youngest ever to achieve sumo&#x27;s top rank. He won 24 tournament championships during his career and was one of a series of truly great &quot;yokozuna&quot; who came from Hokkaido, the largest and northernmost prefecture of Japan. At the time of his death he still held the records for most tournaments at &quot;yokozuna&quot; (63) and most bouts won as a &quot;yokozuna&quot; (670), but they have since been surpassed. Following his retirement in 1985 he established the Kitanoumi stable. He was chairman of the Japan Sumo Association from 2002 until 2008, and again from 2012 until his death.

==Career==
Born in Sōbetsu, Hokkaido, Kitanoumi began his professional sumo career in January 1967 at the age of 13, whilst still in middle school. He joined Mihogaseki stable, and was promoted to sumo&#x27;s second highest &quot;jūryō&quot; division in May 1971 and the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division a year later. He won his first top division &quot;yūshō&quot; or tournament championship in January 1974 and was promoted to &quot;ōzeki&quot; immediately afterwards. He secured promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot; just three tournaments after that. At 21 years 2 months, he was the youngest ever &quot;yokozuna&quot;, beating the previous record held by Taihō by one month.

Kitanoumi was the most successful wrestler in sumo for the rest of the 1970s. His dominance, and perceived stern demeanor, meant that he was not that popular with the general public. When he was defeated by underdog Takanohana in a playoff for the championship in September 1975, the audience threw so many &quot;zabuton&quot;—or cushions—into the ring in delight, that Kitanoumi said he could &quot;hardly see the ceiling&quot;. He was known for not offering a defeated opponent a hand to get back to their feet, and was also notoriously monosyllabic when being interviewed by reporters. His best year was 1978, when he won five of the six tournaments and won 82 out of a possible 90 bouts, a record that stood until 2005. His chief rival during these years was Wajima, but Kitanoumi was much more consistent. He was heavy at 169 kg, was extremely strong and had excellent balance. He was also remarkably injury free and rarely missed a tournament. From July 1973 until September 1981 he chalked up 50 consecutive &quot;kachi-koshi&quot;, or tournament records of at least eight wins out of 15, which was a record for the top division until 2015, when Hakuhō reached 51 consecutive &quot;kachi-koshi&quot;.

By the beginning of the 1980s he had a new rival, Chiyonofuji, who earned promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot; and then &quot;yokozuna&quot; by defeating him in decisive matches in January and July 1981. In November 1981 Kitanoumi withdrew from a tournament for the first time. After that his record was patchy, with many absences. His 24th and final title came in May 1984, with a perfect 15–0 record. This was seen by many as a fitting end to a great career and he wanted to retire after that tournament, but was persuaded by the Sumo Association to carry on until the opening of the new Ryōgoku Kokugikan stadium in January 1985. Three days into the tournament, without winning a match, he announced his retirement. He had been ranked as a &quot;yokozuna&quot; on the &quot;banzuke&quot; in 63 tournaments, which remained the most in history until Hakuhō surpassed it in May 2018. During his career he had won 951 matches, the most in history at the time (he was overtaken by Ōshio in 1987). Of those victories, 804 came in the top division (a record broken by Chiyonofuji in 1991), and 670 of those came at the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank.
==After retirement==

Kitanoumi was honored for his great achievements by being offered membership of the Japan Sumo Association without having to purchase a share (&quot;ichidai toshiyori&quot;). He was the second &quot;rikishi&quot; after Taihō to be given this honor. As a result, he was able to keep his sumo name after retirement. He opened up his own training stable, Kitanoumi stable, taking several wrestlers from Mihogaseki stable who had already been under his wing. Kitanoumi stable became one of the largest in sumo, and produced a handful of top division wrestlers over the years, such as &quot;maegashira&quot; Ganyū, Kitazakura and Kitataiki. He also inherited Russian wrestler Hakurozan, who joined the stable in 2006.

In 2002 Kitanoumi became head of the Sumo Association. He was the first chairman under the age of 50 in half a century, and his appointment was widely welcomed; however, he came under pressure after a series of scandals hit sumo. These included the behavior of &quot;yokozuna&quot; Asashōryū, who was suspended for two tournaments in 2007 but then allowed to return to Mongolia, the death of junior wrestler Tokitaizan at Tokitsukaze stable, and the dismissal of several top wrestlers for using cannabis. When it became clear in September 2008 that one of them was his own wrestler Hakurozan, whom he had previously backed, Kitanoumi resigned his post, apologizing for &quot;the trouble I have caused to the Sumo Association and to fans&quot;. He remained on the board of directors, in charge of running the Osaka tournament, but had to resign from that position in April 2011 after another of his wrestlers, Kiyoseumi, was found guilty of match-fixing and forced to retire from sumo. After Hanaregoma stepped down in February 2012, Kitanoumi returned to the role of chairman, becoming the first person to head the association twice.

==Death==
Kitanoumi died of colorectal cancer and multiple organ failure on the evening of November 20, 2015. He was in Fukuoka for the Kyushu tournament and was taken to the hospital for anemia in the morning, after which his condition deteriorated. A memorial service was held on December 22 at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan.

==Fighting style==
Kitanoumi preferred to grip his opponent&#x27;s belt (&quot;yotsu-zumō&quot;) over pushing and thrusting. His favored grip was &quot;hidari-yotsu&quot; (the right hand outside of the opponent&#x27;s arm and the left hand inside holding the opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot;). His most common winning techniques (&quot;kimarite&quot;) were &quot;yorikiri&quot; (frontal force out), &quot;oshidashi&quot; (frontal push out), and &quot;uwatenage&quot; (overarm throw). He did not employ a wide variety of winning techniques, using only twenty-one different &quot;kimarite&quot; over the course of his career.

<text>Johann Kiefuss was a German inventor. He is sometimes credited with inventing the wheellock in Nuremberg in 1517. However, it is unlikely he was the actual inventor. The only traceable records of a Johann Kiefuss relate to a gun maker living in Nuremberg about 100 years later, so the misapprehension may be due to an incorrect transliteration of dates. His name is commonly linked to the gun, especially in German sources, from the late 18th century onwards. There is a possibility that Leonardo da Vinci was the inventor of the wheellock, but opinions remain divided.

<doc id="986091" wikidata="Q1623916" url="?curid=986091" title="Rat Islands">
<text>The Rat Islands (,) are a group of American volcanic islands in the Aleutian Islands in southwestern Alaska, between Buldir Island and the Near Islands group to its west, and Amchitka Pass and the Andreanof Islands group to its east. The islands in the group are, from west to east, Kiska, Little Kiska, Segula, Hawadax or Kryssei, Khvostof, Davidof, Little Sitkin, Amchitka, and Semisopochnoi. The total land area of the Rat Islands is 360.849 sq mi (934.594 km2). None of the islands are inhabited at present, but Amchitka Island was an Aleut territory until the end of the eighteenth century.

The name &quot;Rat Islands&quot; is the English translation of the name given to the islands by Captain Fyodor Petrovich Litke in 1827 when he visited the Aleutian Islands on a voyage around the world. The islands are named so because rats were accidentally introduced to Hawadax Island (formerly known as Rat Island) in about 1780. , after a government-funded eradication program, Rat Island is believed to be rat-free; it was renamed Hawadax Island in 2012. However, a post-operation assessment found that many of the island&#x27;s local bird populations were negatively impacted—there was a far higher-than-expected nontarget mortality. An internal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement investigation revealed that several laws may have been violated.

The Rat Islands are earthquake-prone as they are located on the boundary of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The 1965 Rat Islands earthquake was one of the largest in recorded history with a magnitude of 8.7.

<doc id="986092" wikidata="Q1798612" url="?curid=986092" title="Mercer University">
<text>Mercer University is a private research university in Macon, Georgia, United States. Founded in 1833 as Mercer Institute and gaining university status in 1837, it is the oldest private university in the state and enrolls more than 9,000 students in 12 colleges and schools. Mercer is a member of the Georgia Research Alliance. It is classified as a &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities — High research activity&quot;.

Mercer has four major campuses: the historic (main) campus in Macon, a graduate and professional campus in Atlanta, and four-year campuses of the School of Medicine in Savannah and Columbus. Mercer also has regional academic centers in Henry County and Douglas County; the Mercer University School of Law on its own campus in Macon; teaching hospitals in Macon, Savannah, and Columbus; a university press and a performing arts center, the Grand Opera House, in Macon; and the Mercer Engineering Research Center in Warner Robins. The Mercer University Health Sciences Center encompasses Mercer&#x27;s medical, pharmacy, nursing, and health professions programs in Macon, Atlanta, Savannah, and Columbus.

Mercer has an NCAA Division I athletic program and fields teams in eight men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s sports; all university-sponsored sports compete in the Southern Conference except women&#x27;s sand volleyball, which is not sponsored by the SoCon, and thus competes in the ASUN Conference.

==History==
===Founding and early years (1833–1959)===

Mercer University was founded in Penfield, Georgia, as a boys&#x27; preparatory school under Billington McCarter Sanders, a professor who served as the first president, and Adiel Sherwood, a Baptist minister who previously founded a boys&#x27; manual labor school that served as a model. The school opened as Mercer Institute with 39 students on January 14, 1833. The school was named for Jesse Mercer, a prominent Baptist leader who, along with Josiah Penfield, provided a founding endowment and who served as the first chairman of the board of trustees. The Georgia General Assembly granted a university charter in December 1837. Mercer adopted its present name in 1838 and graduated its first university class, of three students, in 1841. In 1871, Mercer moved to Macon, a center of transportation and commerce in Georgia.

The School of Law was established in 1873 and was named the Walter F. George School of Law in 1947 in honor of Mercer alumnus Walter F. George, class of 1901, who served as a United States senator from Georgia and as President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the United States Senate.

During World War II, Mercer was one of 131 colleges and universities in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered military training that prepared students for a commission in the United States Navy.

===Expansion (1959–2013)===
Mercer expanded to Atlanta in 1959 when the university absorbed the independent Southern School of Pharmacy. The College of Liberal Arts, the School of Law, and the Southern School of Pharmacy comprised the university until 1972 when Mercer merged with Atlanta Baptist College, which became Mercer&#x27;s Atlanta campus.

Atlanta Baptist College was founded in 1968 under the leadership of Dr. Monroe F. Swilley, a prominent Baptist educator. The college merged with Mercer in 1972 and became the College of Arts and Sciences, and in 1984 was named the Cecil B. Day College of Arts and Sciences. Mercer offered undergraduate liberal arts education in Atlanta until 1990 when the college closed. Faculty and students tried to prevent the closure, but were not successful. The mission of the Atlanta campus changed to graduate and professional education. The Southern School of Pharmacy moved in 1992 from its downtown location to the Cecil B. Day Graduate and Professional Campus.

Between 1982 and 2013, Mercer established nine additional colleges and schools: the School of Medicine in 1982, the Eugene W. Stetson School of Business and Economics in 1984, the School of Engineering in 1985, the James and Carolyn McAfee School of Theology in 1994, the Tift College of Education in 1995, the Georgia Baptist College of Nursing in 2001, the College of Continuing and Professional Studies in 2003 (renamed Penfield College of Mercer University in 2014), the Townsend School of Music in 2006, and the College of Health Professions in 2013. Mercer opened its second four-year medical school in Savannah in 2008 and the multi-campus Mercer University Health Sciences Center in 2012.

Mercer received a $5 million grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation in 2009 to support continued revitalization of the College Hill Corridor between campus and downtown Macon. The Mercer On Mission service-learning program, launched in 2007, has been recognized by the Clinton Global Initiative as &quot;an exemplary approach to addressing a specific global challenge.&quot; It helps students combine research, study abroad and service-learning under faculty direction.

The multi-campus Mercer University Health Sciences Center, which incorporates programs offered by the School of Medicine, the College of Pharmacy, the Georgia Baptist College of Nursing, and the new College of Health Professions, opened in 2013. The College of Health Professions, authorized by the board of trustees in 2012, is Mercer&#x27;s twelfth academic unit. Mercer purchased the former Georgia Music Hall of Fame building in downtown Macon in 2012; the extensively renovated building reopened in 2014 as the home of Mercer Medicine, a multi-specialty physician clinic and a division of the School of Medicine.

Mercer opened a large retail-residential center on the Macon campus in 2011. The center, called Mercer Lofts, houses the Barnes &amp; Noble operated university bookstore, other shops, and student apartments. Mercer Lofts II, a mixed-use development adjacent to Phase I, opened in 2012; the facility houses Mercer&#x27;s Center for Collaborative Journalism, which consists of the university&#x27;s journalism department and the editorial-professional staffs of the Macon Telegraph and Georgia Public Broadcasting (on the first floor) along with student apartments (on upper floors). Also in 2012, the university opened a new admissions and welcome center on the Macon campus; the center is named for Emily Parker Myers, a long-time university administrator, and is the university&#x27;s first LEED certified building. In 2013, Mercer completed Cruz Plaza, a major landscaping project for the Macon campus central quadrangle linking the University Center (Hawkins Arena), Tarver Library, and Connell Student Center.

====Desegregation====

Mercer University was the first college or university in Georgia to fully desegregate. In April 18, 1963, the board of trustees voted 13 to 5, with 3 abstentions, to ratify the policy that &quot;Mercer University considers all applications based on qualification, without consideration of race, color of skin, creed, or origin.&quot;. This policy change allowed Sam Oni, a twenty-two-year-old student from Ghana, to become the first Black student to attend Mercer University. Sam Oni, knowingly and intentionally, in part applied to Mercer for the purpose of helping to end racial segregation in the United States. As Sam Oni phrased it &quot;My role, as we conceived it was by breaking the color bar at Mercer, I would be challenging our Southern Baptist brothers and sisters in America to confront gross contradictions in the Christian witness at home and abroad.&quot; Sam Oni succeeded despite pressure from segregationist in both the South and the Southern Baptists to keep Mercer racially segregated, including an airplane flying a banner that read &quot;Keep Mercer Segregated&quot; as the Board of Trustees successfully voted to fully integrate.

====Religious affiliation====
In 2006, the Georgia Baptist Convention (Southern Baptist Convention) ended its affiliation with Mercer, after 173 years. Before the affiliation ended, Mercer had an independent board of trustees; the convention provided financial support but did not control the university. The lack of control caused friction, with Mercer resisting restraints on social issues while the Convention saw Mercer as becoming secularized and not conforming to its values. The Convention reportedly complained about the presence of a &quot;pro-gay student group&quot; at Mercer, and the university&#x27;s &quot;support for non-Southern Baptist organizations.&quot; 

Mercer&#x27;s theology school has a working relationship with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a more liberal group of Baptists. The denomination&#x27;s official records are stored at Mercer University, and the university is partnered with the denomination.

=== 2014–present ===
On October 31, 2014, Mercer announced an effort to raise $400 million, including $207 million for its endowment, $109 million for capital projects, and $84 million for operations. By its public launch, $90 million in gifts and pledges had been collected. The campaign aims to fund a $15 million medical education facility in Savannah, ground was broken on October 14, 2014; a $25 million undergraduate sciences facility in Macon; a $20 million health sciences building in Atlanta; a $3 million baseball stadium in Macon; additional endowment for faculty positions, academic programs and student scholarships; funding for programs and initiatives such as Mercer On Mission; and additional support throughout the university&#x27;s 12 schools and colleges, Mercer University Press, the university libraries, athletic department, and other administrative units.

In athletics, Mercer has added programs in men&#x27;s lacrosse, sand volleyball, and football; constructed a new football and lacrosse complex, named Five Star Stadium (10,200 seats); and changed affiliation to the Southern Conference. In 2014, Mercer set an enrollment record in the fall of 2014 with a university-wide population of 8,557 students. The larger student body reflects expanded academic programs including five new doctoral degrees: Doctor of Philosophy in Curriculum and Instruction, Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Philosophy in Clinical Medical Psychology. Mercer opened its second four-year medical school, in Savannah, in 2008.

Mercer opened Mercer Lofts III in 2014; the facility is a large student-housing complex on College Street next to Tattnall Square Park and the university&#x27;s historic north quadrangle. Also in 2014, Mercer completed an extensive renovation of the historic Amanda Bell House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places; the building houses the Robert McDuffie Center for Strings of the Townsend School of Music and is one of the finest conservatory facilities in the nation. Mercer&#x27;s television station, WMUB (Mercer University Broadcasting), opened a new studio in Mercer Village in 2014 as a part of the university&#x27;s Center for Collaborative Journalism.

The M. Diane Owens Garden, named for the first female chair of Mercer&#x27;s board of trustees, a large environmentally friendly fountain and garden area near Five Star Stadium, was dedicated in 2014. The garden complements Cruz Plaza, completed in 2013, as a major landscaping project beautifying the Macon campus.

Mercer Lofts IV, known as the Lofts at College Hill, opened in 2015; the housing-retail complex is designed for graduate and professional students and is located adjacent to Macon&#x27;s main post office between College Street and Interstate 75, near the Walter F. George School of Law. Mercer&#x27;s Tattnall Square Center for the Arts also opened in 2015; the center is the former Tattnall Square Presbyterian Church, near the historic north quadrangle, and now houses the university theater department and is a community performing arts center.

Mercer Lofts V, known as the Lofts at Mercer Landing, opened in 2016 adjacent to Five Star Stadium near the Mercer University Drive exit from Interstate 75; a new campus entrance and a pedestrian bridge connecting the campus and the complex are also complete. The facility provides student housing, university offices, and a large parking garage; retail-food facilities and a second on-campus hotel, operated by Marriott TownePlace Suites, are a part of the complex as well, located directly across Mercer University Drive from the university&#x27;s Hilton Garden Inn.

Mercer&#x27;s other construction projects in recent years include renovation and expansion of the School of Medicine facility in Savannah (completed 2016), a new undergraduate residence hall in Macon named Legacy Hall (completed 2016), and a renovated and enlarged baseball facility named OrthoGeorgia Park at Claude Smith Field (completed 2017).

Mercer&#x27;s Board of Trustees on April 20, 2018, approved a new strategic plan that succeeds the 2008 plan, which saw the institution reclassified as a national research university, admitted to the Georgia Research Alliance, granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, growth of 41 percent in undergraduate enrollment, a near doubling of research expenditures, investment of more than $200 million in new facilities, and an increase of endowment to more than $300 million. The 2018 strategic plan, titled &quot;Inspire: Mercer&#x27;s Vision for the Decade Ahead&quot;, has seven imperatives: be an intimate and diverse community of gifted scholars committed to changing the world; be a place of discovery and innovation; be a global university; be relevant; achieve meaningful outcomes; compete with the best, and be true to its heritage.

Mercer has launched second and third medical school campuses (in Savannah and Columbus), started a master&#x27;s-level physician assistant program and a doctoral-level program in physical therapy, and added doctoral programs in clinical psychology, nursing, counseling, educational leadership, and curriculum and instruction. Reflecting an increased emphasis on research, Mercer meets criteria established by the Carnegie Foundation for classification as a research-doctoral university; the number of doctoral students has increased from fewer than 35 to more than 250. In addition, annual externally funded research expenditures now exceed $36 million due to increased funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Georgia Research Alliance; plus new funding as eminent cancer scientists by the Georgia Cancer Coalition.

Mercer students have earned national recognition and prestigious Fulbright, Goldwater, Teach For America and Peace Corps scholarships and appointments; , two of the last three recipients of the Gulf South Summit Award for Outstanding Student Contributions to Service-Learning have been Mercer students and Mercer ranks among the top three institutions in the Southeast for placement of Peace Corps volunteers among colleges and universities with fewer than 5,000 undergraduate students.

The University dedicated in April 2018 the new $44 million Godsey Science Center. The largest academic facility project in the university&#x27;s history, the science center includes 60 teaching and research labs, three medium classrooms (75 to 100 students each), four small classrooms (32 students each) and 46 offices for Mercer&#x27;s biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and neuroscience programs.

Mercer began construction on Phase II of the Mercer Landing development in early 2018. The project, located adjacent to the residential loft complex completed in 2016, will provide more student housing and more parking for the complex and for Five Star Stadium, which is located across Mercer University Drive.

The Mercer Cluster, commonly referred to as &quot;The Cluster&quot;, is a student-run, editorially-independent news organization for Mercer&#x27;s main Macon campus. The organization began as a newspaper in 1920 and was named after a book of songs penned by the university&#x27;s founder Jesse Mercer in 1810. The Cluster&#x27;s website went live in 2011, and both print and digital publication were maintained until 2022, when the news publication announced it would be transitioning to digital-only. Today, The Cluster&#x27;s website publishes consistently throughout the academic year.

===Debating Societies===
Founded in 1897, Mercer&#x27;s debating society is the oldest organization on Mercer&#x27;s campus as well as the oldest debating society in the entire state of Georgia. In 1898, Mercer&#x27;s champion orator, John Roach Straton, won the first Intercollegiate Oratorical Championships in Atlanta. Debate continued to be a significant intercollegiate sport for many years after that, with Walter F. George, namesake of Mercer&#x27;s law school, leading a team to victory over the University of Georgia at the Mercer-Athens Debate in 1899.

In March 2018, the student team of Jazmine Buckley and Kyle Bligen became the first all-African-American duo to win the National Parliamentary Debate championship at the nation&#x27;s largest parliamentary debate tournament. Buckley as a freshman in 2015 became the first freshman and the first African-American to be named top speaker at the NPDA tournament. Buckley outranked 320 other debaters representing top programs such as the University of California, Berkeley, Wheaton, Rice and Whitman to receive the James &quot;Al&quot; Johnson Top Speaker Award. That same year, Lindsey Hancock and Hunter Pilkinton competed at the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE) at William Jewell College in Missouri. The duo from Mercer was the first team from the university and the state of Georgia to attend the NPTE, the most prestigious parliamentary debate tournament in the nation. Also in 2015, the Hancock-Pilkinton duo became the first Mercer team to win the Georgia Parliamentary Debate Association State Championships, with Hancock being the first woman to win the state title.

==Athletics==

Mercer fields eighteen (18) teams, known as the Bears, on the NCAA Division I level (FCS, formerly I-AA, for football); all teams compete in the Southern Conference except women&#x27;s sand volleyball, which is not sponsored by the SoCon, and thus competes in the ASUN Conference. Men&#x27;s teams include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, and tennis. Women&#x27;s teams include basketball, cross-country, golf, lacrosse, sand volleyball, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

Mercer was a charter member of the ASUN Conference, originally called the Trans American Athletic Conference, from 1978 to 2014. Mercer teams won 21 Atlantic Sun championships: five baseball, six men&#x27;s basketball, two women&#x27;s basketball, five men&#x27;s soccer, and one each in women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s lacrosse, and men&#x27;s golf. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2012 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament and in 2014 defeated Duke in the first round of the NCAA tournament.

===Facilities===
Mercer opened the University Center on the Macon campus in 2004. The $40 million center houses Mercer&#x27;s athletics department, a 3,500-seat basketball arena, an indoor pool, work-out facilities, intramural basketball courts, a food court, and numerous meeting facilities. Mercer&#x27;s baseball, softball, and intramural fields are next to the center along with the university&#x27;s tennis complex and football-lacrosse complex. The basketball arena was named Hawkins Arena in 2012; the naming honors J. B. Hawkins, former high school athletic director and basketball coach in Crawford County, Georgia.

Mercer opened the Tony and Nancy Moye Football and Lacrosse Complex (10,200 seats) in 2013. The stadium is adjacent to the University Center and Mercer&#x27;s other athletic facilities. On February 26, 2015, the stadium portion of the complex was named Five Star Stadium in recognition of a multimillion-dollar financial commitment to Mercer athletics by Five Star Automotive Group, which owns dealerships in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.

Hilton Garden Inn operates a 101-room hotel on university-owned land adjacent to the University Center and the Moye Complex.

Mercer&#x27;s facilities are located next to Interstate 75. Large parking lots are available for visitors-spectators arriving via the Mercer University Drive exit.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
Mercer received national attention in 2014 when the men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Duke University in the second round of the NCAA Tournament; the team was defeated by the University of Tennessee in the third round. The team finished the season with a 27–9 record, Mercer&#x27;s third straight with more than 20 victories. In honor of its win over Duke, Mercer received the 2014 Espy Award for Best Upset.

===Football===

On November 19, 2010, Mercer announced the reinstatement of intercollegiate football beginning in the fall of 2013. The university competed as an NCAA Division I, non-scholarship program in the Pioneer Football League in 2013, and is now a scholarship program in the Southern Conference. Reinstatement came after a 70-year hiatus; Mercer suspended football during World War II and did not revive it. The final game was in 1941.

Mercer played its first game in 72 years on August 31, 2013; the team defeated Reinhardt University before an overflow crowd (12,172 spectators) at the Tony and Nancy Moye Football and Lacrosse Complex. Mercer finished the 2013 season undefeated at home with a 10–2 win–loss record (the two road losses were to the University of San Diego and Marist College) setting an NCAA Division I record for wins (10) by a start-up football program; Mercer had eight home wins, also an NCAA Division I record tied the same year (2013) by Auburn University, the FBS national runner-up, and Sam Houston State University who achieved its eighth victory in the FCS post-season.

Mercer won its first Southern Conference game on September 27, 2014; the team defeated Virginia Military Institute on the road in Lexington, Virginia. Mercer finished the season with an overall 6–6 win–loss record (1–5 in the conference) with only half the team on scholarship due to start-up restrictions.

==People==
Mercer alumni include former Governor of Georgia Nathan Deal, the Chief Justice of Georgia, three members of the Georgia Court of Appeals including the Chief Judge, the Mayor of Macon, and the President of the State Bar of Georgia.

Mercer University alumni also include 21 United States Representatives, 12 governors, four United States Senators, two Pulitzer Prize winners, two Rhodes Scholars and a U.S. Attorney General.

<doc id="986096" wikidata="Q1406417" url="?curid=986096" title="Fermi surface">
<text>In condensed matter physics, the Fermi surface is the surface in reciprocal space which separates occupied electron states from unoccupied electron states at zero temperature. The shape of the Fermi surface is derived from the periodicity and symmetry of the crystalline lattice and from the occupation of electronic energy bands. The existence of a Fermi surface is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows a maximum of one electron per quantum state. The study of the Fermi surfaces of materials is called fermiology.

== Theory ==

Consider a spin-less ideal Fermi gas of formula_1 particles. According to Fermi–Dirac statistics, the mean occupation number of a state with energy formula_2 is given by
: formula_3
where
* formula_4 is the mean occupation number of the formula_5th state
* formula_2 is the kinetic energy of the formula_5th state
* formula_8 is the chemical potential (at zero temperature, this is the maximum kinetic energy the particle can have, i.e. Fermi energy formula_9)
* formula_10 is the absolute temperature
* formula_11 is the Boltzmann constant

Suppose we consider the limit formula_12. Then we have,
: formula_13

By the Pauli exclusion principle, no two fermions can be in the same state. Additionally, at zero temperature the enthalpy of the electrons must be minimal, meaning that they cannot change state. If, for a particle in some state, there existed an unoccupied lower state that it could occupy, then the energy difference between those states would give the electron an additional enthalpy. Hence, the enthalpy of the electron would not be minimal. Therefore, at zero temperature all the lowest energy states must be saturated. For a large ensemble the Fermi level will be approximately equal to the chemical potential of the system, and hence every state below this energy must be occupied. Thus, particles fill up all energy levels below the Fermi level at absolute zero, which is equivalent to saying that is the energy level below which there are exactly formula_1 states.

In momentum space, these particles fill up a ball of radius formula_15, the surface of which is called the Fermi surface.

The linear response of a metal to an electric, magnetic, or thermal gradient is determined by the shape of the Fermi surface, because currents are due to changes in the occupancy of states near the Fermi energy. In reciprocal space, the Fermi surface of an ideal Fermi gas is a sphere of radius
: formula_16,
determined by the valence electron concentration where formula_17 is the reduced Planck constant. A material whose Fermi level falls in a gap between bands is an insulator or semiconductor depending on the size of the bandgap. When a material&#x27;s Fermi level falls in a bandgap, there is no Fermi surface.

Materials with complex crystal structures can have quite intricate Fermi surfaces. Figure 2 illustrates the anisotropic Fermi surface of graphite, which has both electron and hole pockets in its Fermi surface due to multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy along the formula_18 direction. Often in a metal, the Fermi surface radius formula_15 is larger than the size of the first Brillouin zone, which results in a portion of the Fermi surface lying in the second (or higher) zones. As with the band structure itself, the Fermi surface can be displayed in an extended-zone scheme where formula_20 is allowed to have arbitrarily large values or a reduced-zone scheme where wavevectors are shown modulo formula_21 (in the 1-dimensional case) where a is the lattice constant. In the three-dimensional case the reduced zone scheme means that from any wavevector formula_20 there is an appropriate number of reciprocal lattice vectors formula_23 subtracted that the new formula_20 now is closer to the origin in formula_20-space than to any formula_23. Solids with a large density of states at the Fermi level become unstable at low temperatures and tend to form ground states where the condensation energy comes from opening a gap at the Fermi surface. Examples of such ground states are superconductors, ferromagnets, Jahn–Teller distortions and spin density waves.

The state occupancy of fermions like electrons is governed by Fermi–Dirac statistics so at finite temperatures the Fermi surface is accordingly broadened. In principle all fermion energy level populations are bound by a Fermi surface although the term is not generally used outside of condensed-matter physics.

== Experimental determination ==
Electronic Fermi surfaces have been measured through observation of the oscillation of transport properties in magnetic fields formula_27, for example the de Haas–van Alphen effect (dHvA) and the Shubnikov–de Haas effect (SdH). The former is an oscillation in magnetic susceptibility and the latter in resistivity. The oscillations are periodic versus formula_28 and occur because of the quantization of energy levels in the plane perpendicular to a magnetic field, a phenomenon first predicted by Lev Landau. The new states are called Landau levels and are separated by an energy formula_29 where formula_30 is called the cyclotron frequency, formula_31 is the electronic charge, formula_32 is the electron effective mass and formula_33 is the speed of light. In a famous result, Lars Onsager proved that the period of oscillation formula_34 is related to the cross-section of the Fermi surface (typically given in Å−2) perpendicular to the magnetic field direction formula_35 by the equationformula_36. Thus the determination of the periods of oscillation for various applied field directions allows mapping of the Fermi surface. Observation of the dHvA and SdH oscillations requires magnetic fields large enough that the circumference of the cyclotron orbit is smaller than a mean free path. Therefore, dHvA and SdH experiments are usually performed at high-field facilities like the High Field Magnet Laboratory in Netherlands, Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France, the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory in Japan or the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in the United States.

The most direct experimental technique to resolve the electronic structure of crystals in the momentum-energy space (see reciprocal lattice), and, consequently, the Fermi surface, is the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). An example of the Fermi surface of superconducting cuprates measured by ARPES is shown in Figure 3.

With positron annihilation it is also possible to determine the Fermi surface as the annihilation process conserves the momentum of the initial particle. Since a positron in a solid will thermalize prior to annihilation, the annihilation radiation carries the information about the electron momentum. The corresponding experimental technique is called angular correlation of electron positron annihilation radiation (ACAR) as it measures the angular deviation from of both annihilation quanta. In this way it is possible to probe the electron momentum density of a solid and determine the Fermi surface. Furthermore, using spin polarized positrons, the momentum distribution for the two spin states in magnetized materials can be obtained. ACAR has many advantages and disadvantages compared to other experimental techniques: It does not rely on UHV conditions, cryogenic temperatures, high magnetic fields or fully ordered alloys. However, ACAR needs samples with a low vacancy concentration as they act as effective traps for positrons. In this way, the first determination of a &quot;smeared Fermi surface&quot; in a 30% alloy was obtained in 1978.

<doc id="986103" wikidata="Q963716" url="?curid=986103" title="Raymond du Puy">
<text>Raymond du Puy (c. 1083–1160) was a knight from Dauphiné then in the Holy Roman Empire and the second master of the Knights Hospitaller, also known as the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, from around 1121 until 1160. Officially, he succeeded Blessed Gerard, the founder of the Order, as master. While traditionally cited as the direct successor upon Gerard&#x27;s death in 1118 or 1120, his assumption of the magisterium was in 1121 or 1123 after one or two interim superiors, Pierre de Barcelona and Boyant Roger. Raymond divided the membership of the Order into clerical, military, and serving brothers and established the first significant Hospitaller infirmary near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

==Transformation of the Hospitallers==

Information on Hospitaller activity during Raymond&#x27;s early years as Grand Master is limited and in those years, the Hospitaller were dedicated to a social mission. The first mention of their assuming a more militant role is related to the Crusader castle built at Bethgibelin, erected by Fulk of Jerusalem in 1135 as part of a string of fortifications to protect the kingdom. It commanded the road from Ascalon to Hebron, and in 1136, the king donated the castle to the Order for them to see to its operation and maintenance.

It was under Raymond that the Order took on a more military character. An act of 17 January 1126 gives us the name of a constable of the Hospitallers, a certain Durand, who seems to have military responsibilities. Nineteenth-century depictions also show Raymond in battle as early as 1130 (see Representations below). From 1137 onwards, the Order appeared in the wars that the troops of the kingdom of Jerusalem waged against the Muslims. Attacked from all sides, the kingdom of Jerusalem could hardly stand up to its enemies. Ascalon, because of its position on the seashore on the way to Egypt, was a permanent danger for the Christians, and the enemy made continuous incursions into the southern part of the kingdom. On the advice of Fulk, the Franks decided to fortify the position of Hisn Ibn Akkar, which belonged to the Hospitallers and was located east of Ascalon. The work, directed with speed by William of Malines, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, was naturally entrusted to the Hospitallers, who were placed in a vanguard position.
==Dealings with Spain==
In 1140, Raymond went to Spain to settle the territorial grant that the Hospitallers had obtained from Alfonso the Battler, king of Aragon and Navarre. Alfonso, without an heir, had made the Hospitallers, the Knights Templar and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre his legatees. When he died in the fall of 1134, the will was not respected. Charged with representing the three orders, Raymond came to Spain and began negotiations with Ramon Berenguer IV. The group relinquished their territorial rights, unless Berenguer died without issue. In exchange, they obtained the royal rights in Barbastro, Calatayud, Daroca, Huesca, Jaca, Zaragoza and all the towns that Aragon would later conquer, as well as in all the castles and towns of the kingdom with more than thirty peasants. The Hospitallers reserved the land necessary to build a church and a settlement in Jaca. On 24 June 1158, pope Adrian IV confirmed this agreement at the request of Berenguer.

In April 1157, Raymond went to Portugal to renew the will of Alfonso. The presence of the Grand Master of the Order earned him, in addition to what he had already obtained 17 years earlier, enormous gifts from Ramon Berenguer IV and the bishop of Lérida. At the end of the year he was in Estopiñán del Castillo in Aragon and in the south of France where the abbot of Saint-Gilles, a certain Bertrand, gave permission to build a chapel. Pierre II de Posquières, the bishop of Lodève, gave him the churches of Saint-Julien and Saint-Vincent de Nébian. In July 1158, he met with Guichard of Pontigny, archbishop of Lyon and Guy II, count of Forez, to obtain, on 16 July 1158, an exemption from tolls by land and by water. On 25 October 1158, Raymond was near Verona where he obtained from Frederick Barbarossa a general confirmation of the exemption.
==In the Holy Land==
In 1143, pope Celestine II issued a bull that gave the Hospitallers jurisdiction over the &quot;Santa Maria Alemanna&quot; (Church of Saint Mary of the Germans) in Jerusalem, a hospital that since 1128 accommodated German pilgrims and Crusaders who could neither speak the local language nor Latin. Although formally an institution of the Hospitallers, the pope commanded that the prior and the brothers of the &quot;domus Theutonicorum&quot; (house of the Germans) should always be Germans themselves, so a tradition of a German-led religious institution could develop during the 12th century in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The latter, who gained their independence in 1190, remained under the responsibility of the Hospitallers until 1229.

Following the example of the Knights Templar, he was to develop protection for pilgrims by providing them with security in their travels to the Holy Places. Little by little, he hired knights and men-at-arms as mercenaries and participated, through intermediaries, in the defense of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The political importance of the Grand Master increased, since in June 1148 at the Council of Acre, he was among the princes who took the decision to undertake the Siege of Damascus. In the Holy Land, the influence of the Hospitallers became preponderant with a decisive role taken in military operations with an increasingly prominent presence due to the government of Raymond. He is also said to have taken over the management of the &quot;leprosarium&quot; outside Jerusalem that eventually broke off from the Order to become the Order of Saint Lazarus, becoming its seventh Grand Master just before his death.

Amidst the Siege of Ascalon in 1153, a truce was held to enable each side to bury its dead. Baldwin III of Jerusalem held a council in his tent, with a relic of the True Cross present. After five months of siege, the position of the Franks did not improve. An Egyptian fleet had dispersed the Latin fleet, the Templars had suffered a serious defeat during the assault, and a good part of the knights had been massacred. The lay nobles, discouraged by the reverse, wished to abandon the siege; but Raymond and Fulk of Angoulême, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, persuaded the king to continue, a position that moved the barons. The attack was renewed more vigorously than before and, three days later, on 19 August 1153, the besieged capitulated and the following day they evacuated the city.

In 1156, Nūr-ad-Din and his brother Nasr-ad-Din routed a force of Hospitaller near their stronghold Qalaat el-Marqab close to Banyas. After a peace treaty was broken by Baldwin III in February 1157, the constable of Jerusalem, Humphrey II of Toron, to whom Banyas and the surrounding country belonged, had to face the Zengids. He quickly realized that his forces alone would not be enough and called upon the Hospitallers. He exchanged their participation for half of Banyas and the castles that depended on this city. His army, composed of a large foot force, was 700 strong, including the Hospitallers. But this did not prevent the defeat near Ras el Ma on April 24, which led to the conquest of Banyas on 10 May 1157, which Humphrey and the Hospitallers could not prevent. They were only able to defend the castle, which Baldwin III was able to supply in order to maintain its and leave a garrison there. On 19 June, the king was surprised on his way back through Jacob&#x27;s Ford and routed. He managed to return to Safed and then to Acre. Humphrey later sold Banyas and the castle Chastel Neuf to the Hospitallers.

After the siege, a conflict broke out between Raymond and Fulk of Angoulême. The latter complained that the Hospitallers did not respect his ecclesiastical rights. He accused them of admitting excommunicated persons, administering the last rites and burying them in their cemeteries, ringing bells in &quot;forbidden countries or times&quot;, receiving alms, providing for the Order&#x27;s cures without diocesan approval and refusing to pay tithes on their goods and revenues. The patriarch pleaded for himself, but also for the whole patriarchate, whose prerogatives had been infringed. In addition to all this, there were personal considerations. The Order&#x27;s hospital, installed opposite the Holy Sepulchre, competed with it by the beauty and height of its buildings, but also, when the patriarch preached, his voice was covered by the Hospitallers&#x27; bells. The Hospitallers had seen fit to respond by invading the Holy Sepulchre with an armed force. Fulk resolved to go before Adrian IV and ask for the withdrawal of the bull of pope Anastasius IV of 21 October 1154, which confirmed the prerogatives of the Order. Fulk, accompanied by the archbishops of Tyre and Caesarea, the bishops of Acre, Sidon, Lydda, Sebaste and Tiberias, left for Rome in the spring of 1155. After many travails, a new disappointment awaited them, as the pope had left Rome for Ferentino. When they finally saw the pope, he welcomed them coldly, although they did accompany him at the religious festivals. Their case was pleaded before the pope, finishing in endless debates. Fulk, understanding the uselessness of his attempt, returned to Jerusalem in autumn 1155.

==Administration of Crusader castles==
Under his magisterium, the Order received numerous donations, notably from the county of Tripoli, to defend the Holy Land against the Muslims. It was under his mastery that the Hospitallers received its first concessions of castles: Bethgibelin in 1136, Qalaat el-Marqab, Chastel Neuf and, later, the Krak des Chevaliers in 1142/1144. The Order also obtained numerous privileges and exemptions from the papacy, providing it with the financial resources necessary for its independence and giving it freedom from the diocesan authorities, much to their displeasure.

Raymond du Puy gave the Hospitaller its first statutes, bearing his name. It is very likely that there was a rule, or what served as a rule, before him, but there is no such record. What is certain is that it predates 1153. Indeed, it was approved by pope Eugene III after 1145 and before 7 July 1153, the date of his death. It is possible to say that then, and only then, did the Hospitaller become an order.

Raymond also introduced the Order&#x27;s Great Seal, or &quot;leaden bulla&quot;, that remained in use, with some modifications, from the 12th century until 1798. Until 1278, when Nicholas de Lorgne introduced a separate &quot;conventual bulla&quot;, there was no distinction between the seal of the Grand Master and that of the Order. The general design of the seal featured, on the obverse, the Grand Master kneeling in prayer before the patriarchal cross. This image was usually accompanied with the sacred letters alpha and omega, which referenced the Second Coming of Christ. The central image was surrounded by a legend with the Master&#x27;s name followed by the official designation CVSTOS.
==Final years==
The last mention of Raymond du Puy dates from 25 October 1158 in Verona and the first mention of his successor is from 29 November 1160. According to the &quot;Cartulaire général de l&#x27;Ordre des Hospitaliers,&quot; Numbers 70, 136 and 527:

History has left us with nothing on his end, whether he died during his journey or on his return to the Holy Land, we know nothing about it. He was succeeded by Auger de Balben.

==Representations==

In the rooms of the &quot;Salles des Croisades&quot; (Hall of Crusades) at the Château de Versailles, there is a full-length portrait of Raymond du Puy painted in 1842 by Alexandre Laemlein in the Third Room of the hall. In the Second Room, there are two battle scenes: &quot;Defense of Celesyria by Raymond Dupuy&quot; painted by Édouard Cibot in 1844; and &quot;Raymond of Puy takes body of Turks as prisoners&quot; by an unknown artist. Both scenes represent military action in Syria around 1130. All the representations of Raymond du Puy are works of the imagination, which are naturally not based on any period source.

Also in the rooms of the &quot;Salles des Croisades&quot; are his coat of arms is given as follows: &quot;Écartelé aux 1 et 4 de gueules à la croix d’argent&quot; &quot;et aux 2 et 3 d’or au lion de gueules&quot; (qui est du Puy). This attribution is not based on any period source, as original documents for the great masters of the twelfth century do not exist.

A medal, reported in the eighteenth century, was engraved in his honor with the inscription: ROGATE LEGES AUSPICE.

Four stamps were printed by the &quot;Poste Magistrali&quot; of the Sovereign Order of Malta: in 1969, stamp of a scudo where Raymond du Puy is represented in bust, following a representation of Jean-François Cars, around 1725; in 1976, stamp of 90 grani where Raymond du Puy is represented in foot, following a representation of Bosio; in 1979, stamp of a scudo with the supposed coat of arms of Raymond du Puy, following a reproduction of the room of the crusades of the museum of Versailles; in 2004, stamp of a tari in homage to Raymond du Puy, resuming, by modifying it, the tomb described by L. F. de Villeneuve-Bargemont27. These stamps of the magisterial post are not recognized by the Universal Postal Union (UPU).

As we know neither when nor where Raymond du Puy died, we know nothing about his tomb. L. F. de Villeneuve-Bargemont proposes an engraved representation of a tomb or a cenotaph, with a sculpture that represents him seated, with the inscription: He was the first grand master of the hospital, after a weak beginning, and he instituted for his order ceremonies of worship, and gave him the black cloak.

<text>The Near Islands or Sasignan Islands (, ) are a group of American islands in the Aleutian Islands in southwestern Alaska, between the Russian Commander Islands to the west and the Rat Islands to the east.

==Geography==
The largest of the Near Islands are Attu and Agattu, which shelter a few rocks in the channel between them. The other important islands are the Semichi Islands to their northeast, notable among which are Alaid, Nizki and Shemya.

About to the east-southeast from Shemya are small rocky reefs known as the Ingenstrem Rocks.

The total land area of all of the Near Islands is 1,143.785 km2 (441.618 sq mi), and their total population was 47 persons as of the 2000 census. The only populated island is Shemya; the U.S. Coast Guard station on Attu closed in 2010 and all inhabitants left the island later that year.

On July 17, 2017, a major earthquake with a moment magnitude of 7.7 struck the Aleutian arc, with an epicenter west of Attu. The earthquake produced a measurable tsunami that was detected at tide gauges across the Pacific ocean; a tide gauge located at Shemya, Alaska measured a tsunami height of .

==History==

The islands were named &quot;Near Islands&quot; by Russian explorers in the 18th century because they were the nearest of the Aleutian Islands to Russia (that is, if one excludes the Commander Islands).

During the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Near Islands in 1942, being the first foreign military to occupy American soil since the War of 1812. American forces retook the islands during the Aleutian Islands Campaign in 1943.

<doc id="986128" wikidata="Q3655573" url="?curid=986128" title="Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls">
<text>The men&#x27;s single sculls competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics took place at Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre, Greece. The event was held from 14 to 21 August and was one of six events for male competitors in Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. There were 29 competitors from 29 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Olaf Tufte of Norway. Silver went to Jüri Jaanson of Estonia, with bronze to Ivo Yanakiev of Bulgaria. It was the first medal in the men&#x27;s single sculls for all three nations. Marcel Hacker&#x27;s failure to make the final made this the first men&#x27;s single sculls race since 1956 without a German rower on the podium; between the United Team of Germany, East Germany, West Germany, and Germany, the German medal streak in the event had been 11 Games long.

==Background==

This was the 24th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.

Six of the 24 single scullers from the 2000 Games returned: bronze medallist Marcel Hacker of Germany, fifth-place finisher Ivo Yanakiev of Bulgaria, sixth-place finisher Jüri Jaanson of Estonia, eleventh-place finisher Václav Chalupa of the Czech Republic, twelfth-place finisher Ali Ibrahim of Egypt, and thirteenth-place finisher Anderson Nocetti of Brazil. Jaanson, Chalupa, and Ibrahim had also competed in 1996; Chalupa had won a silver medal in 1992, with Jaanson finishing fifth that year. Hacker and Olaf Tufte were favored, with defending champion Rob Waddell of New Zealand and runner-up Xeno Müller of Switzerland retired and Iztok Čop of Slovenia competing only in the double sculls. Hacker, Tufte, Čop, and Chalupa had taken all 12 of the World Championships medals since the last Games, with Tufte winning in 2001 and 2003 and Hacker in 2002. 

The People&#x27;s Republic of China, Chinese Taipei, India, Kenya, Paraguay, Peru, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 19th appearance, tying the absent United States for most among nations.

==Competition format==

This rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The &quot;scull&quot; portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having multiple possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. 

During the first round six quarterfinal heats, each with 4 or 5 boats, were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the A/B/C semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages.

The repechages offered the rowers another chance to qualify for the top semifinals. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would race in. Six heats were held, with 3 or 4 boats each. The top two boats in each repechage moved on to the A/B/C semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the D/E semifinals (and out of medal contention).

Five semifinals were held: three of the A/B/C semifinals and two of the D/E semifinals. For each A/B/C semifinal race, the top two boats advanced to the A final to compete for medals. The next two boats (3rd and 4th in each semifinal) went to the B final. The last two boats went to the C final. For the D/E semifinals, the top three boats in each semifinal went to the D final while the remaining boats went to the E final.

The fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in either the top one of their quarterfinal or top two of their repechage heat and top two of their A/B/C semifinal to reach the A final.

===Semifinals===

The semifinals were conducted on 18 August. The A, B, and C semifinals were for those rowers who still had a chance at medaling, and the top two in each of those semifinals moved on to the A final (top 6 places), the next two to the B final (places 7–12), and the bottom two in each to the C final (13–18). The D and E semifinals were consolation semis and the rowers in them had already been eliminated from medal contention; the top three in each moved to the D final (places 19–24) and the rest moved to E final (places 25–29).

Three of the four favored scullers, Václav Chalupa, Jüri Jaanson and Olaf Tufte, all qualified relatively easily for the finals from Semis A, B and C, respectively. But in a major surprise, Marcel Hacker, who was in Semi B with Tufte, finished third and failed to qualify. Hacker was the returning bronze medallist, a former World Champion, and holder of the World&#x27;s best time. Ivo Yanakiev, who finished second in Semi B, went on to win a bronze medal.

====Semifinal D/E 1====

====Semifinal D/E 2====

===Finals===

Finals were contested on 19 August, except for the medal final on 21 August.

In the finals, Václav Chalupa followed by Fernandez and Maeyens pulled out to an early lead. At the 1000 meter mark (halfway), Olaf Tufte grabbed a small lead over Chalupa with Jüri Jaanson a close third. With 500 meters to go, Jaanson took a small lead over Tufte. Two seconds back (one length), Chalupa held a small lead for third over Ivo Yanakiev who had been slowly moving up through the field. In the final 500 meters, Tufte regained the lead and pulled away to win by a length over Jaanson. Meanwhile, Yanakiev grabbed third over Chalupa who faded to fifth place.

<text>Geoffrey William Marcy (born September 29, 1954) is an American astronomer. He was an early influence in the field of exoplanet detection, discovery, and characterization. Marcy was a professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and an adjunct professor of physics and astronomy at San Francisco State University. Marcy and his research teams discovered many extrasolar planets, including 70 out of the first 100 known exoplanets and also the first planetary system around a Sun-like star, Upsilon Andromedae. Marcy was a co-investigator on the NASA Kepler space telescope mission. His collaborators have included R. Paul Butler, Debra Fischer and Steven S. Vogt, Jason Wright, Andrew Howard, Katie Peek, John Johnson, Erik Petigura, Lauren Weiss, Lea Hirsch and the Kepler Science Team. Following an investigation for sexual harassment in 2015, Marcy resigned his position at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Early life and education==
Marcy graduated from Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, California, in 1972. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a double major in physics and astronomy from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1976. He then completed a doctorate in astronomy in 1982 at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with much of his work done at Lick Observatory.

==Academic career==
Marcy has held teaching and research positions, first at the Carnegie Institution of Washington (then the Mt. Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories) as a Carnegie fellow from 1982 to 1984. He then worked as an associate professor of physics and astronomy from 1984 to 1996 and then as a distinguished university professor from 1997 to 1999 at the San Francisco State University.

Marcy was a professor of astronomy and the Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair for SETI at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1999 through 2015. From 2000 to 2012, he was the director of UC Berkeley&#x27;s Center for Integrative Planetary Science. Marcy was also one of the project leaders of the Breakthrough Initiatives that will search for intelligent life in the universe, using large radio and optical telescopes.

Marcy and his team confirmed Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz&#x27;s discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star—51 Pegasi b. Two months later, Marcy and his team announced the discovery of two additional planets around 47 Ursae Majoris and 70 Virginis. Other achievements include discovering the first multiple planet system around a star similar to our own (Upsilon Andromedae), the first transiting planet around another star, simultaneously with David Charbonneau and Timothy Brown (HD209458b), the first extrasolar planet orbiting beyond five AU (55 Cancri d), and the first Neptune-sized planets (Gliese 436b and 55 Cancri e). Marcy was a co-investigator of the NASA Kepler mission that discovered over 4000 exoplanets, most being smaller than four times the size of Earth. His team, led by Erik Petigura and Andrew Howard, showed that approximately 20% of Sun-like stars have a planet of one to two times the size of Earth and receive incident stellar light within a factor of four of the light the Earth receives from the Sun, making them warm planets, many of which accommodate liquid water.

===Later career===
In May 2017, Marcy co-authored studies related to laser light emissions from stars, as a way of detecting technology-related signals from an alien civilization. The study included Tabby&#x27;s Star (KIC 8462852), an oddly dimming star whose unusual light fluctuations may be the result of interference by an artificial megastructure, such as a Dyson swarm, made by such a civilization. No evidence was found for technology-related signals from Tabby&#x27;s Star in the studies.

In 2021, Marcy&#x27;s membership in the National Academy of Sciences was rescinded.

==Sexual harassment==
A six-month investigation by the University of California, Berkeley, Title IX office concluded in 2015 with the finding that Geoffrey Marcy had violated the university&#x27;s sexual harassment policy between 2001 and 2010. Four complaints were filed with the university&#x27;s Title IX office, one of which Marcy denied. As a consequence, the university &quot;imposed real consequences on Professor Geoff Marcy by establishing a zero tolerance policy regarding future behavior and by stripping him of the procedural protections that all other faculty members enjoy&quot;.

At least three additional allegations had been made against Marcy as early as 1995 while he was at San Francisco State University, as corroborated by Penny Nixon, then SFSU&#x27;s sexual harassment officer. A former graduate student of Marcy, now faculty member at Harvard, called Marcy&#x27;s harassing behavior an &quot;open secret&quot; in the astronomy community. Marcy&#x27;s alleged actions included unwanted massages, kisses, and groping.

On October 7, 2015, Geoff Marcy posted an &quot;Open Letter to the Astronomy Community&quot; stating &quot;While I do not agree with each complaint that was made, it is clear that my behavior was unwelcomed by some women. I take full responsibility and hold myself completely accountable for my actions and the impact they had. For that and to the women affected, I sincerely apologize.&quot;

On October 12, 2015, the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department met and released a statement asserting that Marcy was &quot;inadequately disciplined&quot; by the university, and &quot;we believe that Geoff Marcy cannot perform the functions of a faculty member.&quot;

On the same day, Marcy resigned as principal investigator of the Breakthrough Listen project. Two days later, on October 14, 2015, he indicated his intention to step down from his professorship at UC Berkeley. Marcy retained the title of emeritus despite his resignation.

In 2023, a paper co-authored by Marcy with the American Astronomical Society drew criticism from graduate students who had collected data for the project but were not offered co-authorship. As harassment, including sexual harassment, is not classified as research misconduct by the group, Marcy&#x27;s name was not disincluded from the paper. One of Marcy&#x27;s junior collaborators in Sweden published an essay stating that she is subjected to harassment, bullying, and discrimination from the astronomy community for her decision to work with Marcy.

==Personal==
Marcy lives with his wife, Susan Kegley, in California.

==In the media==
Earlier, and as a pioneer in the study of extrasolar planets, Marcy has been featured prominently in the media, including &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Astronomy magazine&quot; and as a participant in various PBS &quot;Nova&quot; episodes: &quot;Hunt for Alien Worlds&quot; (1997), &quot;Finding Life Beyond Earth&quot; (2012), &quot;Alien Planets Revealed&quot; (2014); a BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; episode: &quot;The Planet Hunters&quot; (1996) and History Channel programs: &quot;The Universe&quot; (2007). Marcy was also featured on ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; (October 20, 1995), &quot;The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour&quot; (January 18, 1996), &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; (April 12, 2001), a &quot;Planetary Radio&quot; interview (2007) and a National Academy of Sciences interview (2014).

<text>In particle physics, the Peccei–Quinn theory is a well-known, long-standing proposal for the resolution of the strong CP problem formulated by Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn in 1977. The theory introduces a new anomalous symmetry to the Standard Model along with a new scalar field which spontaneously breaks the symmetry at low energies, giving rise to an axion that suppresses the problematic CP violation. This model has long since been ruled out by experiments and has instead been replaced by similar invisible axion models which utilize the same mechanism to solve the strong CP problem.

==Overview==

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has a complicated vacuum structure which gives rise to a CP violating θ-term in the . Such a term can have a number of non-perturbative effects, one of which is to give the neutron an electric dipole moment. The absence of this dipole moment in experiments requires the fine-tuning of the θ-term to be very small, something known as the strong CP problem. Motivated as a solution to this problem, Peccei–Quinn (PQ) theory introduces a new complex scalar field formula_1 in addition to the standard Higgs doublet. This scalar field couples to d-type quarks through Yukawa terms, while the Higgs now only couples to the up-type quarks. Additionally, a new global chiral anomalous U(1) symmetry is introduced, the Peccei–Quinn symmetry, under which formula_1 is charged, requiring some of the fermions also have a PQ charge. The scalar field also has a potential

:formula_3

where formula_4 is a dimensionless parameter and formula_5 is known as the decay constant. The potential results in formula_1 having the vacuum expectation value of formula_7 at the electroweak phase transition.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Peccei–Quinn symmetry below the electroweak scale gives rise to a pseudo-Goldstone boson known as the axion formula_8, with the resulting Lagrangian taking the form

:formula_9

where the first term is the Standard Model (SM) and axion Lagrangian which includes axion-fermion interactions arising from the Yukawa terms. The second term is the CP violating θ-term, with formula_10 the strong coupling constant, formula_11 the gluon field strength tensor, and formula_12 the dual field strength tensor. The third term is known as the color anomaly, a consequence of the Peccei–Quinn symmetry being anomalous, with formula_13 determined by the choice of PQ charges for the quarks. If the symmetry is also anomalous in the electromagnetic sector, there will additionally be an anomaly term coupling the axion to photons. Due to the presence of the color anomaly, the effective formula_14 angle is modified to formula_15, giving rise to an effective potential through instanton effects, which can be approximated in the dilute gas approximation as

:formula_16

To minimize the ground state energy, the axion field picks the vacuum expectation value formula_17, with axions now being excitations around this vacuum. This prompts the field redefinition formula_18 which leads to the cancellation of the formula_14 angle, dynamically solving the strong CP problem. It is important to point out that the axion is massive since the Peccei–Quinn symmetry is explicitly broken by the chiral anomaly, with the axion mass roughly given in terms of the pion mass and pion decay constant as formula_20.

==Invisible axion models==

For the Peccei–Quinn model to work, the decay constant must be set at the electroweak scale, leading to a heavy axion. Such an axion has long been ruled out by experiments, for example through bounds on rare kaon decays formula_21. Instead, there are a variety of modified models called invisible axion models which introduce the new scalar field formula_1 independently of the electroweak scale, enabling much larger vacuum expectation values, hence very light axions. 

The most popular such models are the Kim–Shifman–Vainshtein–Zakharov (KSVZ) and the Dine–Fischler–Srednicki–Zhitnisky (DFSZ) models. The KSVZ model introduces a new heavy quark doublet with PQ charge, acquiring its mass through a Yukawa term involving formula_1. Since in this model the only fermions that carry a PQ charge are the heavy quarks, there are no tree-level couplings between the SM fermions and the axion. Meanwhile, the DFSZ model replaces the usual Higgs with two PQ charged Higgs doublets, formula_24 and formula_25, that give mass to the SM fermions through the usual Yukawa terms, while the new scalar only interacts with the standard model through a quartic coupling formula_26. Since the two Higgs doublets carry PQ charge, the resulting axion couples to SM fermions at tree-level.

<doc id="986145" wikidata="Q323602" url="?curid=986145" title="Futabayama Sadaji">
<text>was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Oita Prefecture. Entering sumo in 1927, he was the sport&#x27;s 35th &quot;yokozuna&quot; from 1937 until his retirement in 1945. He won twelve &quot;yūshō&quot; or top division championships and had a winning streak of 69 consecutive bouts, an all-time record. Despite his dominance he was extremely popular with the public. After his retirement he was head coach of Tokitsukaze stable and chairman of the Japan Sumo Association.

==Career==
Born in Usa, he worked on fishing boats as young boy. He joined professional sumo in March 1927 at the age of 15, recruited by Tatsunami stable. He entered the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division at the beginning of 1932. He was promoted from the middle of the second &quot;jūryō&quot; division to &quot;maegashira&quot; 4, as many top division wrestlers had just gone on strike in the Shunjuen Incident, and the Japan Sumo Association needed to fill the gaps in the ranks. However, he soon proved himself worthy of the promotion, finishing as runner-up in his second top division tournament.

Futabayama is particularly remembered for achieving the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts, with 69, a record that still stands today. This represents an unbeaten run which stretched over three years. In a sport where matches often last a few seconds, and a brief lapse in concentration can lead to a loss, this is an exceptional achievement. It began on January 7, 1936 at the rank of &quot;sekiwake&quot;. During this run he was promoted from &quot;maegashira&quot; 3 to &quot;yokozuna&quot;. It generated such excitement among the public that the Sumo Association extended the number of days per tournament from 11 to 13, and then to 15. He was finally defeated on January 3, 1939 by &quot;maegashira&quot; Akinoumi (later a &quot;yokozuna&quot; himself). He lost more to illness than to a superior opponent, as he was suffering from amoebic dysentery at the time.

Futabayama won a total of twelve tournament championships, during a period in which there were only two tournaments held each year. His total remained a record until the number of tournaments was increased to six a year in the 1950s. However, the percentage of championships won in his &quot;makuuchi&quot; career still compares favorably to the wrestlers who have surpassed his total in the six tournament a year era.

After his retirement Futabayama revealed he was actually blind in one eye, due to an injury suffered in his youth, making his achievements even more remarkable.

He was one of the first top wrestlers to break away from the tradition of marrying his stablemaster&#x27;s daughter, instead choosing a young heiress from a rich Kansai family. Their reception was held in April 1939 at the Tokyo Kaikan. (His coach&#x27;s daughter married Haguroyama instead.)

==Fighting style==
Futabayama was noted for being exceptionally good at the initial phase of a sumo match, the &quot;tachi-ai&quot;. He was an expert at the &quot;gonosen no tachiai&quot; or receiving his opponent&#x27;s charge and immediately countering it. He is believed to have never made a false start. Although he was not particularly large, he had excellent balance. One of his most feared techniques was &quot;uwatenage&quot;, or overarm throw.

==Retirement from sumo==

The June 1945 tournament was held in a bomb-damaged Kokugikan with barely any spectators, and Futabayama dropped out after the first day. He did not take part in the November 1945 tournament and announced his retirement during it, claiming that he objected to the newly enlarged &quot;dohyō&quot; that the Sumo Association had introduced with hopes to make the sport more pleasing to the occupying forces. However, he had actually made a decision to retire a year earlier, having suffered a loss to Azumafuji, another future &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

Futabayama had become head of his own stable, Futabayama Dojo, in 1941 whilst still an active wrestler (a practice now forbidden), and upon his retirement he adopted the Tokitsukaze elder name and renamed his &quot;heya&quot; Tokitsukaze stable. It grew to become one of sumo&#x27;s largest stables by the 1950s, and Futabayama produced several strong wrestlers including &quot;yokozuna&quot; Kagamisato and &quot;ōzeki&quot; Kitabayama and Yutakayama. He remained in charge of the stable until his death from hepatitis in 1968. From 1957 he was also chairman (&quot;rijichō&quot;) of the Japan Sumo Association. In his time as chairman he introduced a number of important reforms, such as giving monthly salaries to wrestlers ranked in the top two divisions, and enforcing a mandatory retirement age of 65 for elders and referees.

==Career record==

*&quot;Four tournaments a year, in Tokyo and other locations, were held from 1927–1932. For most of the 1930s and 1940s only two tournaments were held a year in Tokyo only.&quot;
