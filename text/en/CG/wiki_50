<text>Dnipro is Ukraine&#x27;s fourth-largest city, with about one million inhabitants. It is located in the eastern part of Ukraine, southeast of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on the Dnipro River, from which it takes its name. Dnipro is the administrative centre of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. It hosts the administration of Dnipro urban hromada. Dnipro has a population of 

Archeological evidence suggests the site of the present city was settled by Cossack communities from at least 1524. Yekaterinoslav (&quot;glory of Catherine&quot;) was established by decree of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1787 as the administrative center of Novorossiya. From the end of the 19th century, the town attracted foreign capital and an international, multi-ethnic workforce exploiting Kryvbas iron ore and Donbas coal.

Renamed Dnipropetrovsk in 1926 after the Ukrainian Communist Party leader Grigory Petrovsky, it became a focus for the Stalinist commitment to the rapid development of heavy industry. After World War II, this included nuclear, arms, and space industries whose strategic importance led to Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s designation as a closed city.

Following the Euromaidan events of 2014, the city politically shifted away from pro-Russian parties and figures towards those favoring closer ties with the European Union. As a result of decommunization, the city was renamed Dnipro in 2016. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Dnipro rapidly developed as a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the various battle fronts.

===Name history===
The original name of a Ukrainian Cossack city on the territory of modern Dnipro was Novyi Kodak ( , New Kodak). Also on the territory of Modern Dnipro, the Russian Empire founded Yekaterinoslav (&quot;the glory of Catherine&quot;). This name was first mentioned in a report to Azov Governor Vasily Chertkov to Grigory Potemkin on 23 April 1776. He wrote &quot;The provincial city called Yekaterinoslav should be the best convenience on the right side of the Dnieper River near Kaydak...&quot; (Which referred to ). The construction was officially transferred to the right bank in a decree of Empress of Russia Catherine II of 23 January 1784.

In the 17th century the city was also known as Polovytsia.

In 1918, the Central Council of Ukraine of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic proposed to change the name of the city to &quot;Sicheslav&quot;; however, this was never finalised.

In 1926 the city was renamed after communist leader Grigory Petrovsky. In some Anglophone media Dnipro was nicknamed the Rocket City during the Cold War.

The 2015 law on decommunization required the city to be renamed. On 29 December 2015 the city council officially changed the reference of the city naming from referring to Petrovsky to being in honor of Saint Peter, thus making the name consistent with the law without actually changing the name itself.

On 3 February 2016 a draft law was registered in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) to change the name of the city to &quot;Dnipro&quot;. On 19 May 2016 the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill to officially rename the city (to &quot;Dnipro&quot;). The resolution was approved by 247 out of the 344 MPs, with 16 opposing the measure.

Following the renaming of the city the reference to Petrovsky has been removed from institutions named after the city. A notable exception is the name of the surrounding province, which is listed in the territorial structure of Ukraine in the Constitution. Thus until a lengthy and complicated process of amending is carried out, it officially retains the name Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

==History==
===Early history===

Human settlements in current Dnipropetrovsk Oblast date from the Paleolithic era. According to archeological finds, in the Paleolithic period (7—3 thousand &quot;Anno Domini&quot;) human settlements appear near the in what is now Chechelivskyi District and on Monastyrskyi Island. A Neolithic stonecrafter&#x27;s house has been excavated in one of Dnipro&#x27;s city parks. In the Bronze Age the area was settled by diverse tribes. Traces of Cimmerian settlements during the Bronze Age have been found near today&#x27;s Taras Shevchenko Park. The area of modern Dnipro was part of the Scythian empire from approximately the 1st century BC until the 3rd century BC. During the Migration Period (300–800) nomadic tribes of the Huns, Avars, Bulgarians, and Magyars passed through the lands of the Dnieper region, they came into contact with local agricultural East Slavs.

The area of modern Dnipro was part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; (882–1240). The region witnessed fighting between the armies of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Khazars, Pechenegs, Tork people and Cumans. In the 13th century the Dnieper region was devastated during the Mongol Empire conquest of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The area of modern Dnipro city was incorporated into the Mongol&#x27;s khanate Golden Horde.

In the 15th century the area became part of the Kiev Voivodeship (1471–1565) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Archeological finds in today&#x27;s Dnipro&#x27;s urban district Samarskyi District suggest that the important river crossing was a trading settlement from at least 1524. In 1635, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth built the Kodak Fortress above the Dnieper Rapids at &quot;Kodaky&quot; on the south-eastern outskirts of modern Dnipro near the current Kaidatsky Bridge, only to have it destroyed within months by the Cossacks of Ivan Sulyma. Rebuilt in 1645, it was captured by Zaporozhian Sich in 1648.

Around the fortress a settlement emerged that became a town in (province) of the Zaporizhian Sich called . Cossacks often hid the true number of the population to reduce taxation and other obligations, but according to documentary evidence, it can be assumed that the population of New Kodak was at least 3,000 people. The fortress was garrisoned by Cossacks until the Sich, allied with the Ottoman Empire and their Tartar vassals, drove out the encroaching Tsardom of Russia. Under the terms of the Russian withdrawal—the Treaty of the Pruth in 1711—the Kodak fortress was demolished.

In the mid-1730s, the fortress and Russians returned, living in an uneasy cohabitation with local cossacks. From mid-century they co-existed with the Zaporozhian sloboda (or &quot;free settlement&quot;) of &quot;Polovytsia&quot; located on the site of today&#x27;s Central Terminal and the &quot;Ozyorka&quot; farmers market.

In the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), the Zaporozhian cossacks allied with Empress Catherine II. No sooner had they assisted the Russians to victory than they faced an imperial ultimatum to disband their confederation. The liquidation of the Sich destroyed their political autonomy and saw the incorporation of their lands into the new governates of Novorossiya. In 1784, Catherine ordered the foundation of new city, commonly referred to at the time as Katerynoslav.

In 2001 the seal of Kodak Palanka became the central element of and .

=== Imperial city ===
==== Establishment of Catherine&#x27;s city ====
The first written mention of a town in the Russian Empire called Yekaterinoslav can be found in a report from Azov Governor Vasily Chertkov to Grigory Potemkin on 23 April 1776. He wrote &quot;The provincial city called Yekaterinoslav should be the best convenience on the right side of the Dnieper River near Kaydak...&quot; (Which referred to ). In 1777, a town named Yekaterinoslav (&quot;the glory of Catherine&quot;), was built to the north of the present-day city at the confluence of the Samara and Kilchen rivers. The site was badly chosen – spring waters transformed the city into a bog. The surviving settlement was later renamed Novomoskovsk.

The territory of modern Dnipro, despite the modern-day city&#x27;s size, still has not expanded to encompass the territory of (Chertkov&#x27;s) Yekaterinoslav of 1776. On 22 January 1784 Russian Empress Catherine the Great signed an Imperial Ukase directing that &quot;the gubernatorial city under name of Yekaterinoslav be moved to the right bank of the Dnieper river near Kodak&quot;. The new city would serve Grigory Potemkin as a Viceregal seat for the combined Novorossiya and Azov Governorates.

On , in the course of her celebrated Crimean journey, the Empress laid the foundation stone of the Transfiguration Cathedral in the presence of Austrian Emperor Joseph II, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, and the French and English ambassadors. Potemkin&#x27;s grandiose plans for a third Russian imperial capital alongside Moscow and Saint Petersburg included a viceregal palace, a university (Potemkin envisioned Yekaterinoslav as the &#x27;Athens of southern Russia&#x27;), courts of law and a botanical garden, were frustrated by a renewal of the Russo-Turkish war in 1787, by bureaucratic procrastination, defective workmanship, and theft, Potemkin&#x27;s death in 1791 and that of his imperial patroness five years later.

In 1815 a government official described the town as &quot;more like some Dutch [Mennonite] colony then a provincial administrative centre&quot;. The cathedral, much reduced in size, was completed in 1835.

===== Disputed year of foundation =====
Scholarship concerning the foundation of the city has been subject to political considerations and dispute. In 1976, to have the bicentenary of the city coincide with the 70th anniversary of the birth of Soviet party leader, and regional native son, Leonid Brezhnev, the date of the city&#x27;s foundation was moved back from the visit Russian Empress Catherine II in 1787, to 1776.

Following Ukrainian independence, local historians began to promote the idea of a town emerging in the 17th century from Cossack settlements, an approach aimed at promoting the city&#x27;s Ukrainian identity. They cited the chronicler of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Dmytro Yavornytsky, whose &quot;History of the City of Ekaterinoslav&quot; completed in 1940 was authorised for publication only in 1989, the era of Glasnost.

==== Growth as an industrial centre ====

While into the late nineteenth century the principal business of the town remained the processing of agricultural raw materials, there was an early state-sponsored effort to promote manufacture. In 1794 the government supported two factories: a textile factory that was transferred from the town of Dubrovny Mogilev Governorate and a silk-stockings factory that was brought from the village of Kupavna near Moscow. In 1797 the textile factory employed 819 permanent workers, 378 of whom were women and 115 children. The silk stocking workers, the majority being women, were serfs bought at an auction for 16,000 roubles. Conditions, as Potemkin himself was forced to admit, were harsh, with many of the workers dying from malnutrition and exhaustion.

From 1797 to 1802, while serving under the Emperor Paul I as the administrative centre of a centre of the Novorossiya Governorate, the settlement was officially known as &quot;Novorossiysk.&quot;

Despite the bridging of the Dnieper in 1796, commerce was slow to develop. 1832 saw the establishment of the small Zaslavsky iron-casting factory, the town&#x27;s first metallurgical enterprise. Industrialisation gathered apace in the 1880s with the establishment of the first railway connections. Rail construction responded to the enterprise of two men: John Hughes, a Welsh businessman who built an iron works at Yuzovka in 1869–72, and developed the Donbas coal deposits; and the Russian geologist Alexander Pol, who in 1866 had discovered the Krivoy Rog iron ore basin, Krivbass, during archaeological research.

In 1884, a railway to supply pig iron foundries in Krivoy Rog with Donbass coal crossed the Dnieper at Yekaterinoslav. It proved a spur to further industrial development and to the creation of the new suburbs of Amur and Nyzhniodniprovsk.

In 1897, Yekaterinoslav became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams. The &quot;Yekaterinoslav Higher Mining School&quot;, today&#x27;s Dnipro Polytechnic, was founded in 1899. Within twenty years the population had more than tripled, reaching 157,000 in 1904. The immigrants flowing into the city were mainly ethnic or cultural Russians and Jews, with the Ukrainian population remaining rural in this stage of the Industrial Revolution.

==== The Jewish community and the 1905 pogrom ====

From 1792 Yekaterinoslav was within the Pale of Settlement, the former Polish-Lithuanian territories in which Catherine and her successors enforced no limitation on the movement and residency of their Jewish subjects. Within less than a century, a largely Yiddish-speaking Jewish community of 40,000 constituted more than a third of the city&#x27;s population, and contributed a considerable share of its business capital and industrial workforce.

Such apparent strength did not protect the community—members of whom had had the unpopular task of collecting government taxes and recruiting young men for the army— from communal violence. In 1883, three days of rioting destroyed Jewish business, and persuaded many to temporarily leave the city. There was a return of anti–Semitic incitement among the Christian public in 1904, but attacks on community were, at that time, suppressed on the order of a liberal governor.

In the widespread social unrest that followed the 1905 defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, the political life of the city was dominated by the revolutionary opposition (including the Jewish Workers Socialist Party and the Bund) and by the insurrectionary spirit of the nascent labor movement. The local czarist authorities were able to ride out the wave political protests and strikes, in part by playing on division between Jewish workers who predominated as clerks and artisans in the city, and Russian workers employed in the large suburban factories. There was a wave of anti-Semitic attacks. With the army intervening against Jewish defense groups, about 100 Jews were killed and two hundred wounded.

According to local historian Andrii Portnov, 40% of the local Yekaterinoslav population was Jewish in the years leading up to World War I.

===The Soviet era===
==== War and revolution ====
Directly following the Russian February Revolution, in the night of 3 March O.S (16 March N.S) to 4 March 1917 a provisional government was organised in Yekaterinoslav headed by the (since 1913) chairman of the provincial land administration . Also on 4 March a Council of Workers&#x27; Deputies was formed. On 6 March the prime minister of the Russian Provisional Government Georgy Lvov removed the governor and the vice-governor of Yekaterinoslav Governorate, temporarily handing these powers to Hesberg. On 9 March a Yekaterinoslav Council of Workers and Soldiers deputies was formed.

On 16 May the Council of Workers&#x27; Deputies and the Council of Workers and Soldiers merged, to become named the Revolutionary Council in November 1917. All these power structures existed in duality, with Hesberg&#x27;s provisional government often being at a disadvantage. In 1917 the city saw numerous meetings, rallies, meetings, conferences, congresses and demonstrations by political parties all over the political spectrum. Due to intense political agitation the newly formed factory committees and professional unions by autumn of 1917 mainly supported the Bolsheviks, significantly strengthening their positions.

In June 1917 a Central Council (Tsentralna Rada) of Ukrainian parties in Kyiv declared Yekaterinoslav to be within the territory of the autonomous Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR). On 13 August 1917 the first democratic Yekaterinoslav 120 seats city Duma election took place. The Bolsheviks gained 24 seats and the Mensheviks 16, with pro-Ukrainian parties picking up 6 seats. was elected Mayor of the city. Osipov was Mayor until the dissolution of the city Duma in May 1918. On 10 November 1917 a parade of Ukrainian troops was held, organized by the Yekaterinoslav Ukrainian Military Council in support of the Third Universal of the Ukrainian Central Council, the proclamation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

In the November 1917 elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly, the Bolsheviks secured just under 18 per cent of the vote in the Governorate, compared to 46 per cent for the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries and their allies. On 22 November 1917 the Revolutionary Council and the city Duma pledged their allegiance to the Tsentralna Rada. The Bolsheviks then left these organisations. During December, the situation in the city worsened with both sides preparing for military action.

On 26 December, the Bolsheviks defied an ultimatum from the Tsentralna Rada and after three days of fighting consolidated their control of the city. On 12 February they declared Yekaterinoslav part of a Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, but the following month, under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, conceded the territory to the German and Austrian-allied UPR. On 5 April 1918 the Imperial German army entered the city. Five hundred remaining Bolshevik Red Guards were publicly executed.

The formal tenure of the UPR was brief: on 29 April 1918 intervention by the Central Powers saw the UPR replaced by the more pliant Ukrainian State or Hetmanate. On 18 May 1918 the Hetman of the Ukrainian State, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, ordered the previously nationalized enterprises returned to their former owners, and with the assistance of Austro-Hungarian troops the new authorities suppressed labor protest.

On 23 December 1918, following their defeat by the Western Allies and after four days of insurgency within the city, German and Austro-Hungarian occupation forces withdrew. Four days later, Yekaterinoslav was stormed by the anarchist Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine (the &quot;Makhnovshchina&quot;), putting to flight forces loyal to the UPR&#x27;s new Directorate. Over the course of the following year, city was to change hands several more times, contested between the UPR, the Whites (Armed Forces of South Russia), Nykyfor Hryhoriv&#x27;s peasant insurgents, &quot;Makhnovshchina&quot; (who returned twice), and the Bolsheviks, who reorganised as the Red Army, finally secured the city on 30 December 1919.

The city had been extensively damaged and the population, which had stood at about 268,000 people in 1917, had dropped to under 190,000.

==== Stalin-era industrialisation ====

In late May 1920 the food supply to Yekaterinoslav deteriorated, resulting in a wave of strikes. In June 1920 Soviet authorities quelled one such protest by arresting 200 railway workers, of which 51 were sentenced to immediate execution.

In 1922 the region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. In 1922 the Soviet government ordered that &quot;all nationalized enterprises with names related to the Company or the Surname of the old owners must be renamed in memory of revolutionary events, in memory of the international, all-Russian or local leaders of the proletarian revolution.&quot; In 1922 and 1923 the factories were renamed, as well as dozens of streets, alleys, driveways, squares and parks. In 1923 the city council adopted a resolution to organize a competition to rename the city itself.

In 1924 a Provincial Congress of Soviets adopted a resolution on renaming the city of Yekaterinoslav to the city of Krasnodniprovsk (and Yekaterinoslav Governorate to Krasnodniprovsk). Following this, many organizations and institutions began to name Yekaterinoslav Krasnodniprovsk in official documents, only to be reminded in the press that the renaming of settlements could only be decided by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. In 1926 a provisional District Congress of Workers&#x27;, Peasants&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies adopted a resolution on renaming Yekaterinoslav to the name Dnipropetrovsk in honour of the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets&#x27;s chairman of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee, Grigory Petrovsky.

Petrovsky was present at this congress and he did &quot;accept this honour with great gratitude.&quot; The resolution of the congress was approved by a resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet dated 20 July 1926. In the 1920s and 1930s dozens of streets, alleys, driveways, squares and parks continued to be renamed in the city, this continued in the 1940s and in subsequent years.

By 1927 the industry of Dnipropetrovsk was completely rebuilt, and according to some indicators exceeded pre-war levels. Due to agrarian overpopulation, an influx of unemployed from other settlements, a higher birth rates among other reasons, both employment and unemployment in Dnipropetrovsk rose. In the late twenties, the authorities had to contend with growing labour unrest. &quot;Do not strangle us, our children are dying of hunger, we have been placed in worse conditions than under the old regime&quot; read one protest.

The city figured prominently in Stalin&#x27;s Five-Year Plans for industrialisation. In 1932, Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s regional metallurgical plants produced 20 per cent of the entire cast iron and 25 per cent of the steel manufactured in the Ukrainian SSR. By the end of the thirties the Dnipropetrovsk region became the most urbanised of Soviet Ukraine with more than 2,273,000 people living in the region and over half a million in the city proper. Dnipropetrovsk became an important cultural and educational centre with ten colleges and a State University.

The surrounding countryside was devastated by the policy of forced collectivisation and grain seizures. Peasants had died en masse during the Holodomor of 1932–33. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in the years 1932–33 lost 3.5 to 9.8 million people, making it one of the most affected areas of the famine.

Drawn by employment in the expanding heavy industry, the survivors changed the ethnic composition of the city. The percentage of residents recorded as Ukrainian rose from 36 per cent of the population in 1926 to 54.6 per cent in 1939. The Russian percentage fell from 31.6 to 23.4, and the Jewish share fell from 26.8 to 17.9. The city&#x27;s population during the Interwar period grew rapidly. 368,000 people lived in Dnipropetrovsk in 1932. In the 1939 Soviet Census, this number had grown to more than half a million (500,662 people).

Soviet Ukrainization and Korenizatsiya were implemented in Dnipropetrovsk. The Communist party of Ukraine organized special courses in Ukrainian studies. Soviet authorities greatly increased the number of schools, and by the mid-1930s had eradicate illiteracy in the city. New universities were opened. At the end of the 1930s Dnipropetrovsk had 10 higher and 19 special educational institutions. In the 1930s a significant number of new secondary schools and hospitals were built in the city, and city parks were improved.

The Great Purge, following the Assassination of Sergei Kirov, also reached Dnipropetrovsk. In 1935 the Dnipropetrovsk NKVD arrested 182 &quot;Trotskyists&quot;. In 1935, 235 alleged &quot;internal enemies&quot; were executed, including a few university rectors. In 1936, 526 people were executed. In 1937, the regional administration of the NKVD killed 16,421 people.

==== Nazi occupation ====

Dnipropetrovsk was under Nazi German occupation from 26 August 1941 to 25 October 1943. The city was administered as part of the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine.&quot; The Holocaust in Dnipropetrovsk reduced the city&#x27;s remaining Jewish population, estimates for which range from 55,000 to 30,000, to just 702. In just two days, 13–14 October 1941, the Germans killed 15,000.

Germany operated three prisoner-of-war camps in the city, chiefly Stalag 348 with several subcamps in the region from October 1941 to February 1943, after its relocation from Rzeszów in German-occupied Poland, at which the occupiers are estimated to have killed upwards of 30,000 Soviet POWs, and briefly also the Stalag 310 and Stalag 387 camps.

In November 1941 Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s population was 233,000. In March 1942 this number had fallen to 178,000. On 25 October 1943 the population on the right-bank of the city numbered no more than 5,000. According to official statistics, in 1945 the population of Dnipropetrovsk had increased to 259,000 people.

==== Post-war closed city ====

As early as July 1944, the State Committee of Defence in Moscow decided to build a large military machine-building factory in Dnipropetrovsk on the location of the pre-war aircraft plant. In December 1945, thousands of German prisoners of war began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory. This was the foundation of the Dnipropetrovsk Automobile Factory. In 1954 the administration of this automobile factory opened a secret design office, designated OKB-586, to construct military missiles and rocket engines.

The high-security project was joined by hundreds of physicists, engineers and machine designers from Moscow and other large Soviet cities. In 1965, the secret Plant No. 586 was transferred to the USSR Ministry of General Machine-Building which renamed it &quot;the Southern Machine-building Factory&quot; (Yuzhnyi mashino-stroitel&#x27;nyi zavod) or in abbreviated Russian, simply Yuzhmash. Yuzhmash became a significant factor in the arms race of the Cold War (Nikita Khrushchev boasted in 1960 that it was producing rockets &quot;like sausages&quot; ).

In 1959, Dnipropetrovsk was officially closed to foreign visitors. No foreign citizen, even of a socialist state, was allowed to visit the city or district. Its citizens were held by Communist authorities to a higher standard of ideological purity than the rest of the population, and their freedom of movement was severely restricted. It was not until 1987, during perestroika, that Dnipropetrovsk was opened to international visitors and civil restrictions were lifted.

The population of Dnipropetrovsk increased from 259,000 people in 1945 to 845,200 in 1965.

Notwithstanding the high-security regime, in September and October 1972, workers downed tools in several factories in Dnipropetrovsk demanding higher wages, better food and living conditions, and the right to choose one&#x27;s job. Labour militancy returned in the late 1980s, a period in which promises of Perestrioka and Glasnost raised popular expectations. In 1990 two thousand inmates rioted in the women&#x27;s remand prison in a further of sign of growing unrest.

==== Dissent and youth rebellion ====

In 1959 17.4% of Dnipropetrovsk students were taught in Ukrainian language schools and 82.6% in Russian language schools. 58% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants self-identified as Ukrainians. Compared with the other 3 biggest cities of Ukraine Dnipropetrovsk had a rather large share of education conducted in Ukrainian. In Kyiv 26.8% of pupils studied in Ukrainian and 73.1% in Russian while 66% of Kyiv residents considered themselves Ukrainian, in Kharkiv these numbers were 4.9%, 95.1% and 49%. In Odesa these numbers were 8.1%, 91.9% and 40%.

As in the overall Ukrainian SSR, Dnipropetrovsk saw an influx of young immigrants from rural Ukraine. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast saw the highest inflow of rural youth of all Ukraine.

According to KGB reports, in the 1960s &quot;Samizdat&quot; and Ukrainian diaspora publications began to circulate via Western Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk. These fed into underground student circles where they promoted interest in the &quot;Ukrainian Sixtiers&quot;, in Ukrainian history, especially of Ukrainian Cossacks, and in the revival of the Ukrainian language. Occasionally the blue and yellow flag of independent Ukraine was unfurled in protest. The authorities responded with repression: arresting and jailing members of underground discussion groups for &quot;nationalistic propaganda&quot;.

The growing evidence of dissent in the city coincided from the late 1960s with what the KGB referred to as &quot;radio hooliganism&quot;. Thousands of high-school and college students had become ham radio enthusiasts, recording and rebroadcasting western popular music. Annual KGB reports regularly drew a connection between enthusiasm for western pop culture and anti-Soviet behaviour. In the 1980s, by which time the KGB had conceded that their raids against &quot;hippies&quot; had failed suppress the youth rebellion, such behaviour was reportedly found in an admixture of Anglo-American&quot; heavy metal, punk rock and Banderism—the veneration of Stepan Bandera, and of other Ukrainian nationalists, who in the Soviet narrative were denounced and discredited as Nazi collaborators.

In an attempt to provide Dnipropetrovsk youth with an ideologically safe alternative, beginning in 1976 the local Komsomol set up approved discotheques. Some of the activists involved in this &quot;disco movement&quot; went on in the 1980s to engage in their own illicit tourist and music enterprises, and several later became influential figures in Ukrainian national politics, among them Yulia Tymoshenko, Victor Pinchuk, Serhiy Tihipko, Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Oleksandr Turchynov.

==== The &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Mafia&quot; ====
Reflecting Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s special strategic importance for the entire Soviet Union, party cadres from the &quot;rocket city&quot; played an outsized role not only in republican leadership in Kyiv, but also in the Union leadership in Moscow. During Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, Leonid Brezhnev rose rapidly within the ranks of the local &quot;nomenklatura,&quot; from director of the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute in 1936 to regional (Obkom) Party Secretary in charge of the city&#x27;s defence industries in 1939.

Here, he took the first steps toward building a network of supporters which came to be known as the &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Mafia&quot;. They spearheaded the internal party coup that in 1964 saw Brezhnev replace Nikita Khrushchev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and call a halt to further reform.

===Independent Ukraine===
In a national referendum on 1 December 1991, 90.36% of Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s voters approved the declaration of independence that had been made by the Ukrainian parliament on 24 August. Amidst the economic dislocation and soaring inflation that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet Union, output declined. Although its economic contraction was at a rate below the national average, the Dnipropetrovsk city and oblast witnessed one of the largest population declines of all the regions of Ukraine. By 2021, the city&#x27;s population, which had stood at over 1.2 million in 1991, had been reduced to 981,000. Young people from Dnipropetrovsk were among the millions of Ukrainians who left the country to find work and opportunity abroad.

The continuation into the new century of the chaotic fallout from the collapse of the Soviet Union was symbolized for many in Dnipropetrovsk by two violent episodes. In June and July 2007, Dnipropetrovsk experienced a wave of random video-recorded serial killings that were dubbed by the media as the work of the &quot;Dnipropetrovsk maniacs&quot;. In February 2009, three youths were sentenced for their part in 21 murders, and numerous other attacks and robberies. On 27 April 2012, four bombs exploded near four tram stations in Dnipropetrovsk, injuring 27 people. No one was convicted. Opposition politicians claimed to see the hand of President Viktor Yanukovych intent on disrupting the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election and installing a presidential regime.

==== Euromaidan ====

On 26 January 2014, 3,000 anti-Viktor Yanukovych (Ukrainian President) and pro-Euromaidan activists attempted but failed to capture the Regional State Administration building. There were street disturbances and Euromaidan protesters were reported to be beaten up by paid pro-Yanukovych supporters (the so-called &quot;Titushky&quot;). Dnipropetrovsk Governor Kolesnikov called them &quot;extreme radical thugs from other regions&quot;.

Two days later about 2,000 public sector employees called an indefinite rally in support of the Yanukovych government. Meanwhile, the government building was reinforced with barbed wire. On 19 February 2014 there was an anti-Yanukovych picket near the Regional State Administration. On 22 February 2014, after a further anti-Yanukovych demonstration, Dnipropetrovsk Mayor Ivan Kulichenko, for the sake of &quot;peace in the city&quot; left Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions.

Simultaneously the Dnipropetrovsk City Council vowed to support &quot;the preservation of Ukraine as a single and indivisible state&quot;, although some members had called for separatism and for federalization of Ukraine. On the same day, after street fighting in Kyiv, 22 February 2014, Yanukovych left Ukraine and went into Russian exile.

==== 2014 to 2022 ====
Dnipropetrovsk remained relatively quiet during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, with pro-Russian Federation protestors outnumbered by those opposing outside intervention. In March 2014 the city&#x27;s Lenin Square was renamed &quot;Heroes of Independence Square&quot; in honor of the people killed during Euromaidan. The statue of Lenin on the square was removed. In June 2014 another Lenin monument was removed and replaced by a monument to the Ukrainian military fighting the Russo-Ukrainian War.
To comply with the 2015 decommunization law the city was renamed &quot;Dnipro&quot; in May 2016, after the river that flows through the city. By summer 2016 not only was the city renamed, but so were more than 350 streets, alleys, driveways, squares and parks. For example, Karl Marx Avenue, the main street, was renamed Yavornytskyi Avenue in honour of the once neglected city and cossack historian. This was 12 per cent of all of the city&#x27;s toponymies. Five of the eight urban districts of the city received new names.

==== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and with developing military fronts near Kyiv and to the north, east and south, Dnipro has become a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the war. Roughly equidistant from the war&#x27;s major theatres in the east and the south, the city&#x27;s location is proving critical for supplying the Ukrainian defence effort. At the same time, its control of a Dnieper River crossing and the opportunity it would provide to cut off Ukrainian forces in the Donbas makes the city a high-value target for the Russians.

Dnipro is reported as the only city in Ukraine where a volunteer formation has been created under direct City Council control. It is called the &quot;Dnieper Guard&quot; (Варти Дніпра, Varty Dnipra). The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov has dismissed suggestions that the group remained Ihor Kolomoyskyi&#x27;s &quot;private army&quot;. Kolomoyskyi has helped with some equipment purchases, but the force performs defence and law and order functions under the leadership of the national police.
The Russians first hit Dnipro on 11 March. Three air strikes close to a kindergarten and an apartment building killed at least one person. On 15 March, Russian missiles hit Dnipro International Airport, destroying the runway and damaging the terminal. In the early hours of 6 April, an air strike destroyed an oil depot. On 10 April, a Ukrainian government spokesperson said that the airport in Dnipro had been &quot;completely destroyed&quot; as the result of a Russian attack. On 15 July, a Russian missile attack killed four people and injured sixteen others in Dnipro.

As part of the derussification campaign that swept through Ukraine following the February 2022 invasion 110 toponyms in the city were &quot;de-Russified&quot; from February to September 2022. The renaming started on 21 April when 31 streets connected to Russia were renamed. In May another 20 streets were renamed, followed by 21 more streets and alleys in June 2022. According to Dnipro&#x27;s Mayor Borys Filatov (speaking on 21 September 2022) &quot;this is not the end.&quot; Among other renamings, the Schmidt Street (the street was originally the Gymnasium Street but it was renamed to Otto Schmidt Street by Soviet authorities in 1934) in the center of Dnipro was renamed to Stepan Bandera Street. In May 2022 (also) several outdoor objects related to the USSR were dismantled in Dnipro. In December 2022 Dnipro removed from the city all monuments to figures of Russian culture and history. On 22 February 2023 26 more streets were renamed.

Dnipro was hit during the autumn 2022 Russian missile strikes on critical infrastructure. On 10 October three civilians were killed. On 18 October 2022 Russian missile strikes targeted the energy infrastructure of Dnipro. On 17 November 2022 23 people were injured. The attacks continued in 2023. The most deadly of these attacks being the 14 January 2023 missile strike on an apartment building that killed 40 people, injured 75 and with 46 people reported missing.

== Government and politics ==
=== Government ===

The City of Dnipro is governed by the Dnipro City Council. It is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.

Administratively, the city is divided into urban districts. Presently, there are 8 of them. Aviatorske, a rural settlement located near the Dnipro International Airport, is also a part of Dnipro urban hromada.

The City Council Assembly makes up the administration&#x27;s legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city &#x27;parliament&#x27; or rada. The municipal council is made up of 12 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The council has 29 standing commissions which play an important role in the oversight of the city and its merchants.

Until 18 July 2020, Dnipro was incorporated as a city of oblast significance, the centre of Dnipro Municipality and extraterritorial administrative centre of Dnipro Raion. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven. The area of Dnipro Municipality was merged into Dnipro Raion.

Dnipro is also the seat of the oblast&#x27;s local administration controlled by the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada. The Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is appointed by the President of Ukraine.

====Subdivisions====




Five of the eight urban districts were renamed late November 2015 to comply with decommunization laws.

=== Politics ===
In the first decades of Ukrainian independence the city&#x27;s voters generally favoured the proponents of continued close ties to Russia: in the 1990s the Communist Party of Ukraine, and in the new century, the Party of Regions. After the 2014 events of Euromaidan, which included demonstrations and clashes in the central city, the Party of Regions ceded influence to those parties and independents calling for closer ties to the European Union.

As in Soviet Ukraine, Dnipropetrovsk was disproportionately represented among political leaders in Kyiv. The principal representatives of the so-called &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Faction&quot; in the capital were Ukraine&#x27;s second president Leonid Kuchma and Ukraine&#x27;s 10th and 13th prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Kuchma was a former senior manager of Yuzhmash while Tymoshenko was president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a Dnipropetrovsk-based private company that from 1995 to 1997 was the main importer of Russian natural gas to Ukraine.

Kuchma&#x27;s 1994 presidential campaign had been financed by Dnipropetrovsk businessmen Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Gennadiy Bogolyubov. Kolomoyskyi and Bogolyubov were partners in Privat Group, a scandal-ridden financial-industrial conglomerate. As prime Minister, Kuchma had granted their &quot;PrivatBank&quot; the unique privilege of opening overseas branches. These were later implicated in the wholesale defrauding of Ukrainian depositors, leading to the bank&#x27;s nationalization in 2016. Kuchma was also closely tied to another budding Dnipropetrovsk billionaire, his son-in-law Viktor Pinchuk whose assets included several giant steel and pipe plants in the region and the bank &quot;Kredit-Dnepr&quot;.

With Viktor Yushchenko, Tymoshenko co-led the Orange Revolution which annulled the declared victory of Viktor Yanukovych in the 2004 presidential election, and under President Yuschenko served as prime minister from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 4 March 2010. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, taking 41.7 per cent of the vote in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The candidates accused one another of vote rigging.

In the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions, which promoted itself as the champion of the language rights and industrial interests of largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, won 35.8 per cent of the vote in the Dnipropetrovsk region, compared to 18.4 per cent for Tymoshenko&#x27;s Fatherland Party and 19.4 per cent for the Communists. Tymoshenko mounted a hunger strike to once again protest election irregularities.

On 2 March 2014, following the removal of Yanukovich as President, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov appointed Ihor Kolomoyskyi Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Kolomoyskyi initially dismissed suggestions of Russian-backed separatism in Dnipropetrovsk, but then took vigorous measures. He posted bounties for the capture of Russian-backed militants and the surrender of weapons; drafted thousands of Privat Group employees as auxiliary police officers; and is said to have provided substantial funds to create the Dnipro Battalion, and to support the Aidar, Azov, and Donbas volunteer battalions.

In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Petro Poroshenko won the May 2014 presidential election with 45 per cent, but in the 2014 parliamentary election in October his political party Petro Poroshenko Bloc secured 19.4 per cent of the vote, 5 points behind the Opposition Bloc, the successor to the disbanded Party of Regions.

On 25 March 2015, following a struggle with Kolomoyskyi for control the state-owned oil pipeline operator, President Poroshenko replaced Kolomoyskyi as governor with Valentyn Reznichenko.

In the 2015 Ukrainian local elections Borys Filatov of the patriotic UKROP was elected Mayor of Dnipro.

In the March–April 2019 Ukrainian presidential election Dnipro voted overwhelmingly voted for the successful candidate, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who advocated membership of European Union. In the parliamentary election in October, his Servant of the People party swept the board, winning each of Dnipro&#x27;s five single-mandate parliamentary constituencies.

By the time of the October 2020 Ukrainian local elections, support for Zelenskyy&#x27;s party had collapsed: it won just 8.7 per cent of the vote for the city council. The Euromaidan trajectory was represented instead by Filatov&#x27;s Proposition (the &quot;Party of Mayors&quot;), with 60 per cent of the popular vote against 30 per cent for the pro-Russian the Opposition Platform – For Life.

==Geography==
The city is built mainly upon both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the Samara River. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing Kherson, where it finally flows into the Black Sea.

Nowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about south-east of the city.

The centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the Dnieper Upland, while the left bank is part of the Dnieper Lowland. The old town is situated atop a hill that is formed as a result of the river&#x27;s change of course to the south. The change of river&#x27;s direction is caused by its proximity to the Azov Upland located southeast of the city.

One of the city&#x27;s streets, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area&#x27;s most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system, Dnipro has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;). Snowfall is more common in the hills than at the city&#x27;s lower elevations. The city has four distinct seasons: a cold, snowy winter; a hot summer; and two relatively wet transition periods. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and belongs to the Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high evapotranspiration.

During the summer, Dnipro is very warm (average day temperature in July is , even hot sometimes ). Temperatures as high as have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is , but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.

The best time for visiting the city is in late spring (late April and May), and early in autumn: September, October, when the city&#x27;s trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.

&quot;However, the city is characterized with significant pollution of air with industrial emissions.&quot; The &quot;severely polluted air and water&quot; and allegedly &quot;vast areas of decimated landscape&quot; of Dnipro and Donetsk are considered by some to be an environmental crisis. Though exactly where in Dnipropetrovsk these areas might be found is not stated.

===Cityscape===

Dnipro is a primarily industrial city of around one million people. It has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine&#x27;s fourth-largest city after Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Stalinist architecture (monumental soviet classicism) dominates in the city centre.

Immediately after its foundation Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the Dnieper River. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the Transfiguration Cathedral, completed in 1835. Neoclassical structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Many of these buildings have been retained in the city&#x27;s older Sobornyi District. Among the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, including the Khrennikov House.

Over the next few decades, until the final end of the Russian Empire with the October Revolution in 1917, the city did not change much in appearance. The predominant architectural style remained neo-classicism. Notable buildings built in the era before 1917 include the main building of the Dnipro Polytechnic, which was built in 1899–1901, the art-nouveau inspired building of the city&#x27;s former Duma (parliament), the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the Mechnikov Regional Hospital. Other buildings of the era that did not fit the typical architectural style of the time in Dnipropetrovsk include, the Ukrainian-influenced Grand Hotel Ukraine, the Russian revivalist style railway station (since reconstructed), and the art-nouveau Astoriya building on Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt.

Once Yekaterinoslav became part of the Soviet Union (officially in 1922), and became Dnipropetrovsk in 1926, the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments. Monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism. Following the 1917 October Revolution, a monument to Catherine the Great that stood in front of the Mining Institute was replaced with one of Russian academic Mikhail Lomonosov.

Later, due to damage from World War II, badly damaged buildings were, more often than not, demolished completely and replaced with new structures. In the early 1950s, during the ongoing industrialisation of the city, much of Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s centre was rebuilt in the Stalinist style of Socialist Realism. This is one of the main reasons why much of Dnipro&#x27;s central avenue, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt (formerly Karl Marx Prospect), is designed in the style of Stalinist Social Realism. A number of large buildings were reconstructed. The main railway station, for example, was stripped of its Russian-revival ornamentation and redesigned in the style of Stalinist social-realism.
The Grand Hotel Ukraine survived the war but was later simplified much in design, with its roof being reconstructed in a typical French mansard style as opposed to the ornamental Ukrainian Baroque of the pre-war era. Many pre-revolution buildings were reconstructed to suit new purposes. For example, the Emperor Nicholas II Commercial Institute in the city was reconstructed to serve as the administrative centre for the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a function it fulfils to this day. Other buildings, such as the Potemkin Palace were given over to &quot;the proletariat&quot; (the working man), in this case as the students&#x27; union of the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the appointment of Nikita Khrushchev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city.

As a result of all this industrialisation the city&#x27;s inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city&#x27;s left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began. The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era (Khrushchyovkas) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German Plattenbaus). In 1976, in line with the city&#x27;s 1926 renaming, a large monumental statue of Grigoriy Petrovsky was placed on the square in front of the city&#x27;s railway station.

Since the independence of Ukraine in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city&#x27;s outskirts. To this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city&#x27;s centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, while residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city has a large number of &#x27;private sectors&#x27; where the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day.

The local statue of Lenin was toppled by protesters in February 2014 the day after Ukraine&#x27;s president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia following months of protests against him. The square were the statue had stood for some 50 years was soon renamed from &quot;Lenin Square&quot; to &quot;Heroes of Maidan Square&quot;.

In late November 2015 about 300 streets, 5 of the 8 city districts and one metro station were renamed to comply with decommunization laws.

The 1976 Petrovsky statue was destroyed by an angry mob on 29 January 2016.

As part of the derussification campaign that swept through Ukraine following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, 110 toponyms in the city were renamed from February to September 2022. On 3 May 2022 alone more than a dozen memorials erected during Soviet times were dismantled. In December 2022 the Dnipro communal services (in accordance a decision of the City Council) removed from the city all monuments to figures of Russian culture and history. This meant that monuments to Alexander Pushkin, Alexander Matrosov, Volodia Dubinin, Maxim Gorky, Valery Chkalov, Yefim Pushkin and Mikhail Lomonosov were removed from the public space of the city. On 16 November 2022 Pushkin Avenue in Dnipro had been renamed Lesya Ukrainka Avenue. In January 2023 a T-34 tank on Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt that served as a monument to Hero of the Soviet Union Yefim Pushkin was removed after the Dnipro City Council had decided the monument &quot;has no historical or artistic value.&quot; 26 more streets were renamed in Dnipro on 22 February 2023. In December 2023 the renaming of streets continued with on 20 December 2023 again 53 city toponyms their names being changed by the Dnipro City Council. Also on this day the Dnipro City Council renamed a part of Dnipro&#x27;s central avenue, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, in honor of commander of the 1st Mechanized Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Hero of Ukraine Dmytro Kotsiubailo (who had perished on 7 March 2023 in battle near Bakhmut). On 31 January 2024 92 other toponyms were renamed by the Dnipro City Council, including the avenue named after (Soviet cosmonaut and first human in space) Yuri Gagarin.

==Demographics==
The population of the city is about 1 million people. In 2011, the average age of the city&#x27;s resident population was 40 years. The number of males declined slightly more than the number of females. The natural population growth in Dnipro is slightly higher than growth in Ukraine in general.

Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of the city increased from 16% to 48%. This was part of a national trend.

In a survey in June–July 2017, 9% of residents said that they spoke Ukrainian at home, 63% spoke Russian, and 25% spoke Ukrainian and Russian equally.

The same survey reported the following results for the religion of adult residents.
*49% Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate
*6% Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate
*7% atheist
*1% belong to other religions
*28% believe in God, but do not belong to any religion
*5% found it difficult to answer

According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April–May 2023, 27% of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 66% spoke Russian.

==Economy==

Dnipro is a major industrial centre of Ukraine. It has several facilities devoted to heavy industry that produce a wide range of products, including cast-iron, launch vehicles, rolled metal, pipes, machinery, different mining combines, agricultural equipment, tractors, trolleybuses, refrigerators, different chemicals and many others. The most famous and the oldest (founded in the 19th century) is the Dniprovsky Metallurgical Plant (from 1922 until the time of decommunization in Ukraine, the plant was named after the Soviet Union statesman Grigory Petrovsky). Other notable industrial company of Dnipro is PA Pivdenmash, a heavy machinery and rocket manufacturer.

Metals and metallurgy is the city&#x27;s core industry in terms of output. Employment in the city is concentrated in large-sized enterprises. Metallurgical enterprises are based in the city and account for over 47% of its industrial output. These enterprises are important contributors to the city&#x27;s budget and, with 80% of their output being exported, to Ukraine&#x27;s foreign exchange reserve. Dnipro serves as the main import hub for foreign goods coming into the oblast and, on average, accounted for 58% of the oblast&#x27;s imports between 2005 and 2011. With economic conditions improving even further in 2010 and 2011, registered unemployment fell to about 4,100 by the end of 2011.

The city of Dnipro&#x27;s economy is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, which accounted for 53% of the output of non-financial enterprises in 2010.

Entrepreneur Ihor Kolomoyskyi&#x27;s Privat Group, a global business group, is based in the city and grouped around the Privatbank. Privat Group controls thousands of companies of virtually every industry in Ukraine, European Union, Georgia, Ghana, Russia, Romania, United States and other countries. Steel, oil &amp; gas, chemical and energy are sectors of the group&#x27;s prime influence and expertise. Privat Group is in business conflict with the Interpipe, also based in Dnipro area. The influential metallurgical mill company founded and mostly owned by the local business oligarch Viktor Pinchuk.

Another company headquartered in Dnipro is ATB-Market. This company owns the largest national network of retail shops.

None of the group&#x27;s capital is publicly traded on the stock exchange. Group&#x27;s founding owners are natives of Dnipro and made their entire career here. Privatbank, the core of the group, is the largest commercial bank in Ukraine. In March 2014 was named by the American review magazine &quot;Global Finance&quot; as &quot;the Best Bank in Ukraine for 2014&quot; while British magazine &quot;The Banker&quot; in November 2013 named again the same bank as &quot;the Bank of the year 2013 in Ukraine&quot;.

In 2018 a private Texas-based aerospace firm Firefly Aerospace opened a Research and Development (R&amp;D) centre in Dnipro to develop small and medium-sized launch vehicles for commercial launches to orbit.

==Transport==
===Local transportation===
The main forms of public transport used in Dnipro are trams, buses and electric trolley buses. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.

The city&#x27;s municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state. It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipro&#x27;s smaller roads. Major roads and highways are of better quality. In the early 2010s the situation was improving, with a number of new used trams bought from the German cities of Dresden and Magdeburg, and a number of roads, including Schmidt Street (now Stepan Bandera Street) and Moskovsky Street (now Volodymyr Monomakh Street) were being reconstructed with modern road-building techniques.
Dnipro also has a metro system, opened in 1995, which consists of one line and 6 stations. The 1980 official plans for four different lines were never made reality. In 2011 the metro was transferred to municipal ownership in the hope that this will help it secure a loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2011, plans envisioned an expansion of three station, , and , to be completed by 2015. The opening of these three stations have been repeatedly delayed, and after the February 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine all work on the expansion stopped. The extension will increase the number of stations to nine, which would extend the line 4 km to a total of 11.8 km (7.3-mile).

===Suburban transportation===
Dnipro has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from Kyiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. Transit through the city is also available. the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre.

The largest bus station in eastern Ukraine is located in Dnipro, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to Poland, Germany, Moldova and Turkey. It is located near the city&#x27;s central railway station. Since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukraine&#x27;s border crossings with Russia and Belarus are closed to regular traffic.

In the summertime, there are some routes available by hydrofoils on the Dnieper River, while various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kyiv–Kherson–Odesa) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipro&#x27;s river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river.

===Rail===

The city is a large railway junction, with many daily trains running to and from Eastern Europe and on domestic routes within Ukraine.

There are two railway terminals, Dnipro Holovnyi (main station) and Dnipro Lotsmanska (south station).

Two express passenger services run each day between Kyiv and Dnipro under the name &#x27;Capital Express&#x27;. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.

Domestic connections exist between Dnipro and Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Truskavets, Kharkiv and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, while international destinations include, among others the Bulgarian seaside resort of Varna. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine all railway connection between Ukraine and Belarus were axed. Meaning that the pre-war international destinations to Minsk in Belarus, Moscow&#x27;s Kursky Station and Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Vitebsky Station in Russia and Baku—the capital of Azerbaijan—are no longer in service.

===Aviation===
The city is served by Dnipro International Airport and is connected to European and Middle Eastern cities with daily flights. It is located southeast from the city centre. A Russian attack on 10 April 2022 completely destroyed the airport and the infrastructure nearby.

===Water transportation===
The city has a river port located on the left bank of the Dnieper. There is also a railway freight station.

==Education==
There are 163 educational institutions among them schools, gymnasiums and boarding schools. For children of pre-school age there are 174 institutions, also a lot of out-of -school institutions such as centre of out-of-school work. Eighty-seven institutions that are recognized on all Ukrainian and regional levels.

In a survey in June–July 2017, adult respondents reported the following educational levels:
*1% primary or incomplete secondary education
*13% general secondary education
*46% vocational secondary education
*39% university education (including incomplete university education)

In 2006 Dnipropetrovsk hosted the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Information Technology; in 2008, that for Mathematics, and in 2009 the semi-final of the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Programming for the Eastern Region. In the same year as the latter took place, the youth group &#x27;Eksperiment&#x27;, an organisation promoting increased cultural awareness amongst Ukrainians, was founded in the city.

===Higher education===
Dnipro is a major educational centre in Ukraine and is home to two of Ukraine&#x27;s top-ten universities; the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University and Dnipro Polytechnic National Technical University.
The system of high education institutions connects 38 institutions in Dnipro, among them 14 of IV and ІІІ levels of accreditation, and 22 of І and ІІ levels of accreditation. In year 2012 National Mining Institute was on the 7th and National University named after O. Honchar was on the 9th place among the best high education institutions in &quot;TOP-200 Ukraine&quot; list.
The list below is a list of all current state-organised higher educational institutions (not included are non-independent subdivisions of other universities not based in Dnipro).
In the 21st century annually around 55,000 students studied in Dnipro, a significant number of whom students from abroad.

==Culture==
===Attractions===

Dnipro has a variety of theatres (Dnipro Academic Drama and Comedy Theatre, Taras Shevchenko Dnipro Academic Ukrainian Music and Drama Theatre and Dnipro Opera and Ballet Theatre), a circus (Dnipro State Circus) and several museums (Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum, Diorama &quot;Battle of the Dnieper&quot; and Dnipro Art Museum). There are also several restaurants, beaches and parks (Taras Shevchenko Park and Sevastopol Park).

The major streets of the city were renamed in honour of Marxist heroes during the Soviet era. Following the 2015 law on decommunization these have been renamed.

The central thoroughfare is known as Akademik Yavornytskyi Prospekt, a wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is Soborna Square, which includes the Transfiguration Cathedral founded by order of Catherine the Great in 1787. On the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, Diorama &quot;Battle of the Dnieper&quot; (World War II).

The Ukrposhta for the city was once housed at the Central Post Office, a 20th-century building. Rising magnificently above the Dnieper, the building&#x27;s tower has become one of the most identifiable features in the city.

Further from the city centre and next to the Dnieper River (spelled &quot;Dnipro&quot; in Ukrainian) is the large Taras Shevchenko Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and Monastyrskyi Island. In the 9th century, Byzantine monks based a monastery here.

The Governor&#x27;s House is a 19th-century building which formerly housed the Governor of Yekaterinoslav. Since 2020, it became the home of the Museum of Dnipro City History.

A few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between Lesya Ukrainka Avenue and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as Chkalov park until it was renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years.

The river keeps the climate mild. It is visible from many points in Dnipro. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.

There was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.

=== Religion ===
Ludwig Charlemagne-Bode and Pietro Visconti designed and erected the 19th century Holy Trinity Cathedral in Dnipro, which is an Eastern Orthodox cathedral of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate. It was known as the Trinity Church for most of the 1800s until changing to the Church of the Descent of the Holy Spirit. It is now a historical landmark within the city.

The UOC&#x27;s Dnipropetrovsk House Of Organ And Chamber Music is a performance hall and an Eastern Orthodox cathedral from the 20th century. In addition, the structure is a national architectural and historical landmark.

The Saint Nicholas Church in Dnipro is a national monument and the Eastern Orthodox cathedral of the UOC from the 19th century. It is located on what was formerly Novi Kodaky property and is the oldest church in Dnipro.

The German Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Ukraine (GELCU) owns the 19th-century Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Catherine. It is also known as the St. Catherine Evangelical Lutheran Church. It is the first church in Ukraine to open after independence.

===Sports===
FC Dnipro is the most successful football club of the city. It is a former second runner-up in the Ukrainian Premier League and in the UEFA Cup it reached and lost the 2015 UEFA Europa League Final. It also was the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice. The club was owned by the Privat Group. The club has been inactive since 2019. Note: A bandy team, a basketball team and others use the same name.

Other local football clubs include: FC Lokomotyv Dnipropetrovsk and FC Spartak Dnipropetrovsk, both of which have large fan bases. SC Dnipro-1 is another team emerged in 2017. SC Dnipro-1 established itself as the most successful club in town; playing in the Ukrainian Premier League, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Europa Conference League.

In 2008 the city built a new soccer stadium; the Dnipro-Arena has a capacity of 31,003 people and was built as a replacement for Dnipro&#x27;s old stadium, Stadium Meteor. The Dnipro-Arena hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification game between Ukraine and England on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However, it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by UEFA. The city is home to BC Dnipro, champion of the 2019–20 Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague. The team plays its home games at the &quot;Palace of Sports Shynnik&quot;.

The city is the centre of Ukrainian bandy. The Ukrainian Federation of Bandy and Rink-Bandy has its office in the city. The foremost local bandy club is Dnipro, which won the Ukrainian championship in 2014.

<text>North Richmond is an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, California, a census-designated place (CDP) with a population of 3,717 adjacent to and nearly surrounded by the city of Richmond.

==History==
The area of North Richmond was populated by Ohlone tribes which settled the area in the 6th century. However, Hokan speaking people may have inhabited the area even earlier, and archaeological evidence shows human settlement to have begun at least by 4000 BC. The Ohlone tribesmen subsisted from hunter-gathering the bountiful amount of land and sea life of the area. Especially the great amounts of seafood made available along the coastline of Castro Cove and the surrounding marshlands and delta of Wildcat and San Pablo creeks. The majority of present-day North Richmond was territory of the Karkin tribe (or &quot;Carquinez&quot;) however the land lies on what was a border area with the Chocheño tribe and likely had influences of both groups. The tribes made great use of the salmon and trout runs on the rivers. However, today, culverting and damming has decimated the habitat for these species and they are rarely present ever at the opening of the watercourse.

In the early part of the 20th century, North Richmond was populated by Italian-Americans. During World War II, many African-Americans moved from the South and Midwest and came to the Western United States in order to find jobs contributing to the war effort. Many came to work in Richmond&#x27;s shipyards and consequently, moved into North Richmond.

Subsequently many of the residents were employed in the petroleum, railway, and shipping industries.

Currently the population is estimated to be about 2,300 by the county of Contra Costa and 2,500 by the Richmond Confidential.

==Demographics==
North Richmond first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

The 2010 United States Census reported that North Richmond had a population of 3,717. The population density was . The racial makeup of North Richmond was 1,239 (33.3%) African American, 634 (17.1%) White, 431 (11.6%) Asian, 23 (0.6%) Native American, 18 (0.5%) Pacific Islander, 1,191 (32.0%) from other races, and 181 (4.9%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,862 persons (50.1%).

The Census reported that 100% of the population lived in households.

There were 1,027 households, out of which 551 (53.7%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 412 (40.1%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 271 (26.4%) had a female householder with no husband present, 95 (9.3%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 86 (8.4%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 4 (0.4%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 184 households (17.9%) were made up of individuals, and 70 (6.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.62. There were 778 families (75.8% of all households); the average family size was 4.02.

The population was spread out, with 1,152 people (31.0%) under the age of 18, 456 people (12.3%) aged 18 to 24, 1,187 people (31.9%) aged 25 to 44, 712 people (19.2%) aged 45 to 64, and 210 people (5.6%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29.0 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.7 males.

There were 1,237 housing units at an average density of , of which 1,027 were occupied, of which 471 (45.9%) were owner-occupied, and 556 (54.1%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.4%; the rental vacancy rate was 14.6%. 1,692 people (45.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,025 people (54.5%) lived in rental housing units.

==Government==

The West Contra Costa Housing Authority of Contra Costa County is located in North Richmond. The area is policed by the Contra Costa County Sheriff&#x27;s department. The community is governed by the county of Contra Costa and the current representative is supervisor John Gioia.

At a community level the town does not have a city council or its own neighborhood councils. North Richmond does, though, have a community council that represents the resident&#x27;s voices at the county level, known as the North Richmond Municipal Advisory Council.

Richmond has considered annexing North Richmond several times since the 1960s. In fall 2011, the neighboring city of San Pablo conducted a telephone opinion poll of San Pablo residents. Among other items, the poll sought to assess San Pablo citizens&#x27; opinions on the possibility of the City of San Pablo annexing unincorporated North Richmond. Reasons cited included the opportunity for North Richmond residents to have direct representation and also give San Pablo waterfront access to San Pablo Bay.

== Recreation ==

Sports such as baseball and basketball are common in the neighborhood, especially for young men. Baseball has been a long tradition in the area for decades, with residents frequently playing at the North Richmond Ballfield Complex and at Shields-Reid Park. The Bay Area&#x27;s Hyphy scene is popular among many young people who aspire to be rappers and singers. Hip hop, Rap, and R&amp;B music, as with many areas densely populated by African Americans, is prominent among the area&#x27;s youth.

== Transportation ==

This area is served by AC Transit bus lines 76, 71, and 376, that connect the community with Richmond BART &amp; Amtrak station, Contra Costa College in San Pablo, and Hilltop Mall in addition to other areas of west county. The line 376 is an owl service, and due to several assaults and other crimes committed on board during 2010 the bus is now escorted by a county sheriff&#x27;s vehicle while inside town limits. In fact, many bus drivers refuse to work this line because of how dangerous it can be. Richmond Parkway, a connector between I-580 at Point Richmond and I-80 at the Hilltop area, runs through the west of North Richmond.

==Crime==
The area has one of the highest per-capita homicide rates in the nation. Coupled with the highest homicide rate, citizens have complained that law enforcement is ineffective in dealing with shootings in their community and that killers are almost never brought to justice.

== Environment ==

North Richmond is next to Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond&#x27;s Point Richmond District. The public health risks associated with emissions and chemical spills, especially of sulfur trioxide, are major concerns for the entire area. A community warning system of loud sirens is in place to warn residents of chemical spills. This warning is tested on the first Wednesday of every month, and can be heard from miles away. The Richmond dump is also in a tiny strip of Richmond that runs through North Richmond.

The landfill pays into a mitigation fund used for community projects to offset how blight and pollution impact the town. In 2011 $56,000 were granted out of a $100,000 budget to building community gardens on vacant lots leased to the volunteer effort. The project aims to provide education and training for the cultivation and eating of healthful vegetables. Although the gardens will provide otherwise unavailable produce, North Richmonders still have to go to San Pablo or Richmond areas for groceries.

==Economy==

North Richmond has an extensive industrial history. Today, an important industry in this town is Action Recycling, which purchases bulk scrap metal in addition to more traditional plastics, bottles, cans, and cardboard from patrons. The community is home to many farms and greenhouses; thousands of flowers both within and surrounding these greenhouses can be seen from the Richmond Parkway.

There are very few commercial businesses in the town but there are two small grocers and a liquor store remaining.

A Native American tribe, the Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of Lake County, has proposed and received approval for Sugar Bowl Casino on a 28-acre (≈11 hectare) site that they have purchased. Although some local clergy have allegedly expressed feelings of disapproval, the impoverished community has generally welcomed the project as a potentially good source of revenue. The tribe&#x27;s proposal includes an outreach program that focuses on the similarity between the struggles of their own people and that of African Americans.

The county government has plans to improve the community with new mixed use residential developments on brownfields, new businesses, parks and open spaces.

There are currently no restaurants or markets in the town. The city of Richmond&#x27;s redevelopment agency and Contra Costa County have been trying to revitalize the community&#x27;s main road, Fred Jackson Way (formerly 3rd and Filbert Streets). In 2010 a thirty-six town home development was under construction to provide ultra low income housing that is planned to be kept affordable over time through a low equity scheme.

A county assessment has stated that the town is ideal for warehousing businesses due to its strategic location between Marin County, Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley in addition to its easy access to major freeways, railways, and an available workforce with affordable housing.

<text>&#x27; () is a Koine Greek adjective used in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer verse &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Give us today our bread&#x27;). Because the word is used nowhere else, its meaning is unclear. It is traditionally translated as &quot;daily&quot;, but most modern scholars reject that interpretation. The word is also referred to by &#x27;, its presumed lemma form.

Since it is a Koine Greek &quot;dis legomenon&quot; (a word that occurs only twice within a given context) found only in the New Testament passages Matthew 6:11 and Luke 11:3, its interpretation relies upon morphological analysis and context. The traditional and most common English translation is &quot;daily&quot;, although most scholars today reject this in part because all other New Testament passages with the translation &quot;daily&quot; include the word (, &#x27;day&#x27;).

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; holds that there are several ways of understanding (which the &quot;Catechism&quot; calls ), including the traditional &#x27;daily&#x27;, but most literally as &#x27;supersubstantial&#x27; or &#x27;superessential&#x27;, based on its morphological components. Alternative theories are that—aside from the etymology of , meaning &#x27;substance&#x27;—it may be derived from either of the verbs (), meaning &quot;to be&quot;, or (), meaning both &quot;to come&quot; and &quot;to go&quot;.

==Appearances and uniqueness==

The word is visible in the Hanna Papyrus 1 (𝔓75), the oldest surviving witness for certain New Testament passages.

 is the only adjective in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. It is masculine, accusative, singular, agreeing in gender, number, and case with the noun it qualifies, , (&quot;bread&quot;). In an interlinear gloss:

In the 20th century, another supposed instance appeared to come to light. In an Egyptian papyrus dated to the 5th century CE which contains a shopping list, a word transcribed as was reported as being next to the names of several grocery items. This seemed to indicate that it was used in the sense of &quot;enough for today&quot;, &quot;enough for tomorrow&quot;, or &quot;necessary&quot;. However, after the papyrus containing the shopping list, missing for many years, was rediscovered at the Yale Beinecke Library in 1998, a re-examination found the word (oil), not (the original transcriber, A. H. Sayce, was apparently known to be a poor transcriber). In addition, the document was reassessed to date from the first or second century CE, not the 5th century. Therefore, the use of seems indeed to occur nowhere else in ancient Greek literature besides Matthew, Luke, and &quot;Didache&quot;.

, used in Acts 7:26 and elsewhere to refer to the day, may be a cognate word.

==Translations and interpretations==
There are several reasons that presents an exceptional translation challenge. The word appears nowhere else in other Ancient Greek texts, and so may have been coined by the authors of the Gospel. Jesus probably did not originally compose the prayer in Greek, but in his native language (either Aramaic or Hebrew), but the consensus view is that the New Testament was originally written in Koine Greek. This implies the probability of language interpretation (i.e., spoken Aramaic to written Greek) at the outset of recording the Gospel. Thus, the meaning of any such word is often difficult to determine, because cross-references and comparisons with other usages are not possible, except by morphological analysis.

The most popular morphological analysis sees prefix and a polysemantic word even though that does not follow the standard Greek form of building compound words. Usually the iota at the end of would be dropped in a compound whose second word starts with a vowel (compare, e. g., eponym &quot;vs&quot; epigraph). This is not an absolute rule, however: Jean Carmignac has collected 26 compound words that violate it. Alternatively, the word may be analyzed as a feminine participle from two different verbs.

To sum up, both modern and ancient scholars have proposed several different translations for . Even Jerome, the most important translator of the Bible to Latin, translated this same word in the same context in two different ways. Today there is no consensus on the exact meaning. What follows is a review of the alternative translations:

===Daily===
&quot;Daily&quot; has long been the most common English translation of . It is the term used in the Tyndale Bible, the King James Version, and in the most popular modern English versions. This rests on the analysis of as &quot;for&quot; and as &quot;being&quot;; the word would mean &quot;for the [day] being&quot; with &quot;day&quot; being implicit.

This version is based on the Latin rendering of as , rather than the alternative Latin translation of . This interpretation is first recorded in the works of Tertullian, and is the translation found in the Tridentine Mass.

Some translators have proposed slight variations on &quot;daily&quot; as the most accurate. Richard Francis Weymouth, an English schoolmaster, translated it as &quot;bread for today&quot; in the Weymouth New Testament. Edgar J. Goodspeed in An American Translation used &quot;bread for the day.&quot; Another option is to view as an allusion to Exodus 16:4 where God promises to provide a day&#x27;s portion of manna every day. This verse could be an attempt to translate the Hebrew of &quot;bread sufficient to the day&quot; into Greek.

The word () is found in Acts 7:26, 16:11, 20:15, 21:18 and 23:11. This word is typically taken to mean &quot;next&quot; in the context of &quot;the next day or night&quot;. It has been suggested that is a masculinised version of .

Today, most scholars reject the translation of as meaning &quot;daily&quot;. The word &quot;daily&quot; only has a weak connection to any proposed etymologies for . Moreover, all other instances of &quot;daily&quot; in the English New Testament translate (, &quot;day&quot;), which does not appear in this usage. Because there are several other Greek words based on that mean &quot;daily&quot;, no reason is apparent to use such an obscure word as . The &quot;daily&quot; translation also makes the term redundant, with &quot;this day&quot; already making clear the bread is for the current day.

===Supersubstantial===
In the Vulgate Jerome translated in Matthew 6:11 as &quot;supersubstantial&quot; (Latin: ), coining a new word not before seen in Latin. This came from the analysis of the prefix as &quot;super&quot; and in the sense of &quot;substance&quot;. The Catholic Church believes that this, or &quot;superessential&quot;, is the most literal English translation via Latin, which lacks a grammatical form for &quot;being&quot;, the literal translation of the Greek , and so substance or essence are used instead.

====Advocates====
This interpretation was supported by early writers such as Augustine, Cyril of Jerusalem, Cyprian of Carthage and John Cassian.

This translation is used by some modern Bibles. In the Douay-Rheims Bible English translation of the Vulgate (Matthew 6:11) reads &quot;give us this day our supersubstantial bread&quot;. The translation of &quot;supersubstantial bread&quot; has also been associated with the Eucharist, as early as in the time of the Church Fathers and later also by the Council of Trent (1551).

In 1979, the , also called the Neo-Vulgate, became the official Latin edition of the Bible published by the Holy See for use in the contemporary Roman rite. It is not an edition of the historical Vulgate, but a revision of the text intended to accord with modern critical Hebrew and Greek texts and produce a style closer to classical Latin. The retains the same correspondence-of-meaning for in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer contained in the Gospel according to Matthew and Luke as in the Vulgate, i.e., and .

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, there are several meanings to , and that is most literally translated as &quot;super-essential&quot;:

&quot;Daily&quot; () occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of &quot;this day,&quot; to confirm us in trust &quot;without reservation.&quot; Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence. Taken literally (: &quot;super-essential&quot;), it refers directly to the Bread of Life, the Body of Christ, the &quot;medicine of immortality,&quot; without which we have no life within us. Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is evident: &quot;this day&quot; is the Day of the Lord, the day of the feast of the kingdom, anticipated in the Eucharist that is already the foretaste of the kingdom to come. For this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic liturgy to be celebrated each day.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, &quot;supersubstantial&quot; is thought to be a more accurate translation. Here is how Father Thomas Hopko of Saint Vladimir&#x27;s Seminary in New York explains it:

 [...] [is] an absolutely unique word. Etymologically [...], means &quot;on top of&quot; and means &quot;substance&quot; or &quot;being&quot;. So it means suprasubstantial bread. Suprasubstantial bread: more-than-necessary bread. In the first Latin translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, done by Jerome it was [...], . Somewhere along the way it became &quot;, daily&quot;. Luther translated &quot;daily&quot; from the beginning: .

But in all languages that traditionally Eastern Christians use—Greek, Slavonic, and all the Arabic languages: Aramaic, Arabic—it doesn&#x27;t say that; it just says a word that&#x27;s similar to that [...] How do they translate it [into those languages]? [...] they claim that the best translation would be: &quot;Give us today the bread of tomorrow&quot;. Give us today the bread of the coming age, the bread that when you eat it, you can never die. What is the food of the coming age? It&#x27;s God himself, God&#x27;s word, God&#x27;s Son, God&#x27;s lamb, God&#x27;s bread, which we already have here on earth, on earth, before the second coming. So what we&#x27;re really saying is, &quot;Feed us today with the bread of the coming age&quot;, because we are taught by Jesus not to seek the bread that perishes, but the bread that, you eat it, you can never die.

====Eucharist metaphor====
This translation has often been connected to the eucharist. The bread necessary for existence is the communion bread of the Last Supper. That the gospel writers needed to create a new word indicates to Eugene LaVerdiere, an American Catholic priest and biblical scholar of the post-Vatican II era, that they are describing something new. Eating the communion bread at the Last Supper created the need for a new word for this new concept.

&quot;Supersubstantial&quot; was the dominant Latin translation of from Matthew for many centuries after Jerome, and influenced church ritual. It was the basis for the argument advanced by theologians such as Cyprian that communion must be eaten daily. That only bread is mentioned led to the practice of giving the laity only the bread and not the wine of the Eucharist. This verse was cited in arguments against the Utraquists. The translation was reconsidered with the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther originally kept &quot;supersubstantial&quot; but switched to &quot;daily&quot; by 1528.

====Criticisms====
Those rejecting this translation include some Roman Catholic Biblical scholars, such as Raymond E. Brown, Jean Carmignac, and Nicholas Ayo.

There is no known source word from Aramaic or Hebrew, the native languages of Jesus, that translates into the Greek word . In fact, there is no word in either of these languages that easily translates as &quot;supersubstantial&quot;, a unique translation for a unique Greek word.

M. Eugene Boring, a Protestant theologian at Texas Christian University, claims that the connection with the Eucharist is ahistoric because he thinks that the ritual only developed some time after the Gospel was written and that the author of Matthew does not seem to have any knowledge of or interest in the Eucharist. Craig Blomberg, also a Protestant New Testament scholar, agrees that these &quot;concepts had yet to be introduced when Jesus gave his original prayer and therefore could not have been part of his original meaning.&quot;

===Necessary for existence===
Another interpretation is to link to the Greek word meaning both the verb &quot;to be&quot; and the noun &quot;substance.&quot; Origen was the first writer to comment on the unusual word. A native Greek speaker writing a century and half after the Gospels were composed, he did not recognize the word and thought it was an original neologism. Origen thought &quot;bread necessary for existence&quot; was the most likely meaning, connecting it to the &quot;to be&quot; translation of .

George Ricker Berry translated the word as simply &quot;necessary&quot; in 1897. Philosopher Raïssa Maritain, wife of philosopher Jacques Maritain, writes that during her era of the 1940s this translation was found to be the most acceptable by modern scholars. Her own conclusion was stated as being in agreement with Theodore of Mopsuestia, that being the &quot;bread we need.&quot; This was seen as vague enough to cover what was viewed as the three possible etymological meanings: (1) literal – the &quot;bread of tomorrow or the bread of the present day,&quot; (2) analogical – the &quot;bread we need in order to subsist,&quot; and (3) spiritual/mystical – the bread &quot;which is above our substance&quot; (i.e., supersubstantial).

Joseph Fitzmyer translates the verse as &quot;give us this day our bread for subsistence.&quot; He connects this to the Aramaic targum translations of Proverbs 30:8.

Like &quot;daily&quot;, this translation also has the problem that there are well known Greek words that could have been used instead.

===For the future===
The &quot;for the future&quot; translation is today held by the majority of scholars. Early supporters of this translation include Cyril of Alexandria and Peter of Laodicea by way of linking with the verb , &quot;of tomorrow.&quot; According to Jewish theologian Herbert Basser, this translation was also considered (but eventually rejected) as a possibility by Jerome, who noted it as an aside in his commentary to Matthew that the Gospel of the Hebrews used (&quot;for tomorrow&quot;) in this verse.

Raymond E. Brown claims it is also indicated by early Bohairic and Sahidic sources. Referencing in Acts 7:26, the Lutheran theologian Albert Schweitzer, reintroduced this translation in modern times. A &quot;for the future&quot; reading leads to a cluster of related translations, including: &quot;bread for tomorrow,&quot; &quot;bread for the future,&quot; and &quot;bread for the coming day.&quot;

Beyond the literal meaning, this translation can also be read in an eschatological context: &quot;the petition for an anticipation of the world to come.&quot; Others see &quot;tomorrow&quot; being referenced to the end times and the bread that of the messianic feast. Raymond Brown argues that all the other phrases of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer are eschatological, so it would be incongruous for this phrase to be speaking prosaically about bread for eating. Eduard Schweizer, a Swiss protestant New Testament scholar and theologian, disagrees. Humble bread was not traditionally presented as part of the messianic feast and the prosaic need for bread to survive would have been a universal sentiment of Jesus&#x27; followers.

The Catholic theologian Brant Pitre acknowledges the &quot;for the future&#x27;&quot; interpretation is held by a majority of scholars, but criticizes it for lacking support among ancient Christian interpreters. Pitre also cites that an adjectival form for &quot;tomorrow&quot; exists in ancient Greek, in Matthew 6:34, and could have been used instead of the one-time-use .

Another potential issue with a &quot;for the future&quot; translation is it seems to contradict Matthew 6:31, where only a few verses later Jesus tells his followers not to worry about food, that God will take care of such needs. W.D. Davies, a Welsh Congregationalist scholar, and Dale Allison, an American New Testament scholar, however, do not see a contradiction: Matthew 6:34 tells one not to be anxious about such needs: that a pious person asks God in prayer for these needs to be filled, may rather be why there is no need to worry.

===Doesn&#x27;t run out===
Kenneth E. Bailey, a professor of theology and linguistics, proposed &quot;give us today the bread that doesn&#x27;t run out&quot; as the correct translation. 

The Syriac versions of the Bible were some of the first translations of the Gospels from the Greek into another language. Syriac is also close to Jesus&#x27; own Aramaic, and the translators close in time and language to Jesus should thus have had considerable insight into his original meanings. In Syriac is translated as , meaning lasting, perpetual, constant, trustworthy, never-ceasing, never-ending, or always.

===Estate===
Lutheran scholar Douglas E. Oakman suggests &quot;give us today bread in abundance&quot; as another translation. He notes that in the contemporary literature can mean substance, but it also has a concrete meaning of a large, substantial, estate. Thus as a cognate of the word , could refer to plentiful or abundant bread.

Oakman also notes contemporary sources that translate as the royal or imperial estate and proposes that the verse could originally have meant &quot;give us the royal bread ration for today.&quot;

===That belongs to it===
Davies and Allison state that the verse has also been translated as &quot;give us this day the bread that belongs to it,&quot; though they concede that this expression is little recognized by modern scholars.

== By language family ==
===Slavonic translations===
The Old Church Slavonic canon translates &quot;epiousion&quot; variously as well. For example, Codex Marianus translates it as (, which appears to be a calque of using the etymology with debatable semantics) in Luke 11:3 but (, &#x27;for the coming day&#x27;) in Matthew 6:11. Sava&#x27;s book agrees in the latter case, but has (, &#x27;daily&#x27;) in the former, while Codex Zographensis has () and () respectively.

The New Church Slavonic version has the calque () in both cases now, following 16th-century Ostrog Bible, and the dictionaries translate the New Church Slavonic word as &#x27;necessary for existence&#x27; (note that the sense of the word likely changed in course of the time), from which derives Russian .

<doc id="989832" wikidata="Q5515164" url="?curid=989832" title="G for George">
<text>G for George is an Avro Lancaster Mk. I bomber, squadron code AR-G and serial number &quot;W4783&quot;, operated by No. 460 Squadron RAAF during World War II. It is now preserved at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra, Australia.

==History==
G-George flew 90 operational sorties over occupied Europe with 460 Squadron, and is the second most prolific surviving Lancaster, behind &quot;R5868&quot; S for Sugar of No. 83 Squadron RAF/No. 463 Squadron RAAF/No. 467 Squadron RAAF (137 sorties). Most operational Lancasters were shot down before they had reached 20 sorties: of the 107,085 sorties by Lancasters despatched in bombing raids on Germany 2,687 aircraft went missing. G-George has the added distinction of bringing home, alive, every crewman who flew aboard it.

Upon retirement from combat duty in 1944, G-George was flown to Australia by an all-RAAF crew of Bomber Command veterans, and played a major part in raising war bonds during a round-Australia publicity trip. Post-war, it was left to decay in the open air at RAAF Base Fairbairn, before being moved to the AWM in the early 1950s.

In 2003, G-George returned to display at the AWM in the new ANZAC Hall after a five-year restoration program at the Treloar Technology Centre, which restored the aircraft as faithfully as possible to its wartime configuration. It is displayed in conjunction with a sound and light show that attempts to convey something of the atmosphere of a World War II Bomber Command raid, and incorporates a German &#x27;88&#x27; flak gun and a Bf 109 fighter. The display is based on a sortie captained by Flying Officer &quot;Cherry&quot; Carter to Berlin on &quot;Black Thursday&quot; December 1943, so called because Bomber Command lost 50 of the 500 bombers detailed for the raid - more than half were lost in landing accidents due to bad weather.

G-George serves as a memorial to all Australians who flew with Bomber Command, and to the 1,018 dead of 460 Squadron.

The designation &#x27;G-George&#x27; comes from the RAF phonetic alphabet in use at the time. Individual aircraft of a squadron were allocated a letter and would be referred to using the corresponding word from the phonetic alphabet. This identification letter (&#x27;G&#x27;) would be painted on the side of the aircraft in conjunction with the two-letter squadron code, in this case &#x27;AR-G&#x27;. Many other RAF squadrons would also have had their own &#x27;G-George&#x27;, but allied to a different squadron code such as Spitfire &#x27;XE-G&#x27; belonging to No. 123 squadron RAF.

<text>Penny&#x27;s Bay or Chok Ko Wan () is a bay in north-eastern Lantau Island, and had been a port since the Ming dynasty. The bay has since been reclaimed and is the site of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which consists of the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park, Disneyland Hotel, and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Hotel, and the Inspiration Lake. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became home to Penny&#x27;s Bay Community Isolation Facility. It is connected by a highway and a rail connection on the MTR Disneyland Resort line to Sunny Bay station.

Penny&#x27;s Bay is located in Tsuen Wan District, but a small southern portion falls in Islands District.

==Dioxin contamination==
Before the reclamation of the bay, Cheoy Lee Shipyard operated in the bay from 1964 to April 2001. The Government acquired the land from the owners for the sum of HK$1.48 billion, and paid HK$22.7 million in additional compensation, according to a Public Works Subcommittee paper from May 2002.

The Government had not realised that its operations accumulated of soil contaminated with dioxin, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons. The solid waste was dug up and transferred to To Kau Wan on the north shore of Northeast Lantau for temporary processing, and finally incinerated at the Chemical Waste Treatment Centre on the Tsing Yi Island amid protests by residents. The total cleanup cost not taken into account at the time of acquisition was estimated at HK$450 million.

== Penny&#x27;s Bay Community Isolation Facility ==

Penny&#x27;s Bay Community Isolation Facility (formerly Penny&#x27;s Bay Quarantine Centre, ) has a total capacity of 1,916 people. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, in 2021 it was used to house US arrivals to Hong Kong for one week as part of a mandatory quarantine applicable to travellers regardless of testing or vaccine status. In 2022, it was changed to a quarantine facility for mild-symptom cases.
Hong Kong&#x27;s last remaining community isolation centre for Covid patients, Penny&#x27;s Bay on Lantau, officially closed 1 March 2023.

<doc id="989845" wikidata="Q460242" url="?curid=989845" title="Little Brother (group)">
<text>Little Brother is an American hip hop duo from Durham, North Carolina, that consists of rappers Phonte and Big Pooh. DJ and producer 9th Wonder was an original member of the group but departed in 2007. The group has produced five acclaimed studio albums and six mixtapes. Little Brother is highly regarded among hip hop fans and critics.

==History==

===Early career and &quot;The Listening&quot; album===
The individual members of the group, rappers Phonte (Phonte Coleman), and Rapper Big Pooh (Thomas Jones), and DJ/producer 9th Wonder (Pat Douthit), met in 1998 while enrolled as college students at North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina. The group began as a trio. Little Brother were members of the North Carolina–based alternative hip hop collective, Justus League.

In a February 2003 interview with &quot;MVRemix.com&quot;, Phonte explained the origins of the group&#x27;s name:

The official debut for Little Brother came in August 2001 with their first recording, &quot;Speed&quot;.

According to 9th Wonder in an interview with Complex, another rapper Median was actually supposed to be on the track before they got a hold of Big Pooh:

They continued to work the local, Raleigh Durham–area scene and were eventually signed by independent record label ABB Records. In 2002, they released the cult hit 7&quot; single &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, with lyrics centering on video games.

In 2003, the group released their first full-length studio album, &quot;The Listening&quot; to critical acclaim. National recognition for the group, and particularly 9th Wonder, came when Jay-Z tapped 9th Wonder for the song &quot;Threat&quot;, from his eighth studio album &quot;The Black Album&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;The Listening&quot;, Little Brother opened for Oakland-based alternative hip hop collective Hieroglyphics on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Full Circle&quot; national tour.

===&quot;The Chittlin&#x27; Circuit 1.5&quot; mixtape===
Little Brother&#x27;s first commercially distributed &quot;mixtape&quot;, which featured the song by Consequence titled I See Now featuring Kanye West, off of the album Take &#x27;em To The Cleaners. Released on June 21, 2005, ahead of their sophomore album &quot;The Minstrel Show&quot;.

===&quot;The Minstrel Show&quot; album===
Little Brother&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Minstrel Show&quot;, released in September 2005, saw increased success for the group due to their raised popularity and praise for the album from critics. The album&#x27;s theme compared present day rap music and the music industry to the minstrel shows of the late 19th century. A music video for the single, &quot;Lovin&#x27; It&quot; featuring Joe Scudda, was directed by Joey Boukadakis.

In 2005, Little Brother became embroiled in a short-lived feud, when Young Jeezy&#x27;s protégé Slick Pulla challenged the group to a battle after hearing an interview in which Phonte voiced some disapproval concerning &quot;drug rap&quot; and Young Jeezy&#x27;s &quot;snowman mascot&quot;. Little Brother did not respond, and instead, Phonte called Slick Pulla and the pair resolved the misunderstanding.

===&quot;Getback&quot; album and 9th Wonder&#x27;s departure===
In late 2006, Little Brother began recording their third album, and second for Atlantic Records, &quot;Getback&quot;. However, in January 2007, the group announced both their departure from Atlantic and that producer 9th Wonder had left the group.

The move from Atlantic was due to the commercial failure of &quot;The Minstrel Show&quot;, and creative differences over the group&#x27;s future material. Rapper Big Pooh said:

The group&#x27;s manager Big Dho added that there were no &quot;ill feelings towards their (Atlantic) company.&quot;

The group&#x27;s reason for the break from Atlantic and for 9th Wonder&#x27;s departure was ultimately due to creative differences, but in both cases, the break and departure were described as amicable.

As to 9th Wonder&#x27;s departure from the group, Rapper Big Pooh was quoted as saying:

On October 23, 2007, Little Brother released &quot;Getback&quot;, the long-awaited follow-up to &quot;The Minstrel Show&quot;. With no major video or radio airplay, &quot;Getback&quot; sold approximately 9,600 copies during its first week in stores and landed at No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart. The album consisted of 11 songs, and featured several guests, most notably New Orleans–based rapper Lil Wayne. Lil Wayne had been a longtime fan of the group&#x27;s work and was invited to rap on the third verse for &quot;Breakin My Heart&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Getback&quot; in late 2007, Little Brother toured with Los Angeles–based alternative hip hop artist Evidence of Dilated Peoples.

The remainder of 2007 found Little Brother working on becoming completely independent artists and putting out records on their own. Big Pooh told &quot;L.A. Record&quot; in an April 2008 interview that &quot;For the next record, we definitely want ownership—the first record we&#x27;ll have 100% ownership of.&quot;

===&quot;...And Justus For All&quot; mixtape===
Following the release of &quot;Getback&quot;, in mid-2008, Little Brother officially released their 2007 mixtape &quot;...And Justus For All&quot; with DJ Mick Boogie taking over production duties for the departed 9th Wonder. The mixtape was released through the Hall of Justus collective with Little Brother controlling the project.

In a June 2008 interview with &quot;HipHopDX.com&quot;, Rapper Big Pooh said:

&quot;...And Justus For All&quot; featured 5 new songs as well as enhanced mastered versions of songs on their 2007 mixtape with DJ Mick Boogie. The CD version contained five new songs for the album and the iTunes version had seven new songs. The iTunes version linked former groupmate 9th Wonder to the group with the single, &quot;Black Light Special&quot;.

===Individual member side projects===
Outside of Little Brother, Phonte began a collaboration with Netherlands-based producer Nicolay as the group The Foreign Exchange, that ultimately resulted in the release of their debut album, &quot;Connected&quot;, in 2004. The Foreign Exchange released their follow-up album entitled &quot;Leave It All Behind&quot;, in October 2008.

Rapper Big Pooh released a solo album entitled &quot;Sleepers&quot; in 2005. In 2009, he released two albums, &quot;The Delightful Bars&quot;, and &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;. In early 2010, Rapper Big Pooh released &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; mixtape as a free download. This mixtape featured Big Pooh rhyming over Detroit-based producer Black Milk&#x27;s instrumentals from a collection that used Prince &quot;Purple Rain&quot; album samples.

9th Wonder has produced songs for major artists like Jay-Z, De La Soul, Kendrick Lamar, Wale and Destiny&#x27;s Child, as well as underground artists such as Sean Price and Rapsody. 9th Wonder has produced entire, full-length studio albums for Jean Grae (&quot;Jeanius&quot;), Murs (&quot;Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,&quot; &quot;Murray&#x27;s Revenge, Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;The Final Adventure,&quot; just to name a few), Buckshot (&quot;Chemistry&quot; and &quot;The Formula&quot;), as well as a remix album of Nas&#x27; &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; entitled &quot;God&#x27;s Stepson&quot;.

===&quot;Leftback&quot; album, hiatus, and disbandment===
During a May 2008 interview with &quot;HipHopGame.com&quot;, Rapper Big Pooh hinted that he and Phonte may never record another album together:

In June 2009, Phonte announced the forthcoming Little Brother album, &quot;Leftback&quot;, but also announced that the group would subsequently take a Black Star-esque hiatus, wherein he and Big Pooh would continue to collaborate on projects, but that another group album would not be released for a long while.

Shortly before the April 2010 release of what would become Little Brother&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Leftback&quot;, Phonte and 9th Wonder exchanged pointed Twitter messages regarding Little Brothers&#x27; release of a previously unreleased 9th Wonder produced single, &quot;Star&quot;, on the &quot;Leftback&quot; album.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Leftback&quot; on April 10, 2010, Little Brother formally announced the group&#x27;s breakup. Rapper Big Pooh noted:

Phonte added:

===Reunion &amp; &quot;May The Lord Watch&quot;===
The reunion of Little Brother was, in part, due to the death of Phife Dawg in 2016. At this time Rapper Big Pooh and Phonte had not spoken in 5 years. Pooh sent Phonte a short message of love and appreciation. Phonte followed this text with a phone call where the two were said to have spoken for several hours. This and many followup conversations allowed the duo to rekindle their friendship.

Phonte, Rapper Big Pooh and 9th Wonder reunited on stage together for the first time in eleven years at their hometown in the 2018 Art of Cool Festival. This reunion was the result of Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; being unable to attend the festival. According to Phonte, he was contacted by the promoters to substitute for Royce and called Pooh and 9th to collaborate with him. The group had not performed together in over a decade, so they performed many of their known hits including &quot;Say it Again,&quot; &quot;Loving It&quot;, &quot;The Way You Do It,&quot; and &quot;Dreams.&quot; Both artists felt that the energy from the show was a good omen, and after leaving the stage they knew they had something special. Following this performance, Phonte invited Pooh to a barbecue at his home where they decided to continue the collaboration.

In May 2019, it was revealed that Little Brother was to return and release new music later in the year, announcing their appearance at the upcoming Hopscotch Music Festival at September 7, 2019, in Raleigh, North Carolina. However, it was also revealed that 9th Wonder would not be returning as a third member of the group, with Phonte and Rapper Big Pooh continuing under the name; as they have been doing since 2007.

On August 19, 2019, it was announced that Little Brother will be releasing a new album, titled &quot;May the Lord Watch&quot;, which was released the following day on the 20th. The album continues and updates the fictional UBN channel concept that was originally used for their well-known sophomore effort The Minstrel Show, and features no production from 9th Wonder; instead, working with producers such as Khrysis, Nottz, Focus and Black Milk. The album was completed in secret with many artists who featured on the album not knowing that they were contributing to a Little Brother album. The album was also remarkable for killing the singer Percy Miracles, who was an alter ego of Phonte. The first skit on the album features DJ Peter Rosenberg discussing the death of Percy. This concept was a tribute to the fact that the death of Phife Dawg was the event that brought the Phonte and Pooh back together. It was revealed in an interview on the &quot;Premium Pete Show&quot; that 9th Wonder was to have been a part of the reunion album, under its original title &quot;Homecoming&quot;. The title was changed due to Beyonce releasing &quot;&quot; to coincide with her concert film &quot;Homecoming&quot;. Phonte and Pooh decided to continue the project without 9th after several disagreements over production and touring commitments.

<text>The Alishan National Scenic Area is a mountain resort and nature reserve located in Alishan township, Chiayi County, Taiwan.

==Geography==
Alishan is in area. Notable characteristics include mountain wilderness, four villages, waterfalls, high altitude tea plantations, the Alishan Forest Railway, and a number of hiking trails. The area is popular with tourists and mountain climbers. Alishan, itself has become one of the major landmarks associated with Taiwan. The area is famous for its production of high mountain tea and wasabi.

Alishan is well known for its sunrises, sunsets, and views of a sea of clouds in the area between Alishan and Yüshan, railway station, and sacred trees. Alishan, along with Taroko Gorge and Sun Moon Lake, is one of Taiwan&#x27;s most popular scenic attractions.

==Climate==
Alishan National Scenic Area spans a broad range in altitude. Lower elevations, such as in Leye Township, share the same subtropical and tropical climate as the rest of southern Taiwan, while the climate changes to temperate and alpine as the elevation increases. Snow sometimes falls at higher elevations in the winter. Alishan is located at an altitude of 1400 to 2600 meters. The average annual temperature is about 10 degrees Celsius, coupled with abundant rainfall. 
Average temperatures are moderate:
* Low elevations: 24 °C in the summer, 16 °C in the winter.
* Medium elevations: 19 °C in the summer, 12 °C in the winter. 
* High elevations: 14 °C in the summer, 5 °C in the winter.

==Topography==
Alishan is mountainous:

*Number of peaks above 2000 meters: 25
*Highest point: Da Ta Shan (大塔山), 2,663 meters.
*Average height of Alishan Mountain Range: 2,500 meters.

==Vegetation and wildlife==
Important trees in the area include:
*&quot;Taiwania cryptomerioides&quot;, a large coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae (the same family as the next three species)
*&quot;Chamaecyparis formosensis&quot;, or Formosan Cypress
*&quot;Chamaecyparis taiwanensis&quot;
*&quot;Cunninghamia konishii&quot;
*&quot;Pinus taiwanensis&quot;, or Taiwan Red Pine
*&quot;Picea morrisonicola&quot;, or Yüshan Spruce
*&quot;Pseudotsuga sinensis&quot; var. &quot;wilsoniana&quot;, or Taiwan Douglas-fir
*&quot;Abies kawakamii&quot;, a species of conifer in the family Pinaceae, only found in Taiwan
*&quot;Tsuga chinensis&quot; var. &quot;formosana&quot;, Taiwan or Chinese Hemlock
*&quot;Ulmus uyematsui&quot;, a species of elm only found in the Alishan region

=== Sacred Trees ===
In 1906, the Japanese discovered a red cypress tree that was over 3000 years old, located next to the Alishan Forest Railway&#x27;s Sacred Tree Station. The Japanese honored it as the &quot;Sacred Tree&quot;. The tree is tall with a trunk diameter of nearly , making it one of the largest giant trees in Alishan.

The Alishan sacred tree withered due to lightning and heavy rain. It was put down in 1998 for tourists to visit. In 2006, the Chiayi County Government and the Alishan Scenic Area Administration started a voting activity to select other sacred trees as the new landmark in the scenic area. The tall, 2,300-year-old Xianglin Giant Tree received the highest number of votes and became the second generation of sacred tree.

The Giant trees are later organized and a trail is built for visitors to enter, where they can see more than 38 giant trees, most of which are hundreds of years old.

==History==

The Alishan area was originally settled by the Tsou tribe of the Taiwanese aborigines; the name derives from the aboriginal word &quot;Jarissang&quot;. Ethnic Han Chinese settlers first settled on the plains near modern-day Chiayi as early as the late Ming Dynasty (around the mid-17th century), but did not move into the mountains until the late 18th century, establishing the towns of Ruili (), Ruifeng (), Xiding (), and Fenqihu (). The resulting armed clashes between the settlers and the aborigines pushed the aborigines even further into the mountains.

Following the cession of Taiwan to Japan at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, Japanese expeditions to the area found large quantities of cypress (, or in Japanese). This led to the development of the logging industry in the area and the export of local cypress and Taiwania wood. A series of narrow-gauge railways were built in the area during this time to facilitate the transportation of lumber from the mountains to the plains below, part of which continues to operate as the Alishan Forest Railway. Several new villages also began to sprout up along the railway lines. It was also during this time that the first tourists began to visit the area. Plans were even drawn up to incorporate the area into the new Niitaka (New Highest) Arisan National Park (新高阿里山国立公園).

With the exhaustion of forest resources by the 1970s, domestic and international tourism overtook logging to become the primary economic activity in the area. The tourism industry continued to expand with the completion of the Alishan highway in the 1980s, displacing the railroad as the primary mode of transportation up the mountain. To combat the problems associated with the growing crowds of tourists and the expanding high mountain tea and wasabi plantations, the area was declared a national scenic area in 2001. The area covers the Alishan Forest Recreation Area and the Han Chinese villages of Ruili, Fengshan (), and Taihe (), as well as the Tsou people of Dabang (), Shanmei (), and Chashan (), and the administrative area spans four townships, including Meishan Township, Zhuqi Township, Fanlu Township, and Alishan Township.

On 1 December 2014, fire broke out at Alishan spreading over more than 5 hectares of land. The area affected was located near Tapang No. 3 Bridge. The fire was believed to happen due to dry ground which was vulnerable to fire because of the absence of rain in the area for months.

== Tourists ==
In October 2014, The Chiayi Forestry Administration pointed out that the park&#x27;s facilities have been improved to create an aesthetic forest atmosphere, and the Alishan Highway is relatively undamaged, which in turn has improved the quality of recreation, attracting more than 2.08 million visitors to Alishan this year.

In order to provide a more comfortable recreation experience for visitors, the Chiayi Forestry Administration has completed reconstructions such as the separation of pedestrian and vehicular roads, the improvement of facilities at the Visitor Service Center, and the constructions of the landscape around the Alishan sacred tree, etc. The successful project has a positive force for the peaking tourists numbers in 2014.

Since August 2019, China has imposed a ban on the free flow of Chinese visitors and subsequently increased the number of tour groups, which has impacted the entire tourism industry in Taiwan. The number of visitors decreased by 49.8%, and the number of Chinese visitors also decreased from 1.76 million in 2014 to 420,000, a big drop of 76%. From 2017 to 2019, there will be 1,093,896, 952,418, and 900,1441 national visitors, 594,158, 428,884, and 419,712 Chinese tourists, and 60,292, 63,744, and 65,481 foreign visitors, respectively. The number of foreign visitors has increased by 8.6%.

The Chiayi Forestry Administration Office stated that tourists numbers was affected by the Covid-19 epidemic in 2020. There were only 99,7052 tourists, the lowest in 10 years, compared with the highest number of tourists which is 2.76 million in 2014. Through the outbreak of Covid-19 in May 2021, Alishan National Scenic Area has announced its closure under the tier three Covid restriction.
==Attractions and landmarks==
Fenqihu () is a small town of low wooden buildings built into the mountainside at 1,400 meters, midpoint of the Alishan Forest Railway. It is famous for natural rock formations, mountain streams, forests, and the ruins of a Shinto temple in the vicinity, as well as for its production of high altitude food products such as bamboo shoots and aiyu jelly (). The local box lunches (, &quot;Fenqihu&quot; bento) are known across Taiwan and are sold from stalls at the train station and from Fenqihu Hotel on the Fenqihu Old Street. For many years, Fenqihu was the terminal end of the Alishan Forest Railway line from Chiayi to Alishan, since the railway was heavily damaged by Typhoon Morakot in 2009 and only the Chiayi to Fenqihu portion was reopened in 2014. The rest of the line upslope of Fenqihu reopened in 2024.

<doc id="989848" wikidata="Q261153" url="?curid=989848" title="Muriel Hurtis-Houairi">
<text>Muriel Hurtis-Houairi (born 25 March 1979) is a French track and field athlete. She came to prominence in 2002 when she won the 200 m gold medals at both the European Indoor Championships and the European Athletics Championships. The following year she added the World Indoor title and won a bronze medal at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and a gold in the 4×100 metres relay with France.

Her form faltered over the next few years and she failed to get past the quarter-final stage at the 2004 Olympic Games, although she won Olympic bronze in the relay. She failed to retain her European title at the 2006 European Athletics Championships and was knocked out at the quarter-finals of the 2007 World Championships. She missed out on the 200 m final at the 2008 Summer Olympics by one place. She is the French indoor record holder over 200 m.

==Career==
Her first major success came at the 1998 IAAF World Junior Championships in Annecy, France, where she won the 200 m gold medal. She made her first senior global appearance at age 20 at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics and, after running a personal best of 22.31 seconds in the qualifiers, she finished fifth in the 200 m semi-finals. She ran with the women&#x27;s 4×100 metres relay team and scored a silver medal alongside Sylviane Félix, Frédérique Bangué, and Odiah Sidibé. Hurtis made her Olympic debut the following year at the 2000 Summer Olympics and again she reached the semi-finals, this time finishing in seventh place. Hurtis&#x27;s first global final came at the 2001 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where she finished in fifth. She also helped the French relay team to the World silver medal at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics later that year.

===European and World medals===
The 2002 season marked a significant career progression for Hurtis, beginning with the gold medal at the European Indoor Championships. She ran a 100 metres personal best that summer, recording a time of 10.96 seconds, making her the joint second-fastest French woman over the distance alongside Marie-José Pérec. She became the 200 m European Champion at the 2002 European Athletics Championships, winning in a season&#x27;s best time of 22.43 seconds, and won a second gold with France as part of the 4×100 metres relay team. She closed the year with a fourth place in the 100 m at the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final and by winning the 200 m silver medal at the 2002 IAAF World Cup behind Debbie Ferguson.

She continued her strong form into 2003, recording a French indoor record of 22.49 seconds in the 200 m at the 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships before going on to win the gold medal. At the 2003 World Championships in Athletics she finished in fourth place, but the original winner (Kelli White) was stripped of her medal for using banned substances and Hurtis was upgraded to the bronze medal. Further complicating the situation, Anastasiya Kapachinskaya, who was upgraded to the gold medal was banned six months later for steroid use. Hurtis went on to win her second medal of the competition by winning the relay with Sylviane Félix, Christine Arron and Patricia Girard. At the inaugural 2003 IAAF World Athletics Final, she won the 200 m gold and took fifth in the 100 m.

===Drop in form===
With the removal of the 200 m from the World Indoor programme, Hurtis took part in her first global 60 metres race at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships as was fifth with a season&#x27;s best of 7.17 seconds. In the 2004 Olympics she failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the 200 metres. She won the bronze medal in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.

Hurtis-Houairi represented France at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She competed at the 4x100 metres relay together with Myriam Soumaré, Lina Jacques-Sebastien and Carima Louami. In their first round heat they did not finish and were eliminated due to a mistake with the baton exchange.

A number of injuries to her hamstring interrupted her career in 2009 and 2010, but she returned to the track in May 2010 and ran the 400 metres in 53.65 seconds. Encouraged by her quick performance, given that she had not attempted distance competitively since 1998, she did not rule out a switch to the longer distance. However, she said her main focus remained the 200 m.

<doc id="989851" wikidata="Q2724977" url="?curid=989851" title="Spring Arbor, Michigan">
<text>Spring Arbor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jackson County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population of the CDP was 2,881 at the 2010 census, up from 2,188 at the 2000 census. The CDP is located within Spring Arbor Township.

Spring Arbor is the home of Spring Arbor University, a liberal arts university affiliated with the Free Methodist Church.

==History==
Potawatomi Native Americans resided in present-day Spring Arbor in three known aboriginal villages until their removal to reservations near Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Organized by Territorial Council in 1832, Spring Arbor Township has continued to exist with its present boundaries since 1837. Spring Arbor was first spelled Spring Arbour on all early maps.

During the mid-19th century, a Village of Spring Arbour had been planned along what is now the intersection of Cross and Hammond roads in the southwest portion of the township. The development of such a village began but ended with the departure of the Free Will Baptists&#x27; seminary to what is now Hillsdale College. Remnants of this plot are clearly visible on an aerial view of the area: a portion of Matthews Road continues along a street directed at the intersections of Cross and Hammond. Falling Waters Park can be found at this former establishment with historical information about the area including the Potawatomi village, the founding of the village of Spring Arbor, the 1835 founding of what would eventually become Albion College, and the 1844 founding of the predecessor of both Hillsdale College and Spring Arbor University.

Spring Arbor is in western Jackson County in the center of Spring Arbor Township. State highway M-60 passes through the center of town, leading northeast to Jackson, the county seat, and southwest to Tekonsha.

Spring Arbor is well known for its artesian water springs which form several small lakes, creeks and rivers. Lime Lake County Park is located on in Spring Arbor including a boat launch, a swimming area, playground equipment, and the Falling Waters Trail. The lake was created by the quarrying of marl, a calcium carbonate or lime-rich mud used to make concrete. Divers frequent this lake to view bizarre underwater mountains, pillars, and spires left behind from concrete production.

<text>Streaming television is the digital distribution of television content, such as and films and television series, streamed over the Internet. Standing in contrast to dedicated terrestrial television delivered by over-the-air aerial systems, cable television, and/or satellite television systems, streaming television is provided as over-the-top media (OTT), or as Internet Protocol television (IPTV). In the United States, streaming television has become &quot;the dominant form of TV viewing.&quot;

== History ==

Up until the 1990s, it was not thought possible that a television show could be squeezed into the limited telecommunication bandwidth of a copper telephone cable to provide a streaming service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a digital television signal was (in the mid-1990s perceived to be) around 200Mbit/s, which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper telephone wire. By the year 2000, a television broadcast could be compressed to 2Mbit/s, but most consumers still had little opportunity to obtain greater than 1Mbit/s connection speeds.

Streaming services started as a result of two major technological developments: MPEG (motion-compensated DCT) video compression and asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) data communication.

The first worldwide live-streaming event was a radio live broadcast of a baseball game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees streamed by ESPN SportsZone on September 5, 1995. During the mid-2000s, the streaming media was based on UDP, whereas the basis of the majority of the Internet was HTTP and content delivery networks (CDNs). In 2007, HTTP-based adaptive streaming was introduced by Move Networks. This new technology would be a significant change for the industry. One year later the introduction of HTTP-based adaptive streaming, many companies such as Microsoft and Netflix developed their streaming technology. In 2009, Apple launched HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and Adobe, in 2010, HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS). In addition, HTTP-based adaptive streaming was chosen for important streaming events such as Roland Garros, Wimbledon, Vancouver and London Olympic Games, and many others and on premium on-demand services (Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc.). The increase in streaming services required a new standardization, therefore in 2012, with the contributions of Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, and other companies, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming, known as MPEG-DASH, was published as the new HTTP-based adaptive streaming standard.

The mid-2000s were the beginning of television programs becoming available via the Internet. In November 2003, Angelos Diamantoulakis from Crete pioneered the streaming television service by launching &quot;TVonline&quot;, making it the world&#x27;s first television station to produce and broadcast content exclusively over the internet via web page. The online video platform site YouTube was launched in early 2005, allowing users to share illegally posted television programs. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson&#x27;s role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.

Apple&#x27;s iTunes service also began offering select television programs and series in 2005, available for download after direct payment. A few years later, television networks and other independent services began creating sites where shows and programs could be streamed online. Amazon Prime Video began in the United States as Amazon Unbox in 2006, but did not launch worldwide until 2016. Netflix, a website originally created for DVD rentals and sales, began providing streaming content in 2007. In 2008 Hulu, owned by NBC and Fox, was launched, followed by tv.com in 2009, owned by CBS. The first generation Apple TV was released in 2007 and in 2008 the first generation Roku streaming device was announced. Digital media players also began to become available to the public during this time. These digital media players have continued to be updated and new generations released.

Smart TVs took over the television market after 2010 and continue to partner with new providers to bring streaming video to even more users. As of 2015, smart TVs are the only type of middle to high-end television being produced. Amazon&#x27;s version of a digital media player, Amazon Fire TV, was not offered to the public until 2014.

Access to television programming has evolved from computer and television access to include mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Corresponding apps for mobile devices started to become available via app stores in 2008, but they grew in popularity in the 2010s with the rapid deployment of LTE cellular networks. These apps enable users to stream television content on mobile devices that support them.

In 2008, the International Academy of Web Television, headquartered in Los Angeles, formed in order to organize and support television actors, authors, executives, and producers in web series and streaming television. The organization also administers the selection of winners for the Streamy Awards. In 2009, the Los Angeles Web Series Festival was founded. Several other festivals and award shows have been dedicated solely to web content, including the Indie Series Awards and the Vancouver Web Series Festival. In 2013, in response to the shifting of the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from broadcast to streaming television, a new category for &quot;Fantastic web-only series&quot; in the Daytime Emmy Awards was created. Later that year, Netflix made history by earning the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for a streaming television series, for &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot;, and &quot;House of Cards&quot;, at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Hulu earned the first Emmy win for Outstanding Drama Series, for &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Traditional cable and satellite television providers began to offer services such as Sling TV, owned by Dish Network, which was unveiled in January 2015. DirecTV, another satellite television provider launched their own streaming service, DirecTV Stream, in 2016. Sky launched a similar streaming service in the UK called Now.

In 2013, Video on demand website Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original streaming television at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its series, &quot;House of Cards&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot;, earned nominations that year. On July 13, 2015, cable company Comcast announced an HBO plus broadcast TV package at a price discounted from basic broadband plus basic cable.

In 2017, YouTube launched YouTube TV, a streaming service that allows users to watch live television programs from popular cable or network channels, and record shows to stream anywhere, anytime. , 28% of US adults cite streaming services as their main means for watching television, and 61% of those ages 18 to 29 cite it as their main method. , Netflix is the world&#x27;s largest streaming TV network and also the world&#x27;s largest Internet media and entertainment company with 269 million paid subscribers, and by revenue and market cap. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact in the television streaming business with the lifestyle changes such as staying at home and lockdowns.

==Technology==
The Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies (such as SES, Humax, Philips, and ANT Software) is currently promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital television and multimedia applications with a single-user interface.

BBC iPlayer originally incorporated peer-to-peer streaming, moved towards centralized distribution for their video streaming services. BBC executive Anthony Rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as consumers being unhappy with their own network bandwidth being used for transmitting content to other viewers. Samsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.

===Access control===
Some streaming services incorporate digital rights management. The W3C made the controversial decision to adopt Encrypted Media Extensions due in large part to motivations to provide copy protection for streaming content. Sky Go has software that is provided by Microsoft to prevent content being copied.

Additionally, BBC iPlayer makes use of a parental control system giving users the option to &quot;lock&quot; content, requiring a password to access it. The goal of these systems is to enable parents to keep children from viewing sexually themed, violent, or otherwise age-inappropriate material. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-watershed. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.

===IPTV===

IPTV delivers television content using signals based on the Internet Protocol (IP), through managed private network infrastructure entirely owned by a single telecom or Internet service provider (ISP). This stands in contrast to delivering content over unmanaged public networks - a practice known as over-the-top content delivery. Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a packet-switched network to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system—a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company. In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional circuit switched analog or digital television channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have set-top boxes or other customer-premises equipment that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer&#x27;s needs.

The Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for time shifting television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports video on demand—browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company&#x27;s scheduled broadcasts.

IPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute).

==Streaming quality==

Streaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user&#x27;s screen. Also, Streaming resolution helps to measure the size of the streaming quality of video pixels. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition (1080p) video encoded in AVC is 6000 kbit/s, whereas UHD requires upwards of 16,000 kbit/s.

For users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD/4K video or even SD video, most streaming platforms make use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user&#x27;s bandwidth suddenly drops, the platform will lower its streaming bitrate to compensate. Most modern television streaming platforms offer a wide range of both manual and automatic bitrate settings which are based on initial connection tests during the first few seconds of a video loading, and can be changed on the fly. This is valid for both Live and Catch-up content. Additionally, platforms can also offer content in standards such as HDR or Dolby Vision or at higher framerates which can require additional costs or subscription tiers to access.

==Usage==
Internet television is common in most US households as of the mid-2010s. In a 2013 study by eMarketer, about one in four new televisions being sold is a smart TV. Within the same decade, rapid deployment of LTE cellular network and general availability of smartphones have increased popularity of the streaming services, and the corresponding apps on mobile devices. On August 18, 2022, Nielsen reported that for the first time, streaming viewership has surpassed cable.

Considering the popularity of smart TVs, smartphones, and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the Internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as Netflix&#x27;s &quot;House of Cards&quot;. Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as Hulu Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the BBC utilizes their BBC iPlayer format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that Verizon Fios is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.

Aereo was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo&#x27;s customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013. The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.

Some have noted that as opposed to broadcast television, with demographics of mostly &quot;unspokenly straight&quot; white viewers, cable, and with streaming services, dollars from subscription can &quot;level the playing field,&quot; giving viewers from marginalized communities, and representation of their communities, &quot;equal power.&quot;

The viewing of television content on streaming platforms represented 19% of all television consumption in the United States in 2019, and by the end of 2023 it had become the nation&#x27;s &quot;dominant form of TV viewing&quot;.

In 2023, streaming television represented 38% of global TV viewing with 1.8 billion subscriptions to streaming platforms.

==Market competitors==
Many providers of Internet television services exist—including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as &quot;on-demand&quot; and &quot;catch-up&quot; services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform. Examples include the BBC, which introduced the BBC iPlayer on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its &quot;RadioPlayer&quot; and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (&quot;4 on Demand&quot;) (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee. In the UK, the term catch up TV was most commonly used to refer to these sort of services at the time.

Since 2012, around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged. Investment by Netflix in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.

== Streaming platforms ==
=== Amazon Prime Video ===

Amazon Prime Video was originally launched in the year 2006. Upon its initial release, the popular streaming service was referred to as Amazon Unbox. Amazon Prime Video was created due to the development of Amazon Prime, which is a paid service that includes free shipping of different types of goods. Amazon Prime Video is available in approximately 200 countries around the world. Each year, Amazon invests in the production of films and TV series that are streamed as Amazon originals.

=== Apple TV+ ===

Apple TV+ is a streaming service owned by Apple Inc. Apple TV+ is a streaming subscription platform that launched November 1, 2019. The service offers original content exclusively made by Apple, being seen as Apple Originals. This streaming platform solely releases content that can only be found on Apple TV+, there is no third-party content found on the platform whereas several other streaming services have third-party content. The Apple TV+ name derives from the Apple TV media player that was released in 2007.

=== Disney+ ===

Original films and television series are also distributed on Disney+.

=== Hulu ===

Launched in 2007, Hulu is only available to viewers in the United States because of licensing restrictions. Hulu is one of the only streaming services that provides streaming for current on-air television shows a few days after their original broadcast on cable television, but with limited availability. Hulu originally had both a free and paid plan. The free plan was accessible only via computer and there was a limited amount of content for users, whereas the paid plan could be accessed via computers, mobile devices, and connected televisions. In 2019, The Walt Disney Company became the major owner of Hulu. The platform has bundle deals where customers can subscribe to both Hulu and Disney+.

=== Max ===

Max is a streaming service released by Warner Bros. Discovery. The platform was released on May 27, 2020 in the United States, and within the first five months of launching, had amassed 8 million subscribers across the country. It offers classic Warner Bros. films and self-produced programs, and has won the right to exclusively air Studio Ghibli films in the United States. It is not until 45 days after the theatrical release from 2022 that the release is taking place on the platform and reached 70 million subscribers in December 2021. In September 2022, 92 million households were counted as subscribers, but since this was announced, including subscribers to the HBO channel, it is expected that the actual population of Max alone will be much smaller.

=== Netflix ===

Netflix, founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, is a media streaming and video rental in 1997. Two years later, Netflix was offering the audience the possibility of an online subscription service. Subscribers could select movies and TV shows on Netflix&#x27;s website and receive the chosen titles via DVDs in prepaid return envelopes. In 2007, Netflix&#x27;s subscribers could watch some movies and TV shows online, directly from their homes. In 2010, Netflix launched an only-streaming plan with unlimited streaming services without DVDs. Starting from the United States, the only-streaming plan reached several countries; by 2016 more than 190 countries could use this service. In 2011, Netflix began to negotiate the production of original programming, starting with the series &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

=== Paramount+ ===

Paramount+ is a streaming service that is owned by the Paramount Global. The streaming service was launched on October 28, 2014, and was known as CBS All Access originally. At the time of the release, the platform focused primarily on streaming programs from local CBS stations as well as complete access to all CBS network content. In 2016 the streaming service created original content that could only be found by using the platform. As the network continued to expand with its content, the service decided to rebrand themselves and took the name Paramount+, taking its name from Paramount Pictures film studio. The network since expanded to Latin America, Europe and Australia.

=== Peacock ===

In March 2023, the platform had 22 million paid subscribers.

=== YouTube ===

The domain name of YouTube was bought and activated by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim in the beginning of 2005. YouTube launched later that year as an online video sharing and social media platform. The video platform became popular among the audience thanks to a short video, called Lazy Sunday, uploaded by Saturday Night Live in December 2005. The SNL&#x27;s video was not broadcast on TV, therefore people looked for it on Google by typing &quot;SNL rap video,&quot; &quot;Lazy Sunday SNL,&quot; or &quot;Chronicles of Narnia SNL.&quot; The first result of searches was a link video on YouTube, which was the beginning of sharing videos on YouTube. Because of its popularity, YouTube had some issues caused by its bandwidth expenses. In 2006, Google bought YouTube, and after some months the video platform was the second-largest engine search in the world.

== Binge-watching ==
In the 1990s, the practice of watching entire seasons in a short amount of time emerged with the introduction of the DVD box. Media-marathoning consists of watching at least one season of a TV show in a week or less, watching three or more films from the same series in a week or less, or reading three or more books from the same series in a month or less. The term &quot;binge-watching&quot; arrived with streaming TV, when Netflix launched its first original production, House of Cards, and started marketing this process of watching TV series episode after episode in 2013. COVID-19 gave another connotation to binge-watching, which was considered a negative activity.

==Broadcasting rights==
Broadcasting rights (also called Streaming rights in this case) vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user&#x27;s IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a VPN or proxy server. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4&#x27;s online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as HBO for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.

Some companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America is the use of the &quot;TV Everywhere&quot; system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select Internet service providers, usually cable television companies that pay a retransmission consent or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.

==Profits and costs==
With the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as Netflix and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider with more than 217 million subscribers. The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called &quot;cord cutters&quot;. Cord cutters are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to stream TV series, films and other content via the Internet. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of Online video platform (e.g., YouTube) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.

<text>Elizabeth Helen Blackburn (born 26 November 1948) is an Australian-American Nobel laureate who is the former president of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In 1984, Blackburn co-discovered telomerase, the enzyme that replenishes the telomere, with Carol W. Greider. For this work, she was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak, becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate.

She also worked in medical ethics, and was controversially dismissed from the Bush administration&#x27;s President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics. 170 scientists signed an open letter to the president in her support, maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Helen Blackburn, the second of seven children, was born in Hobart, Tasmania, on 26 November 1948, with both her parents being family physicians. Her family moved to the city of Launceston when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School (later amalgamated with Launceston Church Grammar School) until the age of sixteen.

Upon her family&#x27;s relocation to Melbourne, she attended University High School, and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in 1970 and Master of Science in 1972, both from the University of Melbourne in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her PhD in 1975 from Darwin College at the University of Cambridge, for work she did with Frederick Sanger at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage Phi X 174.

== Career and research==
During her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; and noticed a repeating codon at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size. Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was tandemly repeated, and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;, Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term &quot;telomerase&quot; was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.

=== Telomerase ===
In 1984, Blackburn was a biological researcher and professor of biology and physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, studying the telomere, a structure at the end of chromosomes that protects the chromosome.

Telomerase works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3&#x27; end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double-stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.

On 1 January 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:Carol had done this experiment, and we stood, just in the lab, and I remember sort of standing there, and she had this – we call it a gel. It&#x27;s an autoradiogram because there were trace amounts of radioactivity that were used to develop an image of the separated DNA products of what turned out to be the telomerase enzyme reaction. I remember looking at it and just thinking, &#x27;Ah! This could be very big. This looks just right.&#x27; It had a pattern to it. There was a regularity to it. There was something that was not just sort of garbage there, and that was really kind of coming through, even though we look back at it now, we&#x27;d say, technically, there was this, that, and the other, but it was a pattern shining through, and it just had this sort of sense, &#x27;Ah! There&#x27;s something real here.&#x27; But then, of course, the good scientist has to be very skeptical and immediately say, &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;re going to test this every way around here, and really nail this one way or the other.&#x27; If it&#x27;s going to be true, you have to make sure that it&#x27;s true, because you can get a lot of false leads, especially if you&#x27;re wanting something to work.In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 2999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.

Blackburn co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.

In 2015, Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. &quot;Few scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity&quot;, says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk&#x27;s Board of Trustees, on Blackburn&#x27;s appointment as President of the institute. &quot;Her deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery&quot;.  In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.

=== Nobel Prize ===
For their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular ageing in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signaling. Telomeres are also believed to play an important role in certain types of cancers, including pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancer. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.

===Bioethics===

Blackburn was appointed a member of the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush administration. Her Council terms were terminated by White House directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration&#x27;s position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.

Scientists and ethicists at the time even went as far as to say that Blackburn&#x27;s removal was in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which &quot;requires balance on such advisory bodies&quot;

&quot;There is a growing sense that scientific research—which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth—is being manipulated for political ends&quot;, wrote Blackburn. &quot;There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.&quot;

Blackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.

=== Current research ===
In recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on mindfulness meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary &quot;Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times&quot;. She also featured in the 2012 Emmy award-winning science documentary, &#x27;Decoding Immortality&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Immortal&#x27;) by Genepool Productions. Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.

At the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby affecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.

== Publications ==
Blackburn&#x27;s first book &quot;The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer&quot; (2017) was co-authored with health psychologist Dr. Elissa S. Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on ageing reversal and care for one&#x27;s telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: ageing of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the ageing mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.

Blackburn states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was &quot;significantly shorter&quot; compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, &quot;There&#x27;s an obvious stressor ... we are intensely social beings.&quot; She suggests positivity in daily life increases health. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, and tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that telomere length can be maintained, leading to a decrease in cell aging. Blackburn also tells readers to be wary of clinical pills that proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.

== Personal life ==
While working at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Sedat had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. &quot;Thus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall’s lab at Yale.&quot; They moved to New Haven and were married soon after.

Blackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and San Francisco with her husband, and has a son, born in 1986. She serves as a mentor and advocate for scientific research and policy.

<text>The Hall of Mirrors () is a grand Baroque style gallery and one of the most emblematic rooms in the royal Palace of Versailles near Paris, France. The grandiose ensemble of the hall and its adjoining salons was intended to illustrate the power of the absolutist monarch Louis XIV. Located on the first floor (&quot;piano nobile&quot;) of the palace&#x27;s central body, it faces west towards the palace gardens. The Hall of Mirrors has been the scene of events of great historic significance, including the Proclamation of the German Empire and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

== Cultural and historical background ==

=== Construction ===

In 1623, King Louis XIII ordered the construction of a modest two-story hunting lodge at Versailles, which he soon enlarged to a château from 1631 to 1634. His son Louis XIV declared the site his future permanent residence in 1661 and ordered the transformation into an extensive residence in several stages and on a grandiose scale. The palace was to provide ideal settings for rest and retreat but it also had to attain a new quality of representation as the future seat of Europe&#x27;s greatest absolutist royal court and government of supreme authority, residence of choice for the aristocratic society and arena for elaborate state festivals and ceremonies, Europe&#x27;s centre of culture, art and entertainment. During the early expansion phase Louis Le Vau added the Forecourt (1662) and the &quot;Le Vau Envelope&quot; (1668 to 1670), encased the old château and added two new wings in the north and south. The new wings towered over the original western building by the garden. The space in between was a terrace supported by arcades. The buildings of the &quot;Le Vau Envelope&quot; included the king&#x27;s apartments in the north and the queen&#x27;s apartments in the south.

The Hall of Mirrors was built during the third building stage between 1678 and 1684 and was to replace a large terrace and several smaller salons facing the gardens. The terrace was originally situated directly outside of the King&#x27;s and the Queen&#x27;s apartments. The terrace was considered to be a rather misplaced architectural element and exposed to the elements, reducing its utility. Eventually it was decided to demolish it and architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart was tasked with the design development and the construction of the Mirror Hall Gallery and artist Charles Le Brun received the honor to create the interior decorative apparatus.

The garden façade of the Corps de logis was built in a straight front and essentially received its current appearance. The Hall of Mirrors is flanked at the far ends by the Salon of War () in the north and the Salon of Peace () in the south, respectively. The Hall of Mirrors connects to the two salons, which were assigned to and incorporated into the king&#x27;s apartments in the north and the queen&#x27;s apartments in the south. Both salons are accessible via the Hall of Mirrors through wide opening passageways. The hall and the two salons were identically furnished and decorated and form a stylistic and functional unit. The exterior walls of the salons date from the time of Le Vau&#x27;s encasings of the old château and were given their current appearance after the installation of the Hall of Mirrors by Hardouin-Mansart.

The Hall of Mirrors is—besides the Palace Chapel, completed in the early 18th century, the Court Opera and the —one of the largest rooms in the palace. It is long and deep. With its height of it reaches to the Attic floor of the Corps de Logis. The square windows on the upper floor, which can be seen from the outside, only serve aesthetic purposes, as there are no rooms inside. The installation of any kind of fireplaces was never contemplated as the Hall of Mirrors was too large to effectively be heated.

==Arts and decoration==
The Hall of Mirrors&#x27; 17 windows open in the direction of the park. On the opposite inside wall of the hall are 17 equally large mirrors, that are composed of more than 350 individual mirror surfaces. On the one hand, the mirrors had an aesthetic function, as the mirror image of the garden depicted the exterior of the castle into the interior of the building and reflected the candlelight in the evening. On the other hand, the mirrors also conveyed the king&#x27;s wealth and the efficiency of the French economy in a subtle way. Mirror glass was an expensive luxury product in the 17th century and could only be produced with great effort. The manufacture of the mirror surfaces was the first major order for the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs, a glass factory founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the later Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, with which the Venetian monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors in Europe was broken.

Much of the original solid silver furniture of the Hall of Mirrors, famous at the time, was soon lost, particularly the silver Guéridons (tables), which were melted down and coined by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg. Today&#x27;s furniture was manufactured during the 19th century after most of the original furnishings were lost during the French Revolution.

=== Sculptures ===

The gilded bronze capitals of the Rouge de Rance marble pilasters are decorated with the Fleur-de-lis and Gallic roosters. The gilded bronze trophies, that adorn the green marble Pier glasses, were manufactured by goldsmith Pierre Ladoyreau.

The marble and porphyry busts of eight Roman emperors are accompanied by sculptures of Greek and Roman deities and Muses, such as Bacchus, Venus (Venus of Arles), Modesty, Hermes, Urania, Nemesis and Diana (Diana of Versailles). The latter, moved to the Louvre in 1798, was replaced by a Diana sculpted by René Frémin for the gardens of the Château de Marly until the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors during 2004 to 2007, which in turn was replaced by a copy of the original Diana.

===Ceiling===
The ceiling combines with the mirrors and the light from the western windows to confer on the room its unique character. Nine large and numerous smaller paintings, most of them on canvas using marouflage and the rest directly painted on masonry, are dedicated to the idolization Louis XIV as the Sun King and to the successes of the first two decades of his personal rule (starting in 1661). Charles Le Brun, &quot;the greatest French artist of all time&quot; according to King Louis XIV, directed the ceiling paintings. The central scene is titled &quot;The King rules by Himself&quot;, highlighting Louis&#x27;s claim to absolute power and his adversarial stance to rival European powers, the main three of which (the Holy Roman Empire, the United Provinces, and Spain) are depicted on the opposite side of the same panel. The themes of the larger panels center on the Franco-Dutch War of 1672–1678, while the other scenes include episodes of the prior War of Devolution of 1667–1668 and domestic achievements.

According to a contemporary anecdote, the decoration of the eastern wall with mirrors was a ploy by architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart to prevent Le Brun from having even more opportunities to impress Louis with his work.

The narrative sequence of the central scenes starts with the formation of the German (Imperial)-Spanish-Dutch alliance in 1672 on the Northern end, and ends with the unraveling of that alliance with the Dutch acceptance of a separate peace with France in 1678. The full list is a compendium of key propaganda themes of the early 1680s, with titles provided by poets Boileau and Racine in their capacity as the regime&#x27;s official historians:

# &quot;Alliance of Germany and Spain with Holland, 1672&quot;
# &quot;Holland rescued from the bishop of Munster, 1665&quot;
# &quot;Relief of the people during the , 1662&quot;
# &quot;Reparation of the Corsican Guard&#x27;s affront in Rome, 1664&quot;
# &quot;The crossing of the Rhine in front of the enemy, 1672&quot;
# &quot;The King seizes Maastricht in thirteen days, 1673&quot;
# &quot;Defeat of the Turks in Hungary by the King&#x27;s troops, 1664&quot;
# &quot;The folly of duelling abolished, 1662&quot;
# &quot;The precedence of France acknowledged by Spain, 1662&quot;
# &quot;The King gives his orders to simultaneously attack four of Holland&#x27;s best-defended strongholds, 1672&quot;
# &quot;The King ramps up military preparations on land and sea, 1672&quot;
# &quot;The restoration of France&#x27;s naval power, 1663&quot;
# &quot;War against Spain for the Queen&#x27;s rights, 1667&quot;
# &quot;The reformation of the justice system, 1667&quot;
# &quot;The King rules by Himself, 1661&quot;
# &quot;The pomp of France&#x27;s neighboring powers&quot;
# &quot;Order restored to the kingdom&#x27;s finances, 1662&quot;
# &quot;The peace concluded in Aix-la-Chapelle, 1668&quot;
# &quot;Protection awarded to the fine arts, 1663&quot;
# &quot;Franche-Comté conquered once again, 1674&quot;
# &quot;Resolution to undertake war against Holland, 1671&quot;
# &quot;Establishment of the royal institution of Les Invalides, 1674&quot;
# &quot;Acquisition of Dunkirk, 1662&quot;
# &quot;Embassies sent from the confines of the Earth&quot;
# &quot;Takeover of the city and citadel of Ghent in six days, 1678&quot;
# &quot;Spanish actions countered by the takeover of Ghent&quot;
# &quot;, 1663&quot;
# &quot;, 1665&quot;
# &quot;The junction of the two seas, 1667&quot;
# &quot;Holland accepts peace and leaves the alliance with Germany and Spain, 1678&quot;

Many of the same themes would be illustrated again a few years later, albeit with a different iconography, in the Louis XIV Victory Monument on Place des Victoires in the center of Paris.

== Functions ==
During the 17th century, the hall&#x27;s main purpose was to serve as a kind of covered promenade for Louis XIV&#x27;s visit to the chapel. He entered the gallery at least once a day and from 1701, the King&#x27;s bedroom lay behind the middle wall of the gallery. Courtiers assembled to meet the King and members of the royal family and might make a particular request by intoning: &quot;Sire, Marly?&quot;. This was the manner in which nobles were able to obtain a much sought-after invitation to one of the king&#x27;s house parties at the Château de Marly, a villa Louis XIV had built north of Versailles on the route to Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

Its central location and size predestined the Hall of Mirrors as a place for court festivities such as the wedding of the Louis, Duke of Burgundy with Marie Adélaïde of Savoy, the wedding of Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain in 1645 and the wedding of the Dauphin, future king Louis XVI, and Marie Antoinette in 1770. In the successive reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, the Hall of Mirrors continued to serve for family and court functions. Embassies, births, and marriages were held in this room. The most celebrated event of the 18th century on 25 February 1745 was the celebrated Yew Tree Ball. It was during this costume ball that Louis XV, who was dressed as a yew tree, met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson d&#x27;Étiolles, who was costumed as Diana, goddess of the hunt. Jeanne-Antoinette, who became Louis XV&#x27;s mistress, is better known to history as the Marquise de Pompadour.

Foreign audiences were granted, including that of the Doge of Genoa in 1685 and the embassy of Sultan Mahmud I of the Ottoman Empire in 1742. Of all the events that transpired in this room during the reign of Louis XIV, the Siamese Embassy of 1685–1686 has been cited as the most opulent. At this time, the Hall of Mirrors and the &quot;grand appartements&quot; were still decorated with the original silver furniture. In its heyday, over 3,000 candles were used to light the Hall of Mirrors. In February 1715, Louis XIV held his last embassy in the hall when he received Mohammad Reza Beg, ambassador of the Shah of Persia, Sultan Husayn.

The Second German Empire was established in the Hall of Mirrors on 18 January 1871, after the German siege of Paris at the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War. In a ceremony led by Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian king, William I, the assembled German princes and lords declared William I the German emperor in the Hall of Mirrors. Versailles was chosen because it was the headquarters of the united German armies; the Hall of Mirrors was chosen specifically because its ceiling paintings glorified the conquest of German territories by France. The French nation regarded this ceremony as deeply humiliating. The event greatly contributed to the further accretion of the Franco-German enmity. A few decades later French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau consciously chose the Hall of Mirrors as the site to sign the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919, that officially ended World War I. Thus, the Entente dismantled the German Empire in the very room where it had been proclaimed.

The Hall of Mirrors remains reserved for official ceremonies of the French Republic. Notable events during the 20th century were the reception of U.S. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife by Charles De Gaulle, the reception of the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in 1974 or the invitation of representatives of the Group of Seven summit by President François Mitterrand from 4 to 6 June 1982.

<text>The Congridae are the family of conger and [[garden eel]]s. Congers are valuable and often large food fishes, while garden eels live in colonies, all protruding from the sea floor after the manner of plants in a garden (thus the name). The family includes over 220 species in 32 genera.

The European conger, &quot;Conger conger&quot;, is the largest of the family and of the Anguilliformes order that includes it; it has been recorded at up to in length and weighing .

Congrids are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate seas around the world. Clear distinguishing features among congrids are few; they all lack scales, and most possess pectoral fins. They feed on crustaceans and small fish.

<doc id="989881" wikidata="Q659707" url="?curid=989881" title="Tchoukball">
<text>Tchoukball ( ) is an indoor team sport, played by teams of 7 players. It was developed in Switzerland in the 1970s, and is most popular in Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan, but has become an international sport with national federations in over 60 countries. It is governed by the International Tchoukball Federation (FITB), which was founded in 1971. 

It is usually played with a ball on an indoor court with a small elastic rebounder on each end. Teams score by bouncing the ball against the rebounder and getting it to bounce on the floor of the court without being intercepted by the defending team. The sport was designed to limit injuries, and physical contact between players is prohibited. 

==History==
Tchoukball was created in Switzerland by Hermann Brandt, who was concerned by the numerous serious injuries among athletes resulting from sports prone to aggression and physical contact. He believed that sports should be not only for champions, but also contribute to the creation of a better and more humane society. He designed tchoukball to contain elements of handball (it is played with hands, and the balls used are similar), volleyball (as the defending team must prevent the ball from falling) and squash (since there is a rebound).

==Etymology==
The name of tchoukball (pronounced as &quot;choukball&quot;, with a silent &quot;t&quot;) comes from the onomatopoeic &quot;tchouk&quot; sound the ball makes when it bounces off a frame.

==Basic rules==
Teams may comprise 12 players, however only 7 may be on the court at any one time. 

Physical contact between players is prohibited, and defenders may not attempt to intercept the attacking team&#x27;s passes. Players may take at most three steps with the ball, and hold the ball for at most three seconds. Teams may not pass the ball more than three times before shooting at the rebounder.

Court

* The court size that is generally used is 27 m × 16 m. However, there are variations to this such as in beach tchoukball where a court size of 21 m × 12 m is used.
* One rebounder is placed at each end of the field of play, one square meter in area.
* In front of each rebounder, a D-shaped semi-circle measuring 3 m in radius is drawn; this defines the limits of a &#x27;forbidden zone&#x27; where defenders cannot stand.
* The lines around zones are considered part of the zone: the line marking the semicircle forbidden zone is considered part of the forbidden zone, and the line around the entire court is considered a part of the court.

Ball

Depending on the category of players (Men, Women, Youth), different sizes of balls are used. These range from a circumference of 54 – 60 cm and weights from 325 – 475 grams.

Scoring

Two teams of 7 players each (men or women) compete to score points with the team with the most points at the end winning the game. 
When a team gains a point, control of the ball is transferred to the other team.
* In tchoukball either team can score at either end of the court.
* A point is scored when the ball rebounds after hitting either of the 2 rebounders and touches the ground outside the forbidden zone, any part of the defending player&#x27;s body below the knees, or touches the defending player while he is still in the forbidden zone.
* A point is given to the non-attacking team when the attacking team shoots and misses the rebounder, or the ball rebounds outside the playing area (either out of the court or in the forbidden zone).
* If a shot is caught by the defending team, the defending team can proceed to attack immediately.
==Positions==
Each team comprises the following positions:
* 2 Right Shooters or Right Wings
* 2 Left Shooters or Left Wings
* 2 or 3 defenders or Forward Pivot
* 1 Centre (or none if 3 defenders are used) or Centre Pivot
Each side of the court comprises a left shooter, right shooter and 1 or 2 defenders, while the centre usually stays near the middle of the court if this formation is used. The shooters are generally in charge of shooting although in some cases the defender can also take the shot. The defenders are in charge of coordinating the first line of defence while the centre pivot takes charge of the second line of defence.
However other formations include not using a centre pivot, the team would bypass the centre and throw full length court passes directly to the shooters/inners. This gives an extra first line defender or a dedicated second line defender.

==Playing the game==
Players with the ball can take a maximum of 3 steps, and hold the ball for a maximum of 3 seconds. Bouncing the ball is not allowed.

When a pass is not completed (the ball touches the ground or goes out of bounds), the other team gets possession.

The defending team cannot obstruct the attacking one during passing.

For the scoring team, stepping into the forbidden zone with the ball is not allowed. The ball must be released before the player lands in the forbidden zone.

In addition to classic indoor tchoukball, there is also beach tchoukball and wheelchair tchoukball, with slightly different rules. There are also Youth and University leagues, separate from the open league.

==International Tchoukball Federation (FITB)==
The FITB, founded in 1971, is based in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2021, it includes 50 member associations and 22 (15+7) countries with a designated FITB Representative. It supports and advises national associations and individuals willing to spread tchoukball in new areas. For instance, tchoukball was recently integrated in the school program of some regions of Senegal. The FITB was a demonstration sport in the 2009 World Games, which took place in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

At the world championship level, tchoukball has been dominated by Taiwanese teams since 1980. Their only losses since then were in 2004 when they were defeated by Switzerland in the men&#x27;s final, and in 2023, when Italy defeated them in the women&#x27;s semi-final.

<text>Sharon Monsky (October 23, 1953 – May 11, 2002) was an American health activist who founded the Scleroderma Research Foundation.

==Early life==
Monsky was born in Omaha, Nebraska on October 23, 1953. She was a competitive figure skater as a teenager.

Monsky received a BA in Economics at Pitzer College, where she also met her future husband Mark Scher. She received her MBA from Stanford University in 1980, while living in San Francisco and working on the Pacific Stock Exchange.

==Scleroderma Research Foundation==
In 1982, while working as a management consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co. Inc., Monsky was diagnosed with scleroderma and was told she had only two years to live. The rare disease hardens the skin and internal organs of young women of child-bearing age causing disfigurement, and is potentially fatal.

In reaction to the lack of awareness of the disease in the medical community, she went on to found the Scleroderma Research Foundation in 1987, an organization dedicated to finding a cure. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Monsky&#x27;s activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.&quot; Ms. Monsky applied her business expertise to successful fund-raising efforts. For example, she organized an annual fund-raiser which in 1992 combined top comedians such as Bob Saget plus fine cuisine which drew 420 people and netted donations of $125,000.

Monsky&#x27;s friend actress Dana Delany said &quot;Sharon&#x27;s work literally convinced researchers that there was hope in finding a cure ... Before research can begin researchers have to be convinced there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Now we know it&#x27;s a solvable problem held back only by research resources.&quot; In 1996, Monsky appeared in the ABC TV movie &quot;For Hope&quot; alongside Delany. Reflecting on her work, Monsky has stated, &quot;I&#x27;m in the business of finding a cure for scleroderma...and the best thing of all is that I&#x27;m in the business to go out of business.&quot;

After living 18 years beyond the original prognosis, Monsky died on May 11, 2002, at age 48, due to complications from the disease.

<doc id="989897" wikidata="Q2275288" url="?curid=989897" title="Psychometry (paranormal)">
<text>In parapsychology, psychometry (from Greek: ψυχή, &quot;psukhē&quot;, &quot;spirit, soul&quot; and μέτρον, &quot;metron&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;), also known as token-object reading, or psychoscopy, is a form of extrasensory perception characterized by the claimed ability to glean accurate knowledge of an object&#x27;s history by making physical contact with that object. Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that transfers knowledge regarding that object&#x27;s history.

There is no evidence that psychometry exists, and the concept has been widely criticized.

== History ==
Joseph Rodes Buchanan coined the word &quot;psychometry&quot; (measuring the soul) in 1842. Buchanan developed the idea that all things give off an emanation.

&quot;The Past is entombed in the Present!&quot; The world is its own enduring monument; and that which is true of its physical, is likewise true of its mental career. The discoveries of Psychometry will enable us to explore the history of man, as those of geology enable us to explore the history of the earth. There are mental fossils for psychologists as well as mineral fossils for the geologists; and I believe that hereafter the psychologist and the geologist will go hand in hand — the one portraying the earth, its animals and its vegetation, while the other portrays the human beings who have roamed over its surface in the shadows, and the darkness of primeval barbarism! Aye, the mental telescope is now discovered which may pierce the depths of the past and bring us in full view of the grand and tragic passages of ancient history!

Buchanan asserted that his particular psychism would supersede empiric science. He wrote a comprehensive treatise, &quot;Manual of Psychometry: the Dawn of a New Civilization&quot; (1885), detailing how the direct knowledge of psychometry would be applied to and affect the many various branches of science.

The thermometer measures caloric (&quot;thermo&quot; temperature). The barometer measures the weight (&quot;baro&quot;, weight) of the atmosphere; the electrometer measures electric conditions; the psychometer measures the soul (&quot;psyche&quot;). In the case of Psychometry, however, the measuring assumes a new character, as the object measured and the measuring instrument are the same psychic element, and its measuring power is not limited to the psychic as it was developed in the first experiments, but has appeared by successive investigation to manifest a wider and wider area of power, until it became apparent that this psychic capacity was really the measure of all things in the Universe.

Buchanan continued to promote psychometry throughout his life and his followers believed that it would revolutionize science in a comprehensive way as &quot;the dawn of a new civilization&quot;. Buchanan&#x27;s work on psychometry was continued by the geologist William Denton (1823–1883). In 1863, Denton published a book on the subject &quot;The Soul of Things&quot;. Their work was criticized by Joseph Jastrow as based on delusion and wishful thinking.

Others, such as Stephen Pearl Andrews, who promoted Psychometry along with his own new science of Universology, built upon Buchanan&#x27;s ideas. As a lecturer, Andrews asserted that such inquiries, as paraphrased by an 1878 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;demonstrated that the sympathy between the mind and body is an exact science&quot;.

In the later nineteenth century demonstrations of psychometry became a popular part of stage acts and séances, with participants providing a personal object for &quot;reading&quot; by a medium or psychic. It is also commonly offered at psychic fairs as a type of psychic reading.

==Scientific reception==
Skeptics explain alleged successes of psychometry by cold reading and confirmation bias.
Skeptic Robert Todd Carroll describes psychometry as a pseudoscience.

The majority of police departments polled do not use psychics and do not consider them credible or useful on cases. Proponents of psychometry have argued that psychic detectives have been used by law enforcement agencies on specific cases. However, psychologist Leonard Zusne has noted that &quot;enquiries with police officials [...] reveal that the involvement of psychics has not been very helpful, and that second-hand reports of it are often in gross error.&quot;

<doc id="989904" wikidata="Q5160457" url="?curid=989904" title="Conger (syndicate)">
<text>The conger was a system common in bookselling in 18th- and early 19th-century England, for financing the printing of a book. The term referred to a syndicate of booksellers, mostly in London, who bought shares to finance the book&#x27;s printing. Each member agreed to take so many copies for sale themselves, and the final profit was split in proportion to the members&#x27; initial financial input. Their names all appeared on the title pages as co-publishers, though one of the major publishing houses usually took the lead in setting the deal up.

Prior to the Statute of Anne, the Conger (often seen capitalized) also had an effect on copyright. After the printing became common, publishers took the position that having purchased a work from an author, the right to control its publication continued permanently. Courts supported the claim via precedent, until the Statute was passed early in the 18th century, after which it was law that literary works went into the public domain after a fixed time set by statute. 

This system seems to have been mostly used in the financing of major projects – for example, multi-volume works such as encyclopedias. Shares were often subdivided and re-sold, so the actual balance of ownership became very convoluted.

The Conger system was also, in effect, a wholesaling system which controlled the distribution of popular books. The Conger syndicate met regularly from the 1690s, holding private auctions at which books could be bought wholesale for resale either to the public or to regional booksellers. The system handled over 170,000 books, to the value of nearly £37,000, between 1695 and 1705.</text><links>

<doc id="989905" wikidata="Q11479" url="?curid=989905" title="Kulon Progo Regency">
<text>Kulon Progo Regency (, , ) is one of the four regencies within the Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia. It is located on the island of Java, with a coastline on the south of that island. The regency&#x27;s name stems from the fact that it is situated to the west (in Javanese &quot;kulon&quot;) of the Progo River. The capital is Wates. The greatest part of the population of the regency work as farmers. Kulon Progo Regency is surrounded by the Menoreh Hills. The area of the regency is 586.28 km2, and the population was 388,755 at the 2010 census and 436,395 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 443,053 - comprising 219,451 males and 223,602 females.

==History==
In 1674, Keraton Mataram, Yogyakarta was attacked by Trunojoyo who received assistance from Macassar, resulting in damage to the palace; the king Amangkurat I had to flee and asked the Netherlands for help, till he died in Tegal during flight.

To anticipate attacks from Trunojoyo&#x27;s followers, in 1677 the palace of Mataram led by Amangkurat II as the crown prince of Amangkurat I asked for the regent Ponorogo to obtain the palace protection by bala Warok famous skilled in war and asked for help from the Dutch colonial to capture Trunojoyo. 
After Mataram palace was guarded by Warok of Ponorogo, Tronojoyo had difficulties to penetrate the palace and was arrested and finally sentenced to death in 1679.

The Warok who managed to protect the palace got the prize a place to stay in the west of Mataram palace to facilitate the palace defence in case of an attack against the palace. The place was named Kulon Ponorogo and is now known as Kulon Progo which means Keraton Mataram western Ponorogo.

The area which currently includes the regency of Kulon Progo was - until the end of Dutch colonial rule - the territory of two regencies, namely the former Kulon Progo (which was a regency of the Ngayogyakarta Sultanate) and Adikarto (which was a regency of the Pakualaman Duchy). Both regencies were merged into Kulon Progo administration on 15 October 1951.

==Administrative districts==
Kulon Progo Regency is divided into twelve districts (&quot;kapanewon&quot;), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages (classed as &quot;kalurahan&quot;) in each district, and its post code.

==Forestry==
Some local development efforts, carried on with the support of local cooperatives, work towards reafforestation activities. Trees being planted in the regency for both commercial and social reasons include &quot;Jati&quot; (Teak or &quot;Tecnona grandis&quot;), Mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;), Albasia (&quot;Albizia&quot;), and &quot;sono keliling (Blackwood or Rosewoon, &quot;Dalbergia latifolia&quot;).

==Yogyakarta International Airport==

The central Indonesian government has indicated that a new airport for the Yogyakarta Special Region will be located in the Kulon Progo Regency. The plan is to build an airport with a 3,250 metre runway with 45 meters width and dual linear terminals to serve as an international gateway. The initial plan is to provide facilities to serve up to 10 million passengers per year for 28 aircraft together. Later expansions might accommodate up to 20 million passengers per year in phase-3. Around 637 hectares of land is being set aside for the project. Of this, 40% is classified as &quot;Paku Alam (Sultan)&quot; land while the rest belongs to local communities. The location is in Temon District between Congot Beach and Glagah Beach (which covers Palihan village, Sindutan village, Jangkaran village and Glagah village). In August 2013, 75 percent of land has been occupied.

An airport train has been planned to serve Yogyakarta and the airport. The rail use existing rail plus 4 kilometers new rail from Kedundang Station to Temon Airport. Due to new rail is only short, so the train hopefully will be ready when the airport is ready to operate.

Local residents of the Kulon Regency have been resisting the plans for the new airport. They claim there are several environmental issues with the proposed site as well as issues of safety, due to the area being at high risk for tsunamis and other natural disasters. There is also concern that the local residents who currently make their living by farming the area would be displaced.

<doc id="989933" wikidata="Q945740" url="?curid=989933" title="Some Girls">
<text>Some Girls is the fourteenth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 9 June 1978 by Rolling Stones Records. It was recorded in sessions held from October 1977 to February 1978 at Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris and produced by the band&#x27;s chief songwriterslead vocalist Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards (credited as the Glimmer Twins)with Chris Kimsey engineering the recording.

By 1976, the Rolling Stones&#x27; popularity was in decline as the music industry was dominated by disco and newer rock bands. In addition, the punk rock movement was an emerging cultural force in the UK. Due to legal troubles surrounding Richards, Jagger is generally regarded as the principal creative force behind &quot;Some Girls&quot;. With him drawing influence from dance music, most notably disco, the recording sessions were highly productive, resulting in numerous outtakes that appeared on subsequent albums.

It was the first album to feature guitarist Ronnie Wood as a full-time member; Wood had contributed to some tracks on the band&#x27;s prior two albums, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; (1974) and &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1976). With a stable lineup in place for the first time in several years, the album marked a return to basics for the Rolling Stones and did not feature many guest musicians, unlike many of their prior albums. Notable contributions to the album, however, come from blues harmonica player Sugar Blue on &quot;Miss You&quot; and the title track.

Despite controversy surrounding its cover artwork and lyrical content, &quot;Some Girls&quot; was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. It became the band&#x27;s top-selling album in the United States, having been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling six million copies by 2000 in the country. Several hit singles emerged from the album, which became rock radio staples for decades, including &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; (US number eight), &quot;Shattered&quot; (US number 31), &quot;Respectable&quot; (UK number 23), highlighted by &quot;Miss You&quot;, which reached number one in the United States and number three in the UK.

Rebounding from the relative critical disappointment of &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Some Girls&quot; was a critical success, with many reviewers calling it a classic return to form for the band and their best album since &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972). It became the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy Award in the Album of the Year category. Retrospectively, it has continued to receive acclaim, with many commending the band&#x27;s ability to blend contemporary music trends with their older signature style. &quot;Some Girls&quot; is considered one of the band&#x27;s finest records, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has included it in their lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Background ==
By 1976, the Rolling Stones&#x27; popularity was in decline as the charts were dominated by disco and newer bands such as Aerosmith and Kiss. In the UK, the punk rock movement was a rising force and made most artists connected with the 1960s era seem obsolete. The group had also failed to produce a critically acclaimed album since 1972&#x27;s &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;

On 7 February 1977, the Stones were scheduled to play El Mocambo in Toronto, Ontario; however, Keith Richards and his partner Anita Pallenberg were arrested for possession of heroin and suspected of drug trafficking. With the help of Jimmy Carter, who obtained visas, the pair was permitted to leave Canada so that Richards could undergo detoxification in the United States. During this time, Richards obtained a conditional visa for France and met the rest of the Stones in Paris to begin work on what became &quot;Some Girls&quot;. Facing the possibility of Richards receiving a seven-year sentence in Canada, Jagger and Richards both believed that the Stones might be forced to disband and that &quot;Some Girls&quot; could be the last album. During Richards&#x27; trial, the courtroom was filled with Stones fans and it became clear to reporters present that he would not be &quot;sent to jail.&quot; Overseeing the trial, Judge Lloyd Graburn stated that while &quot;heroin addicts should go to prison if they commit theft to support their habit, or make no effort to kick the habit...Richards was different. He made so much money as a rock star, he didn&#x27;t need to steal, and his effort to remove himself from the drug culture was an example to others.&quot; Graburn issued Richards a one-year probation and ordered that he play a benefit concert for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind within six months; Graburn chose this sentencing option after speaking with a blind fan whom Richards had befriended years earlier and ensured her safe passage to and from concerts. Tickets were provided for free to the blind and other tickets were made available for sighted fans at regular price.

Later in February 1977, the Stones renewed their contract with Atlantic Records for US distribution, and out of patriotic feelings originating from this being the year of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, signed with EMI for distribution to the rest of the world.

==Writing and recording==
Mick Jagger is generally regarded as the principal creative force behind &quot;Some Girls&quot;. Keith Richards was in legal trouble for much of 1977, which resulted in the band being inactive on the touring circuit during that year, except for two shows in Canada during the spring for the live album &quot;Love You Live&quot;. Jagger solely wrote &quot;Miss You&quot;, as well as &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;. In addition to punk, Jagger claims to have been influenced by dance music, most notably disco, during the recording of &quot;Some Girls&quot;, and cites New York City as a major inspiration for the album, an explanation for his lyrical preoccupation with the city throughout.

At least as important for the band&#x27;s reinvigoration was the addition of Ronnie Wood to the lineup, as &quot;Some Girls&quot; was the first album recorded with him as a full member. Unlike the guitar style of Mick Taylor, Wood&#x27;s guitar playing style meshed with that of Richards, and slide guitar playing became one of the band&#x27;s hallmarks. His unconventional uses of the instrument featured prominently on &quot;Some Girls&quot; and he contributed to the writing process. Wood later recalled that working with the Stones was a different experience from with his former band the Faces, stating, &quot;I had never worked so intensely before on a project.&quot; In addition, Jagger, who had learned to play guitar over the previous decade, contributed a third guitar part to many songs. This gave songs such as &quot;Respectable&quot; a three-guitar lineup.

For the first time since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, the core bandnow Jagger, Richards, Wood, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wymanwere the main musicians on a Rolling Stones album, with few extra contributors. Ian McLagan, Wood&#x27;s bandmate from the Faces, played keyboards, and harmonica player Sugar Blue contributed to several songs, in addition to saxophonist Mel Collins and Simon Kirke, who played percussion. The band decided not to use studio musicians, including Billy Preston and Nicky Hopkins, as Richards felt that while these musicians were &quot;technically superior&quot; they ultimately led the band into experimental territory and away from their basic sound. Jagger&#x27;s guitar contributions caused the band&#x27;s road manager, Ian Stewart, to be absent from many of the sessions, as he felt piano would be superfluous, making this a rare Rolling Stones album on which he did not appear.

Rehearsals for &quot;Some Girls&quot; began in October 1977 and lasted a month before recording commenced in November, breaking before Christmas and starting up again after New Year&#x27;s before finishing in March 1978. Under their new British recording contract with EMI (remaining with Warner Music Group in North America only), they were able to record at EMI&#x27;s Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris, a venue at which they would record frequently for the next several years. Three studios were made available to the bandtwo large studios featuring high ceilings and 24-track recording capabilities and a more modest studio with 16-track capabilities. The band opted to use the latter as a rehearsal space, and despite Jagger wanting to move to the larger studios, opted to remain in the smaller one and use it for recording. According to Richards, songs were written on a day-by-day basis. The band ended up recording about 50 new songs, several of which turned up in altered forms on &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tattoo You&quot; (1981). Chris Kimsey was the engineer for the sessions. Kimsey&#x27;s direct method of recording, together with the entrance of the then state-of-the-art Mesa/Boogie Mark I amplifiers instead of the Ampeg SVT line of amps, yielded a bright, direct, and aggressive guitar sound.

==Packaging and artwork==
The album cover for &quot;Some Girls&quot; was a collaborative effort involving the design by Peter Corriston and illustrations by Hubert Kretzschmar. Kretzschmar recalled the album originally had the working title &quot;Lies&quot;. The two would design the band&#x27;s next three album covers. An elaborate die-cut design, with the colours on the sleeves varying in different markets, it featured the Rolling Stones&#x27; faces alongside those of select female celebrities inserted into a copy of an old Valmor Products Corporation advertisement. The first printing of the album was censored as The Rolling Stone lawyers could not get permission to use those actors&#x27; images. The cover design was challenged legally when Lucille Ball, Farrah Fawcett, Liza Minnelli (representing her mother Judy Garland), Raquel Welch, and the estate of Marilyn Monroe threatened to sue for the use of their likenesses without permission. Similarly, Valmor did take legal action and were given a monetary award for the use of their design.

The album was quickly reissued with a redesigned cover that removed all the celebrities, whether they had complained or not. The celebrity images were replaced with black and punk-style garish colours with the phrase &quot;Pardon our appearancecover under reconstruction&quot;. Jagger later apologised to Minnelli when he encountered her during a party at the famous discothèque Studio 54. The only celebrity whose face was not removed was former Beatle George Harrison. As with the original design, the colour schemes on the redesigned sleeves varied in different markets.

A third version of the album cover with the hand-drawn faces from the original Valmor ad was used on the 1986 CD reissue.

==Marketing and sales==
The lead single, &quot;Miss You&quot;, was released on 19 May 1978 by the band&#x27;s own Rolling Stones label, with the album track &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot; as the B-side; a longer, 12&quot; edit appeared on 2 June. The single was a commercial success, spending seven weeks on the UK Singles Chart, eventually peaking at number three. It fared better in the US, spending 20 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100longer than any prior Rolling Stones singleeventually peaking at number one, the band&#x27;s final single to top the chart. Despite its commercial success, its disco sound alienated part of the fanbase. Regarding this, Jagger stated:

&quot;Some Girls&quot; was released on 9 June 1978, with the catalogue number CUN 39108 (UK) and COC 39108 (US). The record continued the band&#x27;s commercial success. It spent 25 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two the week of 24 June, being kept off the top spot by the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack. It fared better in the US, peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and spending 88 weeks on the chart. &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;, backed by &quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;, was released as the second single on 28 August 1978 in the US, where it reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Respectable&quot;, again backed by &quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;, was released as the third single in the UK on 15 September, while &quot;Shattered&quot;, backed by &quot;Everything is Turning to Gold&quot;, appeared as the fourth and final single in the US on 29 November 1978. Both became Top 40 hits.

===Controversy===

Immediately following its release, &quot;Some Girls&quot; attracted controversy. According to Cyrus Patell, a prominent black music station WBLS in New York City refused to play &quot;Miss You&quot; due to what the station deemed to be &quot;the offensive racial attitudes of the album and the band.&quot; Additionally, the title track attracted controversy with the line &quot;Black Girls just want to get fucked all night/I just don&#x27;t have that much jam.&quot; Regarding the line, Ahmet Ertegun, the chairman of Atlantic Records (the US distributor of Rolling Stones Records), stated: &quot;When I first heard the song, I told Mick it was not going to go down well. Mick assured me that it was a parody of the type of people who hold these attitudes. Mick has great respect for blacks. He owes his whole being, his whole musical career, to black people.&quot; Incidentally, black-oriented radio stations began to boycott &quot;Some Girls&quot;, leading Jagger to tell &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;Atlantic tried to get us to drop it, but I refused. I&#x27;ve always been opposed to censorship of any kind, especially by conglomerates. I&#x27;ve always said, &#x27;If you can&#x27;t take a joke, it&#x27;s too fucking bad.&#x27;&quot;

On 6 October 1978, Ertegun met with Reverend Jesse Jackson, then leader of Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) to discuss the lyric. The meeting ended with Jackson declaring the song to be a &quot;racial insult&quot; that &quot;degrades blacks and women&quot;, threatening to boycott the record until a resolution was met. Ertegun concurred, saying, &quot;It is not our wish to in any way demean, insult, or make less of the people without whom there would be no Atlantic Records.&quot; After discussing the matter with Atlantic officials, who considered censoring the line, Earl McGrath, president of Rolling Stones Records, released a statement on 12 October on behalf of the band:

=== Tour ===

The Stones embarked on their summer US Tour 1978 in support of the album, which for the first time had them mount several small-venue shows, sometimes under a pseudonym. This was shorter and less ambitious than previous Stones tours, with only 26 shows performed over one and a half months, all of them in the US. Nonetheless, &quot;Some Girls&quot; became the third-best represented album in Stones&#x27; concert setlists after &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main St&quot;. All its 10 songs have been played live – a distinction it shares only with &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; and &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; – although the title song was never performed until 1999, and only &quot;Lies&quot; was never played after the last dates in support of the album.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Upon release, &quot;Some Girls&quot; received extremely positive reviews from music critics, with many agreeing it was the Stones&#x27; best work since &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; Music critic Pete Bishop wrote for &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; that &quot;Some Girls&quot; was &quot;the best album the Rolling Stones have done for years&quot;. Robert Hilburn ranked &quot;Some Girls&quot; one of the band&#x27;s best works in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, calling it a &quot;splendid return to form&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1978, Robert Christgau said,The Stones&#x27; best album since &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; is also their easiest since &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; or before. They haven&#x27;t gone for a knockdown uptempo classic, a &#x27;Brown Sugar&#x27; or &#x27;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&#x27;—just straight rock and roll unencumbered by horn sections or Billy Preston. Even Jagger takes a relatively direct approach, and if he retains any credibility for you after six years of dicking around, there should be no agonizing over whether you like this record, no waiting for tunes to kick in. Lyrically, there are some bad moments—especially on the title cut, which is too fucking indirect to suit me—but in general the abrasiveness seems personal, earned, unposed, and the vulnerability more genuine than ever. Also, the band is a real good one. Real good.In his review of the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in June 1978, Paul Nelson wrote that while &quot;Some Girls&quot; may have been the band&#x27;s finest LP since its &quot;certified masterpiece&quot;, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, &quot;what I won&#x27;t buy is that the two albums deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. [...] &quot;Some Girls&quot; is like a marriage of convenience: when it works — which is often — it can be meaningful, memorable and quite moving, but it rarely sends the arrow straight through the heart.&quot; Fellow critic Dave Marsh was also negative towards the record, citing inconsistent song quality and band performances. Three months later, in September, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner published his own review, rebutting that of Nelson. He heaped praise on the &quot;Miss You&quot; single, writing that the song &quot;exemplifies the polish, power, and passion of the Stones&quot;, equalled &#x27;Tumbling Dice&#x27; and &#x27;Brown Sugar&#x27;, and &quot;may even set new standards for the band.&quot; At the end of the year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named both the band and &quot;Some Girls&quot; their top artist and album of the year, respectively.

Writing for &quot;Circus&quot; magazine, Nick Tosches gave praise to the record, calling it their best in five years: &quot;After five years, the rhythm is back, and satisfaction and shelter are once again just out of reach.&quot; He further wrote that &quot;Some Girls&quot; more than makes up for the group&#x27;s prior works. After &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, Richard Riegel of &quot;Creem&quot; called &quot;Some Girls&quot; a return to &quot;refreshingly kinetic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. He further gave praise to Jagger&#x27;s vocal performances and Wood&#x27;s contributions on guitar. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Peter Silverton spoke positively of the record, highlighting &quot;Miss You&quot; as the standout. He concluded: &quot;Because they recorded so quickly (by their standards) they&#x27;ve achieved an immediacy on this which has been sorely lacking on their last few studio albums. It&#x27;s far from great but it&#x27;s certainly better than we had any right to expect after all these years.&quot; Kris Needs, in a review for &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine, complimented the album&#x27;s consistency when compared to its three predecessors. Needs further praised the lyrics as improvements over their prior works. &quot;NME&quot;″s Charles Shaar Murray gave the album a more mixed assessment. Although he agreed it was their finest work since &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, he felt it was more a Jagger solo record than a proper Rolling Stones record, praising his singing and Watts&#x27;s drumming. Nevertheless, he considered the production a step up from &quot;Black and Blue&quot; and gave high praise to &quot;Shattered&quot;.

At the end of the year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Some Girls&quot; the best album of 1978. Other publications, including &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, placed the album at numbers 4 and 18 in their respective lists of the year&#x27;s best albums.

===Reappraisal===

&quot;Some Girls&quot; has continued to receive critical acclaim, with many reviewers commending the band&#x27;s ability to blend punk and disco influences with their older signature style. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album, calling it &quot;a tough, focused, and exciting record, full of more hooks and energy than any Stones record since &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;&quot; Commending the group&#x27;s performance compared to their previous works, Erlewine felt the rock tracks sound &quot;harder and nastier than they have in years.&quot; He concluded his review stating: &quot;&quot;Some Girls&quot; may not have the back-street aggression of their &#x27;60s records, or the majestic, drugged-out murk of their early-&#x27;70s work, but its brand of glitzy, decadent hard rock still makes it a definitive Stones album.&quot; After a period of decline due to emerging music trends, Jeff Giles of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; credits &quot;Some Girls&quot; as successfully reinvigorating the band&#x27;s sound and keeping its own identity, writing: &quot;While the record incorporated elements familiar to longtime Stones fans...it infused the group&#x27;s staid sonic aesthetic with disco rhythms and a dash of jagged punk aggression.&quot; Giles concluded that the album proved that &quot;when they put their minds to it, the Stones were still capable of earning the title of the World&#x27;s Greatest Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Band.&quot;

Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Lÿndsey Parker described &quot;Some Girls&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s &quot;toughest, rawest, hookiest, cockiest, Stonesiest, most attitudinal albums ever.&quot; She further commented that it stands as one of few Stones albums to have &quot;held up as sonically, and still sound as gritty and urban and sexy and just downright cool, as their 1978 disco/punk/country/blues masterwork&quot;. In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Steven Hyden commented that the record was not a case of selling out, but rather showcased that the band &quot;could pull off the old magic using some flashy new tricks.&quot; Hyden further praised Richards&#x27; guitar performance, particularly on &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; and &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, writing that he is &quot;healthier and more prominent on &quot;Some Girls&quot; than on any Stones record since &quot;Exile On Main St.&quot;&quot; Matthew Fiander of &quot;PopMatters&quot; commented that after &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, the Stones were beginning to feel &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot;. He writes that &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; led to two records that weren&#x27;t as innovative as their prior works. Upon the emergence of punk rock, Jagger led the band to create what he calls &quot;the band&#x27;s most impassioned and fiery record of the &#x27;70s&quot; (excluding &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot;). Praising the band&#x27;s performance, particularly Wood, Fiander writes: &quot;What&#x27;s so amazing about this album is that, though it dabbles in newer trends...it still feels very much like a Rolling Stones record, a fresh angle on their long-time loves of blues and rock and roll traditions.&quot;

===Rankings===
&quot;Some Girls&quot; has frequently appeared on several &quot;best-of&quot; lists by multiple publications. In 2000, it was voted number 300 in writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003 &quot;Some Girls&quot; was ranked number 269 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 270 in a 2012 revised list, and 468 in the 2020 revised list. In 2015, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included the album in their list of the top 100 rock albums of the &#x27;70s, while a year later, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine placed the album at number seven on its list of the 100 greatest albums of the &#x27;70s.

==Reissues==

In 1986, the first compact disc version of the album was issued by the Stones&#x27; new label distributor, Columbia Records, as Rolling Stones/Columbia CK-40449. In 1994, with the acquisition of the Rolling Stones Records catalogue by Virgin Records, &quot;Some Girls&quot; was remastered and re-issued. The first pressing was packaged in a replica of the die-cut vinyl packaging, representing the redesigned 1978 cover in a pale color scheme. In 2009, the album was remastered and reissued by Universal Music; the reissue restored one of the brighter color schemes of the redesigned 1978 cover.

&quot;Some Girls&quot; was re-issued on 21 November 2011 as a 2-CD deluxe edition, including twelve songs originally recorded during the two sessions for the album (with the exception of &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; from August–September 1978 and &quot;We Had It All&quot; from 1979). A Super-Deluxe edition also included a DVD with live footage &amp; promo videos, a 100-page book, five postcards, a poster, and a 7&quot; 180-gram replica vinyl single of &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;. Most of the backing tracks were recorded in Paris between October 1977 and March 1978 with mostly newly recorded vocals by Jagger, which were recorded sometime during 2010 and 2011. The album re-entered the charts at No. 58 in the UK and No. 46 in the US. &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was released as a single on 13 November, which went to No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Singles Sales. &quot;So Young&quot; was the second single from the &quot;Some Girls&quot; reissue, released briefly for free on iTunes the same day &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was released. A video for &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was produced and later released on 19 December 2011.

In 2012 it was released by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version.

<text>Lake George or Lake Welaka is a broad and shallow brackish lake on the St. Johns River in the U.S. state of Florida.

==Geography==

The St. Johns River flows out of the lake at the north end at Rocky Point. To the west of this is Salt Cove, taking the flow from Salt Creek. Just south of Salt Cove is Lisk Point, named for a Dr. Lisk who built a house near the point. Steamboats coming down from Jacksonville made a counter clockwise loop around the lake with their first stop at Lisk Point.

Lake George is the second largest lake in Florida, after Lake Okeechobee. Lake George was the third largest lake behind Lake Apopka, but conversion of the littoral zone on the northern side of Lake Apopka to farm fields in the previous century reduced its surface area.

==History==

The name of Lake Welaka is taken from &quot;Welaka&quot; (meaning &quot;chain of lakes&quot;), the name for the St. Johns River in Muskogee language of the Seminole. The first European to visit the lake was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who as the Spanish governor of Florida, explored the St. Johns River in the spring of 1596.

Later, the Florida territory was sold to Britain. The royal botanist in America to King George III, John Bartram, explored the St. Johns River in 1765. It was John Bartram who gave the lake the name Lake George, in honor of his king.
In more recent years, Lake George has been home to an operational U.S. military bombing and aerial mining range. The range is affiliated with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pinecastle Bombing Range located in the Ocala National Forest just west of Lake George. The bombing ranges date back to World War II, when the Navy built bomb targets in Lake George and nearby Crescent Lake, and stationed personnel in the area to maintain the targets and perform search and rescue operations for downed pilots. Today, the range is under the operational control of nearby Naval Air Station Jacksonville.

The lake also hosts a wide variety of wildlife ranging from migratory water birds and alligators to a number of normally marine animals. Local springs in Lake George (and throughout the St Johns River) impart enough salt to the system to make the habitat suitable to resident and migratory marine species like Atlantic stingray, various species of mullet, striped bass and blue crabs. There is a large enough blue crab population to support a local fishery, making it one of the only fresh water blue crab fisheries in the world.

<text>Tai Tam Road in Hong Kong links the districts of Chai Wan and Stanley on Hong Kong Island. This road connects Chai Wan Road, the northern end of Shek O Road, Turtle Cove, Tai Tam and Stanley. The Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir&#x27;s dam constitutes a section of the road that is particularly narrow.

The dam was used to feature two-way traffic, which was problematic when buses crossed ways with other bigger vehicles, causing heavy congestion. On 25 August 2018, a new traffic light system was installed on the 400m dam, fixing the problem by allowing only one direction of traffic on the dam section at a time. This smart traffic light solution was designed and developed by an Engineering professor from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

An old bridge, Pak Chai Old Bridge, built in 1845, is also situated near the road, it was the predecessor of the current New Bridge in Tai Tam.

Tai Tam Road is one of the two roads that links Tai Tam and the urban district. The other road is Repulse Bay Road. Most importantly, Tai Tam Road is the sole link for glorious developments like the Redhill Peninsula, to the urban core, or vice versa, as the Redhill zone is high in economic activities and is very rich.

<doc id="989941" wikidata="Q7828325" url="?curid=989941" title="Totie Fields">
<text>Totie Fields (born Sophie Feldman; May 7, 1930 – August 2, 1978) was an American comedian.

==Early life==
Fields was born Sophie Feldman in Hartford, Connecticut. She started singing in Boston clubs while still in high school, taking the stage name of Totie Fields. She was Jewish.

==Career==
Fields gained fame during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. After years of Fields&#x27; successful appearances in nightclubs, Ed Sullivan gave Fields her first big break when he booked her on his show after seeing her perform at the Copacabana in New York in March 1964. She made multiple appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. She also appeared in a 1971 episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (Season 4, Episode 21) and a 1972 episode of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (Season 5, Episode 7) starring Lucille Ball.

It was on Mike Douglas in 1974 that Totie met the band Kiss, who were making their first national TV appearance. Fields joked that it would be funny if bassist Gene Simmons, under the makeup, turned out to be &quot;just a nice Jewish boy.&quot; Simmons (who is not only Jewish but was born in Israel) responded &quot;You should only know&quot;, to which Fields said, &quot;I do! You can’t hide the hook!&quot; (Simmons and Fields became friends and corresponded until her death.)

Fields also appeared on various television game shows in the late 1960s and 1970s, including multiple episodes of both &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;Tattletales&quot; with her husband George Johnston.

In 1972, Fields wrote a humorous diet book titled &quot;I Think I&#x27;ll Start on Monday: The Official 8½ Oz. Mashed Potato Diet&quot;.

==Health problems==
Fields was plagued with health problems in the last years of her life. She suffered from diabetes and in March 1976 she had surgery to remove a blood clot, but it failed and she developed phlebitis. In April 1976, Fields&#x27; left leg was amputated above the knee. This caused her to use a scooter for mobility and file a $2 million lawsuit against the hospital and doctors who had initially treated her. While still recovering from the amputation, Fields suffered two heart attacks.

Fields&#x27; last television appearance before her surgery was in a rare straight dramatic guest-starring role on the CBS-TV drama series &quot;Medical Center&quot;, which aired on February 23, 1976. In that episode, &quot;Life, Death, and Mrs. Armbruster&quot;, Fields played Phoebe Armbruster, a hospital janitor plagued by heart problems.

In June 1977, a much-thinner Fields starred in the Home Box Office special series &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, beginning her show seated in a wheelchair. As the audience welcomed her, she stood up, causing the cheering audience to stand with her. Said Fields: &quot;I&#x27;ve waited all my life to say this ... I weigh less than Elizabeth Taylor!&quot; At the time, Taylor had gained over 50 pounds during her marriage to Senator John Warner. Rather than avoid the subject of her amputation, Totie used it as material in her touring comedy act at theaters around the country.

In October 1977, Fields was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy to remove her right breast and also had an eye operation. However, Fields continued to perform, incorporating her health problems into her act. As a result, this changed the tone of her humor. Actor Van Johnson, who was a friend of Fields, was said to have remarked, &quot;When Totie lost weight, she wasn&#x27;t funny anymore.&quot;

Nevertheless, in 1978, during the last year of her life, Fields was voted &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; and &quot;Female Comedy Star of the Year&quot; by the American Guild of Variety Artists.

===Death===
On August 2, 1978, Fields was scheduled to begin a two-week engagement at Las Vegas’ Sahara Hotel when, on the eve of the opening, she was stricken at home by a blood clot, suffering a fatal pulmonary embolism. She was rushed to nearby Sunrise Hospital &amp; Medical Center, but was pronounced dead soon after. Her ashes were interred in Las Vegas; however, after her husband George Johnston&#x27;s death in January 1995, her remains were moved to the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles to be interred with his.

<text>Lake George or Lake Katunguru is a lake in Uganda. It has a surface area of and is a part of the African Great Lakes system, although it is not considered one of the Great Lakes. Like the other lakes in the region, it was renamed after a member of the British royal family, in this case, Prince George, later to become King George V. Lake George drains to the southwest into Lake Edward through the Kazinga Channel.

The area surrounding the lake is populated by the Batooro, Basongora, Banyampaka and Banyankore peoples, among others. All these nations speak closely related dialects which are generally referred to as Runyakitara language. &quot;Akatunguru&quot; is a word which means ‘onion’ and is used by all these different peoples. Thus, the lake came to be known as &quot;Katunguru&quot; because of its onion-like shape.

Welsh explorer Henry Morton Stanley was the first European to see the lake in 1875, after following the course of the Katonga River from Lake Victoria during his trans-Africa expedition. Thinking it was part of Lake Albert, he renamed it Beatrice Gulf. Exploration plans were aborted because of the threat of conflict with the kingdom of Bunyoro. On his second visit to the area, in 1888 during the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, Stanley discovered Lake Edward, and realizing that there were two independent lakes, gave Lake George its current name.

<text>A fish hook or fishhook, formerly also called an angle (from Old English &quot;angol&quot; and Proto-Germanic &quot;*angulaz&quot;), is a hook used to catch fish either by piercing and embedding onto the inside of the fish mouth (angling) or, more rarely, by impaling and snagging the external fish body. Fish hooks are normally attached to a line, which tethers the target fish to the angler for retrieval, and are typically dressed with some form of bait or lure that entices the fish to swallow the hook out of its own natural instinct to forage or hunt.

Fish hooks have been employed for millennia by fishermen to catch freshwater and saltwater fish. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of invertebrate prey (e.g. fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that mimic prey (lure fishing). In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of the Top 20 tools in human history.
==History==

The fish hook or similar angling device has been made by humans for many thousands of years. The earliest prehistoric tackle is known as a gorge, which consisted of a double-pointed stick with a thin rope tied to the middle. When angling, the gorge is laid parallel to the line and buried inside a bait ball, which can be swallowed easily by the fish. Once inside the fish&#x27;s mouth, the bait ball often softens and gets fragmented by the pharyngeal teeth, and any pulling along the line will cause the freed-up gorge to rotate transversely and get stuck across the fish&#x27;s gullet, similar to how a fish bone or chicken bone may pierce and obstruct a man&#x27;s esophagus. They performed similar anchoring functions to hooks, but needed &quot;both&quot; ends to claw firmly into the fish&#x27;s gullet to work properly.

The world&#x27;s oldest fish hooks (made from sea snail shells) were discovered in Sakitari Cave in Okinawa Island dated between 22,380 and 22,770 years old. They are older than the fish hooks from the Jerimalai cave in East Timor dated between 23,000 and 16,000 years old, and New Ireland in Papua New Guinea dated 20,000 to 18,000 years old.

The earliest fish hooks in the Americas, dating from about 11,000 B.P., have been reported from Cedros Island on the west coast of Mexico. These fish hooks were made from sea shells. Shells provided a common material for fish hooks found in several parts of the world, with the shapes of prehistoric shell fish hook specimens occasionally being compared to determine if they provide information about the migration of people into the Americas.

An early written reference to a fish hook is found with reference to the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; &quot;Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?&quot; Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron, and up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make their appearance in Europe in the 17th century and hook making became a task for specialists.

== Sections ==

The hook can be divided into different portions from the back ends to the front:
* The eye is the circular ring/loop at the back end to which fishing lines can be attached via knots, and (typically) receives the pulling force from the line.
* The shank is the (usually) straight shaft section of the hook, which relays pulling force from the line to the hook bend.
* The bend is the section where the hook curves back from the shank.
* The barb is a small reverse-pointing (relative to the main hook point) spike that grabs the surrounding fish tissue and stops the hook from sliding back out of its anchorage. Hooks that lack barbs are thus &quot;barbless&quot;.
* The point is the distalmost portion where the hook tapers into a sharp end, which pierces and embeds into the fish&#x27;s tissue.
The perpendicular distance between the hook point and the frontmost inner arc of the bend is known as the bite of the hook, which indicates the maximum depth the hook can be embedded or &quot;set&quot;. The width of the opening between the point and the shank is called the gap or mouth of the hook, which dictates the thickness of the tissue that the hook can catch.

== Hook types ==

There are a large number of different types of fish hooks. At the macro level, there are bait hooks, fly hooks and lure hooks. Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of hook types designed for different applications. Hook types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and eye type, and ultimately in their intended application. When individual hook types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these hook components are optimized relative to the hook&#x27;s intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly hook is made of thin wire with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait hooks make use of thin wire to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to hook design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, hooking efficiency, and whether the hook is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each hook type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of hooks, sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest).

=== Shapes and names ===

Hook shapes and names are as varied as fish themselves. In some cases, hooks are identified by a traditional or historic name, e.g. Aberdeen, Limerick or O&#x27;Shaughnessy. In other cases, hooks are merely identified by their general purpose or have included in their name, one or more of their physical characteristics. Some manufacturers just give their hooks model numbers and describe their general purpose and characteristics. For example:
* &quot;Eagle Claw&quot;: 139 is a Snelled Baitholder, Offset, Down Eye, Two Slices, Medium Wire
* &quot;Lazer Sharp&quot;: L2004EL is a Circle Sea, Wide Gap, Non-Offset, Ringed Eye, Light Wire
* &quot;Mustad Model&quot;: 92155 is a Beak Baitholder hook
* &quot;Mustad Model&quot;: 91715D is an O&#x27;Shaughnessy Jig Hook, 90-degree angle
* &quot;TMC Model 300&quot;: Streamer D/E, 6XL, Heavy wire, Forged, Bronze
* &quot;TMC Model 200R&quot;: Nymph &amp; Dry Fly Straight eye, 3XL, Standard wire, Semi-dropped point, Forged, Bronze

The shape of the hook shank can vary widely from merely straight to all sorts of curves, kinks, bends and offsets. These different shapes contribute in some cases to better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or artificial baits have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook shank. Hook descriptions may also include shank length as standard, extra-long, 2XL, short, etc. and wire size such as fine wire, extra heavy, 2X heavy, etc.

==== Single, double and triple hooks ====
Hooks are designed as either &quot;single&quot; hooks—a single eye, shank and point; &quot;double&quot; hooks—a single eye merged with two shanks and points; or &quot;triple&quot;—a single eye merged with three shanks and three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed from a single piece of wire and may or may not have their shanks brazed together for strength. Treble hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three shanks together. Double hooks are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Treble hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications.

==== Bait hook shapes and names ====
Bait hook shapes and names include the Salmon Egg, Beak, O&#x27;Shaughnessy, Baitholder, Shark Hook, Aberdeen, Carlisle, Carp Hook, Tuna Circle, Offset Worm, Circle Hook, suicide hook, Long Shank, Short Shank, J Hook, Octopus Hook and Big Game Jobu hooks.

==== Fly hook shapes and names ====
Fly hook shapes include Sproat, Sneck, Limerick, Kendal, Viking, Captain Hamilton, Barleet, Swimming Nymph, Bend Back, Model Perfect, Keel, and Kink-shank.

=== Points and barbs ===
The hook point is probably the most important part of the hook, because it is the point that must penetrate into the fish&#x27;s flesh first if the hook is to have any anchorage whatsoever. Both the profile of the hook point and its angulation influence how well the point will pierce the tissue. Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened.

Most modern hooks are &quot;barbed&quot;, with a backward-protruding spike (i.e. barb) that helps secure the hook anchorge by catching surrounding flesh to stop the point from sliding back out of the penetration. Because the barb increases the practical cross-sectional area of the hook point, it also negatively affect how far the point penetrates under the same force (especially when piercing harder tissue), although the tissue-grabbing ability of the barb alone is usually sufficient for maintaining the hook anchorage without needing a deep penetration.

Some hooks are &quot;barbless&quot;, with a simply tapered point and lacking any barb. Historically, ancient fish hooks were all barbless, but today barbless hooks are still used mainly to facilitate quicker hook removal and make catch-and-release less hurtful for the fish. The downside of barbless hooks is that because there is no barb to help secure the point anchorage, the hook is theoretically more susceptible to dislodging unless the penetration is maintained with a constantly taut line tension. There are however also some arguments that a barbless hook point will penetrate more smoothly into the fish tissue and thus allow a deeper hookset, compensating for the absence of barbs. Having a deeper hookset also means the stress tends to be concentrated nearer towards the hook&#x27;s bend rather than the point, allowing it to better withstand a heavier pulling load.

==== Hook point types ====
Hook points are also described relative to their offset from the hook shank. A kerbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right.

Hook points are commonly referred to by these names: needle point, rolled-in, hollow, spear, beak, mini-barb, semi-dropped and knife edge. Some other hook point names are used for branding by manufacturers.

=== Eyes ===
The eye of the hook is the widened ring/loop at its proximal end, with a hole where the fishing line (typically the leader line) is passed through (threaded) for fastening via knot-tying. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. Typical eye types include:
* Ringed eye or ball eye — a circular loop often with a closely opposed gap between the loop end and the loop base;
* Brazed eye — like a ringed eye, but the loop end is welded shut fully without any gap;
* Tapered eye — like a ringed eye, but with a pointed loop end;
* Looped eye — the loop end is elongated with the extended portion laid parallel to the hook shank;
* Needle eye — the eye hole is ellipsical, or just a narrow slit.
Most hook eyes are directly knotted to the fishing line and are responsible for relaying the pulling force from the line onto the hook body, but sometimes the line is passed cleanly through the eye and tied directly onto the shank instead of onto the eye loop — this is known as a snell knot or &quot;snelling&quot;, and the eye does not take part in transferring any force, merely serving to restrict line wobbling and knot sliding. In fishing lures, it is also not uncommon to see the hook being linked to the lure via a split ring through the eye, which allows the hook more range of motion.

Hook eyes can also be categorized into three types according to the angulation of the loop plane against the shank, where hooks with bent/&quot;turned&quot; eyes being more optimized for snelling:
* Straight — the eye is in-line with the shank;
* Up-turned — the eye is angled &quot;away from&quot; the hook point;
* Down-turned — the eye is angled &quot;towards&quot; the hook point.

Some hooks, such as the traditional Japanese &quot;Tenkara&quot; hooks, lack any opening for the line to be threaded, and are thus eyeless. Eyeless hooks instead have a widened &quot;spade end&quot; to help snelling the line onto the shank without slipping.

=== Size ===

There are no internationally recognized standards for hooks and thus size is somewhat inconsistent between manufacturers. However, within a manufacturer&#x27;s range of hooks, hook sizes are consistent.

Hook sizes generally are referred to by a numbering system that places the size 1 hook in the middle of the size range. Smaller hooks are referenced by larger whole numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3...). Larger hooks are referenced for size increases by increasing whole numbers followed by a &quot;/&quot; and a &quot;0&quot; (i.e. sizes &quot;over zero&quot;), for example, 1/0 (read as &quot;one nought&quot;), 2/0, 3/0... The numbers represent relative sizes, normally associated with the gap (the distance from the point tip to the shank). The smallest size available is 32 and largest is 20/0.

<text>Robert William Troup Jr. (October 18, 1918 – February 7, 1999) was an American actor, jazz pianist, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as the composer of the rhythm and blues standard &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot; and for the role of Dr. Joe Early with his wife Julie London in the television program &quot;Emergency!&quot; in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Robert William Troup Jr. was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His father Robert William Troup worked as a pianist for the family business J. H. Troup Music House and founded its Lancaster, Pennsylvania, branch store. He graduated from The Hill School, a preparatory school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in 1937. He went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics.

==Career==
===Military and music===
His earliest musical success came in 1941 with the song &quot;Daddy&quot; written for a Mask and Wig production. Sammy Kaye and His Orchestra recorded &quot;Daddy&quot;, which was number one for eight weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and the number five record of 1941; other musicians who recorded it include Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, Kay Kyser, and The Andrews Sisters. &quot;Daddy&quot; can be heard in the 1941 film &quot;Two Latins from Manhattan&quot;. The song is also performed by the title character in Tex Avery&#x27;s cartoon short &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (1943).

After graduating from college in 1941, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but did not receive orders until January 1942. After completing officer training, he was assigned as one of two dozen white officers to direct recruit training at Montford Point, the recruit depot for the first black Marines. In 1943 he became recreation officer and helped build a recreation hall, basketball court, and outdoor boxing ring. A friend installed a miniature golf course. At Montford Point, he also organized the first African-American band of U.S. Marines. During this time he composed &quot;Take Me Away from Jacksonville&quot;, which was to become an anthem of sorts for the Marines at Montford Point and other areas of Camp Lejeune.

In February 1942, Troup&#x27;s song &quot;Snootie Little Cutie&quot; was recorded by Frank Sinatra and Connie Haines with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and the Pied Pipers.

In 1946, Nat King Cole had a hit with Troup&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot;. The song was also recorded by Chuck Berry (1961), The Rolling Stones (1964), Depeche Mode (1987) and hundreds of other artists.

Troup&#x27;s hipster interpretation of the fairy tale &quot;The Three Bears&quot; was first recorded by the Page Cavanaugh Trio in 1946 and later by Leon McAuliffe, and Ray Ellington.

Troup&#x27;s recordings in the 1950s and 1960s were not commercially successful. He recorded for Liberty and Capitol. He wrote the title song (sung by Little Richard) for the 1950s rock and roll film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;. An instrumental version of his song &quot;The Meaning of the Blues&quot; appeared on the Miles Davis album &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;.

Around 1969, Troup collaborated with entertainer Tommy Leonetti, writing the lyrics for Leonetti&#x27;s song &quot;My City of Sydney&quot;.

===Television and films===

While he relied on songwriting royalties, Troup worked as an actor, appearing in &quot;Bop Girl Goes Calypso&quot; (1957), &quot;The High Cost of Loving&quot; (1958), &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (1959), and playing musician Tommy Dorsey in the film &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; (1959). He appeared as himself in the short-lived NBC television series &quot;Acapulco&quot;. He made three guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, and on two appearances, &quot;The Case of the Jaded Joker&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Case of the Missing Melody&quot; in 1961, he showed his musical talents. In 1960 he appeared with his wife Julie London in an episode of &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Incident at Royo Canyon&quot;. In 1969 and 1970, he appeared as &quot;Bobby&quot; in two episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot;, where he was a lounge piano player who helped Mannix unravel cases. Troup tried his luck at bowling on two episodes of &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot; (1973-1975). He again appeared as a piano player in a cameo on &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; in 1978.

His later films included &quot;First to Fight&quot; (1967) and &quot;Number One&quot; (1969) with Charlton Heston.

He appeared as disgruntled staff sergeant Gorman in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He is the last actor named by the camp PA announcer in the end credits, and he has the last line of the film: &quot;God-damned Army!&quot;

Troup had appeared in several episodes of the Jack Webb television series &quot;Dragnet&quot;. In 1972, Webb cast Troup as Dr. Joe Early in the television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; with Webb&#x27;s former wife Julie London as nurse Dixie McCall. Both Troup and London guest starred as &quot;Emergency&quot; personnel on an episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot; also produced by Webb. In 1979, Troup played the part of Sam Gill in the TV miniseries &quot;The Rebels&quot;.

==Personal life==
Troup married Cynthia Hare in May 1942. They had two daughters, Cynnie Troup (born 1943) and Ronne Troup (born 1945); both had careers in entertainment. The marriage ended in divorce in 1955. He met singer Julie London at the Celebrity Room where he was singing. He encouraged her to pursue her singing career, and in 1955 he produced her million-selling hit record &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;. London, previously married to actor Jack Webb (1947 to 1953), married Troup in 1959. They had one daughter, Kelly Troup (died 2002), and twin sons, Jody (died 2010) and Reese Troup.

==Death==
On February 7, 1999, Troup died of a heart attack in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks.

<doc id="989965" wikidata="Q7822271" url="?curid=989965" title="Tony Earley">
<text>Tony Earley (born 1961) is an American novelist and short story writer. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, but grew up in North Carolina. His stories are often set in North Carolina.

Earley studied English at Warren Wilson College and after graduation in 1983, he spent four years as a reporter in North Carolina, first as a general assignment reporter for &quot;The Thermal Belt News Journal&quot; in Columbus, North Carolina, and then as sports editor and feature writer at &quot;The Daily Courier&quot; in Forest City, North Carolina. Later he attended the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where he received an MFA in creative writing. He quickly found success writing short stories, first with smaller literary magazines, then with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which published two of his stories: &quot;Charlotte&quot; in 1992 and &quot;The Prophet From Jupiter&quot; in 1993. The latter story helped &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; win a National Magazine Award for Fiction in 1994.

In 1996, Earley&#x27;s short stories earned him a place on &quot;Granta&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;Best of Young American Novelists&quot;, and shortly after that announcement, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; featured him in an issue that focused on the best new novelists in America. He has twice been included in the annual &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; anthology. His writing style has been compared by critics to writers as distant as a young Ernest Hemingway and E. B. White. One of his favorite writers is Willa Cather.

On May 15, 2010 Earley gave a humorous commencement speech at Warren Wilson College. He was inducted into the Fellowship of Southern Writers in 2010.
He lives with his wife and two daughters in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is the Samuel Milton Fleming Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.

<text>Richmond (Māori: &quot;Waimea&quot;) is a town and the seat of the Tasman District Council in New Zealand. It lies south of Nelson in the South Island, close to the southern extremity of Tasman Bay. The town, first settled by Europeans in 1842, was named in 1854 after the town of Richmond on Thames near London. The town has an estimated population of as of .

Although most of Richmond lies outside the boundaries of Nelson City and the town is considered a separate urban area, Richmond is part of the wider Nelson metropolitan area along with nearby Brightwater, Hope, Māpua and Wakefield. The two unitary authorities (Nelson and Tasman) co-operate for tourism-marketing purposes via &quot;Latitude Nelson&quot;. Richmond forms part of the Nelson parliamentary electorate.

==History==

During the period 1853 to 1876, the Richmond urban area was administered as part of Nelson Province. With the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, Waimea County was created, effective in January 1877. Richmond was included in the Waimea County boundaries, and served as the administrative headquarters of the county.

In 1891, the administrative authority for the urban area of Richmond was transferred from Waimea County to the Richmond Borough Council.

Richmond Borough existed until the 1989 local government reforms, when the Tasman District was formed through the amalgamation of the Richmond Borough, Golden Bay County, Murchison County and Waimea County administrative areas.

==Demographics==

The Richmond urban area, as defined by Statistics New Zealand, covers and incorporates nine statistical areas. The Daelyn statistical area, covering , is the sole area of Richmond within Nelson City; the remaining eight areas are within Tasman District. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Richmond had a population of 15,279 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,896 people (14.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,859 people (23.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 5,739 households, comprising 7,338 males and 7,944 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female, with 2,805 people (18.4%) aged under 15 years, 2,442 (16.0%) aged 15 to 29, 6,456 (42.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,579 (23.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 93.0% European/Pākehā, 6.9% Māori, 1.2% Pasifika, 3.5% Asian, and 1.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 16.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 53.8% had no religion, 35.9% were Christian, 0.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.9% were Buddhist and 1.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,007 (16.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 2,664 (21.4%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,824 people (14.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 5,499 (44.1%) people were employed full-time, 1,968 (15.8%) were part-time, and 351 (2.8%) were unemployed.

<doc id="989968" wikidata="Q1315969" url="?curid=989968" title="Pax Sinica">
<text>Pax Sinica (Latin for &quot;Chinese peace&quot;; ) is a historiographical term referring to periods of peace and stability in East Asia, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia led by China. A study on the Sinocentric world system reveals that the multiple periods of &quot;Pax Sinica&quot;, when taken together, amounted to a length of approximately two thousand years.

The first &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; of the Eastern world emerged during the rule of the Han dynasty and coincided with the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; of the Western world led by the Roman Empire. It stimulated long-distance travel and trade in Eurasian history. Both the first &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; and the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; eroded at circa AD 200. 

== Periods of historical &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; ==
=== Han dynasty ===
The first period of &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; came into being during the Han dynasty of China. Domestically, the power of the emperor was consolidated following the devastation of the feudal system. The Rule of Wen and Jing (文景之治) and the Rule of Ming and Zhang (明章之治) were periods of societal stability and economic prosperity. Externally, the Han dynasty neutralized the threat posed by the nomadic Xiongnu following a series of wars. The boundaries of China were extended into what is modern-day western Xinjiang, South Korea (near modern Seoul), and Vietnam (around modern Huế). The Silk Road emerged as a major route that connected the East and the West after the Han diplomat Zhang Qian established contact with the numerous Central Asian tribes and states, thus facilitating commerce and cultural exchanges.

The &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; established by the Han dynasty is often compared to the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; of the Roman Empire. The &quot;Pax Sinica&quot; of the Han dynasty ended following decades of internal turmoil that later led to the downfall of the Han dynasty and a period of fragmentation in Chinese history.

=== Tang dynasty ===
The Tang dynasty was one of the golden ages in Chinese history and presided over another period of &quot;Pax Sinica&quot;. The Tang capital, Chang&#x27;an, was a major economic and cultural hub, and was the world&#x27;s largest urban settlement at the time. The Silk Road facilitated economic and cultural exchanges between China and the outside world, with Persians and Sogdians among those who benefited the most from such exchanges with China. In the north, the First Turkic Khaganate was defeated and annexed; in the west, the Tang dynasty extended its control as far as modern-day Afghanistan and the Aral Sea; in the east, Tang control reached Sakhalin. During its peak, the Tang dynasty maintained hegemony over 72 tributary states. During this period, Chinese culture was revitalized and became more diverse and cosmopolitan. The amount of interaction between China and Japan increased; Chinese influence on Japanese culture and politics became more prominent since the Tang dynasty.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
The Yuan dynasty was an imperial dynasty of China ruled by ethnic Mongol and was the main successor to the Mongol Empire. While the Yuan dynasty is often considered a legitimate Chinese dynasty that bore the Mandate of Heaven, historians usually classify this period of peace under the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;.

=== Ming dynasty ===
The Ming dynasty of China presided over another period of &quot;Pax Sinica&quot;. This period saw the formal institutionalization of the Chinese tributary system, illustrating the great political power of China at the time. The seven maritime expeditions led by Zheng He projected the imperial power of the Ming dynasty across Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa. During this period, China also exerted a great amount of influence on the culture and politics of Korea.

=== Qing dynasty ===
The Qing dynasty of China heralded another period of &quot;Pax Sinica&quot;. At its peak, it ruled over the fourth largest empire territorially, constituting 9.87 per cent of the world&#x27;s total land area. The High Qing era was a period of sustained population growth, economic prosperity and territorial expansion. The multicultural and multiethnic nature of the Qing dynasty was fundamental to the subsequent formation of the modern nationalist concept of &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot;. As the rulers of the Qing dynasty were ethnic Manchu, this period of peace is also sometimes known as &quot;Pax Manjurica&quot;.

=== Analogy For Modern China ===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China, in the immediate aftermath of the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, adopted an free-market economy, and since then, has been a prominent and preeminent power when it comes to the manufacturing of cheaply made goods, with manufacturing making up 36.5% of China&#x27;s total economy, and because of this, alongside other factors, China has rose immensely as a superpower, whereas America has declined somewhat in international power and influence, thus leading to China&#x27;s new period being defined as Pax Sinica by some scholars.

<doc id="989981" wikidata="Q160948" url="?curid=989981" title="Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia">
<text>Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia (; &quot;Kirill Vladimirovich Romanov&quot;; – 12 October 1938) was a son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Alexander II and a first cousin of Nicholas II, Russia&#x27;s last emperor. He was also the uncle of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. 

Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Imperial Russian Navy serving for 20 years in the Naval Guards. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, defying Nicholas II by not obtaining his consent. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before they were allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia. In World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915. He achieved the rank of rear admiral in the Imperial Navy in 1916. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards and swore allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the Provisional Governmental in the summer of 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland, where his wife gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only son. In exile, they lived for some years among his wife&#x27;s relatives in Germany and, from the late 1920s, on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac, France.

With the death of his cousins Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill proclaimed himself to be the head of the House of Romanov and, as next in line to the throne, as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor-in-exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchists in a division that continues today. He wrote a book of memoirs, &quot;My Life in Russia&#x27;s Service&quot;, which was published after his death. His granddaughter, Maria Vladimirovna, is one of two claimants to the headship of the House of Romanov.

==Early life==
Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia was born on in Tsarskoye Selo, at his parents&#x27; country residence, the Vladimir Villa. His father was Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the third son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. His mother was Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, née Duchess Marie Alexandrine of Mecklenburg. As a grandson in the male line to a Russian Tsar, he was titled Grand Duke. Kirill&#x27;s parents, wealthy and sophisticated, were influential figures in Russian society. Grand Duke Vladimir was cultured and a great patron of the arts, while Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was a renowned hostess in the Imperial capital. Both had imposing personalities and left a big imprint in the lives of Kirill and his siblings.

Grand Duke Kirill was six months old when his eldest brother, Alexander, died in childhood. He also had three younger siblings: Boris, Andrei, and Elena. The four surviving children were close to each other and to their parents, who were devoted to them. Kirill Vladimirovich grew up between his parents&#x27; residence in St Petersburg, the Vladimir Palace, and their country retreat, the Vladimir Villa in Tsarskoye Selo. Until he was fourteen years of age, Grand Duke Kirill was educated at home by private tutors. His education was supervised by General Alexander Daller, a retired artillery officer. He received military training and religion instruction, and learned the languages spoken by the Romanovs: Russian, English, French and German. During breaks from his daily lessons, he trained in a gym with his brothers at the Vladimir Palace. He traveled extensively with his parents visiting many European countries, including Spain. A love for music and carpentry work remained in him for the rest of his life. In 1911 he designed a propeller-driven sled that is considered to be one of the predecessors of the Aerosani.

==Naval career==
From an early age, Grand Duke Kirill had a love for the sea and his parents encouraged him to follow a career in the Imperial Navy. At age fifteen, in the autumn 1891, he began his training for the naval college. He began his naval career as a midshipman on the sail training ship &quot;Moriak&quot; in the summer of 1892. He returned to his home in Tsarkoe Selo in the winter 1892 and spent the following year studying for his examinations at the naval college. Between the summer 1893 and the autumn 1893, he was back at sea training in the ship &quot;Prince Pojarsky&quot;. After joining his father on a long trip to Spain, in the summer 1894, he joined his third training ship, the frigate &quot;Vovin&quot;. He concluded his training on the ship &quot;Vernyl&quot; on the Baltic Sea in the summer of 1895. Grand Duke Kirill&#x27;s uncle, Tsar Alexander III, died on and Kirill&#x27;s cousin, Nicholas II, became the new Tsar. During the coronation festivities in Moscow, Kirill fell in love with his paternal first cousin,
Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They flirted with each other at the balls and celebrations, but Victoria Melita was already married to Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, the only brother of Tsarina Alexandra.

In 1898, he took a trip around the world. One of his last stops was in New York in January 1899. He was invited to the newly formed Russian-speaking club &quot;Rousskaia Beceda&quot; and elected Honorary President. 

After graduating from the Naval Cadet Corps and Nikolaev Naval Academy, on 1 January 1904, Kirill was promoted to Chief of Staff to the Russian Pacific Fleet in the Imperial Russian Navy. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, he was assigned to serve as First Officer on the battleship , but the ship was blown up by a Japanese mine at Port Arthur in April 1904. Kirill barely escaped with his life, and was invalided out of the service suffering from burns, back injuries and shell shock.

==Marriage and children==
Grand Duke Kirill married his first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on 8 October 1905 without any consent from Tsar Nicholas II. Victoria&#x27;s father was Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the second eldest son of Queen Victoria. Victoria&#x27;s mother was Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, a daughter of Tsar Alexander II and Kirill&#x27;s paternal aunt.

The marriage caused a scandal in the courts of European royalty as Princess Victoria was divorced from her first husband, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse, also her first cousin. The Grand Duke of Hesse&#x27;s sister was Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna, the wife of Nicholas II. The Tsarina already disliked her former sister-in-law and first cousin, being instrumental in leading the opposition to the marriage in the Russian court. She was not alone in her opposition. Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna was also appalled at the effrontery of Kirill&#x27;s marriage. Shortly after Kirill&#x27;s return to Russia, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his imperial allowance and title of Imperial Highness, his honours and decorations, his position in the navy and then banished him from Russia, though the style of Imperial Highness and title of Grand Duke was restored on 5 October 1905, shortly after Kirill left Russia

In 1908, after the death of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, Nicholas II restored Kirill to his rank of captain in the Imperial Russian Navy and his position as aide de camp to the emperor. He was given the title Grand Duke of Russia and from then on his wife was styled as &quot;Her Imperial Highness&quot; Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna. From 1909–1912, Kirill served on the cruiser and was its captain in 1912. In 1913, he joined the Maritime Division of the Imperial Guard and was made Commander of the Naval Guards in 1915.

Grand Duke Kirill and Princess Victoria Melita had three children:
*Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia (2 February 1907 – 27 October 1951) married Friedrich Karl, Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925. They had seven children. 
*Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (9 May 1909 – 8 September 1967) married Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia on 31 October 1938. They had seven children. 
*Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (30 August 1917 – 21 April 1992) married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhransky on 13 August 1948. They had one daughter.

All the children were born to the rank of Prince and Princess of Russia, not entitled to the rank of Grand Duke or Grand Duchess as they were not children or grandchildren in the male line of a Russian Emperor according to the Pauline Laws. In accordance with these laws, Kirill raised his children to the rank of Grand Duke and Grand Duchess after assuming the position of senior male of the Romanov family, and Head of the Imperial House. This elevation was openly denounced by Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich when he published a private letter of the Dowager Empress in 1924 in which she stated that Kirill&#x27;s assumption of the position was &quot;premature.&quot; The Dowager Empress believed that her sons and grandsons might still be alive in Russia. Grand Duke Kirill wrote to Grand Duchess Xenia &quot;Nothing can be compared to what I shall now have to endure on this account, and I know full well I can expect no mercy from all the malicious attacks and accusations of vanity.&quot;

==Revolution==
During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the &quot;Garde Equipage&quot; (Marine Guard) to swear allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government, wearing a red band on his uniform. Kirill had authorised the flying of a red flag over his palace on Glinka Street in Petrograd and in correspondence with a Romanov relative claimed credit for &quot;saving the situation by my recognition of the Provisional Government&quot;. It is probable that he had hoped that by ingratiating himself with the Provisional Government he would be declared regent after Nicholas II was made to abdicate.

In June 1917 Kirill and Victoria moved to Finland and then escaped to Coburg in 1920. The exiled family subsequently moved to a small residence in the tiny French fishing village of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer.

==Life abroad==
After a London court order in July 1924 recognized Grand Duke Michael to be legally dead, Kirill first declared himself &quot;Guardian of the Throne&quot; on 8 August 1924 and then on 31 August 1924 he assumed the title &quot;Emperor of all the Russias&quot;. By the laws of the Russian Empire he was the heir to the throne. However, his claim caused division within the family; his principal rival, and the only one to reject his claim was Grand Duke Nicholas. In 1926 at a (Russian) monarchists congress in Paris the delegates voted to recognize Grand Duke Nicholas as their leader; however, with Nicholas&#x27;s death in 1929 Kirill became the undisputed leader of the monarchists.

After claiming the throne, Kirill became known as the &quot;Soviet Tsar&quot; because in the event of a restoration of the monarchy, he intended to keep some of the features of the Soviet regime. While living in exile, he was supported by some émigrés who styled themselves &quot;legitimists&quot; (&quot;legitimisti&quot;, in Russian легитимисты), underlining the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Kirill&#x27;s succession. The opponents of Kirill were known as the &quot;un-predetermined&quot; (&quot;nepredreshentsi&quot;, in Russian непредрешенцы); they believed that in the wake of the radical revolutionary events that the convening of a &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; was necessary in order to choose a new monarch for Russia.

Kirill found his strongest support among a group of legitimists known as the Mladorossi, a Russian émigré monarchist organization that ultimately became heavily influenced by fascism – although it distanced itself from other fascist movements. The organization began to exhibit pro-Soviet sympathies, arguing that the monarchy and the Soviet Bolshevik system could peacefully coexist (their slogan being &quot;Tsar and the Soviets&quot;, a socialist version of the traditional &quot;Tsar and People&quot;). Kirill became more wary of the organization when he learned that its founder, Alexander Kazem-Bek, was spotted meeting with an OGPU agent. Kirill accepted Kazem-Bek&#x27;s voluntary resignation.

Just before he died, he wrote his autobiography, &quot;My Life in Russia&#x27;s Service – Then and Now&quot; which was published in 1939.

Kirill was succeeded by his son Vladimir Kirillovich who styled himself &quot;Grand Duke and head of the Russian Imperial House&quot;.

Kirill was buried at the ducal mausoleum at &quot;&quot;, Coburg. Following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the remains of Kirill and his spouse were transferred from Coburg to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, Russia on 7 March 1995 after negotiations conducted by his granddaughter Maria Vladimirovna.
Among his activities he was close to members of the Nazi Party, when he was in Germany. On one occasion, he is said to have paid Erich Ludendorff &quot;a sum of nearly half a million gold marks in 1922-1923 for German-Russian national matters&quot;.

<text>Waino Edward Hendrickson (June 18, 1896June 22, 1983) was an American Republican politician &amp; businessman, the final Governor of the Territory of Alaska, before statehood.

Hendrickson was born in Juneau in 1896. He served in World War I before he became a manager at the Juneau city dock. He worked in business before he entered politics in 1946 and was elected Mayor of Juneau. He served as mayor until 1953. He was also a member of the Territorial House from 1948 to 1953.

He was Secretary of Alaska Territory from 1953 to 1959 in which capacity he served as acting governor twice because of the resignations of Governors Frank Heintzleman and Mike Stepovich.

==Early life==
Hendrickson was born June 18, 1896, in Juneau, Alaska, where he grew up the son of Finnish immigrants. After graduating from Juneau High School in 1916, he worked in the mine. After an accident, Hendrickson lost partial sight in one eye. After this, he served in the U.S. military during World War I, and was en route to France before the armistice was signed. After being discharged from the army, he worked as a manager at the Juneau city dock.

==Political career==

Hendrickson entered politics in 1946, when, upon the urging of his friends, he was elected mayor of Juneau. In this role, he helped the city gain the power to levy and use sales tax, which had not been enforced before, leading to a lack of funding for Juneau. Because of the collection of this tax, Hendrickson developed Juneau, leading the city to become the first city in Alaska to be fully paved. He served as Mayor of Juneau until 1953. While serving in this role, he was also a member of the territorial House of Representatives from 1948 to 1953.

In 1953, Hendrickson was appointed Secretary of Alaska Territory (equivalent to Lieutenant Governor of Alaska today) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, under Governor Frank Heintzleman. He held this office until statehood, serving as acting governor twice, once in 1957, and again from 1958 to 1959. Hendrickson was the first Alaska governor born in the territory. After statehood Hendrickson served on several government commissions, as well as chairing the Interior Department&#x27;s Alaska Field Committee, and the Juneau office of the Bureau of Land Management. He retired due to poor eyesight, in 1965.

==Later life==

Hendrickson would stay up at night to care for his wife, who was ill with cancer. She died in 1962.

After his retirement, Hendrickson went to live with his daughter in Anchorage, Alaska, and spent the rest of his life with her until he died in 1983, at the age of 87.

<text>The traditional music of Tuvalu consists of dances, including &quot;fatele&quot;, &quot;fakanau&quot; and &quot;fakaseasea&quot;. The influence of the Samoan missionaries sent to Tuvalu by the London Missionary Society from the 1860s resulted in the suppression of songs about the traditional religions or magic and many songs were lost. As the influence of the missionaries diminished in the 20th century the traditional dances were revived and the siva dance tradition from Samoa also became popular. 

&quot;Te titi tao&quot; is a traditional skirt placed upon another skirt - a &quot;titi kaulama&quot; - and tops (&quot;teuga saka&quot;), headbands, armbands, and wristbands continue to be used in performances of the &quot;fatele&quot;.

Te Vaka, an Oceanic music group, contains Tuvaluans and musicians with Tuvaluan ancestry; Te Vaka performs original contemporary Pacific music or &quot;South Pacific Fusion&quot;.

==History==
Poetry recitations were a common feature of traditional music before European contact, but this practice has since vanished.

In 1960-1961 Gerd Koch, an anthropologist, made recordings of traditional songs on the atolls of Niutao, Nanumaga and Nukufetau. These songs were considered in a 1964 musicological publication, with a selection of the songs published in 2000 as &quot;Songs of Tuvalu&quot; together with two CDs of the recorded songs.

The influence of the Samoan missionaries sent to Tuvalu by the London Missionary Society from the 1860s resulted in the suppression of songs about the traditional religions or magic, with the Samoan missionaries also influencing the development of the Tuvaluan language. The missionaries introduced church hymns and European song structures and melodies started to influence Tuvaluan music. However some pre-missionary songs survived and were recorded by Gerd Koch. In the early 1960s the transistor radio provided access to European pop music and the Hawaiian/Tahitian guitar rhythms, which influenced modern Tuvaluan music. The recordings of Gerd Koch continue to be broadcast over Radio Tuvalu along with modern Polynesian music.

The traditional music of Tuvalu encompassed different types of song with a strong emphasis on dancing songs. Other types were play songs (sung during counting game, games of skill and other games); work songs which the women performed, such as while preparing coconut fibre string; fishermen&#x27;s calling songs; songs of praise (&quot;viki&quot; or &quot;taugafatu&quot;); and laments for deceased members of the family. The tradition of singing appropriate for a funeral is called &quot;kupu&quot; and is similar to the &quot;fakaseasea&quot;.

The &quot;fatele&quot;, in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012. The modern Tuvaluan style has absorbed many influences and can be described &quot;as a musical microcosm of Polynesia, where contemporary and older styles co-exist&quot;.

==Traditional Tuvaluan song structure==
Traditional Tuvaluan songs are very short poems which are repeated. These songs have strong rhythm, which the performers would maintain by clapping or hitting their hands on the floor or a sound box, such as a tea chest; with the tempo increasing as the song was repeated. While Tuvaluan songs convey a dramatic story, the concentrated song structure often omitted reference to key events in the story. Gerd Koch describes traditional Tuvaluan songs:

An example of a pre-missionary song is &quot;Te foe, te foe kia atua&quot;, which is a &quot;fakanau&quot; dancing song, from Niutao recorded by Gerd Koch.

This concentrated dramatic story is an account of men of Niutao who come across a strange canoe out in the ocean. The men call out in greeting to the canoe but the crew make no reply. The men of Niutao believe it is a ghostly canoe – containing the gods – so in fear of impending disaster the men rapidly paddle home to the safety of Niutao. When performed the strong rhythm of the song imitates the strokes of the men paddling, with the increase in tempo in the repetition of the song providing the dramatic emphasis of the escape from disaster.

== Tuvaluan dance music==

Dancing songs are the most common type of traditional Tuvaluan song. Older style dancing songs were performed while sitting, kneeling or standing. The two primary traditional dances of Tuvalu are the &quot;fakanau&quot; (for men) and &quot;oga&quot; (for women) and &quot;fakaseasea&quot;. Of these, the &quot;fakanau&quot; was a Niutao and Nukufetau dance performed primarily by the men, which was performed while sitting, or on Niutao while kneeling or standing, but without moving from the spot – the story of the song was illustrated by movements of the arms, hand and upper body. An elder could stand in the middle of a circle of performers keeping time. The &quot;fakanau&quot;, &quot;oga&quot; and the &quot;fakaseasea&quot; were used for celebrations and for praising fellow islanders. The only instrument was the use of a small wooden slit drum or a sound box, such as a tea chest; or the time was beaten with a fan or small rolled mat or the use of the palm of the hand on the floor.

The role of the &quot;fakanau&quot; as a praise song was an important part of Tuvaluan culture. A composer of a praise song would practice with the performers beforehand, and tell the subject of the song so he would have time to gather gifts. After the first performance, the subject would give the gifts to the performers, and would often continue to do so after future performances as well. The &quot;fakanau&quot; and &quot;oga&quot; tradition has since died out.

The &quot;fakaseasea&quot; was mainly performed by young unmarried women, who were on their feet, dancing and moving their arms, hand and upper body; while men and women would sing and beat the time. It is a slower song with very loose rules on how to dance to it, with variations on different islands with different names. The &quot;fakaseasea&quot; tradition continued although performed mainly by elders.

The traditional &quot;fatele&quot; was performed in the sitting or kneeling position by five or six young women, who while singing, moved their arms, hand and upper body; the men and woman act as the chorus. The most popular form of Tuvaluan dance music in the modern era is the &quot;fatele&quot;, which is influenced by European melody and harmony and is competitive, with each island divided into two sides. Lyricism is an important part of the &quot;fatele&quot; tradition, which begins with the older men singing a song in a meeting hall (&quot;maneapa&quot;), then gradually repeating it louder and quicker as the others join in; they also use empty cabin cracker cans or wooden boxes to beat the rhythm.

The modern &quot;fatele&quot; involves the young unmarried women on their feet, dancing in lines; with the men facing the dancers, sitting on the floor beating the time with their hands on the mats or on wooden boxes. The dancers enact the story being retold, and the music finally climaxes and ends abruptly. The festivities, including church festivals and weddings, at which the &quot;fatele&quot; are performed can go on for hours. The &quot;fatele&quot; tradition is shared with the music of Tokelau.

The swaying in rhythmic dances was considered erotic by missionaries and most traditional dancing was forbidden. The ban came along with restrictions on traditional religious activity as these dances served a spiritual purpose as well. As the influence of the missionaries diminished in the 20th century the siva dance tradition from Samoa became popular. This dance focuses on the individual dancers who have space in which to perform the steps and arm, hand and body movements of the Samoan siva dance tradition.

<doc id="989992" wikidata="Q882851" url="?curid=989992" title="Mike Stepovich">
<text>Michael Anthony Stepovich (March 12, 1919 – February 14, 2014) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the last non-acting Governor of the Territory of Alaska. Stepovich served as Territorial Governor from 1957 to 1958, and Alaska was given U.S. statehood in 1959.

Stepovich was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and grew up in Portland, Oregon. His parents had immigrated to the United States from what is now Montenegro and Croatia in the late 19th century. Following his education and military service during World War II, Stepovich established a law practice in Fairbanks and began his political career by winning three terms in the Alaska Territorial legislature. During his term as governor, he was a leading advocate in the effort to gain statehood for Alaska. Following Alaska&#x27;s admission to the Union, he made an unsuccessful run for a U.S. Senate seat and two unsuccessful attempts to be elected Governor of Alaska.

Stepovich was involved in public service for decades, ranging from his service in World War II to his post-statehood political career. He was a large part in the effort for obtaining Alaska Statehood, beginning with his appointment as governor in 1957.

==Early life and education==
Stepovich was born to a well-known Montenegrin miner father, Michael &quot;Wise Mike&quot; Stepovich, and a Croatian mother, Olga (from Sutivan, Brač), in Fairbanks, Alaska, on March 12, 1919.
The Stijepovich family is one of the oldest families in Risan, today Montenegro. His father, originally called Marko, moved from there to the USA 1892. His parents divorced when he was 6 months old and his mother took him to Portland, Oregon, where he was raised by his mother and stepfather. Stepovich was educated in parochial schools and Portland&#x27;s Columbia Preparatory School before enrolling at the University of Portland in 1937. He graduated from Gonzaga University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1940 and from the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Laws in 1943.

=== Military service ===
After completing his law degree, Stepovich enlisted in the United States Navy and was assigned to Camp Parks&#x27; legal office. After three-and-a-half years of military service, he was discharged as a yeoman third class. Following his discharge in 1947, he returned to Portland for a short time to court his future wife before moving to Fairbanks, Alaska.

== Career ==
In Fairbanks, he took his bar examination, was appointed city attorney by the end of the year, and established a private practice.

Stepovich began his political career in 1950 when, running as a Republican, he won a seat in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives. Two year later he advanced to take a seat in the Alaska Territorial Senate. He remained in the senate for two terms, becoming the minority leader in 1955.

=== Territorial Governor of Alaska ===

The appointment of Stepovich as Governor of Alaska Territory came as a result of a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton. Seaton had traveled to the territory to interview potential candidates following the resignation of Governor B. Frank Heintzleman. While the Fairbanks attorney had not applied for the position, Seaton was still impressed by him. President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Stepovich for the position on May 9, 1957, and he took office on June 5 as the territory&#x27;s first native-born non-acting governor.

Much of the new governor&#x27;s term was spent lobbying for Alaskan statehood. In this effort he traveled widely through the Continental United States speaking and giving interviews on behalf of the territory. His efforts even included a January 19, 1958 appearance on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

===Involvement in the Alaska Statehood Act===

Stepovich was seated in the House Gallery when the House cast their votes on the Alaska Statehood Act. Upon its passage by the House, Stepovich would celebrate with Delegate E.L. &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett, as well as New York Representative Leo W. O&#x27;Brien, and Pennsylvania Representative John Saylor. The bill passed, despite opposition from the powerful Chair of the Rules Committee, Virginia Representative Howard Smith &amp; House Minority Leader Joe Martin. This was namely because of powerful House Speaker Sam Rayburn, who was one of the most influential members of Congress, and heavily backed the Alaska Statehood Act, partially because Alaska was heavily Democratic. Cheers came from the streets of Alaska as the news came to the soon-to-be state, and an Alaskan native remarked &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing. I like to see it come on fine. I will enjoy my first vote for President.&quot;
President Eisenhower signed the Alaskan Statehood Bill on July 7, 1958. Following this event, Stepovich issued a proclamation setting the dates for primary and general elections to determine officeholders for the new state, setting the elections for November 25. The Territorial Governor then resigned on August 1, 1958, to run for a seat in the United States Senate. Following his departure, Territorial Secretary Waino Edward Hendrickson succeeded as Acting Governor.

=== Post-gubernatorial career ===
Stepovich&#x27;s bid for a United States Senate seat was unsuccessful. He was defeated by Ernest Gruening in the November 25, 1958, election, held just before Alaska became a state on January 3, 1959.

In 1960, Stepovich campaigned against an unsuccessful ballot initiative to move the state capital from Juneau, Alaska, to Anchorage, Alaska.

Stepovich ran for governor of Alaska in 1962, winning the Republican nomination, but was defeated by the Democratic incumbent William A. Egan by a narrow margin.

Stepovich lost to Wally Hickel in the Republican primary for governor in 1966. This was his final campaign for office.

Following his unsuccessful Senate run, Stepovich returned to his legal practice in Fairbanks. He remained there until 1978 when he and his wife relocated to Medford, Oregon. Despite the move, the former governor still maintained his legal residence in Fairbanks.

==Personal life and family==
Stepovich married Matilda Baricevic in November 1947. The couple had 13 children. His daughter Nada married NBA player John Stockton. His niece is actress and playwright Nicole Burdette.

On November 25, 2003, Stepovich&#x27;s wife, Matilda, died.

Stepovich was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of Alaska Fairbanks on May 10, 2009.

While visiting his son in San Diego, California, Stepovich suffered a head injury as result of a fall. He died on February 14, 2014, after spending six days in a hospital. At the time of his death, he was the last living former American governor who left office in the 1950s. Stepovich&#x27;s body was returned to Fairbanks, Alaska. A memorial service was held for him at Sacred Heart Cathedral on February 28, 2014, followed by burial at Birch Hill Cemetery.

<text>Ohakune is a small town at the southern end of Tongariro National Park, close to the southwestern slopes of the active volcano Mount Ruapehu, in the North Island of New Zealand.

A rural service town known as New Zealand&#x27;s Carrot Capital, Ohakune is a popular base in winter for skiers using the ski fields (particularly Turoa) of Mount Ruapehu and in summer for trampers hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing.

==Toponymy==
The Ngāti Rangi iwi say the Māori language name &quot;Ohakune&quot; comes from the phrase &quot;he Ohakune ki te ao&quot;, which broadly means &quot;an opening to a new world&quot; and refers to the descent from Mount Ruapehu into the valley and swamps of the area. In 2019 the New Zealand Geographic Board changed the official name to &quot;Ōhakune&quot;, indicating that the first letter was a long vowel, but swiftly reverted to &quot;Ohakune&quot; without a macron when Ngāti Rangi objected.

==History==

===Pre-European history===
The lands to the south and west of Mount Ruapehu were historically inhabited by the Māori of the Ngāti Rangi iwi. 

Around the middle of the seventeenth century a marae at Rangataua, a small town about five kilometres south-east of Ohakune, was attacked and the inhabitants were driven from their homes by raiders from the Ngāti Raukawa, an iwi from farther east in Manawatū. Around 75 of the village&#x27;s population were slain and the dozen or so survivors fled to Maungarongo and established a pā on the present site of the town of Ohakune.

===Establishment===

The Crown purchased 10,000 acres of Native land at Ohakune in 1879.

In 1883, the first engineering reconnaissance commenced for the Marton—Te Awamutu section of the North Island Main Trunk Railway and a base was established upon the present site of Ohakune, soon becoming a permanent camp for railway and road construction workers. Settlement of the town commenced in the early 1890s around the confluence of the Mangawhero and Mangateitei rivers, along the road from Raetihi to Taumarunui. Forty quarter-acre sections in the township were sold at auction in February 1893. Prior to the completion of the railway to the town, all supplies had to be transported via cart from Hunterville, or from Whanganui via the Whanganui River steamer to Pipiriki and then by cart for the remaining distance. By March 1908 the railway line had reached Ohakune, with new development around the railway station to the northeast of the early settlement becoming known as Ohakune East and then Ohakune Junction. The period of railway construction activities was followed quickly by intensive timber milling; as the forest was cleared, cattle and sheep were introduced and farming progressed. Ohakune was constituted a town district in August 1908 and in November 1911 attained borough status.

=== Railway ===
The central North Island section of the North Island Main Trunk was the last part to be constructed. Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward drove the last spike on 6 November 1908, and the &#x27;Last Spike&#x27; monument is at Manganui-o-te-Ao, near Pokaka to the north of Ohakune. A two-day NIMT service started on 9 November 1908, with an overnight stop at Ohakune (for northbound passengers) or Taumarunui (for southbound passengers). On 14 February 1909, the first NIMT express left Auckland for Wellington, an overnight trip scheduled to take 19 hours 15 minutes, with a sleeping car, day cars with reclining seats, and postal/parcels vans. The dining car went on the north express from Wellington to Ohakune, then transferred to the southbound express, so avoiding the heavy gradients of the central section.

A railway branch line from Ohakune to Raetihi was opened on 18 December 1917 and closed on 1 January 1968. A truss bridge formerly used by this branch still stands near the Big Carrot. In March 1918 there was a major fire at Raetihi. A relief train was sent along the branch line from Ohakune to rescue hundreds of people, many of whom were temporarily blinded by smoke and had sought shelter in waterways.

In the 1980s a section of the trunk line between Ohakune and Horopito was realigned, with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds.

Although the railway was important for many years for moving passengers and freight including timber and produce, by the mid-1980s Ohakune was no longer a major stop for passenger or goods trains.
=== Timber milling ===
Alec Bennett and John Punch opened a sawmill at Raetihi in 1893. The tramway they built to remove logs from the bush now forms part of Te Ara Mangawhero, a new cycling and walking track between Ohakune and Mount Ruapehu. The earliest sawmill in Ohakune may have been J F Bell&#x27;s mill, in operation there in 1904. Another of the early mills in Ohakune was established in 1909 by Frank Carter, whose business later developed into the firm Carter Holt Harvey. Carter&#x27;s mill operated on the south side of the Mangateitei Stream until the bush around it was cleared in 1915. Sawmilling was the main industry in Ohakune between 1909, after the railway reached Ohakune, and the late 1920s. After this, sawmilling declined in importance as most of the bush around Ohakune had been felled by then, and in 1929 the Great Depression began.

Milling picked up again in the 1960s when the Karioi Forest was replanted, and in the 1970s a pulp mill opened at Karioi.

=== Market gardens ===
From the early 1900s, Chinese began to settle in Ohakune, which had fertile, loamy volcanic soil good for growing crops. They worked as gardeners and shopkeepers, selling produce to bushmen and sawmillers in the area. Market gardening expanded after the arrival of the railway, as access to markets in Auckland and Wellington became easier. Chinese market gardeners began to lease recently deforested land, removing stumps, improving the soil and then growing oats, root vegetables and cabbages. After several years grass would be sown on the improved land and the lease would return to the land owners, while the Chinese would move to another site to garden. By 1939 there were about 20 Chinese market gardeners operating from Ohakune with about 1500 acres under cultivation in the greater Ohakune/Raetihi area, and in 1941 a report stated that Ohakune and the surrounding district produced almost half of the North Island&#x27;s vegetables. During World War 2, Ohakune became a base for the government&#x27;s Services Vegetable Production scheme. Growers were contracted to supply vegetables to New Zealand and Allied Forces in the Pacific, and to the army base at Waiouru. Labour was scarce, so prisoners from the nearby Waikune Prison Camp were brought in to help tend the crops. 

After World War 2, some market gardens were converted to farms for returned soldiers, so there was less land available for the Chinese gardeners to lease. Consolidation of gardens into bigger operations, specialisation and mechanisation reduced the number of market gardens. Produce began to be transported by road rather than rail. Many Chinese growers left the area, often moving to Pukekohe, and the percentage of gardens in Ohakune run by Europeans increased. A big decrease in the number of market gardens occurred in the 1980s as the original farmers died.

=== 1942 flood ===
A serious flood occurred in Ohakune on 6 January 1942, killing one resident. Both rivers in the town burst their banks, topsoil on market gardens was washed away, and huge quantities of silt and &quot;driftwood&quot; (probably &#x27;slash&#x27;, waste wood from forestry) were deposited on the streets. The Waimarino Acclimatisation Society blamed the floods on removal of native bush on Mount Ruapehu, leading to erosion.

=== Ohakune Mountain Road, Turoa ski field and Turoa Alpine Village ===

For many years skiers, trampers and residents of Ohakune promoted the idea of a road from Ohakune up Mount Ruapehu to provide access to a new ski area. In 1910 the Ohakune Ruapehu Alpine Club created a track, and for years there were funding requests, engineering reports and discussions with the Tongariro National Park Board and the government. In November 1952, the Ohakune Chamber of Commerce and Ohakune Borough Council asked the Tongariro National Park Board for permission to build a nine-mile (14.5 km) road to Blyth Hut. Residents donated money and volunteers worked on the road, aiming to build a mile of road each year. It took 10 years of mainly volunteer labour to construct the road, which was officially opened on 4 March 1963. The road was extended higher up the mountain in 1966-1967. Over its short length the road rises through rimu forest, beech forest and tussock.

A ski tow operated by an Ohakune company was installed on the mountain in May 1962, and with construction of the access road completed, development of the Turoa ski field became viable. Turoa ski field opened for skiing in 1978, with its official opening in 1979.

Initially, accommodation for skiers visiting the newly-opened ski field was provided at a large caravan park at Rochfort Park, which had formerly been Rochfort Station on the closed Raetihi railway branch line. This land later became the site of the Big Carrot and Carrotland. The ski field company then bought 50 acres (20ha) of land nearby on the southern outskirts of Ohakune and built Turoa Alpine Village, consisting of chalet- and A-frame style lodges, to provide accommodation for the 1980 ski season and beyond.

== Marae ==
Ohakune has two marae. Maungārongo Marae and Tikaraina Ringapoto or Ko Te Kingi o Te Maungārongo meeting house are meeting places of the Ngāti Rangi hapū of Ngāti Tui-o-Nuku. Ngā Mōkai Marae and Whakarongo meeting house are a meeting place of the Ngāti Rangi hapū of Ngāti Tongaiti.

In October 2020, the Government committed $836,930 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade a cluster of seven marae, including Maungārongo Marae, creating 95 jobs.
== Geography ==
Ohakune is located in the Ruapehu District and the Manawatū-Whanganui region, to the immediate south-west of the slopes of the Mount Ruapehu stratovolcano. The associated Ohakune volcanic complex is just to the north of the town and the small maar lakes Rangatauanui and Rangatauaiti are to the south of the town. The town is west of Waiouru, northeast of Whanganui, north of Wellington and south of Auckland, and is at an elevation of .

The Mangateitei Stream flows roughly east to west through the town, joining the Mangawhero River which flows southward from near the railway station and then turns west.

==Climate==

==Demographics==
Ohakune covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Ohakune had a population of 1,182 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 198 people (20.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 87 people (7.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 450 households, comprising 621 males and 561 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.11 males per female. The median age was 36.1 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 225 people (19.0%) aged under 15 years, 246 (20.8%) aged 15 to 29, 555 (47.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 150 (12.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 69.8% European/Pākehā, 34.8% Māori, 2.3% Pacific peoples, 7.9% Asian, and 3.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 18.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 53.6% stated that they had no religion, 29.2% were Christian, 4.8% had Māori religious beliefs, 2.3% were Hindu, 0.5% were Buddhist, 0.3% were Muslim, and 2.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 168 (17.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 162 (16.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $31,100, compared with $31,800 nationally. 141 people (14.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those aged at least 15 was that 528 (55.2%) people were employed full-time, 144 (15.0%) were part-time, and 39 (4.1%) were unemployed.

==Economy==
In the year to March 2021, the GDP of Ohakune was $74m, representing approximately 10% of the GDP for the Ruapehu District as a whole. The economy of the town is largely based on services, particularly for skiers and other visitors to Tongariro National Park. The largest categories of GDP were retail trade (15.8%), arts and recreation services (14%), accommodation and food services (10.9%) and owner-occupied property operation (9.1%). In the same period there were 781 filled jobs, with 22.5% of these in retail trade, 19.9% in accommodation and food services, and 14.3% in arts and recreation services.

In 2017, Canterbury produced almost half of New Zealand&#x27;s carrots and parsnips and the Manawatu-Whanganui region was the next largest production area, with two-thirds of carrots produced in the North Island coming from Ohakune. However, by 2023, vegetable growers in Ohakune said they were wondering if their businesses were still viable, citing increases in the price of fuel, fertiliser, sprays, power and other things needed to produce the crops, increasing compliance costs, as well as the difficulty of finding staff and rising costs of wages.

==Facilities==
Ohakune has the usual range of shops and services found within a typical small New Zealand town. In 2015 Ohakune had a dental clinic, pharmacy, fire station, police station, ambulance station, social welfare branch, churches, a marae with a district nurse, gymnasium, and a health shuttle for outpatient care at Whanganui Hospital away. The nearest medical centre with GP, nurses and physiotherapist is to the west, at Raetihi.

=== Media ===
Ohakune is covered by the &quot;Whanganui Chronicle&quot;, a daily paper part of the &quot;NZ Herald&quot; network. Ski FM Network operates out of Ohakune hosted by 91.8 FM Ruapehu/Turoa, a Central North Island radio station. During the winter it operates as an &quot;information desk&quot; for information about the snow levels for the region.

== Recreation ==
Ohakune has facilities for snow sports, trout fishing, mountain biking, tramping and bushwalking. Ohakune provides easy access to the nearby ski fields of Mount Ruapehu; the large commercial ski resorts of Turoa (the closest resort to Ohakune) and Whakapapa, as well as the small club field Tukino. Various outlets for clothing and ski hire, as well as purchasing lift tickets, are available in the town.

Ohakune has a number of clubs and is home to the Ruapehu Rugby &amp; Sports Club.

Ohakune caters for various summer activities, and provides access for trampers hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Mountain bikes are available for hire at various outlets in town.

Various water activities are available on the nearby rivers, with jet boating on the Whanganui River and rafting available along the Whanganui, Rangitikei and Tongariro rivers. Trout fishing is available in nearby lakes and rivers, including the world-famous Tongariro River. 

The Bridge to Nowhere in the Whanganui National Park located between Ohakune and Whanganui is a popular destination for trampers and mountain bikers.

== Events ==
The Carrot Carnival has been held in Ohakune since 1996. It was created as a way to boost the town after eruptions of Mount Ruapehu in 1995 and 1996, plus several years of poor snowfall, caused the local economy to shrink by 20%. Tourists and skiers stayed away, causing a $10 million drop in business. The Carrot Carnival features games and competitions between growers, foods made with carrots, and family-friendly attractions. 

Ohakune Mardi Gras has also been held since 1996, when it was organised as a way to bring visitors in after the Ruapehu eruptions damaged tourism. It is both a ski party and celebration of winter, and includes musicians, stalls and rides. The event was cancelled in 2017 after the previous year&#x27;s event suffered a large loss, but it was revived as an R18 event from 2018.

The Big Mountain Short Film Festival has been held since 2006. It is a free festival screening short films and featuring speakers on topics relating to low-budget film-making and story telling.

==Landmarks==

=== Big Carrot and Carrotland ===

On the eastern edge of the town there is a 7.5 metre-high replica of a carrot, known as &#x27;The Big Carrot&#x27;. This is reputedly the world&#x27;s largest model carrot: it was originally constructed as a prop for a television advertisement for the ANZ Bank in the early 1980s. After filming was complete, the carrot was donated to the town in recognition of the area&#x27;s reputation as the source of a high proportion of New Zealand&#x27;s carrots, and installed in its current position in 1984. In 2011, the carrot was painted black for the Rugby World Cup hosted that year in New Zealand. 

Carrot Adventure Park (or Carrotland) opened on 1 October 2016 next to the Big Carrot. The park features a playground with a carrot-shaped car and fibreglass vegetable people: a swede, a potato, a Brussels sprout and a parsnip, representing crops grown in Ohakune. There are information boards illustrating the district&#x27;s history of market gardens and forestry, and the park also has picnic spots, a confidence course and a BMX track. In 2023 a carrot-shaped space rocket was added to the park. It was largely funded by Youtubers Joshua Carrott and Oliver Kendal. After visiting the BIg Carrot, Carrott declared that it was his spiritual home and wanted to support the park. The 5.3 m spaceship was built by Max Laver of Piopio.

=== War memorial gate ===

There is a war memorial in the form of a large arched gate on Clyde Street at the entrance to Jubilee Park. The memorial was officially opened in October 1932, with marble tablets on it listing the names of 26 men who had enlisted in the district and died during World War 1. Another tablet was added later, listing men who fell in World War 2.
=== Railway station and signal box ===

Ohakune railway station was built around 1908 as part of the North Island Main Trunk development, and is one of the oldest buildings in Ohakune. Ohakune&#x27;s original railway signal box was pulled down years ago, but in 1991 one of the signal boxes from Paekākāriki Station was moved to a site on the corner of Thames Street and Ohakune Station Road and restored as part of Ohakune&#x27;s railway heritage. The station building and signal box were listed by Heritage New Zealand as a Historic Place Category 2 in 2009, and local resident Bob Norling was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Service Medal in 2020 for &quot;services to railway heritage and community&quot;, for his involvement in restoring the station. Near the station is a small railway museum.

=== Weather Rock ===
In the 1980s and &#x27;90s Ohakune was home to the Weather Rock, a local landmark in Thames Street popular with tourists for photographs; the rock used to &quot;forecast&quot; current weather conditions with a sign listing sayings such as &quot;If rock is hot – sunny&quot;, &quot;If rock is wet – raining&quot;, etc., and appropriately for the region, &quot;If rock is bouncing – earthquake&quot;.

==Education==
Ohakune has three schools.

*Ohakune School is a state full primary (Year 1–8) school. It has students as of 
*Ruapehu College is a state secondary (Year 9–13) school. It has students as of 
*Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngati Rangi is a state Kura Kaupapa Māori, offering a full primary (Year 1–8) education. It has students as of

Ohakune is on the Intercity coach network, with a non-daily service running north to Auckland via Taumarunui and south to Palmerston North via Whanganui.

===Rail===
Ohakune is on the North Island Main Trunk Railway. The railway station is located off Thames Street in the Ohakune Junction area, approximately from Clyde Street in the centre of town. Ohakune railway station has the second highest elevation of any operating railway station in New Zealand behind National Park Railway Station: a sign on the platform side of the station building lists its height at 2,029 feet (618.4 metres) above sea level. 

Passenger services are provided by the national operator KiwiRail under its Great Journeys New Zealand division. The Northern Explorer is a non-daily service operating between Auckland and Wellington. The journey to/from Auckland crosses the famous Raurimu Spiral.

Seventeen kilometres to the east of the town is the Tangiwai Bridge, site of New Zealand&#x27;s worst railway accident, the Tangiwai Disaster, on 24 December 1953.

==Popular culture==
A mock-romantic song from the mid-1960s called &quot;September in Ohakune&quot; was recorded by Peter Harcourt on an LP called &quot;Land of the Long White Shroud&quot;.

In 1998, the Big Carrot featured on one of a set of ten postage stamps depicting New Zealand town icons.

<doc id="989997" wikidata="Q17014194" url="?curid=989997" title="Post–September 11 anti-war movement">
<text>The post–September 11 anti-war movement is an anti-war social movement that emerged after the September 11 terrorist attacks in response to the war on terror.

==Background==
On September 11, 2001 a series of coordinated terrorist attacks against the United States killed approximately 3000 people. These attacks appear to have been carried out by a small group of individuals who formed part of the al-Qaida network: Islamists without formal backing from any state (though there were and are suspicions that Al-Qaida was aided and funded by several Arab/Muslim countries). Following them U.S. president George W. Bush declared a campaign with the stated aim of defeating terrorism which he called the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;.

Although which of his programs constitute part of this &quot;war&quot; have has never been formally articulated, the term appears to embrace at least two major Bush administration initiatives: a set of changes to U.S. criminal law and immigration law (most notably through the USA PATRIOT Act) and the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The term may also embrace such related matters as the creation of a Department of Homeland Security.

Many of those on the left and others who would come to oppose the War on Terrorism did not believe that it was really a response to the terrorist attacks. They point to the Project for the New American Century as proof that Bush was merely using the atrocities as an excuse to put the Imperialist plans of the neoconservatives into action. They also point to what they perceive as the ineffectiveness of Bush&#x27;s strategy for actually reducing terrorism and the lack of any link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida.

===Immediate reaction to the attacks===
The immediate, worldwide reaction to the attacks was widely described at the time as &quot;shock&quot;. No national government claimed responsibility or connection to the attacks. Indeed, the governments most associated with Islamism sought to distance themselves from the attacks. Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakel, the foreign minister of Afghanistan&#x27;s then-ruling Taliban government, declared, &quot;We denounce this terrorist attack, whoever is behind it.&quot; Mohammad Khatami, the Iranian president, said he felt &quot;deep regret and sympathy with the victims.&quot; Shaykh Abdul Aziz al-Ashaikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the Senior Ulama, said, &quot;Hijacking planes, terrorizing innocent people and shedding blood constitute a form of injustice that can not be tolerated by Islam, which views them as gross crimes and sinful acts.&quot; Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said, &quot;We completely condemn this serious operation... We were completely shocked...&quot; Many, though, considered those reactions as hypocrisy, since several Arab and Muslim states encourage anti-Americanism and many newspapers in the Arab world—for example the Islamist opposition press in Egypt—openly celebrated the September 11 attacks. Moreover, states like Iran and Syria were known for long-year funding of terrorist networks such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Also, Al-Qaida training camps were operating undisturbed in Afghanistan and the organization held bank accounts in Saudi Arabia.

On the left, condemnation of the attacks was equally general, although often including (even in the days immediately after the attack) condemnation of ostensibly related aspects of U.S. policies. Noam Chomsky&#x27;s statement in the immediate wake of the attacks begins by condemning this &quot;major atrocit[y]&quot; and &quot;horrendous crime&quot;, but also by contextualizing it in terms of the Clinton-era U.S. attack on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory and prefiguring what would be a widespread concern for the left worldwide: &quot;...the crime is a gift to the hard jingoist right, those who hope to use force to control their domains.&quot; Similarly, from Vijay Prashad, &quot;The attacks must be condemned without reservation. But we must be certain to recognize that these are probably the work of frustrated and alienated human beings hemmed in by forces that are anonymous and that could only be embodied by these structures.&quot; Martin Woollacott, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called the attacks, &quot;above all a stupendous crime&quot;, but also wrote, &quot;America&#x27;s best defence against terrorism originating from abroad remains the existence of governments and societies more or less satisfied with American even-handedness on issues which are important to them. Plainly, this is furthest from the case in the Muslim world.&quot;

Elected officials generally identified as being on the U.S. &quot;left&quot; also joined in strongly condemning the attacks, in this case almost universally without pointing out a context. For example, the day after the attack, Senator Edward Kennedy described the attack as &quot;vicious and horrifying... acts of unspeakable cruelty... a massive tragedy for America&quot;, and commended President Bush for &quot;his strong statement... about finding and punishing the perpetrators of this atrocity.&quot; Three days after the attacks, Congress passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use force against &quot;those responsible&quot;. The Senate voted 98–0, the House 420–1, with only Barbara Lee (D-California) dissenting. In a lengthy interview explaining her dissent, Lee pointed to her professional training as a social worker and remarked, &quot;Right now, we&#x27;re dealing with recovery, and we&#x27;re dealing with mourning, and there&#x27;s no way... [we should]... deal with decisions that could escalate violence and spiral out of control.&quot;

===An anti-war movement forms===
Within days of the September 11 events, it was widely agreed that the attacks were carried out by al-Qaida, although , al-Qaida responsibility for the attacks may have been a minority view in majority-Muslim countries, though not among Muslims in the U.S. A small segment of the population also calls this belief into question. A much larger segment (though still a minority) of the left (both in the U.S. and elsewhere) concurred with the clear majority of Muslims that a military attack on Afghanistan was not the correct answer to the September 11 events. This anti-war view was even more widespread among both leftists and Muslims with respect to the later attack on Iraq.

The left was somewhat fragmented with respect to the invasion of Afghanistan. U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, who had opposed the Kosovo War and would soon oppose the invasion of Iraq, voted to authorize military action against Afghanistan, although he would later characterize it as a &quot;disaster&quot;, a &quot;nightmare&quot;, and &quot;counterproductive&quot;. U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney, speaking on September 24, acknowledged that &quot;We must find and hold accountable all those who perpetrated those most terrible crimes against our nation and its people&quot;, but denounced what she saw as impending &quot;suspensions of fundamental civil liberties&quot; and said that she was &quot;greatly concerned that we are about to engage in an extremely hazardous military campaign of unknown duration, with unrealistic objectives and perhaps even ultimately harmful long-term consequences for our nation&quot;, adding, &quot;Already there is growing disquiet in the Muslim world that the U.S. is poised to turn its terrorist campaign into a war against Islam.&quot; Indian leftist writer Arundhati Roy, writing on September 29, strongly condemned both the attackers who had &quot;blown a hole in the world as we knew it&quot; and Bush for reacting by going to war against Afghanistan: &quot;President Bush&#x27;s ultimatum to the people of the world – &#x27;If you&#x27;re not with us, you&#x27;re against us&#x27; – is a piece of presumptuous arrogance. It&#x27;s not a choice that people want to, need to, or should have to make.&quot;

Within a few weeks after September 11, it became clear that two major prongs of the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;war on terrorism&quot; were to be a set of changes to U.S. criminal law and immigration law and an invasion of Afghanistan. An international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived on the left to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights. This movement constituted a loose coalition of groups united in their opposition to U.S. military campaigns in the Middle East. Most prominent in the ranks of the movement were leftists; pacifists and others with longtime associations with global peace movements; and Arabs and Muslims, including, but by no means limited to, Islamists. Most commentary focuses on the &quot;anti-war movement&quot; in the singular, although in many ways it could be argued that there is a plurality of different anti-war movements, who may not have anything in common with each other beyond their shared opposition to U.S. foreign policy.

The movement (or movements) included an enormous variety of groups and individuals that could not be categorised as &quot;left&quot; in any conventional terms, who had a variety of reasons for opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan and later of Iraq. In addition to the many non-leftist Arabs and Muslims in the movement, there were also European nationalists uncomfortable with U.S. unilateralism (their numbers would greatly increase in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq). There was also an uneasy relationship with explicitly antisemitic groups who charged that the war was being waged on behalf of Israel; with the few, small right-wing anti-war groups; and with certain political fringe groups, such as the followers of Lyndon LaRouche. These latter groups sometimes participated in the same demonstrations with other opponents of the war, but seldom were actively involved in any of the same organized coalitions.

Almost no one denied the connection between Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban rulers and al-Qaida. However, various leftists opposed the Afghanistan invasion and the subsequent invasion of Iraq on the following grounds: pacifism; belief that the war was illegal under international law; opposition to perceived U.S. imperialism; disbelief (especially in the case of Iraq) in the sincerity of the U.S.&#x27;s stated war aims of counter-terrorism and the spread of political freedom; belief that the wars were motivated by neocolonialism and petroleum politics; and, in a few cases, denial of al-Qaida&#x27;s responsibility for the September 11 attacks.

Another argument against the Afghanistan invasion was that war would bring unnecessary suffering on the people of Afghanistan and that it was not the most effective way to dislodge or isolate al-Qaida: that in fact it would inflate their importance and gain them recruits. Similarly, in the case of the later invasion of Iraq, many felt that Iraq was not a threat to the United States and that a preemptive attack was morally wrong though Saddaam Hussein was widely seen as a violent dictator. Many people condemned the latter war because they doubted U.S. and other claims about Saddam&#x27;s relation to al-Qaida, about his possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and about the effectiveness of war as a means of containing WMDs, or because of the lack of United Nations support for war.

Many Islamists and Arabs, and a few leftists, saw the military campaigns as battles in a religious war—a crusade—against Islam. This was the obverse of the ideas expressed, for example, by Samuel P. Huntington in &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot;. However this view was mostly rejected by those on the left, who generally rejected the doctrine that the world is divvied up in to civilisations with fundamentally opposed cultures.

In the United Kingdom, the Stop the War Coalition was formed within weeks of the 9/11 attacks. The coalition rallied political groups around three main principles: condemnation and rejection of both the War on Terrorism and the 9/11 attacks ; opposition to the erosion of civil rights and the racist backlash that followed 9/11 ; unity of the constituent groups in their aim to build a mass-movement to prevent wars in the context of the War on Terrorism, but diversity in the sense that constituent groups were free to develop their own political analysis and local activities. Over the next two years, the Stop the War Coalition organised a series of mass demonstrations in London, together with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain, culminating in the largest demonstration in British history on 15. February 2003, with 1–2 million demonstrators. Although the Stop the War Coalition includes a broad range of political groups, it is often criticised because of the strong influence of the Socialist Workers Party.

== Anti-war organizations and rallies==
The anti-war movement has organized massive anti-war rallies, in opposition to the War on Terrorism. Some of the most prominent organizations began by opposing the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Others formed only after the Afghanistan invasion and after Bush&#x27;s January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address was widely seen on the left as threatening confrontation with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, which Bush referred to collectively as an &quot;axis of evil&quot;.

===Left and anti-war in the U.S.===
The most prominent U.S.-based movement groups are Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), Not in Our Name (NION), and United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ).

ANSWER was one of the first U.S. left groups to form after the September 11 attacks in order to express dissent from the nascent &quot;War on Terror&quot;. With the U.S. left divided on the merits of military action against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the International Action Center (IAC), a group founded in 1992 by former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark and perceived as closely tied to the Workers World Party. Drawing on that party&#x27;s tight organization, ANSWER attracted an estimated 8,000 people to their first major action, an &quot;Anti-War, Anti-Racist&quot; rally and march in Washington, D.C., primarily in protest of the then impending invasion of Afghanistan. This rally occurred on September 29, 2001, a mere 18 days after the September 11 attacks. This rally happened several hours after the first national protest against the war, an unpermitted march of 2,000 through the streets of Washington which had been organized by the Anti-Capitalist Convergence.

Notwithstanding their organizational ability, Workers World&#x27;s role in ANSWER and ANSWER&#x27;s role in the movement were (and are) controversial, both on the left and elsewhere. In a typical example of a critique from within the left, Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom writing on October 24, 2002 for &quot;Z&quot;, about a then-impending nationwide set of demonstrations (called by ANSWER), begin their discussion with a scathing critique of the views of Workers World, IAC, and (by implication) ANSWER. Describing IAC as an &quot;extremely energetic antiwar group&quot; and laying out its relationship to ANSWER, Clark, and Workers World (which they call &quot;WWP&quot;), they declare, &quot;WWP holds many views that we find abhorrent. It considers North Korea &#x27;socialist Korea&#x27;... a fantastic distortion of the reality of one of the most rigid dictatorships in the world. IAC expresses its solidarity with Slobodan Milosevic. ... [T]o champion Milosevic is grotesque. The ANSWER website provides an IAC backgrounder on Afghanistan that refers to the dictatorial government that took power in that country in 1978 as &#x27;socialist&#x27; and says of the Soviet invasion the next year: the &#x27;USSR intervened militarily at the behest of the Afghani revolutionary government&#x27;... In none of IAC&#x27;s considerable resources on the current Iraq crisis is there a single negative word about Saddam Hussein. There is no mention that he is a ruthless dictator. (This omission is not surprising, given their inability to detect any problem of dictatorship with the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan.)...&quot;

Albert and Shalom go on to discuss the quandary this presents for people like them opposed to the war: &quot;If there were another large demonstration organized by forces more compatible with the kinds of politics espoused by other antiwar activists, including ourselves, then we would urge people to prefer that one. And there is no doubt we should be working to build alternative organizational structures for the antiwar movement that are not dominated by IAC. But at the moment the ANSWER demonstration is the only show in town.&quot;

Finally, they discuss how they expect these politics will and will not affect the demonstration: &quot;IAC demonstrations... have programs skewed in the direction of IAC politics, but without excluding alternative voices. In general, the IAC speakers will not be offensive so much for what they say, but for what they don&#x27;t say. That is, they won&#x27;t praise Saddam Hussein from the podium, but nor will they utter a critical word about him. However, as long as other speakers can and do express positions with a different point of view, the overall impact of the event will still be positive, particularly in the absence of other options. Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point. What they will experience will be a powerful antiwar protest. And most of the public will see it that way too.&quot;

ANSWER attracted significant numbers to their rallies, but acquired few formal endorsements. In contrast, the list of early endorsers of NION&#x27;s spring 2002 &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot; reads like a Who&#x27;s Who of the U.S. left, ranging from celebrities such as Laurie Anderson, Deepak Chopra, and John Cusack, to intellectuals like Noam Chomsky, Toni Morrison, and Howard Zinn.

NION was founded a full six months after ANSWER, as it was becoming clear that the U.S.&#x27;s military response to September 11 would not stop with Afghanistan. Despite its wide endorsements, NION&#x27;s origins too gave pause to some on the left. Quoting again from the same article by Albert and Shalom, &quot;Significant impetus behind NION comes from the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). RCP identifies itself as followers of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism. Their website expresses support for Shining Path in Peru, ... an organization with a gruesome record of violently targeting other progressive groups. For the RCP, freedom doesn&#x27;t include the right of a minority to dissent (this is a bourgeois formulation, they say, pushed by John Stuart Mill and Rosa Luxemburg)...&quot;

Despite these origins, Albert and Shalom see NION in a rather different light than ANSWER—and this goes far to explain the list of endorsements by prominent members of the U.S. Left. Albert and Shalom acknowledge the broad endorsements of the &quot;eloquent and forceful&quot; pledge and write, &quot;RCP does not push its specific positions on NION to the degree that IAC does on ANSWER&quot;, pointing out the contrast between the contents of the respective organizations&#x27; web sites: &quot;[T]he NION website and its public positions have no connection to the sometimes bizarre views of the RCP. The case for participating in NION events is stronger than for ANSWER events. It still makes overwhelming sense to build better antiwar coalitions, but in the meantime supporting NION activities promotes an antiwar message that we support, with relatively little compromise of our views.&quot;

The third major U.S. group, UFPJ, founded around the time Albert and Shalom were writing, has been generally exempt from such accusations of sectarianism. Motivated no doubt in part by some of the same issues raised by Albert and Shalom, UFPJ has been, from the start, a broad coalition of organizations; NION itself is a member of UFPJ, as are MoveOn, the National Council of Churches, and Albert&#x27;s own &quot;Z&quot; magazine.

The groups have collaborated at times on events, although collaboration has not always been easy. In perhaps the most infamous incident, Rabbi Michael Lerner was banned from speaking at a February 16, 2003 anti-war rally in San Francisco, less than a month before the U.S. invaded Iraq. It was generally believed that this was done at ANSWER&#x27;s behest, because Lerner had been critical of what he perceives as ANSWER&#x27;s anti-Israel politics. Lerner, though irked that NION and UFPJ did not stand up for his inclusion as a speaker, continued to encourage people to attend the rally.
===Anti-war in Europe===

There was widespread and passionate support for the U.S. in Europe after the September 11 attacks, and little opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan and moves against the Al&#x27;Qaeda network. However, a large anti-war movement began to develop when the American government started agitating for an invasion of Iraq. Before and during the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, opposition to George W. Bush the war was widespread in Europe. Many were angered by what was seen as a stubborn unilateralism.

Some have speculated that European countries were against a war because of a resurgence of &quot;anti-American&quot; sentiment. Contributing to these feelings were the positions taken by the George W. Bush administration on international issues: for example, American policies on global warming and environmental protection, on the International Criminal Court, on pre-emptive attack, and what has long been perceived as a policy of stubborn unilateralism practiced by successive American governments culminating in the Bush administration and especially the neoconservatives within it.

The commonly articulated reasons included: a belief that the UN process (including Hans Blix&#x27;s inspections) should be allowed to reach its natural conclusion, an aversion to America&#x27;s neo-con bellicosity, a belief that the threat posed by Iraq was being exaggerated, a preference for multilateralism, a belief that war might just &quot;serve as a recruiting sergeant for Al-Qaida&quot;, and fear of the &quot;fog of war&quot; i.e. the &quot;uncertain and unpredictable consequences&quot; of invading another country.

The scale of the change in attitudes in Europe between 9/11 and late 2002 was astonishing, with the enormous goodwill and support of the immediate 9/11 period having been greatly eroded. Changes in the Republic of Ireland are an example of this. In the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center, Ireland declared an unprecedented full national day of mourning for the victims. The reaction was two-fold: horror at the deaths but also a strong degree of sympathy for the United States, whom Ireland saw as a friend, particularly after US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s welcome interventions during the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. By February 2003, the public reaction to the Bush administration actions over Iraq had changed America&#x27;s image utterly. Instead of being seen in a positive light, the United States under Bush was seen as a &#x27;bully&#x27; determined to force the international community to accept its demand for a war against Iraq, and if necessary ignore the international community in the United Nations. Hence, an estimated 100,000 people took part in an anti-war march in Dublin (the organisers had expected 20,000) with demands being made that the United States be refused permission to use Shannon Airport as a stop over point when flying their soldiers from the United States to countries bordering Iraq. Yet opinion polls showed that the Irish &quot;would&quot; support a war &quot;if&quot; it had United Nations approval. What they would not support was a non-UN-sanctioned war declared in defiance of the UN by the Bush administration.
Such &#x27;anti-Bush&#x27; and anti-war sentiments were reflected in many western European countries, generally with the populace less sympathetic to the U.S. stance even when politicians in a given country (e.g. the UK and Spain) aligned themselves with the U.S. position. The general populations of France and Germany were opposed to the war and it would have been difficult for their governments had they failed to reflect those sentiments in policy. France&#x27;s position in particular has been very much maligned within the U.S. After the first UN resolution, France advised the U.S. that it (the USA) had sufficient UN support to launch a war and that it (the USA) need not return to the UN for a second resolution. Nonetheless, the U.S. and the UK did push for a second resolution (to help Mr. Blair gain support for the war within the UK) and France reversed its earlier positions, unable then to agree to what was proposed. The French government took the position that the UN inspection process should be allowed to be completed.

Some observers, being then unconvinced that Iraq&#x27;s secular government had any links to Al-Qaida, the terrorist group that attacked the U.S., expressed puzzlement that the U.S. would consider military action against Iraq and not against North Korea, which had claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the U.S.

Many critics of the American War on Terror, including the UK&#x27;s foreign intelligence services, did not believe that American actions would help to end terror, and believed that they would actually increase the ranks and capabilities of terrorist groups; some believed that during the war and immediate post-war period there would be a greatly increased risk that weapons of mass destruction would fall into the wrong hands (including Al-Qaida).

America&#x27;s presence in Middle-Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia has been one source of discontent that has served as an excuse to Islamic fundamentalists to commit acts of violence. Even as the U.S. downscales its presence and existing bases (e.g. Saudi Arabia), it is not clear that the U.S. presence in Iraq will be anything but de-stabilising because many in the Muslim world resent the &quot;infidel&quot; presence in the Middle East, using this as a means of inciting the disenfranchised in their populations to violence. On the other hand, a stable democracy in Iraq could have a stabilising influence. Clearly, there was a gamble there, and only the post-war period will prove which viewpoint was correct.

Perhaps the most commonly heard criticism, at least outside of the U.S., was that the Bush Administration&#x27;s reason for going to war with Saddam was to gain control over Iraqi natural resources (i.e., oil). Though few doubt that nuclear and WMD proliferation is a serious threat to stability and well-being, many felt that a war in Iraq would not aid in eliminating this threat and that the real reason was to secure control over the Iraqi oil fields (at a time when arguably links with Saudi Arabia were at risk).

Popular opposition to war on Iraq in Europe led to a wave of anti-war rallies, which climaxed in an international synchronized anti-war demonstration around the world on February 15, 2003. The largest of these rallies were in Rome, Barcelona, and in London where over one million marched at a rally organised by the Stop the War Coalition. All three of these cities are in countries that were part of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; which took part in the war in Iraq.

==Criticism of the anti-war movement==

===Allegations of hypocrisy and influence of &quot;radical&quot; groups===
Some critics, such as exiled Iranian writer Amir Taheri, view portions of the anti-war movement in Western Europe as &quot;an alliance between the radical Left and hard-line Islamists.&quot; In an article published in a somewhat edited version on June 10, 2004 in the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, much of which is a rehash of his November 18, 2003 article in &quot;National Review&quot;, Taheri writes &quot;In this month&#x27;s election for a new European Parliament, voters in several European Union countries, notably France and Britain, are offered common lists of Islamist and leftist candidates... Europe&#x27;s moribund extreme Left has found a new lease on life thanks to hundreds of young Muslim militants...&quot;

Without actually naming the UK-based Stop the War Coalition, he discusses the membership of its steering committee: &quot;18 come from various hard Left groups: communists, Trotskyites, Maoists, and Castroists. Three others belong to the radical wing of the Labour Party. There are also eight radical Islamists. The remaining four are leftist ecologists known as Watermelons (Green outside, red inside).&quot; He points to a similar alliance of the French Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) and Workers&#x27; Struggle (LO) with radical Islamists. &quot;Are these not the new slaves?&quot; he quotes Olivier Besançonneau (who he describes as &quot;leader of the French Trotskyites&quot;), &quot;Is it not natural that they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system?&quot;

&quot;The European Marxist–Islamist coalition&quot;, argues Taheri, &quot;does not offer a coherent political platform. Its ideology is built around three themes: hatred of the United States, the dream of wiping Israel off the map, and the hoped-for collapse of the global economic system.&quot; Taheri also claims that the French Communist Party (PCF) &quot;commissioned a study of the possibilities of electoral alliances with Muslim organizations.&quot; He does not say that these Muslim organizations were Islamists or that anything ever came of the study.

Taheri clearly views this alliance with Islamists as compromising traditional humanist values of the left and all &quot;leftist&quot; values in general. He clearly implies that this coalition could go on to embrace terrorism, paraphrasing Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, the Venezuelan terrorist known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; to the effect that &quot;Islam is the only force capable of persuading large numbers of people to become &#x27;volunteers&#x27; for suicide attacks against the US&quot;, and directly quoting him, &quot;Only a coalition of Marxists and Islamists can destroy the US.&quot;

While many leftists have happily worked with &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Muslim&quot; groups in opposition to perceived U.S. or Israeli imperialism, alliances between leftists and &quot;Islamists&quot; are relatively unusual, and Taheri&#x27;s sole example of a leftist actually praising &quot;Islamist terrorists&quot; is from Carlos the Jackal, a terrorist himself. As discussed above, leftists widely condemned the September 11 attacks, although some differed from those to their right by contextualizing the attacks in terms of what they see as comparable or worse acts of imperialist violence. More typical examples of leftists working in anti-war coalitions with Muslims would be the membership of American Muslims for Jerusalem in UFPJ or of the Muslim Student Association, American Muslims for Global Peace, and Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam in ANSWER. These are Muslim groups, but they are not Islamist groups.

===Allegations of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism within the European anti-war movement===

Some allege that anti-American sentiments were expressed at most of these anti-war protests in Europe. Some rallies even turned into violent events, with attacks on police, shops and passers-by, such as the March 24, 2003 rally in Hamburg, Germany.

Some also allege that as Muslim minorities are bigger in many European countries than in the U.S., they influenced the movement. (5%–10% for France, 3.7% for Germany, 1.3% for Greece, according to the CIA World Factbook). There has been an organised Muslim component in many European anti-war rallies, reflecting widespread opposition to the American War on Terror campaign, often because of Arab/Muslim solidarity. In some groups, such as the British Stop the War Coalition, Muslims have taken leading positions. The presence of extremists and alleged Islamists has been cited by commentators such as Taheri in questioning the anti-war groups&#x27; commitment to human rights.

Anti-Israeli slogans and acts, allegedly most often chanted and committed by Islamists, have caused some to see anti-war rallies to be &quot;hijacked&quot; by them to become anti-Israeli, anti-Zionist and anti-Western events.

In France, Iraqi and Palestinian flags were common in anti-war rallies, while Israeli flags were often set on fire. In one case, the inflammatory atmosphere led to a serious case of violence: two Jewish teenagers, members of Hashomer Hatzair, were attacked in a demonstration in Paris against the war in Iraq. Aurélie Filippetti, a spokeswoman of the Green Party in Paris, was among the organizers of the demonstration. In an interview she gave Maariv correspondent Sefi Handler, she criticized some of her fellow French left-wingers for creating an anti-Israeli atmosphere which encourages antisemitism. She said:
I felt we should stop putting our head in the sand, saying that these are only fringe effects and therefore &#x27;none of our concern&#x27;, which leads us to just condemn them and do nothing more... They explained to me that the slogan &#x27;Bush and Sharon are murderers&#x27; is not antisemitism but anti-Zionism. But for me, when you burn the flag of Israel, it is antisemitism. The meaning is the delegitimation of Israel&#x27;s right to exist.

As a protest, Fillipetti promised to carry both flags of Israel and the Palestinians in the next demonstration as a message of peace and solidarity with Israel&#x27;s right to exist. As a result, she received threats and an urged meeting of the Green Party decided to forbid party activists to carry any national flag. Fillipetti honored the decision, but said that anti-war protests were still full with Iraq and Palestinian flags. &quot;It was a violent event&quot; she recalls. &quot;I said to myself that if I would carry the flags of Israel and Palestinian, I then would face some serious troubles.&quot;

Parallel to the controversy over the flags, Filipetti published an article in the left-oriented French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; in which she warned against the antisemitism that seemed to plague their own camp. It was an attack on her fellow leftists for turning a blind eye at what she characterized as the clearly anti-leftist character of some parts of their rallies and demonstrations. The article essentially accused certain members of the French left of being hypocrites (for allegedly tolerating the same kind of racist behavior that they were protesting against), and, as such, it came as a major shock and sparked much controversy.

Israeli left wing and Human rights activist, professor Amnon Rubinstein wrote that the French Left seems to hold a double standard: opposing neo-Nazism when it comes from the Western right wing (and particularly from the French Far Right, such as the Front National), but not when it comes from the &quot;oppressed world&quot; of the Arabs. He called that &quot;the big treason of the French Left, which came as a shock to the Jews who used to see the Left as their true friend&quot;. These accusations have generated great controversy, particularly because they come from within the Left itself.

However, a 2004 Pew poll showed that in Europe, favourability ratings are much higher for Jews than for Muslims.

<text>Benjamin Franklin Heintzleman (December 3, 1888 – June 24, 1965) was an American forester who spent much of his career supporting the development of Alaska Territory. Following a career with the United States Forest Service he was appointed Governor of Alaska Territory, a position he held from 1953 till 1957. During his term as governor he continued to support economic development but was largely opposed to efforts granting statehood to Alaska.

==Background==
Heintzleman was born to Andrew J. and Rebecca Jane Heintzleman in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania, on December 3, 1888. He was educated in public schools before being graduated from the Pennsylvania State College with a Bachelor of Forestry in 1907 and from Yale University with a Master of Forestry in 1910.

Shortly after graduation, Heintzleman joined the United States Forest Service and worked in Oregon and Washington. With the United States entry into World War I, he was transferred to Alaska to oversee lumber production. There, from 1918 till 1934, he served as Assistant Regional Forester in Ketchikan, Alaska. In this role he assisted the development of the region&#x27;s pulp and lumber industries and was key to the construction of two pulp mills in southeast Alaska. During this time he wrote the 1921 Forest Service bulletin &quot;The Forests of Alaska&quot;.

Heintzleman was made head of the National Recovery Administration forest conservation efforts in 1934. In 1937, he was appointed Alaskan Representative of the Federal Power Commission. The same year he was promoted to Regional Forester for Alaska, a post he held till 1953. As Regional Forester he also held the position of Alaskan Commissioner of the United States Department of Agriculture. In this role he encouraged the development of lumber and pulp mills along with other industrial development. From 1939 to 1940 he served as chairman of the Alaska Territorial Planning Board.

==Governorship==
Heintzleman was appointed to become Governor of Alaska Territory by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 11, 1953. Following confirmation, his term of office began on April 10 of the same year.

The primary focus of the new governor&#x27;s administration was economic development. Toward this end he called for revised homesteading and land laws along with updated mineral leases, power licenses, and timber contracts. The Alaskan governor also joined with Hawaiian Territorial Governor Samuel Wilder King in a call for a 25-year tax holiday to promote industrial development in the two territories. Finally, Heintzleman opposed the native claim of &quot;possessory rights&quot; to millions of acres of land, wishing to open the land to development. This opposition led to a prolonged battle in the United States Court of Claims.

Heintzleman submitted his resignation on December 18, 1956. His letter of resignation explain his departure by pointing out that he &quot;had forty-six years of public service&quot; and desired &quot;to retire to less strenuous work&quot;. The timing, three months before the end of his term, was occasioned by the outgoing governor&#x27;s desire to allow for his replacement to be in place before the next territorial legislature convened on January 28, 1957. Heintzleman&#x27;s resignation became effective on January 4, 1957, when Territorial Secretary became Acting Governor. A permanent replacement was not named until May 9, 1957, when President Eisenhower nominated Michael Anthony Stepovich.

===Opinion on statehood===
The leading political issue within Alaska at the time was the territory&#x27;s gaining statehood. Heintzleman&#x27;s opinion on the matter evolved over time. At the beginning of his term of office, he felt Alaska&#x27;s efforts to become a state were &quot;a little premature&quot;.

After a year, he revised his opinion and instead proposed that the territory be divided, with statehood for the most populous southern and eastern areas. Heintzleman laid out his plan in an April 3, 1954, letter to speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr., calling for a border to be drawn starting at the Alaska-Yukon border, following the Brooks Range and then the 152nd meridian west, until reaching the Gulf of Alaska, and veering into the Shelikof Strait so that Kodiak Island is included in the east. This eastern area, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Alaska Panhandle, would contain about 85% of the then-territory&#x27;s population, and according to Heintzleman should be granted statehood. Meanwhile, the north and west of Alaska, being largely unsettled, would remain a territory. The proposal to divide the territory was so unpopular among Alaskans that a petition drive was organized asking President Eisenhower to remove Heintzleman as governor.

By 1956, the Alaskan governor no longer opposed statehood and supported the creation of a state constitution. Heintzleman signed the bill establishing the Alaska Constitutional Convention.

==After office==
From 1957 till 1959, Heintzleman was a member of the University of Alaska Board of Regents. He then served, in 1960, as an advisor to the Alaska Rail and Highway Commission. Heintzleman died of a heart attack on June 24, 1965, in Juneau, Alaska. He was buried in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Heintzleman Ridge, a geographic feature north of Juneau, was named after him as a memorial in 1966.

<doc id="990000" wikidata="Q3312227" url="?curid=990000" title="Pelomyxa">
<text>Pelomyxa is a genus of giant flagellar amoebae, usually 500–800 μm but occasionally up to 5 mm in length, found in anaerobic or microaerobic bottom sediments of stagnant freshwater ponds or slow-moving streams.

The genus was created by R. Greeff, in 1874, with &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; as its type species. In the decades following the erection of &quot;Pelomyxa&quot;, researchers assigned numerous new species to it. However, in the last quarter of the 20th century, investigators reduced the genus to a single species, &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot;, which was understood to be a highly changeable organism with a complex life cycle, whose various phases had been mistaken for separate species. All described species were relegated to the status of synonyms, or moved to the unrelated genus &quot;Chaos&quot;.

Since 2004, four new &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; species have been described, and two older species have been redescribed and confirmed as valid members of the genus. These developments have raised new questions about the nature of &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; itself.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Pelomyxa&quot; have multiple nuclei, which can number from two to several thousand in rare cases. A moving cell is cylindrical in shape, with a single hemispherical pseudopod at the front and a semipermanent projection called a uroid at the back, which is covered in tiny non-motile flagella. They consume a wide variety of food, and have many vacuoles containing both food, such as diatoms, and debris such as sand. &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; are reliant on symbiotic bacteria that function similarly to the mitochondrion of aerobic creature, enabling the otherwise anaerobic species to live in more aerobic environments.

==Classification==
The classification of &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; has been the subject of considerable discussion, in recent decades.

&quot;Pelomyxa&quot; lack mitochondria, as well as several other organelles usually found in eukaryote cells (notably, peroxisomes and dictyosomes). At one time, they were also believed to lack flagella and to be incapable of mitosis. As nucleated cells that lacked &quot;nearly every other cell-inclusion of eukaryotes&quot;, &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; were, for a time, regarded as surviving &quot;proto-Eukaryotes&quot;, standing somewhere between the bacteria and the modern cell. In 1973, it was proposed that the ancestors of &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; had branched off from the eukaryote line before the advent of mitochondria In 1976, Jean M. Whatley wrote that &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; &quot;may justly be considered the most primitive eukaryotic organism living today.&quot; As such, the organism was potentially a modern analogue of the ancestral eukaryote that, according to the theory of serial endosymbiosis, internalized the bacterial symbiont that later evolved into the mitochondria of the modern cell. The species was known to host several bacterial symbionts. While the function of these was unclear, Whatley argued that they might provide a useful evolutionary example, indicating the &quot;ways in which a bacterial mitochondrial transformation might have been attained.&quot;

In 1982, Lynn Margulis created the subclass Caryoblastea (or Pelobiontidae) for &quot;anaerobic ameobas that lack undulipodia,&quot; and assigned &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; to it as the only member of the group. The following year, Cavalier-Smith included the genus with several other &quot;primitive&quot; amitochondriate amoeboids in a new taxonomical group: the Archamoebae. The Archamoebae were, in turn, recruited to the new kingdom of Archezoa, along with other amitochondriate eukaryotes, the Metamonads and the Microsporidia.

The primitivity of &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; came into doubt in 1988, when Joe I. Griffin published a structural study of &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; showing that the species does, after all, possess rudimentary flagella, and that it does mitose. Griffin concluded that &quot;&quot;Pelomyxa&quot; is neither primitive nor different from related forms, once it is realized that its relatives are amoeboid flagellates.&quot; In 1995, the case against &quot;Pelomyxa&quot;&#x27;s primitivity became stronger still, when molecular analysis revealed that the ancestors of &quot;Pelomyxa palustris&quot; had most probably possessed mitochondria. By the end of the decade, it was clear that all members of Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s Archamoebae were descended from mitochondriate cells. In other words, they were not early-branching or &quot;primitive&quot; eukaryotes at all, but rather &quot;degenerate protists&quot; that had lost organelles their ancestors had possessed.

Consequently, &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; and the other Archamoeba were reassigned to the phylum Amoebozoa, under the subphylum Conosa (shared with the Mycetozoan slime moulds). Kingdom Archezoa was eliminated.

<doc id="990005" wikidata="Q2842506" url="?curid=990005" title="Figure It Out">
<text>Figure It Out is an American children&#x27;s panel game show that aired on Nickelodeon. The original series, hosted by Summer Sanders, ran for four seasons from July 7, 1997, to December 12, 1999. The show was revived in 2012, with Jeff Sutphen as host, with the revival airing from June 11, 2012, to July 16, 2013. The series was originally recorded at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. The revival episodes were filmed on stage 19 at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles.

Children with special skills or unique achievements compete as contestants on the show while a panel of four Nickelodeon celebrities try to guess the predetermined phrase that describes the contestant&#x27;s talent. The series is a loose adaptation of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, both established panel shows created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman.

Shortly after the series aired its last first-run episode, &quot;Figure It Out&quot; began airing repeats on Nick GAS until the network ceased at the end of 2007 (2009 on Dish Network). Several episodes of the Sanders-hosted series also aired in 2012 as part of The &#x27;90s Are All That, a 1990s-oriented rerun block that aired on TeenNick.

==Gameplay==
Each episode has two sets of three timed rounds (originally all 60 seconds in length, for the revival series, rounds two and three were played for 45 seconds), in which the panel takes turns asking yes-or-no questions to try to guess the contestant&#x27;s talent. For every &quot;yes&quot; answer, the panelist&#x27;s turn continues. Once a panelist asks a question with a &quot;no&quot; answer, their turn ends and the next panelist&#x27;s turn starts. If at any time a panelist cannot think of a question on their turn, they may pass their turn to the next panelist. Each time a panelist mentions a word that is part of the phrase that describes the secret talent, the word is turned over on a game board displaying the puzzle. This game board was referred to as Billy the Answer Head during the original series run and is known simply as the &quot;It&quot; Board in the show&#x27;s later adaptation.

This game board shows which words of the phrase are guessed, along with blanks denoting words that the panel did not solve. Prepositions and articles, such as &quot;of&quot; and &quot;an,&quot; are provided automatically. During the very early episodes of the show, synonyms of words that were on the board were accepted by the judges (e.g.: A panelist revealing the word &quot;song&quot; by saying the word &quot;carol&quot; and another episode featured a panelist revealing the word &quot;tossing&quot; by saying the word &quot;throw&quot;). This was later changed to a panelist having to say the exact word in a contestant&#x27;s talent in order for that word to be revealed on the board.

The contestant wins a prize after each round that their talent remains unguessed. The prize for winning the third round is a trip. In Season 1, prizes consisted mainly of leftover props from then-defunct Nickelodeon shows such as &quot;Double Dare,&quot; &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; and &quot;Global Guts.&quot; Merchandise prizes (such as a Nintendo 64) and gift cards for stores including Kids Foot Locker, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and Loew&#x27;s began to appear as prizes during later seasons. If Round 3 ends with at least one word left unrevealed, each panelist takes one final guess as to what the contestant&#x27;s talent is (any correct words given during the final guess are revealed, as during the game). The game ends when a panelist either guesses the secret talent or if no panelist guesses the secret talent correctly after the &quot;last guess&quot; stage.

During each Round, the panelists receive one clue as a hint to one of the words of the secret phrase. The clue usually takes the form of physical objects - such as dates to indicate a clue about calendars - sounds (rarely used), the clue-cano (seasons 4-6), featured messy clues erupting out of the clue boxes all over the panel, making them just as messy as a sliming, especially in the Sutphen era which made the panel cautious when opening the clue boxes or pantomime (the &quot;Charade Brigade&quot; (Season 1-4), &quot;Clue Force 3&quot; (Seasons 5-6), usually two or three cast members that act out a word from the phrase during Round 3) with &quot;Clue Force 3&quot; pictionary was sometimes used instead of pantomime. At the start of the second and third rounds, a recap of two or three clues are shown on the monitor next to the contestant and host.

At the end of the game, after the secret talent is revealed, the contestant demonstrates or displays their skill and discusses it with the host and panel.

===Secret Slime Action===
In each game, from the start of round 2, a randomly selected member of the studio audience plays for a prize (a merchandise prize, such as a Nintendo 64 or a mountain bike in season 1 or a &quot;Figure It Out&quot;-branded article of clothing in seasons 2-6). If at least one or more panelists perform the Secret Slime Action, those panelists will be slimed by the end of round 3 especially when one of the panelists tries to break the rules and get a second chance (during season 1, the secret slime action could be triggered anytime after the end of round 1, including between rounds and when the contestant is performing their secret) and the audience member wins that prize. &quot;J&quot;, the regular announcer for the original show, would disclose what the Secret Slime Action was for each episode in which he appeared.

The action designated as the Secret Slime Action is typically simple and almost guaranteed: touching a clue, looking to the left, which was reflexive, as clues were commonly wheeled out on a small track from a tunnel to the panel&#x27;s left; using the phrase &quot;Are you...&quot; or &quot;Is it...&quot;, looking to the audience behind the panel, who was sometimes used for clues, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; which panelist Danny Tamberelli was notable for saying out loud whenever he got confused, having a certain name, and even &quot;being&quot; a panelist. For example, Steve Burns (from &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;) was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was &quot;having a blue dog,&quot; Alex Heartman (from &quot;Power Rangers Samurai&quot;) was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was &quot;wearing a red unitard to work&quot;, Jade Ramsey (from &quot;House of Anubis&quot;) was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was &quot;having an identical twin sister&quot;, Ryan Potter (from &quot;Supah Ninjas&quot;) was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was &quot;being a supah ninja&quot;, and in the second game of the first episode of the 2012 Revival, the entire panel was slimed because the Secret Slime Action was &quot;wearing underwear&quot;.

Some Actions are logically not able to be forced, such as &quot;thinking about coconuts&quot; or &quot;thinking about mushroom soup.&quot; Especially in the latter seasons, a successful Action has mostly been a foregone conclusion - the variables have only been when it will be triggered, and by whom (not necessarily a panelist).

When the Secret Slime Action is triggered, all play stops (including the clock) while the panelist is slimed, the action is revealed, and a replay of the sliming is shown, after which gameplay resumes. The host knows of the action and sometimes tricks the panelists into performing it by making them say or touch something (in one episode, the action was &quot;touching your head.&quot; Sanders touched her head and said, &quot;Have you done something with your hair?,&quot; which caused the panel to touch their heads in reaction).

====Word of Honor====
In the 2012 revival, prior to each game, one word of either the first or second contestant&#x27;s secrets may be designated as the &quot;Word of Honor.&quot; Should the panel guess this word, the contestant is slimed. As the contestant is slimed, gameplay and the clock are paused. Once the Word of Honor was revealed, either by a panel guess or the contestant filling in unguessed words, it would be out of play for the rest of the show.

==Panelists==
Either three or all four panelists are taken from Nickelodeon shows airing at the time. Regulars during the original run included &quot;All That&quot; cast members Amanda Bynes, Lori Beth Denberg, Kevin Kopelow and Danny Tamberelli (who also starred in the Nickelodeon program &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;). Bynes (occasionally), Kopelow and Tamberelli were notorious for frequently asking silly questions and acting goofy, while Denberg was the serious panelist, who asked well-thought out questions, and frequently was the one to guess the secret phrase, during the final guesses. The only four panelists who appeared on every season of the original run of the show were Kopelow, Bynes, Tamberelli, and Irene Ng (from &quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot;).

The first seat on the panel was usually reserved for an adult panelist, either an adult actor from a Nickelodeon program (usually Kopelow) or a non-Nickelodeon celebrity (such as Taran Noah Smith of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;). In several episodes, CatDog, rendered in CGI, and Cousin Skeeter, a puppet character, were panelists. In Seasons 5 and 6, the first seat was not reserved for an adult, but Matt Bennett from &quot;Victorious&quot; and Ciara Bravo from &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; regularly appeared in the first position. Other guest panelists included Coolio, Colin Mochrie (regular on &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;), and professional wrestlers Chris Jericho, The Giant and &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan.

In one episode of the second season, for the first half, Lori Beth Denberg hosted the show and Summer Sanders was in her place as a panelist.

==Production==
Production on the original version of &quot;Figure It Out&quot; started on March 24, 1997, and ended a month later, at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, with a planned 40-episode order.

In 2013, Sutphen confirmed via Twitter that no new episodes of the revival of &quot;Figure It Out&quot; would be produced.

==Format changes==

* Season 3 (fall 1998) — The series became &quot;Figure It Out: Family Style,&quot; featuring two or three contestants who were related, typically parent-child or siblings. Sometimes on the 2nd half, the panel can have a family member of the contestant. Sometimes, the Charade Brigade can have family members of the panelists and the host. &quot;Figure It Out: Family Style&quot; also features Little Billy. If the panelists figured out the contestants&#x27; secret, then Little Billy (a miniature version of Billy the Answer Head with hair and on wheels) would come out. Summer reads a question about the family&#x27;s talent and then each panelist will try to guess one (impossible) answer. If they cannot figure it out (no panel ever did since they simply treated it as a free-for-all most times by guessing answers intended for comedic response), then the answer in Little Billy would reveal and which gives the family another chance to win a prize (usually the &quot;Figure It Out&quot; apparel used for the Secret Slime Action Rounds). For certain episodes, J&#x27;s mother, Joanne Dumas filled in as the show&#x27;s announcer.
* Season 4 (fall 1999) — The show was re-titled &quot;Figure It Out: Wild Style&quot; and focused solely on talents involving animals; in addition, Billy the Answer Head was reshaped into various animals. During these episodes, the panelists went wild with hair, wigs and make-up, sporting a different, distinctive look. Sometimes, instead of J himself doing the narration work, some episodes would instead be narrated by J&#x27;s dog. This is the only &quot;Figure It Out&quot; season that does not include Lori Beth Denberg, as she had moved on to work on &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;. During these episodes, seven different panelists such as Steve Burns, Shane Sweet, Erin J. Dean, Christy Knowings, Irene Ng, Kevin Kopelow and Kareem Blackwell permanently replaced Denberg in the chair she always sat in. This season also featured recurring panelist appearances from legendary animal expert and TV personality, &quot;Jungle&quot; Jack Hanna, who would be holding an animal in the first half, before having the animal taken backstage so he had a chance to be slimed with the rest of the panelists.
* Season 5 (summer 2012) — The show reverted to its original title and Jeff Sutphen took over as host. Elle Young took over as the announcer. The set, host, panelists, theme music and logo were all modified to serve Nickelodeon&#x27;s contemporary audience. Gameplay was also slightly modified to include the Word of Honor component and to shorten the lengths of rounds two and three (originally, all rounds were 60 seconds; in the newer version, rounds two and three are 45 seconds). Also, Billy the Answer Head was changed to the &quot;It Board,&quot; the Clue Express was renamed the &quot;Clue Coaster&quot; and the Charade Brigade was changed to &quot;Clue Force III&quot; featuring Lorenz Arnell, Gevorg Manoukian and Julia Srednicki. 
* Season 6 (fall 2012 and summer 2013) — The show was brought back after the long gap in the summer. The style of the show stays the same, but with some changes, such as a fifth seat and slime spewer added to the panel desk for the child panelist who won a summer contest to appear for one entire episode (the fifth panel desk was gone before and after the winning child&#x27;s episode).

== Famous contestants ==
On April 7, 1998, future country music singer/songwriter Hunter Hayes was a contestant on &quot;Figure It Out&quot; when he was six years old. His talent was playing the accordion and singing.

Sam Roberts, Podcaster, WWE Personality, and host of &quot;Jim Norton &amp; Sam Roberts&quot; on Sirius XM, appeared on an episode in Season 2. His talent was flipping quarters off his ankle.

Marcus Stroman of the New York Yankees was a prize winner in episode 13 of Season 1.

Gentry Haukebo, Albuquerque rap artist better known as 1oK, was a contestant and prize winner in an episode during the show&#x27;s fifth season. Her talent was being a shovel racing champion.

Julia Srednicki, character designer for &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot;, was a member of the &quot;Clue Force 3&quot; during the final two seasons hosted by Jeff Sutphen.

<doc id="990012" wikidata="Q608490" url="?curid=990012" title="Music of Namibia">
<text>The music of [[Namibia]] includes a number of folk styles, as well as pop, rock, reggae, jazz, house and hip hop.

The Sanlam-NBC Music Awards and the Namibian Music Awards are two separate institutions that give out annual awards at shows on December 2 and May 6 respectively. The Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) has helped promote Namibian music within and outside the country.

The Namibian music industry remains under-developed, with no major record labels or distribution infrastructure. A lack of focus to produce economically viable Namibian music products and the absence of effective marketing and distribution structures are two of the factors inherently hampering the development of the local music industry.The country&#x27;s online music retailer, DONLU offers streaming services.

==Folk music==
Traditional Namibian dances occur at events such as weddings and at traditional festivals such as the Caprivi Arts Festival. Folk music accompanies storytelling or dancing. The Nama people use various strings, flutes and drums while the Bantu use xylophones, gourds and horn trumpets.
* The Herero people&#x27;s &quot;oviritje&quot; is popularly known as &quot;konsert&quot;. Otjiherero is the primary language of Oviritje music. Oviritje was made popular by Kareke Henguva as a pioneer of Modern Oviritje Music when he together with the likes of Kakazona Kavari, Meisie Henguva and Oomzulu Pietersen introduced the keyboard element as prior to the introduction of the keyboard Oviritje Music was performed with vocals only. Prior to Kareke people like Matuarari Kaakunga and Bella Kazongominja have developed the Oviritje genre. Today in recognition of his contribution to the Oviritje music Kareke Henguva has been accorded the title of doctor of modern Oviritje music. Other groups that took over from Henguva and made this music popular are &quot;The Wild Dogs&quot; from the Okakarara area with their hit song &quot;Kaondeka&quot;, &quot;Okazera&quot; from the Omaheke Region, the first group to include a San-speaking member, Bullet ya Kaoko, based in Opuwo in the Kunene Region, Tuponda, Katja, Millenium, Kareke and the United Kingdom-based Oviritje queen Kakazona ua Kavari.
* Maǀgaisa, a dance music genre commonly known as Damara Punch, is performed by Stanley, ǃAubasen, Dixson and Damara Dikding. Phura Duwe is known to be the king of Ma/gaisa as he came up this genre of music then follows the likes of Raphael and Pele, Pule, Ruby and Riio.
Many female singers are entering the Ma/gaisa world yearly. The genre was derived from Damara traditional music and is mainly sung in Khoekhoegowab.
* Shambo, the traditional dance music of the Oshiwambo-speaking people, derives its name from &quot;Shambo Shakambode&quot; - &quot;music&quot;. In the late nineties Yoba Valombola blended existing Oshiwambo music widely popularised by folk guitarist Kwela, Kangwe Keenyala, Boetie Simon, Lexington and Meme Nanghili na Shima. Later Setson and the Mighty Dread Band combined these and other Namibian styles and this was the birth of Shambo shakambode music. Yoba based Shambo on a dominant guitar, a rhythm guitar, percussion and a heavy &quot;talking&quot; bassline. Themes range from love to war and history. Young Namibian musicians contributed sampled tracks backed by a blend of house music and Kwaito. Prominent shambo musicians include Tunakie, Ama Daz Floor, Tate Kwela and D-Naff, also a gospel musician. Kwiku mixes shambo with Kwassa kwassa. The genre was made popular by Tate Buti and his sister Janice with Faizel MC on the song &quot;Kwiku&quot;. It is listened to by most Namibians including Basters and Coloureds. In 2005 it was recognized by the Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) as one of Namibia&#x27;s folk music genres. The annual Sanlam-NBC Music Awards also included it as one of their awarding genres in 2005. Other kwiku artists include trio PDK, Olavi, Killa B, Castro, Faizel MC, Tunakie, and the late YT de Wet.
* Afrikaans music is also popular in Namibia. Afrikaans music primarily influenced by European folk music. In Namibia it is more popular among the white communities. Stefan Ludik is the most successful Afrikaans musician.

==Popular music==
Popular styles of music in Namibia include hip hop, R&amp;B, Soul, reggae, afro-pop, house and kwaito. Upon Namibia&#x27;s independence Jackson Kaujeua and Ras Sheehama had been the most outstanding Namibian performers. Kaujeua had been performing since the 1970s, he performed a mix of Namibia&#x27;s traditional genres with afro-pop/gospel sounds. Sheehama performs reggae, in footsteps of reggae late legends Bob Marley and Lucky Dube. Sheehama has performed in Jamaica, Cuba, UK, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Other early Namibian musicians includes a Setswana band called People&#x27;s Choice, that was popular between 1996 and 1998 for their hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back (Siwelewele)&quot;, a kwaito trio called Matongo Family, Boli Mootseng, X-Plode with members (Jaicee James, Lizell Swarts &amp; Christi Nomath Warner Warner Christi), oshiwambo indigenous rapper Shikololo and R&amp;B turn-producer Big Ben. Big Ben has eventually become the most respected artist through his Afro pop and Fusion with his live shows. In fact he is one of the very few that performs all his shows with a live band while many still performs with back tracks. Namibian stars such as Stefan Ludik, The Dogg, Gazza, Gal Level, EES, Lady May, Sunny Boy and Big Ben have become continental celebrities as well as Placa Gang a group of hard working dream chasers.

===Reggae/Dancehall/Afrobeats===

The Namibian reggae platform has produced artist such as Ras Sheehama, Petu, Ngatu, who has been performing since 1994, Mighty Dreeds and EES. In the early eighties a band called We Culture was formed in Katutura and this turned to be Namibia&#x27;s first reggae band. Another band followed called Roots rebels also based in the Katutura location. The Namibian independence came and most of the Namibian population that was in exile came back to Namibian and bands like Young Dreads later renamed as Mighty Dreads, Ras Sheehama, Los Amadeus, Omidi d Afrique, Shem Yetu, Organised Crime and 40Thieves. Most of these bands faded or became one and a group of young Namibian reggae musicians came up later. Most of the Mighty Dread band members left and formed Formular band or engage into solo careers. Dancehall, Ragga and Dub was gaining popularity and singers like Ngatu (from the Mighty Dread), Doren, Iron Roots, Ras Kasera and Ten-Dreadz came up with a new blend of Ragga Dancehall. EES is also respected in the R&amp;B, hip hop and kwaito genres of Namibia. Buju Bantuan a.k.a. Katjoko (not to be confused with Jamaica&#x27;s Buju Banton), the late La Chox and Kamasutra are one of the youngest reggae artist. Prominent kwaito artist Gazza has also associated himself with the genre as well as Killa-B

===Rock n roll===
Rock n roll is widely celebrated by the white communities of Namibia. Die Vögel is one of Namibia&#x27;s most outstanding rock n roll bands. The band had success with the German-speaking Namibians during the 1970s. Stefan Ludik was Namibia&#x27;s first &quot;Big Brother Africa&quot; participant in the show&#x27;s first season. Today he is a successful rock n roll and pop musician and actor. His music is more popular among the Namibian and South African white communities. G3 a duo of two young Namibians gained success with their hit single &quot;Olupandu&quot; in 2005.
One of the country&#x27;s most durable rock bands is Bedrock (The Band In The Sand). Formed in 1994 in Oranjemund, the band has released four albums of original material over the years: Recovery (2001), So, Where&#x27;s The Party? (2003), Simplicity (2008) and Desert Rock (2010). They describe their sound as Desert Rock, an eclectic mix of styles from 1970s rock, blues, pop and folk. A feature of their compositions is the subtle thread of humour which underpins most of their work. The opening song of their debut album, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll, was voted by the South African Rock Digest as one of the Top 30 South African songs of 2003. It was also their first song to gain radio play. Despite numerous personnel changes over the years the band continues to thrive, playing regular gigs in and around Oranjemund.

===Township Disco / Bubblegum===

He won the coveted Best Male Artist at the Namibian Annual Music Awards (2011) becoming the first Hip Hop artist to do so. After establishing Ghetto Child, his own record label, he rose to fame with the release of his debut studio album, &quot;Check Who&#x27;s Back&quot; (2006). Gawanab, professionally known as Jericho, continued his success by releasing studio albums which include: &quot;Lights Out&quot; (2007); &quot;Street Fame&quot; (2010); &quot;Let Me Be Me&quot; (2014) which features major South African rapper Cassper Nyovest and the legendary Hip Hop Pantsula; &quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Recovery&quot; (2020).

Early Namibian hip hop acts includes a group called Dungeon Family, which was composed of the newly recreated group The Kalaharians and the popular girl duo Gal Level. Other acts include Nakuni Heitah, Gurd Grill, OmPuff, Black Vulcanite and Mc Ray.

Namibian hip-hop can compete with kwaito for popularity.

===R&amp;B, pop, afro-pop===
R&amp;B has been popular in Namibia since the 1990s. Namibian R&amp;B singers have influenced the genre with afro-pop. Most of them perform a mixture of pop/afro-pop and R&amp;B. Afro-pop is the African style of wester-pop. The Namibian R&amp;B/pop genre has produced continental celebrated duo Gal Level and solo singers African Boy, Sally Boss Madam, Christi Nomath Warner Warner Christi (who uses her poetry as basis for her lyrics) &amp; Lady May. Te Quila, Jewelz and Sally Boss Madam are one of the most promising R&amp;B/pop singers of Namibia. Male artist such as Rodger and Nasti are also popular they all show influence from Ne-Yo, Mario, and Chris Brown. Jossy Joss and Big Ben are one of the earliest singers of Namibia. Big Ben has been the most consistent with this genre since his first release in 2001.

===Kwaito===

The kwaito genre is the most popular and successful music genre in Namibia. It&#x27;s believed to be the biggest industry in Namibia&#x27;s music and the only that is heavily supported by the youth. This is so because of socio-economic issues, as many artists enter the music industry with hopes of strengthening self-employment and making a living out of it. Namibian kwaito has been strengthened and directly influenced by the South African kwaito style. However, over the years Namibia introduced a different type of kwaito, which makes it slightly different from the South African tradition. The difference lies in production; Namibian producers focus their production on party-oriented music.

Namibian kwaito artists include The Dogg, Gazza, Sunny Boy, Qonja, Tre Van Die Kasie, and OmPuff. The Dogg&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Shimaliw&#x27; Osatana&quot;, was the first kwaito album released in Namibia by a Namibian artist.

===House===
House music is played at raves in Africa, especially South Africa. African house is based on African traditional melodies. It is characterized by a fast moving beat with thin melodies and synthesizers. Sometimes it is accompanied by vocals.

===Metal===
Since the late 1990s some artists perform heavy metal in Namibia, among those the Arcana XXII, subMission, Delusion Of Grandeur, ScatterSoul.
In 2007 the first Namibian festival took place with bands like CfD (USA), subMission (Namibia), Wrust (Botswana), Neblina (Angola), Delusion Of Grandeur (Namibia), followed by two other editions in 2008 and 2009 including artists like Lady Axe (South Africa), Juggernaught (South Africa), Azrail (South Africa).

===Electronic music===
In the late nineties an ex Mighty Dread singer (Yoba Valombola, known as Benga), bassist and guitarist came back from Germany with a big influence and eager in change and started an independent label called Big Rat Communication. This was fuelled by the idea of producing Namibia&#x27;s first electronic music ranging from, Trip hop, Drum and bass, Dubstep and drumstep. Due to the unpopularity of electronic music in Namibia, Yoba released his music only in Europe and America under the name Benga. Most of the electronic music Benga release is based on his early experiments of Reggae, Shambo, blues and rock. Yoba went back to the west and returned again after six years to Namibia to influence other Namibians. Some existing experimental artists like Thomas Swarts, Dtubsen and Joas tried forming a group and due to time and obligations, nothing worked out. Yoba is still based in Germany as an electronic artist and performing with other Namibian artists in Europe: widely as Canada and South America.

<text>John Weir Troy (October 31, 1868 — May 2, 1942) was an American Democratic politician who was the Governor of Alaska Territory from 1933 to 1939. He was born in Dungeness, Washington and died in Juneau, Alaska.

John Troy began his professional career in journalism, starting as a newspaper reporter in Port Townsend, Washington, shortly after graduating from high school there. He would publish newspapers in Washington and Alaska
between 1891 and 1914. He was the editor of &quot;Alaska-Yukon Magazine&quot; from 1911 to 1912. Following this, he was the editor of the &quot;Daily Alaskan Empire&quot; for twenty years before being appointed governor in 1933.

He was the father-in-law of George A. Lingo, who was the second husband of his younger daughter, Dorothy Minerva. At the time of their marriage, Lingo was a member of the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives and the board of trustees of the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines.

<text>The Sharp PC-1403 was a small scientific calculator and pocket computer manufactured by Sharp. It was the successor of the Sharp PC-1401, and had better display, more RAM and better system software.

==Technical specifications==
* CPU: Hitachi SC61860 (8-bit CMOS) 768 kHz
* Memory: 8 KB RAM (6863 bytes available), 72 KB ROM; 32 KB RAM in PC-1403H model
* Display: Monochrome LCD 1 line with 24 5×7 characters
* Power: 6 V DC - 2× CR2032, 0.03 W
* Connector (11 pins) for external devices
* Integrated speaker (4 kHz beep only)
* Contrast adjustment wheel
* Software: Simple BASIC interpreter; calculator mode
* Matrix calculations

Manufacturing started in 1986.

It is possible to convert the 1403 to a 1403H by removing the 8 K RAM and soldering in a 32 K RAM. An inverter IC is needed for this, too.

==Calculator==
Calculations could be performed in two modes &quot;CAL&quot; and &quot;RUN&quot;. In the former, the PC-1403 would behave like a normal scientific calculator at the time with formulas entered in algebraic logic. In &quot;RUN&quot; mode, BASIC statements could be entered for immediate execution and print out. The latter was similar to the Direct algebraic logic employed by modern calculators.

==Programming==
The programming model employed was unstructured BASIC for which the PC-1403 distinguished between &quot;RUN&quot; and &quot;PRO&quot; mode. The later being used to enter and edit program and the former being used to execute them. 

===Programming example===
Here is a sample program that computes the factorial of an integer number from 0 to 69. It can be called by entering a number or an expression followed by pressing codice_1 codice_2 (in run mode).

10 &quot;F&quot; AREAD N &quot;allows to start the program with &lt;expression&gt; DEF F
20 F=1 &quot;Set start value of F to 1
30 FOR I=1 TO N &quot;counts I from 1 to N
40 F=F*I &quot;calculates F=F*I
50 NEXT I &quot;repeats loop from line 40
60 PRINT STR$ N+&quot;!=&quot;;F &quot;print result - i.e. 5!=120.
70 END &quot;end of program
===Machine language programming===
It is possible to write machine language programs into memory using the POKE command and starting them with the CALL command.

<text>An aquarist is a person who manages aquariums, either professionally or as a hobby. They typically care for aquatic animals, including fish and marine invertebrates. Some may care for aquatic mammals. Aquarists often work at public aquariums. They may also work at nature reserves, zoos, and amusement parks. Some aquarists conduct field research outdoors. In business, aquarists may work at pet stores, as commercial fish breeders, or as manufacturers. Some aquarists are hobbyists, also known as &quot;home aquarists,&quot; who may vary in skills and experience.

== History ==
People have cared for aquatic animals since ancient times. The Sumerians kept fish in ponds as early as 2500 BCE. Pliny the Elder wrote of people who kept fish as oracles, and ancient Agrigent was believed to have fish ponds. The Roman poet Rutilus Namatianus wrote of a Etrurian Jew who kept fish in opaque tanks. By the 10th century, goldfish were popular pets in China. In 1369, Emperor Hung Wu established a porcelain factory to produce large tubs for fish. Around 1500, goldfish came to Sakai, Japan. Two hundred years later, Sato Sanzaemon, from Koriyama, became the first Japanese fish breeder, and fish breeding became popular throughout Japan. Around 1611, goldfish came to Europe, probably first in Portugal. By the 18th century, goldfish were common pets in Europe. During this time, Richard Bradley, an English botanist, and John Dayell, a Scottish naturalist, experimented with keeping marine life. In particular, scientists tried to determine if marine life could survive in captivity, as they usually died shortly after being removed from their natural environments.

For centuries, humans had limited exposure to aquatic life. The sea was often considered mysterious. As written by Bernd Brunner in &quot;The Ocean at home&quot;, &quot;The ocean was considered a source of life but also a place of ill omen, death, and mayhem—a cursed, dark world where terrifying monsters lurked, devouring anything in sight.&quot; Yet, in the 19th century, railroad transportation was introduced, enabling more people to visit coastal regions. During this period, scientists focused on analyzing the chemical and physical properties of aquatic environments, such as water temperature and salt content. Ocean exploration also became more common, as telegraph cables were installed underwater, diving bells and early submarines were invented, and deep sea explorations began with the help of dredgers. One of the most famous oceanic expeditions of the period was the four year journey of HMS Challenger, led by Sir Charles Wyville Thomson, which visited 363 locations.

In 1830, Jeanne Villepreux-Power conducted research on argonauts in Messina, Italy. According to Richard Owen, director of the British Museum, Villepreux-Power invented the first aquarium through these experiments. That same year, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward discovered that delicate plants could grow in airtight glass, as the glass created a microclimate. Around 1838, Felix Dujardin, a French zoologist, owned a saltwater aquarium. In 1846, Anna Thyne moved stone corals from Torquay to her home in London, later keeping them in her home in glass bowls. She experimented with water changes to sustain the corals, and she was able to keep the corals alive for three years. In 1849, Robert Warrington created a 13-gallon tank with springwater and goldfish. He published his findings related to oxygen and lighting in &quot;Chemical Society&#x27;s Journal&quot;. In 1854, &quot;The Aquarium&quot;, by Philip Henry Gosse, was published, which was a commercial success and inspired middle-class families to create aquariums. The book provided information on how to build aquariums with aquatic plants, fish, hermit crabs, shrimp, sea anemone, aphrodita, and other aquatic life. During this period, William Alford Lloyd sold aquariums at his shop in London, which also provided aquarium maintenance services to customers. In 1856, Emil Adolf Rossmässler wrote about setting up freshwater aquariums as a &quot;small botanical garden island&quot; with animals such as snails, pearl mussels, and goldfish in &quot;Die Gartenlaube.&quot; These freshwater aquariums were appealing for people who lived farther from the sea.

While the &quot;aquarium mania&quot; of the 1850s lost popularity after a few years, public aquariums were soon established. In 1853, the &quot;fish house&quot; was opened at the London Zoo. In 1860, Gustav Jager, a German nature scientist and doctor, built an aquarium in Vienna, Austria. Major cities continued to open aquariums in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the New York Aquarium (1896) and Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit (1904). Early aquariums cared little for conservation of endangered species, and they often contributed to marine degradation. However, conservation efforts began in the 20th century, such as the conservation of the Galápagos tortoises led by Charles Haskins Townsend. Contemporary aquariums are now often involved in conservation and field research. In 2019, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; reported that &quot;the United States is experiencing a new wave of aquarium enthusiasm,&quot; but that public aquariums often experience financial difficulty.

== Responsibilities ==

Responsibilities for aquarists often include maintaining and cleaning tanks, preparing food for the animals (including dietary adjustments), feeding the animals, providing mental stimulation for some animals, monitoring animals for sickness or injuries, administering medication and vitamins to animals, maintaining the water quality and water temperature of tanks, maintaining the lighting of tanks, collecting data on the water quality and water temperature of tanks, monitoring and maintaining aquarium machinery (such as filters, heaters, and pumps), transporting animals, and building exhibits, among other duties. It is common for aquarists to have scuba diving certification.

<text>Turoa (or Tūroa) is a skifield on the south western side of Mount Ruapehu, the highest mountain in the North Island of New Zealand, in Tongariro National Park. The area has been used for skiing since before the completion of the Mountain Road; however, the first lifts opened in 1978. Turoa was owned by Ruapehu Alpine Lifts from 2000, a company that also owned the nearby Whakapapa skifield, also on Mt. Ruapehu. After liquidation of Ruapehu Alpine Lifts in 2023, the field was purchased by Pure Turoa. The field has been operated by Pure Turoa since April 2024. 

== Features ==
There are two beginner areas, and many intermediate and advanced trails. The upper field is a mix of natural pipes, steep drops, fast plains, and easier slopes, along with several terrain parks. The lower field contains the field&#x27;s single narrow beginner trail, Clarry&#x27;s Track, and a few other intermediate trails. They also serve as access to the base area from the upper mountain, and are often crowded. The field is and has about a vertical drop from the top chair to the skifield base.

On a good day, it is possible to hike to the top of the mountain with skis or snowboard in hand, view the Crater Lake, and then ski back down to the field, or to Whakapapa. Also on a clear day Mount Taranaki can be seen.

== Access ==
The skifield is reached via the Mountain Road from the town of Ohakune. The Mountain Road was built by locals from Ohakune, mostly during weekends after they formed the Mountain Road Association in 1952. Their aim was to open Ruapehu&#x27;s southern slopes for skiing, partly as a replacement industry for the decline in logging which had sustained the town for the previous decades. The now renamed Ministry of Works helped with the road on one occasion by &#x27;misplacing&#x27; a culvert destined for another roading project. The 17 kilometre road was opened in 1963, reached Turoa by 1967 and became a legal road in 1973. It winds up through spectacular native forest before breaking out above the tree line and finishes at a complex of carparks below the bottom chairlift.

== History ==
In 1995, skiers were evacuated from the skifield when a small volcanic eruption occurred at the crater lake, ejecting rocks, ash and steam.

In 2007, a high speed six-seater chairlift, the High Noon Express was installed, replacing an existing T-bar to the top of the skifield. The lift had several faults after being installed, such as cable derailments. In winter of 2010, two pylons on the lift collapsed, and the lift was redesigned with 15 new shorter pylons instead of 10 higher pylons in the original design and was open 2011 season. The redesign required relocating an older fixed grip quad chair which previously passed under the lift.

There was an accidental diesel spill in 2013 and after this the number of tanks and total storage was reduced. 

=== Ruapehu Alpine Lifts ===
In 2022 following a poor snow season attributed largely to climate change, Ruapehu Alpine Lifts, the parent company of both Whakapapa and Turoa skifields, entered voluntary administration in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy. The company is a not-for-profit business that was established by members of ski clubs in 1953. In August 2022, Ruapehu Alpine Lifts laid off 130 workers and its total debt climbed to over NZ$30 million. The financial situation of Ruapehu Alpine Lifts deteriorated rapidly following disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts to secure additional funds from investors or the New Zealand government initially failed.

However, in December 2022, the government provided a $6 million loan to Ruapehu Alpine Lifts, to help ensure that both Ruapehu skifields could operate in winter 2023. This was in addition to $15 million provided in 2018 from the Provincial Growth Fund.

=== Pure Turoa ===
After the liquidation of Ruapehu Alpine Lifts in 2023, the ski area was purchased by Pure Turoa in March 2024. A ten year Department of Conservation concession was obtained by May 2024, and the ski area reopened for the 2024 season in June.

The concession required that the Nga Wai Heke quad chairlift was removed. The concession granting process was later identified as having flawed engagement with the Iwi. An outstanding issue is if managed retreat in relation to skifield activities is appropriate. 

As of 2023 the Tūroa and Whakapapa Ski Areas on Mount Ruapehu were the only commercial ski areas within the North Island of New Zealand.

==Lifts==
There are three proposed ski lifts at Turoa, which are due to be complete before 2030. A new Quad express set to be positioned west of the high noon express, to give better access to where the old Jumbo T-Bar used to operate near. The existing Giant fixed grip chairlift is set to be replaced by a new detachable quad express. A gondola is planned to be constructed on Turoa, replacing both the Parklane and Movenpick chairs, starting at the base area and terminating at the location of the top station of the Movenpick chair with a mid station allowing for access to the Wintergarden beginners area.

The comfortable capacity of the skifield as of 2023 was 4,800 skiers per day, having been higher in the past and after proposed upgrades will reduce to 4,500 skiers per day.

<text>The Sharp PC-1500 was a pocket computer produced by Sharp between 1981 and 1985. A rebadged version was also sold as the [[Tandy Pocket Computer|TRS-80 Pocket Computer]] PC-2.

The whole computer was designed around the LH5801, an 8-bit CPU similar to the Zilog Z80, but all laid-out in power-saving CMOS circuits. Equipped with 2 KB of on-board RAM, the programming language is BASIC. Later, German engineers provided an assembler for the machine. Later even a C compiler followed.
An external slot is available and accepts memory (from 4 KB to 32 KB) and ROM modules.

Eight versions of this pocket computer with 2 KB memory:
*Sharp PC-1500 - Japanese version (1981)
*Sharp PC-1500 - Japanese version with blue paint around LCD. CE-157 Kana module bundle model. Known as PC-1500D (1984)
*Sharp PC-1500 - European, Australasian and North American version (1982)
*Sharp PC-1500 RP2 - Brazilian version (1982)
*HiradasTechnika PTA-4000 - Hungarian licence.
*HiradasTechnika PTA-4000+16 - Hungarian licence (with internal 16 KB memory extension)
*Tandy TRS-80 PC-2
*Nanfeng PC-1500A - Chinese license (CKD assembly from Japanese components)

Two versions with 8 KB memory:
*Sharp PC-1501 - Japanese rework with 8 KB memory (1984)
*Sharp PC-1500A - Western rework with 8 KB memory (1984)

==Related Sharp pocket computers==

* Sharp PC-1210
* Sharp PC-1211
* Sharp PC-1251
* Sharp PC-1500
* Sharp PC-1500A upgrade version with 8 KB onboard RAM
* Sharp PC-1501 Japanese version of PC-1500A
* Sharp PC-1600 with more memory and larger multi-line LCD display and more graphics capabilities

==BASIC compatibility with early models==
Some earlier model PC-1500s will show a value 1 less in the FOR...NEXT counter on exiting the loop compared to later PC-1500s and the PC-1600.

For example:
10 FOR K=1 TO 10
20 NEXT K
30 PRINT K
K will be set to 11 on later model PC-1500s and PC-1600s, but will be 10 on early PC-1500s.

Consider this example:
10 S=0
20 FOR K=1 TO 10 STEP 4
30 S=S+1
40 NEXT K
50 PRINT S
S will be set to 3 on later model PC-1500s and PC-1600s, but will be 4 on early PC-1500s.

Early model PC-1500s evaluate IF...THEN statements differently. The behaviour can be summarised thus:
An early model PC-1500 can be detected by using the command: PEEK&amp;C5C0.

If the value returned is 6, it is an early model.

==Example program in BASIC==

 1 ARUN 10
 5 REM &quot;PC1500 VAT Program:&quot;
 10 INPUT &quot;Price: &quot;;P
 20 PRINT P;&quot; &quot;;P*V;&quot; &quot;;P*V*M 
 30 GOTO 10
 40 END

The PC-1500 allows special abbreviations, and the syntax can also look as follows:

 20 PRINT P;&quot; &quot;;PV;&quot; &quot;;PVM
=== Usage of variables ===
 P = Purchase Price
 V = VAT (%/100) - To be input by hand before calculation begins, e.g.: V=1.14 (&quot;Enter&quot;)
 M = Markup (%/100) - To be input by hand before calculation begins, e.g.: M=1.15 (&quot;Enter&quot;)

=== Display of the answers are as follows ===
 Answer1; Answer2; Answer3
 Purchase Price; VAT Price; Sales Price
 Value: P; Value: P*V; Value: P*V*M

=== Program description ===
==Significance==

The design of initial prototypes of EMKE series of public transport cash registers were built around customized versions of the PC-1500 and its Hungarian clone PTA-4000. The series production models used almost exclusively in Hungarian regional and national bus services up to present day, are built around a version designed by EMKE and are heavily influenced by the PC-1500 design.

<text>Quarterly Essay, founded in 2001, is an Australian periodical published by Black Inc., concentrating primarily on Australian politics in a broad sense. Printed in a book-like page size and using a single-column format, each issue features a single extended essay of at least 20,000 words, with an introduction by the editor, and correspondence relating to essays in previous issues.

In early 2004 founding editor Peter Craven was sacked by the magazine&#x27;s owner, property developer Morry Schwartz, over a dispute about the joint authorship of one essay, and, more widely, the magazine&#x27;s future direction. Schwartz stated that while he had a vision of the magazine as more &quot;political and Australian&quot; whereas Craven was perhaps &quot;more broad and internationalist&quot;.

*Size: 170×72×9.5mm, weighing around 150 grams

== Peripherals ==
The machine has an 11-pin serial connector, which is almost through-hole compatible. This connects to a proprietary thermal printer, such as a CE-126P. The printer will also serve as an adapter to connect to a tape recorder. The tape recorder provides program and data backup.

== Variants ==

=== PC-1421 ===
The PC-1421 is a variant of the PC-1401 for financial calculations. It differs from the PC-1401 in the contents of its ROM and higher CPU speed. The PC-1421 CPU clocks at 768kHz vs 576kHz for the PC-1401.

=== PC-1430 ===
The PC-1430 is a stripped-down variant of the PC-1401. The display and case are mostly the same (except for fewer keys), but the PC-1430 lacks the calculator modus (for calculations the BASIC mode has to be used), it offers less functions, only 2 KB RAM, and no speaker or buzzer.

=== PC-1450 ===
The PC-1450 supports user changeable RAM cards: CE-211M (3070 bytes = 4 KB / Standard), CE-201M (7166 bytes = 8 KB) or CE-202M (15,358 bytes = 16 KB).

== Program examples ==

10 &quot;F&quot; &quot;allows to start the program with DEF F
20 INPUT &quot;N=?&quot;;N &quot;Ask for n
30 LET F=1 &quot;Set start value of F to 1
40 FOR I=1 TO N STEP 1 &quot;counts I from 1 to N
50 LET F=F*I &quot;calculates F=F*I
60 NEXT I &quot;repeats loop from line 40
70 PRINT USING &quot;##&quot;;N;&quot;!=&quot;; USING ;F &quot;print result - i.E. 5!=120
80 END &quot;end of program

<doc id="990035" wikidata="Q889661" url="?curid=990035" title="Thomas Riggs Jr.">
<text>Thomas W. Riggs Jr. (October 17, 1873 – January 16, 1945) was an American engineer who worked extensively in Alaska Territory, first as a leader of the team which surveyed the Alaska-Canada border and later as a Commissioner oversee construction of the Alaska Railroad. He was appointed Governor of Alaska Territory and served from 1918 till 1921. During his later life, Riggs served as United States Commissioner to the International Boundary Commission.

==Background==
Riggs was born to Thomas and Catherine Winter (Gilbert) Riggs on October 17, 1873, in Ilchester, Maryland. He was educated at the Emerson Institute and a variety of other private schools located in both the United States and Germany. He studied civil engineering at Princeton University, graduating in 1894.

Following graduation he moved with his family to Washington state and took a job as a newspaper reporter in Tacoma. In 1896, he joined his family&#x27;s lumber business in Bucoda before joining the Klondike Gold Rush the next year. From 1897 to 1901, Riggs prospected for gold near both Dawson City and Nome, Alaska, with little success. From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a mining engineer in Idaho, Montana, and Utah.

In 1903, Riggs joined the United States and Canada Boundary Survey. From 1906 to 1913, he worked on the team assigned to survey the Alaska-Canada border and advanced from the position of surveyor to become the United States Engineer-in-Charge. During this effort, the team surveyed the boundary from the Pacific to Arctic Oceans, placed boundary markers, and cleared wooded areas to provide a clear line of sight between markers.

Riggs married Renée Marie Coudert on April 30, 1913, in New York City. The marriage produced two children: Elizabeth C. and Thomas III.

Following his work surveying the Alaska-Canada border, on May 4, 1914, Riggs was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to the Alaskan Railroad Commission.
Along with the other two commissioners he oversaw the construction of the Alaska Railroad, Riggs being responsible for the Fairbanks division.

==Governorship==
United States Secretary of the Interior Franklin Knight Lane was impressed by Riggs&#x27; experience and recommended his appointment as Governor of Alaska Territory to President Woodrow Wilson. Following his confirmation, the new governor was sworn into office on April 12, 1918.

The United States had already entered the First World War by the time he entered office and the new governor encouraged Alaska to support the war effort. Under Riggs, the territory was a leader in the sale of both war savings stamps and Liberty Bonds. The new governor also worked to decrease overlaps between the territorial and federal governmental functions. He was successful in the areas of education, mine inspections, and road building but met strong resistance in his efforts to consolidate efforts within Alaska&#x27;s United States General Land Office.

Transportation was a major problem within the territory, with Riggs believing private shipping firms were providing unfair and inadequate service to Alaska. To rectify this problem, he proposed Alaska establish a fleet of transport ships and begin a territorial shipping service. The territorial legislature approved the plan but the U.S. Congress blocked it before the fleet could be established.

To deal with the Spanish flu, In October 1918 Riggs ordered doctors to meet arriving steamships upon arrival to inspect for signs of the virus and that transport firms refuse passage to the territory by anyone who was ill. The precautions were unsuccessful with the first case reaching Juneau on October 14 and widespread outbreaks being present a month later. In response to the flu&#x27;s arrival, Riggs established a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; on all trails to the interior, but unfortunately the couriers carrying announcements of the quarantine may have also spread the disease. The native population proved especially vulnerable, with up to an eight percent mortality rate during the pandemic. This left hundreds of orphans and entire villages whose populations were unable to perform basic activities such as prepare meals or chop firewood. In response, Riggs exceeded authorized funding levels in his spending on medical supplies, maintaining the quarantine, and providing relief efforts. The territory&#x27;s financial situation was further complicated when a request for a US$200,000 special allocation was cut in half by the U.S. Senate and rejected completely by the U.S. House of Representatives.

The end of his term of office came after the election of Warren Harding as President of the United States. Riggs left office on June 15, 1921, making way for Republican appointee Scott Cordelle Bone.

==Later life==
Following his time in office, Riggs moved to New York State, establishing his residence in Millbrook and an office in New York City. There he worked in the mining, oil, and construction industries and was named Vice-President of Macassa Mines, Ltd. of Canada. On August 2, 1935, Riggs was named the United States Commissioner to the International Boundary Commission.

Riggs died on January 16, 1945, in Washington D.C. He was buried in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. It is modeled after the business requirements specification (CONOPS). The software requirements specification lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction.

Software requirements specifications establish the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers on how the software product should function (in a market-driven project, these roles may be played by the marketing and development divisions). Software requirements specification is a rigorous assessment of requirements before the more specific system design stages, and its goal is to reduce later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules. Used appropriately, software requirements specifications can help prevent software project failure.

The software requirements specification document lists sufficient and necessary requirements for the project development. To derive the requirements, the developer needs to have a clear and thorough understanding of the products under development. This is achieved through detailed and continuous communications with the project team and customer throughout the software development process.

The SRS may be one of a contract&#x27;s deliverable data item descriptions or have other forms of organizationally-mandated content.

Typically a SRS is written by a technical writer, a systems architect, or a software programmer.

== History ==
Software requirement specifications are already used in software development processes as early as 1975. 

The purpose and content of software requirement specifications was formalised in 1983 by the IEEE. The standard was published in 1984 as IEEE-830-1984 and approved by ANSI. It was revised in 1993 and 1998, before being superseded by an international standard. This standard aimed at providing criteria for a good SRS, and recommendations about its content. It recognised the benefits of prototyping for the requirement engineering. It propose an example of structure and several variants. 

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard &quot;Systems and software engineering —Life cycle processes — Requirements engineering&quot; superseded IEEE 830 in 2011. The current revision is from 2018. This standard is broader as it covers also requirement quality criteria, requirement management processes, and business requirement specification (BRS), as well as stakeholder requirement specification (StRS). It proposes a slightly changed example structure. 

==Structure==
An example organization of an SRS is as follows: 

#Purpose
##Definitions
##Background 
##System overview
##References 
#Overall description
##Product perspective
###System Interfaces
###User interfaces
###Hardware interfaces
###Software interfaces
###Communication Interfaces
###Memory constraints
##Design constraints
###Operations
###Site adaptation requirements
##Product functions
##User characteristics 
##Constraints, assumptions and dependencies 
#Specific requirements
##External interface requirements
##Performance requirements
##Logical database requirement
##Software system attributes
###Reliability
###Availability
###Security
###Maintainability
###Portability
##Functional requirements
###Functional partitioning
###Functional description
###Control description
##Environment characteristics
###Hardware
###Peripherals
###Users
##Other
It would be recommended to address also verification approaches planned to qualify the software against the requirements, for example with a specific section with a structure that mirrors the section on specific requirements. 

==Requirement quality==
Requirements should strictly be about what is needed, independently of the system design, and not how the software should do it. Individual requirements shall hence be necessary, appropriate, and unambiguous. A set of requirements shall moreover be complete, consistent, feasible, and comprehensible. 

Following the idea of code smells, the notion of &quot;requirements smell&quot; has been proposed to describe issues in requirements specification where the requirement is not necessarily wrong but could be problematic. Examples of requirements smells are &quot;subjective language&quot;, &quot;ambiguous adverbs and adjectives&quot;, &quot;superlatives&quot; and &quot;negative statements&quot;. Comparative phrases, non-verifiable terms or terms implying totality should also be avoided.

<text>Monaco is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera, along the Mediterranean coast. The country has long been under the control of the Grimaldi family, who have encouraged musical development. Prince Rainier III introduced the Prince Rainier III Prize for Musical Composition to reward Monegasque musicians.

==Classical music==
The Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1863 and gained a permanent home at Salle Garnier in 1879. The Orchestra is quite prominent in the classical world, and has been conducted by Igor Markevitch, Lovro von Matačić, Paul Paray, Lawrence Foster, Gianluigi Gelmetti and Louis Frémaux.

The Little Singers of Monaco are a children&#x27;s choir founded in 1973, when the Palatine Chapel&#x27;s Chapel Master, Philippe Debat, was ordered by the government to send a choir of children around the world. This practice carries on a tradition from the reign of Prince Antoine I, during whose rule a children&#x27;s choir sang the liturgies in the Palatine Chapel.

==Popular music==
===Eurovision Song Contest participation===
 participated in the Eurovision Song Contest between 1959 and 1979 and again between 2004 and 2006. The country&#x27;s only win in the contest came in , with Séverine and the song &quot;Un banc, un arbre, une rue&quot;. None of the artists who represented Monaco in the contest was born Monegasque, but French-born Minouche Barelli, who represented Monaco in , shared her time between Paris and Monaco, acquired Monegasque citizenship in 2002, and died in the principality on 20 February 2004 at the age of 56.

===Notable artists===

<text>John Franklin Alexander Strong (October 15, 1856 – July 27, 1929) was a British North American-born journalist who was the second governor of Alaska Territory from 1913 to 1918.

==Background==
John Franklin Alexander Strong was born in Salmon Creek, a small farming community in Queens County, New Brunswick, British North America on October 15, 1856, the son of Adam Robert and Janet (Nicholl) Strong. He graduated from the New Brunswick Normal School in 1874. After graduation he spent the next fourteen years working as a store owner and teacher throughout the province. On December 31, 1879, he married Elizabeth A. Aitkens of Fredericton, New Brunswick. The marriage produced three children: Jane, Elizabeth, and Robert. He committed bigamy in 1896 when he wed Anna Hall of Tacoma, Washington.

Strong joined the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. During his travels he worked at newspapers in Dawson City, Skagway, Alaska, and Nome, Alaska. In 1905 he established &quot;The Nome Nugget&quot;. Strong left Alaska in 1906 to work as an Editor for papers in Tonopah, Nevada, and Greenwater, California. He returned to Alaska the next year, publishing the &quot;Herald&quot; in Katalla. In 1910 he founded the &quot;Nugget&quot; in Iditarod before becoming publisher of Juneau&#x27;s &quot;Alaska Daily Empire&quot; in 1912.

==Governorship==
President Woodrow Wilson nominated Strong to become governor of Alaska Territory on April 17, 1913. The nomination was in keeping with a 1912 Democratic plank calling for territorial governors to be area residents. The new governor was sworn into office on May 21, 1913.

Soon after becoming governor, Strong was faced with a financial crisis. The territory&#x27;s salmon canneries, claiming the recently enacted tax on canned salmon was illegal, refused to pay. The tax was a major source of income for the territory and the lack of funds thus created severely limited Strong&#x27;s ability to implement development projects. This issue continued until after the governor left office.

Significant legislation signed into law by Governor Strong included the granting of United States citizenship to members of the indigenous population that gave up tribal life, implementation of workers&#x27; compensation and the United States&#x27; first old age pension, authorization of a territorial university, and creation of a Board of Education. Additionally, in 1917, the voters in the territory approved a prohibition referendum. Other changes affecting the territory was the authorization for construction of the Alaska Railroad in October 1914, loosening of federal controls on road building and coal mining, and creation of Mount McKinley National Park in 1917.

President Wilson declined to reappoint Strong to a second term as governor and his final day in office came in April 1918. According to U.S. Senator and Alaskan history expert Ernest Gruening, the President declined to reappoint Strong because he had been given information indicating that the Canadian-born Strong had never been naturalized as a United States citizen.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Strong established his home in Seattle, Washington while wintering in Los Angeles. In 1922 he began a world tour. After spending a year in India, he returned to the United States in 1924. Strong died on July 27, 1929, in Seattle from a heart attack.

<text>Emotional Rescue is the fifteenth studio album by English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 23 June 1980 by Rolling Stones Records. Following the success of their previous album, &quot;Some Girls&quot;, their biggest hit to date, the Rolling Stones returned to the studio in early 1979 to start writing and recording its follow-up. Full-time members Mick Jagger (vocals), Keith Richards (guitar), Ronnie Wood (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums) were joined by frequent collaborators Ian Stewart (keyboards), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards), Bobby Keys (saxophone) and Sugar Blue (harmonica).

Upon release, the album topped the charts in at least six countries, including the United States, UK, and Canada. Hit singles from it include the title track, which reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United States, and No. 9 in the UK and &quot;She&#x27;s So Cold&quot;, a top-40 single in several countries. The recording sessions for &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; were so productive that several tracks left off the album would form the core of the follow-up, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Tattoo You&quot;.

==History==
Recorded throughout 1979, first in Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas, then Pathé Marconi, Paris, with some end-of-year overdubbing in New York City at The Hit Factory, &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; was the first Rolling Stones album recorded following Keith Richards&#x27; exoneration from a Toronto drugs charge that could have landed him in jail for years. Fresh from the revitalization of &quot;Some Girls&quot; (1978), Richards and Mick Jagger led the Stones through dozens of new songs, some of which were held over for &quot;Tattoo You&quot; (1981), and picked 10 for &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;.

Several of the tracks on the album featured just the core Rolling Stones band members: Jagger, Richards, Ronnie Wood, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman. On others, they were joined by keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and co-founder Ian Stewart, sax player Bobby Keys and harmonica player Sugar Blue.

Songs left off the album appeared on &quot;Tattoo You&quot; (&quot;Hang Fire&quot;, &quot;Little T&amp;A&quot; and &quot;No Use in Crying&quot;). &quot;Think I&#x27;m Going Mad&quot;, another song from the sessions, was released as the B-side to &quot;She Was Hot&quot; in 1984. A cover song sung by Richards, &quot;We Had It All&quot;, was released on the 2011 deluxe &quot;Some Girls&quot; package.

==Packaging and artwork==
The album cover for &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; had concept origination, art direction and design by Peter Corriston with thermographic photos taken by British-born, Paris-based artist Roy Adzak using a thermal camera, a device that measures heat emissions. The original release came wrapped in a huge colour poster featuring more thermo-shots of the band with the album itself wrapped in a plastic bag. The original music video shot for &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; also utilised the same type of shots of the band performing. A short time later a second video for &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; was shot, directed by David Mallett (produced by Paul Flattery &amp; Simon Fields) as well as one for &quot;She&#x27;s So Cold&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Released in June with the disco-infused hit title track as the lead single, &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; was an immediate smash. The title track hit No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album gave the Rolling Stones their first UK No. 1 album since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; and spent seven weeks atop the US charts. The follow-up single &quot;She&#x27;s So Cold&quot; was a top 30 hit while &quot;Dance Pt. 1&quot; reached No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance chart.

Critical reception was relatively muted, with most reviewers considering the album somewhat formulaic and unambitious, particularly in contrast to its predecessor. Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ariel Swartley stated that &quot;as far as the music goes, &#x27;familiar&#x27; is an understatement. There&#x27;s hardly a melody here that you haven&#x27;t heard from the Stones before&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau summarized it as &quot;an ordinary Stones album&quot; in an essay accompanying the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll of 1980&#x27;s best albums, in which &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; finished 20th, a result which he deemed &quot;so far out of the money&quot; for &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest rock and roll band&quot;.

Retrospective assessments have been kinder, with several critics praising the band&#x27;s performance, despite the sometimes lightweight material. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that the album &quot;may consist mainly of filler, but it&#x27;s expertly written and performed filler&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Christgau said that, while not &quot;great&quot;, the album boasts a &quot;mid-&#x27;60s [lyrical] charm&quot; in &quot;such tossed-off tropes as &#x27;Where the Boys Go&#x27; and &#x27;She&#x27;s So Cold&#x27;&quot;, alongside a musical style &quot;looser&quot; than other less-than-great Stones records like &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; (1974): &quot;[The music is] far more allusive and irregular and knowing: for better and worse its drive isn&#x27;t so monolithic, and the bass comes front and center like Bill was James Jamerson.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. In 2011, it was released by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated many elements of the original album packaging, including the colour poster.

<text>Tukino skifield is located on the eastern face of Mount Ruapehu, in the central area of the North Island, New Zealand.

A club managed field, Tukino is open to the general public and both skiing and snowboarding are popular.

The ski field area is serviced by two permanent rope tows, a portable rope tow, and an over-snow vehicle providing &#x27;cat skiing&#x27; where customers are driven to the upper reaches of the ski area, enabling them to ski or board the entire height of the field. The terrain includes a learner slope, intermediate and advanced technical terrain, and off piste areas.

Tukino is known for its untouched trails, uncrowded slopes, friendly atmosphere and good weather being on the lee side of the mountain. Day visitors will want to pack a lunch as there is no food service available.
== Access ==
Access is via the Tukino access Road from the Desert Road, and is suitable for four wheel drive vehicles only during the winter months. There is a carpark for 2WD vehicles 6 km in from the Desert Road turnoff. Transport from the 2WD carpark can be arranged by contacting the skifield during the winter season. The road may be closed for safety reasons during the winter season, phone the ski field for up to date information.
== Accommodation at affiliated clubs ==
Accommodation is available at Tukino for those that want to stay and play. This is provided by the three clubs who have lodges at the top of the access road. Bookings are essential. There are three clubs which have lodges at Tukino Skifield:

* Tukino Alpine Sports Club 
* Aorangi Ski Club
* Desert Alpine Club
Aorangi and Desert Alpine lodges operate in the winter season only, while the Tukino Alpine Sports Club lodge is available for accommodation year round.

== Rock and ice climbing at Tukino ==
There are over 200 established rockclimbing routes in the Tukino area, with scope for further development. The volcanic rock is generally sound and offers reasonable protection and tends to stay clean in the alpine environment.

The generally southeast aspect and multitude of climbs at low altitude make it a particularly good location for ice climbing on Ruapehu.

<doc id="990046" wikidata="Q386303" url="?curid=990046" title="Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt (notated Dynasty XXX, alternatively 30th Dynasty or Dynasty 30) is usually classified as the fifth Dynasty of the Late Period of ancient Egypt. It was founded after the overthrow of Nepherites II in 380 BC by Nectanebo I, and was disestablished upon the invasion of Egypt by the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes III in 343 BC. This is the final native dynasty of ancient Egypt; after the deposition of Nectanebo II, Egypt fell under foreign domination.

== History ==
Nectanebo I had gained control of all of Egypt by November of 380 BC, but spent much of his reign defending his kingdom from Persian reconquest with the occasional help of Sparta or Athens. In 365 BC, Nectanebo made his son, Teos, co-king and heir, and until his death in 363 BC, father and son reigned together. After his father&#x27;s death, Teos invaded the Persian territories of modern Syria and Israel and was beginning to meet with some successes when he lost his throne due to the machinations of his own brother Tjahapimu. Tjahepimu took advantage of Teos&#x27; unpopularity within Egypt by declaring his son—and Teos&#x27; nephew, Nectanebo II—king. The Egyptian army rallied around Nectanebo II which forced Teos to flee to the court of the king of Persia.

Nectanebo II&#x27;s reign was dominated by the efforts of the Persian rulers to reconquer Egypt, which they considered a satrapy in revolt. For the first ten years, Nectanebo avoided the Persian reconquest because Artaxerxes III was forced to consolidate his control of the realm. Artaxerxes then attempted an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt in the winter of 351/350 BC; the repercussions of his defeat prompted revolts in Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cilicia. Although Nectanebo gave support to these revolts, Artaxerxes would eventually suppress these rebellions and was once again able to invade Egypt in 343 BC. This second invasion proved successful, and Nectanebo was forced to withdraw from his defenses in the Nile Delta to Memphis, where he saw that his cause was lost. He thereupon fled south to Nubia, where he is assumed to have found refuge at the court of King Nastasen of Napata. Nectanebo, however, may have managed to maintain some form of independent rule in the south of Egypt for 2 more years since a document from Edfu is dated to his eighteenth year.

Although a shadowy figure named Khababash proclaimed himself king and led a rebellion against the Persians from about 338 to 335 BC, Nectanebo has been considered the last native pharaoh of Egypt. His flight marked the end of Egypt as an independent entity.

<text>Walter Eli Clark (January 7, 1869 – February 4, 1950) was an American journalist and newspaper publisher. In addition to his journalistic activities, he was the last Governor of the District of Alaska from 1909 to 1912, and the first Governor of Alaska Territory from 1912 to 1913.

==Background==
Clark was born on January 7, 1869, to Oren Andrus and Jeannette (Jones) Clark in Ashford, Connecticut. He was educated in public school and in 1887 graduated from the Connecticut State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University). Clark taught at a school in Waterville, Connecticut, before becoming Principal of Manchester, Connecticut&#x27;s grade school. In 1891 he enrolled at Williston Seminary. From there he went to Wesleyan University and graduated with a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1895.

Following his graduation, Clark worked briefly in Hartford as a reporter for &quot;The Hartford Post&quot;. From there he moved to Washington, D.C., where he became a telegraph editor for the &quot;Washington Times&quot;. He followed this by a stint as a Washington correspondent for the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser&quot; before joining &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s Washington bureau in 1897. Clark remained with &quot;The Sun&quot; until 1909, adding the roles of Washington correspondent for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; in 1900 and &quot;The Globe&quot; (Toronto) in 1904.

Clark married Lucy Harrison Norvell of Washington, D.C., on January 15, 1898.

==Alaska==
Clark was appointed Governor of the District of Alaska by President William Howard Taft on May 18, 1909. The president considered the new governor to be knowledgeable about the district because Clark had prospected for gold near Nome, Alaska, for a short time in 1900 and traveled through the district in both 1903 and 1906. This view was however not universally held, with some Alaskans viewing the new governor as a carpetbagger.

As governor, Clark attempted to bring the district&#x27;s various political factions together. One point where he differed from the majority of Alaskans was on the issue of territorial status, which the governor opposed. Clark&#x27;s opposition was based upon Alaska&#x27;s small population (36,556 whites) and the general lack of transportation infrastructure throughout the district. His opposition however became moot when Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives during the 1910 election. With the House under Democratic control, legislation granting Alaska territorial status was pushed through and became effective on August 24, 1912.

During the territory&#x27;s first legislative session, Clark signed laws creating a variety of regulatory agencies and implementing compulsory education, juvenile courts, eight-hour days for workers in many industries, and women&#x27;s suffrage. The legislature also followed his recommendation to impose a tax on the canning of salmon. His last day in office came on May 21, 1913, when he resigned to make way for Wilson appointee John Franklin Alexander Strong.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Clark moved to Charleston, West Virginia. There he purchased the &quot;News Mail&quot; and changed the paper&#x27;s name to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Clark served as publisher and editor in chief of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for the rest of his life.

Lucy Harrison Norvell Clark died in May 1928. The former governor remarried the next year, wedding Juliet (Staunton) Clay on August 13, 1929.

Socially he was a member of Charleston&#x27;s Edgewood Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Arctic Club, and Washington&#x27;s Chevy Chase Club. He was also cultivated an interest in rose cultivation. In this role he founded the Charleston Rose Society in 1922 and served as president of the American Rose Society in 1928 through 1929. Additionally he was a judge at the 1929 International Rose Show.

In 1945, Clark received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Wesleyan University. That same year he experienced a heart attack and suffered from poor health for the next five years. Clark died in Charleston from another heart attack on February 4, 1950.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Juliet Staunton Clark took over the management of the newspaper. Three years later she was found brutally beaten to death in her Charleston home on August 21, 1953. Despite the Daily Mail offering a $15,000 reward, her killer has never been determined.

<doc id="990053" wikidata="Q131993" url="?curid=990053" title="Wilford Bacon Hoggatt">
<text>Wilford Bacon Hoggatt (September 11, 1865 – February 26, 1938) was an American naval officer and businessman who served as the sixth Governor of the District of Alaska.

==Background==
Hoggatt was born to Isabell (Bacon) and William M Hoggatt on September 11, 1865, in Paoli, Indiana. He attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating in June 1884 before beginning his career as a naval officer. In 1889 Hoggatt received a four-year assignment to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in which he surveyed the coastal waters of southeastern Alaska.

On June 12, 1893, Hoggatt married Marie Hayden of St. Louis in Washington D.C. The marriage lasted until her death in 1900. In June 1893, he graduated from the Columbian University Law School of the District of Columbia (now George Washington University Law School) with an LL.B. He then served as a legal officer in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps and as Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Equipment at the United States Naval Observatory. During the Spanish–American War, Hoggatt was appointed to the Naval Board of Strategy by President William McKinley.

Hoggatt resigned from the U.S. Navy in August 1898 and enrolled in the Columbia School of Mines. After a year, he moved with his brother Herbert to Juneau, Alaska. There the pair purchased some mining claims and established the Juneau Mines Company at nearby Berners Bay. The business was a financial success and Hoggatt served as the company&#x27;s manager.

==Governorship==
President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Hoggatt Governor of the District of Alaska on March 10, 1906. The new governor remarried on February 25 of the next year. His second marriage, to Clarissa Eames Millard of Utica, New York, produced three daughters: Clarissa, Isabelle, and Elinor.

The new governor was a strong proponent of economic development, with expanded coal mining being a focus of his efforts. He viewed coal as a useful energy source and needed material for establishing railroads within the district. Hoggatt was thwarted in his efforts however, first by the U.S. Congress, who were looking to control the growth of new monopolies, passing legislation limiting the size of mining districts. Then in November 1906, President Roosevelt barred all coal-mining on public lands. As the vast majority of Alaska was owned by the federal government, this effectively prohibited coal mining in Alaska.

Another frustration for Hoggatt was his inability to convince the federal legislature to revise surveying laws. This created problems for homesteaders and gold miners wishing to move to Alaska. Hoggatt did oversee the move of Alaska&#x27;s capital from Sitka to Juneau. In a break with the majority of the district&#x27;s population, the governor opposed granting territorial status. This was due to Hoggatt fearing that potential new taxes created by a territorial legislature would discourage further economic development.

The end of Hoggatt&#x27;s term as governor came on May 18, 1909, when he resigned to make way for President William Howard Taft&#x27;s appointment of Walter Eli Clark.

==Later life==
Following his term in office, Hoggart returned to his position as a mining manager. He stayed there until 1912 when he became President of the Keyes Product Company in New London, Connecticut. Hoggart remained with the fiber board manufacturer until the company&#x27;s dissolution in 1926. The former governor then moved to New York City where he spent the rest of his life, the final two years in declining health. Hoggart died on February 26, 1938, in The Bronx. He was buried in Utica, New York.

<doc id="990054" wikidata="Q7515221" url="?curid=990054" title="Silk comforter">
<text>A silk comforter (絲綿被) is a bed covering, most often used as a duvet, and also commonly referred to as a silk duvet, silk quilt, or silk blanket. Originally used and made in China, since the late 20th century, silk comforters have become more common in Western market areas. Their increasing popularity stems from a combination of factors, including their thermal properties, their light weight, and their natural hypoallergenic properties. The opening of the Chinese market to the world since the 1990s has also played a significant role in the spread of silk comforters, as China is both the world&#x27;s biggest silk producer and silk comforter manufacturer.

== Production and processing ==

Silk comes from the cocoons of the silkworm, which feeds off mulberry trees in subtropical climates. When the cocoon is boiled, the hard cocoon becomes a loose ball of strong, flexible filament measuring over 1,000 meters. Usually, this ball is uncoiled and wrapped on a spindle for use in the textile industry. Silk is used for making everything from clothing to rugs. During silk comforter production, however, the silk filament is not unraveled, but rather stretched into a flat tangled web and layered to form silk floss, which will fill the comforter.

The cocoons are first boiled to loosen the sericin holding the filaments together and kill the silkworm. Each cocoon is stretched by hand on a U-shaped wooden rack, and the ball of thread becomes a sheet of tangled fibers. This sheet is then hand-stretched again on a larger rack, along with several other cocoons to make a thick, cottony bundle called silk floss. It takes hundreds of these bundles to make a silk comforter. 

Once enough silk cocoons have been stretched into bundles, the comforter begins to take shape. Workers grab the edges of the bundle and stretch it wide to match the dimensions of the desired comforter, and layer by layer the comforter begins to take shape. It can take anywhere between 100 and 400 of these thin layers to make a comforter, depending on bed dimensions and desired thickness. Since it takes many cocoons to make each layer, a silk comforter may be composed of thousands of silk cocoons.

Once the silk fiber layers are stacked together, they are sealed inside silk or cotton fabrics and the comforter is complete. The result is extremely light-weight despite the silk comforter&#x27;s thickness. Silk comforters provide excellent insulating properties similar to down, but tend to be less bulky than down duvets. Silk is a breathable fabric, making silk comforters comfortable in a wide temperature range. Thin silk comforters are used even in the summer.

In the U.S., silk comforters are imported mainly from China or Taiwan and are priced about the same as down comforters. Unlike other natural fibers used in comforters, silk is naturally hypoallergenic, and it does not require any processing chemicals during the manufacturing process. A silk comforter is a good alternative for people who are allergic to goose down comforters.

== Silk comforter care ==

Silk comforters are easy to care for: they only need to be dried under the sun twice a year to maintain their freshness. If more thorough cleaning is required, a silk comforter should be dry-cleaned, since the silk floss layers are damaged by contact with water.

They may have a fairly strong smell to them, attributed to the remaining pupa. There is some difference of opinion about how easy it is to get rid of the smell.

== Cost in China ==

In November 2017, at a large government silk products store in Shanghai, the cost for a 100% silk queen-sized 2 kg silk quilt (duvet, comforter) had the &#x27;fixed price&#x27; of Yuan 1880 or approximately U.S. $285 (there are no additional costs). Government fixed-price stores, which one can apparently trust as regards quality, sometimes allow customers to bargain. The price is composed of two parts: one is the silk filler, and the other is the cotton cover.

<doc id="990055" wikidata="Q3090989" url="?curid=990055" title="Fur Fighters">
<text>Fur Fighters (titled &quot;Furrballs&quot; in early development) is a video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Dreamcast in 2000, later for Microsoft Windows. The game was first announced as a Dreamcast exclusive in the January 1999 issue of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, having started development in the summer of 1998. It was designed very much as a standard third-person shooter, but used a world populated by cute little animals as its setting. As a result, the game&#x27;s depiction of violence is very cartoon-like without losing any of its intensity. In 2001, an updated version for the PlayStation 2 was released as Fur Fighters: Viggo&#x27;s Revenge. On 20 July 2012, members of Muffin Games, ex-Bizarre Creations staff, announced a conversion for iPad, called Fur Fighters: Viggo on Glass.

==Plot==
The plot of the game revolves around the Fur Fighters, a group dedicated to fighting against General Viggo, the game&#x27;s main antagonist. At the beginning of the game, Viggo kidnaps the families of the Fur Fighters, stranding their children around the game&#x27;s various locations and turning the spouses (or in Tweek&#x27;s case, mother) into robotic beasts. The story is rather loose, revolving around the Fur Fighters&#x27; quest to rescue their babies, save their family, and stop General Viggo.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Fur Fighters&quot;, the player&#x27;s job is to rescue the tiny animal babies who have been taken from their families by the central villain, General Viggo. Viggo has scattered these babies all over the world, requiring the Fur Fighter families to explore, confront Viggo&#x27;s henchmen, and rescue all of them. The gameplay featured many unique aspects for a third-person shooter of the time it was released, most notably making each level an extremely large, expansive area that requires sometimes hours of involved exploration to locate the babies and get rid of the enemies. (Examples include a giant construction site and an entire section of a large city, complete with buildings to explore, including a complete museum of modern art.) Maneuvering through these levels often requires careful observation of the environment so as not to get lost, as well as solving puzzles to figure out where some babies might be hidden or how to gain access to more of the level. Unlike most action games of this type, &quot;Fur Fighters&quot; distinguishes itself by featuring a system where the player can, at many intervals on a level, switch between one of many animal parents. Each parent has their own advantages and disadvantages, with many having special abilities allowing them to do certain things easier. This substitute system also makes it easier for players who are low on hit points or ammunition to switch to a more suitable character.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version of &quot;Fur Fighters&quot; received &quot;favourable&quot; reviews, while its PC version, along with &quot;Viggo&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Viggo on Glass&quot;, received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Garrett Kenyon of &quot;NextGen&quot;″s August 2000 issue called the Dreamcast version &quot;A game that&#x27;s fun for kids and adults alike. It looks great and plays even better.&quot; Twelve issues later, however, Daniel Erickson said in his review of &quot;Viggo&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;If you want a shooter or an adventure game, there are better places to turn.&quot;

Jake The Snake of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the Dreamcast version in one review, &quot;If you&#x27;d enjoy a smart, cartoon-based action/adventure game and [you] won&#x27;t be turned off by the guns, don&#x27;t miss &quot;Fur Fighters&quot;.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Iron Thumbs said, &quot;&quot;Fur Fighters&quot; isn&#x27;t all shoot &#x27;em up adventure: the game is packed with everything from small, simple puzzles to extended challenges requiring serious planning and strategy to execute them successfully.&quot; &quot;GameZone&quot; gave &quot;Viggo&#x27;s Revenge&quot; eight out of ten, saying that it &quot;Provides enough of a rush to deal with the fact that the game tends to get a little monotonous.&quot;

While the game was not a tremendous financial success and went almost unnoticed by the majority of gamers at the time, critically the game was almost universally praised for its size, scope, sense of humour, and attention to detail. The fact that mindless violence was not the sole gameplay element impressed many, and the game went on to become a cult classic of sorts.

<doc id="990059" wikidata="Q886002" url="?curid=990059" title="John Green Brady">
<text>John (James) Green Brady (June 15, 1848 – December 17, 1918) was an American politician who served as the Governor of the District of Alaska from 1897 to 1906. Brady was forced to resign due to his alleged involvement with the fraudulent Reynolds–Alaska Development Company.

==Childhood==
John Green Brady was born in New York City. Upon the death of his mother, his father remarried. Brady did not get along well with his step-mother, and at the age of eight ran away from home to avoid beatings from his drunken father. He was found living on the streets of New York City by Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. a well-known and popular New York City philanthropist and the father of future US 26th President, Theodore Roosevelt. Many years later, as an adult, Brady would approach the younger Theodore Roosevelt, then governor of New York, at a 1900 conference in Portland, Oregon. He warmly shook Roosevelt&#x27;s hand and told him:

&quot;Governor Roosevelt, the other governors have greeted you with interest, simply as a fellow governor and a great American. but I greet you with infinitely more interest, as the son of your father, the first Theodore Roosevelt.&quot; When greeted warmly by Governor Roosevelt and asked why and in what special way he had been interested in his father, Governor Brady replied, &quot;Your father picked me up on the streets of New York, a waif and an orphan, and sent me to a Western family, paying for my transportation and early care. Years passed and I was able to repay the money which had given me my start in life, but I can never repay what he did for me, for it was through that early care and by giving me such a foster mother and father that I gradually rose in the world until I greet his son as a fellow governor of a part of our great country.&quot;

Brady was living at the House of Refuge on Randall&#x27;s Island when he learned about the Orphan Train. The eleven-year-old Brady declared himself to be an orphan and, on August 2, 1859, boarded a train bound for Indiana. Over the course of the week-long journey, Brady forged what would be a lifelong friendship with Andrew Burke, another boy his age from Randall&#x27;s. The boys got off the train at Noblesville, Indiana, where they were taken to &quot;Aunt&quot; Jenny Fergusson&#x27;s hotel, fed and, in turn, put on display for prospective adopters.

Brady&#x27;s experience as an orphan train rider is discussed in the book &quot;Orphan Trains: Taking the Rails to a New Life&quot;, by Rebecca Langston-George.

Brady went to live with the family of John Green, of Tipton County, Indiana. Judge John Green recalled, &quot;I decided to take John Brady home with me because I considered him the homeliest, toughest, most unpromising boy in the whole lot. I had a curious desire to see what could be made of such a specimen of humanity.&quot; Brady attended Yale University and graduated in 1874.

Brady married Elizabeth Jane Patton in 1887 in Sitka, Alaska. They had five children: John Green Brady Jr., Hugh P. Brady, Sheldon Jackson Brady, Mary Beattie Brady and Elizabeth P. Brady.

==District of Alaska==
Brady moved to the Alaska Territory first as a Presbyterian minister, then a missionary and then a lawyer. In 1878 he co-founded what is now Sheldon Jackson College as a school to train Alaska Natives.

Later he would be appointed Governor for three terms. He was introduced to the infamous Alaskan gangster Soapy Smith during the 1898 Fourth of July festivities in Skagway. Brady was made aware of Smith&#x27;s criminal activities and offered him a position as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Sitka, if he would quit Skagway. Smith turned down the position, which Brady noted in a personal letter. Four days after meeting him, Smith was killed in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf.

Governor Brady had an interest in preserving the culture of the Alaska natives. He orchestrated the placement of 15 Haida and Tlingit totem poles and two traditional houses for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. He was instrumental in the preservation and relocation of the totem poles from Old Kasaan village to Sitka shortly after Old Kasaan&#x27;s abandonment.

In 1897, Brady was appointed to be Governor of the Territory of Alaska by Republican President William McKinley. He served for three terms and became involved in the Reynolds-Alaska Development Company which was under investigation for corruption. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior) (R) under Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, charged that Brady had acted improperly in his association with Reynolds-Alaska and public clamor soon led Brady to resign though he vigorously denied that he was guilty of any wrongdoing. Without charges, Brady was asked to resign in 1906 and went to work for Reynolds-Alaska. He was never convicted.

Brady died on December 17, 1918, and was buried in Sitka National Cemetery in Sitka, Alaska. He was interred in Section R, Plot 4 in December 1918. The monument at his grave bears the inscription: &quot;A life ruled by faith in God and Man.&quot;

<doc id="990061" wikidata="Q324065" url="?curid=990061" title="James Sheakley">
<text>James Sheakley (April 24, 1829December 10, 1917) was an American Democratic politician who was the Governor of the District of Alaska from 1893 to 1897. He was also a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania from 1875 to 1877.

==Background==
Sheakley was born on April 24, 1829, to Moses and Susanna (Limber) Sheakley in Sheakleyville, Pennsylvania. He was educated at the Sheakleyville common school and Meadville Academy. Sheakley was trained as a cabinet maker but worked instead as a teacher in rural schools.

The California Gold Rush prompted Sheakley to head west. Arriving in San Francisco on February 2, 1852, he worked as a miner for three years. Sheakley returned to Pennsylvania after his work in the gold fields and married Lydia Long of Greenville, Pennsylvania on December 25, 1855. The marriage would produce three children, two daughters who died as children and one son who survived to adulthood.

Following his wedding, Sheakley moved to Greenville and, in 1860, established a dry goods business. Then, with the start of the Pennsylvanian oil rush, he switched industries and became a pioneer of the oil industry.

==Congressional career==
Sheakley continued his work in the oil industry until 1874. Running in a traditionally Republican area, the Democrat was elected to represent Pennsylvania&#x27;s 26th congressional district. He advocated passage of legislation blocking the use of rebates of freight charges during the transportation of petroleum products on the railroads. He pushed through an appropriation that enlarged the Bureau of Education. During the resolution of the 1876 U.S. presidential election, he helped lead a filibuster blocking the bill granting the Presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes. He was unsuccessful during his 1876 run for reelection.

==Alaska==
Upon the recommendation of US Secretary of the Interior Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, Sheakley was appointed a United States Commissioner for District of Alaska, a position equivalent to a U.S. Circuit Court judge, on June 23, 1887. After starting this position in Wrangell, Alaska on August 9, 1887, the Commissioner of Education added to his duties by appointing his superintendent of schools for southeastern Alaska. In 1888, Sheakley was admitted to the Alaskan bar.

He was one of Alaska&#x27;s two delegates to the 1892 Democratic National Convention. During the convention, the Alaska delegation cast the final two votes needed to secure the party&#x27;s nomination for Grover Cleveland.

<text>Robert Caldwell (7 May 1814 – 28 August 1891) was a British missionary and linguist.

A missionary for the London Missionary Society, he arrived in British India at age 24, and studied the local language to spread the word of the Bible in a vernacular language, studies that led him to author a text on comparative grammar of the South Indian languages. In his book, Caldwell proposed that there are Dravidian words in the Hebrew of the Old Testament, the archaic Greek language, and the places named by Ptolemy.

Caldwell married Eliza Mault, the daughter of another missionary Rev. Charles Mault posted in India. He served as assistant bishop of Tirunelveli from 1877.

The Government of Tamil Nadu has created a memorial in his honor and a postage stamp has been issued in his name. A statue of Caldwell was erected in 1967 near to Marina Beach, Chennai, as a gift of the Church of South India.

==Early life==
Robert Caldwell was born at Clady, Ireland. on 7 May 1814 to poor Scottish Presbyterian parents. The family moved to Glasgow and there he began work at the age of nine. Mostly self-taught, he returned to Ireland aged 15, living with an older brother in Dublin while studying art between 1829 and 1833. He then returned to Glasgow, probably as a consequence of a crisis of faith, and he became active in the Congregational church.

Caldwell won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford only to find it rescinded when the authorities discovered that he had been born in Ireland. He responded by joining the London Missionary Society, who sent him to the University of Glasgow for training. There Caldwell came under the influence of Daniel Keyte Sandford, a professor of Greek and promoter of Anglicanism whose innovative research encouraged Caldwell&#x27;s liking for comparative philology and also theology. Caldwell left university with a distinction and was ordained as a Congregationalist minister.

At 24, Caldwell arrived in Madras on 8 January 1838 as a missionary of the London Missionary Society and later joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission (SPG). To further his missionary objectives, Caldwell realized that he had to be proficient in Tamil to proselytize &quot;the masses?&quot; and he began a systematic study of the language. He was consecrated Bishop of Tirunelveli in 1877. In 1844, Caldwell married Eliza Mault (1822–1899) in CSI Home Church, Nagercoil, with whom he had seven children. Eliza Mault, born in Nagercoil, was the younger daughter of the veteran Travancore missionary, Rev. Charles Mault (1791–1858) of the London Missionary Society. For more than forty years, Eliza worked in Idaiyangudi and Tirunelveli proselytizing the people, especially Tamil-speaking women.

==Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;==

Robert Caldwell wrote &quot;A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages&quot;. He identified south Indian Brahmins with Indo-Europeans, which was partly based on his belief that the Indo-Europeans had &quot;higher mental gifts and higher capacity for civilisation&quot;. Caldwell asserted that the low-caste Chanar were not merely Tamil speakers but an &quot;indigenous Dravidian&quot; people, distinct ethnically and, most critically for him, religiously, from their high-caste oppressors, whom he referred to as &quot;Brahmanical Aryans&quot; (in this case &quot;Aryan&quot; as an ethnic signifier for foreign and &quot;Brahmanical&quot; to signify the &quot;Hinduism&quot; of the high-caste). These wildly speculative claims, well outside the scope of linguistics, were intended &quot;to develop a history which asserted that the indigenous Dravidians had been subdued and colonized by the Brahmanical Aryans&quot;. However, the first edition of Caldwell&#x27;s grammar was &quot;met with firm resistance&quot; by the Chanars precisely because they &quot;did not like the idea of being divorced from Brahmanical civilization&quot;, the very division Caldwell was hoping to exploit.

The book has been described as being on occasion &quot;pejorative, outrageous, and somewhat paternalistic. But on the whole, his studies represent a pioneering effort to understand religions completely foreign to the British mind&quot;. In the domain of Dravidian linguistics though, it remains a respected work today.



==Archaeological research==
While serving as Bishop of Tirunelveli (alongside Edward Sargent), Caldwell (who was not a trained archaeologist) did much original research on the history of Tirunelveli. He studied palm leaf manuscripts and Sangam literature in his search, and made several excavations, finding the foundations of ancient buildings, sepulchral urns and coins with the fish emblem of the Pandyan Kingdom. This work resulted in his book &quot;A Political and General History of the District of Tinnevely&quot; (1881), published by the Government of the Madras Presidency.
==Legacy==
Caldwell’s mission lasted more than fifty years. The publication of his research into both the languages and the history of the region, coupled with his position in both Indian and English society, gave stimulus to the revival of the Non-Brahmin movement.

Meanwhile, on difficult ground for evangelism, Caldwell achieved Christian conversion among the lower castes. He had adopted some of the methods of the Lutheran missionaries of earlier times, having learned German purely in order to study their practices.

Caldwell the Tamil language scholar, Christian evangelist and champion of the native church, remains today an important figure in the modern history of South India. He is still remembered there, and his statue, erected eighty years after his death, stands near the Marina Beach at Chennai. The Indian historian Dr M.S.S. Pandian, visiting fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, recently commented that Caldwell’s &quot;contribution to both Christianity in South India and the cultural awakening of the region is unmatched during the last two hundred years&quot;.

A commemorative postage stamp on him was issued on 7 May 2010.

<text>Lyman Enos Knapp (November 5, 1837 – October 9, 1904) was an American lawyer, journalist, and politician who served as the Governor of the District of Alaska from 1889 to 1893. He was also a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1884 to 1885.

==Early life and education==
Knapp was born November 5, 1837, in Somerset, Vermont, to Hiram and Elvira (Stearns) Knapp. He was educated in Manchester, Vermont, first attending Burr and Burton Academy and then graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Middlebury College in 1862.

== Career ==

=== Military service ===
After graduating from college, Knapp enlisted as a private in the Company I, 16th Vermont Infantry Regiment and was quickly promoted to captain of Company F, 17th Vermont Infantry Regiment. During his military service, he was wounded at Gettysburg, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg. Knapp rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was brevetted a colonel for his gallantry during the Siege of Petersburg.

=== Vermont ===
Following the war, Knapp returned to Vermont where he published the &quot;Middlebury Register&quot; from 1865 till 1878. In addition to the work on his own newspaper, he submitted articles to the &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot; and the &quot;American Law Register&quot;. Beyond his journalistic efforts, Knapp served as Clerk of the Vermont Legislature during the 1872–1873 session. After being admitted to the bar in 1876, he served as a probate judge for the Addison district from 1879 to 1889. Knapp was also elected for a term in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1884 to 1885.

===Governor of Alaska===
Knapp was appointed Governor of the District of Alaska by President Benjamin Harrison, his term beginning on April 20, 1889. At the time of his appointment, many Alaskans desired a resident governor and were disappointed receiving an &quot;outsider&quot;. The district did, however, see a number of improvements during his administration. Postal service was extended with the creation of over of new mail routes. Knapp also helped establish a historical society and library.

On the legal front, Knapp asked for Alaska to be granted a delegate to the U.S. Congress. He also supported creation of a commission to revise the district&#x27;s legal code and, arguing that lack of clear land possession discouraged improvements, lobbied for a revision of the land possession laws. To help maintain law and order, Knapp help organize both a militia and Indian police. The former turned into a source of amusement for some area residents due to the governor&#x27;s predilection for dressing in his military uniform and watch the militia parade before him.

During his term, an international dispute over seal fisheries reached a zenith. The United States, claiming that seals from Alaska were being killed by Canadian and other ships on the high seas, had seized several ships and brought them to Sitka. Arbitration to resolve the dispute was agreed to in 1891 between Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As a result a set of restrictions was imposed on seal hunting near Alaska. Knapp was replaced as governor on August 29, 1893, following the appointment of James Sheakley by President Grover Cleveland.

===Later career===
Following his term as governor, Knapp moved to Seattle and established a law practice. He was active in civil organizations such as the Institute of Civics and National Geographic Society and received an honorary LL.D. from Whitman College in 1893. Knapp was also the founder and president of the Anti-Saloon League of Washington. He remained active in the practice of law until his death on October 9, 1904.

== Personal life ==
On January 23, 1865, Knapp married Martha A Severance of Middlebury, Vermont. The couple had four children.

<text>Alfred Peter Swineford (September 14, 1836 – October 26, 1909) was an American journalist and politician who served as the second Governor of District of Alaska. He trained as a printer, worked in Minnesota and Wisconsin before becoming the editor and publisher of the &quot;Mining Journal&quot; in Marquette, Michigan. From this base he became active in politics and was elected Mayor of Marquette and to a term in the Michigan House of Representatives before his appointment as governor.

==Background==
Swineford was born in Ashland, Ohio, on September 14, 1836. He was educated in local public schools before being apprenticed at age 15 to a printer, first in Ashford and later in Columbus, Ohio. At the end of his apprenticeship, in 1853, he began Albert Lea, Minnesota&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Southern Star&quot;. From there he started the &quot;Banner&quot; in La Crescent before establishing the &quot;Union Democrat&quot; in La Crosse.

In 1860, Swineford sold his interests in his newspapers and moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he published the &quot;Daily Inquirer&quot;. He became head of Oshkosh&#x27;s &quot;Review&quot; in 1864 before moving to Fond du Lac to operate the &quot;Democratic Press&quot; a year later. Swineford moved to Negaunee, Michigan, in 1867 where he joined the &quot;Mining and Manufacturing News&quot;. Following a merger of papers he became editor and publisher of the &quot;Mining Journal&quot; in Marquette. He remained in this position until 1884.

Swineford married Psyche Cyntheria Flower in January 1875 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The marriage produced one daughter before Psyche&#x27;s death in 1881.

==Michigan politics==
While in Michigan, Swineford became active in Democratic politics. In 1871, he was elected to a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives. This was followed by his selection as a delegate to the 1872. The first of time he was selected, he later served as a delegate during the 1884 convention.

In 1883, Swineford was selected as State Commissioner of Mineral Statistics for Michigan. He also made an unsuccessful run for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan that year. He began a two-year term as mayor of Marquette, Michigan, in 1884. Swineford also was Michigan&#x27;s representative to the World Cotton Centennial in New Orleans.

==Alaska==
President Grover Cleveland appointed Swineford as Governor of the District of Alaska on May 9, 1885. He supported granting Alaska territorial status.

Following the inauguration of President William McKinley, Swineford&#x27;s term of office ended on April 20, 1889.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Swineford returned to Michigan. In 1893, with the return of President Cleveland to the White House, many Alaskans hoped the former governor would be reappointed to office. President Cleveland, bowing to special interests opposed to Swineford, instead appointed him Inspector General of the United States General Land Office. In this office he oversaw the 1898 opening of the Cherokee Outlet.

In 1898, Swineford moved back to Alaska. That same year he published the book, &quot;Alaska: Its History, Climate and Natural Resources, Hardcover&quot;. In alignment with his mining interests, he published the &quot;Ketchikan Mining Journal&quot; from 1901 till 1905 and the &quot;Ketchikan Mines&quot; from 1907 till 1908. Swineford died in Juneau, Alaska, on October 26, 1909. He is buried in Juneau at Evergreen Cemetery.

<doc id="990071" wikidata="Q412088" url="?curid=990071" title="Ajatar">
<text>In Finnish folklore, Ajatar (), also spelled Ajattara , Aiätär , or Aijotar ), is an evil female spirit.

==Description==
In Finnish folklore &quot;Ajatar&quot; is an evil female spirit. She lives in the woods located at the mountains of Pohjola; she is described as having &quot;hair-plait reached to her heels and whose breasts hung down to her knees&quot; similar to the Swedish Skogsnufva, Danish &#x27;seawoman&#x27;, or the wildfraulein of the eifel.

Ajatar is the granddaughter of Hiisi (the master of the woods and spreader of disease) and is the master of Lempo and Gnomes. Through her connections with Hiisi and Lempo, she is said to spread disease and pestilence.

She is closely associated with serpents, and is often depicted in modern art as a dragon or half-humanoid and serpentine figure.

== Etymology ==
The word “ajatar” is possibly derived from the Finnish word &quot;ajattaa&quot;, “to pursue&quot; (also, &quot;to drive&quot;). The feminine suffix &quot;“-tar-”&quot; appears in several Finnish names, including a variation of Louhi (Louhetar, Loviatar, Louhiatar) and Syöjätär (&quot;syödä&quot; ‘to eat,’ with the feminine suffix of -&quot;tar&quot;, means ‘devourer, vampire’). Applying this to Ajatar, the verb &quot;ajaa&quot; is suffixed by the feminine &quot;-tar,&quot; translating as “female pursuer.” The name may have its root in &quot;aika&quot; &#x27;time&#x27; as well, from where &quot;ajatar&quot; would be an equally regular derivative. Or both. Aika and ajaa might be etymologically connected through the sense of time, like death, hunting oneself.

==In other media==
===Derivative works===
Although Ajatar does not appear by name in documented Finnish folk songs, she appears in fiction inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and in modern fantasy interpretations.
*In the second act of Aleksis Kivi&#x27;s play, &quot;Kullervo&quot; (1860), Ajatar is described as ferocious and shameless, encouraging the protagonist to kill his master’s family. Ajatar states that she lives in the mountains, has Lempo and Gnomes in her service, and that her mother’s father is Hiisi. Ajatar is further described as “nasty” and compared to a “vicious wife who rejoices in evils.”
*In &quot;The Eye of Disparager: Book One of the Legend of the Bloodstone&quot; written by Brett Stuart Smith, Ajatar is a beautiful woman with the upper body of a green scaled woman and the lower half made up of many snakes. She has serpentine fangs and seductive eyes, and is the mother of all snakes.
*Ajatar is mentioned twice in Matt Smith’s &quot;Big Game: Movie Tie-in Edition&quot;. Smith referred to her as “the Devil of the Woods who appeared as a dragon and made you sick if you so much as looked at her” and later associations a force of nature to her destructive powers.
*Fantasy author, Philip Mazza, portrays the Ajatar as a race of fire breathing dragons, causing pestilence and disease. In his book, &quot;The Harrow: From Under a Tree&quot;, Mazza describes two races of Ajatar, black and red, which fight amongst each other. One race, the black dragons, are evil whereas the red race are described as more benevolent.
*In the novel Beneath The Mantle by Ahimsa Kerp, Ajatar is a secondary antagonist serving Ra, the Sun God.
*The second book, Midnight Oil, of the Compleat and True History of the Witches of Galdorheim series by Marva Dasef describes a confrontation between the evil forest elemental, Ajatar, and her air spirit sister, Ilmatar. Ajatar takes dragon form and Ilmatar that of a white roc in a battle in the skies to settle the dispute between the sisters--over a man, of course.
*In episode 10 of the anime &quot;The Most Notorious &quot;Talker&quot; Runs the World&#x27;s Greatest Clan&quot;, Leon&#x27;s group kills a green ajatar in the form of a forest dragon. This beast had 4 chameleon eyes, powerful arms and strange holes in its chest.

===Christian references===
In some Finnish translations of The Bible the term &quot;ajatar&quot; is used to refer to certain demons or devils :
*In Leviticus [17.7] of the Finnish Bible (1776 ed., see also Bible translations into Finnish), a variation of Ajatar’s name (Ajattaroille = to the Ajattaras/Ajatars) appears to use her as a general devil or demon and not a separate entity. 
::&quot;Ja ei millään muotoa enää uhriansa uhraaman ajattaroille, joiden kanssa he huorin tehneet ovat. Se pitää oleman heille heidän sukukunnissansa ijankaikkinen sääty,&quot;

===Music===
*&quot;Ajatar&quot; by Winter Gardens (2011).
*&quot;Ajatar Rising&quot; by Epic North Music (2013).
*Ajattara, a Finnish Black Metal named after Ajatar.

<text>Nihilist Recordings is a record label that releases noise music albums, and is similar to labels like Load Records and Hanson Records, though it tends to release bands that are more controversial or offensive in a sensational manner. Nihilist manages to separate itself from these labels due to its eclectic roster which spans the genres of neo-folk, acoustic, absurdist, musique concrete and dark disco.
Founded in 1992 with the release of a two cassettes (Pound Of Flesh and Panicsville), though these are not featured in any official discographies making them all the more rare.

The label was founded by Andy Ortmann in St Louis initially to release music by his own band, Panicsville. It has since released albums by major and minor noise artists like Costes, Cock E.S.P., Pound of Flesh, the Broken Penis Orchestra, Mlehst, John Wiese, Andy Ortmann, Brain Transplant, Inflatable Alterboys, Strangulated Beatoffs, Runzelstirn &amp; Gurgelstock, Mammal, Death Squad, Wolf Eyes, Thurston Moore, Nondor Nevai, Fashion Dictator, Schimpfluch Commune and Zipper Spy.

Nihilist also released a trilogy of tribute albums to pop music groups ABBA, Madonna and the B-52&#x27;s.

<doc id="990075" wikidata="Q6822501" url="?curid=990075" title="Metaflow Technologies">
<text>Metaflow Technologies was a microprocessor design company based in La Jolla, California. It was founded in 1988 by Val Popescu, Merle Schultz, Gary Gibson, John Spracklen, and Bruce Lightner.

The company is not well known to the general public as none of its designs were ever manufactured in volume. The company is known within the computer architecture community as it published articles in technical journals in the early 1990s that described how an out-of-order with speculative execution CPU might be designed. This was one of the first publicly disclosed &quot;OoO&quot; designs from a non-academic source.

Described as specialising in VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) technology, this having been licensed to Intel, Metaflow announced a collaboration with LSI Logic and Hyundai to develop a CMOS-based SPARC processor codenamed &quot;Lightning&quot; capable of achieving a performance of 80 MIPS, being around double that of some contemporary SPARC designs. The product itself was a multi-chip processor designed according to the architectural principles previously published by the company. The chips were designed and built by LSI Logic, but that support went away before full production could be reached.

The &quot;Thunder&quot; project was a follow-on that was funded by Hyundai. Hyundai gained control of the company in 1994. This project did not go into production either.

The company was acquired by ST Microelectronics (called SGS Thomson Microelectronics at the time) in 1998. ST Micro originally wanted this design team to work on an Intel IA-32 clone, but eventually the team was used for non-personal computer SOCs.

It is rumored that Metaflow collaborated with the Intel team that would eventually design the Pentium Pro, the first commercially available &quot;Out-of-Order&quot; x86 processor.

Following STMicroelectronics&#x27; acquisition in May 1997 of a majority stake in Metaflow, the relationship between the companies soured. Sources indicate that the two were unable to agree on which direction to take Metaflow&#x27;s technology, creating a rift that resulted in ST&#x27;s buying out Metaflow&#x27;s last remaining founders: President Val Popescu, Vice President Bruce Lightner, and Director of Engineering Gary Gibson. Gibson has since taken a position with Mosart Systems, working on some as-yet-undisclosed new processor.

The originator of much of the technology underlying today&#x27;s superscalar out-of-order microprocessors, Metaflow was never able to reap its just rewards. Begun in 1985, the company&#x27;s first project, a SPARC-based ECL gate-array processor, was supplanted in 1989 by Lightning, a CMOS design backed by funding and IC-design resources from Hyundai. But the division of labor between the two companies proved stormy, and in 1991 Lightning was discharged, creating Thunder—a 0.8-micrometre three-chip processor designed entirely by Metaflow. In 1995, the company successfully demonstrated an 80-MHz Thunder processor—which delivered 2.5 SPECint92/MHz—just as Hyundai decided it wanted x86-based processors instead of SPARCs.

Metaflow had a brush with success in the early 1990s when, working under contract to Intel, it convinced the processor giant that out-of-order design offered the best hope for building fast x86 processors. In fact, sources indicate that inside Intel the P6 was initially referred to as the &quot;Metaflow processor.&quot; Sources have also revealed that Intel actually tried to buy Metaflow, but Andy Grove, unable to come to terms with Hyundai, had to abort the purchase.

Intel subsequently acquired the IP rights to Metaflow&#x27;s technology through a patent cross-license with Hyundai for DRAM technology. The Pentium Pro using a centralized reservation station and instant repair of out-of-order and speculative execution, bears the clear mark of Metaflow¹s involvement. More than 150 Intel patents cite Metaflow intellectual property as prior art. In 1997, frustrated by the inability to control its own IP and thus its own destiny, Metaflow convinced Hyundai to sell out to ST. Since then, ST and Metaflow have been jointly developing an x86-based processor. But, already unhappy with ST&#x27;s plans for that part as well as with its lackluster process technology, Metaflow&#x27;s leaders were pushed over the brink when ST traded Metaflow&#x27;s IP to IBM in an x86-for-PowerPC swap.

Some Metaflow designers continue to work on ST&#x27;s x86 project, but with the leaders gone and ST more interested in the low end of the x86 market, chances are slim that the x86 chip will ever see daylight—especially now that ST has a Pentium-class x86 project under way in India. ST officials declined to comment, other than to acknowledge that ST has indeed taken full ownership of Metaflow and to express confidence in the design team that remains.

<text>The music of the Marshall Islands has a long history. The Marshall Islands are an independent island chain, geographically and culturally part of the Micronesian area. It was part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, governed by the United States, until independence in 1986.

The &quot;roro&quot; is a kind of traditional chant, usually about ancient legends and performed to give guidance during navigation and strength for mothers in labor. Modern bands have blended the unique songs of each island in the country with modern music.

Though drums are not generally common in Micronesian music, one-sided hourglass-shaped drums are a major part of Marshallese music.

The national anthem of the Marshall Islands is &quot;Forever Marshall Islands&quot;,which Amata Kabua wrote the lyrics for.

==Traditional dances==
There is a traditional Marshallese dance called beet, which is influenced by Spanish folk dances. In it, men and women side-step in parallel lines, creating a very difficult and complex rhythm. There is a kind of &quot;stick dance&quot; performed by the Jobwa, nowadays only for very special occasions.
