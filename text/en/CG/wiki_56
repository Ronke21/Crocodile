<text>Andrés Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; González (August 28, 1936 – July 2, 2021) was a Cuban professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds (), Philadelphia Phillies (–), San Diego Padres (), Atlanta Braves (–), and California Angels (–).

== Career ==
A fine center fielder, González spent his best years with the Phillies. He had an average, though accurate, arm with excellent range. As a hitter, González batted for average with occasional power, drew a significant number of walks, was a good bunter, and had enough power to collect an above-average number of doubles and triples. He hit a career-high 20 home runs in ; then, in , González had career-highs in doubles (36) and triples (12), to place third and second, respectively, in the National League (NL). In , his career-high .339 batting average was second only to Roberto Clemente’s .357 for the NL batting crown, which also ranked second in the major leagues.

In his twelve-season MLB career, González hit .286 (1,485-for-5,195), with 103 home runs, 615 runs batted in (RBI), 690 runs, 238 doubles, 57 triples, and 79 stolen bases, in 1,559 games. Defensively, he recorded a .987 fielding percentage, while playing at all three outfield positions.

In the 1969 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, González hit .357, with two RBI, one double, four runs, and one homer (off Tom Seaver). Following his big league career, González played part of the season for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

In total, González made about 5,800 trips to the plate over his major league career (about 4,600 — or 80% — of them against right-handed pitchers and the other 1,200 — or 20% — against left-handers); so, González averaged about 400 plate appearances per year against righties and 100 plate appearances against lefties. In total, he hit .286, with a .350 on-base percentage, and a .413 slugging percentage. But what is striking about González is that he exhibited a rather pronounced platoon-split during his career — that is, being a left-handed batter, he hit right-handed pitchers much better than he hit southpaws. For his career, Gonzalez hit .303 against righties, with a .366 on-base percentage, and a .442 slugging percentage; against lefties, these numbers were only .219/.288/.299. Given that the 1960s were a time of reduced offensive output — due in part to a larger strike zone and 4-man (rather than 5-man) rotations — his performance against righties was exceptional, and if he would have had a right-handed hitting platoon-mate — that could have covered his 100 or so plate appearances against southpaws each year — González might merit consideration as one of the best hitters of the decade.

During the season, González was the first MLB player to wear a batting helmet with a pre-molded ear-flap. He was in the NL top-ten in being hit by pitches, and the special helmet was constructed specifically for his use.

González died on July 2, 2021, at the age of 84.

<text>Durrow () is a small rural village and townland in County Offaly, Ireland. Durrow is located on the N52 off the N6 road between Kilbeggan (in County Westmeath) and Tullamore (in County Offaly).

Durrow Abbey, surrounded by woods, is one of Ireland&#x27;s most important early Christian monasteries founded by Saint Colmcille. 
Some mistakenly assign County Laois as the location of this particular monastic settlement due to the presence of a larger town in Laois called Durrow.

==Monastery==

Iona was established in exile and during that time Colum Cille yearned for monasteries in Ireland. The poem &#x27;An Exile&#x27;s Dream&#x27; specifically indicates Durrow as location for a monastery. Durrow was then part of the territory of Tethba, which now lies mostly in County Longford. It was also located near one of Ireland&#x27;s five ancient routes, Slighe Mór. However, no accounts survive of what Colum Cille&#x27;s monastery was like at its foundation. The monastic enclosure of Durrow can be seen in the aerial photographs of the surrounding lands. South of the monastery is evidence of Early Christian burials, unearthed by excavation of burial mounds by the National Museum of Ireland. Bede mentions that many more monasteries sprang from Durrow. 

==Control==
Patronage shifted during the millennium that followed the monastery&#x27;s establishment. The Kings of Meath, Kings of Tethba and the MacGeoghegans, as well as chieftains known as Cinél Fiachach supported the monastery. This support did not permit them to appoint its abbot, who was selected from Colum Cille&#x27;s own extended family at the start. Later rule of the Columban monasteries would be dominated by certain families who became hereditary rulers forming ecclesiastical dynasties.

Uí Néill association was also important and in 763 Domnall, King of Meath, was buried in the graveyard of Durrow. In 764 a war was fought with Clonmacnoise over burial rights, particularly the burial site of future Kings of Meath and in 776 the men of Durrow were involved in a raid upon Munster.

<doc id="991504" wikidata="Q2672393" url="?curid=991504" title="Stradbally">
<text>Stradbally () is a town in County Laois, Ireland.

==Overview==
It is located in the midlands of Ireland along the N80 road, about from Portlaoise and from Dublin. It is a townland, a civil parish, and historic barony.

It is known for its annual Steam Rally and the Electric Picnic music festival.

==History==
The history of Stradbally dates to the 6th century. The area was called &quot;Mon-au-Bealing&quot; and Colman Mac ua Laoise, a disciple of St. Columba, established a monastery at Oughaval, close to the town and within the present-day parish.

In 1447 Franciscans came to Mon-au-Bealing and by 1550 a small village had developed. The name Stradbally (Sraidbhaile Laoise) was in use at least from the 16th century as it is referred to by that name in the Annals of the Four Masters.

Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (published in 1837) records that the parish at that time contained &quot;2392 inhabitants, of which number, 1799 are in the town&quot;.

==Birth of motor racing==
On 2 July 1903 the Gordon Bennett Cup ran through Stradbally. It was the first international motor race to be held in Ireland. Kildare was chosen at least partly on the grounds that the straightness of the roads would be a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green.

The route consisted of several loops of a route which included Kilcullen, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally, Athy, Castledermot, and Carlow. The race was won by the Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes.

==Demography==
The population has risen steadily over the past few years;
*2006: 1056
*2011: 1154
*2016: 1350
*2022: 1404

In 2016, the population was 97% Irish or British, 2% European and 1% non-European.

Among the residents, 62% are able to speak Irish.

==Events==

===Steam rally===

Stradbally is known for its Steam Rally, an annual gathering of enthusiasts of steam-powered vehicles, held in the grounds of the Cosby estate at Stradbally Hall every August bank holiday weekend. It is the oldest steam rally in Ireland and is supported by the Irish Steam Preservation Society.

Traction engines and other steam-powered vehicles are brought to the rally and displayed and demonstrated, and a steam railway offers rides along a short track.

Harold Condell and several others co-founded the Irish Steam Preservation Society. It also operates narrow gauge steam railway in the grounds of Stradbally Hall. There is also a Steam Museum in Stradbally Town.

Stradbally is steeped in steam history since the post industrial revolution. Steam traction engines were in abundance in Stradbally after the turn of the last century. Families who had threshing sets and steam engines included the Fennelly family of Market Square, Farrelly family, Cole&#x27;s of Riverside, Condell&#x27;s of Old Mills (Whitefields), and one family which is still keeping the tradition going are the Deegan&#x27;s of Kylebeg and now Brockley whom to this day perform the annual threshing at the Steam Rally.

===Stradbally Woodland Railway===

Close to the area where the annual rally is held is a Steam railway which is operated by volunteers of the Irish Steam Preservation Society. It began with the acquisition, in 1966, of one of the Guinness company&#x27;s steam engines, No 15 built in 1895 along with a few coaches. In 1969 it was replaced by a then surplus steam locomotive, part of BNM&#x27;s failed experiment in Steam Traction, No2/LM44, built in 1949. The line was changed to narrow gauge and has been steadily expanded to a balloon loop since. It has since acquired several diesel locomotives. ESB Ruston, Serial 326052, No 4, affectionately known as &quot;Rusty&quot; is the railway&#x27;s Permanent Way locomotive and supplants No 2 from time to time and Planet, works no. 2014 &quot;Nippy&quot;, the oldest operational Diesel locomotive in Ireland. The railway also showcases a 1949-built Andrew Barclay 0-4-0WT No 2/LM44, nicknamed &quot;Róisín&quot;.

The railway runs every bank holiday weekend throughout the year.

===Electric Picnic===

The Electric Picnic is an annual arts-and-music festival which has been staged in late August / early September since 2004 at Stradbally Hall in Stradbally. It is organised by Pod Concerts and Festival Republic. The Electric Picnic won eight awards in Hot Press&#x27;s 2011 Festival Awards, including &#x27;Best Large Festival&#x27;. In 2023, it was awarded &#x27;Festival of the Year&#x27; in the Ticketmaster Awards.

==Religion==

The Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart is a Gothic Revival church which was completed in 1896 to a cruciform plan. It was designed by William Hague.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church, also a Gothic Revival church, built in 1764, with one tower. During renovations around 1880 a projecting porch, chancel and vestry were added.

Saint Colman&#x27;s Orthodox Church, of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, is located on the Abbeyleix Road, approximately one mile outside Stradbally.

==Sport==
Local sports clubs include Stradbally GAA club (the local GAA club), and Stradbally Town A.F.C. (an association football (soccer) club).

==Notable people==
* Colm Begley, Australian rules and Gaelic football player
* Cecil Day-Lewis late Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom and father of actor Daniel Day-Lewis
* Delaney Brothers, after whom the Leinster Senior Football Trophy is named
* Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, Irish politician, was from Stradbally

==Notes==

a. According to &quot;Leinster Leader&quot;, Saturday, 11 April 1903 , Britain had to choose a different colour to its usual national colours of red, white and blue, as these had already been taken by Italy, Germany and France respectively. It also stated red as the color for &quot;American&quot; cars in the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup.

<text>Andrew Leipus (born 9 January 1970, Adelaide, Australia) is a physiotherapist.

Since October 1999, he has worked for the Board of Control for Cricket in India as the physiotherapist of the Indian national cricket team.

Leipus retired at the end of 2004. He was credited for substantially upgrading the Cricket team&#x27;s medical conditions and treatment. In addition to improving facilities and treatment options (he legendarily found on his first day that the team&#x27;s first aid kit was out of Band-Aids), he encouraged the team to start training in gyms. These training sessions led to a great improvement in the team&#x27;s fitness level and, eventually, its level of play.

In cricket-crazy India, Leipus became a media fixture whenever key players suffered injuries. Media pressure is said to be one of the reasons Leipus declined to renew his contract. He was replaced by John Gloster. He is now contracted with the Indian Premier League team Rajasthan Royals as its physiotherapist
In 2017, he was named as physiotherapist of Multan Sultans in Pakistan Super League.

<text>The [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]]al [[history of Canada]] begins with the 1763 Treaty of Paris, in which France ceded most of New France to Great Britain. Canada was the colony along the St Lawrence River, part of present-day Ontario and Quebec. Its government underwent many structural changes over the following century. In 1867 Canada became the name of the new federal Dominion extending ultimately from the Atlantic to the Pacific and the Arctic coasts. Canada obtained legislative autonomy from the United Kingdom in 1931, and had its constitution (including a new rights charter) patriated in 1982. Canada&#x27;s constitution includes the amalgam of constitutional law spanning this history.

== Treaty of Paris (1763) ==
On February 10, 1763, France ceded most of New France to Great Britain. The 1763 Treaty of Paris confirmed the cession of Canada, including all its dependencies, Acadia (Nova Scotia) and Cape Breton Island to Great Britain. A year before, France had secretly signed a treaty ceding Louisiana to Spain to avoid losing it to the British.

At the time of the signing, the French colony of Canada was already under the control of the British army since the capitulation of the government of New France in 1760. (See the Articles of Capitulation of Montreal.)

== Royal proclamation (1763) ==

The policy of Great Britain regarding its newly acquired colonies of America was revealed in a Royal Proclamation, issued on October 7, 1763. The proclamation renamed Canada &quot;The Province of Quebec&quot;, redefined its borders and established a British-appointed colonial government. Although not an act of Parliament, the proclamation expressed the will of the British Crown to govern its new possessions. The proclamation was thus considered constitution of Quebec until the passing of the Quebec Act, by which the colony was granted a legislature. The new governor of the colony was given &quot;the power and direction to summon and call a general assembly of the people&#x27;s representatives&quot; when the &quot;state and circumstances of the said Colonies will admit thereof&quot;.

The governor was also given the mandate to &quot;make, constitute, and ordain Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances for the Public Peace, Welfare, and good Government of our said Colonies, and of the People and Inhabitants thereof&quot; with the consent of the British-appointed councils and representatives of the people. In the meantime, all British subjects in the colony were guaranteed of the protection of the law of England, and the governor was given the power to erect courts of judicature and public justice to hear all causes, civil or public.

The Royal Proclamation contained elements that conflicted with the &quot;Articles of Capitulation of Montreal&quot;, which granted Canadians the privilege to maintain their civil laws and practise their religion. The application of British laws such as the penal Laws caused numerous administrative problems and legal irregularities. The requirements of the Test Act also effectively excluded Catholics from administrative positions in the British Empire.

When James Murray was commissioned as captain general and governor in chief of the Province of Quebec, a four-year military rule ended, and the civil administration of the colony began. Judging the circumstances to be inappropriate to the establishment of British institutions in the colony, Murray was of the opinion that it would be more practical to keep the current civil institutions. He believed that, over time, the Canadians would recognize the superiority of British civilization and willingly adopt its language, its religion, and its customs. He officially recommended to retain French civil law and to dispense the Canadians from taking the Oath of Supremacy. Nevertheless, Murray followed his instructions and British institutions began to be established. On September 17, 1764, the Courts of the King&#x27;s Bench and Common Pleas were constituted.

Tensions quickly developed between the British merchants or old subjects, newly established in the colony, and Governor Murray. They were very dissatisfied with the state of the country and demanded that British institutions be created immediately. They demanded that common law be enforced to protect their business interests and that a house of assembly be created for English-speaking Protestants alone. Murray did not think very highly of these tradesmen. In a letter to the British Lords of Trade, he referred to them as &quot;licentious fanatics&quot; who would not be satisfied but by &quot;the expulsion of the Canadians&quot;.

The conciliatory approach of Murray in dealing with the demands of the Canadians was not well received by the merchants. In May 1764, they petitioned the king for Murray&#x27;s removal, accusing him of betraying the interests of Great Britain by his defence of the Canadian people&#x27;s interests. The merchants succeeded in having him recalled to London. He was vindicated, but did not return to the Province of Quebec. In 1768, he was replaced by Sir Guy Carleton, who would contribute to the drafting of the 1774 Quebec Act.

Murray called in the representatives of the people in 1765; however, his attempt to constitute a representative assembly failed, as, according to historian Francois-Xavier Garneau, the Canadians were unwilling to renounce their Catholic faith and take the test oath required to hold office.

=== Restoration movement (1764–1774) ===

On October 29, 1764, 94 Canadian subjects submitted a petition demanding that the orders of the king be available in French and that they be allowed to participate in the government.

In December 1773, Canadian landlords submitted a petition and a memorandum in which they asked:

* That the ancient laws, privileges, and customs be restored in full
* That the province be extended to its former boundaries
* That the law of Britain be applied to all subjects without distinction

They expressed their opinion that the time was not right for a house of assembly because the colony could not afford it and suggested that a larger council, composed of both new and old subjects, would be a better choice.

In May 1774 the British merchants trading in Quebec responded by submitting their case to the king.

=== Reform movement (1765–1791) ===

As early as 1765, British merchants established in Quebec City addressed a petition to the King to ask for &quot;the establishment of a house of representatives in this province as in all the other provinces&quot; of the continent. Indeed, all the other colonies of British America had parliamentary institutions, even Nova Scotia, which obtained its Parliament in 1758.

The movement for reform did not receive any support from the Canadians originally.

== Quebec Act (1774) ==
The Quebec Act granted many of the requests of the Canadians. Enacted on June 13, 1774, the act changed the following:

* The boundaries of the Province of Quebec were greatly expanded to the west and south. The territory now covered the whole of the Great Lakes Basin.
* The free practice of the Catholic faith was confirmed. The Roman Catholic Church was officially recognized and permitted to operate under British sovereignty.
* The Canadians were dispensed of the test oath, which was replaced by an oath to George III that had no reference to Protestantism. This made it possible for Canadians to hold positions in the colonial administration.
* French civil law was fully restored and British criminal law was established. The seigneurial method of land tenancy was thus maintained.
* A British criminal code was established.

No assembly of representatives was created, which allowed the governor to keep ruling under the advice of his counsellors.

The British merchants of Quebec were not pleased by this new act, which ignored their most important demands. They continued to campaign to abolish the current civil code and establish a house of assembly excluding Catholics and French-speakers.

The Quebec Act was also very negatively received in the British colonies to the south. (See the Intolerable Acts.) This act was in force in the Province of Quebec when the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775.

=== Letters to the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec (1774-1775) ===

During the revolution, the Continental Congress attempted to rally the Canadian people to its cause. The delegates wrote three letters (Letters to the inhabitants of Canada) inviting them to join in the revolution. The letters circulated in Canada, mostly in the cities of Montreal and Quebec. The first letter was written on October 26, 1774, and signed by the president of the congress, Henry Middleton. It was translated into French by Fleury Mesplet, who printed it in Philadelphia and distributed the copies himself in Montreal.

The letter pleaded the cause of democratic government, the separation of powers, taxation power, habeas corpus, trial by jury, and freedom of the press.

The second letter was written on May 25, 1775. Shorter, it urged the inhabitants of Canada not to side against the revolutionary forces. (The congress was aware that the British colonial government had already asked the Canadians to resist the call of the revolutionaries.)

On May 22, 1775, Bishop of Quebec Jean-Olivier Briand sent out a &quot;mandement&quot; asking the Canadians to close their ears to the call of the &quot;rebels&quot; and defend their country and their king against the invasion.

Although both the British and the revolutionaries succeeded at recruiting Canadian men for militia, the majority of the people chose not to get involved in the conflict.

In 1778, Frederick Haldimand became governor in replacement of Guy Carleton. (He served up until 1786, when Guy Carleton (now Lord Dorchester) returned as governor.)

=== Resumption of the reform movement (1784) ===
Soon after the war, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the constitutional question resurfaced.

In July 1784, Pierre du Calvet, a rich French merchant established in Montreal, published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Appel à la justice de l&#x27;État&quot; (Call to the Justice of the State) in London. Printed in French, the document is the first plea in favour of a constitutional reform in Canada. Du Calvet, imprisoned at the same time and for the same reasons as Fleury Mesplet and Valentine Jautard, both suspected of sympathizing and collaborating with the American revolutionaries during the war, undertook to have the injustice committed towards him be publicly known by publishing &quot;The Case of Peter du Calvet&quot; and, a few months later, his &quot;Appel à la justice de l&#x27;État&quot;.

On November 24, 1784, two petition for a house of assembly, one signed by 1436 &quot;New Subjects&quot; (Canadians) and another signed by 855 &quot;Old Subjects&quot; (British), were sent to the king of Great Britain. The first petition contained 14 demands. &quot;A Plan for a House of Assembly&quot; was also sketched in the same month of November. In December, &quot;An Address to His Majesty in opposition to the House of Assembly and a list of Objections&quot; were printed by the press of Fleury Mesplet in Montreal. The main objection to the house of assembly was that the colony was not, according to its signatories, in a position to be taxed.

At the time the November 24 petition was submitted to the king, numerous United Empire Loyalists were already seeking refuge in Quebec and Nova Scotia. In Quebec, the newly arrived settlers contributed to increase the number of people voicing for a rapid constitutional reform. In Nova Scotia, the immigrants demanded a separate colony.

=== Parliamentary constitution project (1789) ===

In 1786, the British government appointed Guy Carleton, as &quot;governor-in-chief&quot; and also governor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John&#x27;s Island (present-day Prince Edward Island). Carleton, now Lord Dorchester, had been British commander in Canada and governor of Quebec during the American Revolutionary War. When he returned as governor, he was already informed that the arrival of the Loyalists would require changes.

On October 20, 1789, Home Secretary William Wyndham Grenville wrote a private and secret letter to Carleton, informing him of the plans of the king&#x27;s counsellors to modify Canada&#x27;s constitution. The letter leaves little doubt as to the influence that American independence and the taking of the Bastille (which had just occurred in July) had on the decision. In the first paragraph, Grenville writes: &quot;I am persuaded that it is a point of true Policy to make these Concessions at a time when they may be received as matter of favour, and when it is in Our own power to regulate and direct the manner of applying them, rather than to wait &#x27;till they shall be extorted from Us by a necessity which shall neither leave Us any discretion in the form, nor any merit in the substance of what we give.&quot;

Grenville prepared the constitution in August 1789. But he was appointed to the House of Lords before he could submit his project to the House of Commons. Thus, Prime Minister William Pitt did it in his place.

British merchants established in Quebec sent Adam Lymburner to Britain to present their objections. They objected to the creation of two provinces, suggested an increase in the number of representatives, asked for elections every three years (instead of seven), and requested an electoral division which would have overrepresented the Old Subjects by granting more representatives to the populations of the cities.

Lymburner&#x27;s revisions were opposed by Whigs such as Charles James Fox, and in the end only the suggestions related to the frequency of elections and the number of representatives were retained.

== Constitutional Act (1791) ==
On June 10, 1791, the Constitutional Act was enacted in London and gave Canada its first parliamentary constitution. Containing 50 articles, the act brought the following changes:

* The Province of Quebec was divided into two distinct provinces, Province of Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) and Province of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario).
* Each province was given an elected Legislative Assembly, an appointed Legislative Council, and an appointed Executive Council.
* Upper Canada was to be administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the governor general, while Lower Canada was to be administered by a direct representative of the governor general.
* The Legislative Councils were to be established with no fewer than seven members in Upper Canada and fifteen members in Lower Canada. The members were to hold their seat for life.
* The Legislative Assembly was to be established with no less than sixteen members in Upper Canada and fifty members in Lower Canada.
* The governor was given the power to appoint the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, to fix the time and place of the elections and to give or withhold assent to bills.
* Provisions were made to allot clergy reserves to the Protestant churches in each province.

This partition ensured that Loyalists would constitute a majority in Upper Canada and allow for the application of exclusively British laws in this province. As soon as the province was divided, a series of acts were passed to abolish the French civil code in Upper Canada. In Lower Canada, the coexistence of French civil law and English criminal law continued.

Although it solved the immediate problems related to the settlement of the Loyalists in Canada, the new constitution brought a whole new set of political problems which were rooted in the constitution. Some of these problems were common to both provinces, while others were unique to Lower Canada or Upper Canada. The problems that eventually affected both provinces were:

* The Legislative Assemblies did not have full control over the revenues of the provinces
* The Executive and Legislative Councils were not responsible to the Legislative Assembly

In the two provinces, a movement for constitutional reform took shape within the majority party, the of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada. Leader of the Parti Canadien, Pierre-Stanislas Bédard was the first politician of Lower Canada to formulate a project of reform to put an end to the opposition between the elected Legislative Assembly and the Governor and his Council which answered only the Colonial Office in London. Putting forward the idea of ministerial responsibility, he proposed that the members of the Legislative Council be appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the elected House.

=== Union Bill (1822) ===
In 1822, the Secretary of Colonial Office Lord Bathurst and his under-secretary Robert John Wilmot-Horton secretly submitted a bill to British House of Commons which projected the legislative union of the two Canadian provinces. Two months after the adjournment of the discussions on the bill, the news arrived in Lower Canada and caused a sharp reaction.

Supported by Governor Dalhousie, anglophone petitioners from the Eastern Townships, Quebec City and Kingston, the bill submitted in London provided, among other things, that each of the two sections of the new united province would have a maximum of 60 representatives, which would have put the French-speaking majority of Lower Canada in a position of minority in the new Parliament.

The mobilization of the citizens of Lower Canada and Upper Canada began in late summer and petitions in opposition to the project were prepared. The subject was discussed as soon as the session at the Parliament of Lower Canada opened on January 11, 1823. Ten days later, on January 21, the Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution authorizing a Lower Canadian delegation to go to London in order to officially present the quasi-unanimous opposition of the representatives of Lower Canada to the project of union. Exceptionally, even the Legislative Council gave its support to this resolution, with a majority of one vote. Having in their possession a petition of some 60 000 signatures, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Louis-Joseph Papineau, as well as John Neilson, Member of Parliament, went to London to present the opinion of the majority of the population which they represented.

Faced with the massive opposition of people most concerned with the bill, the British government finally gave up the union project submitted for adoption by its own Colonial Office.

=== Report of the Special Committee of the House of Commons (1828) ===
A Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Civil Government of Canada was appointed on May 2, 1828 &quot;to enquire into the state of the civil government of Canada, as established by the Act 31 Geo. III., chap. 31, and to report their observations and opinions thereupon to the house.&quot;

It reported on July 22 of the same year. It recommended against the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada and in favour of constitutional and administrative reforms intended to prevent the recurrence of the abuses complained of in Lower Canada.

=== The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (1834) ===
These constituted a sort of declaration of rights on the part of the patriote party. They were drafted by A. N. Morin, but were inspired by Louis-Joseph Papineau. They demanded the application of the elective principle to the political institutions of the province, after the American model; but did not advocate, in any explicit way, the introduction of responsible government. Lord Aylmer, the governor-general of Canada at that time, in an analysis of the resolutions, maintained that &quot;eleven of them represented the truth; six contained truth mixed with falsehood; sixteen were wholly false; seventeen were doubtful; twelve were ridiculous; seven repetitions; fourteen consisted of abuse; four were both false and seditious; and the remaining five were indifferent.&quot;

=== Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects of Lower Canada (1835) ===
Following the adoption of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, the Governor Gosford arrived in Lower Canada to replace governor Aylmer. Gosford set up royal commission of inquiry conducted by Charles E. Gray and George Gipps. The Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects of Lower Canada reported on November 17, 1836, and the Ten resolutions of John Russel were mostly based on it.

=== John Russell&#x27;s Ten Resolutions (1837) ===
On March 2, 1837, John Russell, the British Colonial Secretary, submitted ten resolutions to the Parliament in response to the ninety-two resolutions. The Parliament adopted the resolutions on March 6.

Most of the recommendations brought forth by the elected assemblies were systematically ignored by the Executive Councils. This was particularly true in Lower Canada with an assembly consisting mostly of French-Canadian members of the Parti Patriote. This impasse created considerable tensions between the French-Canadian political class and the British government. In 1834 Louis-Joseph Papineau, a French-Canadian political leader, submitted a document entitled the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Crown. The document requested vast democratic reforms such as the transfer of power to elected representatives. The reply came three years later in the form of the Russell Resolutions, which not only rejected the 92 Resolutions but also revoked one of the assembly&#x27;s few real powers, the power to pass its own budget. This rebuff heightened tensions and escalated into armed rebellions in 1837 and 1838, known as the Lower Canada Rebellion. The uprisings were short-lived, however, as British troops quickly defeated the rebels and burned their villages in reprisal.

The rebellion was also contained by the Catholic clergy, which, by representing the only French-Canadian institution with independent authority, exercised a tremendous influence over its constituents. During and after the rebellions Catholic priests and the bishop of Montreal told their congregants that questioning established authority was a sin that would prevent them from receiving the sacraments. The Church refused to give Christian burials to supporters of the rebellion. With liberal and progressive forces suppressed in Lower Canada, the Catholic Church&#x27;s influence dominated the French-speaking side of French Canadian/British relations from the 1840s until the Quiet Revolution secularized Quebec society in the 1960s.

=== Suspension of the Constitutional Act (1838) ===
Approximately four months after having proclaimed martial law in the district of Montreal, Governor Gosford suspended, on March 27, 1838, the Constitutional Act of 1791 and set up a Special Council.

=== Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839) ===
Following the rebellions, in May 1838, the British government sent Governor General Lord Durham to Lower and Upper Canada in order to investigate the uprisings and to bring forth solutions. His recommendations were formulated in what is known as &quot;Lord Durham&#x27;s Report&quot; and suggested the forced union of the Canadas with the expressed purpose of &quot;making [Lower Canada] an English Province [that] should never again be placed in any hands but those of an English population.&quot; Doing so, he claimed, would speed up the assimilation of the French-Canadian population, &quot;a people with no history, and no literature&quot; into a homogenized English population. This would prevent what he considered to be ethnic conflicts.

== Act of Union (1840) ==
Following the publication of the Report on the Affairs of British North America, the British Parliament adopted, in June 1840, the Act of Union. The new Act, which effected the legislative union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada to form a single province named the Province of Canada, implemented the principal recommendation of John George Lambton&#x27;s report, but did not grant a &quot;responsible government&quot; to the new political entity. Entering into force as of February 1841, the 62 articles of the Act of Union brought about the following changes:

* The provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada were unified to form the Province of Canada;
* The parliamentary institutions of the former provinces were abolished and replaced by a single Parliament of Canada;
* Each of the two sections of the province corresponding to the old provinces were allotted an equal number of elected representatives;
* The old electoral districts were redrawn in order to overrepresent the population of former Upper Canada and underrepresent the population of former Lower Canada;
* The candidates to the legislative elections had to prove from then on that they were the owners of a land worth at least 500 pounds sterling;
* The mandates, proclamations, laws, procedures and journals had from then on to be published and archived in the English language only;

As a result, Lower Canada and Upper Canada, with its enormous debt, were united in 1840, and French was banned in the legislature for about eight years. Eight years later, an elected and responsible government was granted. By this time, the French-speaking majority of Lower Canada had become a political minority in a unified Canada. This, as Lord Durham had recommended in his report, resulted in English political control over the French-speaking part of Canada, and ensured the colony&#x27;s loyalty to the British crown. On the other hand, continual legislative deadlock between English and French led to a movement to replace unitary government with a federal one. This movement culminated in Canadian Confederation.

=== Ministerial responsibility (1848) ===

Ministerial responsibility, the principal object of parliamentary struggles conducted by the Parti Canadien in Lower Canada and the Reformers in Upper Canada, becomes a reality in 1848, when Governor Lord Elgin agreed to let the leaders of the majority parties in Canada-East and the Canada-West, Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin, form their own Executive Council. The Province of Canada therefore had its first government made up of members taken in the elected House of Assembly. This important change occurred a few months after Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir John Harvey, let James Boyle Uniacke form his own government. Nova Scotia thus became the first colony of the British Empire to have a government comparable to that of Great Britain itself.

=== Confederation projects (1858–1864) ===
In 1858, Joseph-Charles Taché, doctor and journalist from Quebec City, published a detailed project of federation. It was the first time that a project of this type was presented publicly since the proposal that John A. Roebuck had made in the same direction to John George Lambton while he was a governor of the Canadas in 1838.

The same year, Alexander T. Galt, Member of Parliament for Sherbrooke, agreed to become a Minister of Finance in the Macdonald-Cartier government provided that his own project of confederation is accepted.

== British North America Act (1867) ==

The British North America Act 1867 was the act that established Canada, by the confederation of the North American British colonies of the Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The former subdivisions of Canada were renamed from Canada West and Canada East to the Province of Ontario and Province of Quebec, respectively. Quebec and Ontario were given equal footing with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the Parliament of Canada. This was done to counter the claims of manifest destiny made by the United States, for the defence of Britain&#x27;s holdings. American claims are evinced by the invasions of the Canadas during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.

Prior to the BNA Act of 1867, the British colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, discussed the possibility of a fusion to counter the threat of American annexation, and to reduce the costs of governance. The Province of Canada entered these negotiations at the behest of the British government, and this led to the ambivalence of Prince Edward Island, which delayed joining the new Dominion until 1873. The constitutional conference, ironically, was held on Prince Edward Island, in Charlottetown. Newfoundland also participated (at the Quebec Conference) and likewise declined to join.

=== Province of Manitoba (1870) ===

On May 12, 1870, the British Crown proclaimed the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;, enacted by the Parliament of Canada, effectively giving birth to the province of Manitoba. The 36 articles of the act established the territorial limits, the subjects&#x27; right to vote, the representation in the Canadian House of Commons, the number of senators, the provincial legislature, permitted the use of English and French in the Parliament and in front of the courts and authorized the setting-up of a denominational education system.

The coexistence, on the territory of the province, of French-speaking and Catholic communities (the Métis) as well as English-speaking and Protestant communities (British and Anglo-Canadian immigrants) explains the institutional arrangement copied from that of Quebec.

=== Province of British Columbia (1871) ===

=== Province of Prince Edward Island (1873) ===

=== Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta (1905) ===

=== Statute of Westminster (1931) ===
Canada and the other British dominions achieved full legislative sovereignty with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, but prior to the Canada Act 1982 the British North America Acts were excluded from the operation of the Statute of Westminster and could only be amended by the British Parliament.

=== Royal Commission on Dominion–Provincial Relations (1937) ===
=== Province of Newfoundland (1949) ===

=== Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems (1953) ===
=== The Quiet Revolution (1960s) ===
In the early 1960s, the Quiet Revolution, stemming from a new assertiveness and a heightened sense of national identity among Québécois, dramatically changed the face of Quebec&#x27;s institutions. The new provincial government headed by Jean Lesage and operating under the slogans &quot;Il faut que ça change!&quot; and &quot;Maître chez nous&quot; (&quot;It must change!&quot;, &quot;Masters in our own house&quot;) secularized government institutions, nationalized electricity production and encouraged unionization. The reforms sought to redefine the relations between the vastly working-class francophone Québécois and the mostly anglophone business class. Thus passive Catholic nationalism stylized by Father Lionel Groulx gave way to a more active pursuit of independence, and in 1963 the first bombings by the Front de libération du Québec occurred. The FLQ&#x27;s violent pursuit of a socialist and independent Quebec culminated in the 1970 kidnappings of British diplomat, James Cross and then the provincial minister of labour, Pierre Laporte in what is known as the October Crisis.

The Quiet Revolution also forced the evolution of several political parties, and so, in 1966, a reformed Union Nationale led by Daniel Johnson, Sr., returned to power under the slogan &quot;Equality or Independence&quot;. The new premier of Quebec stated, &quot;As a basis for its nationhood, Quebec wants to be master of its own decision-making in what concerns the human growth of its citizens—that is to say education, social security and health in all their aspects—their economic affirmation—the power to set up economic and financial institutions they feel are required—their cultural development—not only the arts and letters, but also the French language—and the Quebec community&#x27;s external development—its relations with certain countries and international bodies&quot;.

=== Fulton Formula (1961) ===
The Fulton Formula was named for federal Minister of Justice E. Davie Fulton. It proposed an amending formula that included unanimous consent of Parliament and all provinces for select areas of jurisdiction, the consent of Parliament and of the provinces concerned for provisions affecting one or more, but not all of the provinces, the consent of Parliament and of all the provinces except Newfoundland in matters of education, and the consent of Parliament and of the legislature of Newfoundland in matters of education in that province. For all other amendments, consent of Parliament and of at least two-thirds of the provincial legislatures representing at least 50 per cent of the population of Canada would be required. Agreement amongst the provinces was not achieved and the proposal was not implemented, but it was revived again with the Fulton-Favreau Formula in 1964, and several components were included in the Constitution Act, 1982.

=== Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963) ===
For the federal government this demand for an enormous shift in power to a province done under a threat of a possible unilateral declaration of independence, was cause for great alarm. In 1967, on the initiative of Premier John Robarts of Ontario, a provincial first ministers&#x27; conference was held in Toronto to discuss the Canadian confederation of the future. From this, a first round of what would become annual constitutional meetings of all provincial premiers and the prime minister of Canada, was held in February 1968. On the initiative of Prime Minister Lester Pearson the conference undertook to address the desires of Quebec. Amongst numerous initiatives, the conference members examined the recommendations of a Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission, the question of a Charter of Rights, regional disparities, and the timelines of a general review of the constitution (the British North America Act).

In 1968, René Lévesque&#x27;s Mouvement souveraineté-association joined forces with the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale and the Ralliement national to create the Parti Québécois; Quebec&#x27;s provincial political party that has since espoused the province&#x27;s sovereignty. That same year, Pierre Trudeau became prime minister of Canada by winning the leadership race of the federal Liberal Party. He would undertake numerous legislative measures to enhance the status of Quebec within Canada, including the passage into law in 1969 of the Official Languages Act, which expanded upon the original official language status of both French and English from the 1867 British North America Act.

=== Fulton-Favreau Formula (1964) ===
The Fulton–Favreau formula was a proposed formula of amendment of the Constitution of Canada developed by federal justice minister E. Davie Fulton and Quebec Liberal Guy Favreau in the 1960s and approved at a federal-provincial conference in 1965. The formula would have achieved the patriation of the Constitution. Under the formula, all provinces would have to approve amendments that would be relevant to provincial jurisdiction, including the use of the French and English languages, but only the relevant provinces would be needed to approve amendments concerned with a particular region of Canada. The provinces would have been given the right to enact laws amending their respective constitutions, except for provisions concerning the office of Lieutenant Governor. Two-thirds of the provinces representing half of the population, as well as the federal Parliament, would be needed for amendments regarding education. The formula officially died in 1965 when Quebec Premier Jean Lesage withdrew his support. Modified versions re-emerged in the Victoria Charter (1971) and in the Constitution Act, 1982.

=== Victoria Charter (1971) ===

The 1971 Victoria Conference, a meeting between the federal government and the provinces, brought about the Victoria Charter. This Charter sought to establish a formula for amending the Constitution without requiring the unanimous consent of the provinces. Notably, it would give a veto to any province having or having ever had 25 percent of the Canadian population, thus essentially giving Quebec and Ontario veto powers. The provinces were supposed to confirm their acceptance by June 28, 1971, but a change of premiers in Saskatchewan and the reluctance of the federal government to recommend the Charter to Quebec&#x27;s legislature, due to deficiencies in the clauses dealing with income security, led to the failure of this initiative.

===Bill C-60, the Constitutional Amendment Bill===

Bill C-60 was tabled in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister It contained a guarantee of &quot;the right of the individual to the use and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with law.&quot; This language was contentious, especially in PEI. and as a result, Bill C-60 was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, prior to passage. The reference contained questions on the Senate. The SCC ruled, in Re British North America Act and the Federal Senate (1979), 30 NR 271, that the federal government could act in matters related to section 91.1 of the British North America Act only with regards to matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction. The government chose to discontinue Bill C-60 as a result of this decision.

=== Referendum on Sovereignty-Association (1980) ===
In 1976 the Parti Québécois won the provincial election in Quebec with a 41.4 per cent to 33.8 per cent margin over the Parti libéral du Québec, and in the 1980 Quebec referendum the Parti Québécois sought a mandate from the people of Quebec to negotiate new terms of association with the rest of Canada. With an 84-per-cent voter turnout, 60 per cent of Quebec voters rejected the proposal.

After the 1980 referendum was defeated, the government of Quebec passed Resolution 176, which stated, &quot;A lasting solution to the constitutional issue presupposes recognition of the Quebec-Canada duality.&quot;

Meeting in Ottawa on June 9, 1980, the newly re-appointed Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the provincial premiers set an agenda and gave their ministers responsibility for constitutional issues and a mandate to proceed with exploratory discussions to create a new Canadian constitution. However, given the separatist government of Quebec&#x27;s position that there be two nations established first in accordance with Resolution 176, approval by Quebec of any changes to the BNA Act was impossible. This assertion of national duality was immediately followed with Resolution 177 that stated, &quot;Quebec will never agree, under the existing system, to the patriation of the Constitution and to an amending formula as long as the whole issue of the distribution of powers has not been settled and Quebec has not been guaranteed all the powers it needs for its development.&quot; As such, Quebec&#x27;s government refused to approve the new Canadian constitution a year later. This failure to approve was a highly symbolic act, but one without direct legal consequence as no one questions the authority of the Canadian Constitution within Quebec.

After losing the vote to secede from Canada, the government of Quebec made specific demands as minimum requirements for the Province of Quebec. These demands included control by the government of Quebec over:
* the highest court in the province, replacing the Supreme Court of Canada with the Quebec Court of Appeals;
* language and education;
* economic development;
* communications including cable television, radio, and satellite;
* natural resources, including oil and gas;
* all forms of taxation, except customs duties;
* tourism;
* fisheries, including a partitioning of the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Atlantic Provinces;
* scientific research;
* recreation;
* prisons;
* labour relations;
* the federal government of Canada paying for the above changes using federal tax funds

The province of Quebec already had theoretically full control over education, health, mineral resources, supplemental taxation, social services, seniors&#x27; retirement pension funds, inter-provincial trade, and other areas affecting the daily lives of its citizens. Many Canadians viewed the additional demands as too greatly reducing the power of the federal government, assigning it the role of tax collector and manager of the national border with the United States. Others viewed these changes as desirable, concentrating power in the hands of Québécois politicians, who were more in tune with Québécois desires and interests.

Though the Parti Québécois government said that the federal government of Canada would be responsible for international relations, Quebec proceeded to open its own representative offices in foreign countries around the world. These quasi-embassies were officially named &quot;Quebec Houses&quot;. Today, the international affairs minister is responsible for the less-expensive Quebec delegation system.

== Patriation: Canada Act (1982) ==
Subsequently, an agreement between the federal government and all provincial governments, except that of Quebec, agreed to Canada&#x27;s assumption of full responsibility for its own constitution in 1982 (formerly the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). The agreement was enacted as the Canada Act by the British Parliament, and was proclaimed into law by Queen Elizabeth II on April 17, 1982. In Canada, this was called the patriation of the Constitution.

This action (including the creation of a new &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;) came from an initiative by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau to create a multicultural and bilingual society in all of Canada. Some Canadians saw Trudeau&#x27;s actions as an attempt to &quot;shove French down their throats&quot; (a common phrase at the time). Many Québécois viewed his compromise as a sell-out and useless: Quebec already had a charter enacted in 1975 and was not interested in imposing French on other provinces; rather, it wished to safeguard it inside Quebec. Many Canadians recognize that the province of Quebec is distinct and unique but they do not conclude from this that Quebec merits a position of greater autonomy than the other provinces, which they feel would be the result of granting special powers that are unavailable to the other provinces.

The government of Quebec, in line with its policy of the duality of nations, objected to the new Canadian constitutional arrangement of 1982 (the patriation), because its formula for future constitutional amendments failed to give Quebec veto power over all constitutional changes.

Some believe that the leaders of Quebec used their refusal to agree to the 1982 constitutional amendment as a bargaining tool to gain leverage in future negotiations, because the federal Canadian government desired (though it is not legally necessary) to include all the provinces willingly into the amended constitution. The National Assembly of Quebec rejected the repatriation unanimously. In spite of Quebec&#x27;s lack of assent, the constitution still applies within Quebec and to all Quebec residents. Many in Quebec felt that the other provinces&#x27; adoption of the amendment without Quebec&#x27;s assent was a betrayal of the central tenets of federalism. They referred to the decision as the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;. On the other hand, many federalists believe that Lévesque&#x27;s goal at the constitutional conference was to sabotage it and prevent any agreement from being reached, so that he could hold it up as another failure of federalism. In this school of thought, patriation without Quebec&#x27;s consent was the only option.

=== Constitution Act (1982) ===
== Constitutional reform and upheaval (1982 onwards) ==
Since Canada&#x27;s constitution was patriated without Quebec&#x27;s consent, later initiatives would seek to ameliorate the constitutional &quot;status quo&quot;, with varying results. Two formal, and unsuccessful, attempts were made to reform the constitution. A subsequent sovereignty referendum in 1995 – only narrowly lost – shook Canada to its core, and would bring about the Clarity Act .

=== Meech Lake Accord (1989) ===
In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attempted to address these concerns and bring the province into an amended constitution. Quebec&#x27;s provincial government, then controlled by a party that advocated remaining in Canada on certain conditions (the Parti libéral du Québec), endorsed the accord (called the Meech Lake Accord). Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec referred to it as the &quot;first step&quot; towards gaining new powers from the federal government. The accord failed, however, as the legislature in Manitoba deadlocked after Elijah Harper refused consent to speed up the process enough to pass the Accord, and Clyde Wells refused to grant a vote on the Accord in the Newfoundland House of Assembly.

In 1990, after the Meech Lake Accord had failed, several Quebec representatives of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party and some members of the Liberal Party of Canada formed the Bloc Québécois, a federal political party intent on defending Quebecers&#x27; interests while pursuing independence.

=== Referendum on Charlottetown Accord (1992) ===
The federal government, the twelve provincial and territorial governments, and four first peoples&#x27; groups then negotiated a second proposed constitutional accord in 1992—the Charlottetown Accord. Despite near-unanimous support from the country&#x27;s political leaders, this second effort at constitutional reform was rejected in a nationwide October 1992 referendum. Only 32 per cent of British Columbians supported the accord, because it was seen there and in other western provinces as blocking their hopes for future constitutional changes, such as Senate reform. In Quebec 57 per cent opposed the accord, seeing it as a step backwards compared to the Meech Lake Accord.

In the 1993 federal elections the Bloc Québécois became the official opposition. The following year, the provincial Parti Québécois, also separatist, was elected in Quebec. The two parties&#x27; popularity led to a second referendum on independence, the 1995 Quebec referendum.

=== Referendum on sovereignty (1995) ===
A referendum held in Quebec on October 30, 1995, resulted in a narrow 50.56%-to-49.44% decision against Quebec sovereignty, with a 93% voter turnout.

=== Clarity Act (1998) ===
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien referred the matter over whether a province could unilaterally secede from the federation to the Supreme Court of Canada in December 1999. In its Quebec Secession Reference decision, the Court ruled that the Canadian constitution did not give provinces the power to unilaterally secede. However, it also ruled that, in the event that a clear majority of the population voted in favour of a clear referendum question on secession, the democratic principles of the constitution required political leaders to respond to that result in good faith.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, the federal government introduced legislation known as the Clarity Act which set forth the guidelines for the federal government to recognize any future provincial referendum on secession. The act set out that, after such a referendum was held, the Parliament of Canada would determine whether the question was clear and whether a &quot;clear majority&quot; was attained. The legislation was supported by all members of the House of Commons, except for members of the Bloc Québécois. In response, the Quebec government passed Bill 99, asserting that the Quebec government had the right to submit referendum questions to voters, to determine the referendum question&#x27;s wording, and to accept 50 percent plus one vote as the required winning majority.

<text>Blasius Merrem (4 February 1761 – 23 February 1824) was a German naturalist, zoologist, ornithologist, mathematician, and herpetologist. In 1804, he became the professor of political economy and botany at the University of Marburg.

==Early life==
Merrem was born at Bremen, and studied at the University of Göttingen under Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. He developed an interest in zoology, particularly ornithology.

==Ornithology==
He is remembered chiefly as the first ornithologist to propose a division of birds into Ratitae (ratites or running birds, with a flat sternum) and Carinatae (carinates or flying birds, with a keeled sternum), which formed part of his classification of birds in &quot;Tentamen Systematis Naturalis Avium&quot;, published in Berlin in 1816 (in &quot;Abhandlugen Akad. Wiss. Berlin 1812–1813: Phys. Kl.&quot;).

==Herpetology==
Similarly, in his 1820 opus, &quot;Versuch eines Systems der Amphibien&quot;, he was the first scientist to accurately separate amphibians from reptiles, to separate crocodilians from lizards, and to combine lizards and snakes in a single order.

Merrem is honored in the scientific names of two South American snakes: the subspecies &quot;Erythrolamprus miliaris merremi&quot;, and the species &quot;Xenodon merremii&quot;.

Anglo-Norman landowner Hugh de Lacy built a castle in Tullow at the site of a crossing on the river Slaney. The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell in 1650. There are no extant remains of the castle and the circumstances of its demolition are uncertain. The castle may have been pulled down during the reign of Queen Anne and the stones used in the construction of a barracks in the town.

A monastery and school was founded in the fifth century in Tullow by St Fortchern (or ), a pupil of St Patrick and St Lommán. Although there are no traces of the monastery today, a granite font and cross base at St. Columba&#x27;s Church in Tullow may be associated with it. Tullowphelim holy well is located on Barrack Street in Tullow. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus. It is reputed to be the site of the monastery founded by St Fortiarnán. The current shrine dates to the 1920s. A pattern was held annually on 8 September until about 1800. The Book of Lecan and the Book of Ballymote mention that Saint Darchaorthainn (Derchartainn) and her sister St. Eithne the daughters of Cormac were nuns at Tullow and are believed to be buried in the vicinity. They along with Fortchern and Toranann are regarded as the patron saints of Tullow.

Tullow was also the site of an Augustinian friary. During the dissolution of the monasteries, the land belonging to the friary was granted to James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond. Similarly to Tullow Castle, the friary buildings were demolished but the exact date is uncertain. The Abbey Cemetery is located within the site of the former monastery.

There is a statue of Father John Murphy, one of the leaders of the 1798 Rebellion, who was captured near Tullow and executed in the Market Square on 2 July. There is a small museum with information about this period and other local history located in the former Tullow Methodist church on Bridge Street.

Bishop Daniel Delany founded the Brigidine Sisters in Tullow in 1807.

<text>Taiwania, with the single living species Taiwania cryptomerioides, is a large coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae.

==Etymology==
&quot;Taiwania&quot; means &#x27;from Taiwan&#x27;, while &quot;cryptomerioides&quot; means &#x27;resembling &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was formerly placed in the segregate family Taxodiaceae, it is now included in the monotypic subfamily Taiwanioideae of the family Cupressaceae. It is the second most basal member of the living Cupressaceae, with only &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; being more basal. Its lineage is thought to have diverged from the rest of Cupressaceae during the Middle Jurassic. The oldest fossil assignable to the genus is from the mid-Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) of Alaska. Other fossils of the genus are known from the Late Cretaceous of Asia, the Eocene of Asia and North America, and the Miocene of Europe and Asia.

==Range==
It is native to eastern Asia, growing in the mountains of central Taiwan, and locally in southwest China (Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Tibet) and adjoining Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. It is endangered by illegal logging for its valuable wood in many areas. It is very likely that the range was more extensive in the past before extensive felling for the wood. The populations in mainland Asia were treated as a distinct species &quot;Taiwania flousiana&quot; by some botanists, but the cited differences between these and the Taiwanese population are not consistent when a number of specimens from each area are compared.

==Morphology==
It is one of the largest tree species in Asia, reported to heights of up to tall and with a trunk up to diameter above buttressed base. The leaves are needle-like or awl-like and long on young trees up to about 100 years old, then gradually becoming more scale-like, long, on mature trees. The cones are small, long, with about 15–30 thin, fragile scales, each scale with two seeds.

==History==
The genus is named after the country of Taiwan, from where it first became known to the botanical community in 1910.

The wood is soft, but durable and attractively spicy scented, and was in very high demand in the past, particularly for temple building and coffins. The rarity of the tree and its slow growth in plantations means legal supplies are now very scarce; the species has legal protection in China and Taiwan.

Taiwania is also a journal that is published by National Taiwan University in Taiwan.

==Extraordinary specimens==
In 2022 a team of researchers measured a 79.1 meters (259.5 feet) &quot;Taiwania&quot; specimen in Shei-pa National Park. The tree was growing at an elevation of 2,000m.

In 2023 a specimen was found measuring 84.1 meters in height.

<doc id="991541" wikidata="Q5694126" url="?curid=991541" title="Heather Stefanson">
<text>Heather Dorothy Stefanson (born May 11, 1970) is a Canadian former politician who served as the 24th premier of Manitoba from 2021 to 2023; the first woman in the province&#x27;s history to hold that role.

She is the former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba and served as Leader of the Opposition of Manitoba after the 2023 Manitoba election. She was the member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the electoral district of Tuxedo until May 6, 2024.

==Early life and career==

Stefanson was born on May 11, 1970, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She was raised in Winnipeg, where she attended St. John&#x27;s-Ravenscourt School. She received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Western Ontario.

After receiving her degree, Stefanson worked as a special assistant in the Office of the Prime Minister under Brian Mulroney before returning to Manitoba in 1993 as an assistant to federal Agriculture Minister Charlie Mayer.

From 1995 to 2000, Stefanson was a member of the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Young Associates organization. From 1998 to 2000, Stenson volunteered on Premier Gary Filmon&#x27;s Executive in Tuxedo.

In 1999, Stefanson was suspended for seven months by the Manitoba District Council of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada for failing to meet educational requirements. Stefanson was found to have made 34 inappropriate trades while she was working as an investment adviser at Wellington West Capital. In 2003, Wellington West Capital was fined $13,000 for failing to supervise the activities of Stefanson. She had been suspended from acting in the capacity of a registered representative but had issued statements to clients indicating her employment as a registered representative during this suspension.

==Political career==

Stefanson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a 2000 by-election, replacing former Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon in the south Winnipeg riding of Tuxedo. Stefanson was easily re-elected in the 2003 election, with the NDP improving to a second-place status, followed by her re-election in the 2007, 2011, 2016, and 2019 elections.

In 2002, she received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in recognition of her community service.

In 2016, Premier Brian Pallister named Stefanson deputy premier and the Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In 2018, she became the Minister of Families in addition to her role as deputy premier. In 2021, she took over the health portfolio; health minister Kelvin Goertzen became deputy premier.

On 2 November 2021, Stefanson became the first female Premier of Manitoba following a majority vote of the Progressive Conservative caucus.

=== MLA for Tuxedo ===
Stefanson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a 2000 by-election, replacing former Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon in the south Winnipeg riding of Tuxedo. Stefanson defeated Liberal Rochelle Zimberg by 2692 votes to 1586; Iona Starr, representing the governing New Democratic Party (NDP), finished third.

As MLA for Tuxedo, Stefanson has been an advocate for Special Olympics Manitoba, an organization dedicated to enriching the lives of people with intellectual disabilities through sport. In 2013, she introduced &quot;The Special Olympics Awareness Week Act&quot; in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly, designating the second week of June each year as Special Olympics Awareness Week in Manitoba. The Act received unanimous support from the Manitoba Legislative Assembly. Stefanson also continues to serve as an honorary board member for Special Olympics Manitoba.

Stefanson has announced several investments in the Assiniboine Park located in her Tuxedo constituency. In 2017, when Stefanson was serving as Deputy Premier, she announced $15-million for the Assiniboine Park Conservancy&#x27;s new Diversity Gardens project, the final phase of the Conservancy&#x27;s 10-year, $200 million development plan. As Premier in 2022, Stefanson announced $2 million to support a $15-million capital campaign to build the new Toba Centre for Children &amp; Youth at 710 Assiniboine Park Drive. The Toba Centre provides support to child abuse victims, including forensic interviews.

Stefanson has maintained strong ties with the Jewish community throughout her time as MLA. In 2016, she condemned rising anti-Semitism and praised the Tuxedo Jewish community. In 2019, she joined Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman in requesting that the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg disinvite controversial American activist Linda Sarsour from speaking at an event, citing the speaker&#x27;s alleged anti-Semitic comments.

=== Minister of Justice and Attorney General ===
Stefanson was sworn in as Minister of Justice and Attorney General in a ceremony at the Canadian Museum of Human Rights in 2016, becoming only the second woman to hold that position since 1871. She was also appointed Deputy Premier and Keeper of the Great Seal of the province of Manitoba.

==== Criminal justice system reform ====

In response to a 2016 report by the Macdonald–Laurier Institute that ranked Manitoba&#x27;s criminal justice system as the worst in the country, Stefanson committed to a full review of the criminal justice system. The review showed that Manitoba had the highest adult incarceration rate among provinces, along with high violent crime and recidivism rates. The review also found significant delay in criminal matters moving through Manitoba&#x27;s court system. To respond to the review, Stefanson released Manitoba&#x27;s Criminal Justice System Modernization Strategy in March 2018. The plan included four essential components, including crime prevention; focusing resources on the most serious criminal cases; more effectively using restorative justice; and responsibly reintegrating offenders back into society. In 2019, Stefanson&#x27;s successor as Minister of Justice announced that the strategy had resulted in significant reductions in time to disposition in Manitoba&#x27;s provincial court and Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench as well as a reduction in provincial custody counts.

In 2017, Stefanson collaborated with the Chief Justices of Manitoba&#x27;s provincial court, Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, and Court of Appeal to request that the federal government change the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; to eliminate preliminary inquiries in the province. The letter proposed a four-year pilot project where preliminary inquiries would be eliminated for indictable offences carrying a sentence less than ten years, and replaced with an out-of-court discovery process for offences carrying a sentence over ten years. The goal of the proposed project was to reduce unreasonable court delays. It responded to the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s decision in &quot;R v Jordan&quot;, which set time limits on criminal proceedings that could result in people accused of serious crimes, including murder, walking free due to unreasonable court delay. The federal government responded to calls for preliminary inquiry reform in 2018 with the introduction and passage of Bill C-75. The Bill restricts preliminary inquiries to only offences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years or more. University of Ottawa law professor Allan Rock estimated the legislation would produce an 87 percent reduction in preliminary inquiries and help reduce court delay significantly. In a statement regarding the federal, provincial and territorial Justice Ministers meeting in April 2017, Stefanson expressed her support for mandatory minimum sentences for certain criminal offences. She stated, &quot;anything less than a prison sentence for certain crimes is unjustifiable in Manitoba&#x27;s view.&quot;

In October 2017, Stefanson established a committee of experts in family law to make recommendations on how to make the system more accessible and less adversarial for couples going through separation and divorce. In June 2018, Stefanson announced the committee&#x27;s recommendations, which included establishing a three-year pilot project in Winnipeg to direct Winnipeg-based family matters to non-adversarial mediation outside of court; creating an administrative office to triage and find more appropriate ways to resolve disputes; and expanding information available to Manitobans about family law related issues. In March 2019, Stefanson&#x27;s successor as Minister of Justice introduced The Family Law Modernization Act based on the findings of the committee. The law included changes that would allow separating couples to resolve child custody, support, and property matters without going to court. The provincial government eventually launched a Family Resolution Service to resolve matters earlier and outside the tradition court process.The government estimated the new service would save Manitoba families up to $41 million in court and legal fees.

In March 2018, Stefanson introduced legislation reinstating the Queen&#x27;s Counsel designation for Manitoba lawyers who have served for at least ten years and have demonstrated outstanding practice as a lawyer among other contributions. In October 2018, Stefanson&#x27;s predecessor issued the first call for nominations for Queen&#x27;s Counsel appointments. In June 2019, the Minister of Justice made the first Queen&#x27;s Counsel appointments since the practice ended under the former NDP government in 2001.

==== Cannabis legalization ====
To prepare for the planned federal legalization of cannabis, Stefanson introduced &quot;The Cannabis Harm Prevention Act&quot; in March 2017. The Act created new cannabis-related driving offences that anticipated the eventual legalization of the drug, including granting police the ability to issue 24-hour driver&#x27;s license suspensions if they believe a driver is under the influence of a drug or unable to safely operate a motor vehicle. In response to questions about the 2017 &quot;420&quot; protest on the Manitoba Legislature grounds, Stefanson stressed her concerns about the impact of cannabis on young people, saying of the protest &quot;it does disturb me how many young people were out there today.&quot;

In December 2017, Stefanson introduced &quot;The Safe and Responsible Retailing of Cannabis Act&quot;, which established the framework for the regulation of cannabis retail sales in Manitoba. The Act established a private retail model, with retail licenses obtained from the newly renamed Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Authority. It required that all retailers source their cannabis supply from Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries. The Act also established 19 as the legal age to purchase cannabis in Manitoba, a decision endorsed by the Manitoba School Boards Association, as it would help keep cannabis out of schools and playgrounds.

Despite federal legislation allowing Canadian adults to grow up to four cannabis plants at home, the &quot;Safe and Responsible Retailing of Cannabis Act&quot; prohibited individuals from home cultivation of cannabis. Manitoba and Quebec are the only provinces to prohibit home cultivation of cannabis. Stefanson defended the home grow prohibition as a means of keeping cannabis away from children and preventing diversion of supply into the black market. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police had joined Stefanson and other Justice Ministers in calling for a national prohibition of home cultivation in April 2017. Cannabis advocates have since challenged both the Manitoba and Quebec home cultivation prohibitions in court as unconstitutional.

In March 2018, Stefanson announced &quot;The Impaired Driving Offences Act&quot;, which updated drug impaired driving provisions to complement pending federal legislation. Included in the Act were new administrative driver&#x27;s license suspensions for impaired driving. She was joined by the Minister of Health, Seniors and Active Living who announced a provincial prohibition on smoking cannabis in outdoor public places.

==== Family law reform ====

In October 2017, Stefanson established a committee of experts in family law to make recommendations on how to make the system more accessible and less adversarial for couples going through separation and divorce. In June 2018, Stefanson announced the committee&#x27;s recommendations, which included establishing a three-year pilot project in Winnipeg to direct Winnipeg-based family matters to non-adversarial mediation outside of court; creating an administrative office to triage and find more appropriate ways to resolve disputes; and expanding information available to Manitobans about family law related issues.

In March 2019, Stefanson&#x27;s successor as Minister of Justice introduced The Family Law Modernization Act based on the findings of the committee. The law included changes that would allow separating couples to resolve child custody, support, and property matters without going to court. The provincial government eventually launched a Family Resolution Service to resolve matters earlier and outside the traditional court process. The government estimated the new service would save Manitoba families up to $41 million in court and legal fees.

==== Queen&#x27;s Counsel Act ====

In March 2018, Stefanson introduced legislation reinstating the Queen&#x27;s Counsel designation for Manitoba lawyers who have served for at least 10 years and have demonstrated outstanding practice as a lawyer among other contributions. In October 2018, Stefanson&#x27;s predecessor issued the first call for nominations for Queen&#x27;s Counsel appointments. In June 2019, the Minister of Justice made the first Queen&#x27;s Counsel appointments since the practice ended under the former NDP government in 2001. 

=== Minister of Families ===
Stefanson was sworn in as Minister of Families in a ceremony at the Manitoba Legislature on August 1, 2018. She also retained her position as Deputy Premier.

==== Child and family services ====

In September 2018, Stefanson reported the first reduction in the number of children in Child and Family Services (CFS) care in 15 years, with a nine percent decrease in child apprehensions and an eight percent increase in family reunifications. Stefanson credited the government&#x27;s emphasis on preventative measures as helping at-risk families avoid contact with the child welfare system. The number of children in CFS care decreased each year Stefanson was Minister of Families.

Stefanson made several changes to Manitoba&#x27;s CFS system meant to reduce the number of children in care. In February 2019, she announced a new block funding or &quot;single envelope&quot; funding model for CFS authorities, which are responsible for child welfare agencies in various regions of the province. The new model ended the per-child funding model where CFS agencies would receive funding based on the number of children in care and the number of days they are in care, which the government said incentivized child apprehensions.

In January 2020, Stefanson announced that the province would end the controversial practice of birth alerts, where CFS agencies warn hospitals about the history of a pregnant mother considered &quot;high risk.&quot; Indigenous leadership had called for an end to the practice. Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Grand Chief Garrison Settee expressed excitement at the news, telling media &quot;we applaud the province for listening to us.&quot; In June 2020, Stefanson announced the official end of birth alerts along with an investment of $400,000 to double the capacity of the Mothering Project, a program to support vulnerable mothers and their children operated by Mount Carmel Clinic. Stefanson had previously invested $400,000 to launch Granny&#x27;s House, a two-story home in North Point Douglas that provides short-term respite for parents otherwise at-risk of CFS contact.

==== Housing ====

In June 2019, Stefanson signed onto the National Housing Strategy with the federal government. The 10-year agreement with the federal government promised to invest almost $450.8 million to expand and repair social and community housing in the province. The strategy was cost shared by both levels of government, with Manitoba contributing $225.4 million to the agreement.

In January 2020, Stefanson released &quot;Shared Priorities – Sustainable Progress: A 12-Month Action Plan for Manitoba Families&quot;. The action plan included a commitment to increase private and community-based delivery of social housing while repairing existing housing stock. Housing advocates criticized the plan as a cost cutting measure. In July 2020, Stefanson announced a $31 million investment in repairs to Manitoba Housing properties, estimated to make over 800 otherwise vacant units ready for new tenants.

Stefanson announced several home ownership programs throughout her time as Minister of Families. In August 2020, she announced a $3 million for Habitat for Humanity to support its home building program over three years. She later announced $2 million to provide down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers and help build houses for First Nations families through a partnership between the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Manitoba Real Estate Association.

==== COVID-19 pandemic response ====

Stefanson was Minister of Families during most of the first year of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic required significant changes to the delivery of social services provided by her department, including childcare, CFS, homelessness, and disability services.

The Manitoba government announced the closure of childcare centres on March 17, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two days later, Stefanson announced $27.6 million in support to help childcare centres serve the children of frontline workers, including an $18 million grant program administered by the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce and Manitoba Chambers of Commerce to help early childhood educators offer childcare services at home or in the community. In August 2020, Stefanson announced the government would repurpose some of the funds as part of a $22 million investment intended to expand choices in childcare.

For children in the Manitoba CFS system, Stefanson extended supports and services to all young adults who would otherwise age out of the system during the pandemic. Stefanson also announced a partnership with telecommunications firm TELUS to support children in CFS, with the donating 120 tablets with data plans to the province. Emergency placement shelters operated by Winnipeg Child and Family Services received the majority of the tablets, helping children reconnect with family, friends, teachers, and other supports.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19 among Manitoba&#x27;s homelessness population, Stefanson announced $1.2 million to add 140 shelter beds by repurposing a vacant Manitoba Housing building and expanding capacity at the Salvation Army and Siloam Mission shelters. She extended funding for homeless shelters again in June and September, including by expanding available space at the Main Street Project shelter in Winnipeg.

To help low-income Manitobans with disabilities, Stefanson joined Premier Brian Pallister to announce $4.6 million for the Disability Economic Support Program. The program provided a $200 one-time cheque to 23,000 Manitobans receiving Employment and Income Assistance benefits under the disability category. Stefanson also announced measures to improve staffing in disability services agencies, including $6 million to help with overtime costs, replacement staff, and sick leave as part of a broader $10 million Pandemic Staffing Support Benefit. She later announced a one-time $5 wage top up for workers in the disability services and other critical frontline positions as part of the $35 million Caregiver Wage Support Program. Stefanson also announced a partnership with Manitoba Possible and Red River College to increase staffing in disability services agencies during the pandemic.

In June 2020, Stefanson announced $2.5 million for a Home Nutrition and Learning Program pilot project. The province worked with community organizations to 2,500 families with packages of healthy foods, including recipes and learning activities developed by the Child Nutrition Council of Manitoba.

=== Minister of Health and Seniors Care ===
Stefanson was sworn in as Minister of Health and Seniors Care in a ceremony at the Manitoba Legislature on January 5, 2021. She did not retain the Deputy Premier role, which the premier awarded to Kelvin Goertzen, the Minister of Legislative and Public Affairs. Stefanson identified the COVID-19 vaccine rollout as a significant priority in interviews following her appointment as Minister of Health and Seniors Care.

==== Dr. Lynn Stevenson Long-Term Care Review ====

In February 2021, Stefanson announced that the Manitoba government would implement all recommendations of Dr. Lynn Stevenson&#x27;s review of long-term care. The review examined the COVID-19 outbreak at the Maples Long Term Care facility that resulted in 56 deaths. As Premier, Stefanson later announced $15 million to implement the Stevenson review recommendations, which included enhancing infection prevention and control, hiring 200 full-time housekeeping staff, and improving information technology to better support patient care.

==== Budget 2021 investments ====

In April 2021, Stefanson joined Minister of Finance Scott Fielding to announce $1.2 billion for the COVID-19 pandemic response. The funding included $350 million for additional health system costs to prepare for a third wave of COVID-19 and $100 million for a vaccine program across the province. Moreover, $300 million was set aside as COVID-19 contingency for unbudgeted expenses. The budget also included $50 million to address the backlog in surgeries and diagnostic tests that had accumulated during the pandemic.

Budget 2021 included $6.98 billion for health care, an increase of $156 million from the previous year. New health care investments included $23 million for cancer treatments, $2.7 million to expand dialysis treatment, and $9.3 million to expand personal care homes in the municipalities of Steinbach and Carman.

==== COVID-19 third wave ====

During Manitoba&#x27;s third-wave of COVID-19, Stefanson claimed on May 18, 2021, that Manitoba&#x27;s health system could handle an additional 50 patients in the ICU for a total of 170. However, later that day, she announced ICU beds were at capacity and two patients had been sent to Thunder Bay for treatment. Shared Health had been aware that the healthcare system was unable to handle 170 patients, and on May 7, chief nursing officer Lanette Siragusa called a previous exercise showing capacity at 173 ICU beds a &quot;paper exercise&quot; that &quot;did not reflect the reality of Manitoba&#x27;s capacity.&quot;

On May 13, Shared Health CEO Adam Topp attended a meeting regarding Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre and ICU capacity. However, Stefanson claims she was not aware of this meeting, and didn&#x27;t know about the out-of-province transfer until after the decision was made. In total, Manitoba transferred 57 COVID-19 patients out of the province during the third wave, 12 of whom died while being treated out of province.

One of the individuals who died was 31-year-old Krystal Mousseau, a mother of two from Ebb and Flow First Nation in Manitoba. Her death prompted criticism from Wab Kinew, the Leader of the Opposition, who questioned whether Mousseau had been appropriately cleared for medical transport. Dr. John Younes, Manitoba&#x27;s Chief Medical Examiner, declined to call an inquest into the death. On March 1, 2021, Younes wrote to Kinew stating that a &quot;carefully considered medical decision was made to move patients out of province to make room for incoming patients who would otherwise not survive.&quot; He added that it is not the role of an inquest to &quot;second guess complex medical decisions, particularly those made under horrific circumstances.&quot; Kinew later requested that the Premier to call an inquiry into the death.

==== Vaccine rollout ====

In January 2021, Stefanson announced a four-stage immunization plan that outlined a strategy to expand Manitoba&#x27;s immunization campaign to priority groups and then to all Manitobans based on age. The plan was based on guidelines developed by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization and was informed by 27 physicians on Manitoba&#x27;s vaccine medical advisory table. Stefanson was criticized for a slow rollout of the vaccine, which she attributed to a lack of supply from the federal government. On May 5, 2021, Stefanson announced that the province had administered 500,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Ten days later, she reported that 50 percent of all Manitoba adults had received at least one dose of the vaccine.

The #ProtectMB COVID-19 Immunization Plan included setting up vaccine clinics in several areas, including supersites, focussed immunization teams, and pop-up community clinics. By April 2022, 1.1 million Manitobans were fully vaccinated representing 82 per cent of those eligible.

==== Medical leave ====

On May 21, 2021, the province announced Stefanson would be taking a medical leave to undergo a necessary procedure recommended by her physician. Kelvin Goertzen acted as interim Health Minister in her absence. Stefanson resumed her duties virtually in late June and gave her first in-person interview with media on July 8, 2021. She did not provide details as to the nature of her medical procedure. She later told media she had undergone a hysterectomy on the recommendation of her doctor after putting it off for more than a year.

== 2021 Manitoba Progressive Conservative leadership ==
After Pallister announced his impending retirement, Stefanson announced that she would run in the 2021 Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba leadership election. She was the first PC party member to announce their candidacy in the election, and had the support of two thirds of the PC caucus. Stefanson ran prominently on a pledge to scrap Bill 64, Pallister&#x27;s unpopular education reform legislation.

Pallister resigned on September 1, and Kelvin Goertzen took over as premier pending the election of his successor. Stefanson garnered strong support from Manitoba&#x27;s business community. On September 24, 2021, her campaign published an endorsement letter signed by seven prominent businesspeople who expressed concerns about the anti-vaccine sentiments of her opponent, Shelly Glover.

Stefanson narrowly won the race with 363 votes over her opponent. On March 21, Stefanson released her leadership campaign financials revealing that she raised $576,625 in campaign donations, $360,000 of that money came from 120 individuals who donated the maximum amount of $3,000. Stefanson received donations from several prominent businesspeople, including Winnipeg Jets executive chairman Mark Chipman, Richardson Financial Group CEO Sandy Riley, and Buhler Industries founder John Buhler.

On May 14, 2022, Stefanson was cautioned for having illegally spent $1,800 in campaign funds prior to the electoral period beginning.

== Premier of Manitoba ==
Stefanson was sworn in as Manitoba&#x27;s first female premier on November 2, 2021. Her swearing-in speech outlined her top priorities as advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, addressing surgical and diagnostic backlogs, rebuilding the economy, improving education, and focusing on labour shortages in the economy. She also promised to create a task force to tackle the backlog in surgeries and diagnostic tests.

Stefanson is credited with dramatically improving relationships with other levels of government, which federal officials and Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman have remarked to media. This comes as Stefanson has continued to work with other First Minister&#x27;s to pressure the federal government to restore its share of the Canada Health Transfer.

=== 2021 Throne Speech and cabinet shuffle ===

Following Stefanson&#x27;s swearing in as Premier, she announced her intention to begin a new legislative session with a Speech from the Throne on November 23, 2021. She also announced a new senior leadership team, including a new Chief of Staff.

Lieutenant-Governor Janice Filmon read the Speech from the Throne, which was branded as Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;Path to Progressing Together.&quot; The Speech outlined Stefanson&#x27;s vision for a &quot;strong economic and social recovery, with a focus on the health and wellbeing of all Manitobans.&quot; Loren Remillard, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, praised the speech and said that it demonstrated that Stefanson&#x27;s priorities were aligned with those of the business community. Remillard praised Stefanson again when she delivered the annual State of the Province address just over a week later.

Stefanson shuffled her cabinet on January 18, 2022. The shuffle added three new MLAs to prominent cabinet positions. It also split the health care portfolio into three positions – the Minister of Health, the Minister of Mental Health and Community Wellness, and the Minister of Seniors and Long-term Care. She also appointed a Minister of Labour, a move endorsed by the Manitoba Federation of Labour as &quot;long past due.&quot; University of Manitoba political studies professor Royce Koop praised the shuffle as sound political strategy.

Stefanson established a new Economic Development Board of Cabinet on February 22, 2022, to co-ordinate economic growth and job creation initiatives in Manitoba.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

Stefanson acted in response to the COVID-19 Omicron variant, only after annual Christmas celebrations. Stefanson announced public health orders to combat the Omicron variant on December 27, 2021. On January 12, 2022, Stefanson responded to questions about making public health orders more stringent by saying that &quot;we must all learn to live with this virus; there must be a balance.&quot;

On February 2, 2022, she announced the first phase in a plan to loosen public health restrictions and later announced a date when all public health orders would end in Manitoba. Manitoba ended all public health orders on March 15, 2022.

Stefanson required her cabinet and caucus to be vaccinated against COVID-19, imposing a deadline for them to meet immunization requirements. She later removed Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler from cabinet due his refusal to disclose his vaccination status, a decision she characterized as inconsistent with the government&#x27;s efforts to promote vaccination. Stefanson later removed Tory MLA Josh Guenter from his role as Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Health for his continued disagreement with the government over COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Stefanson&#x27;s Minister of Health announced the establishment of a Diagnostic and Surgical Recovery Task Force on December 8, 2021, to address the backlogs created by the COVID-19 pandemic response.

=== 2022 budget ===

Stefanson&#x27;s Minister of Finance tabled the 2022 Manitoba Budget on April 12, 2022. The Budget, which was branded Recover Together, focused on five priorities – strengthening health care, making life more affordable, building the economy, investing in communities, and protecting the environment.

The 2022 Budget increased the Education Property Tax Rebate to 37.5 per cent. The tax cut was projected to save Manitobans $350 million in 2022. The Budget also promised to increase the rebate again in 2023, saving the average homeowner $1,355 over two years. The 2022 Budget Speech stated that cumulative tax changes since the Progressive Conservatives formed government in 2016 put $2,400 &quot;back in the pockets&quot; of the average Manitoban.

The 2022 Budget included $50 million for a new Venture Capital Fund to assist Manitoba companies with start-up costs. The measure was praised by prominent members of the province&#x27;s business community, including representatives from the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce and the Business Council of Manitoba.

The 2022 Budget included $110 million for the Diagnostic and Surgical Recovery Task Force and $32 million to improve long-term care for seniors. The overall health care budget was $7.2 billion, the largest health care investment in the province&#x27;s history at the time.

=== Affordability measures ===

On August 31, 2022, Stefanson announced a Family Affordability Package that included $87 million in measures to offset the rising cost of living for Manitobans. The package included an announcement that Manitoba families with children and a household income of less than $175,000 would receive a benefit cheque of $250 for their first child and $200 for each subsequent child, helping an estimated 145,000 families. Moreover, low-income seniors with less than $40,000 in family income who claimed an Education Property Tax Credit in 2021 would receive a $300 cheque to help with rising costs.

As part of the Family Affordability Package, Stefanson also announced the first increase in the basic needs rate for Employment and Income Assistance clients in 20 years, providing EIA general assistance clients without dependent children an extra $50 per month. The announcement was praised by the CEO of Manitoba Harvest, a large food bank in the province.

=== Criticism ===

Over her premiership, polling data has consistently suggested Stefanson to be the most unpopular premier in Canada.

On January 27, 2022, Stefanson admitted to breaking conflict of interest rules when she failed to disclose over $31 million in property sales. As an MLA, Stefanson had listed these properties among her assets, but then stopped when the properties sold and she did not file the required paperwork, but had met with the conflict of interest commissioner.

On March 15, Stefanson received widespread criticism for responding to a question from Wab Kinew, the Leader of the Opposition, about Krystal Mousseau, an ICU patient who died during a failed transfer to a hospital out of Manitoba, for responding by talking about her son&#x27;s performance at a hockey game. Two days later, Stefanson issued a brief written apology. Kinew has been calling for an inquiry into circumstances of the death citing a letter from the regional health authority released a letter explaining that the transfer team was lacking critical monitoring equipment and training. Additionally, the patient was being given medication at the wrong rate. Dr. John Younes, Manitoba&#x27;s Chief Medical Examiner, declined to call an inquest into the death. On March 1, 2021, Younes wrote to Kinew stating that a &quot;carefully considered medical decision was made to move patients out of province to make room for incoming patients who would otherwise not survive.&quot; He added that it is not the role of an inquest to &quot;second guess complex medical decisions, particularly those made under horrific circumstances.&quot; Kinew was later criticized for exploiting Mousseau&#x27;s death for political gain.

On June 9, 2022, Pride Winnipeg criticized Stefanson for using Pride as a photo-op when she did not march in the parade despite having promised to do so. When questioned, Stefanson blamed this on &quot;scheduling conflicts&quot; and miscommunication from her staff. The previous Premier, Brian Pallister, similarly broke his promise to march in the parade after giving a speech; as a result, Pride Winnipeg implemented a policy that invited speakers must also march in the parade. Pride Winnipeg subsequently stated that they would not be extending an invitation to Stefanson to speak at any 2023 Pride events. Stefanson ultimately announced annual grants of $250,000 for Winnipeg Pride, and would take part in the 2023 event by walking in the parade.

On Tuesday, October 18, 2022, concerns were raised when it was discovered that Stefanson had used an undisclosed secret email for government communication. In a freedom of information request, it was revealed that on February 11, Stefanson privately pleaded for help from the federal government amidst border blockades, asking for &quot;immediate and effective&quot; action and &quot;national leadership that only you and the federal government can provide.&quot; A few days later, Stefanson would publicly claim that the situation was under control, and called on the government to refrain from using the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;.

In February 2023, Stefanson ended an online school that was launched in January 2021 to provide a remote learning option for grades K-8 during the height of the pandemic, the only K-8 remote learning option at the time. The Manitoba Remote Learning Support Center was ended as the provincial government stated that it was never intended to be a permanent fixture. Despite several phone calls and emails of concern over the closure, enrolment in the remote learning centre was shown to have decreased by 85% since its launch in 2021—serving a student population of 1,050 in the 2020/21 school year, to near 200 by 2023.

=== Defeat ===
Stefanson led the PCs into the 2023 Manitoba general election. During the previous legislature, the rival opposition Manitoba NDP had gained a polling lead over the PCs. However, the lead had tightened during the campaign period. She primarily campaigned on reducing the cost of living for Manitoba families and businesses. At the election, the PCs were heavily defeated by the NDP. Following her party&#x27;s defeat, Stefanson announced she would step down as the leader of the Progressive Conservatives. She narrowly held on to her own seat, and was one of only three PCs left in the capital. In April 2024, she announced that she would resign from her seat and retire from politics, triggering the 2024 Tuxedo by-election, which was won by the NDP, the first time the PC did not win the constituency since its creation in 1981.

<doc id="991544" wikidata="Q485566" url="?curid=991544" title="National Intelligence Service (South Korea)">
<text>The National Intelligence Service (NIS; ) is the chief intelligence agency of South Korea. The agency was officially established in 1961 as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA; ), during the rule of general Park Chung Hee’s military Supreme Council for National Reconstruction, which displaced the Second Republic of Korea. The original duties of the KCIA were to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the military. The agency’s broad powers allowed it to actively intervene in politics. Agents undergo years of training and checks before they are officially inducted and receive their first assignments.

The agency took on the name Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP; ) in 1981, as part of a series of reforms instituted by the Fifth Republic of Korea under President Chun Doo-hwan. Besides trying to acquire intelligence on North Korea and suppress South Korean activists, the ANSP, like its predecessor, was heavily involved in activities outside its sphere, including domestic politics and promoting the 1988 Summer Olympics. During its existence, the ANSP engaged in numerous cases of human rights abuse such as torture, as well as election tampering.

In 1999, the agency assumed its current name. The more democratic and current Sixth Republic of Korea has seen a significant reduction in the role of the NIS in response to public criticisms about past abuses.

==History==

===Korean Central Intelligence Agency===
The agency’s origins can be traced back to the Korean Counterintelligence Corps (KCIC), formed during the Korean War. The KCIA was founded on 13 June 1961 by Kim Jong-pil, who drew much of the organization&#x27;s initial 3,000-strong membership from the KCIC. Kim, a Korean Military Academy graduate and nephew of Park Chung Hee by marriage, is also credited with masterminding the 1961 coup d’État that installed Park before he was elected president of Korea.
President Park’s government extensively used the intelligence service to suppress and disrupt anti-government or pro–North Korean or other pro-communist movements, including the widespread student protests on university campuses and the activities of overseas Koreans. The KCIA developed a reputation for interfering in domestic politics and international affairs beyond its jurisdiction. The KCIA’s original charter, the Act Concerning Protection of Military Secrets, was designed to oversee the coordination of activities related to counterespionage and national security, but a majority of its activities and budget were devoted to things unrelated to its original charter.

In 1968, KCIA agents kidnapped 17 Koreans living in West Germany. They were transported back to Seoul, where they were tortured and brought up on charges of having violated the National Security Law by engaging in pro-Northern activities. The victims became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; as the kidnapping created a firestorm of international criticism that almost brought the West German government to break off diplomatic relations with South Korea. It further served as a harbinger when the much-publicised kidnapping of a dissident, Kim Dae-jung—who would later become the president of Korea and the country’s first Nobel Peace Prize recipient, in 2000—took place in 1973 off the coast of a Japanese resort town.

The KCIA&#x27;s virtually unlimited and completely unchecked power to arrest and detain any person on any charge created a climate of extreme fear and repression. The frequent detention and torture of students, dissidents, opposition figures, communists, reporters, or anyone perceived to be critical of the government was symptomatic of the Park presidency and the subsequent administration. In another departure from its original charter, the KCIA&#x27;s assumptive role as political machine extraordinaire and domination of the country&#x27;s political life began to take on even more bizarre forms such as exercising a free hand in drafting the South Korean constitution and acting as a political fundraiser for the incumbent party.

In addition to its presumptive intelligence and secret police role, which was ostensibly authorized by its original charter, it also became, by default, through a network of agents at home and abroad, the &quot;de facto&quot; attorney general and inspector general of the South Korean government. Domestically, the KCIA made itself the philanthropical arm of the government by being an avid supporter of the arts, promoter of tourism, and purveyor of national culture.

The KCIA is known to have raised funds through extortion and stock market manipulation, which were in turn used to bribe and cajole companies, individuals and even foreign governments, as happened during the Koreagate scandal in the United States in 1976. Investigations by United States Congressman Donald M. Fraser found the KCIA to have funneled bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence in Washington, D.C.; some 115 Members of Congress were implicated in the affair.

===Agency for National Security Planning===
In 1979, the agency&#x27;s director, Kim Jae-kyu, assassinated President Park Chung Hee during a dinner. In the aftermath, the KCIA was purged, with Kim and five others being executed, and temporarily lost much of its power.

The new director, Chun Doo-hwan, used his tenure from April to July 1980 to expand his power base beyond the military, and the organization was renamed the Agency for National Security Planning in 1981, with its powers redefined in presidential orders and legislation.

The ANSP, like its predecessor, was a cabinet-level agency directly accountable to the president, and the director of the ANSP continued to have direct presidential access.

In March 1981, the ANSP was redesignated as the principal agency for collecting and processing all intelligence. The requirement for all other agencies with intelligence-gathering and analysis functions in their charters to coordinate their activities with the ANSP was reaffirmed.

Legislation passed at the end of 1981 further redefined the ANSP&#x27;s legally mandated functions to include the collection, compilation, and distribution of foreign and domestic information regarding public safety against communists and plots to overthrow the government.

The maintenance of public safety with regard to documents, materials, facilities, and districts designated as secrets of the state was the purview of the ANSP, as was the investigation of crimes of insurrection and foreign aggression, crimes of rebellion, aiding and abetting the enemy, disclosure of military secrets, and crimes provided for in the Act Concerning Protection of Military Secrets and the National Security Act. The investigation of crimes related to duties of intelligence personnel, the supervision of information collection, and the compilation and distribution of information on other agencies&#x27; activities designed to maintain public safety also were undertaken by the ANSP.

By 1983 the ANSP had rebounded and again was the preeminent foreign and domestic intelligence organization.

Nevertheless, the ANSP&#x27;s domestic powers were indeed curtailed under the Sixth Republic. Prior to the change, the ANSP had free access to all government offices and files. The ANSP, Defense Security Command, Office of the Prosecutor General, Korean National Police, and the Ministry of Justice had stationed their agents in the National Assembly of Korea to collect information on the activities of politicians.

In May 1988, however, overt ANSP agents, along with agents of other intelligence agencies, were withdrawn from the National Assembly building.

The ANSP&#x27;s budget was not made public, nor apparently was it made available in any useful manner to the National Assembly in closed sessions. In July 1989, pressured by opposition parties and public opinion, the ANSP was subjected to inspection and audit by the National Assembly for the first time in eighteen years, with the ANSP removing its agents from the chambers of the Seoul Criminal Court and the Supreme Court.

In another move to limit the potential for the ANSP to engage in &quot;intelligence politics,&quot; the ANSP Information Coordination Committee was disbanded because of its history of unduly influencing other investigating authorities, such as the Office of the Prosecutor General. Additionally, the ANSP, responding to widespread criticism of its alleged human rights violations, set up a &quot;&quot; office to supervise its domestic investigations and to prevent agents from abusing their powers while interrogating suspects.

The ANSP remained deeply involved in domestic politics, however, and was not fully prepared to relinquish its power. In April 1990, for example, ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) co-leader Kim Young-sam complained that he and members of his faction within the DLP had been subjected to &quot;intelligence maneuvering in politics&quot; that included wiretapping, surveillance, and financial investigations.

Despite an agreement in September 1989 by the chief policymakers of the ruling and opposition parties to strip the ANSP of its power to investigate pro–North Korean activity (a crime under the National Security Act), the ANSP continued enforcing this aspect of the law rather than limiting itself to countering internal and external attempts to overthrow the government. The ANSP continued to pick up radical students and dissident leaders for questioning without explanation.

Aside from its controversial internal security mission, the ANSP also was known for its foreign intelligence gathering and analysis and for its investigation of offenses involving external subversion and military secrets. The National Unification Board and the ANSP (and the KCIA before it) were the primary sources of government analysis and policy direction for South Korea&#x27;s reunification strategy and contacts with North Korea. The intelligence service&#x27;s pursuit of counterespionage cases was also held in high regard.

===Contemporary history===
In 1994, the ANSP had a significant revision of its charter, which effectively limited its activities, following an agreement between Korea&#x27;s ruling and opposition parties. As a result, an &quot;Information Committee&quot; in the National Assembly was established to lay a foundation for the agency&#x27;s removal from the political scene and an assumption of political neutrality. The ANSP also began to develop procedures and mechanisms to thwart international crime and terrorism. In 1995, the ANSP moved to a new headquarters site in Naegok-dong, southern Seoul, from its previous location on Namsan mountain, in Imun-dong, where it had been located for the past 34 years.

Most specifics regarding the agency&#x27;s organizational makeup remain classified by the Seoul government. A 1998 investigation by the &quot;Sisa Journal&quot; into the structure of the agency (then the ANSP) estimated that it employed some 60,000 employees across 39 headquarters and regionally-based departments, spending an estimated 700–800 billion South Korean won per year.

In the presidential election held in December 2012, NIS committed a serious crime by secretly helping Park Geun-hye&#x27;s campaign, according to the Korean police investigation report. Korean prosecutors investigated the incident. in February 2015, Won was convicted on charges of instructing NIS officials to manipulate internet comments and was sentenced to three years in prison. After an appeal, the conviction was overturned. In a second trial in 2017, Won was sentenced to four years in prison. The Supreme Court upheld the sentence in April 2018. When Moon Jae-in won the 2017 election, his administration pursued nine additional charges of political interference against Won, resulting in a subsequent 7 year jail sentence in 2020.
In August of 2017, the NIS formally acknowledged that it was involved in the election manipulation after an internal inquiry.

In 2015, Hacking Team&#x27;s breached data showed that NIS purchased spyware from Hacking Team. An agent related to the hack was found dead in an apparent suicide. In his note, he said that the agency didn&#x27;t spy on civilians or on political reactions related to 2012&#x27;s presidential election.

====National Intelligence Service====
In 1999, it was officially renamed the National Intelligence Service.

According to its official publications, the NIS is divided into three directorates: &quot;International affairs&quot;, &quot;Domestic affairs&quot;, and &quot;North Korean affairs&quot;. Its current officially stated mission assigns the NIS responsibility for the:

* &quot;Collection, coordination, and distribution of information on the nation&#x27;s strategy and security.&quot;
* &quot;Maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation&#x27;s classified information.&quot;
* &quot;Investigation of crimes affecting national security, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law.&quot;
* &quot;Investigation of crimes related to the missions of NIS staff.&quot;
* &quot;Planning and coordination of information and classified.&quot;
The election of Roh Moo-hyun to the South Korean presidency in 2003 brought more concerted efforts to reform the agency. Roh appointed Ko Young-koo, a former human rights lawyer, to the position of director, expressing a desire to find &quot;someone who will set the agency straight&quot;. The anti-communist bureau of the agency was slated to be eliminated, and many domestic intelligence and surveillance activities were either abandoned or transferred to national police forces.

In December 2008, it was alleged by the official media arm of North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency, that a NIS-trained North Korean citizen had been apprehended as part of a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader. Both the NIS and the South Korean government denied any involvement.

The NIS officially admitted in 2011 that it wiretapped Gmail accounts of South Korean citizens in the South Korean Constitutional Court.

The 2012 budget for the NIS could potentially get cut as it had shown its inefficiencies.
In 2016, a prosecutors&#x27; investigation turned up evidence that the NIS has been effectively orchestrating the activities of conservative groups since the administration of former president Lee Myung-bak (2008–2013). The evidence shows that the NIS has been involved not only in political advertisements that conservative groups have run in newspapers but also in their plans to hold one-person protests and to hand out pamphlets: &quot;An agent surnamed Park who was on the NIS&#x27;s psychological warfare team supported and supervised right-wing conservative organizations and right-wing youth organizations.&quot;

On 13 December 2020, the National Security Law was amended. This law, adopted in 1948, was designed to protect the country from North Korean threats. It stated that South Korean citizens could not praise, sympathise, correspond or aid North Koreans. However, this law has been said to have allowed the NIS to violate some important human rights, such as the forcing of confessions, as well as conducting &quot;anti-communist&quot; investigations. This law allowed authorities to imprison someone for up to seven years for simply possessing a book relating to North Korean ideologies. The law also extended to punishing &quot;anti-governmental organizations&quot;, allowing the NIS to punish civilians who spoke out against or had differing ideals to the government, breaching their right to the freedom of speech. Due to the continuous threat from North Korea, there are concerns that amending this law would further exacerbate this issue.

Despite this amendment, there are still major concerns that the NIS will continue to breach human rights. Even though the amendment forbids the NIS from conducting criminal investigations, it still allows the collection of information on anyone violating the National Security Law. This new amendment will prohibit the involvement of the NIS in domestic politics following their attempt to influence the 2012 elections with a slanderous campaign against candidate Moon Jae-in. Effective from 1 January 2024, the amendment will now transfer the power to investigate domestic concerns to the national police service.

In June 2018, three former NIS directors (Lee Byung-kee, Lee Byung-ho, and Nam Jae-joon) who served in the Park administration were found guilty of bribery, related to the 2016 Park Geun-hye scandals. They illegally transferred money from the NIS budget to Park&#x27;s presidential office without any approval or oversight from the National Assembly. This illegally obtained money was used by Park and her associates for private use and to pay bribes.

On 14 December 2020, the National Assembly passed a bill that transferred investigation authority of the NIS into North Korean activities in South Korea to the Korean National Police Agency.

On 2 February 2024, the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Defense Counterintelligence Command (DCC) are investigating whether Indonesian engineers dispatched to KAI violated the Defense Technology Security Act for allegedly attempting to leak KF-21 jet fighter technical data outside after storing it on an unauthorized USB drive.

=== Scandals ===

==== Kim Dae-jung Government ====
In 2000, $500,000,000 ($100,000,000 of government money, and $400,000,000 from Hyundai) was used to secure the Inter-Korean Summit. This was perceived by the general public as a bribe and a method of buying the summit, consequently leading to a public scandal in 2003. It was also rumoured that this large sum of money was the reason that Kim was awarded the 2002 Global Peace Prize for his &#x27;Sunshine Policy&#x27; of that year. The scandal ultimately led to the arrest of former National Intelligence Service director Lim Dong-won, under the accusation of &#x27;violating laws on foreign exchange transactions&#x27;. In May 2006, the current National Intelligence Service director, Park Jie-won, was also sentenced to three years imprisonment for his participation in the scandal, but was released in February 2007 and pardoned in December of that year.

In 2003, the scandal surrounding public eavesdropping and the illegal interception of phone calls took place under Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s government. The act was later admitted to being true and to have taken place until March 2002, shortly before the end of Kim&#x27;s term. The National Intelligence Service claimed that Kim Dae-jung was not informed of the illegal activities taking place.

==== Park Geun-hye government ====
In 2012, Park Geun-hye&#x27;s presidential election was revealed to have been manipulated by members of the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in order to ensure that a conservative candidate came into power. Agents were accused of manipulating public opinions surrounding the election through means such as social media, as ordered by the NIS. This led to former spy chief Won Sei-hoon&#x27;s three-year imprisonment in 2015 in connection to the case. Park Geun-hye was later charged on 31 March 2017, and again on 17 April of that year for the abuse of power, bribery, coercion, and leaking of government secrets. Similar manipulations were revealed to have taken place in 2011 and earlier in 2012, with surveillance being placed on other opposing politicians.

Following the 2016 South Korean political scandal and corruption surrounding Park Geun-hye&#x27;s presidential role, two former NIS chiefs were arrested in November 2017. Nam Jae-joon and Lee Byung-kee were arrested for embezzlement and bribery, having illegally funded ₩4 billion won ($3.6 million) to Park and her presidential office. The money came directly from the NIS&#x27; budget without oversight from the National Assembly, though the confidentiality of the financing dictates that the NIS not be obligated to disclose all expenditures.

==== Lee Myung-bak government ====
As Park Geun-hye&#x27;s predecessor, the Lee Myung-bak administration was under suspicion of involvement with the 2012 Public Opinion Manipulation scandal with the National Intelligence Service.

On 15 March 2018, Lee also admitted to receiving ₩106 million won ($100,000) of money originally allocated to the NIS. Lee denied most other corruption charges but refused to state what the ₩106 million won was used for, with many claiming that it contributed to North Korea-related activities.

== Cybersecurity ==
The National Intelligence Service in Korea is responsible for overseeing national cybersecurity policy and defending against cyber threats, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The NIS also investigates any cyber intrusions and conducts information analyses on cyber threats. The NIS&#x27; responsibility to protect networks against cyber threats has become increasingly more important following the 2009 and 2011 cyber attacks.

The South Korean National Intelligence Service implemented the Security Verification Scheme in order to amplify the security of the national information communications network. The Security Verification Scheme is a system that verifies the safety of &#x27;information security systems, network devices, and other IT products&#x27; used in government and public institutions. The NIS also established the Korea Cryptographic Module Validation Program in 2005 which focuses on validating the security and implementing &#x27;conformance of a CM for the protection of sensitive information&#x27; in both governmental and public institutions.

== Intelligence on North Korea ==
One of the National Intelligence Service&#x27;s core duties is to collect intelligence on North Korea. The primary goal of this activity is to provide the government with information to formulate inter-Korean strategies that both protect South Korea and lead towards future reunification. According to the NIS website, one of the key types of intelligence that the NIS works to gather are signs of possible North Korean provocations and potential security threats. Through surveilling these areas, they then construct measures to combat such risks. The NIS also monitors North Korea&#x27;s political, military, diplomatic, economic and social developments in order to assess their impact on inter-Korean relations and therefore assist in providing the government context to help create effective policy.

Ultimately, the NIS also claims to &#x27;support [the] establishment of a unified Korea led by the Republic of Korea&#x27;. While protecting the South from North Korean aggression, the NIS also states that one of its main goals is to simultaneously preserve international relations in order to &#x27;support [the] creation of a unified Korea under liberal democracy&#x27;.

=== Controversy ===
The National Intelligence Service has come under fire on numerous occasions for providing inaccurate intel on North Korea. In 2011, the NIS appeared to have no prior knowledge of the death of Kim Jong-il and has also failed to provide forewarning on Pyongyang&#x27;s nuclear missile tests in the past. In 2016, the accuracy of NIS intelligence was further brought into question after they were allegedly responsible for falsely reporting the death of North Korean army official Ri Yong-il, who was later found to be alive.

Former deputy director of the North Korea bureau at the NIS, Ra Jong-yil, defended the organisation, stating that &quot;in the case of the NIS, it is particularly handicapped by the fact that its main target is a country which is the most secretive, hermetically sealed from the outside&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, he argued that the NIS was at a disadvantage due to the opening up of the government which in turn resulted in their activities becoming overexposed. He theorised that in some cases this could also allow for North Korea to intentionally act deceptively in order to publicly discredit one of their main South Korean targets.

In 2016, the South Korean government voted to reduce the role of the NIS in intelligence activities and pass the duty of investigating those with ties to North Korea to the national police service. This came after numerous reports of the NIS &quot;aiding conservative politicians in elections and persecuting opposing voices by linking them to North Korea&quot;. During the 2012 election, the NIS participated in a smear-campaign against candidate Moon Jae-in that ultimately contributed to Park Geun-hye securing the win.

<text>[[Flammagenitus cloud|[[Firestorm]]]] schematic: (1) fire, (2) updraft, (3) strong gusty winds, (A) [[Flammagenitus cloud|pyrocumulonimbus cloud]] 

A flammagenitus cloud, also known as a flammagenitus, pyrocumulus cloud, or fire cloud, is a dense cumuliform cloud associated with fire or volcanic eruptions. A flammagenitus is similar dynamically in some ways to a firestorm, and the two phenomena may occur in conjunction with each other. However, either may occur without the other.

== Formation ==

A flammagenitus cloud is produced by the intense heating of the air from the surface. The intense heat induces convection, which causes the air mass to rise to a point of stability, usually in the presence of moisture. Phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires can induce formation of this cloud, by mechanisms similar to those that form homogenitus clouds. The presence of a low-level jet stream can enhance its formation. Condensation of ambient moisture (moisture already present in the atmosphere), as well as moisture evaporated from burnt vegetation or volcanic outgassing (water vapour being a dominant component of volcanic eruptive gases), occurs readily on particles of ash.
Flammageniti contain severe turbulence, manifesting as strong gusts at the surface, which can exacerbate a large conflagration. A large flammagenitus, particularly one associated with a volcanic eruption, may also produce lightning. This is a process not yet fully understood, but is probably in some way associated with charge separation induced by severe turbulence, and, perhaps, by the nature of the particles of ash in the cloud. Large flammageniti can contain temperatures well below freezing, and the electrostatic properties of any ice that forms may also play a role. A flammagenitus that produces lightning is actually a type of cumulonimbus, a thundercloud, and is called cumulonimbus flammagenitus. The World Meteorological Organization formerly classified flammagenitus and cumulonimbus flammagenitus respectively as cumulus (mediocris or congestus) and cumulonimbus. In 2017, the WMO International Cloud Atlas chose flammagenitus as the formal name of these clouds.

== Appearance ==
Flammagenitus is often grayish to brown in color because of the ash and smoke associated with the fire. It also tends to expand because the ash involved in the cloud&#x27;s formation increases the amount of condensation nuclei. 
== Effects on wildfires ==
A flammagenitus cloud can help or hinder a fire. Sometimes, the moisture from the air condenses in the cloud and falls as rain, often extinguishing the fire. There have been numerous examples of a large firestorm being extinguished by the flammagenitus that it created. However, if the fire is large enough, the cloud may continue to grow, and become a type of cumulonimbus cloud known as a cumulonimbus flammagenitus, which may produce lightning and start another fire. Even if there is no lightning, a cloud of this type can cause a sudden increase in wind speed, which could dramatically worsen the wildfire that created the cloud.

<text>John Rogers Commons (October 13, 1862 – May 11, 1945) was an American institutional economist, Georgist, progressive and labor historian at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Early years==
John R. Commons was born in Hollansburg, Ohio on October 13, 1862. Commons had a religious upbringing which led him to be an advocate for social justice early in life. Commons was considered a poor student and suffered from a mental illness while studying. He was allowed to graduate without finishing because of the potential seen in his intense determination and curiosity. At this time, Commons became a follower of Henry George&#x27;s &#x27;single tax&#x27; economics. He carried this &#x27;Georgist&#x27; or &#x27;Ricardian&#x27; approach to economics, with a focus on land and monopoly rents, throughout the rest of his life, including a proposal for income taxes with higher rates on land rents.

After graduating from Oberlin College, Commons did two years of graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he studied under Richard T. Ely, but left without a degree. After appointments at Oberlin and Indiana University, Commons began teaching at Syracuse University in 1895.

In spring 1899, Syracuse dismissed him as a radical. Eventually Commons re-entered academia at the University of Wisconsin in 1904.

Commons&#x27; early work exemplified his desire to unite Christian ideals with the emerging social sciences of sociology and economics. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Kingdom&quot; magazine, was a founder of the American Institute for Christian Sociology, and authored a book in 1894 called &quot;Social Reform and the Church.&quot; He was an advocate of temperance legislation and was active in the national Prohibition Party. By his Wisconsin years, Commons&#x27; scholarship had become less moralistic and more empirical, and he moved away from a religious viewpoint in his ethics and sociology.

==Career==

Commons is best known for developing an analysis of collective action by the state and other institutions, which he saw as essential to understanding economics. Commons believed that carefully crafted legislation could create social change; that view led him to be known as a socialist radical and incrementalist. Contrary to some published accounts, Commons did consider African Americans capable of voting. When he advocated proportional representation, he suggested a &quot;negro party&quot;. He even suggested applying the Thirteenth amendment to the Constitution to force Southern States to allow African Americans to vote. He continued the strong American tradition in institutional economics by such figures as the economist and social theorist Thorstein Veblen. His notion of transaction is one of the most important contributions to Institutional Economics. The institutional theory was closely related to his remarkable successes in fact-finding and drafting legislation on a wide range of social issues for the state of Wisconsin. He drafted legislation establishing Wisconsin&#x27;s worker&#x27;s compensation program, the first of its kind in the United States.

In 1906, Commons co-founded the American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL) with other economists.

Commons was a contributor to The Pittsburgh Survey, a 1907 sociological investigation of a single American city. His graduate student, John A. Fitch, wrote &quot;The Steel Workers&quot;, a classic depiction of a key industry in early 20th-century America. It was one of six key texts to come out of the survey. Edwin E. Witte, later known as the &quot;father of social security&quot; also did his PhD at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under Commons.

He was a leading advocate of proportional representation in the United States, writing a book on the subject in 1907 and serving as vice-president of the Proportional Representation League.

Commons undertook two major studies of the history of labor unions in the United States. Beginning in 1910, he edited &quot;A Documentary History of American Industrial Society,&quot; a large work that preserved many original-source documents of the American labor movement. Almost as soon as that work was complete, Commons began editing &quot;History of Labor in the United States&quot;, a narrative work which built on the previous 10-volume documentary history.

The first national honor society in economics, Omicron Delta Gamma (ODG), was formed on May 7, 1915, by the merger of Harvard University&#x27;s Undergraduate Society of Economics with the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Order of Artus, an economics student society modeled on King Arthur&#x27;s Knights of the Roundtable; Wisconsin&#x27;s group was advised by Commons.

In 1934, Commons published &quot;Institutional Economics&quot;, which laid out his view that institutions were made up of collective actions that, along with conflict of interests, defined the economy. He believed that institutional economics added collective control of individual transactions to existing economic theory. Commons considered the Scottish economist Henry Dunning Macleod to be the &quot;originator&quot; of Institutional economics.

Commons was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1936.

==Death and legacy==
He died on May 11, 1945.

Today, Commons&#x27;s contribution to labor history is considered equal to his contributions to the theory of institutional economics. He also made valuable contributions to the history of economic thought, especially with regard to collective action. He is honored at the University of Wisconsin in Madison with rooms and clubs named for him.

Commons was the mentor of many outstanding economists and has been credited with originating the &quot;Wisconsin Idea,&quot; in which university faculty serve as advisors to state government.

His former home, The John R. and Nell Commons House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The John R. Commons Award is awarded biennially to an outstanding economist in recognition of academic achievements and for service both to the economics profession and to Omicron Delta Epsilon. The award is given at American Economic Association conference where the honoree presents a &quot;Commons Lecture&quot; which is later published in &quot;The American Economist&quot;. Over the years, the Commons Award has served as an indicator of recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Nine Commons Award winners have won the Nobel Prize; most recently, Claudia Goldin (2009) won the Nobel in 2023.

<text>Carinate is a shape in pottery, glassware and artistic design usually applied to amphorae or vases. The shape is defined by the joining of a rounded base to the sides of an inward sloping vessel. This design is seen in ancient cultures such as recovered in archaeological digs in such sites as the palace of Knossos in Minoan Crete. An alternative adjectival form of this design is carinated.

<text>Ballinamore (, meaning &quot;mouth of the big ford&quot;) is a small town in the south-east of County Leitrim in Ireland.

==Etymology==
, corrupted &quot;Bellanamore&quot;, means &quot;town at the mouth of the big ford&quot;, so named because it was a main crossing (ford) of the Yellow River. The gaels called the baile Átha na Chuirre (&quot;homestead of ford of the afflictions&quot;) because a hospital-house stood near the bridge in the 13th century.

==Location==
Ballinamore is in the south-east of County Leitrim in the North Midlands of Ireland, the town being from the county boundary with County Fermanagh. The town is built on the Yellow River. The R202 regional road intersects the R199 and R204 roads here. A historic barge waterway, built in the 1840s to connect the Erne and Shannon rivers, was reopened for boat traffic in 1994 as the Shannon–Erne Waterway. Ballinamore has daily Local-link bus services to Carrick-on-Shannon and Dromod railway station, Monday to Saturday.

==History==
After the 5th century, the Conmaicne settled this area, displacing and absorbing an older tribe named the &quot;Masraigh&quot;. These Conmhaícne ancestors were called the &quot;Cenel Luachán&quot;. This is the origins of Ballinamore.

In 1244, the town () was named Áth na Chuirre (&quot;ford of the afflictions&quot;) because, according to the Irish Annals, a hospital dedicated to &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot; () stood beside the ford. Saint Bridget&#x27;s church, and holy-well, stood on a high hill one kilometre north of present-day town.

In 1256, the Battle of Magh Slecht occurred nearby, leading to the division of Bréifne between the O&#x27;Rourkes of North Leitrim and the O&#x27;Reillys of East Bréifne (modern-day County Cavan). 
In 1621, the name &#x27;Ballinamore&#x27; is first mentioned, when under the Plantation of Leitrim, the &quot;Manor of Ballinamore&quot; was granted to Sir Fenton Parsons with of arable land.

Around 1693, Ballinamore Iron works was established, and in production until circa 1747 when the business was put up for sale, the assets including a furnace, forge, slitting mill, mine yards, coal yards, large quantities of pig iron, mine and coals. The native Irish forests bounding the parish were exhausted for this mining.

In the 18th century, dispossessed Catholics from County Down settled in the area.

In 1860, the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was opened, but declined in use after 24 October 1887, the date Ballinamore railway station opened. The railway station was part of the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway and was the hub of the line, with the locomotive depot and works. It was the point where the line from Dromod through Mohill and Ballinamore to Belturbet branched to Kiltubrid, Drumshanbo and Arigna. The railway line was used until closure on 1 April 1959.

In the 19th, and early 20th centuries, annual fairs were held at Ballinamore on- 12 May, and 12 November.

In 1925, Ballinamore town comprised 163 houses, approximately 28 being licensed to sell alcohol.

In 1994, the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was reopened as the Shannon–Erne Waterway and marketed as a tourist/cruising waterway.

===Annalistic references===
Various Irish Annals mention the &quot;baile&quot; of &quot;Áth na Cuirre&quot;, i.e. Ballinamore, in 1244 AD. A Connachta army marched from nearby Fenagh towards the &quot;baile&quot;, presumably along the R202 route. At the Yellow River ford, today&#x27;s bridge into the Main Street, the soldiers vandalised the nearby Hospital of Saint John the Baptist, accidentally killing one of their own, an important leader of Clann Murtagh O&#x27;Connor named Mhaghnusa mic Muircertaig Muimnigh.

===Don Tidey kidnapping===
In 1983, members of the Provisional IRA kidnapped Quinnsworth managing director Don Tidey, holding him captive in Derrada Woods, outside of the town. Garda Gary Sheehan (police officer) and Private Patrick Kelly were murdered during a rescue attempt. Historians believe local Sinn Féin politician John Joe McGirl assisted the kidnappers in holding Tidey at the location.

==Notable features==
The local Church of Ireland church is the oldest building in Ballinamore in the 1780s from the ruins of the local Roman Catholic Church (St Patrick&#x27;s) demolished during the reformation and penal laws.

The nearby Ballinamore Estate was granted to the Ormsby family in 1677. Elizabethan settlers located at first in County Sligo, from where they spread into Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway. The Ballinamore branch were descended from the Ormsby of Comyn or Cummin in County Sligo.

There is a monument to the IRA Chief of Staff, TD, and local councillor John Joe McGirl on an island on the Shannon-Erne Waterway.

==Sport==

Ballinamore Seán O&#x27;Heslin&#x27;s GAA are the local Gaelic games club.

==Popular culture==
Christy Moore released a song called &quot;The Ballad of Ballinamore&quot; in 1984, giving the writing credits to Fintan Vallely. Later compilations have referred to the song as simply &quot;Ballinamore&quot;. The song was a parody of an earlier Irish rebel song called &quot;The Man from the Daily Mail&quot;. It was written after an RTÉ investigation in the Ballinamore area for evidence of the abducted racehorse Shergar (believed to be abducted by the Provisional IRA) found several locals refusing to say anything other than &quot;no comment&quot;.

<text>Royal Air Force Syerston, commonly known simply as RAF Syerston , is a Royal Air Force station in the parish of Flintham, near Newark, Nottinghamshire, England. Opened in 1940, it was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a bomber base during the Second World War, operating Vickers Wellingtons, Avro Manchesters, and the Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Post-war, it became home to Jet Provosts of the 2 Flying Training School. It is now home to the Royal Air Force Central Gliding School.

==History==
===Bomber Command===


RAF Syerston was built as part of the bomber expansion in the late 1930s, but did not open until 1 December 1940. The first aircraft were Vickers Wellingtons crewed by Polish flyers who had joined the RAF. In July 1941, they were replaced by members of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), flying Handley-Page Hampdens. From December 1941 until 5 May 1942, the base was closed whilst a concrete runway was built with two T2 hangars. When it re-opened, it became part of No. 5 Group. In 1942, several squadrons of Avro Lancaster aircraft arrived. No. 61 Conversion Flight between May and August 1942 with Manchesters and Lancasters and No. 408 Conversion Flight between May and June 1942 used the airfield supporting their respective squadrons. The airfield was used as a Relief Landing Ground for No. 16 (Polish) SFTS during Winter 1942/43

In March 1943, Wing Commander Guy Gibson was commanding officer of 106 Sqn at Syerston, before he was given the task of forming 617 Sqn – &quot;The Dambusters&quot;, at RAF Coningsby.

On 3/4 November 1943, Bill Reid of 61 Squadron was awarded a Victoria Cross on a mission flown from Syerston.

On 17 November 1943, the operational squadrons departed, and the station was used for bomber crew training, led by Captain Robert White. No. 1668 Heavy Conversion Unit joined on 17 November 1943 and became No. 5 Lancaster Finishing School four days later. No. 1485 (Bombing) Gunnery Flight between November 1943 and February 1944. From November 1943 to July 1944, there was also No. 1690 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight in attendance with several Wellingtons, Spitfires, Hurricanes, plus a few Martinet tug aircraft; all employed in brushing up the skills of air gunners on air-to-air exercises. The LFS left on 1 April 1945, with No. 49 Squadron arriving from RAF Fulbeck later in the month who only had one operation before leaving to RAF Mepal in September. Bomber Command Film Flight Unit between April and October 1945 used the airfield.

===Post-war use===

On 25 October 1945, the station became part of Transport Command with No. 1668 Heavy Conversion Unit RAF arriving from RAF Leicester East, which stayed until 5 January 1948 when it moved to RAF Dishforth. No. 1331 Heavy Transport Conversion Unit reformed here on 15 December 1946 with the Halifax A.7, the unit was disbanded on 5 January 1948. No. 1333 (Transport Support) Conversion Unit arrived October 1945, absorbing No. 1385 Heavy Transport Conversion Unit during July 1946, became No. 1333 Transport Support Training Unit during July 1946 then moved to North Luffenham during January 1948.

Syerston was taken over by Flying Training Command on 1 February 1948, when No. 22 Service Flying Training School (22 SFTS) arrived from RAF Ouston, the unit was renamed to No. 22 FTS one day later, the unit trained pilots for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Other nearby RAF airfields used for flying circuits were RAF Newton (February 1948 - November 1951) and RAF Tollerton (November 1951 - May 1955). The training school became No. 1 Flying Training School (1 FTS) on 1 May 1955. In November 1953, Percival Provosts began being used, being replaced by the (Hunting Percival) Jet Provost in 1959. The flying training school was disbanded on 16 January 1970 when the need for pilots had diminished, and the station lay vacant. Syerston was placed under care and maintenance from 1971 and used as a Relief Landing Ground for RAF College during 1972.

==Role and operations==

643 VGS joined in October 1992, followed by No. 645 VGS from April 1998 until 2005. Most of the original station buildings were demolished in 1997 except for two hangars, the air traffic control tower, and one H-block.

In January 2014, the Central Gliding School (CGS) and No. 644 Volunteer Gliding Squadron have been based at Syerston.

2014 saw the reformation of No. 2 Flying Training School (2 FTS) at Syerston, along with a permanent home for Headquarters No. 2 Flying Training School (HQ 2 FTS), the Royal Air Force Central Gliding School (RAF CGS), and No. 644 Volunteer Gliding Squadron (644 VGS).

==Incidents==
On 20 September 1958, the prototype Avro Vulcan VX770 crashed during a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain &quot;At Home&quot; display. A Rolls-Royce test pilot was authorised to fly VX770 on an engine performance sortie with a fly past at the Battle of Britain display. The briefing was for the pilot to fly over the airfield twice at , flying at a speed of . The Vulcan flew along the main 07/25 runway (now 06/24 due to magnetic shift), then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly. Very shortly after, a kink appeared in the starboard mainplane leading edge, followed by a stripping of the leading edge of the wing. The starboard wingtip then broke, followed by a collapse of the main spar and wing structure. Subsequently, the Vulcan went into a dive, and began rolling with the starboard wing on fire, and struck the ground at the taxiway end of runway 07. Three occupants of a controllers&#x27; caravan were killed by debris, a fourth being injured. All the crew of the Vulcan were killed. Proposed causes of the accident have included pilot error, fatigue failure, and inadequate maintenance.

<text>Ballybunion or Ballybunnion () is a coastal town and seaside resort in County Kerry, Ireland, on the Wild Atlantic Way, from the town of Listowel. As of the 2022 census, Ballybunion had a population of 1,618.

==Name==
The Placenames Database of Ireland associates the town&#x27;s Irish language name, or the &#x27;town(land) of An Buinneánach&#x27;, with the Anglo-Norman surname &quot;Bunyan&quot;. The Bunyan (Bonzon) family were historically associated with Ballybunion Castle.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes promontory fort and ring fort sites in the townlands of Ballybunion and Doon West. 

Ballybunion Castle was built in the early 16th century, on the site of an earlier promontory fort, by the (Geraldine) Fitzmaurice family. The castle was associated with the Bunyan family until the late 16th century, when William Óg Bunyan&#x27;s lands were confiscated following the Desmond Rebellion. The castle has been a protected national monument since the 1920s.

A number of buildings within the town itself date to the 19th century, with the former Church of Ireland church (now a public library) and the Roman Catholic church dating to 1879 and 1897 respectively.

==Tourism==
Ballybunion has two main beaches, divided by the Castle Green. The Ladies Beach is to the right and the Men&#x27;s Beach to the left – names arising from the fact that both sexes previously swam on separate beaches. Further to the left of the Men&#x27;s Beach lies the Long Strand, a 3.2 km stretch of sand, overlooked by the sand dunes of Ballybunion Golf Club.

In the summer, Ballybunion attracts tourists, and the beaches near Ballybunion are a common surfing site, with a dedicated surf school on the Men&#x27;s Beach. Other traditions include seaweed baths, featuring sea water with serrated wrack. The town itself has a number of restaurants, pubs and cafes, and schools. A statue in the town commemorates a golfing visit, in 1998, by then US President Bill Clinton.

==Sport==
===Golf===
Ballybunion Golf Club was founded in 1893 and was previously ranked at number seven in &quot;Golf Digest&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Courses Outside the USA&quot;. There are 2 courses, the Old Course and the Cashen Course, both situated beside the beach. The club hosted the Murphy&#x27;s Irish Open in 2000 and the Palmer Cup in 2004.

===Gaelic football===
The local Gaelic football team, Beale GAA club, is named for a small townland a couple of miles up the coast from Ballybunion. Founded in 1972, the club&#x27;s colours are green and red. It fields teams in competitions organised by the North Kerry Football Board.

The club&#x27;s grounds, at Stack Park, are situated off Sandhill Road. This floodlight pitch provides training and matches for several divisions of players (incl under 8s, 10s, junior, and senior) as well as ladies football.

===Health and leisure===

Ballybunion Health &amp; Leisure Centre opened in 2007 and is situated on Kit Ahern Road.

<doc id="991567" wikidata="Q445029" url="?curid=991567" title="Quadratus of Athens">
<text>Quadratus of Athens (; fl. 2nd century) was an early Christian apologist, traditionally regarded as a disciple of the Apostles and one of the Seventy Apostles. He is celebrated as one of the earliest Christian apologists, best known for presenting an apology to Emperor Hadrian during his visit to Athens around 124–125 CE. His work, which defended the Christian faith against its critics, highlighted the enduring impact of Jesus&#x27; miracles through firsthand testimony. Quadratus is also associated with the apostolic tradition and is recognized as the Bishop of Athens, succeeding Saint Publius. His feast day is observed on May 26 in the Roman Catholic Church and September 21 in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Life ==

=== Background ===
Quadratus was born near the end of the first century CE, likely in the region of Asia Minor. According to Wallace, J. W. (2017), in &quot;Forensic Faith&quot;, the birth year is estimated to be around 60 CE.

Quadratus was part of the second generation of Jesus&#x27; followers. According to the early church historian Eusebius of Caesarea, Quadratus was a disciple of the Apostles (&quot;auditor apostolorum&quot;), as noted in &quot;Chronicon&quot;. In his early years, he traveled as an itinerant preacher, spreading the Gospel and journeying through regions such as Asia Minor. It was during these travels that he gathered firsthand accounts from individuals who had directly witnessed Jesus&#x27; acts of kindness and miracles. Later, after settling in Athens, Quadratus, much like other Athenian apologists such as Aristides and Athenagoras, did not hold a formal position within the Church hierarchy. Instead, he was an independent teacher, freely sharing his knowledge and faith. Writing in 1754, Historian John A. Giles refers to Quadratus and Aristides as former philosophers.

=== &quot;Apology&quot; ===
Eusebius records that Quadratus presented a discourse to Emperor Hadrian during the emperor&#x27;s visit to Athens in 124 or 125 CE, his discourse was titled &quot;Apology&quot;. As detailed in Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (Book IV, Chapter 3), the apology aimed to defend Christianity against its critics and was widely circulated among early Christian communities. Eusebius praised the work as a demonstration of Quadratus&#x27;s intellectual rigor and his dedication to upholding apostolic teachings. The surviving fragment of the discourse shares Quadratus&#x27;s reflections on the enduring impact of Jesus&#x27;s miracles, asserting their authenticity and lasting significance. The excerpt reads:&quot;But the works of our Saviour were always present, for they were genuine:—those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Saviour was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day.&quot;

=== Bishop of Athens ===
According to Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, Quadratus was appointed Bishop of Athens following the martyrdom of Saint Publius. The letter states that through Quadratus&#x27; zeal, the Athenian Christians were reunited, and their faith was revitalized. He become the third Bishop of Athens sometime during the first half of the second century. Although this claim is disputed as the third office Bishop was held around 180 CE, surpassing his approximate death year of 130 CE.

== Identity and attribution ==
The identity and attribution of work relating to Quadratus of Athens has been a subject of scholarly debate.

=== Attribution ===
In 1947, P. Andriessen proposed that Quadratus&#x27; Apology might be the work known as the &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot;, a theory that Michael W. Holmes later described as &quot;intriguing&quot;. Holmes noted that, although the &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot; does not contain the sole known quotation from Quadratus&#x27; address, there exists a gap between chapters 7.6 and 7.7 where it could potentially fit. However, Edgar J. Goodspeed found this theory improbable, stating that the fragment does not align with the gap.

=== Identity ===
Theologian Otto Bardenhewer, in &quot;Patrology&quot; (1908), proposed that Quadratus the Apologist might be the same person as Quadratus, a prophet mentioned by Eusebius in &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (3.37). However, this identification has been questioned, with the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1913) dismissing the evidence as insufficient. Efforts to associate Quadratus&#x27; Apology with the &quot;Letter to Diognetus&quot;, martyr accounts, or the &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot; legend have similarly failed to yield convincing evidence.

The identification of Quadratus the Apologist with Quadratus, the Bishop of Athens, remains uncertain due to chronological inconsistencies. While The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot; suggests the possibility of this link, Jerome erroneously conflated the Apologist with the Bishop who served during Marcus Aurelius&#x27; reign (161–180). Eusebius&#x27; claim that Quadratus was a prophet and apostolic disciple is also considered improbable. 

Similarly, attempts to link Quadratus the Apologist with Quadratus, the Bishop of Athens, who served around 180 CE, face challenges due to chronological discrepancies. Nonetheless, &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot; argues that &quot;there is perhaps no compelling reason to reject his identification with the Bishop of Athens.&quot;

== Beliefs ==
Quadratus&#x27; language suggests that Christ&#x27;s time on earth was a temporary sojourn, indicating his divine pre-existence before incarnation. He emphasized the lasting testimony of individuals healed or raised from the dead by Jesus, framing these miracles as genuine and enduring evidence of Christ&#x27;s divine power. Quadratus applied the title &quot;Soter&quot; to Jesus, a term with divine connotations in both Jewish and Hellenistic traditions, suggesting Christ&#x27;s superiority to pagan deities. Eusebius praised Quadratus&#x27; orthodoxy, aligning his Christological views with apostolic teachings, including the deity and miraculous works of Jesus. Theologian Dr. John H. Roller contends that he aligns with Christian conditionalism.

== Death and legacy ==

=== Death ===
His preaching to pagans resulted in imprisonment where he died of starvation around the year 129 CE.

=== Legacy ===
Quadratus&#x27; legacy lies in his role as one of the earliest Christian apologists, presenting a defense of the Christian faith during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. His &quot;Apology&quot; attests to the early efforts of Christians to engage with Roman authorities and intellectuals to justify their beliefs. He is noted for emphasizing apostolic tradition, a foundation that Eusebius regarded as proof of his orthodoxy. Eusebius described him as both intelligent and orthodox, likely seeing the alignment of Quadratus&#x27; teachings with those of the apostles as a measure of his credibility. This orthodoxy was seen as rooted in both his adherence to apostolic tradition and the strength of his arguments.

Quadratus is recognized as one of the early saints of the Orthodox Christian Church and one of the Seventy Apostles. His feast day is celebrated annually on September 21st, and he is also commemorated on January 4th alongside the other Seventy Apostles. According to Britannica, his feast day for Roman Catholic Church is May 26.

<text>Ballydehob () is a coastal village in the southwest of County Cork, Ireland. It is 13 km west of Skibbereen and 13 km south of Bantry.

==History==
During the Bronze Age (2200-600 B.C.), copper was mined on Mount Gabriel, just west of the village. About the same time, stone circles, wedge and boulder tombs were constructed in the area. The Celts arrived at some later time and in the early historic period, various clans fought for dominance, until the eventual emergence of the McCarthys and O&#x27;Mahonys as the rulers of the region. A string of castles was built along the coastline. Kilcoe Castle was the McCarthy&#x27;s most westerly stronghold and their only coastal foothold. It has since been renovated and rebuilt by its actor owner Jeremy Irons.

In 1602, soldiers led by Sir George Carew, Lord President of Munster, descended on the area in a successful bid to break the power of the Irish clan chieftains. Their passage through West Cork was described in &quot;&quot;Pacata Hibernia&quot; by Thomas Stafford from the invaders&#x27;s point of view. The events were also captured, from a native Irish perspective, in &quot;Historicae Catolicae Iberniae Compendium&quot;&quot; by Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare.

The 17th century saw an influx of settlers mainly from England, as well as a number of Protestants (Huguenots) also fleeing persecution by the Catholic Royal House of Bourbon in France. The Swantons from Norfolk emerged as one of the most prominent Anglo-Irish families in the locality, and by the late 18th century they had succeeded in changing the name of Ballydehob to Swanton&#x27;s Town. The last known use of the name Swanton&#x27;s Town was in the census of 1821.

In the 1820s, copper mining developed again in the region. The Cappagh mine was financed by Lord Audley; its chimney survived until February 2002, when it was destroyed by a lightning strike. A feature of this mining era was the introduction to Ballydehob of a police constabulary and barracks, approximately 6 years before the first London police force. By the 1840s the population of the area had swelled to nearly 20,000. Then disaster struck when the potato crop failed and the Great Irish Famine resulted (1845-1849). This affected Ballydehob and the whole of West Cork in a most devastating way; thousands died and thousands more emigrated. Between 1841 and 1851 the population of the area fell by 42%, a decline which was much higher than the national average. As of the 2016 census, Ballydehob had a resident population of about 270.

In the 1880s, amid growing agitation over land reform, the Ballydehob branch of the Irish National Land League hosted a visit by Anna Parnell, sister of Charles Stewart Parnell, to address a public meeting on the subject. This was held in the field where St. Brigit&#x27;s school now stands, and is commemorated by a plaque.

In the 1960s, the Ballydehob area saw an influx of artists, writers and craftspeople, often referred to as &#x27;blow-ins&#x27;, and for a brief period a number of &quot;hippy&quot; communes were established in the area, latterly dubbed the &quot;Ballydehob Bohemians&quot;. One house was decorated with painted flowers, becoming known as the &quot;Flower House&quot;. This house, which included a shop, gallery and studios, was originally opened in 1968 by Christa Reichel and Norah Golden who together formed the Ballydehob Artists Ltd.

Ballydehob lies within a tourist area in West Cork and has a number of guest-houses and private holiday homes.

==Festivals==
Festivals in Ballydehob include the Ballydehob Traditional Music Weekend (an annual traditional music, song, and dance festival), the Ballydehob Jazz Festival, Ballydehob Country Music Festival, Fastnet Maritime and Folk Festival, and West Cork Yoga Festival.

The &#x27;Gathering of the Boats&#x27;, or &quot;Cruinniu na mBad&quot;, also takes place annually with families meeting the flotilla of working boats and other traditional sailing vessels at Ballydehob Quay.

Ballydehob Old Time Threshing &amp; Vintage Weekend celebrates the historic traditions of rural Ireland and generally takes place over a weekend in October.

==Transport==
===Road===
The R592 road forms Main Street in village. The R592 joins N71 road by Ballydehob Bridge. By the N71 road, Bantry is 17 km to the north and Skibbereen 15 km to the east.

===Bus===
As at 2024 there are a few Bus Éireann services (and occasional Local Link services) to Bantry, Skibbereen and other nearby places.

===Rail===

There is no longer a station in or near Ballydehob. The nearest station is now in Killarney.

On 6 September 1886 Ballydehob railway station opened on the narrow gauge Schull and Skibbereen Railway with a large sports event held in Ballydehob to mark the occasion. At the time there was a 15 m.p.h. speed limit on the railway. The line&#x27;s 12 arch bridge dominates the Ballydehob estuary. Mounting losses, coal shortages and the arrival of buses and motor cars eventually brought the closure of the line. The final train ran on 27 January 1947 and the station finally closed altogether on 1 June 1953. Ballydehob was the main intermediate station on the railway.

<text>Bantry () is a town in the civil parish of Kilmocomoge in the barony of Bantry on the southwest coast of County Cork, Ireland. It lies in West Cork at the head of Bantry Bay, a deep-water gulf extending for to the west. The Beara Peninsula is to the northwest, with Sheep&#x27;s Head peninsula to the southwest.

The focus of the town is a large square, formed partly by infilling of the shallow inner harbour. In former times, this accommodated regular cattle fairs; after modernising as an urban plaza, it now features a weekly market and occasional public functions. Two piers protect the harbour.

Bantry is in the Dáil constituency of Cork South-West.

== History ==
As with other areas on Ireland&#x27;s southwest coast, Bantry also claims an ancient connection to the sixth-century saint Breandán (Naomh Bréanainn) the Navigator. In Irish lore, Saint Breandán was the first person to discover America. To the west of the town is the graveyard marking the site of a 15th-century Franciscan friary, of which nothing remains. Saint Cannera, who lived as a hermitess in the area during the sixth century, is also associated with the parish.

In past centuries, Bantry was a base for major pilchard fisheries and was visited by fishing fleets from Spain, France and the Netherlands. It was still a very small town in 1689 when it was described by the Jacobite army officer and future author John Stevens as &quot;a miserable poor place, hardly worth the name of a town&quot;, consisting of &quot;seven or eight small houses, and some mean little cottages&quot;. Wolfe Tone Square in the town commemorates Theobald Wolfe Tone, a leader during the 1798 rebellion. In the lead up to the rebellion, Dublin-born Tone led the republican United Irishmen in what he had hoped would be a local re-run of the recent French Revolution; this was to be achieved with the help of French Republicans in overthrowing British rule. The ill-fated French invasion fleet, known as the French expedition to Ireland, arrived in the area in 1796, but its purpose was frustrated by unfavourable winds. For his efforts in preparing the local defences against the French, Richard White, a local landowner, was created Baron Bantry in 1797 by a grateful British administration. A Viscountcy followed in 1800 and in 1816 he became the 1st Earl of Bantry. The mansion and gardens in the Bantry House demesne on the outskirts of the town testify to the family&#x27;s status.
During the Irish War of Independence, the 5th and 3rd Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army were active in Bantry, and some members remained so during the Civil War that followed. Action by British forces included the punitive firebombing of several buildings in the town. The names of those who died between 1920 and 1923 &quot;In Defence of the Republic&quot; are listed on the wall of the former courthouse in Wolfe Tone Square.

Sheltering the head of the bay is Whiddy Island, site of a large oil terminal, originally owned by Gulf Oil. On 8 January 1979 the oil tanker &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; exploded, killing all 42 crew members, as well as seven employees at the terminal. The jetty was seriously damaged, but the storage tanks were not affected. Nevertheless, 250 employees at the terminal, one of the largest employers in the region, lost their jobs. There was also significant environmental impact and the local fishing industry was affected. Local interests subsequently initiated mussel-farming in the sheltered waters between Whiddy and the town.

In 1986, Gulf Oil surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. State investment in the 1990s restored part of the terminal and the Irish Government arranged for oil to be stored there during the First Gulf War in case of disruption to oil supplies; it currently holds one-third of the national strategic petroleum reserve. The facility passed from state ownership in 2001 with the proviso that it would remain operational for at least 15 years. It has since been owned and operated by US oil companies Tosco Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and Zenith Energy Partners. At the time of acquisition by Zenith Energy Partners, the facility employed 30 people and supported up to 100 contractors. It has a storage capacity of more than eight million barrels of crude oil and refined products. The terminal saw a 15% decrease in oil traffic during 2015, according to figures released by the Port of Cork which operates the Bantry Bay port.

Bantry made headlines in 2007 when the attempted landing of a cocaine shipment on the nearby coast was foiled, and again in 2017 when a &quot;cocaine factory&quot; was discovered in the area.

==Buildings of note==

Bantry House is located west of the town and has been home to the White family since 1739 – sometimes Earls of Bantry. It contains a number of historic artefacts and paintings and is surrounded by formal gardens.

Other landmarks include Bantry Market House, and the Catholic and Church of Ireland parish churches. The public library and Garda (police) station are examples of modern architecture in the town.

== Economy ==
The town is a service centre for a large catchment area, including both the Beara and Sheep&#x27;s Head peninsulas. Livestock fairs were held in the square in the past. It is no longer a major fishing port, mussel-farming having replaced the traditional trawling. Tourism has been a major part of the economy since the 19th century, exploiting the coastal scenery of the region, and the town contains a number of hotels and guesthouses. There are small-scale local industries, including pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and building materials. Bantry became a Fairtrade Town in 2006.

Bantry hosts two cultural events each summer – the West Cork Chamber Music Festival and the West Cork Literary Festival. These feature musicians and writers of international stature, with performances at various venues in the town.

Bantry held the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship in July 2012, in which 15 nations competed.

The inner harbour contains a marina comprising 40 berths and associated facilities, opened in 2017.

== Transport ==
Bantry is accessed by the N71 national secondary road. Scheduled bus services connect the town with Cork city, Killarney, Castletownbere via Glengarriff (17 km north of Bantry) and some smaller local centres.

In the early 20th century, there was a regular steamship service from Bantry to Castletowbere on the Beara Peninsula. The also serving Glengarriff and Adrigole. Improvements to the roads and land transport eventually made this uneconomic.

As of the early 21st century, Bantry has been a port of call for smaller cruise liners, which anchor between the town and Whiddy Island.

Bantry has its own small privately owned airfield called Bantry Aerodrome, though the nearest large international airport is Cork Airport. Cork Airport is served by direct Bus Éireann buses from Bantry in the summer tourist season.

Bantry Town railway station, the western terminus of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, opened on 22 October 1892, but finally closed on 1 April 1961, and was subsequently demolished.

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, Bantry had a usually resident population of 2,858. Of these, 70.4% identified as White Irish, 1.1% as White Irish Travellers and 15.0% as other white ethnicities. A further 0.6% identified as Black or Black Irish, 4.0% as Asian or Asian Irish and 2.2% as other ethnicities. 6.7% of the population did not state their ethnicity.

<text>Mavis Taillieu (born August 8, 1952) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 2003 to 2013, representing the opposition Progressive Conservative Party and served as the critic of Culture, Heritage and Tourism, Family Services and Housing, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Advanced education and Literacy, and Infrastructure and Transportation. She also was opposition house leader and caucus whip.

Taillieu holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Winnipeg. Before entering public life she was a Registered Laboratory Technologist, and worked in the health care field for fifteen years. Taillieu has also been a successful entrepreneur. She was the founder of the &quot;Headingley Headliner&quot;, a local newspaper covering developments in Headingley, Manitoba, where she still resides. In 1996, she received a &quot;Community Development Award&quot; for her work with this newspaper.

In the 2003 election, Taillieu was elected to the provincial legislature for the rural riding of Morris, located to the immediate southwest of Winnipeg. This riding is considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives; Taillieu was elected with over 57% of the popular vote, despite the party&#x27;s poor showing in other parts of the province.

In the federal election of 2004, Taillieu campaigned on behalf of Conservative Party of Canada candidate Steven Fletcher. She was re-elected in the 2007 and 2011 provincial elections.

Taillieu resigned her seat on February 12, 2013, citing family and health reasons.

<text>Murshidabad (, or ) is a historical city in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located on the eastern bank of the Bhagirathi River, a distributary of the Ganges. It forms part of the Murshidabad district.

During the 18th century, Murshidabad was a prosperous city. It was the capital of the Bengal Subah for seventy years, with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. It was the seat of the hereditary Nawab of Bengal and the state&#x27;s treasury, revenue office and judiciary. Murshidabad was a cosmopolitan city. Its population peaked at 100,000 in the 1750s. It was home to wealthy banking and merchant families from different parts of the Indian subcontinent and wider Eurasia, including the Jagat Seth and Armenians.

European companies, including the British East India Company, the French East India Company, the Dutch East India Company and the Danish East India Company, conducted business and operated factories around the city. Silk was a major product of Murshidabad. The city was also a center of art and culture, including ivory sculptors, Hindustani classical music and the Murshidabad style of Mughal painting.

The city&#x27;s decline began with the defeat of the last independent Nawab of Bengal Siraj-ud-Daulah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The Nawab was demoted to the status of a zamindar known as the Nawab of Murshidabad. The British shifted the treasury, courts and revenue office to Calcutta. In the 19th century, the population was estimated to be 46,000. Murshidabad became a district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. It was declared as a municipality in 1869.

==Etymology==
Murshidabad was named after its founder, Nawab Murshid Quli Khan. &quot;Murshid&quot; is an Arabic term for a teacher or guide with integrity, sensibility, and maturity. The suffix &quot;-abad&quot; is derived from the Persian word &quot;abad&quot;, which referred to a cultivated place.

==Geography==
===Location===
Murshidabad is located at .

Hazarduari Palace and its associated sites in the Kila Nizamat area (forming the central area in the map alongside) is the centre of attraction in Murshidabad. Just a little away are Katra Masjid, Fauti Mosque, Jama Masjid and the Motijhil area. There is a group of attractions in the northern part of the town (as can be seen in the map alongside). Some attractions such as Khushbagh, Rosnaiganj, Baranagar, Kiriteswari Temple, Karnasuvarna and others are on the other side of the river and there are attractions in the neighbouring Berhampore area also (not shown in the map).

==History==


The area was part of the Gauda Kingdom and Vanga Kingdom in ancient Bengal. The &quot;Riyaz-us-Salatin&quot; credited the initial development of the town to a merchant named Makhsus Khan. The merchant&#x27;s role is also mentioned in the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;.

During the 17th-century, the area was well known for sericulture. In 1621, English agents reported that large quantities of silk were available in the area. During the 1660s, it became a pargana of the Mughal administration, with jurisdiction over European companies in Cossimbazar.

In the early 18th-century, Murshid Quli Khan, the prime minister of Bengal Subah, had a bitter rivalry with Prince Azim-ush-Shan, the viceroy of Bengal. The latter even attempted to have Khan killed. The Mughal court in Delhi was also rapidly losing authority in much of the subcontinent. Amid the decline of the central government, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar promoted Khan to the status of a princely Nawab. As Nawab, Khan was given the opportunity to create a princely dynasty as part of the Mughal aristocracy.

Murshid Quli Khan shifted the capital of Bengal from Dhaka, which lost its strategic importance after the expulsion of the Arakanese and Portuguese from Chittagong. He founded the city of Murshidabad and named the city after himself. It became the center of political, economic and cultural life in Bengal. The jurisdiction of the Nawab included not only Bengal, but also Bihar and Orissa. Murshidabad was also located centrally in the expanded jurisdiction of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.

The presence of the princely court, the Mughal Army, artisans and multiethnic merchants increased the wealth of Murshidabad. Wealthy families and companies established their head offices in the city. The Murshidabad mint became the largest in Bengal, with a value amounting to two percent of the minted currency. The city witnessed the construction of administrative buildings, gardens, palaces, mosques, temples and mansions. European companies operated factories in the city&#x27;s outskirts. The city was full of brokers, workers, peons, naibs, wakils, and ordinary traders.

Murshid Quli Khan transformed Murshidabad into a capital city with an efficient administrative machinery for his successors. He built a palace and a caravanserai with a grand mosque, known as the Katra Masjid. The main military base was located near the mosque and formed the city&#x27;s eastern gateway. The third Nawab Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan patronized the construction of another palace and military base, a new gateway, the revenue office, a public audience hall (durbar), a private chamber, the treasury and a mosque in an extensive compound called Farrabagh (Garden of Joy) which included canals, fountains, flowers, and fruit trees.

Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah established a palace near the Motijhil (Pearl Lake). The Nizamat Imambara was built for Shia Muslims. The palace complex was fortified and known as the Nizamat Fort. The main entrances of the Nizamat Fort had musicians&#x27; galleries. The gates were high, imposing and tall enough for an elephant to pass through. The Khoshbagh garden was the burial place of the Nawabs. The city had a Bengali majority population, including Bengali Muslims and Bengali Hindus. There was an influential Jain community involved in trade and commerce. An Armenian community also settled and became financiers for the Nawab. The Jagat Seth were one of the prominent banking families of Murshidabad. They controlled money lending activities and served as financiers for administrators, merchants, traders, the Nawabs, the Zamindars, as well as the British, French, Armenians and Dutch. The merchants built many mansions, including the Azimganj Rajbati, Kathgola house and Nashipur house.

The Nawabs of Bengal entered into agreements with numerous European trading companies allowing them to establish bases in the region. The French East India Company operated factories in Murshidabad and Dhaka. The British East India Company was based in Fort William. Murshidabad was a part of the Dutch Bengal Department. The Ostend Company of Austria established a base near Murshidabad. The Danish East India Company also set up trading posts in the Bengal Subah.

The last independent Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah was overthrown in 1757. Despite receiving assurances of French support, the Nawab was betrayed by his commander Mir Jafar. The British installed Mir Jafar&#x27;s family as a puppet dynasty and eventually reduced the Nawab to the status of a landlord (zamindar). The British continued to collect revenue from the area&#x27;s factories. The merchant families continued to prosper under company rule in India. In 1858, the British government gained direct control of India&#x27;s administration.

Murshidabad was very badly affected by the Bengal Famine of 1770. 

Murshidabad was a district city of the Bengal Presidency. Warren Hastings removed the supreme civil and criminal courts to Calcutta in 1772, but in 1775 the latter courts were brought back to Murshidabad again. In 1790, under Lord Cornwallis, the entire revenue and judicial staffs were moved to Calcutta. The city was still the residence of the Nawab, who ranked as the first nobleman of the province with the style of Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, instead of Nawab Nazim of Bengal. The Hazarduari Palace was built in 1837 as a residence for both the Nawab and British civil servants. Murshidabad became a municipality in 1869. The population in 1901 was 15,168. The silk industry was revived with assistance from the government. The area also became notable for mango and litchi production.

<doc id="991584" wikidata="Q2604396" url="?curid=991584" title="Witwatersrand Gold Rush">
<text>The Witwatersrand Gold Rush was a gold rush that began in 1886 and led to the establishment of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was a part of the Mineral Revolution.

==Origins==

In the modern-day province of Mpumalanga, gold miners in the alluvial mines of Barberton and Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest and local tribes had suspected the existence of gold deposits. In 1886, gold was found in the Witwatersrand region. Scientific studies show that the &quot;Golden Arc&quot;, which stretches from Johannesburg to Welkom, used to be a massive inland lake, and silt and gold deposits from alluvial gold settled in the area that formed the found gold.

==Discovery==

The first discovery of gold in the region was made in 1852 on the Pardekraal farm, Krugersdorp, in the South African Republic (ZAR) by John Henry Davis, a Welsh mineralogist. Davis presented his gold find to President Andries Pretorius who feared what would happen to the new republic if the discovery became widely known. Davis was told to sell the gold, worth £600, to the Transvaal Treasury and was subsequently ordered to leave the country and escorted to the border, where he returned to the Cape Colony.

Another find by Pieter Jacob Marais, who had dug gold in California, was recorded in 1853 on the Jukskei River but was subject to similar secrecy. He arrived at Potchefstroom on September 3, 1853. Marais explored the northern slopes of the Witwatersrand, a few kilometers from the future main reef, finding small gold samples while panning the Crocodile and Jukskei rivers and exploring the Suikerboschrand in the south during October and November 1853.On December 1, Marais sought approval from the Volksraad to look for gold, which was accepted with the provision that the Commission of the existing districts of the Republic would be notified if it was discovered. He was also warned that if he told any foreign power about any potential finds that caused a disturbance to the republic&#x27;s existence, he would be punished by death. Marais then paddled the Sand and Dwars rivers in January 1854. His small gold finds were exhibited at the courthouse in Potchefstroom in January 1854. After submitting his final report to the ZAR government on April 7, 1855, he left the ZAR in 1855 to settle in Dordrecht, Cape Colony.

In 1856, Lieutenant Lys travelled to Pretoria from Pietermaritzburg and became stuck crossing a marsh on the farm &quot;Driefontein&quot;, today&#x27;s Germiston, which would become the Knights Mine. On returning to his wagon, he discovered conglomerate rock that, when crushed, contained gold.

Though there were smaller mining operations in the region, it was not until 1884 and the subsequent 1886 discovery at Langlaagte that the Witwatersrand gold rush got underway in earnest.

Explorer and prospector Jan Gerrit Bantjes (1840-1914) was the first and original discoverer of a Witwatersrand gold reef in June 1884. He had prospected the area since the early 1880s, and operated the Kromdraai Gold Mine in 1883 in the NW of present-day Johannesburg with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar in an area known today as the &quot;Cradle of Humankind&quot;. However, he found minor reefs, and today the consensus falsely holds that credit for the discovery of the main gold reef is attributed to George Harrison, whose findings on the farm Langlaagte were made in July 1886, either through accident or systematic prospecting. This was a British attempt to give credit for the discovery to the Anglo-Saxon sector to justify claiming the Witwatersrand fields as British. This move was one of the factors leading to the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902. Harrison declared his claim with the then-government of the South African Republic (ZAR), and the area was pronounced open. His discovery was recorded with a monument where the original gold outcrop is believed to be located and a park named in his honor. Harrison is believed to have sold his claim for less than 10 pounds before leaving the area.

News of gold spread rapidly and reached Cecil Rhodes in Kimberley. Rhodes and his partner Robinson, with a team of companions, were curious and rode over 400 km to Bantjes&#x27; camp at Vogelstruisfontein, where they stayed with him for two nights near what would later become Roodepoort. Rhodes purchased the first batch of Witwatersrand gold from Bantjes for £3000. This purchase was the first transaction of the newly formed company, Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa.

News reached the rest of the world, and prospectors from Australia to California began arriving in masses, and settlers arrived in soon-to-be Johannesburg. The entrance of foreigners was going well, but a number of years later, President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic (ZAR) worried that foreigners would outnumber the Boers and put in place measures to stop this. Kruger discussed the measures with Bantjes, whose father, Jan Gerritze Bantjes, had educated Kruger when he was a boy during the Great Trek. One of the measures placed heavy taxes on the sale of dynamite to foreigners to slow the momentum. This agitated the miners, and the British took this as a reason to claim the gold fields for themselves. The Jameson Raid followed, which brought attention to Cecil Rhodes. The Jameson Raid was supported by Rhodes and led by Sir Leander Starr Jameson. Its intent was to overthrow the Transvaal government and turn the region into a British colony. There were 500 men who took part in the uprising; 21 were killed, and many were arrested, then trialed and sentenced.

==Founding of Johannesburg==
The mining village of Ferreira&#x27;s Camp was formalized into a settlement after people seeking gold settled in the area. Initially, the ZAR did not believe that the gold would last for long and mapped out a small triangular piece of land to cram as many plots onto as possible. This is the reason Johannesburg&#x27;s central business district streets are so narrow. There is a dispute as to the origin of the name Johannesburg and to whom Johannes, a common Dutch name, the city was named after. One theory is that it is named after two state surveyors who were sent to choose an area for the layout of the new town, Johann Rissik and Christiaan Johannes Joubert.

Within 10 years, the town was the largest in South Africa, growing faster than Cape Town, which was more than 200 years older. The gold rush saw massive development of Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand, and the area today is the prime metropolitan area of South Africa. One consequence of the gold rush was the construction of the first railway lines in this part of Africa. As a result of the rapid development of the goldfields on the Witwatersrand in the 1880s and the demand for coal by the growing industry, a concession was granted by the ZAR government to the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) on July 20, 1888, to construct a railway line from Johannesburg to Boksburg. The line was opened on March 17, 1890, with the first train being hauled by a 14 Tonner locomotive. It became known as the &quot;Randtram&quot;, even though it was a railway and not dedicated to tram traffic. This was the first working railway line in the Transvaal.

The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand also created a super-wealthy class of miners and industrialists known as Randlords. Many Randlords built large estates and mansions on the Parktown Ridge.

==Second Boer War==

The Witwatersrand Gold Rush had a significant role in both the failed Jameson Raid in 1895-1896 and the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. The British mine owners orchestrated the coup of the Boer government, which controlled the Witwatersrand, triggering the Second Boer War.

<doc id="991587" wikidata="Q805462" url="?curid=991587" title="Ballyshannon">
<text>Ballyshannon () is a town in County Donegal, Ireland. It is located at the southern end of the county where the N3 from Dublin ends and the N15 crosses the River Erne. Incorporated in 1613, it is one of the oldest towns in Ireland.

==Location==
Ballyshannon, which means &quot;the mouth of Seannach&#x27;s ford&quot;, after a fifth-century warrior, Seannach, who was slain there, lies at the mouth of the river Erne. Just west of the town, the Erne widens and its waters meander over a long sandy estuary. The northern bank of the river rises steeply away from the riverbank, while the southern bank is flat with a small cliff that runs parallel to the river. From its idyllic setting, the town looks out over the estuary and has panoramic views of mountains, lakes and forests.

==History==
Archaeological sites dating as far back as the Neolithic period (4000 BC – 2500 BC) have been excavated in Ballyshannon and surrounding areas, representing settlement and ritual activity from early periods of human settlement. Finds have ranged from &quot;fulachta fiadh&quot; (burnt mounds) dating from the Bronze Age (2500–500 BC), to a possible brushwood trackway thought to date to an earlier Neolithic period, through an early find of a pair of gold sun-discs from –2150 BCE to the recent discovery of a previously unknown medieval church and cemetery containing hundreds of skeletons thought to date from between 1100 and 1400. This site yielded numerous artefacts including silver long cross pennies and halfpennies dating from the reign of Henry III (1251–1276) and Edward I (–1302). Other finds included bone beads, shroud pins, and pieces of quartz which were found placed in the hands of many of the skeletons.

Numerous other sites from various periods are thought to exist, including a neolithic tomb, and the grave of Aed Ruad, High King of Ireland, upon which St. Anne&#x27;s church (Church of Ireland) was supposedly built, occupying the highest of the town&#x27;s vantage points—Mullgoose. Nothing remains to mark either tomb, the last vestige of the mound on Mullaghnashee having been obliterated in 1798 when a fort was constructed on the hill-top. The 18th-century churchyard and the paupers&#x27; burial ground were both referred to as &quot;Sidh Aedh Ruaidh&quot;, the Fairy Mound of Red Hugh. The &#x27;sheeman&#x27; (Anglicisation of the Irish &quot;sidh&quot;) in Mullgoose means &#x27;fairies&#x27;. Popular belief assigned the interior of hills to fairies&#x27; dwelling places and local tradition has handed down accounts of the exploits of the fairy folk, especially among the Finner sand-hills and in the Wardtown district of Ballyshannon. In 1906, the hill-top at Mullgoose was excavated and found to contain subterranean chambers.

The Vikings, according to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, attacked nearby Inishmurray Island in 795. Later they used the River Erne to attack inland, burning Devenish Island Monastery in 822. The Annals also record that in 836, all the churches of Loch Erne, together with Cluain Eois (Clones) and Daimhinis (Devenish Island) were destroyed by the &quot;gentiles&quot;. In 923 and 916 respectively, &quot;a fleet of foreigners on Loch Erne plundered the islands of the lake&quot;, as well as the surrounding territories.

In March 1613, Ballyshannon was incorporated as a borough by James I. In 1775 the salmon-leap of Assaroe at Ballyshannon was praised by the traveller Richard Twiss in &quot;A Tour in Ireland&quot;:
It was in Ballyshannon, around 1793, that Viscount Castlereagh, the future Chief Secretary for Ireland and, later, British Foreign Secretary, had his famous vision of the radiant boy. Known at the time as The Hon. Robert Stewart (he became Lord Castlereagh in 1796), he was serving as a young Army officer and MP for County Down in the Irish Parliament at the time. Lodging in the old Military Barracks in the town, Stewart (as he then was) retired for the night. Looking into the fire he saw the form of a boy emerge from the flames, grow larger and larger and vanish. The radiant boy is a well-known figure in English and Irish folklore, and is often supposed to foretell death. William Allingham later wrote a poem about the incident.

The Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway (E&amp;BR) opened in 1868 and had a station at Ballyshannon. The Great Northern Railway (GNR) operated the E&amp;BR line from 1876 and absorbed the company in 1896. The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Fermanagh into an international frontier. Henceforth Ballyshannon&#x27;s only railway link with the rest of the Irish Free State was &quot;via&quot; Northern Ireland, and as such was subject to delays for customs inspections. The Government of Northern Ireland closed much of the GNR network on its side of the border in 1957, including the E&amp;BR as far as the border. This gave the Republic no practical alternative but to allow the closure of the line through Ballyshannon between the border and Bundoran. Thereafter the nearest railheads for Ballyshannon were in the Republic and Omagh in Northern Ireland, until in 1965 the Ulster Transport Authority closed the line through Omagh as well.
A hydroelectric power station was built in the town in the 1950s. The project, or &#x27;Scheme&#x27; as it was then referred to, brought engineers, electricians, and specialists in hydroelectricity from many parts of the country and abroad to the town, which experienced a boom during the decade-long construction period. The scheme involved building a dam upriver from the town and digging out a deep channel or tailrace to lower the riverbed through the town to increase the head of water at the dam to drive the turbines. The new plant was named Cathaleen&#x27;s Fall hydroelectric power station. Before the station was built, the river was wide, and the water level much higher than it is today. A long bridge spanned from the northern shore to the &#x27;port&#x27; on the southern bank. The waters spilled over a number of waterfalls, among them Assaroe Falls, before meandering out to sea. Today, however, the river runs through a narrow channel, far below the level of either bank and a narrower single arch bridge has replaced the old one. The newly built Ballyshannon – Bundoran bypass has added a new, more modern bridge over the river. A pedestrian bridge was also constructed to mark the millennium.

During the Second World War the British and Irish governments quietly reached an agreement to create an air corridor between nearby Belleek and Ballyshannon, the &quot;Donegal Corridor&quot;, which was used by British Royal Air Force flights from Northern Ireland into the Atlantic Ocean. This was used by the aircraft which located the German battleship Bismarck.

<text>33 Dundas Street East is a studio complex located in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building was acquired by Rogers Media in 2007 as the new home of its four Toronto television stations: CITY-DT (Citytv), CFMT-DT (OMNI.1), CJMT-DT (OMNI.2) and CityNews 24/7. CITY-DT moved into the building on September 8, 2009, followed by the Omni stations a month later on October 19. First built in 2004, the building was home to Olympic Spirit Toronto, an Olympic-themed entertainment attraction, until 2006 and before that a three-storey Salvation Army building.
The building features three floors of television studio space for Citytv and Omni.

The building is located east of Yonge Street on Dundas Square, near the Toronto Eaton Centre and 10 Dundas East (formerly Toronto Life Square). It was previously known as 35 Dundas Street East, but the street number in the address was changed to 33 in 2009.

CITY-TV&#x27;s previous headquarters were located at 299 Queen Street West, which continues to serve the operations of most CHUM Limited&#x27;s former speciality channels, such as Much, CTV Life Channel, E!, and CTV Sci-Fi Channel, all of which now owned by Bell Media (previously CTVglobemedia). CFMT and CJMT were previously located at 545 Lake Shore Boulevard West, which continues to serve the operations of its Rogers-owned specialty channels such as OLN, The Biography Channel Canada and G4 Canada.

The Rogers Communications headquarters, where the company&#x27;s other radio stations remain as well as Sportsnet and Sportsnet One, are located at the Rogers Building at One Mount Pleasant Road.

In keeping with the layout of Dundas Square, 33 Dundas Street East is notable for its large billboard, usually used to advertise Citytv and OMNI&#x27;s programming, along with a Jumbotron-style TV screen which relays Citytv broadcast programming to those in the square below.

<text>Bagenalstown ( ), officially named Muine Bheag (), is a small town on the River Barrow in County Carlow, Ireland.

==History and name==
In the eight century, Saint Lappan reputedly founded a monastic school outside Bagenalstown in the townland of Donore. He is the patron saint of Bagenalstown.

The town grew within the townland of Moneybeg, from Irish &quot;Muine Bheag&quot; or &quot;Muinebheag&quot; (meaning &quot;small thicket&quot;). In the 18th century there was a small hamlet there. Walter Bagenal decided to build a town on the site, to be named &quot;New Versailles&quot; and modelled after Versailles in France. However, shortly after building began, the coach route from Dublin, which had passed the location, was changed so it crossed the River Barrow a few kilometres away, at Leighlinbridge, instead. Bagenal abandoned his plans, having built only a courthouse. It was not until the arrival of the railway in 1846 that the settlement began to grow into a town.

In 1911 the town became the first in Ireland to install dual-language street signs, which remain in place today. Following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the town commissioners chose to drop the English name &quot;Bagenalstown&quot; in favour of the Irish &quot;Muine Bheag&quot;. Several other places in Ireland were renamed around this time. The decision proved an ineffective one, and &quot;Bagenalstown&quot; remained in common use among locals. In a 1975 plebiscite, 77% of residents who voted opted to change the name back, but the proposal failed due to voter turnout of only around 50%, while the law required 75%.

The motto on the town&#x27;s coat of arms is &quot;The Irrepressible Number&quot; and its Irish equivalent &quot;Uimhir Gan Choisc&quot;.

=== Historic industry and town function ===
Bagenalstown&#x27;s history is strongly associated with the milling industry. Rudkin&#x27;s Mill marked the start of this industry. It was erected by Henry Rudkin between the end of the 17th century and the start of the 18th century. Shortly after the opening of Rudkin&#x27;s Mill another mill was opened by Owen Murphy; this would be more commonly known as Lodge Mills. 
In 1792 the Barrow Navigation Company began their plan to link the town and river to the Grand Canal. The construction of the canal allowed boats of up to 40 tonnes to transport goods directly to Dublin. In 1845, record numbers were recorded as 111,225 passengers and 286,601 tonnes of goods were transported along this route. Many of the boats that were used for transporting goods on this canal were owned by corn buyers and maltsters. This allowed them to efficiently transport the goods they needed direct from Rudkin&#x27;s Mill and Lodge Mill.

Bagenalstown very quickly transitioned into a highly prosperous town, and became recognised as a post, boat, mill and marketplace hub. The tradition of milling was also joined by salt and gas works in the 18th and 19th centuries. The canal route very quickly declined once the railway had been introduced and in 1852, only a small number of trading boats remained on this river. As of 2018, the canal was only used as a tourist attraction.

In 1982 a mile north of Bagenalstown a mechanical excavator was used to dig the foundations of a silo and struck a large granite boulder which proved to be a capstone of a cist burial dated from the Bronze Age.

==Transport==
Bagenalstown is at the junction of the R705 which leads to New Ross via Graiguenamanagh and Goresbridge and R724 R724 whics and lies on the eastern side of the R448 which links it to Carlow and the M9 to Dublin. Southbound the R448 leads to Paulstown, Gowran and the M9 leading to Waterford and Kilkenny.

The town is served by Muine Bheag railway station on the Dublin – Kilkenny section of the Dublin-Waterford railway line on the Iarnród Éireann network. This connects the town to nearby Carlow, as well as Kilkenny to the southwest. The station was opened on 24 July 1848 as Bagnalstown and was renamed Bagenalstown by April 1910. The station building was designed and constructed using limestone and granite and the design had been attributed to William Deane Butler. It was permanently closed to passengers on 30 March 1963 and for goods traffic on 6 September 1976. The station was reopened and officially renamed &quot;Muine Bheag&quot; in 1988 although Bagenalstown is recognised as its common name on the bilingual nameboards, in place since 2015, and on the Iarnród Éireann website. The station to this day remains largely untouched, with its original features still present.

The town is on the River Barrow which was made navigable from the Grand Canal upstream at Athy starting in 1792, all the way to Waterford downstream.

==Places of interest==

Near Bagenalstown is Ballyloughan Castle, which comprises a twin-towered gatehouse and the hall and foundations of one of the corner towers of a large castle dating from about 1300.

Ballymoon Castle is 3 km (2 mi) east of Bagenalstown, and is thought to date from the 13th century.

One of the best views of Bagenalstown can be seen from the Leighlinbridge road. This view includes the spire of St Andrews Catholic Church and the tower of St Marys Church of Ireland Church. St Andrews church was built in the 1820s on a site provided by the Newton family, successors of the Bagenals.

==Community groups==
The 1st Bagenalstown BP Scout Group was set up in 2009 and meets in the McGrath hall. Their activities include hiking, camping, kayaking and games.

Bagenalstown hosts a floral festival every August.

==Sport==
Bagenalstown has had a long tradition in cricket. The Bagenalstown Cricket Club was first formed in 1843 by the local millers, and is still in use. The club&#x27;s logo is a grinding wheel, which was used in early milling. Muine Bheag is the local GAA club, formed in 2018 after the amalgamation of three former clubs.

There is a river-side outdoor swimming pool on the approach road to the town from Leighlinbridge. The McGrath complex offers sporting facilities such as hurling, cricket, soccer and Gaelic football fields, tennis courts, and pitch-and-putt courses.

The racehorse Danoli, described in 1995 as &quot;the most popular racehorse in Ireland&quot; was trained near the town by Thomas Foley.

==Education==
Bagenalstown has three primary schools and two secondary schools:
*Queen of the Universe National School, founded by Bishop Keogh in 1957, is a primary school for boys (junior infants to 1st class) and girls.
*St Brigid&#x27;s National School, founded in 1865, is a primary school for boys only from classes 2nd to 6th.
*St Mary&#x27;s National School is a co-educational school under Church of Ireland patronage.
*Presentation De La Salle College is a secondary school, established in 1983. This Catholic College is under the trusteeship of the De La Salle Brothers, the Presentation Sisters and Bagenalstown Parish.
*Muine Bheag Vocational School is a secondary school, opened in 1963.

==International relations==

The town was twinned with the town of Pont-Péan, Brittany in 1999. The twinning charter, which is written in Irish, English and French, commits the two towns to &quot;developing social, economic, cultural, touristic, and sporting links&quot; between the two communities.

<text>Bundoran () is a town in County Donegal, Ireland. The town is located near the N15 road near Ballyshannon, and is the most southerly town in Donegal. The town is a tourist seaside resort, and tourism has been at the heart of the local economy since the 18th century. Bundoran is a surfing destination and was listed by &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in 2012 as one of the world&#x27;s top 20 surf towns.

==History==
===Origins===
Bundoran, or &quot;Bun Dobhráin&quot; in Irish (which means the foot of the little water) was, up until over a century ago, two separate villages. Bundoran was the village &quot;west&quot; of the bridge over the River Bradoge. This area is now called &quot;the West End&quot;. East of the bridge, about away, was the village of Single Street. In between these two separate communities was the townland of Drumacrin. The area of Drumacrin is now part of what is today&#x27;s town centre. Single Street was where most of the local population lived. It was only after completion of the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway in 1868, which opened a terminus that it called &quot;Bundoran&quot;, that the two distinct communities developed and merged to what are today called Bundoran.

The first official record of Bundoran is in a deposition by Hugh Gaskein on 16 May 1653. He was a witness to events during the 1641 Rebellion when he was an apprentice butcher in Sligo. In 1689 a skirmish was fought near Bundoran between a Jacobite force under Sir Connell Ferrall and the retreating Protestant garrison of Sligo.

William Cole, Viscount Enniskillen, built Bundoran Lodge, his summer home, in 1777. This building still stands on Bayview Avenue and is now called Homefield House. The Viscount seems to have started a trend amongst his contemporaries as more of them discovered Bundoran and visited it to enjoy the seaside and what were believed to be its health benefits.

===Public rights of way===
The rights of the people to have access to the seashore were blocked by a local landlord but the locals found a champion in the parish priest Canon Kelaghan who fought through the courts in 1870 to ensure that the pathways and roads to the beach remained open to the public. Canon Kelaghan also had the present Catholic church built in 1859.

===The railway===
The opening of the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway (E&amp;BR) in 1868 connected Bundoran railway station with Ireland&#x27;s growing railway network and made the town more accessible from Belfast, Dublin and other population centres on the east and north-east coasts of Ireland. The Great Northern Railway (GNR) operated the E&amp;BR line from 1876 and absorbed the company in 1896.

In this period Bundoran emerged as one of Ireland&#x27;s most popular seaside resorts. By the end of the 19th century it had become one of the main seaside resorts in Ulster. Hotels and lodging houses were opened around the town and the GNR built the Great Northern Hotel, one of Bundoran&#x27;s best-known landmarks.

During The Emergency of 1939–45 the GNR introduced the &quot;Bundoran Express&quot; that linked Dublin and Bundoran via and Enniskillen. It also carried pilgrims to and from Pettigo, which was the nearest station for Lough Derg in County Donegal. There were also through trains between Bundoran and Belfast.

The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Fermanagh into an international frontier. Henceforth Bundoran&#x27;s only railway link with the rest of the Irish Free State was &quot;via&quot; Northern Ireland, and as such was subject to delays for customs inspections. The Government of Northern Ireland closed much of the GNR network on its side of the border in 1957, including the E&amp;BR as far as the border. This gave the Republic no practical alternative but to allow the closure of the line between the border and Bundoran. Thereafter the nearest railheads for Bundoran were in the Republic and Omagh in Northern Ireland, until in 1965 the Ulster Transport Authority closed the line through Omagh as well.

Today, the closest railway stations to Bundoran are Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town and Waterside Station in Derry.

===Central Hotel fire===

On 8 August 1980, a fire broke out at The Central Hotel in the heart of the town. Ten people died as a result, including five children. In September 2008, the Church reinstalled a stained glass window made by the world-renowned Harry Clarke (1889–1931), a window which for many years was lying hidden in the parish house of the local Catholic church. The council also erected a carved stone monument bench on Central Lane (beside The Central Hotel) in August 2010 as a mark of respect listing the names of the ten people who lost their lives.

==Attractions==
===Bundoran beach===

For almost two centuries people have visited Bundoran beach on hot summer days. The tradition of bathing boxes began in Victorian times. They were primarily used by members of the gentry, who were reticent about undressing in public. The boxes were pushed, on wheels, to the water&#x27;s edge and the customer entered the box through one door, put on their bathing costume and stepped out another door to enter the sea. The box remained there until the bather was finished, dried off and fully clothed again. The bathing box was brought back to its original position on the beach, ready for the next client.

Stationary bathing boxes were introduced in the early 1900s. They proved more amenable and cheaper to the public. In the 1920s, Mrs Elizabeth Travers and her brother-in-law, Bilshie Travers hired the boxes from the local Council. For 3 old pennies a customer hired a bathing costume and for 6 old pennies, they could hire &quot;the whole package&quot; which consisted of a bathing cap, costume and towel. A familiar sight on the beach in the 1950s and 1960s was &quot;The Duck&quot;. This was a former British Army amphibious craft that ferried tourists out onto the Bay. Despite being prone to breakdown, it was an attraction at the time.

The Main Beach in Bundoran has been awarded a Blue Flag for each year of the existence of the competition, bar 2019.

===Coastal walks===
The Promenade to Tullan Strand Starting at Bundoran Bridge and looking out towards the sea is Cladach Leathan (the broad beach) on which lies Bill Ireland&#x27;s Stone, named after the rescue of a shipwrecked sailor. Beyond it is the surf break of The Peak. At the end of the Promenade is Carraig na nÉan (the rock of the birds). The pump house that overlooks the bay was built by local landlords the Hamiltons in 1861. Close by is Carraig a Choiscéim (the rock of the step). Next to it is Poll Uain (Lambs&#x27; Hole) which is also known as the Horse Pool. The Thrupenny Pool was named after the price of admission (3d. in pre-decimal currency). The main beach is called Trá na Draina (the strand of the strong) where according to legend the giant Culina wrestled with his son, both unaware of each other&#x27;s identity. The small stream that enters the sea on the beach is Sruthán na Cúil Fhinne (the rivulet of the fair girl). The coral and brachiopod fossils embedded in the rocks of Rougey are over 300 million years old. At the tip of Rougey is Aughrus (the peninsula of the steeds), where the warhorses of Conall Gulbán and the O‘Donnells grazed. Passing by the golf links is Pól Uaine and Pól Tóbí, both fishing spots. Next is the ‘Puffing Hole’. Below is Tullan Strand, where the first inhabitants of the area used flint from the rocks to make tools.

===Fairy bridges &amp; wishing chair===
The Fairy Bridges and Wishing Chair are located on the Roguey Walk near Tullan Strand in the town. This natural sea arch bridge was said to be Bundoran&#x27;s first tourism attraction when the town became popular in the late 1700s. It features in a painting by artist Helen Allingham and in 2020 won a TripAdvisor Travellers Choice award placing it in the top 10 attractions on the review site across the globe.

===Waterworld===
The Waterworld complex opened in 1991 with its development coming about as a result of major storm damage in 1988 along the seafront. The indoor water park includes a wave pool, rapids, slides that were added in 1994 with the addition of an external tower, and a three-lane multi-slide and toddler pool which were added in 2013 as a result of a multi-million euro investment by its owners Donegal County Council.

===Adventure World===
Adventure World, near Waterworld, includes waltzing horses, water zorbing and water bumper cars, for younger families. A big wheel is used in Galway&#x27;s Christmas market, where it is located outside the Great Southern Hotel.

===Amusement arcades===
Macks amusements are owned by a son of Sean McEniff. There are several hundred gaming machines and several dozen amusement machines. At its entrance is a large statue of Neptune.

===Hotels, hostels, caravans and campsites===
Bundoran has many hotels, among the biggest are The Allingham Arms (132 rooms), The Great Northern (102) and The Holyrood (91). Fitzgerald&#x27;s Hotel, with 16 rooms, is the town&#x27;s smallest and first opened in 1941, retaining an atmosphere from the past. As well as hotels, a 2018 report recorded sixteen caravan sites and campsites (consisting of 4,312 beds), several hundred self-catering residences and nine hostels.

===Brennan&#x27;s Criterion Bar===

Brennan&#x27;s Criterion Bar opened in the area in 1900 and shut down in 2018.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The opening in April 2006 of the Bundoran/Ballyshannon bypass has made the resort more accessible. Sligo is south from Bundoran along the scenic Atlantic coast. The Drowes River, where the southern part of the bypass commences and which separates County Leitrim from County Donegal, is also the demarcation point between the provinces of Connacht to the south and Ulster to the north.

===Rail===
Bundoran railway station opened on 13 June 1866 but finally closed on 1 October 1957. The New Council Offices carpark is where the Bundoran Railway Station once stood.

The nearest railway station today is Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town, where trains run to Dublin Connolly and are operated by Iarnród Éireann. Buses from Bundoran to Sligo stop at Sligo bus station which is adjacent to Sligo Mac Diarmada Station.

===Coach/bus transport===
Bus Éireann buses connect Bundoran to Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town. Bus Éireann also run a regular service, several times a day, from Derry to Galway, via Letterkenny and Bundoran. Feda O&#x27;Donnell (Bus Feda) runs from Crolly to Galway via Gweedore, Letterkenny, Donegal Town, Ballyshannon and Bundoran to the west of Ireland, including Sligo and Galway, with an additional service to Limerick during the college term. There is also an Ulsterbus service (194/195) from Bundoran to Enniskillen.

There are two Local Link buses services: 982 Ballyshannon to Sligo and 983 Kinlough to Ballyshannon.

There are a number of bus stops in the town, though the main ones are the East bus stop and West bus stop. Feda O&#x27;Donnell and Local Link both stop at the Tourist Office.

==Developments==
Development in Bundoran has been triggered by its popularity as a seaside destination and the availability of tax reliefs for the development of holiday homes in the past. Thousands of music fans attend the Bundoran Sea Sessions Surf and Music Festival every June.

The Astoria Ballroom was built in 1953 at a time when dances were a major social activity, and showbands would entertain large crowds at the venue. In 1990, Meatloaf also played at the ballroom. In November 2008, it was destroyed by fire. In 2024, conditional planning permission was given for construction of a funfair and waterpark on the former site of the ballroom.

In 2019 the town was announced as Failte Ireland&#x27;s Destination Town for county Donegal paving the way for investment of €500,000 from the tourism development authority to enhance the town.

==Education==
On Railway Road stands the St Louis Convent School, which was built in 1892. The buildings included a School and residence for the Sisters of St Louis. One of the buildings still stands today. In 1958, the Sisters of St Louis moved their Monaghan school, St. Martha&#x27;s Industrial School, to Bundoran on a site beside the Old Grand Central Cinema in the premises known as The Sea View Hotel. The school closed in 1966. After its closure, St. Martha&#x27;s was accused of child abuse and in June 2002 legal action was brought against it by numerous former pupils. One account in 1963 was where some girls had run away from the school and had their hair cropped when they returned. An investigation at the time resulted in two nuns being removed.

The St Joseph&#x27;s orphanages were erected from funds bequeathed by the late Miss Sarah Crudden, Newtownbutler. In August 1957, St Joseph&#x27;s was closed and transferred to St Louis under the name &quot;St. Martha&#x27;s&quot;. These buildings later became known as Ard Lughaidh Secondary School, much of the building was stone and also had a large sports and theatre hall all of which in 2006 the VEC demolished them. All that is left on the lands is the extension area used till the 1980s by &#x27;live in&#x27; students of the Ard Lughaidh. This is now under the Donegal Adventure Centre ownership. Due to the decreasing class sizes in Ard Lughaigh in the 1990s the school faced closure and some students moved to Ballyshannon. Some of the St. Louis nuns moved to the St. Louis building at Railway Road, however, a lot moved away.

==Sport==

===Surfing===
Bundoran is noted as a surfing location and known as the Surf Capital of Ireland. Surfing locations include The Peak, Tullan Strand and nearby Rossnowlagh beach. The town hosted the European Surfing Championships in 1985 and again in 2011 and has been consistently named as the top beginner beach in Ireland by Red Bull Surf breaks in the town are suitable for beginners, intermediate and professionals.

===Golf===
There is an 18-hole golf course in Bundoran. The golf club was founded in 1894. The course is located on the historic Great Northern Railway Company site, the old railway sleepers encompass the Golf course which enjoys the most breathtaking and scenic views of the Atlantic Ocean. The course is a challenging experience despite its short length. Designed by Harry Vardon, the golf course is a testing 18 hole, Par 70. His design philosophy was “to give pleasure to golfers of all degrees”.

===Gaelic games===

In the 1920s the location of Bundoran on the railway line made the Bundoran local ground a convenient venue for many big games. The GAA club grounds were purchased in 1938. The club was reorganised and renamed Réalt na Mara, meaning &quot;The Star of the Sea&quot;. The football park has undergone many developments throughout the years. The ground was levelled in 1947 and enclosed in 1951. The club changing rooms were constructed in 1972.

The juniors were successful in both the 1956 and 1960 Championships. In 1963, Réalt na Mara joined with Ballyshannon club Aodh Ruadh to become St Joseph&#x27;s. That team included many players that contributed to the Donegal county team, including Brian McEniff and the former Donegal County Council Manager Michael McLoone. In 1977 the club was again divided into two clubs, one each for the towns of Bundoran and Ballyshannon.

In 1979, Bundoran beat Ballybofey in a nail-biting one-point victory to win the Senior Championship. Local man Brian McEniff led Donegal to the 1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, in which they defeated Dublin in the final 0–18 to 0–14. Bundoran was the scene of enormous celebrations for almost a month afterwards.

In 2015, Réalt Na Mara won the Donegal Intermediate Football Championship title and went on to reach the Ulster final where they were defeated by Loughinisland.

===Greyhound racing===
A greyhound racing track was opened by the Bundoran Greyhound Racing Company Ltd in the town during October 1931. The construction cost was £800 in £1 shares and was set up by James Cassidy (cattle dealer) and John Conlan (merchant). The directors also included J.T.Flavin, D.Judge, P.Gorman and W.Hudson. On 21 December 1934 notice had been given that after three months the company would be dissolved but there is evidence that the track was still active or had re-opened during 1948.

==Bundoran in popular culture==
The song &quot;Beautiful Bundoran&quot; was written by Mai O&#x27;Higgins from Dungarvan, Waterford with the melody written by Bertie Flynn. It is believed that Mai had never actually been to Bundoran and had written the song from a brochure of Donegal. It has been covered by several artists most notably Kathleen Fitzgerald and the Fitzgerald Ceili Band, Jim Finnegan and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor for the film &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;.

<text>Manius Tullius Longus ( 500 BC) was consul at Rome in 500 BC, with Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus.

Livius reports that no important events occurred during this year and has Longus incorrectly named as Marcus Manlius Tullus. Dionysius instead states that a conspiracy to restore the Tarquins to power was detected and crushed by Camerinus while war was fought against the Fidenae. Dionysius also has Longus dying during the Ludi Romani, leaving his colleague as sole consul.

An alternate narrative is provided by Festus in conjecture with Valerius Maximus who numbers Tullius among several men who were burned publicly near the Circus Maximus in 486 BC for conspiring with the consul Spurius Cassius Vecellinus.

<text>In computer storage, a tape library is a physical area that holds magnetic data tapes. In an earlier era, tape libraries were maintained by people known as tape librarians and computer operators and the proper operation of the library was crucial to the running of batch processing jobs. Although tape libraries of this era were not automated, the use of tape management system software could assist in running them.

Subsequently, tape libraries became physically automated, and as such are sometimes called a tape silo, tape robot, or tape jukebox. These are a storage devices that contain one or more tape drives, a number of slots to hold tape cartridges, a barcode reader to identify tape cartridges, and an automated method for loading tapes (a robot). Such solutions are mostly used for backups and for digital archiving. Additionally, the area where tapes that are not currently in a silo are stored is also called a tape library. One of the earliest examples was the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System (MSS), announced in 1974. 

In either era, tape libraries can contain millions of tapes.

== Manual era ==
=== Tapes and batch processing ===
In the mainframe computer era, especially the IBM mainframe, the most common format in use was the 9-track tape.
Some large application systems could require scores of different tapes as part of their batch job runs.

In the data processing applications of the era, the master files for such things as employee payroll information, supplies and stores inventory, or customer accounts were typically kept on tape. Batch jobs to update these master files would take the existing tape master file as input and write out a new tape master file as output. In addition, the set of update transactions themselves might constitute a second input tape. The master file output of one update job would then be the master file input to the next time the job is run, perhaps a day, a week, or a month later. The tapes representing a few past iterations of a master file would typically be retained, in case a problem with the latest version were to be discovered and the job had to be rerun.

=== Role of tape libraries and librarians ===
Mainframe computer installations often had a separate room, the tape library, to house their racks and cabinets of tapes. The typical workflow for running a batch job was to go into the library, pull certain tapes off the racks there and load them onto a rolling cart, move the cart into the computer area, mount the tapes onto tape drives for a production run, take the tapes off the drives when the run was over, move the cart back to the library, and put the tapes back on the library racks. Such tape libraries existed at most computer installations.

Even a modestly sized computer installation could have hundreds of tapes,
and library sizes of several thousand reels of tapes were commonplace. 
And they could be much larger: by the mid-1970s, the U.S. Census Bureau and NASA each had tape libraries with around one million tape reels in them.
The person in charge of all this was typically called the tape librarian. 

In this era, there were no automated tape delivery and mounting systems, and so this action had to be done by computer operators.
These people were the ones responsible for mounting tapes onto tape drives as part of running a job.
Even careful computer operators could sometimes mount the wrong tape as input to a job or present the reels of a multi-tape dataset out of order. Overwriting a tape that was meant to be preserved was another potential mistake.

It was the tape librarian&#x27;s responsibility to set up procedures for the handling of tapes to minimize the chances of errors taking place.
As one book of the era wrote, &quot;keeping track of the whereabouts of the tapes is a formidable and responsible job.&quot;

=== Supporting software ===
Tape management systems of this era were software packages whose purpose was to help facilitate tape library operations and management. They kept track of data sets on tape, and produced reports indicating whether a data set should be retained on, or could be scratched from, a tape; they aided in the setup and running of scheduled production jobs, through such things as tape pull lists and pre-printed external gummed tape labels; and they kept track of the physical inventory of tape reels. The most popular of these packages was UCC-1 from University Computing Company, a product that was also known as the Tape Management System. It made several appearances on Datapro Research Corporation&#x27;s Software Honor Roll. Another was Valu-Lib from Value Computing, Inc.,
and a third was TLMS II from Capex Corporation.

As use of the mainframe continued on into the following century, tape library management, both manual and automatic, was one element of the offerings of the Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (MVS) from IBM.

== Automated era ==

=== Design ===

Physically automated tape library devices can store immense amounts of data, ranging from 20 terabytes up to 2.1 exabytes of data as of 2016. Such capacity is multiple thousand times that of a typical hard drive and well in excess of what is capable with network attached storage. Typical entry-level solutions cost around $10,000 USD, while high-end solutions can start at as much as $200,000 USD and cost well in excess of $1 million for a fully expanded and configured library.

For large data-storage, they are a cost-effective solution, with cost per gigabyte as low as 2 cents USD. The tradeoff for their larger capacity is their slower access time, which usually involves mechanical manipulation of tapes. Access to data in a library takes from several seconds to several minutes.

Because of their slow sequential access and huge capacity, tape libraries are primarily used for backups and as the final stage of digital archiving. A typical application of the latter would be an organization&#x27;s extensive transaction record for legal or auditing purposes. Another example is hierarchical storage management (HSM), in which tape library is used to hold rarely used files from file systems.

=== Software support ===

There are several large-scale library-management packages available commercially. Open-source implementations include AMANDA, Bacula, and the minimal mtx program.

=== Barcode labels ===

Tape libraries commonly have the capability of optically scanning barcode labels which are attached to each tape, allowing them to automatically maintain an inventory of which tapes are where within the library. Preprinted barcode labels are commercially available or custom labels may be generated using commercial or free software. The barcode label is frequently part of the tape label, information recorded at the beginning of the medium to uniquely identify the tape.

=== Autoloaders ===
Smaller tape libraries with only one drive are known as autoloaders. The term &quot;autoloader&quot; is also sometimes used synonymously with &quot;stacker&quot;, a device in which the media are loaded necessarily in a sequential manner.

Other types of autoloaders may operate with optical discs (such as compact discs or DVDs) or floppy disks.

<text>Marcus Tullius Decula was a consul of the Roman Republic in 81 BC alongside Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella, during the dictatorship of Sulla; but the consuls of that year were only nominal, as Sulla had all the power in his hands.

<text>Bobby Schayer (born December 23, 1966, in Los Angeles, California) is an American drummer. He was a member of Bad Religion from 1991 to 2001. Schayer is from Encino, a suburb in the San Fernando Valley. He started drumming in 1976 at the age of 10, but it was not until 1980 that he became a student of original Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer.

Schayer has cited Tommy Ramone, Paul Cook, Clem Burke, Mick Tucker, Bun E. Carlos, Charlie Watts, and Keith Moon as some of his earliest drumming influences. He officially joined Bad Religion on April 1, 1991, after previous drummer, Pete Finestone, left the band after their fifth LP, &quot;Against the Grain&quot;. He was present on their sixth LP, &quot;Generator&quot;, in 1992. He also played drums on &quot;Recipe For Hate&quot; (1993), &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;The Gray Race&quot; (1996), &quot;Tested&quot; (1997), &quot;No Substance&quot; (1998), and &quot;The New America&quot; in 2000. In 2001, he suffered an injury to his shoulder, and deciding to venture in a new direction, left Bad Religion. Schayer was replaced by Brooks Wackerman, formerly of Infectious Grooves and Suicidal Tendencies.

For over ten years from 2001 to 2011, Schayer was the drum tech for Sam Fogarino of the band Interpol.

Schayer currently lives in Los Angeles, CA.

<doc id="991622" wikidata="Q3053689" url="?curid=991622" title="Tiffin">
<text>Tiffin is a South Asian English word for a type of meal. It refers to a light breakfast or a light tea-time meal at about 3 p.m., consisting of typical tea-time foods. In certain parts of India, it can also refer to the midday luncheon or, in some regions of the Indian subcontinent, a between-meal snack. When used in place of the word &quot;lunch&quot;, however, it does not necessarily mean a light meal.

==Etymology==
In the British Raj, tiffin was used to denote the British custom of afternoon tea that had been supplanted by the Indian practice of having a light meal at that hour. It is derived from &quot;tiffing&quot;, an English colloquial term meaning to take a little drink. By 1867 it had become naturalised among Anglo-Indians in northern British India to mean luncheon.

==Current usage==

In South India and in Nepal, tiffin is generally a snack between meals: dosas, idlis, vadas etc. In other parts of India, such as Mumbai, the word mostly refers to a packed lunch of some sort. In Mumbai, it is often delivered to them by dabbawalas, sometimes known as &quot;tiffin wallahs&quot;, who use a complex system to get thousands of tiffin carriers to their destinations. In most of India, a school-going child&#x27;s lunch box is fondly called a tiffin box. It is also used heavily in Pakistan where people use tiffin boxes in places like offices, schools or during picnic. This practice is also common in India.

When used in place of the word &quot;lunch&quot;, tiffin often consists of rice, lentils, curry, vegetables, chapatis or &quot;spicy meats&quot;. In addition, the lunch boxes are themselves called tiffin carriers, tiffin-boxes or just tiffins.

<doc id="991623" wikidata="Q1028344" url="?curid=991623" title="Cambridge Platonists">
<text>The Cambridge Platonists were an influential group of Platonist philosophers and Christian theologians at the University of Cambridge that existed during the 17th century. The leading figures were Ralph Cudworth and Henry More.

== Group and its name ==
Mark Goldie, writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, notes that the term &quot;Cambridge Platonists&quot; was given in the 19th century and can be misleading. There is no clear distinction between the group and latitudinarians in general.

===Historiography===
The categorization and interpretation of the Cambridge Platonists has changed over time. Frances Yates interpreted them as scholars who engaged with the Christian Kabbalah but rejected Hermeticism following Isaac Casaubon&#x27;s redating of the Hermetic corpus. She argues that Cudworth and More perpetuate certain Renaissance Neoplatonic ideas, including a broad syncretism of early forms of Hermeticism, in a new scholarly context.

Dmitri Levitin has challenged any categorization of the Cambridge Platonists as a cohesive philosophical group. While he admits that the group &quot;existed as a loose set of acquaintances linked by tutorial relationships,&quot; he argues that they were not exclusive in their interest in Platonism, nor did most of them believe in any syncretism or a &quot;prisca theologia&quot;/&quot;philosophia perennis&quot;. Levitin notes that of the Cambridge Platonists, only More saw himself as a philosopher rather than a philologist or theologian and he faced criticism from others, including Cudworth, for his lack of attention to historical detail. Moreover, philosophers not traditionally deemed &quot;Cambridge Platonists&quot; took an historical and philosophical interest in Platonism and ideas of ancient science. Based on these conclusions Levitin rejects any categorization of the Cambridge Platonists as a cohesive group in terms of philosophical views as historically unfounded.

More recently, David Leech has argued that while Levitin makes some important points &quot;it would be a mistake to assume that the category of Cambridge Platonism is a retroprojection of nineteenth century historiography. This is because earlier practices of referring to a group of primarily Cambridge-based &#x27;Platonists&#x27;, invariably including Ralph Cudworth (1617–1688) and Henry More (1614–1687), usually Benjamin Whichcote (1609–1683), and (more variably) a number of other key figures, can be traced back at least to the 1730s in continental Europe, and still earlier in English texts.&quot;

==Views==
The Cambridge Platonists used the framework of the &quot;philosophia perennis&quot; of Agostino Steuco, and from it argued for moderation. They believed that reason is the proper judge of disagreements, and so they advocated dialogue between the Puritan and Laudian traditions. The orthodox English Calvinists of the time found in their views an insidious attack, by-passing as it did the basic theological issues of atonement and justification by faith. Given the circle&#x27;s Cambridge background in Puritan colleges such as Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, the undermining was intellectually all the more effective. John Bunyan complained in those terms about Edward Fowler, a close latitudinarian follower.

Their understanding of reason was as &quot;the candle of the Lord&quot;, an echo of the divine within the human soul and an &quot;imprint&quot; of God within man. They believed that reason could judge the private revelations of Puritan narrative, and investigate contested rituals and liturgy of the Church of England. For this approach they were called &quot;latitudinarian&quot;.

The dogmatism of the Puritan divines, with their anti-rationalist demands, was, they felt, incorrect. They also felt that the Calvinist insistence on individual revelation left God uninvolved with the majority of mankind. At the same time, they were reacting against the reductive materialist writings of Thomas Hobbes. They felt that the latter, while rationalist, were denying the idealistic part of the universe.

To the Cambridge Platonists, religion and reason were in harmony, and reality was known not by physical sensation alone, but by intuition of the intelligible forms that exist behind the material world of everyday perception. Universal, ideal forms inform matter, and the physical senses are unreliable guides to their reality. In response to the mechanical philosophy, More proposed a &quot;Hylarchic Principle&quot;, and Cudworth a concept of &quot;Plastic Nature&quot;.

* Peter Sterry (1613–1672)
* George Rust (d.1670)
* Henry More (1614–1687)

* John Norris (1657–1711)

Though coming later and not generally considered a Cambridge Platonist himself, Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury (1671–1713) was much influenced by the movement.

== Major works ==
* Benjamin Whichcote (1609–1683) was one of the leaders of the movement, but he was also an active pastor and academic who did not publish in his lifetime. His sermons were notable and caused controversies, and Whichcote wrote a great deal without publishing. In 1685, &quot;Some Select Notions of B. Whichcote&quot; was published due to demand. After that was &quot;Select Sermons&quot; (1689) (with a preface by Shaftesbury) and &quot;Several Discourses&quot; (1701). Finally, a collection of his sayings appeared as &quot;Moral and Religious Aphorisms&quot; in 1703.
* Peter Sterry is remembered for his &quot;A Discourse of the Freedom of the Will&quot; (1675) among other works. 
* Henry More (1614–1687) wrote many works. As a Platonist, his important works were &quot;Manual of Ethics&quot; (1666), the &quot;Divine Dialogues&quot; (1668), and the &quot;Manual of Metaphysics&quot; (1671). While all of More&#x27;s works enjoyed popularity, the &quot;Divine Dialogues&quot; were perhaps most influential.
* Cudworth&#x27;s chief philosophical work was &quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; (1678) and the &quot;Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality&quot;, which appeared posthumously in 1731.
* John Smith, a student of Benjamin Whichcote, is best remembered for the elegance of his style and the depth of his learning in the posthumously published &quot;Select Discourses&quot; (1660). Smith draws extensively from Plotinus to support his Christian Platonism. 
* Culverwell&#x27;s chief work was &quot;Light of Nature&quot; (1652). Culverwell died young (probably at the age of 32). He had intended to write a multi-part work reconciling the Gospel with philosophical reason.

<text>Giuliano da Sangallo (c. 1445 – 1516) was an Italian sculptor, architect and military engineer active during the Italian Renaissance. He is known primarily for being the favored architect of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, his patron. In this role, Giuliano designed a villa for Lorenzo as well as a monastery for Augustinians and a church where a miracle was said to have taken place. Additionally, Giuliano was commissioned to build multiple structures for Pope Julius II and Pope Leo X. Leon Battista Alberti and Filippo Brunelleschi heavily influenced Sangallo and in turn, he influenced other important Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, his brother Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, and his sons, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Francesco da Sangallo.

== Early life ==
Giuliano da Sangallo (né Giuliano Giamberti) was born c. 1445 in Florence. His father, Francesco Giamberti, was a woodworker and an architect who worked closely with Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. This proved to be helpful to Giuliano and his brother, Antonio, later in life as it helped them to develop a close working relationship and friendship with Cosimo&#x27;s grandson, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. As a child, Giuliano became an apprentice to a joiner. As an apprentice, his woodworking, building and sculpting skills drew the attention of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. In addition to his work as a joiner&#x27;s apprentice, Giuliano had the opportunity to study the works of ancient architects as well as his more immediate predecessors such as Leon Battista Alberti and Filippo Brunelleschi. Through this, he was able to develop his creative eye, learn about classical design, and also develop what became a lifelong business relationship with Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Giuliano&#x27;s first major, independent commission came from the Medici family and it showed not only his architectural skill, but also his knowledge of defensive fortifications. Lorenzo the Magnificent called upon Giuliano to build military fortifications and manage the artillery in the town of Castellina against an invasion led by the Duke of Calabria. In this role, Giuliano successfully pushed out the Calabrian forces and showed his natural talent for military building and strategy.

== Major works ==

=== Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano ===

The victory at Calabria gave Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici confidence to keep working with Giuliano. Consequently, Lorenzo commissioned him to design a villa in Poggio a Caiano after holding a competition to determine the best design. Construction on the villa began in 1485 and remained largely unfinished throughout Lorenzo&#x27;s life. His son, Giovanni, oversaw its completion after being elected pope as Pope Leo X. Giuliano&#x27;s design featured classical design elements including Ionic columns and an ancient temple style façade. The Medici Villa in Poggia a Caiano is one of the oldest examples of Renaissance-style country villas and served as an inspiration for many future architects of the era.

=== Santa Maria delle Carceri ===

In 1484, a child from the town of Prato claimed to have seen a painting of the Virgin Mary and an infant Jesus come to life on the side of the public jail. Santa Maria delle Carceri was commissioned after the townspeople declared this a miracle and decided that a church should be built at the site of the vision to commemorate it. For this project, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici once again hired his favorite architect, Giuliano. His designs relied heavily on his study of the work of Alberti and Brunelleschi. Specifically, Sangallo used a Greek cross plan. This is a classical layout design that features four arms of equal length extending off of a central nave and it had not been used extensively in the Renaissance before that point. Construction began on the church in 1486, but the façade remains unfinished to this day.

=== Reggia in Naples ===
In 1488, after the initial plans were set for the villa in Poggia a Caiano, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici commissioned Giuliano to build a castle for Ferrante of Aragon, the King of Naples. The building of the castle was part of a larger political plan that the leaders of the different city-states of Renaissance Italy engaged in. When city-states were not warring with each other, they would send gifts as well as painters, sculptors, and architects to each other as diplomatic displays of good faith. Additionally, by sending Giuliano to Naples, the Medici family was attempting to export Florentine culture and architecture across the Italian Peninsula. Giuliano sought to build the castle near the open land by Castel Nuovo. Unfortunately, the castle was never built, but his sketches of the plan still remain. The palace design featured elements similar to that of Giuliano&#x27;s first major commission, the Medici Villa. Similar elements between the Medici Villa and the castle in Naples include the raised platform on which the structures were built, two stairways leading to the main entrance, and a portico between the two stairways. Furthermore, both structures were built on a rectangular, symmetrical axis. After Giuliano completed his service for the king, he was sent back to Florence with gifts including money, paintings, and sculptures. Giuliano gave many of these gifts to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici as a showing of appreciation for being his patron.
While Sangallo was designing the palace for the King of Naples, the King&#x27;s son, the Duke of Calabria, wrote to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici asking for a palace design as well. In response to this letter, Lorenzo sent another Giuliano, Giuliano da Maiano, to design his palace. Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author who wrote biographies of many Renaissance artists in &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, falsely attributes the Duke of Calabria&#x27;s palace to Giuliano da Sangallo. Also according to Vasari, after working in Naples, the Bishop of Ostia, later known as Pope Julius II, hired Giuliano to re-fortify his castle in Ostia. It is true that Sangallo worked on this project, but he did it along with another architect, Baccio Pontelli. Additionally, according to inscriptions in the castle, the renovation was completed in 1484, before Giuliano started working for the King of Naples.

=== Church of San Gallo ===

After Giuliano returned from Naples, Lorenzo commissioned him once again to build a church for a group of Augustinian monks. This commission was meant to be used as an example of Medici family public patronage in Florence. Based on correspondences during that time, historians have inferred that construction began on the church in 1488. Chiesa di San Gallo was dedicated to the seventh century saint, Saint Gall of Ireland. According to Giorgio Vasari, Lorenzo loved the design so much that he started referring to Giuliano as Giuliano da San Gallo. Eventually, the name caught on and Giuliano jokingly told Lorenzo that his actual surname, Giamberti, would be forgotten. Lorenzo responded by telling him that he was worthy of starting a new family line with the name Sangallo. In addition to this, the gate in the Florence city wall closest to the church became known as Porta San Gallo. During the 1529 Siege of Florence, the Florentine army retreated within the walls of the city. Unfortunately, since the church was built outside of the city walls, it was destroyed.

=== Palazzo Gondi ===

Around the same time that Giuliano da Sangallo was commissioned to build the Church of San Gallo, he was also commissioned by a wealthy Florentine merchant, Giuliano Gondi, of the old, Florentine banking Gondi family. After hearing of Sangallo&#x27;s work for the Medici family and the King of Naples, Gondi requested that he build a new Palazzo Gondi in Florence. For this project, Giuliano relied on the design of the other large palaces in the city such as the Palazzo Medici Riccardi and Palazzo Strozzi. Like both of those palaces, the Palazzo Gondi featured the use of finer levels of stone on each ascending level of the façade. Unfortunately, like many of his commissions, this palace was not finished within Giuliano&#x27;s lifetime or within the lifetime of his patron, Giuliano Gondi. The palace continued to be renovated and expanded on for almost two more centuries. Because of these renovations, historians have been unable to definitively identify Sangallo&#x27;s original plan.

=== Palazzo della Rovere ===

Shortly after Giuliano completed his work on Santa Maria delle Carceri, his patron and longtime friend Lorenzo died in 1492. After the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent, a power vacuum was created that allowed an opportunity for France to invade Florence in 1494. The French invasion forced the Medici family and their followers, including Giuliano, out of Florence and into exile. Two years previously, the Bishop of Ostia, Giuliano della Rovere, had fled Italy after his rival in the church, Rodrigo Borgia, was elected Pope as Alexander VI in 1492. Using the shared exile and his past history as a patron of architecture, he convinced Sangallo to design a palace in Savona, France for him.
The palace design was greatly influenced by the Bishop&#x27;s other estates such as the one in Vincoli and the fortress in Ostia that Sangallo helped renovate. Giuliano della Rovere was fueled by a rivalry with his cousin, Rafaelle della Rovere, to make his palace in Savona the biggest that the city had seen. Della Rovere achieved this by purchasing the properties surrounding the family estate. Like Alberti&#x27;s design for the Palazzo Rucellai in Florence, Sangallo reconciled the fact that the palazzo was made up of multiple buildings by creating one large, towering façade. Also like the Palazzo Rucellai, Sangallo used the concept of reducing the size of each ascending level of the façade in order to make it appear more imposing from street level.

== Late career and death ==
Giuliano&#x27;s final work was to assist in the design and construction of the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Sangallo was called upon to design the new church. Pope Julius II, however, appointed Donato Bramante instead and construction began in 1506. Giuliano was called by Julius II to help Michelangelo remove mould from the Sistine Chapel ceiling after the younger artist had applied too wet a plaster. After Giuliano&#x27;s distinguished career and close working relationship with Julius II, Bramante&#x27;s promotion left Giuliano devastated and he left Rome for Florence. After the death of Julius II and the subsequent election of Giovanni de&#x27; Medici to the papacy in 1513 as Pope Leo X, along with the death of Bramante in 1514, Giuliano was recalled to Rome from Florence to help rebuild the basilica. By this time however, Giuliano was over 70 years old and not well enough to travel back to Rome and oversee a project of such magnitude. Therefore, Pope Leo X selected another distinguished artist, Raphael, to assume control of the design of the new basilica.

Giuliano died in Florence in 1516.

== Legacy ==
Giuliano&#x27;s legacy is unlike other architects of the era, because many of his largest works remain either unfinished or are no longer standing at all such as Santa Maria delle Carceri, Palazzo Gondi, and the Church of San Gallo. Instead, his legacy is largely based on more abstract concepts. Sangallo&#x27;s legacy remains through his &quot;Sienese Sketchbook&quot;. This sketchbook provides an intimate look into Sangallo&#x27;s mind. It includes ideas he had for concepts ranging from new forms of artillery to cathedral domes to sculptures. Many of these designs were accompanied by measurements and technical details. Additionally, the sketchbook features drawings Sangallo did of already existing structures that he saw on his travels throughout Italy and Europe. Based on this, it appears that Sangallo was also interested in the study of medieval architecture as well as classical architecture.

In addition to the sketchbook, the name Sangallo came to be associated with high quality architecture, because of Giuliano&#x27;s impressive career. After his reputation grew, other architects of the time adopted Sangallo as a name to try and associate themselves with Giuliano&#x27;s skill and ability.

<text>Greg Hetson (born June 29, 1961) is an American musician. He is best known as the guitarist for the influential punk rock bands Circle Jerks and Bad Religion. He is known for his high energy stage antics which people have coined the term &quot;The Hetson Leap&quot;. Hetson was a founding member of and also plays guitar in another supergroup, Punk Rock Karaoke, and the hardcore punk band G.F.P.

== Career ==

===The Circle Jerks===
In 1980, Hetson abandoned his position as guitarist of the punk/alternative band Redd Kross to form The Circle Jerks with former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris. Soon after, they released their debut LP, &quot;Group Sex&quot; and in 1980 were featured in the Los Angeles documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; along with several other Los Angeles punk bands.

In 1982, The Circle Jerks released their second album &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;. This album, while popular, did not sell nearly as much as their third LP &quot;Golden Shower of Hits&quot;, released in 1983.

While Bad Religion was on hiatus, the Circle Jerks continued touring and recorded two more albums (&quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;) before breaking up in 1990. However, they reformed in 1994 and released &quot;Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities&quot;, their last album to date, a year later. Hetson would continue to play for both Bad Religion and The Circle Jerks. Despite having not released a full-length album since 1995 (although they did release a new song, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Live&quot;, on MySpace in 2007), the Circle Jerks have been playing live occasionally over the years, with the exception of two more hiatuses, one from 1995 to 2001, and another from 2011 to 2019. In 2019 the band announced plans for a 2020 tour to celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Group Sex&quot; however the tour was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023 and 2024, Circle Jerks toured with Descendents. 

=== Bad Religion ===
Greg Hetson was credited on Bad Religion&#x27;s album &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; for playing the solo for the song Part III. His first (official) release with Bad Religion was the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; EP, released in 1985, which declared the band&#x27;s return to their original punk sound after releasing the highly unsuccessful, progressive rock album &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, after which the band disbanded.

After the release of &quot;Back to the Known&quot;, Bad Religion broke up for a second time, but reformed in 1986 with the &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; line-up and Hetson was included. Bad Religion recorded their first three highly acclaimed reunion albums, &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot; and &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, before drummer Pete Finestone quit the band in 1991.

Bad Religion replaced Finestone with Bobby Schayer, then recorded their next album, &quot;Generator&quot;. The album was completed in the spring of 1991, but the band was forced to delay its release until a year later. For the album, Bad Religion also filmed their first music video &quot;Atomic Garden&quot;, which was also their first song to be released as a single. In 1993, the band left their original label Epitaph Records and signed to Atlantic Records, who released their next album &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;. While moderately successful, this was the first Bad Religion album to reach any Billboard charts and two videos for the album, &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot;, were made.

The band&#x27;s popularity grew in 1994 with their widely successful album &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, including their well-known hits &quot;Infected&quot; and &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, which are often considered concert staples. After the album was completed, longtime guitarist Brett Gurewitz soon left Bad Religion to concentrate on the future of Epitaph, citing the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph&#x27;s offices as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s, but it was well known that his departure was not on good terms.

Gurewitz was replaced by former Minor Threat/Dag Nasty guitarist Brian Baker and Bad Religion recorded three more albums without him. He returned to the band in 2001, the line-up consisting of Greg Graffin (vocals), Gurewitz, Hetson, Baker (all on guitar), Jay Bentley (bass) and Brooks Wackerman (drums).

In April 2013, Hetson stopped touring with Bad Religion, supposedly due to divorce, and after briefly playing as a four-piece band (as Gurewitz does not tour with the band due to his commitments with Epitaph), Bad Religion recruited Mike Dimkich of The Cult to fill in for Hetson. Bassist Jay Bentley released the following statement: &quot;Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes to make a statement we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us out right now, and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows.&quot; In January 2014, Bentley confirmed that Dimkich is an official member of Bad Religion, meaning that Hetson is no longer a member of the band. In April 2014, Hetson tweeted that he is no longer in Bad Religion, later claiming he was &quot;kicked out&quot; of the band.

=== Punk Rock Karaoke ===
Hetson plays guitar in the all star band Punk Rock Karaoke with Eric Melvin of NOFX, and Steve Soto of The Adolescents, Stan Lee of The Dickies and original Goldfinger drummer Darrin Pfeiffer.
Other notable past and recurring members have included Bob Mothersbaugh of Devo, and Mike Watt of Minutemen, Iggy and the Stooges. It was the first interactive live Punk Karaoke band since 1996. The band released DVD/CD set on MVD which has &quot;sing along with&quot; videos as well as a covers album featuring singers such as Matt Skiba, Dave King and Mike Herrera.

=== New Musical Project ===
Hetson is currently working with Loomis Fall, on a side project which include guests Bobby Alt, Chris Vrenna, Christopher Chartrand and engineered by Josh Achziger, though no release date has been stated.

<text>Jay Dee Bentley (born June 6, 1964) is the bassist and co-founding member of the punk rock group Bad Religion. He has played with the band through its whole existence with a small break between 1983 and 1985. Along with vocalist Greg Graffin, Bentley has appeared on nearly all of Bad Religion&#x27;s studio albums, with the sole exception being their second album &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; (1983).

==Career==
Jay Bentley grew up in Santa Clarita, California, and later moved to Woodland Hills. As with guitarist Brett Gurewitz and lead singer Greg Graffin, he was a student of El Camino Real High School. He played in Bad Religion for three years (1980–1983), and left while the band was in the midst of writing and recording their second album, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;.

Bentley was a onetime member of such notable L.A. groups as Wasted Youth, T.S.O.L., The Circle Jerks and Cathedral Of Tears. He rejoined Bad Religion in late 1985 while the &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; line-up – adding Circle Jerks&#x27; Greg Hetson as the band&#x27;s second guitarist – was reuniting to record the first three reunion albums, &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot; and &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, which are often considered their best releases. Today, Bentley continues touring and recording with Bad Religion. He has appeared on every Bad Religion release, with the exceptions of &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; (1983) and the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; (1985) EP. The band&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Age of Unreason&quot;, was recorded in 2018 and 2019, with a May 1, 2019 release. Since the early 2010s, Bentley has been the regular touring member of Me First And The Gimme Gimmes filling in on bass and backup vocals for Fat Mike.

==Personal life==
Bentley has two sons: Miles (born 1991), who played bass in Dave Hause and The Mermaid, and Hunter (born 1993). He also has a daughter named Peribeau and a son named Dragon and lives with his wife Natalia Fabia in Costa Mesa, California.

In the past, Bentley has had struggles with alcoholism. He first quit drinking in 1990 but relapsed in 1998. Since 2005, he is completely alcohol abstinent.

==Equipment==
Bentley&#x27;s main basses have been Fender models for most of his career in Bad Religion, primarily a black and/or white Precision models; in recent years, however, he has been an endorser of Epiphone and has his own Jack Casady signature. Bentley often plays bass with a pick.

<doc id="991646" wikidata="Q3489446" url="?curid=991646" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">
<text>Cabinet collective responsibility, also known as collective ministerial responsibility, is a constitutional convention in parliamentary systems and a cornerstone of the Westminster system of government, that members of the cabinet must publicly support all governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree with them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature. This convention formed in the 19th century in the United Kingdom. Some political parties, most commonly communist, apply a similar convention of democratic centralism to their central committee.

If a member of the Cabinet wishes to openly object to a Cabinet decision then they are obliged to resign from their position in the Cabinet.

Cabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that if a vote of no confidence is passed in parliament, the government is responsible collectively, and thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new government will be formed or parliament will be dissolved and a general election will be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as individual ministerial responsibility, which states that ministers are responsible for the running of their departments, and therefore culpable for the departments&#x27; mistakes.

==Overview==
Cabinet collective responsibility is a tradition in parliamentary governments in which the prime minister is responsible for appointing the cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers are usually selected from the same political party as the prime minister to make collective decision-making for legislation faster and more effective. Unlike a presidential system, as used, for example, in the United States, a parliamentary system&#x27;s executive and legislative branches are intertwined. Because of the fusion of powers of the executive and legislative branches the prime minister relies on the cabinet to always support policy decisions. A breach of cabinet collective responsibility, such as when a cabinet member publicly disagrees with an executive decision, results in resignation or termination from the cabinet. The New South Wales Parliamentary Library Research Service in Australia explains that &quot;one aspect of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers share responsibility for major government decisions, particularly those made by the cabinet and, even if they personally object to such decisions, Ministers must be prepared to accept and defend them or resign from the cabinet&quot;.

Cabinet collective responsibility consists of two main features:
;Cabinet confidentiality: the members of the cabinet must not reveal the content of discussions which take place. This allows for cabinet members to privately debate and raise concerns.
;Cabinet solidarity: the members of the cabinet must publicly show a unified position, and must vote with the government even if they privately disagree with the decision that has been made.

Collective responsibility is not circumvented by appointing Ministers outside of Cabinet, as has occurred in New Zealand where, from 2005 to 2008, Winston Peters and Peter Dunne were Ministers outside of Cabinet, despite their parties not being considered part of a coalition.

In non-parliamentary governments like that of the United States, cabinet collective responsibility is not formally practiced. This is due to a clearer separation of the executive and the legislature in policy-making. The United States president&#x27;s cabinet members cannot simultaneously serve in Congress, and therefore cannot vote on legislation supported by the executive. The president instead has veto power over legislation passed by Congress. Cabinet unity and collective agreement between members are important to cabinet stability and party politics, but cabinet members do not have to publicly support legislation proposed or supported by the president. It is, however, in a cabinet member&#x27;s best interest to support and align with the president&#x27;s policies because they serve at the pleasure of the president, who can at any time dismiss them or appoint them to another position.

==Examples==
Parliamentary democracies such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada practice and adhere to cabinet collective responsibility. Rhodes, Wanna and Weller offer this description of the principle of cabinet solidarity in Westminster systems of parliamentary democracy: &quot;Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility are twin dimensions of responsible party government that enjoy constitutionality, albeit informally. They lie at the core of ministerial governance. Cabinet solidarity is purely a political convention designed to maintain or protect the collective good as perceived by a partisan ministry. It rests on the notion that the executive ought to appear a collective entity, able to maintain cohesion and display political strength&quot;.

===Australia===
In Australia, cabinet collective responsibility is fundamental to cabinet confidentiality, but also to protect private information from becoming public and possibly threatening national security. Cabinet solidarity is not a legal requirement, but a political convention and practiced norm. There is no written law that upholds cabinet collective responsibility, but it is deeply ingrained in Australia&#x27;s cabinets as a political norm and is therefore an important aspect of the collective strength and influence of the prime minister&#x27;s administration.

Occasionally on highly controversial issues such as the 1999 republic referendum, there may be a conscience vote where any MP may vote as they wish, but these issues are rare and never tied to official party policy, and normally party discipline is very tight.

===Canada===
In Canada, the cabinet is on rare occasion allowed to freely vote its conscience and to oppose the government without consequence, as occurred with the vote on capital punishment under Brian Mulroney. These events are rare and are never on matters of confidence. The most prominent Canadian cabinet minister to resign because he could not vote with the cabinet was John Turner, who refused to support wage and price controls. In Canada, party discipline is much tighter than in other Westminster-system countries; it is very rare for any MP to vote counter to the party leadership.

===Finland===
In Finland, collective responsibility has been established both constitutionally and as a convention. The Finnish Government and its ministers are collectively responsible for all its decisions. However, the constitution allows a minister to dissent by expressing an objection which is entered into the minutes. Nevertheless, while formally allowed, dissent is uncommon because it jeopardizes the stability of the government. Namely, majority coalition governments became the norm after President Kekkonen retired in 1981. A new cabinet must be approved by a parliamentary majority, thus a government platform is agreed upon by the participating parties. It is distinct from party platforms and details the compromises that parties made in order to cooperate. If a party fails to follow the government platform, other parties in the government can pull the plug and force the entire government to resign.

===Ireland===
Article 28.4.2° of the Constitution of Ireland states:
:The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.
In 1992, the Beef Tribunal was investigating allegations of political corruption, and wanted to take evidence from a minister about cabinet meetings at which controversial proposals had been discussed. The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that such discussions could not be disclosed because Article 28.4.2° required absolute confidentiality of cabinet discussions (though not of decisions which were formally recorded). The Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution was passed by referendum in 1997 to add Article 28.4.3°, which allows such disclosures in exceptional circumstances.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, the principle of cabinet confidentiality is always observed. However, Cabinet solidarity can be weakened in coalition governments in which members from junior parties in the cabinet can openly dissent on specific policies through &quot;agree to disagree&quot; arrangements.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom practices cabinet collective responsibility. The prime minister selects a number of cabinet ministers from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Once selected as cabinet ministers, each minister leads one of the government departments. Cabinet ministers respond to oral questions from MPs. The cabinet members, along with the Prime Minister, schedule weekly closed door sessions to discuss the collective stance of the cabinet to avoid inconsistent responses from cabinet ministers. The solidarity of the cabinet is consistently challenged by the opposition in an attempt to create contradictions between cabinet ministers. It is therefore imperative for the cabinet members to have their responses as common and similar as possible.

In the United Kingdom, the doctrine applies to all members of the government, from members of the cabinet down to Parliamentary Private Secretaries. Its inner workings are set out in the Ministerial Code. On occasion, this principle has been suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the National Government allowed its Liberal members to oppose the introduction of protective tariffs; and again when Harold Wilson allowed Cabinet members to campaign both for and against the 1975 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Economic Community. In 2003, Tony Blair allowed Clare Short to stay in the cabinet, despite her public opposition to the 2003 Iraq War; however, she later resigned.

Prime Minister David Cameron suspended the cabinet collective responsibility doctrine for the 2016 EU referendum, following the precedent set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Prominent cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Chris Grayling opted to make use of the relaxation by campaigning to leave.

==Advantages==
A parliamentary system that uses cabinet collective responsibility is more likely to avoid contradictions and disagreements between cabinet members of the executive branch. Cabinet ministers are likely to feel there is a practical and collective benefit from being part of a team. Cabinet collective responsibility to the people also benefits party and personal loyalty to the prime minister. Solidarity within the cabinet can strengthen the prime minister&#x27;s party and accelerate policy decisions and interests of that party. Presidential democracies often lack the ability to pass legislation quickly in times of emergency or instances of national security.

==Disadvantages==
Because cabinet collective responsibility forces the cabinet ministers to publicly agree with the prime minister&#x27;s decisions, political debate and internal discourse is hindered. When disagreements occur within a cabinet dependent on collective responsibility, negotiating collective agreements can be difficult. Cabinet collective responsibility is therefore dependent on the mutual agreement and collective unity of the cabinet and its members.

<text>Antonio da Sangallo the Elder (c. 145327 December 1534) was an Italian Renaissance architect who specialized in the design of fortifications.

==Biography==
Antonio da Sangallo was born in Florence.

Sangallo&#x27;s father Francesco Giamberti was a woodworker. His brother Giuliano da Sangallo and nephew Antonio da Sangallo the Younger were also architects. Sangallo&#x27;s godson, Giulio de Medici (the future Pope Clement VII) was raised in his household until the boy reached the age of seven, when Giulio&#x27;s uncle Lorenzo the Magnificent became his full-time guardian.

Sangallo often worked in partnership with his brother; however, he executed a number of independent works. As a military engineer he was especially skillful, building important works at Arezzo, Montefiascone, Florence and Rome. His most outstanding work as an architect is the church of San Biagio at Montepulciano, in plan a Greek cross with central dome, &quot;the first of the great cinquecento domes to be completed&quot;. and two towers—resembling, on a smaller scale, Bramante&#x27;s design for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Sangallo also built a palace in the same city, various churches and palaces at Monte San Savino, and, at Florence, a range of monastic buildings for the Servite monks. His other works includes he church of San Biagio at Montepulciano, the Forte Sangallo of Civita Castellana and the Old Fortress of Livorno. Antonio retired early from the practice of his profession, and spent his latter years in farming.

<doc id="991655" wikidata="Q126039" url="?curid=991655" title="Beggars Banquet Records">
<text>Beggars Banquet Records is a British independent record label. Beggars Banquet started as a chain of record shops owned by Martin Mills and Nick Austin and is part of the Beggars Group of labels.

==History==
In 1977, spurred by the prevailing DIY aesthetics of the British punk rock movement (then at the height of its popularity), Martin Mills and Nick Austin founded a record label to release records under the Beggars Banquet imprint. The first band on the label was the English punk group the Lurkers; the first release on the label was the Lurkers&#x27; 7&quot; single &quot;Shadow&quot;/&quot;Love Story&quot;. They also released the first solo &quot;Duffo&quot; album from Australian big-band vocalist Jeff Duff. Later in the decade and into the early 1980s, hits with Tubeway Army and Gary Numan secured the label&#x27;s future. Other bands who were signed to the label include the Associates, Bauhaus, the Cult, Biffy Clyro, Flesh for Lulu, Gene Loves Jezebel, the Icicle Works and the Go-Betweens.

<text>A vanishing twin, also known as twin resorption, is a fetus in a multigestation pregnancy that dies &quot;in utero &quot;and is then partially or completely reabsorbed. In some instances, the dead twin is compressed into a flattened, parchment-like state known as &quot;fetus papyraceus&quot;.

Vanishing twins occur in up to one of every eight multifetus pregnancies and may not even be known in most cases. &quot;High resorption rates, which cannot be explained on the basis of the expected abortion rate, suggest intense fetal competition for space, nutrition, or other factors during early gestation, with frequent loss or resorption of the other twin(s).&quot; Vanishing twin syndrome has been characterized as the loss of a twin before 12 weeks of gestation, or early during the first trimester where it is uncommon for twin pregnancy to have been identified. 

According to Boklage, most twin pregnancies are ultimately born as singles, and vanished twins are a possible source of abnormal cells. In one study, Boklage reported of 325 twin pregnancies, finding that only 61 ended as twins, a 125 ended as singletons. The remainder were lost. He has estimated that for every twin pair born, there are six singletons who survived a twin conception. 

In pregnancies achieved by &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization, &quot;it frequently happens that more than one amniotic sac can be seen in early pregnancy, whereas a few weeks later there is only one to be seen and the other has &#x27;vanished.

<text>The Daxue Range or Daxue Mountains () are a great mountain range in the western part of Sichuan province in Southwest China. It is part of the Hengduan Mountains, a complicated system of mountain ranges of western Sichuan, which itself is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

==Geography==
The Daxue Mountain Range runs for several hundred kilometers in a general north-south direction, mostly within Sichuan&#x27;s Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

The Daxue Range marks a transitional zone between the arid Tibetan Plateau and the wetter Sichuan Basin.
It separates the basins of the Yalong River (to the west) and the Dadu River (to the east). Both rivers flow in the general southern direction, and are tributaries of the Yangtze.

The tallest peak of the range, the Gongga Shan (Minya Konka), measures 7,556 meters in height. It is located in the southern part of the range.

To the east and south of the Gongga Shan, the Daxue Mountains are adjacent to the smaller Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges, which, however, are usually considered by cartographers as separate ranges.

==Content==
The album includes material from the Beatles&#x27; days as the Quarrymen, through the Decca audition to sessions for the album &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;. It is of historical interest as the only official release of performances with Best and Sutcliffe in the band – Sutcliffe, the band&#x27;s original bass player during 1960, and sporadically during the group&#x27;s second Hamburg season, appears on the disc-one tracks &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot; and &quot;Cayenne&quot;; while Best, who was the official drummer from just prior to the group&#x27;s first departure for Hamburg in August 1960 until 15 August 1962 when he was replaced by Ringo Starr, is on Disc One, tracks 10–12, 15–19 and 21–22.

Disc One, tracks 10–12, were recorded at a session in Hamburg where the Beatles served as the back-up band to the English rock and roll musician Tony Sheridan. Some songs from this session were released on the 1962 album &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. The song &quot;My Bonnie&quot; would be their introductory single in England, featuring Sheridan on lead vocal and guitar. Tracks 21–22 are the only surviving recordings of the Beatles&#x27; first EMI session. Track 22 is the original recording of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, which would be re-recorded by the group four months later for their first single. Track 24 features EMI session drummer Andy White in place of Starr.

Disc Two contains performances from comedy duo Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s popular television programme, &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, as well as the opening song from their famed performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which introduced the band to most of the US in 1964.

The flash-point for the album came with the song &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; – the three remaining Beatles Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr re-working a John Lennon demo recording given to McCartney by Lennon&#x27;s widow, Yoko Ono. Produced by Harrison&#x27;s Traveling Wilburys bandmate Jeff Lynne, the three added additional music and lyrics, instrumentation and backing vocals, with McCartney and Harrison both taking a turn at a lead vocal. Released a week after the compilation, the CD single featured three exclusive B-sides.

The live BBC Radio recording of &quot;Lend Me Your Comb&quot; was held back from &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; for inclusion on this album, but it was later also included on &quot;On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2&quot;.

==Album cover==
The cover of &quot;Anthology 1&quot; is the first third of the &quot;Anthology&quot; collage made by Klaus Voormann and Alfons Kiefer. Various photographs and album covers are torn and collected together. Pete Best&#x27;s face was torn away from the &quot;Savage Young Beatles&quot; record jacket in the centre of the album cover, revealing the face of his successor, Ringo Starr, below. The bottom leftmost photograph on the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; cover does feature an unobscured Best.

The missing portion of the photo was subsequently used on the cover of Best&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Haymans Green,&quot; an act described by one fan as &quot;Pete Best&#x27;s revenge&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was a large success throughout the world. It was the first Beatles album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at number one. It sold 855,473 copies in its first week, the 27th largest one-week sales in the Soundscan history, succeeding &quot;Fresh Horses&quot; by Garth Brooks. In its second week, &quot;Anthology 1&quot; sold 453,000 copies and maintained the top spot. This was repeated the following week, with 435,000 copies sold. In its fourth week, the same quantity was sold, but the album fell to number two, behind Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot;. In the following week, the album fell to number three but with 601,000 sales. &quot;Anthology 1&quot; was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA after six weeks in the US market. In all, the album spent 29 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching cumulative sales of 3,639,000 sales as of April 2001. In the UK, reaction was similar, but the album peaked at number two, behind Robson &amp; Jerome&#x27;s eponymous album. In Australia, the album spent two weeks at number one in December 1995.

<text>Interstate 485 (I-485), also known as the Charlotte Outerbelt, is a auxiliary Interstate Highway encircling Charlotte, North Carolina. As a complete loop, it is primarily signed with &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; designations, though at some major interchanges, supplemental signage reflects the local compass orientation of the road. The entire route lies within Mecklenburg County.

A beltway for the Charlotte metropolitan area was first proposed in the mid-1970s, with the first section opening in 1990. The beltway was completed in stages over the next several decades, including the completion of the last segment of the highway on June 5, 2015.

==Route description==
All of I-485 is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important for the nation&#x27;s defense, economy, and mobility. Most of I-485 ranges from four to eight lanes wide, and the speed limit for the entire loop is .

=== Western half ===
The mileage begins at I-77/US 21 in southern Charlotte, near the South Carolina state line. The southwestern segment of I-485 from here to I-85 is known as the Seddon &quot;Rusty&quot; Goode Jr. Freeway. Proceeding through, I-485 crosses I-77/US 21 on a pair of bridges connecting I-485 to I-77, and vice versa. Past the bridges, the terrain of the Interstate transitions from asphalt to concrete. Crossing Coffey Creek, a branch of Sugar Creek, I-485 passes through generally suburban development with trees lining the sides of the road. Shortly after, it meets NC 49 (South Tryon Street), one of the primary thoroughfares through Charlotte. The Interstate gradually makes a slight curve to the north and meets an interchange with Arrowood Road, another one of Charlotte&#x27;s main streets, with a Topgolf restaurant seen to the side. I-485 then curves left again and intersects NC 160 (Steele Creek Road), providing access to Charlotte Premium Outlets. Yet again, I-485 turns entirely north, exiting the suburban areas and entering some rural development. Crossing over the Piedmont rail line of Amtrak and a small stream, I-485 intersects with US 29/US 74 (Wilkinson Boulevard), allowing entrance to the main terminal of Charlotte Douglas International Airport. At that same moment, I-485 immediately meets I-85 at a stack interchange. The lanes from I-485 to southbound I-85 are often congested due to them merging into one.

North of the I-85 interchange, the naming of I-485 changes to the Craig Lawing Freeway, named after W. Craig Lawing, the former senator and politician of North Carolina. I-485 passes through more rural areas and just west of a wildlife refuge and lake. I-485 then intersects a roundabout interchange with Moores Chapel Road, allowing drivers to reach the U.S. National Whitewater Center. The Interstate next meets NC 27 at a partial cloverleaf interchange for Mount Holly, then crosses the Long Creek, a tributary of the Catawba River. I-485 continues through forested land and near a dog park before utilizing another partial cloverleaf interchange with NC 16 (Brookshire Boulevard) for Newton at milemarker 16. The interchange as of 2018 has been undergoing a feasibility study that would help improve traffic flow to I-485 and widen the northbound lanes on NC 16. I-485 then makes a gradual turn northeast, meeting another roundabout interchange with Oakdale Road, opened in 2017. 

Continuing through forest yet again, I-485 turns even further to the east and crosses the Long Creek two more times, then enters suburban areas and meets the western terminus of NC 24 (Harris Boulevard) at an interchange with a single cloverleaf, where drivers on NC 24 can access Northlake Mall. I-485 then turns slightly northeast, entering Huntersville, and crosses another small stream before making another curve back east, intersecting with I-77 again at a large interchange composed of partial cloverleaf and turbine interchange ramps. The segment of I-485 from here to I-85 is the latest segment of the Interstate, completed in 2015.

I-485 also picks up the name H. Allen Tate Jr. Highway, named after Allen Tate, the founder of Allen Tate Realtors. It immediately has a partial cloverleaf for NC 115 at exit 23C, which is proposed to undergo widening from I-485 to NC 24. The Interstate also passes above US 21 without direct access and then intersects a unique roundabout interchange with Benfield Road, Prosperity Church Road, and Prosperity Ridge Road; these three roads are all accessed via Robert Helms Road going inbound and Craven Thomas Road outbound respectively. I-485 then turns a bit southeast and reaches a diverging diamond interchange with Mallard Creek Road, another one of Charlotte&#x27;s main roads. It turns even more in a southeast direction and reaches a turbine interchange with I-85 once more.

=== Eastern half ===

From the I-85 interchange, I-485 becomes the Governor James G. Martin Freeway, named after the former governor of North Carolina. The terrain of I-485 becomes a mixture of concrete and asphalt, and the Interstate passes through somewhat suburban areas, intersecting US 29 (North Tryon Street) a second time, providing access to Concord Mills and Charlotte Motor Speedway. I-485 then meets NC 49 (University City Boulevard) at a partial cloverleaf interchange also a mile later for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. It passes underneath Lynx Blue Line and crosses the Back Creek as it yet again enters rural areas, going over the Reedy Creek and paralleling, later crossing the McKee Creek, both of them being tributaries of the Rocky River. 

From here, the terrain is entirely asphalt. I-485 then meets NC 24/NC 27 (Albemarle Road) a second time at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The Interstate intersects with NC 51 (Blair Road) a mile later near the town of Mint Hill. It turns entirely due south, then intersects NC 218 a mile after that by crossing the Clear Creek. Passing Idlewild Road, which underwent construction numerous times, I-485 turns southwest, and utilizes another partial cloverleaf interchange with US 74. The interchange ramps were closed as part of a project to build express lanes along I-485 on August 1, 2023.

Several miles later, I-485 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with NC 16 (Providence Road) again, just outside the Ballantyne neighborhood, where it travels entirely in a westward direction. It then enters suburban areas and receives the northern terminus of US 521 (Johnston Road) at milemarker 61. The express lanes in the future will connect Johnston Road directly to I-485, and vice versa. I-485 then turns a little northwest, crossing McAlpine Creek, another tributary of the Catawba River before turning in a north direction and intersecting NC 51 (Pineville-Matthews Road) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. A mile later, I-485 passes just south of the I-485/South Boulevard park and ride located off of South Boulevard at milemarker 65, as well as access to the President James K. Polk Historic Site. I-485 then continues northwest, crossing Sugar Creek, before reaching I-77/US 21 at a stack interchange, completing the beltway and resetting the mileage.
===Orientation and signage===

Since I-485 is a beltway, the compass orientation of the freeway is not uniform around the loop. To remedy the uniformity issue, the inner–outer orientation system was implemented and became the primary method of signing the direction of travel around the loop. Some sections of the loop are signed with additional north–south or east/west labels (depending on the general direction of travel along a particular stretch) to aid drivers familiar with compass directions. Usually when both systems are utilized on signs, the compass directional banner is placed above the number shield and the inner/outer banner is placed below. Officials originally decided to use only &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; compass directions when signing the route, but, because this would be confusing with multiple &quot;norths&quot; and &quot;souths&quot;, &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; designations were included. Although &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; signs exist, these were phased out in favor of &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; designations.

Traffic traveling in a clockwise direction around the city of Charlotte is on the &quot;Inner&quot; loop and traffic traveling in a counterclockwise direction is on the &quot;Outer&quot; loop. This system can be confusing, but it is logical; since traffic in the US generally travels on the right side of the road, the clockwise traveling lanes will always be the &quot;Inner&quot; lanes of a loop.

There are three control cities along the route: Huntersville, Matthews, and Pineville. Secondary control cities, which include Spartanburg, Statesville, Greensboro, and Columbia, are also listed at various interchanges for travelers that want to bypass Charlotte to other destinations, via I-77 and I-85.

===Dedicated and memorial names===
I-485 in North Carolina is split into four dedicated or memorialized stretches of freeway:

* Seddon &quot;Rusty&quot; Goode Freeway: The official name of the southwest section, from milemarkers 0 to 10. Seddon Goode served on the transportation board in Mecklenburg County and helped bring I-485 as a reality. It was approved on March 7, 1997.
* Craig Lawing Freeway: The official name of the northwest section, named for W. Craig Lawing from milemarkers 10 to 23 that was approved on February 2, 2001.
* H. Allen Tate Jr. Highway: The official name of the northeast section, from milemarkers 23 to 31. It was named after the founder of Allen Tate Realtors and was dedicated on March 27, 2015.
** Doctor Jay M. Robinson Freeway: It was the official name of the northeast section, from 2001 to 2015 and named after a former superintendent of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system. Approved on January 5, 2001, it was never signed; when this section was finally constructed in 2015, it was redesignated to honor H. Allen Tate Jr.
* Governor James G. Martin Freeway: The official name of the southeast section, from milemarkers 31 to 67. It was named in honor of Governor James G. Martin who served North Carolina from 1985 to 1993 and was approved on December 4, 1993.

==History==

The first section of what became I-485 was completed around 1967, connecting a newly opened section of I-85 with US 29 near the Cabarrus–Mecklenburg county line. This section became a part of I-485 on May 5, 1999, the first section of the highway on the north end of the county.

In 1975, planning began for the Charlotte outerbelt.

On July 8, 1988, Governor James G. Martin and state transportation secretary Seddon Goode attended a groundbreaking near US 521, marking the start of construction on the first section between US 521 and North Carolina Highway 51 (NC 51). Martin also announced the designation &quot;Interstate 485&quot; for what had previously been called the outerbelt. The section opened November 1, 1990, two months earlier than planned. 

A $67.2-million (equivalent to $ in ) section of I-485 from US 521 to I-77 was opened on October 24, 1994. This section included a four-level interchange, the first and only in North Carolina, at its junction with I-77. On December 9, 1994, the section from NC 51 to Rea Road was opened.

On July 1, 1997, a $13.9-million (equivalent to $ in ) section of I-485 was opened between I-77 and NC 49, a section designated the Seddon &quot;Rusty&quot; Goode Jr. Freeway, named for a member of the North Carolina Board of Transportation who helped decide where I-485 would be built.

On August 15, 1997, of I-485 were opened between Rea Road and NC 16 (Providence Road). An $8.6-million (equivalent to $ in ) section from NC 49 to Brown-Grier Road in the Steele Creek community was opened in two stages in August 26 and 27; the name of Brown-Grier Road was changed to Arrowood Road when that road was extended. were opened on September 15, connecting NC 16 to US 74.

In May 1999, the original segment between I-85 and US 29 (North Tryon Street) was widened and rebuilt to Interstate standards, officially becoming part of I-485; a few months later, on August 13, the segment was extended to NC 49 (University City Boulevard). In December 1999, the main section of I-485 continued its extension north from US 74 to Idlewild Road, adding . In June 2000, another extension was completed, between Idlewild Road and Lawyers Road in Mint Hill, at a cost of $10.2 million (equivalent to $ in ).

In 2003, the last needed to link main I-485 to its northern stub were completed, at a cost of $55.4 million (equivalent to $ in ). Opening in two phases, the first segment was opened on September 3, 2003, between University City Boulevard and NC 27 (Albemarle Road). Two months later, the second segment was opened on November 19, between Albemarle Road and Lawyers Road.

On October 19, 2004, I-485 was widened, from four to six lanes between I-77/US 21 and Arrowood Road, and extended between Arrowood Road and I-85 (near Belmont). Completion of the $100-million (equivalent to $ in ) segment was noted that it would relieve traffic along the Billy Graham Parkway and provide an alternative route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. On December 15, 2006, a segment between I-85 (near Belmont) and NC 27 (Mount Holly Road) was opened. Signed as Future I-485, it was also dedicated as the Craig Lawing Freeway. Six months later, on May 9, 2007, another segment, between Mount Holly Road and NC 16 (Brookshire Boulevard) was opened. On December 4, 2008, a segment between Brookshire Boulevard and NC 115 (Old Statesville Road) was opened; all future signage was removed from the previous segments, with new signage showing connection between I-77, toward Statesville, and I-85, toward Spartanburg. In 2011, the West Boulevard interchange (exit 6) was opened to traffic, existing previously as a graded future interchange since 2004.

The final segment, from I-77 to I-85 near the UNC Charlotte, had begun the right-of-way acquisition phase with contracts awarded in June 2010. The segment was opened to traffic on June 5, 2015, finally completing the loop and providing a direct connection from I-77 near Huntersville to I-85 near Concord Mills.

Since 2003, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has made sure that future segments of I-485 were designed with a minimum of six travel lanes. While the first segments of I-485 were already choked by traffic due to Charlotte&#x27;s rapid growth, NCDOT could not immediately deal with the issue thanks to a 2000 policy that prevented the state using trust fund money, a major source of funding for new projects, to widen existing roads. Eventually, NCDOT was able to allocate new funds for a widening project, between US 521 (Johnston Road) and I-77/US 21, which was slated for construction in 2012. On November 18, 2011, NCDOT changed the plans with an extension of the widening project to Rea Road and additional space allocated for a future toll lane, between Johnston Road and I-77/US 21. Construction on the modified widening project began in 2013. At a cost of $83.3 million (equivalent to $ in ), the widening project was completed in December 2015.

On January 15, 2017, the Oakdale Road interchange (exit 18) was opened to traffic, existing previously as a graded future interchange since 2008.

==Future==
Since November 18, 2011, NCDOT has made plans for future toll lanes along I-485. Modifying an already planned widening project between US 521 (Johnston Road) and I-77/US 21, it called on a future toll lane to be constructed as well as extending the widening project towards Rea Road. The future toll lanes, when completed would be between US 74 (Independence Boulevard) and I-77/US 21; in April 2014, the Charlotte Regional Transportation Planning Organization (CRTPO) adopted the 2040 Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP), which included establishing toll lanes along I-485. The first segment of the new toll lanes, between Johnston Road and I-77/US 21, were completed in December 2015 but were not opened. The new unopen lanes along I-485 became controversial and discussions were made about making it a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane), or at least temporally; however, local and state officials said that could not be done and would cost more for just temporary use of the lanes.

At a cost of $202.9 million, the I-485 Express Lanes project will establish new toll lanes along its entire planned route. It will also include the following improvements: adding additional general purpose lanes between Providence Road and Rea Road, extending auxiliary lanes between Independence Boulevard and East John Street, establishing dedicated connectors from the Express Lanes to Johnston Road (eastbound only) and Westinghouse Boulevard (westbound only), and incorporating the existing planned project of adding a new interchange at Weddington Road. Tolls would be collected using an electronic toll collection (ETC) system; drivers will need to have the NC Quick Pass, or other interoperable transponder, or will be billed by mail with a higher rate. Construction was slated to begin &quot;tentatively&quot; in mid-2018, but started in Summer 2019, and is currently still going on as of 2024; its completion date is set for Spring/Summer 2025.

<text>In computing, multiple instruction, single data (MISD) is a type of parallel computing architecture where many functional units perform different operations on the same data. Pipeline architectures belong to this type, though a purist might say that the data is different after processing by each stage in the pipeline. Fault tolerance executing the same instructions redundantly in order to detect and mask errors, in a manner known as task replication, may be considered to belong to this type. Applications for this architecture are much less common than MIMD and SIMD, as the latter two are often more appropriate for common data parallel techniques. Specifically, they allow better scaling and use of computational resources. However, one prominent example of MISD in computing are the Space Shuttle flight control computers.

Systolic arrays (&lt; wavefront processors), first described by H. T. Kung and Charles E. Leiserson are an example of MISD architecture. In a typical systolic array, parallel input data flows through a network of hard-wired processor nodes, resembling the human brain which combine, process, merge or sort the input data into a derived result.

Systolic arrays are often hard-wired for a specific operation, such as &quot;multiply and accumulate&quot;, to perform massively parallel integration, convolution, correlation, matrix multiplication or data sorting tasks. A systolic array typically consists of a large monolithic network of primitive computing nodes, which can be hardwired or software-configured for a specific application. The nodes are usually fixed and identical, while the interconnect is programmable. More general wavefront processors, by contrast, employ sophisticated and individually programmable nodes which may or may not be monolithic, depending on the array size and design parameters. Because the wave-like propagation of data through a systolic array resembles the pulse of the human circulatory system, the name systolic was coined from medical terminology.

A significant benefit of systolic arrays is that all operand data and partial results are contained within (passing through) the processor array. There is no need to access external buses, main memory, or internal caches during each operation, as with standard sequential machines. The sequential limits on parallel performance dictated by Amdahl&#x27;s law also do not apply in the same way because data dependencies are implicitly handled by the programmable node interconnect.

Therefore, systolic arrays are extremely good at artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, and other tasks that animal brains do exceptionally well. Wavefront processors, in general, can also be very good at machine learning by implementing self-configuring neural nets in hardware.

While systolic arrays are officially classified as MISD, their classification is somewhat problematic. Because the input is typically a vector of independent values, the systolic array is not SISD. Since these input values are merged and combined into the result(s) and do not maintain their independence as they would in a SIMD vector processing unit, the array cannot be classified as such. Consequently, the array cannot be classified as a MIMD either, since MIMD can be viewed as a mere collection of smaller SISD and SIMD machines.

Finally, because the data swarm is transformed as it passes through the array from node to node, the multiple nodes are not operating on the same data, which makes the MISD classification a misnomer. The other reason why a systolic array should not qualify as a MISD is the same as the one which disqualifies it from the SISD category: The input data is typically a vector, not a single data value, although one could argue that any given input vector is a single dataset.

The above notwithstanding, systolic arrays are often offered as a classic example of MISD architecture in textbooks on parallel computing and in the engineering class. If the array is viewed from the outside as atomic it should perhaps be classified as SFMuDMeR = &quot;single function, multiple data, merged result(s).&quot;

<text>Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (12 April 14843 August 1546), also known as Antonio Cordiani, was an Italian architect active during the Renaissance, mainly in Rome and the Papal States. One of his most popular projects that he worked on designing is St. Peter’s basilica in the Vatican City. He was also an engineer who worked on restoring several buildings. His success was greatly due to his contracts with renowned artists during his time. Sangallo died in Terni, Italy, and was buried in St. Peter’s Basilica.

==Early life and apprenticeship==
Sangallo was born Antonio Cordiani in Florence, the son of Bartolomeo Piccioni. His grandfather Francesco Giamberti was a woodworker, and his uncles Giuliano and Antonio da Sangallo were noted architects of the time. Despite his family ties, Cordiani spent his early life in poverty, resulting from the political and religious turmoil of the fifteenth century. At around age twenty, in 1503, young Cordiani followed his uncles to Rome in order to pursue a career in architecture; he ended up taking the name ″Sangallo″ and then becomes known as Antonio da Sangallo (the younger). Instead of becoming an apprentice to an artist, his apprenticeship consisted of doing carpentry work. After about three years, he began working with Donato Bramante in 1506.

As an assistant to Bramante, Sangallo prepared a number of sketches due to the disability of his master. Bramante valued Sangallo as a draftsman and allowed Sangallo to do the design work for some of his minor projects. Due to his success, Sangallo was eventually put in charge of the Passetto di Borgo between the Papal apartments and the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. That particular project was left unfinished, but it left Sangallo with a working reputation as an architect.

==Independent commissions==
Sangallo quickly received a major commission for the church of Santa Maria di Loreto in 1507. His design called for a square first story and an octagonal second story built in travertine and brick; the dome and lantern were finished many years later. Although Leo X&#x27;s papacy enabled Sangallo to connect with great artists, his main encouragement came from Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (later Pope Paul III). Sangallo received what was likely his first independent commission from Farnese. This piece was the fortress of Capodimonte, set on Lake Bolsena in Italy. Following this was the renovation of a home on the Campo dei Fiori in Rome, later known as the Palazzo Farnese. Although it was not completed until after his death, this palace became one of the most important in Rome, with its structure influencing a later code of academic rules. This palace was what established Sangallo as a mature architect. Sangallo also received a number of further contracts from the Farnese family. For example, he designed a palace (since destroyed) and the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena in the Farnese town of Gradoli. He also designed fortifications for Capo di Monte and Caprarola; the latter eventually became a country estate known as the Villa Farnese.

In addition to the Farnese family, Sangallo had a number of patrons in Rome. He designed the Palazzo Baldassini near the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Agostino for Melchiore Baldassini. Additionally, he designed a tomb for the Cardinal Jaume Serra i Cau in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli. Sangallo was also one of several artists hired to design the Villa Madama by Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, the future Clement VII; he was personally responsible for the final design of the building itself. Although he was obligated to his patrons, he always imposed his own style on his projects. Through these projects, Sangallo acquired the reputation of a master architect in the city of Rome, mostly due to his originality and personal style. When Bramante died in 1514, Sangallo, along with Raphael and Giovanni Giocondo, was appointed to oversee the construction of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica by Pope Leo X. Sangallo was hired extensively by Leo X, not only as an architect, but also as an engineer tasked to restore and save a number of buildings.

== Architectural influences ==
While he was working with Raphael on Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Sangallo had to compromise, but also search to find his own architectural style. He was influenced by other architects of the time, but his main influence and advantage had come from observing the work of his uncles and father at a young age. He likely learned arithmetic and Latin at this time, which would influence his complicated calculations in his later projects. Sangallo had much more thorough training in draftsmanship and carpentry than many other Renaissance architects. This allowed him to ultimately develop a unique, methodical style, as seen in the geometrical patterns common in his work.

Sangallo was influenced by architecture, but also the Italian Renaissance as an artistic time period in which he lived. Even so, he remained highly critical of the Renaissance. Likewise, he was both influenced by and also critical of ancient Roman buildings, including the Pantheon. He practiced &quot;operative criticism,&quot; which looked at architecture through a historical and societal lens. This allowed him to appreciate the works he was studying, but also criticize the drawings for their distorted proportions. Antonio was influenced by ancient works because they inspired him to create more accurate drawings.

== The Sangallo Circle ==
Antonio da Sangallo selected a group of highly qualified designers to assist him with his projects. This group initially included Antonio Labacco (b. 1495-d. 1567), his brother Giovanni Battista da Sangallo (b. 1496-d. 1548), and his cousin Giovan Francesco da Sangllo (b. 1485-d. 1530). After the year 1530, more people joined his group, which included Bartolomeo Baronimo and Giovan Francesco’s brother Sebastiano also known as Aristotile. The members of the Sangallo circle had a variety of experiences and skills that ranged from building tools, pumps, and mills to building entire canals, buildings, and even moving the Vatican obelisk. Sangallo made sure that he always had control over his group, by visiting and surveying all the construction sites he and his group worked on collaboratively. His colleagues sent him architectural drawings for approval and got upset when they did not include sufficient information.

== Design methods ==
Antonio da Sangallo incorporated mathematics into his design and preferred using the orthogonal mode of representation instead of making section and perspective drawings. 

Antonio designed his projects in six stages. The first stage consisted of measuring the site and existing structures that were going to be affected. Then he collaborated with his patrons funding the project to draw sketches of ideas not to scale. The third stage was making the sketches of plans and elevations. After drawing these sketches, he developed them further to make detailed plan, section, and elevation drawings to present to the patrons. The fifth stage consisted of making wooden presentation models and detailed drawings for spaces such as atriums, stairwells, and windows of the building. The final stage was preparing the working drawings on 1:1 scale to instruct the construction workers on how to build his design.

==Engineering feats==
Sangallo was eventually hired to build the foundation for the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini on the bank of the Tiber. Jacopo Sansovino&#x27;s design called for the church to extend into the river, a difficult task given the unstable bank. Sangallo successfully completed the foundation, although at such great expense that there was no longer enough money to build the church. Although the model that Sangallo designed for the church was never built, the construction of Giacomo della Porta&#x27;s designs began later, in 1583.

Another project was the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto. The church had not originally been built well, with cracking vaults and an unstable foundation. Sangallo redesigned the church and shored up the foundations; Vasari claims the church to be ″the best that Antonio ever executed″ despite the challenges innate in rebuilding a church as opposed to building a new one from the ground up. Sangallo was also hired to do similar work on the Vatican loggias, which had shown signs of weakness due to poor construction; his reinforcements stand today.

Sangallo was also a noted military architect, working on the fortifications of numerous cities such as Parma, Piacenza, Ancona and Orvieto. In Orvieto, he was also tasked by Pope Clement VII with building a well, called Saint Patrick&#x27;s Well, noted as a marvel of engineering. Its double-helix ramps around a central open shaft allowed oxen carrying water to go down via one of the ramps and up via the other without having to turn around. Despite its 175-foot depth, the ramps are well lit through windows cut into the centre section. Possibly an inspiration for the design, the Well of Joseph in the Cairo Citadel also featured a double spiral staircase.

== Mechanical drawings ==
Besides architecture and structural engineering, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger was also interested in mechanical engineering. He was interested in studying pulleys and drew many plans of different types of mechanisms using a straight edge and compasses between the years of 1527 and 1532. Some of these drawings of mechanisms include part of a silk-spinning wheel, a fulling mill for the cloth industry, and a large circular mill with four pairs of cogwheel lanterns. Antonio also sketched new mechanisms that he imagined such as a gristmill powered by horses moving a tread wheel and another drawing shows a tread wheel mechanism that drives four mills simultaneously with a single shaft and two men.

== Military projects ==

Sangallo was also a noted military architect, working on the fortifications of numerous cities such as Parma, Piacenza, Ancona and Orvieto. [previous sentence not changed but added citation] One of the most significant projects for Antonio’s career was to design and build the Fortezza da Basso in 1534. Sangallo the Younger almost completed the project in two years for the new Imperial Duke of Florence, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici. Military construction was a different type of architecture that required strong fortifications and a vast labor force to excavate ditches and transport the materials. The fortifications that Sangallo designed were built to resist the cannonballs and explosive mines that could negatively impact the structural integrity of the building. Antonio gained the skills of designing and coordinating the logistics of hundreds of skilled and unskilled workers to build the complex network of spaces inside the military fortresses.

==Work on the Vatican and Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica==
Sangallo had maintained a good relationship with the popes, and thus was involved in the designing and building process of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica until at least 1536. Previously, the Basilica was entrusted to Antonio&#x27;s uncle, Giuliano da Sangallo. It was after the sack of Rome that Antonio da Sangallo was responsible for its undertaking, with construction of the Basilica beginning in April 1506. As &quot;capomaestro&quot;, Sangallo was in charge of the day-to-day construction of the basilica for many years. Antonio collaborated with Donato Bramante, Raphael Sanzio, and Baldassarre Peruzzi to design the Basilica. He also created a design for the basilica, of which a wooden model exists today. After Antonio died in 1546, Michelangelo became the chief architect.

Sangallo also worked extensively on the Vatican apartments, building the Pauline Chapel, the Sala Regia which serves as the entryway to the Sistine Chapel. He also worked on the Scala Regia, the staircase that serves as the main entrance to the Apostolic Palace. Vasari also claims that Sangallo modified the Sistine Chapel by elevating the roof, although exactly what the modifications are is unclear.

==Death and legacy==
Sangallo&#x27;s final project was on the Rieti Valley, which had been commissioned to him by Pope Paul III. After working in the marshy environment, Sangallo contracted malaria and died in 1546 before finishing his work. Sangallo is buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica with the following epitaph:

&lt;poem&gt;
: ANTONIO SANCTI GALLI FLORENTINO, URBE MUNIENDA AC PUB.
:OPERIBUS, PRAECIPUEQUE D. PETRI TEMPLO ORNAN. ARCHITECTORUM
:FACILE PRINCIPI, DUM VELINI LACUS EMISSIONEM PARAT, PAULO PONT.
:MAX. AUCTORE, INTERAMNAE INTEMPESTIVE EXTINCTO ISABELLA DETA
:UXOR MOESTISS. POSUIT 1546, III. CALEND. OCTOBRIS.
&lt;/poem&gt;

His biographer Vasari writes, ″In truth Antonio, who was a most excellent architect, deserves to be celebrated and extolled, as his works clearly demonstrate, no less than any other architect, whether ancient or modern.″ As an architect, his legacy can be seen through the buildings he worked on, especially as they inspired future architectural methods. His existing drawings serve as insight for other architects who can hope to learn from his architectural forms.

<text>Grenville Turner (1 November 1936 – 22 August 2024) was a British geochemist who was a research professor at the University of Manchester. He was one of the pioneers of cosmochemistry.

== Education ==
* Todmorden Grammar School
* St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (MA)
* Balliol College, Oxford

In 1962, he was awarded his D.Phil. (Oxford University&#x27;s equivalent of a PhD) in nuclear physics.

== Career ==
* University of California, Berkeley: assistant professor, 1962–64
* University of Sheffield: lecturer in physics, 1964–74, senior lecturer 1974–79, reader 1979–80, professor 1980–88
* Caltech: research associate, 1970–71
* University of Manchester: professor of isotope geochemistry, Department of Earth Sciences, 1988–
* Member of committees for SERC, the British National Space Centre and PPARC

== Scientific work ==
Turner was a leading figure in cosmochemistry since the 1960s. His pioneering work on rare gases in meteorites led him to develop the argon–argon dating technique that demonstrated the great age of meteorites and provided a precise chronology of rocks brought back by the Apollo missions. He was one of the few UK scientists to be a Principal Investigator of these Apollo samples.

His argon-dating technique involved stepped pyrolysis of the rocks to force out the argon, then determining the isotopic ratios in the gas by mass spectrometry. This was later refined by the use of lasers. These techniques have been invaluable to cosmochemists and geochemists, and have been applied (by Turner and others) to determine the geochronology of diamonds and inclusions in them, and the precise ages of mantle and crustal rocks from the Earth.

He went on to develop even better techniques, such as iodine-xenon chronology. He used laser resonance ionisation of xenon to measure samples with only a few thousand atoms of xenon; this enabled him to get accurate data from tiny samples, including individual chondrules. He could even trace secondary processes, such as alteration by heat, fluids or shock.

Turner set up the first ion microprobe in the United Kingdom intended for use primarily for examining extraterrestrial material. He used it to measure oxygen-isotope variations in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. His results cast light on the environment in which the carbonate grains and so-called microfossils in that meteorite formed.

He was a founder member of the UK Cosmochemical Analysis Network, a network of laboratories in research institutions that analyse extraterrestrial material.

He continued to be an active researcher during retirement. In 2004, he announced a plutonium-xenon technique for dating terrestrial materials.

== Death ==
Turner died in Sheffield on 22 August 2024, at the age of 87, after being diagnosed with grade IV astrocytoma in 2022.

== Honours and awards ==
*Fellow of the Royal Society, 1980 (member of Council 1990–92)
*Fellow, Meteoritical Society, 1980

<text>Claude Marie Jules Bourcier (19 February 1797 – 9 March 1873) was a French naturalist and expert on hummingbirds.

Bourcier was born in Cuisery, Saône-et-Loire. He was the mayor of Millery, Rhône from 1832 to 1837, and he was the French consul to Ecuador from 1849 to 1850. In 1857, he became a corresponding member of the &quot;Société linnéenne de Lyon&quot;.

Bourcier named a number of new hummingbird species, either alone or with other ornithologists, such as Adolphe Delattre and Martial Etienne Mulsant.

The following hummingbird species bear his name:
*Colibri de Bourcier (&quot;Polyonymus caroli&quot;), described by Bourcier in 1847;
*&quot;Phaethornis bourcieri&quot;, described by René Primevère Lesson in 1832.

A species of South American snake, &quot;Saphenophis boursieri&quot;, was named in his honor by Giorgio Jan in 1867. The terrestrial mollusk genus Bourciera was named after him, based on specimens he collected for Louis Pfeiffer.

He died in Batignolles, Paris, in 1873.

<doc id="991684" wikidata="Q5223193" url="?curid=991684" title="Dark Days (film)">
<text>Dark Days is an American documentary film directed, produced, and photographed by the English documentarian Marc Singer that was completed and released in 2000. Shot during the mid-1990s, it follows a group of people who lived in the Freedom Tunnel section of the Amtrak system at the time. DJ Shadow created new music for the documentary and also let Singer use some of his preexisting songs.

==Background==
When Marc Singer arrived in Manhattan, he was struck by the number of people he saw living on the streets. He befriended many in New York&#x27;s homeless community and, after hearing about people who lived underground in abandoned tunnel systems, he met and became close to some members of the Freedom Tunnel community, which stretched north from Penn Station past Harlem. After living in the tunnel on and off for a number of months, Singer decided to create a documentary, even though he had never made a film before, hoping that the project would make enough money for the residents of the tunnel to move into better housing.

==Production==
The filming took two-and-a-half years. The film&#x27;s crew consisted of the subjects themselves, who rigged up makeshift lighting and dollies and learned to use a 16mm camera with black-and-white film.

During filming, Amtrak announced it would be forcibly evicting the people living in the tunnels in order to reroute their trains through the tunnel. This announcement, plus the police presence backing the decision, prompted Singer and photographer Margaret Morton to go to the Coalition for the Homeless for help. Eventually, Singer and Morton managed to secure housing vouchers from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the film&#x27;s subjects, which enabled them to move out of the tunnels and into their own apartments.

The post-production process for the film took years, with delays caused by financial difficulties and Singer&#x27;s insistence on creative control to protect the tunnel residents. Melissa Neidich was the editor of the film.

==Soundtrack==
The film features music by DJ Shadow. Included in the score are excerpts from &quot;Endtroducing...&quot; and his album with Unkle, as well as original music he composed for the main theme of the film, which was released on the single &quot;Dark Days&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Dark Days&quot; was released in 2000. It won three awards at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival (Audience Award Documentary, Excellence in Cinematography Award: Documentary, and Freedom of Expression Award), was chosen as the Senior Programmer&#x27;s Pick at the 2000 SXSW Film Awards, and was nominated for awards at several other film festivals. The film also won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film.

===Tenth anniversary re-release===
Oscilloscope Laboratories re-released &quot;Dark Days&quot; theatrically at Cinema Village in New York City on July 1, 2011, as well as on DVD on July 19, 2011. The DVD contains several new features compiled especially for the special tenth anniversary release, including footage of Singer revisiting the Freedom Tunnel in 2011 and a &quot;where are they now&quot; video that details what happened to the tunnel residents after the documentary was filmed. The film was re-released by Dogwoof Pictures in the U.K., with the home video release including the additional features and interviews.

<text>Rock Against Bush was a project mobilizing punk and alternative musicians against the 2004 U.S. Presidential re-election campaign of George W. Bush. At its core was the idea of using music to create an anti-war, pro-peace sentiment, similar to counterculture music movements of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Woodstock. The effort inspired Australian punk bands to start Rock Against Howard.

The effort was initiated by Fat Mike (Michael Burkett) of the band NOFX and punk music label Fat Wreck Chords, inspired by the Rock Against Reagan campaign of the early 1980s. It included live concerts, a series of compilation albums, and is associated with the Punkvoter website. Its goal was to encourage people, especially punk fans, to register to vote and to oppose Bush. The album proceeds were used to support a 2004 concert tour and an associated voter registration drive, emphasizing the swing states. The effort did not achieve its goal, as George W. Bush went on to win the election. The albums have been issued by the Fat Wreck Chords label, which focuses on skate punk and pop punk artists, so most of the songs are by similar themed bands. Both a CD and a DVD were included, the latter containing documentaries critical of Bush, music videos, and comedy.

==Reception and criticisms==
Green Day drummer Tré Cool has said Rock Against Bush is a &quot;a pretty damn good CD&quot; and that there are &quot;some older bands on there that are still going strong and some younger bands that are real fresh and exciting too.&quot;.

Rock Against Bush and Punkvoter were subject to criticism on multiple fronts. A similar (but more obscure) project was started by conservative punks called &quot;Crush Kerry&quot;. In addition, more radical punks (especially anarchists) criticized the emphasis on electoral politics, as well as the tacit endorsement of John Kerry, who they believed was not much better than George W. Bush. The band Propagandhi decided not to participate when Fat Mike requested that they change the lyrics of a song critical of George Soros that they wished to contribute.

T-shirts were also printed, depicting Fat Mike with the text &quot;Not My Political Advisor&quot;, as a parody of the &quot;Not My President&quot; shirts that depicted Bush, issued by Fat Mike. Fat Mike himself stated he found this to be &quot;pretty funny&quot;.

<text>Kevin George Knipfing (born April 26, 1965), known professionally as Kevin James, is an American comedian and actor. He began his career by performing stand-up comedy at clubs on Long Island in the 1980s. He rose to prominence for his portrayal of Doug Heffernan on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (1998–2007), for which he received the nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006.

In 2004, James made his first film appearance in &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, and the following year co-starred in &quot;Hitch&quot; with Will Smith. He went on to star in &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; (2007), &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&quot; (2009), &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (2010), &quot;Zookeeper&quot; (2011), &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot; (2012), and &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015). He has also done voice work for &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot; (both 2006), and the first three films of the &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; franchise (2012–2018). He also was nominated for a People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2017 for his role on the CBS sitcom &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot; (2016–2018). James has also appeared in several dramatic roles, including &quot;The Dilemma&quot; (2011), &quot;Little Boy&quot; (2015), and &quot;Becky&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Kevin George Knipfing was born in Mineola, New York, on April 26, 1965, to office worker Janet Klein and insurance agency owner Joseph Valentine Knipfing Jr. He is of German, Ashkenazi Jewish, Sephardic Jewish, &amp; Italian ancestry. He grew up in Stony Brook, New York. He has a sister named Leslie and an older brother named Gary, who also became a comedian and actor (adopting the stage name Gary Valentine). The siblings were raised Catholic. James graduated from Ward Melville High School, where he reached the top position on the wrestling team, one spot above his friend and future professional wrestler Mick Foley. Both wrestled in the Heavyweight weight class. When James suffered a season-ending back injury, Foley took over the first string position. Both men went on to study at the State University of New York at Cortland, where James played halfback on the varsity football team until another back injury permanently ended his sporting ambitions.

==Career==
===Stand-up===
James began doing stand-up comedy in 1989, making his debut at Richie Minervini&#x27;s East Side Comedy Club on Long Island. He also started performing comedy with a troupe at the club, during which time he adopted &quot;James&quot; as his stage surname in honor of his favorite school teacher. He gained popularity through numerous appearances on various talk shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;.

James has also done his stand-up routine on &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;, an annual comedy festival in Montreal, Quebec. Later he was on commercials for Mazzio&#x27;s Italian Eatery. In 2001, James did his own stand-up special called &quot;Kevin James: Sweat the Small Stuff&quot;. He has also appeared as a musical guest on &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;. In 2018, James released another stand-up special on Netflix called &quot;Kevin James: Never Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. In 2024, James released his third special on Amazon Prime Video called &quot;Kevin James: Irregardless&quot;.

===Television===
James&#x27; first television job was in 1991 on &quot;The New Candid Camera&quot;, where he used his comedy timing and improvisation skills playing the actor that pulled practical jokes on unsuspecting people. He appeared in &quot;A&amp;E&#x27;s An Evening at the Improv&quot; in 1994. James appeared on television as the announcer for the MTV sports game show &quot;SandBlast&quot; from 1994 to 1996.

James later moved to Los Angeles and befriended Ray Romano, and he guest-starred on a few episodes of Romano&#x27;s hit CBS sitcom, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. These appearances led to the development of his own sitcom, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, which ran on CBS from September 21, 1998, to May 14, 2007, James played working class parcel delivery man Doug Heffernan who works for a company known as IPS. He is married to Carrie (Leah Remini), a sharp-tongued, ambitious secretary at a Manhattan law firm who is far less content with working-class life in Queens. Her obsessive, vindictive father, Arthur (Jerry Stiller), who is prone toward bizarre conduct, lives with them. For his work on the eighth season, James was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006.

James hosted the 2010 Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards on March 27, 2010. He was nominated to be the inaugural member of the &quot;Arm Fart Hall of Fame&quot; in the following year&#x27;s show, with host Jack Black calling him Kevin &quot;Not-Quite-As-Good-As-Me&quot; James. He and fellow nominee Kaley Cuoco lost in fan voting to Josh Duhamel.

James starred in the sitcom &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot;, which premiered on September 19, 2016. The series was renewed for a second season, before being canceled at the season&#x27;s end.

In 2021, James released a new show on Netflix called &quot;The Crew&quot;. It was canceled after one season.

James is set to portray John Daly, in the upcoming series.

===Film===

After a cameo in &quot;50 First Dates&quot; in 2004, James made his starring film debut in the 2005 romantic comedy &quot;Hitch&quot;, alongside Will Smith and Eva Mendes. In 2006, he co-starred with his &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; colleague Ray Romano in the straight-to-video comedy &quot;Grilled&quot;, and provided voice work in the animated films &quot;Monster House&quot; and &quot;Barnyard&quot;, released on July 21 and August 4, respectively, of that year. James co-starred with Adam Sandler in the comedies &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; (2007) and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; (2008), and starred in the Sandler-produced comedy &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&quot; (2009). The latter film opened as the No. 1 film in North America with a weekend gross of $39 million, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, and eventually grossed $219 million from ticket and home video sales. James also appeared in &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (2010), which co-starred numerous &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni and was even more universally panned, yet was highly successful at the box office and led to a sequel in 2013.

In 2011, he had a lead role with Vince Vaughn in the comedy-drama &quot;The Dilemma&quot; and then with Rosario Dawson in &quot;Zookeeper&quot;, which he wrote and produced. James also had the lead role in the 2012 mixed martial arts comedy film &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot;. He starred as well in the movie &quot;Pixels&quot; in 2015 and the following year in &quot;True Memoirs of an International Assassin&quot;, directed by Jeff Wadlow and released by Netflix on November 11, 2016. In 2017, James co-starred with Adam Sandler in another Netflix film, &quot;Sandy Wexler&quot;.

James had a lead dramatic role in the 2020 thriller film &quot;Becky&quot;. He starred as NFL head coach Sean Payton in the 2022 biographical film &quot;Home Team&quot;. As 2024, James is set to appear three comedy films, including &quot;Guns Up&quot;, Playdate and Solo Mio.

===Other work===
In 2007, he was the grand marshal for the Pepsi 400 promoting &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; and saying &quot;Gentlemen, start your engines&quot;. He did it again in June 2010 with friend and fellow actor Adam Sandler to promote &quot;Grown Ups&quot;, in 2012 at the fall Talladega race to promote &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot;, and in July 2013 at the Coke-Zero 400 with co-stars Sandler and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to promote &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;. Both the 2007 Pepsi 400 command and June 2010 command at Michigan with Sandler have since been voted as two of the best and most memorable NASCAR commands in history by fans.

A web series titled &quot;Dusty Peacock&quot; produced by James and starring his brother Gary Valentine began streaming on Crackle in July 2009.

In February 2020, James revived his YouTube channel which he had launched back on November 27, 2017 featuring short films &quot;based on thin premises, like James eagerly waiting for a green light, misreading a hand wave, or spending birthdays by himself, but many carry a sense of melancholy and restraint.&quot; By June 2020, he had over 535,000 subscribers and 28 million total views.

==Personal life==

James met actress Steffiana de la Cruz as part of a blind date, and they were married on June 19, 2004. They have four children together and reside in California.

James is a fan of the New York Mets baseball team, throwing out the first pitch at a game in August 2024.

Raised in a Catholic home, James stated in 2012 that he remains a devout Catholic. In 2019, he hosted a Catholic retreat featuring priest Chad Ripperger and theologian Scott Hahn.

<doc id="991713" wikidata="Q650928" url="?curid=991713" title="Parris Glendening">
<text>Parris Nelson Glendening (born June 11, 1942) is an American politician and academic who served as the 59th governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003. He previously served as the county executive of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland from 1982 to 1994 as a member of the Democratic Party. In 1999, Glendening was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Glendening was born in The Bronx, New York City, but later in his youth moved to the state of Florida. Raised Catholic, he attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale. He won a financial scholarship to Broward Community College.

Other financial aid later enabled him to attend the Florida State University, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree (1964), a master&#x27;s degree (1965), and a PhD (1967), becoming the youngest student in FSU history to receive a doctorate in political science.

When he graduated, he taught government and politics as a professor at the University of Maryland at College Park for 27 years. In 1977, he co-authored &quot;Pragmatic Federalism: An Intergovernmental View of American Government&quot; with Mavis Mann Reeves.

==Local politics==
Glendening&#x27;s career in public service began in 1973 as a city councilman in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Hyattsville, Maryland. He was elected to the county council of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, in 1974 and twice served as the council chairman. In 1982, he was elected as the county executive of Prince George&#x27;s county, eventually becoming the first county executive in Maryland history to be elected to three terms (1982–94). Under Glendening&#x27;s leadership, Prince George&#x27;s county was selected as an &quot;All America County&quot; by the National Civic League, and &quot;City and State Magazine&quot; named him the &quot;most valuable county official&quot; in the nation. He and his top aides stood to benefit from a controversial Prince George&#x27;s county supplemental retirement plan that was not widely disclosed by the press until after he was elected governor in an extremely close contest.

==Governor of Maryland==
===Elections===
Glendening was elected to his first term as governor of Maryland, edging out Ellen Sauerbrey, the Republican nominee, by 5,993 votes. Sauerbrey challenged the result in Maryland circuit court claiming that widespread voting by dead people occurred in the African American community. No evidence of ballots cast in the names of dead voters was introduced in court. On the eve of the trial, Sauerbrey&#x27;s attorneys talked of 89 such votes, but checking by reporters found no such ballots. Judge Raymond G. Thieme Jr. ruled against Sauerbrey&#x27;s claim and certified Glendening&#x27;s win. Glendening became the first Maryland governor elected from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region since Oden Bowie was elected in 1867. In 1998, Glendening won re-election to a second term, again defeating Sauerbrey, this time 55% to 45%.

===Tenure===

Glendening&#x27;s early administration was marked by higher education investment, environmental protection, tax reform and economic development. From 1994 to 1998, he cut or lowered more than 50 Maryland taxes, including the state personal income tax. By the end of his first term, Maryland&#x27;s national rank in job creation had moved from 43rd to 14th. Glendening&#x27;s job creation efforts focused mainly on biotechnology. Seeking to make Maryland a world leader in this area, Glendening successfully recruited companies such as Human Genome Sciences, Gallow Lab, and Qiagen to Maryland. As of June 2014, Maryland was home to the second-largest biotech cluster per capita in the U.S.

Glendening also assisted in successfully bringing the National Football League teams Washington Redskins from Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in the neighboring District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) who now play in a new stadium in Landover, with then owner Jack Kent Cooke, and the relocated franchise Baltimore Ravens, from Cleveland, Ohio, as the former Cleveland Browns with owner Art Modell to play in Baltimore after two years in a new stadium as part of the sports complex at Camden Yards, west of the redeveloped Inner Harbor. Glendening personally negotiated the relocation agreements with both owners and then undertook a politically heated battle against members of his own party – led by state senator Chris Van Hollen (future representative and senator) – to build the teams&#x27; new stadiums and pay for the needed road improvements and public works infrastructure.

During Glendening&#x27;s second term, serious ongoing environmental issues concerning the Chesapeake Bay and the overdevelopment of rural areas increased his focus on issues of growth and environmental stewardship. Glendening is widely recognized as a pioneer in land development issues and is credited for coining the phrase &quot;Smart Growth.&quot;

In 2001, Maryland legislators passed a bill that Glendening had promoted for the previous two years banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Glendening signed the bill.

Though overseeing the executions of Flint Gregory Hunt in 1997 and Tyrone Delano Gilliam Jr. in 1998, Glendening halted executions in Maryland by an executive order on May 9, 2002. Glendening&#x27;s successor, Robert Ehrlich, lifted the ban during his term in office. The ban was re-instituted by Ehrlich&#x27;s successor, former Baltimore mayor, Martin O&#x27;Malley, who eventually signed a bill in 2013 ending Maryland&#x27;s use of capital punishment. During the 2002 Maryland gubernatorial election, Glendening was not eligible to run due to the state constitutional term limit. His lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, was nominated by the Democrats to run. Townsend was damaged during the election due to wide criticism by rural voters, especially farmers, directed at Glendening for what they considered overzealous environmental legislation aimed at preventing rain runoff of pollutants from farm soils into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, that significantly raised the cost of participating in agribusiness.

Townsend lost the election, 48%–52%, to the Republican U.S. representative Robert Ehrlich of Arbutus. Ehrlich ran an inclusive campaign focusing on his bipartisan work in Congress and his pro-choice stance on abortion and moderate voting record. His efforts resulted in record voter turnout in Maryland&#x27;s rural and suburban counties. At the same time, Townsend&#x27;s campaign was plagued with missteps emblematic of which was her unpopular lieutenant governor choice, retired admiral Charles R. Larson, who had never been involved in politics and had changed parties only weeks before. Townsend&#x27;s selection of Larson, which she made without consulting the Democratic leaders in the state, was a point of controversy in the campaign.
Ehrlich was victorious in November 2002, taking office in the Maryland State House in Annapolis in January 2003.

==Post political career==
Glendening left office on January 15, 2003, with low approval ratings, and he largely stayed out of the limelight. He and his successor, Robert Ehrlich, informally agreed not to criticize one another. Glendening quietly continued his advocacy work for Smart Growth.

Glendening broke his three-and-a-half-year silence in late August 2006, when he endorsed Kweisi Mfume for the U.S. Senate. Mfume eventually lost the Democratic primary to Representative Ben Cardin, who went on to win the Senate seat replacing longtime incumbent Paul Sarbanes.

Glendening did not attend the inauguration of governor Martin O&#x27;Malley on January 17, 2007 because he was out of town on a pre-planned speaking engagement.

==Personal life==
On November 19, 2001, Glendening divorced Frances Hughes Glendening. He married Jennifer Crawford, his third wife, on January 25, 2002. At the time of their marriage, Crawford was 35 and Glendening was 59. They have a daughter, born in August 2002, marking the first time since 1879 that a Maryland governor had a baby born during his term of office.

Glendening&#x27;s brother, Bruce, died of AIDS in 1992.

Glendening regards University Park, Maryland, as his hometown, near the University of Maryland at College Park campus.

<text>Gábor István Szabó (March 8, 1936 – February 26, 1982) was a Hungarian-American guitarist whose style incorporated jazz, pop, rock, and Hungarian music.

==Early years==
Szabó was born in Budapest, Hungary. He began playing guitar at the age of 14. In the aftermath of the Hungarian revolution of 1956, he moved to California and later attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston between 1958 and 1960.

In a 1974 interview, Szabo said he fell in love with jazz listening to Voice of America: &quot;I had to listen to the jazz stations very quietly at night--if they were not jammed--because listening to music from the Western world was an offense against the government.&quot; When the Soviet Union militarily suppressed Hungarian insurgents, Szabo was twenty. He escaped
to an Austrian refugee camp, later emigrating to San Bernardino. He found it challenging to break into jazz. He formed a trio with two other refugees. It failed; he worked as a janitor for a year. &quot;By then I had saved enough money to study at the Berklee School of Music in
Boston. And in 1958, I played at Newport (R.I.) with the International Band.&quot;

==Career==
In 1961, Szabó became member of a quintet that was led by Chico Hamilton and included Charles Lloyd, playing what has been described as chamber jazz, with &quot;a moderate avant-gardism.&quot; Szabó was influenced by the rock music of the 1960s, particularly the use of feedback. In 1965 he was in a jazz pop group led by Gary McFarland, then worked again with Lloyd in an energetic quartet with Ron Carter and Tony Williams. The song &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; from Szabó&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Spellbinder&quot; became a hit for rock guitarist Carlos Santana. During the late 1960s, Szabó worked in a group with guitarist Jimmy Stewart. He started the label Skye Records with McFarland and Cal Tjader.

He composed the score for the Roman Polanski film Repulsion in 1965.

Szabó continued to be drawn to more popular, commercial music in the 1970s. He performed often in California, combining elements of Gypsy and Indian music with jazz. In the 1970s he began to return occasionally to his home country of Hungary to perform, after more than twenty years absence.

==Personal life==

Szabo divorced his wife Alicia in 1978. They had one son, Blaise. Szabo became involved with Marianne Almassey, a Hungarian model. They remained together until Szabo’s death in 1982.

In the late 1970s, Szabo sought drug treatment for a serious, long-standing heroin addiction dating back to his days with Chico Hamilton. He enrolled in Narcanon, a treatment center run by the Church of Scientology. He signed with Vanguard Artists International, a Scientology-related firm led at the time by Chick Corea, in November 1978. By February 1980, Szabo had become alienated from Scientology, telling friends “they’re turning me into a zombie.” He accused the church and Artists International of physical abuse, misappropriating his money and mismanaging his career.

Szabo filed a $21 million lawsuit against the Church of Scientology, accusing the organization of embezzling his money, kidnapping him and forcing him to undergo a Scientology &quot;Life Repair Course.&quot; Szabo accused the church of inducing him to sign with Artists International, alleging that the firm was inept and more concerned with using his name to win converts to Scientology. He said Artists International charged him 26 percent of his gross income, and embezzled at least $15,000 from him. The suit was settled the next year.

==Death==
While visiting family in Budapest during the Christmas holiday, Szabó was admitted to the hospital and finally succumbed to the liver and kidney ailments he suffered from as a consequence of his drug habit. He died on February 26, 1982, shortly before his 46th birthday. He was buried next to his mother in Farkasréti Cemetery.

<text>The 1926 Canadian federal election was held on September 14, 1926, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 16th Parliament of Canada. The election was called after an event known as the King–Byng affair.

In the 1925 federal election, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party of Canada had won fewer seats in the House of Commons of Canada than the Conservatives of Arthur Meighen. King, however, was determined to continue to govern with the support of the Progressive Party. The combined Liberal and Progressive caucuses gave Mackenzie King a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, and the ability to form a minority government.
The agreement collapsed, however, after a scandal, and King approached the governor general of Canada, Baron Byng of Vimy, to seek dissolution of the Parliament. Byng refused on the basis that the Conservatives had won the most seats in the prior election and so he called upon Meighen to form a government.

Prime Minister Meighen&#x27;s government was soon defeated in a vote of non-confidence, and Byng agreed to Meighen&#x27;s request to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. King effectively campaigned against Byng, instead of against Meighen, in the election and won the most seats in the House of Commons although his party received fewer votes than the Conservatives. However, this may have been largely because the Liberals did not run candidates in all ridings - they had an informal electoral pact with the Progressives and Liberal-Progressives. 

As well, Conservatives suffered from disproportional transition from votes to seats. In particular, in Manitoba Meighen&#x27;s party captured almost 40 percent of the vote, twice the vote share of any other party, but no seats.

King&#x27;s Liberals did not take a marjoty of seats but were able to govern with the support of Liberal-Progressive Members of Parliament.

The Progressive Party&#x27;s Albertan legislators left the party and instead sought re-election under the United Farmers of Alberta banner. At the time, the UFA formed the government in Alberta. They won eleven seats in Alberta, an increase of nine from the previous year and the same number the Progressives won elsewhere. The Progressives&#x27; seat count was halved compared to 1925, although when viewed in its totality the election result can also be regarded as a combined net decrease of two seats for the Progressives and UFA.

Byng returned to Britain at the end of the year and was raised to the rank of viscount as an expression of confidence in him. After his party&#x27;s defeat and the loss of his seat, Meighen resigned as Conservative leader.

<doc id="991720" wikidata="Q242580" url="?curid=991720" title="Leah Remini">
<text>Leah Marie Remini (; born June 15, 1970) is an American actress. She starred as Carrie Heffernan on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (1998–2007) and as Vanessa Celluci in the CBS sitcom &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot; (2017–2018), both alongside Kevin James.

Remini coproduced and hosted the A&amp;E documentary series &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot; (2016–2019), for which she won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special. She also cohosted the daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot; (2010–2011). Remini&#x27;s films include the comedy &quot;Old School&quot; (2003), the mystery comedy &quot;Handsome&quot; (2017), and the romantic comedy &quot;Second Act&quot; (2018).

After being a member of the Church of Scientology from childhood, Remini left the organization in 2013. Two years later, Remini released her book, &quot;&quot;; the memoir became number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In 2016, she followed up with an Emmy Award-winning documentary television series on A&amp;E, &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot;, where she created a platform for victims and survivors of Scientology. Since July 2020, Remini has been the cohost of the podcast &quot;Scientology: Fair Game&quot;, alongside Mike Rinder.

==Early life==
Remini was born on June 15, 1970, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Vicki Marshall and George Remini, who owned an asbestos removal company. Her mother is of Austrian Jewish descent, while her father has Italian ancestry, rooted in Sicily. Remini was raised in Bensonhurst.

Remini was baptized into the Catholic Church as an infant and raised in the faith during her early childhood. When she was 8, her mother joined the Church of Scientology, and Remini was thereafter raised as a Scientologist. At 13, Remini and her sister were taken to join Scientology&#x27;s Paramilitary organization called the Sea Organization, where they were forced to sign billion-year contracts and work for their room and board.

Remini&#x27;s mother decided to take her children out of the Sea Org and return to civilian Scientology life within the same year. Remini moved to Los Angeles, with her mother and sisters, where she spent the remainder of her teenage years working to pay off their debt to Scientology for all of their auditing received. In addition, Remini and her family worked regular jobs to pay for continuing Scientology courses and services.

==Career==
===Film and television===
One of Remini&#x27;s early television roles was on &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; as Charlie Briscoe, which led to a spin-off series entitled &quot;Living Dolls&quot;, in which Remini starred with Halle Berry. The show premiered in late 1989 and ran for twelve episodes. In 1991, Remini had a supporting role as Tina Bovasso on ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Man in the Family&quot;. She then had recurring roles on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; playing Stacey Carosi, and on &quot;Evening Shade&quot; as Taylor Newton&#x27;s (Jay R. Ferguson) girlfriend, Daisy. Remini then appeared in two more short-lived series, &quot;First Time Out&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fired Up&quot; (1997–98). 

In 1991 and 1993, she appeared on &quot;Cheers&quot; as Serafina, the daughter of Carla and Nick Tortelli (Rhea Perlman and Dan Hedaya). In 1994, Remini auditioned for the role of Monica Geller on &quot;Friends&quot;, but the role went to Courteney Cox. Remini later appeared in the 1995 &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with the Birth&quot; in which she played a pregnant woman, Lydia, whose delivery is aided by Joey Tribbiani. In 1998, Remini landed the role of Carrie Heffernan on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. The series was successful, and ran for nine seasons from September 21, 1998, to May 14, 2007. During her time on the show, she starred in Quaker State&#x27;s television commercials in 2000 and 2001.

Remini had a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Old School&quot; (2003). She also starred in her own reality show, &quot;Inside Out: Leah Remini&quot;, which was a documentary that aired on VH1 about Remini&#x27;s wedding. Following the success of the wedding special, VH1 documented the next phase of their lives with the birth of her daughter Sofia Bella. Remini has starred in nine-episode webisodes of &quot;In the Motherhood&quot;, along with Chelsea Handler and Jenny McCarthy, and made two guest appearances on Handler&#x27;s talk show &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;. On December 15, 2009, Remini appeared as Heffernan on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; with George Lopez in an episode reuniting the cast of the &quot;George Lopez&quot; sitcom. Remini and Holly Robinson Peete appeared on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; on July 28, 2011.

In October 2011, Remini signed a talent development deal at ABC and ABC Studios that required the network and the studio to develop a comedy project for Remini to star in and produce. Remini competed on season 17 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, in which she was partnered with professional dancer Tony Dovolani. The couple made it to the tenth week of competition and reached fifth place. Remini later returned in season 19 as a guest co-host on week six. She returned as guest co-host on season 21 during weeks six and seven. In 2013, Remini joined the cast of the TV Land comedy &quot;The Exes&quot;, filling a recurring role starting in season 3. Remini created, produced and starred in a reality television series titled &quot;Leah Remini: It&#x27;s All Relative&quot;. The show focuses on Remini&#x27;s family life and it premiered on TLC on July 10, 2014.

In early 2017, Remini returned to acting and was announced as one of the leads in NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;What About Barb?&quot;, a gender-swapped version of the 1991 Frank Oz comedy &quot;What About Bob?&quot;. She portrayed Suzanne, a renowned psychotherapist and best-selling author. Ultimately, NBC passed on the project and it wasn&#x27;t picked up to series. In March 2017, it was announced Remini would reunite with Kevin James on the season finale of &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot;. In June 2017, it was announced Remini was upped to a series regular beginning with season 2. In May 2018, the series was cancelled by the network after two seasons. In 2017, Remini co-starred in the comedy films &quot;Mad Families&quot;, &quot;The Clapper&quot;, and &quot;Handsome&quot;. In 2018, she starred as Joan, opposite Jennifer Lopez, in the romantic comedy film &quot;Second Act&quot;. In June 2022, Remini was named a judge on the seventeenth season of Fox&#x27;s dance competition series &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, replacing Matthew Morrison. Remini began 2021 as the host of the Game Show Network original series &quot;People Puzzler&quot;.

==== &quot;The Talk&quot; ====
Remini was a co-host in the first season of the CBS daytime talk show, &quot;The Talk&quot;, which premiered October 18, 2010. The other co-hosts were Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert, Holly Robinson Peete, and Sharon Osbourne. The show, similar to &quot;The View&quot;, seeks to address motherhood and contemporary issues. In March 2012, a heavily publicized Twitter dispute ignited between Remini and Osbourne when Remini fired back at Osbourne, Osbourne making criticisms of Remini and Peete on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in relation to their contracts not being renewed for &quot;The Talk&quot;. In response to questions from her Twitter followers, Remini tweeted:

In response, Osbourne tweeted, &quot;I had absolutely nothing to do with her departure from the show and have no idea why she continues to take to Twitter to spread this false gossip.&quot; Remini tweeted a challenge to Osbourne to establish in a court of law what statements Remini had made that were untrue.

Friction in relation to these matters resurfaced in the media in early 2021 when Osbourne was embroiled in a scandal over her remarks made on &quot;The Talk&quot; to Sheryl Underwood and ultimately terminated from the program over them. Both Peete and Remini took to social media to reproach Osbourne over her conduct in relation to the scandal, pointing out that they had been treated similarly by her, charging Osbourne with additional discriminatory behaviors as well. Osbourne responded with threats of defamation lawsuits against Peete and Remini, but ultimately did nothing.

====&quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot;====
Remini developed a series for A&amp;E focusing on ex-Scientologists speaking about their experiences, entitled &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot;. The show premiered November 29, 2016. In a statement released by the network, Remini said:

The documentary series received many awards in its three seasons: two Emmys, Reality Television Awards 2017 for hosting, 2018 NATPE Unscripted Breakthrough Awards for Best Innovation, 2019 Truth to Power Award, CHILD USA 2019 Barbara Blaine Trailblazer Award, and two Gracie Awards presented by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (for On-Air Talent – Lifestyle and Entertainment and for Non-Fiction Entertainment).

===Memoir===
Remini released her memoir, entitled &quot;&quot;, on November 3, 2015. The book received favorable reviews, and became a bestseller shortly after its release, reaching the number one spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Personal life==
===Scientology===
Remini was a member of the Church of Scientology from the age of 9. In July 2013, Remini left Scientology, owing to policies that forbid members from questioning the management of Church leader David Miscavige, which she believed was corrupt; the reported abuse of members of its Sea Org religious order; its policy of &quot;disconnection&quot;; and its practice of branding those who have left the Church of their own accord as &quot;suppressive persons&quot; and the fair gaming tactics that Scientology has used for decades.

According to former high-ranking Sea Org member Mike Rinder, Remini&#x27;s problems with Scientology began when she asked about the whereabouts of Miscavige&#x27;s wife Shelly at the 2006 wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and was told by then-spokesman Tommy Davis that she did not &quot;have the fucking rank&quot; to do so. Remini then filed a &quot;knowledge report&quot; in which she asserted that Miscavige, Cruise, and other senior Scientology members engaged in behavior that was inconsistent with Church rules. She was subsequently &quot;subjected to years of &#x27;interrogations&#x27; and &#x27;thought modification&#x27;&quot; that led to her being blackballed within Scientology. Fellow parishioners with whom Remini had been friends for decades wrote internal reports about her, resulting in a Church investigation into her family.

During a September 9, 2013, appearance on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, Remini discussed her departure from Scientology and the loss of friends who are still in the Church who, according to Remini, are not permitted to have contact with her. Following her departure from Scientology, she publicly expressed her appreciation for those who supported her departure. Remini&#x27;s sister Nicole, who had earlier left Scientology, revealed that the rest of their family left the Church along with Remini to avoid being split up by the disconnection policy. Writer and director Paul Haggis, who had previously been the most famous person to publicly disavow Scientology, wrote an open letter, published by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, thanking Remini for standing by him after he left Scientology and praised her &quot;enormous amount of integrity and compassion&quot;.

In August 2013, it was disclosed that Remini had filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) concerning Shelly Miscavige, the wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, who has not been seen in public since 2007. After the report was filed, the LAPD looked into the matter, met and spoke with Shelly Miscavige before closing the investigation, and stated Remini&#x27;s report was &quot;unfounded&quot;. Scientology said in a statement that the whole affair was simply harassment and a publicity stunt for Remini.

In October 2013, it was reported that Remini had been subpoenaed to testify in a lawsuit in Comal County, Texas, against Scientology and David Miscavige, regarding acts of alleged harassment and surveillance against Monique Rathbun, who was married to ex-Scientology executive Mark Rathbun. Monique Rathbun&#x27;s attorney, Ray Jeffery, said he wanted Remini to give a deposition in the hopes she could testify that Miscavige has vast influence over the operations of the Church and had to have known about the alleged harassment. In 2023, Remini sued the Church of Scientology and David Miscavige, accusing them of harassment, stalking, psychological torture, and operating an over ten-year campaign to ruin and destroy Remini&#x27;s life and livelihood.

=== Catholicism ===
In a 2015 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Remini talked about her embrace of Catholicism, the comfort she was finding in the religion&#x27;s practices, and how this contrasted with her experience of Scientology.

=== Family ===
Remini met actor Angelo Pagán at a Cuban restaurant in 1996. Pagán has three sons from previous relationships. He and Remini were married in Las Vegas by a Scientologist minister on July 19, 2003. Their daughter Sofia was born on June 16, 2004. In September 2015, when Sofia was eleven years old, her parents celebrated her baptism into the Catholic Church. On August 29, 2024, Remini announced via Instagram that she and Pagán have decided to divorce. They finalized their divorce in October of 2024.

=== Education ===

Remini had left school with just an 8th-grade education, which she attributes to her involvement with Scientology. In May 2021, Remini was accepted into an associate degree program in liberal arts at New York University, saying:

In 2023, after completing her second year at NYU, Remini expressed how &quot;undertaking this educational journey has been one of the most difficult experiences of my life.&quot; She completed her associate degree in March 2024 and began working toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

<doc id="991727" wikidata="Q1266313" url="?curid=991727" title="Mindoro bleeding-heart">
<text>The Mindoro bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba platenae), also referred to as &quot;kulo-kulo&quot;, &quot;la-do&quot;, &quot;manatad&quot;, &quot;manuk-manuk&quot;, &quot;punay&quot;, and &quot;puñalada&quot; by the Mangyan, is a species of ground dove native solely to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. It is critically endangered and threatened by habitat loss largely motivated by marble extraction. Due to its biological line and its survival status, it has been listed as an EDGE species by the Zoological Society of London.

Because it is one of the rarest birds in the world and has an elusive nature, often hiding in the underbrush of forests, there is little known about its remaining populations.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
This species is closely related to four other bleeding-heart dove species: &quot;G. luzonica&quot;, &quot;G. crinigera&quot;, &quot;G. keayi&quot; and &quot;G. menagei&quot;. These five species, along with &quot;G. rufigula,&quot; are grouped together into the genus &quot;Gallicolumba.&quot; A phylogenetic study in 2013 found strong evidence suggesting that the Philippine bleeding-hearts are monophyletic, or that they belong to the same taxonomic clade tied by a common ancestor.

The Mindoro bleeding-heart is monotypic, meaning it does not contain any smaller subspecies groups.

Its taxonomic standing, which dates back to Salvadori in 1893, is deemed valid by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System.

== Description ==
This ground pigeon has been recorded to be around tall. It has a dark grey forehead which transitions into an iridescent green on its head, nape, and hindneck. Its underside–from its throat to its flanks–is a cream-white except for the distinctive patch on the center of its breast which resembles a bright bleeding wound. The chest marking is less prominent and more orange in hue than that of related bleeding-heart doves. The dove&#x27;s backside contains a reddish purple on its mantle, as well as chestnut coloration on its wings and rump. Its tail and uppertail-coverts are grey. Flecks of white triangles rest on its shoulders.

Its juvenile plumage is unknown.

Like other pigeons, Mindoro bleeding-hearts do not exhibit much sexual dimorphism. Females look similar to males but have purple irises and are generally smaller, with a wingspan (compared to in males).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Mindoro bleeding-heart dove is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. It typically dwells in lowlands at an altitude of , but has been noted at . It has only been observed in 4 regions of the island since 1980, as deforestation has dwindled its preferred habitat of closed-canopy primary forest. These regions are Puerto Galera, MUFRC Experimental Forest, Siburan, and Mounts Iglit–Baco Natural Park, but scientists believe other populations may be scattered in other localities. This bird favors dry forest floors overrun with bamboos and rattans, occasionally dotted with limestone outcrops and boulders. It has also been observed near pools of dry riverbeds that exist on more leveled forest floors without as many rocks.

This dove is thought to be sedentary instead of migratory, but it is uncertain if it engages in altitudinal, seasonal or nomadic movements. It runs from danger and only flees from predators via brief flight when absolutely necessary.

== Behavior and ecology ==

=== Vocalizations ===
Few recordings of the Mindoro bleeding-heart&#x27;s song exist, and some of those that do are not made publicly available because they threaten to exacerbate issues of trapping and endangerment. However, its call is believed to resemble a &quot;croo croo&quot; not unlike that of the Negros bleeding-heart.

=== Breeding ===
It has been recorded breeding from February to May. Nests containing two cream-colored eggs have been found in late April and late June; the nests are made of sticks, leaves, and thin rootlets resting on horizontal branches of shrubs or trees off the ground. According to one account, a female was seen feigning injury so as to distract from the nest she was incubating.

=== Food and feeding ===
The dietary habits of the Mindoro bleeding-heart are not well-documented, but they are assumed to be similar to those of &quot;G. luzonica&quot;. It has been sighted feeding on fruiting figs alongside the genus &quot;Treron,&quot; or green pigeons.

=== Threats and Survival ===
The IUCN Red List classifies it as Critically Endangered with an estimate of just 50–249 mature individuals and a declining population. The species&#x27; estimated extent of occurrence is . There are no individuals in captivity.

Its main threats are habitat loss and trapping. Extreme loss of forest has been caused by illegal logging, dynamite-blasting for marble, and slash-and-burn (also known as kaingin). In 1988, just of forest remained on Mindoro, only 25% of which was closed-canopy. Snares intended mainly for other animals such as Red junglefowl and other small mammals accidentally catch bleeding-hearts.

== Conservation status ==
A conservation study in 1991 found that the island of Mindoro is particularly susceptible to endemism, as it has the least forest cover of any Philippine island after the Sulu Islands. There are six bird species endemic to the island which can be categorized as montane and lowland; the Mindoro bleeding-heart is a lowland species which has been hunted with snares to meet demands for meat and pet trade.

Conservation actions proposed include to map the remaining forests on Mindoro, and survey these areas to clarify its current distribution and population status. It has also been recommended follow up on anecdotal reports of the species, establish captive breeding populations, conduct ecological studies to assess its requirements for breeding and foraging, and regulate hunting of wildlife species and the extraction of forest products within key habitats.

Various NGOs have been working to protect the Mindoro bleeding-heart and the other species in its genus. The Haribon Foundation has invested over 15 years in a project that seeks to integrate local communities via education and development; the organization has simultaneously teamed up with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and local government initiatives to push for legislation that forbids deforestation. One method being used is &quot;rainforestation&quot;, or the planting of native tree species which are easy to germinate, in contrast with typical reforestation efforts that introduce exotic species.

<text>The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; also gyrus frontalis inferior) is the lowest positioned gyrus of the frontal gyri, of the frontal lobe, and is part of the prefrontal cortex.

Its superior border is the inferior frontal sulcus (which divides it from the middle frontal gyrus), its inferior border is the lateral sulcus (which divides it from the superior temporal gyrus) and its posterior border is the inferior precentral sulcus. Above it is the middle frontal gyrus, behind it is the precentral gyrus.

The inferior frontal gyrus contains Broca&#x27;s area, which is involved in language processing and speech production.

==Structure==
The inferior frontal gyrus is highly convoluted and has three cytoarchitecturally diverse regions. The three subdivisions are an opercular part, a triangular part, and an orbital part. These divisions are marked by two rami arising from the lateral sulcus. The ascending ramus separates the opercular and triangular parts. The anterior (horizontal) ramus separates the triangular and orbital parts.

* Opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), (cortex posterior to the ascending ramus of the lateral sulcus), is the part of frontal lobe that overlies the insular cortex and may be associated with recognizing a tone of voice in spoken native languages. This expands on previous work indicating that comprehension of inflectional morpheme processing is associated with the inferior frontal gyrus.
* Triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), (cortex between the ascending ramus and the horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus). It may be associated with the ability to translate from a secondary or tertiary language back to one&#x27;s native language. 
* Orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) (cortex inferior and anterior to the horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus)

Cytoarchitecturally the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 44 (BA44). The triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 45 (BA45), and the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as
Brodmann area 47. The opercular part and the triangular part (BA44 and BA45) make up Broca&#x27;s area.

== Function ==
The inferior frontal gyrus has a number of functions including the processing of speech and language in Broca&#x27;s area. Neural circuitry has been shown to connect different sites of stimulus to other regions of response including other subdivisions and also other frontal gyri.

===Language processing===
The left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is a part of the articulatory network involved in motor syllable programs. The articulatory network also contains the premotor cortex, and the anterior insula. These areas are interrelated but have specific functions in speech comprehension and production. The articulatory network acts mostly when the vocal tract moves to produce syllables. The pars opercularis acts indirectly through the motor cortex to control the motor aspect of speech production, and codes motor programs for this system, while the auditory cortex (via the temporoparietal junction in the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure) houses a series of sensory targets. Together, these areas function as a sensory-motor loop for syllable information coding.

In a study conducted comparing phonological and arithmetic processing and the involvement of different sections of the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus, cortical activation for phonology, subtraction, and multiplication tasks was compared. The predetermined language-calculation network was limited to the left inferior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus. The results were significant to support that there was a pattern of left lateralization for each of these tasks all activating the Perisylvian fissure network, with some general localized areas for phonology and arithmetic. It was supported that phonology activated the pars opercularis (BA44), and anterior angular gyrus, multiplication mainly implicated the pars triangularis (BA45), and the posterior angular gyrus. These systems are activated through similar neuronal processes but independently placed along the network.

===Language comprehension and production===
Most language processing takes place in Broca&#x27;s area usually in the left hemisphere. Damage to this region often results in a type of non-fluent aphasia known as Broca&#x27;s aphasia. Broca&#x27;s area is made up of the pars opercularis and the pars triangularis, both of which contribute to verbal fluency, but each has its own specific contribution. The pars opercularis (BA44) is involved in language production and phonological processing due to its connections with motor areas of the mouth and tongue. The pars triangularis (BA45) is involved in semantic processing. Characteristics of Broca&#x27;s aphasia include agrammatic speech, relatively good language comprehension, poor repetition, and difficulty speaking mostly uttering short sentences made up mostly of nouns. The left IFG has also been suggested to play a role in inhibitory processes, including the tendency to inhibit learning from undesirable information. For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left IFG has been shown to release such inhibition, increasing the ability to learn from undesirable information.

The right opercular part of the IFG, (BA44) has been implicated in go/no go tasks. In these tasks, the participant encounters a preliminary task (for instance repeatedly pressing a button), and then must halt this task whenever a &quot;no go&quot; signal is presented, ultimately measuring a level of impulse control through inhibition of a prepotent response. It seems that the same area is also implicated in risk aversion: a study found that higher risk aversion correlated with higher activity at IFG. This might be explained as an inhibition signal to accept a risky option. Disruption of activity of this area with transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) leads to change in risk attitudes, as behaviorally demonstrated by choices over risky outcomes.

<text>The Emergency Response Team (ERT; ) are police tactical units of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police based throughout Canada and are mainly part-time teams. According to the RCMP, the ERT &quot;is a group of highly-trained RCMP members capable of employing specialized weapons, equipment, and tactics to resolve extremely high-risk situations.&quot; The ERT is also mandated to assess the situation and determine whether extreme danger or the presence of small arms cannot be easily resolved by RCMP officers on general duties or by other police forces throughout Canada. The ERT offers consulting services to its fellow officers such as firearms files and shootings that involve police officers.

ERTs operate as a floating work-site team, which allows them to be called up for duty from their residences and not in an RCMP office. They also operate under a threat-based priority system if multiple emergency calls require ERT presence. ERT teams are legally bound to operate in Canada and overseas when required.

==History==
The RCMP established the ERT in 1977 in 31 centres throughout Canada. The creation of the ERT was modelled after the RCMP&#x27;s Hostage Assault and Rescue Program. Because of the problem in geography, which prevents the RCMP from pooling their resources to respond to a Canada-wide incident, the Canadian government initially mandated the creation of the Special Emergency Response Team or SERT on January 22, 1986. 51 officers were trained for SERT duties as the unit would operate in circumstances where local police forces do not have enough resources to resolve the incident. The SERT was eventually disbanded in 1993 as they were not suited for quasi-military operations with problems on whether lethal force is necessary or not, given its RCMP status.

The Marine Security Emergency Response Teams were created as a part of the ERT in 2006 with initial training in the waters of British Columbia as a key component of the Critical Incident Program to ensure ERT operators are fully prepared to respond to calls when a situation develops in the marine environment. MSERT teams were involved in protecting participants and the public during the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, BC.

The ERT received armoured vehicles from the RCMP as a means of bolstering their effectiveness in the field. Surplus AVGP Cougars were handed to the ERTs in 2010 as a means of transporting ERT operators in situations where firearms were known to be involved. These vehicles are used without any turrets or other offensive weapons as they were removed prior to ERT adoption since they are used for transportation purposes only. They were first used by RCMP ERT teams to bust a drug grow op in Chilliwack, BC.

In 2012, the RCMP and Navistar Defense Canada Inc. worked together to create their own armoured vehicles for the ERTs when RCMP Assistant Commissioner Russ Mirasty, commanding officer of the RCMP’s for F division in Saskatchewan, unveiled them to the public. Known as the Tactical Armored Vehicle, these were made at the cost of US$14,019,826 with a working lifespan of 15 years. 18 TAVs were delivered to various ERTs throughout Canada as their main support vehicle when on call.

==Qualifications==
Prospective male and female ERT operator candidates are required to have two years of operational experience in the RCMP, as well as to score a total of 225 or more at their PPC qualifications. ERT operator candidates are also required to attend to psychological evaluations to weed out candidates who have problems working in environments that involve confined spaces, height or water. Candidates are allowed into ERT operational service once he or she completes a nine-week ERT course in Ottawa, which consists of theoretical, firearms and tactical training.

ERT operators are required to do training when not on duty, which consist of daily training for full-time ERT operators and a minimum of two days for part-time ERT operators.

==Training==
Before the timed obstacle was implemented on April 1, 2009, ERT operator candidates are required to pass a physical training exam that consists of a 1.5 mile run in under 11 minutes, 40 consecutive and uninterrupted pushups, 40 sit-ups in one minute, 5 wide-grip pull-ups and bench press with a weight of 135 pounds.

ERT training consists of three blocks. They consist of the following:

* Block 1: Firearms / Rappelling
* Block 2: Rural patrol tactics
* Block 3: Interior combat / CQB

Additional training courses, such as the Sniper / Observer course, the Aircraft assault course and the basic and advanced Marine Operations courses, are open to ERT operators once they are officially admitted. These advanced courses are overseen by the National Tactical Training Section.
==Weapons==

, ERT operators had access to the following firearms, which were standardized by the National Policy Centre for all ERT teams for operational purposes:

* SIG Sauer P226, being used as the main sidearm to replace the Smith &amp; Wesson 5946.
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5A3 SMG
* Remington Model 700P Sniper rifle
* Remington Model 870 Shotgun
* Colt Canada C8 Carbine 
==Duties==
In 2001, the duties of the ERT were described as the following:

* Resolving incidents involving armed &amp; barricaded persons
* Aircraft interventions
* Marine interventions (armed ship boarding)
* High-risk searches &amp; arrests
* High-risk prisoner transport
* VIP &amp; witness protection duties
* Covert surveillance and intelligence gathering
* Rural tracking operations

==Operations==
From August 1995 to September 1995 RCMP ERT was involved in the Gustafsen Lake Standoff.

In September, 2007 the RCMP ERT rescued a three-year-old child from a man who had fired numerous shots in a house in Chilliwack, British Columbia.

In June 2010, RCMP ERT officers assisted with the G20 Summit in Toronto, ON.

In March, 2011 the RCMP ERT responded to a residence in Surrey, BC where a 13-year-old girl had been shot in the back and the house set on fire. The girl ran from the house to a nearby school. Believing the shooter and additional young victims were in the residence, ERT officers forced their way into the house while it was still on fire. The shooter was located inside with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. ERT officers provided CPR at scene until BCAS paramedics arrived, however the shooter later died.
==Controversies==
The ERT was found to be justified in shooting Delbert Kenneth Pelletier at the Muskowekwan First Nation in Melville, Saskatchewan. ERT was deployed to the area on November 13, 2006 due to reports of Pelletier being armed with a gun while acting irrational and suicidal. Pelletier&#x27;s wife fled the residence prior to police arrival. Pelletier was shot by police snipers shortly after Pelletier shot at a police vehicle, striking the door but not injuring any of the officers inside. Among the recommendations made after the inquiry include cultural relations training, including the presence of an elder&#x27;s program at the RCMP Depot before ERTs would be officially deployed. Bob Hrycan, a lawyer for Calvin and Fisher Pelletier, accuses the RCMP of conducting excessive force. The Pelletier family has made calls for a wider probe into the shooting death of Delbert Pelletier.

In 2009, ERT tactical gear was reported to be stolen in Kamloops, BC. No weapons or firearms were taken. Some of items that were permanently missing are now believed to have been sold/bought in the underground black market.

ERT operators were involved in the shooting death of ex-Canadian soldier Gregory Matters in 2012, who was reported to be using a hatchet before he was shot in Prince George, BC. An investigation was conducted by the BC Independent Investigations Office. The Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP has launched an official inquiry into the death as well. The RCMP was found to be justified in the shooting after the investigations.

<text>R. Orin Cornett (November 13, 1913 – December 7, 2002) was an American physicist, university professor and administrator, and the inventor of a literacy system for the deaf, known as Cued Speech.

==Biography==
R. &quot;(Richard)&quot; Orin Cornett was born in Driftwood, Oklahoma, a now unincorporated town near the Kansas border located in Alfalfa County, on November 14, 1913. He earned his BS degree in mathematics from Oklahoma Baptist University in 1934, followed by an MS from the University of Oklahoma in 1937. In 1940, Cornett was awarded a Ph.D. in physics and applied mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, with his thesis entitled, “Acoustic Spectra of Edge Tones.” From 1935 to 1945, Dr. Cornett taught physics, mathematics, and electronics at Oklahoma Baptist, Penn State, and Harvard Universities.

In 1959, Cornett became the director of the Division of Higher Education at the U.S. Office of Education. While in that position, upon the review of funding for Gallaudet College (present-day Gallaudet University), he was appalled to discover that most deaf persons had below grade level reading skills and fail to achieve literacy at a native-level. In 1965, Cornett accepted a position as the Vice President for Long-Range Planning at Gallaudet. While serving there, he devised a phonemic system which rendered the English language visually, rather than acoustically, to address the issue of deaf literacy. He called this novel system Cued Speech. In 1971 his job title was changed to: &quot;Vice President for Long Range Planning and Public Services&quot; and during the 1970-1971 academic year he was the acting director of the Model Secondary School for the Deaf on the Gallaudet College campus. He was made a member of the faculty in 1966.

The invention of Cued Speech in 1966 opened a new field within deaf education. His Cued Speech system was based on the hypothesis that if all the sounds in the spoken language could clearly be made to look different from each other coming from the lips of the speaker, those who were hearing impaired would learn a language in much the same way as a hearing person, but through the use of their vision rather than acoustically. Of the system, Cornett stated, &quot;A few months of study convinced me that the underlying cause of their &quot;(deaf persons)&quot; reading problem was the lack of any reasonable way to learn spoken language, without which they could not use speech for communication, become good lipreaders, or learn to read (as opposed to being taught the recognition of each written word). So, I really started with the conclusion that what was needed was a convenient way to represent the spoken language accurately, through vision, in real time. That was the problem I set out to solve, the perceived need that set my direction.”

From 1975 to 1984, he became research professor and director of Cued Speech Programs. From 1981 to 1983, he also served as Gallaudet&#x27;s Chairman of the Center for Studies in Language and Communication. During Cornett&#x27;s tenure there, he adapted his Cued Speech system to 52 languages and major dialects, while writing and publishing audiocassette lessons in 34 of those languages and dialects. Upon his retirement in 1984, Gallaudet University awarded him the status of professor emeritus. He continued working with the international Cued Speech community from his Maryland home after his retirement.

During his career, Cornett wrote and published hundreds of articles as well as several books on mathematics, physics, higher education, deaf education, Cued Speech and other subjects. He also served as editor of several publications, including the parental guidebook &quot;Cued Speech Resource Book for Parents of Deaf Children&quot; ().

Cornett died on December 17, 2002, in Laurel, Maryland, at the age of 89. His wife of 59 years, Lorene, had died on January 21 of the same year.

<text>InQuest Gamer was a monthly magazine for game reviews and news that was published from 1995 to 2007. The magazine was published by Wizard Entertainment (not to be confused with Wizards of the Coast, which produced its own CCG magazine, &quot;The Duelist&quot;).

Originally, the magazine was named InQuest and focused solely on collectible card games (CCGs); &quot;InQuest&quot;, along with its competitor &quot;Scrye&quot;, were the two major CCG magazines. Later, the magazine changed its focus to cover a wider range of games, including role-playing games, computer and video games, collectible miniature games, board games, and others. 

==History==
&quot;InQuest&quot; #0, the first issue, was published in April 1995. Because it was first published about two years after the release of &quot;&quot;, the trading card game was one of &quot;InQuest&#x27;s&quot; main topics. &quot;InQuest&quot; was frequently home to fictional cards, including &quot;purple&quot; cards featured in issue #22 (February 1997). These hypothetical cards, which used a new &quot;Portal&quot; land to create purple mana, led some to think that the then-upcoming Portal set would introduce a sixth color.

For issue #46 (February 1999), &quot;InQuest&quot; changed its name to &quot;InQuest Gamer&quot; (with &quot;Gamer&quot; in large text on the cover), clearly announcing that it was a magazine about games. Issue #53 made the &quot;InQuest&quot; title more prominent on the cover again and it was not changed after that, although the cover&#x27;s format was revamped with issue #122.

Typical content included news, strategy articles, a price guide for collectible card and miniature games, reference lists, and game-related entertainment and humor. Issues with special cards were mailed in plastic bags, issues without special cards were typically sold at retail stores and game shows without any special covering.

==Editors==
The magazine&#x27;s editorial staff included Mike Searle, Tom Slizewski, Jeff Hannes, Brent Fishbaugh, Steve Frohnhoefer, Paul Sudlow, Jeremy Smith, Thorin McGee, Kyle Ackerman, Alex Shvartsman and Rick Swan. Martin A. Stever was responsible for the magazine&#x27;s sales and marketing.

The magazine ceased publication in September 2007.

<text>Benjamin Contee (1755 – November 30, 1815) was an American Episcopal priest and statesman from Maryland. He was an officer in the American Revolutionary War, a delegate to the Confederation Congress, and member of the first United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Contee was the son of Col. Thomas Contee (1729–1811) and Sarah Fendall (1732–1793). He was born at &quot;Brookefield&quot;, near Nottingham, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, the home of his father, and original home of his ancestor, Maj. Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq. (1632–1676).

==Military and political career==
At beginning of the Revolutionary War, Contee entered the Continental Army, rising to the rank of captain of the 3rd Maryland Regiment, which proved to be one of the army&#x27;s elite units until its near annihilation at the Battle of Camden.

After the war he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, where he served from 1785 to 1787. He served as a delegate to the Confederation Congress from 1787 to 1788, and the third district of Maryland in the U.S. Congress from 1789 to 1791. Along with his brother Alexander Contee (1752–1810), he became a merchant of London, at their stores in Nottingham, Queen Anne and Upper Marlboro. He was declared insolvent due to &quot;mishaps in trade&quot;. After having served in Congress, he went to Europe and traveled through Spain, France, and England.

==Marriage and children==
On April 8, 1788, he married his cousin, Sarah Russell Lee (1766–1810). Sarah was born at &quot;Blenheim&quot; in 1766, and died December 6, 1810, at &quot;Bromont&quot;, near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland. Sarah was the daughter of Philip Thomas Lee (1736–1778) and Ann Russell (died 1777) of England. The Contees&#x27; children were Sarah &quot;Sallie&quot; Elinor Contee (1789 – ), Philip Ashton Lee Contee, Sr. (1795–1842), Edmund Henry Contee (1799–1832), and Alice Lee Contee (1803–1868), who married Gov. Joseph Kent.

==Episcopal minister==
On his return to America he completed his study in theology and was admitted to holy orders in 1803 by Rev. Thomas John Claggett, Bishop of Maryland, a neighbor, friend, helper and patriot of the Revolution. That same year he became rector of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s, Charles County. He was a distinguished minister of the Episcopal Church and for several years the incumbent of Port Tobacco Parish, Charles County, Maryland. He was a native of Prince George&#x27;s County and brought up in the church. In 1808, he added Trinity, and in 1811, St. Paul&#x27;s, Prince George&#x27;s Co., Maryland, to his charge. He continued as a Judge of the Orphan&#x27;s Court, and was always in the Standing Committee.

==Property==
Benjamin resided briefly in the mid-1790s at &quot;Blenheim&quot;. At the time of his death he was living at the glebe house of Trinity Parish near Allen&#x27;s Fresh. Benjamin and his wife were more than likely interred in the Contee cemetery at &quot;Locust Hill&quot; just outside Port Tobacco, which has been destroyed. If not there, then they were buried in the original Christ Church cemetery in Port Tobacco, which is now covered by swamp.

<text>USNS &quot;Sacagawea&quot; (T-AKE-2), a &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;-class dry cargo ship, is the third ship operated by the United States Navy to be named for Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who acted as guide and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and one of the few United States Navy ships named for women.

The contract to build her was awarded to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) of San Diego, California, on 18 October 2001. Construction began in September 2004 for a scheduled delivery in early 2007.

She was launched in June 2006. Two of Sacagawea&#x27;s descendants, Lucy Diaz and Rachel Ariwite, were the ship&#x27;s sponsors. USNS &quot;Sacagawea&quot; is one of 14 &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;-class ships and is part of the 14 ships that comprise the United States Marine Corps Maritime Prepositioning Program.

In January 2013, USNS &quot;Sacagawea&quot; was transferred to the Maritime Prepositioning Squadron Three (MPSRON-3) in Saipan. Within days of her arrival, she participated in Exercise Freedom Banner in the Republic of the Philippines. Freedom Banner is the only annually funded Maritime Prepositioning Force exercise in the Marine Corps and continues to be a proving ground for concept validation.

During Freedom Banner 13, the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) used both vertical connectors in the form of MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and surface connectors in the form of landing craft, utility (LCU), and landing craft, mechanized, “Mike 8” (LCM-8) boats loaded aboard USNS &quot;1st Lt. Jack Lummus&quot;. These dedicated ship-to-shore connectors not only enabled the standup of the MAGTF, but also provided sustainment to exercise forces ashore during the conduct of the exercise.

This vessel is the only USNS &quot;Sacagawea&quot;. However, other U.S. Navy vessels have been named .

<doc id="991754" wikidata="Q8028733" url="?curid=991754" title="Wizard Entertainment">
<text>Wizard Entertainment Inc., formerly known as Wizard World, was a producer of multi-genre fan conventions across North America.

The company that became Wizard Entertainment began in 1991 as Wizard Press, the publisher of the monthly magazine &quot;Wizard&quot;. That company evolved into a multi-title publishing company with diversified interests in branded products and related convention operations. By 2011, the company had discontinued its print division to focus exclusively on its convention business. By 2015, the company had expanded to producing 25 annual conventions around the U.S. In 2021, Wizard sold its convention events business to FanExpo.

==Corporate history==
Gareb Shamus founded &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine in January 1991 shortly after he graduated from college. The company was originally based in Congers, New York.

&quot;Wizard&quot; magazine was successful, and the company expanded its publishing operations with more magazines devoted to other elements of the collectible industry. Wizard purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1997 to expand from its core publishing business into trade/consumer conventions.

In early 2011, the company made some major corporate transitions. First, through an arrangement with Strato Malamas of the holding company GoEnergy, it became a publicly traded company known as Wizard World. At the same time, it abruptly canceled &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine and its other remaining publication, &quot;ToyFare&quot;, to focus on its convention business. 

Shamus was pushed out as company CEO in late 2011; his position was taken in March 2012 by John Macaluso. In 2015, the company lost $4.25 million in revenue and cut back from 25 to 19 convention events in 2016. Less than a week after the announcement of the losses, Macaluso resigned as CEO and was replaced by John D. Maatta.

In 2018, Wizard World was renamed Wizard Entertainment, Inc.

In 2021, after selling its last few conventions to FanExpo, Wizard Entertainment essentially ceased to exist.

== Publishing ==
&quot;Wizard&quot; started as a price guide to comics but evolved into focusing squarely on pop culture, specifically targeting young adult males. (The magazine ultimately featured a price guide to comics and action figures in the back of the magazine.) With its high-end production values and embodiment of the comic speculator boom, &quot;Wizard&quot; was an instant hit, with a monthly circulation of more than 100,000 copies (although by early 2006, circulation was down to around 50,000).

The magazine also spawned several ongoing magazines dedicated to similar interests, such as &quot;InQuest Gamer&quot; (launched 1995), for collectible game cards; &quot;ToyFare: The Toy Magazine&quot;, for toys and action figures (launched 1997); &quot;Anime Insider&quot; (launched 2001) for anime and manga; and &quot;Toy Wishes&quot; (launched 2001) for mainstream toy enthusiasts.

On January 24, 2011, after 20 years of publication, the company announced that &quot;Wizard&quot; would cease print publication and become an all-digital magazine called &quot;Wizard World&quot;, launching in February 2011. At that point Wizard Entertainment also ceased publication of its sister magazine, &quot;ToyFare&quot;.

===Black Bull Entertainment ===
In 2000, Wizard founder Shamus forayed into the world of actual comic book publishing, creating the imprint Black Bull Entertainment, featuring several well-known creators, including Mark Waid, Chris Eliopoulos, Nelson DeCastro, and Garth Ennis. The first Black Bull title was the limited series &quot;Gatecrasher: Ring of Fire&quot;. Black Bull&#x27;s titles included:

* &quot;Beautiful Killer&quot; (2002–2003), #1–3
* &quot;Gatecrasher&quot; (2000–2001), #1–6
* &quot;Gatecrasher: Ring of Fire&quot; (2000), #1–4
* &quot;Just a Pilgrim&quot; (2001), #1–5
* &quot;Just a Pilgrim: Garden of Eden&quot; (2002), #1–4
* &quot;The New West&quot; (2005), #1–2
* &quot;Shadow Reavers&quot; (2001–2002), #1–5

Black Bull published comics through 2005.

== Conventions ==
=== Beginnings and growth ===
Wizard purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1996; the renamed &quot;Wizard World Chicago&quot; was the template for a new kind of convention that shifted its focus from actual comic books to ancillary elements of pop culture fandom: celebrity performers, films, television, video games, and toys – &quot;comic conventions&quot; almost in name only. By 2006, Wizard World Chicago boasted a weekend attendance of over 58,000 people. 

In May 2002, Wizard branched out from Chicago and produced Wizard World East at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. And in 2003 the company produced Wizard World Texas, adding Wizard World Los Angeles in 2004 and Wizard World Boston in 2005.

In 2007–2008, Wizard held conventions in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Texas. In 2008, Wizard began adding an academic forum called &quot;Wizard World University,&quot; integrating scholarly panels into its conventions, beginning with the November convention in Arlington, Texas.

=== &quot;Con Wars&quot; / growing pains ===

Beginning in 2005, Wizard CEO Gareb Shamus made a concerted push to dominate the North American convention circuit. First, Wizard announced that it would be holding a comic book convention in Atlanta from June 30 – July 2, 2006, the same dates on which the long-running Charlotte, North Carolina–based Heroes Convention was scheduled to take place. This caused an outcry amongst the comic book community, as Atlanta is only a four-hour drive from Charlotte, and several comic book creators voiced concerns about an attempt by a large, corporate event to force out an independent comic book convention. As a result of the outcry, many prominent creators signed up to appear at HeroesCon 2006 rather than the competing Wizard con. Wizard ultimately announced that it would postpone the planned Atlanta convention until 2007.

In 2009, Wizard canceled its Texas event and postponed the Los Angeles convention. That spring and summer, however, Shamus/Wizard acquired the Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon and the Big Apple Comic Con, New York City&#x27;s longest-running comic book, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and pop culture convention.

Wizard Entertainment&#x27;s 2010 planned North American Comic Con tour included city stops in Toronto, Anaheim, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York City, Boston, New Jersey, and Austin. As part of a &quot;major offensive against Reed Exhibitions&#x27; New York Comic Con,&quot; Wizard scheduled &quot;three East Coast shows in a row—the New England Comic-Con in Boston on October 1-3, Big Apple the same weekend, and the new New Jersey Comic-Con the weekend after, on October 15-17.&quot; The 2010 Big Apple Comic Con was scheduled for October 7–10, the same dates as the previously scheduled New York Comic Con. After a public outcry, Wizard ended up moving the dates of its 2010 New York convention to October 1–3. (Additionally, the planned Wizard 2010 New Jersey convention was canceled.)

Despite Wizard World&#x27;s setbacks in Atlanta/Charlotte and New York City, by late 2010, it was apparent that the company&#x27;s strategy was to blanket the U.S. with Wizard conventions, including buying previously existing small-scale shows in various locations. 

=== Going public; further expansion ===
Wizard went public in 2011; its financial statements proved that it was doubling down on dominating the North American convention market:
Wizard&#x27;s 2011 convention calendar included &quot;a show-a-month schedule&quot; and guest-lists of &quot;nerd-lebrities of various levels of fame... turning their shows into autograph-focused events.&quot; Ultimately, however, Wizard scaled back its 2011 operations to seven shows—New Orleans, Toronto, Big Apple (New York), Philadelphia, Mid-Ohio, and Austin—ultimately canceling scheduled conventions in Los Angeles, Miami, Atlanta, and Central Canada. In addition, previously announced new Wizard conventions in New Jersey, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Nashville never materialized.

Wizard skipped New York altogether in 2012, returning in 2013 with a &quot;Wizard World New York Experience&quot; focused on &quot;celebrities, creators, sports stars, music, exhibitors, parties and other attractions&quot;—very little comics content. The rest of Wizard&#x27;s 2013 convention schedule included Portland, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Wizard World Chicago, Ohio Comic Con, Nashville, Austin, and New Orleans. In September 2013, Wizard World announced seven new stops for the 2014 tour: Sacramento, Louisville, Minneapolis, Atlanta, San Antonio, Richmond, and Tulsa. Wizard gave up the New York market after 2013 due to the dominance of the New York Comic Con; in 2014 the Big Apple con was reacquired by its founder, Michael Carbonaro.

The explosion in Wizard-produced conventions brought accusations that the entertainment behemoth was deliberately trying to push its competitors out of business. On the other hand, many praised Wizard&#x27;s professional and standardized approach to producing conventions.

=== Convention contraction === 
In 2015, Wizard produced 25 conventions but lost $4.25 million in revenue. The 2016 schedule, cut back to 19 events, included Wizard cons in Portland, Cleveland, Las Vegas, St. Louis, Madison, Minneapolis, Des Moines, Philadelphia, Sacramento, Albuquerque, Columbus, Orlando, Chicago, Richmond, Austin, Tulsa, and Pittsburgh.

By 2018, the company was producing thirteen annual conventions around the U.S.

=== Post-pandemic woes; sale of convention business ===
The COVID-19 pandemic hit Wizard Entertainment hard—as it did the convention business worldwide. Most 2020 conventions scheduled for after mid-March of that year were canceled, and many moved online in 2021.

Wizard World held only six in-person conventions in 2021, and that August the company announced it would be selling the convention events business to FanExpo, with the final Wizard World Chicago show occurring in October.

<doc id="991758" wikidata="Q423646" url="?curid=991758" title="Transglutaminase">
<text>Transglutaminases are enzymes that in nature primarily catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between γ-carboxamide groups ( -(C=O)NH2 ) of glutamine residue side chains and the ε-amino groups ( -NH2 ) of lysine residue side chains with subsequent release of ammonia ( NH3 ). Lysine and glutamine residues must be bound to a peptide or a protein so that this cross-linking (between separate molecules) or intramolecular (within the same molecule) reaction can happen. Bonds formed by transglutaminase exhibit high resistance to proteolytic degradation (proteolysis). The reaction is
:Gln-(C=O)NH2 + NH2-Lys → Gln-(C=O)NH-Lys + NH3
Transglutaminases can also join a primary amine ( RNH2 ) to the side chain carboxyamide group of a protein/peptide bound glutamine residue thus forming an isopeptide bond
:Gln-(C=O)NH2 + RNH2 → Gln-(C=O)NHR + NH3

These enzymes can also deamidate glutamine residues to glutamic acid residues in the presence of water
:Gln-(C=O)NH2 + H2O → Gln-COOH + NH3
Transglutaminase isolated from &quot;Streptomyces mobaraensis&quot; -bacteria for example, is a calcium-independent enzyme. Mammalian transglutaminases among other transglutaminases require Ca2+ ions as a cofactor.

Transglutaminases were first described in 1959. The exact biochemical activity of transglutaminases was discovered in blood coagulation protein factor XIII in 1968.

==Examples==
Nine transglutaminases have been characterised in humans, eight of which catalyse transamidation reactions. These TGases have a three or four-domain organization, with immunoglobulin-like domains surrounding the central catalytic domain. The core domain belongs to the papain-like protease superfamily (CA clan) and uses a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad. Protein 4.2, also referred to as band 4.2, is a catalytically inactive member of the human transglutaminase family that has a Cys to Ala substitution at the catalytic triad.

Bacterial transglutaminases are single-domain proteins with a similarly-folded core. The transglutaminase found in some bacteria runs on a Cys-Asp diad.


==Biological role==
Transglutaminases form extensively cross-linked, generally insoluble protein polymers. These biological polymers are indispensable for an organism to create barriers and stable structures. Examples are blood clots (coagulation factor XIII), skin, and hair. The catalytic reaction is generally viewed as being irreversible, and must be closely monitored through extensive control mechanisms.

==Role in disease==
Deficiency of factor XIII (a rare genetic condition) predisposes to hemorrhage; concentrated enzyme can be used to correct the abnormality and reduce bleeding risk.

Anti-transglutaminase antibodies are found in celiac disease and may play a role in the small bowel damage in response to dietary gliadin that characterises this condition. In the related condition dermatitis herpetiformis, in which small bowel changes are often found and which responds to dietary exclusion of gliadin-containing wheat products, epidermal transglutaminase is the predominant autoantigen.

Recent research indicates that sufferers from neurological diseases like Huntington&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s may have unusually high levels of one type of transglutaminase, tissue transglutaminase. It is hypothesized that tissue transglutaminase may be involved in the formation of the protein aggregates that causes Huntington&#x27;s disease, although it is most likely not required.

Mutations in keratinocyte transglutaminase are implicated in lamellar ichthyosis.

==Structural studies==

As of late 2007, 19 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

==Industrial and culinary applications==
In commercial food processing, transglutaminase is used to bond proteins together. Examples of foods made using transglutaminase include imitation crabmeat, and fish balls. It is produced by &quot;Streptomyces mobaraensis&quot; fermentation in commercial quantities () or extracted from animal blood, and is used in a variety of processes, including the production of processed meat and fish products.

Transglutaminase can be used as a binding agent to improve the texture of protein-rich foods such as surimi or ham.

Thrombin–fibrinogen &quot;meat glue&quot; from bovine and porcine sources was banned throughout the European Union as a food additive in 2010. Transglutaminase remains allowed and is not required to be declared, as it is considered a processing aid and not an additive which remains present in the final product.

===Molecular gastronomy===
Transglutaminase is also used in molecular gastronomy to meld new textures with existing tastes. Besides these mainstream uses, transglutaminase has been used to create some unusual foods. British chef Heston Blumenthal is credited with the introduction of transglutaminase into modern cooking.

Wylie Dufresne, chef of New York&#x27;s avant-garde restaurant wd~50, was introduced to transglutaminase by Blumenthal, and invented a &quot;pasta&quot; made from over 95% shrimp thanks to transglutaminase.

It included a price guide, as well as comic book, movie, anime, and collector news, interviews, and previews.

&quot;Wizard&quot; launched in July 1991. With issue #7, the magazine switched to glossy paper and color printing. &quot;Wizard&quot; strongly supported new publishers Valiant Comics and Image Comics, heavily promoting their new releases.

With its high-end production values and embodiment of the comic speculator boom, &quot;Wizard&quot; was an instant hit, with a monthly circulation of more than 100,000 copies.

The magazine&#x27;s success led Wizard Entertainment to launch several ongoing magazines dedicated to similar interests — such as &quot;InQuest Gamer&quot; for collectible game cards (published 1995–2007), &quot;ToyFare&quot; for toys and action figures (1997–2011), &quot;Anime Insider&quot; for anime and manga (2001–2009), and &quot;Toy Wishes&quot; for mainstream toy enthusiasts ( 1999– 2008).

In 2006, &quot;Wizard&quot; was revamped with a bigger look and more pages, switching from the &quot;perfect bound&quot; staple-free look to that of a more traditional magazine. In November 2006, &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine editor-in-chief and co-founder Pat McCallum was fired, after more than a decade with the company. &quot;Wizard&quot; declined to say why he was removed. On February 21, 2007, Scott Gramling was announced as the new editor-in-chief.

After issue #200 (June 2008), &quot;Wizard&quot; made several changes to the magazine, shifting focus from reviews and humor to information about upcoming comics and the industry as a whole. The three-page &quot;Magic Words&quot; section, which consisted of reader questions, was dropped and replaced by &quot;Fan Mail&quot;, a half-page section allowing three short (and often humorous) letters. Soon after, in August 2008, longtime &quot;Wizard&quot; Editor Brian Cunningham was removed. The final editor was a former staff writer and managing editor Mike Cotton. On February 27, 2009, &quot;Wizard&quot; laid off 10% of its workforce, including its three staff writers, in order to make room for freelance writers.

&quot;Wizard&quot; was relaunched with issue #228 (August 2010), which featured Mark Millar as a guest editor. The magazine returned to its strictly comic book roots. The issue featured a &quot;Green Hornet&quot; film cover and a round table discussion with creators in the comic book film industry.

Despite all these changes, however, the magazine was losing subscribers at an unsustainable rate; by December 2010, its circulation was just 17,000 copies. On January 24, 2011, Rich Johnston of the website &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; confirmed that the magazine would cease print publication, that almost all of its magazine staff had been laid off, and all freelance engagements were canceled. This was confirmed later that day by &quot;Wizard&quot;, who also revealed that its sister magazine, &quot;ToyFare&quot;, was also canceled. According to the publication&#x27;s representatives, &quot;Wizard&quot; would be relaunched in February 2011 as an online magazine called &quot;Wizard World&quot;. The first issue of &quot;Wizard World&quot; was made available online and through major digital distribution channels on March 2, 2011.

==Regular features==
The magazine went through an ever-changing line-up of regular and semi-regular features, including:
* Book Shelf – Brief descriptions of the monthly trade paperback and hardcover collection releases.
* Top 10 Writers and Artists – Lists charting the most popular creators of the month in each category.

Retired features include
* Casting Call – A feature proposing the &quot;dream&quot; cast for potential film adaptations of various comic books. It later appeared sporadically.
* Last Man Standing – A dream &quot;face-off&quot; between two different characters or teams, always of different companies and/or universes. The feature would detail a brief showdown between the two, including the victor, and would be accompanied by an exclusive illustration (usually by a high-profile artist) depicting the battle.

==Exclusive offers==
Both &quot;Wizard&quot; and &quot;ToyFare&quot; often featured mail-away offers for exclusive merchandise. &quot;Wizard&quot; began a practice of producing specially offered &quot;Wizard&quot; #½ issues. These were special issues of ongoing major comic book series which featured in-continuity stories that supplemented the regular series&#x27; published issues. The issues were numbered #½ so as not to disrupt the series&#x27; ongoing numbering system. Often &quot;Wizard&quot; would also include free pack-in issues with their magazines, usually numbered as &quot;Wizard&quot; #0.

==Wizard Fan Awards==

The magazine presented the Wizard Fan Awards annually for works of distinction within the comics industry from 1993 to 2006. In 1993, the awards were presented at Dragon Con; in 1994, they were presented at Great Eastern Conventions&#x27; Philadelphia Comic Book Spectacular; in 1995, the awards moved their home to the Chicago Comicon (later renamed Wizard World Chicago), where they remained for the remainder of their existence.

<text>Havarti () or cream havarti () is a semisoft Danish cow&#x27;s milk cheese. It can be sliced, grilled, or melted.

== History ==
Havarti was previously called &quot;Danish Tilsiter&quot; after the German cheese type tilsiter. Danish production began in 1921. In 1952, the cheese was named Havarti, after Havartigården near Holte, where the Danish cheese pioneer Hanne Nielsen worked in the 19th century. Among other cheeses, Nielsen created a Tilsit cheese with caraway for King Christian IX of Denmark.

Some sources, such as &quot;The Oxford Companion to Cheese&quot;, say that Nielsen invented Havarti cheese, while the &quot;Dansk Biografisk Leksikon&quot; states that the current Havarti is not based on her cheesemaking.

The original havarti cheese is different from &quot;flødehavarti&quot; (&quot;cream Havarti&quot;), which is made from high-pasteurized milk, so that the whey proteins that would otherwise be eliminated during production remain in the curd. This raises yields, but alters the taste and texture. Cream havarti usually ripens very little, since the remaining whey proteins cause problems (off-taste, odd appearance) during prolonged ripening.

== Description ==
Havarti is made like most cheeses, by introducing rennet to milk to cause curdling. The curds are pressed into cheese molds which are drained, and then the cheese is aged.

Havarti was traditionally a &quot;smear-rind&quot; cheese, but modern &quot;flødehavarti&quot; is not. Havarti is a washed-curd cheese, which contributes to the subtle flavor of the cheese. Havarti is an interior-ripened cheese that is rindless, smooth, and slightly bright-surfaced with a cream to yellow color depending on type. It has very small and irregular openings called eyes distributed throughout.

Havarti has a buttery aroma and can be somewhat sharp in the stronger varieties, much like Swiss-type cheeses. The taste is buttery, from somewhat to very sweet, and slightly acidic, similar in taste to mozzarella. It is typically aged about three months, though when the cheese is older, it becomes more salty and tastes like hazelnut. When left at room temperature, the cheese tends to soften quickly.

Flavored variants of havarti are available.

==Production==
In 2013, 18,900 metric tons were produced in Denmark. As of 2019, 17,000 metric tons are produced annually in Denmark, of which 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons are consumed domestically. In 2015, 17,700 metric tons were produced in Wisconsin and 7,400 in Canada. In 2018, Wisconsin produced 18,400 metric tons and Canada 7,500 metric tons.

Less than half of the world production is made in Denmark. Other major producers in the EU are Germany and Spain. Internationally, the main producers are the United States and Canada, with other producing countries including Finland, Poland, France, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the main producing state by far is Wisconsin, with other producing states being California, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington. The Danish multinational Arla Foods produces the cheese for the American market in Wisconsin from milk produced in Wisconsin. 

Havarti is one of twelve cheeses whose characteristics and manufacturing standards are registered in the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; as of 2019.

==Consumption==
It has become a staple foodstuff in Denmark.

==Controversy==
In October 2019, the EU granted exclusive Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) rights to Denmark after four years of lobbying by the Danish industry. It may now only be produced from Danish milk and at approved dairies, for it to be sold in the EU and countries with which it has signed a trade agreement recognising EU PGI rules on cheese (specifically South Korea). There was vehement opposition and pressure from the US against recognition, which earlier compelled the EU to postpone the planned PGI status fearing it might be deemed too provocative amidst indications of a political backlash from the United States. 

The Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN), an industry alliance based in Virginia, United States, representing exporting interests founded by the U.S. Dairy Export Council to fight EU geographical indication guidelines expressed outrage over the 2019 EU decision to reserve the name for Denmark, claiming the PGI status is not &quot;legitimate intellectual property protection, but instead for barely concealed protectionism for economic gain&quot;. The United States, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina have joined with the CCFN to overturn the decision. The CCFN has claimed that havarti is a generic cheese, and that the EU is trying to &quot;egregiously ... monopolise global trade&quot; in this and many other traditional European products, and is disregarding &quot;established international standards&quot;. The CCFN demands that EU PGIs are amended to include the name of the region where it is produced, such that only the name &quot;Danish havarti&quot; is protected, a proposal Danish producers are amenable to. Danish producers contend it is domestically well known as a Danish cheese and knowledge of the cheese outside Denmark is &quot;extremely limited&quot;. The CCFN urged the Trump administration to sanction the EU for its &quot;abuses&quot;.

<doc id="991767" wikidata="Q1753625" url="?curid=991767" title="Anthology 2">
<text>Anthology 2 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 18 March 1996 by Apple Records as part of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; series. It features rarities, outtakes and live performances from the 1965 sessions for &quot;Help!&quot; until the sessions immediately prior to their trip to India in February 1968. It is the second in a trilogy of albums with &quot;Anthology 1&quot; and &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, all of which tie in with the televised special &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;. The opening track is &quot;Real Love&quot;, the second of the two recordings that reunited the Beatles for the first time since the band&#x27;s break-up. Like its predecessor, the album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and has been certified 4× Platinum by the RIAA.

The &quot;Anthology&quot; albums were remastered and made available digitally on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, individually and as part of the &quot;Anthology Box Set&quot;.

==Content==
&quot;Real Love&quot;, as with &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;, is based on a demo made by John Lennon and given to Paul McCartney by Lennon&#x27;s widow, Yoko Ono. The three surviving Beatles (McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) added guitars, bass, drums, percussion and backing vocals, but unlike with the previous song, did not re-work the lyrics or music. &quot;Real Love&quot; remained solely credited to Lennon, becoming the only Beatles song to have Lennon by himself in the writing credit.

Disc one contains three unreleased compositions, one being an instrumental entitled &quot;12-Bar Original&quot;, recorded for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; but subsequently unused. Two other songs recorded for &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got Trouble&quot; and &quot;That Means a Lot&quot;, were abandoned and never returned to again by the band. The former was originally slated to be the usual vocal spot for Ringo Starr on &quot;Help!&quot;, and the latter was eventually given to singer P.J. Proby. The version of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot; from the group&#x27;s famed August 1965 show at Shea Stadium but left out of the documentary about the show appears for the first time.

&quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; was originally listed as Track 7 (in its correct place chronologically) but was shifted out of sequence to Track 3 at the last minute, at Paul McCartney&#x27;s request. The album had already gone to press and McCartney reportedly paid the re-printing costs himself.

Disc two contains work-in-progress versions of tracks from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. The take of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; that made up the first minute of the released record appears in its entirety on track three. Also included are three songs that were started during this period – &quot;Only a Northern Song&quot;, &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; – but would not see release until years later, in 1969 and 1970.

McCartney had hoped to include &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, an unreleased experimental piece that the Beatles recorded during the sessions for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in 1967; however, the idea was vetoed by Harrison, Starr and Ono on the grounds that the track was never intended for a Beatles release. Among the songs that were in the running for inclusion on the compilation but ultimately passed over were the following: the 1965 Shea Stadium performance of &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;; a live version of &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, recorded in Tokyo in 1966; &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, featuring only vocals; and out-takes of &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; and &quot;Love You To&quot;.

==Reception==
Like its predecessor, &quot;Anthology 2&quot; sold well. In the United States, it debuted at number one, selling 442,000 copies its first week. The next week, it fell to number two, selling 201,000 copies, being replaced by Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. The album spent two more weeks on the top 10, at number four then number eight, remaining on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 22 consecutive weeks and then re-entering the charts twice, marking a number 96 reach during the Christmas season of 1996. In all, the album spent 37 weeks on the charts (eight more than &quot;Anthology 1&quot;) and sold 1,707,000 copies. In the United Kingdom, the success was similar. The first &quot;Anthology&quot; album had debuted at number two when it was released in November 1995, but its successor reached number one, where it remained for one week. The album spent a total of 13 weeks on the UK Albums Chart.

Reviewing the compilation in March 1996, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer described it as a &quot;precious window into the most lucrative creative collaboration in the history of popular music&quot;.

<text>Lockleaze is an area and council ward in the northern suburbs of the city of Bristol, England, north of the city centre, south of Filton, east of Horfield and west of Frenchay.

Lockleaze is a residential area of social housing built on the western flank of Purdown on a north–south axis, that was initially separated from Horfield by the main Bristol to South Wales railway line. The suburb was developed immediately after World War II. Although much of the housing was owned by Bristol Corporation, some are now privately owned. The Lockleaze council ward was extended to include older Bristol council housing and the border with Horfield is the thoroughfare, Filton Avenue.

Lockleaze School was designed by the city architect A.H. Clarke and built in 1954. It is an early example of &#x27;Method Building&#x27; using pre-cast frame with pre-stressed floors and brick panel walling. The school closed in July 2004.

St Mary&#x27;s Church dates from 1956 by T.H.B. Burrough.

A microwave transmission tower, Purdown BT Tower, is located at Lockleaze and is known locally as the &quot;Cups and Saucers&quot;. The distinctive tower, built in 1970, can be seen from many miles away.

During World War II, an anti-aircraft gun emplacement, known locally as Purdown Purcy, was located on the down, the ruins of which remain today.

==History==

The estate takes its name from Lockleaze Farm, which occupied the site. The name &quot;Lock Leaze&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon for a fold in a field or pasture. Lockleaze Farm stood roughly where Bonnington Walk is today, between Stothard Road, Branwhite Close and Thornycroft Close. The farm stood at the end of Lockleaze Lane; neither the lane nor the farm buildings remain today. Lockleaze Lane was a continuation of Berry Lane, which began at the junction between Gloucester Road and the present-day Muller Road, at Horfield Court Farm. The lane followed the route of Muller Road, Filton Avenue, Berry Lane and Chedworth Road, before crossing the gas works and crossing the railway at the present day Constable Road/Lockleaze Road bridge. On the south side of Chedworth Road stood Berry Lane Farm. As well as Lockleaze Farm there was also Purdown Farm which stands at the site of present-day Fairacre Close. The old farmhouse remained long after the houses were built at Haydon Gardens.

Nearly all the roads in Lockleaze are named after painters, such as Constable, Gainsborough, Blake, Hogarth and Nash.

==Amenities==
The hub of Lockleaze is Gainsborough Square, where shops face onto the north and west sides of the Square. 
On the east side of the Square, a new community centre has been built, named The Hub. 
At the south side of the Square is the Church of St. Mary Magdalene with St. Francishe.
The central green area of Gainsborough Square serves as a small park, with an enclosed child&#x27;s play area.

The nearest police station is on Southmead Road, in the neighbouring district of Southmead. Lockleaze once had its own police station on Gainsborough Square.

A doctor&#x27;s surgery is located on Lockleaze Road.

Lockleaze is served by a bus service operated by First West of England, with several bus stops throughout Lockleaze.

==Famous people==
*Boxer Lee Haskins was born in Lockleaze
*Robin Boardman-Pattison, a senior Extinction Rebellion personality known for storming off a Sky News interview, lived in Lockleaze

==In popular culture==
The Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Teachers&quot; was filmed at Lockleaze school. Lockleaze provided a backdrop in the 1962 film &quot;Some People&quot; directed by Clive Donner, starring Kenneth More, Angela Douglas and Ray Brooks. The film is about a youth worker (Kenneth More) trying to help a group of teenagers in Bristol. In the film, several Lockleaze landmarks were shown, including Purdown, the communication tower and the large gas holders which once stood just off Lockleaze Road. Lockleaze was also the setting for the series finale of BBC Three&#x27;s 2016 drama miniseries &quot;Thirteen&quot;, starring Jodie Comer.

<doc id="991784" wikidata="Q1414689" url="?curid=991784" title="Circumscribed sphere">
<text>In geometry, a circumscribed sphere of a polyhedron is a sphere that contains the polyhedron and touches each of the polyhedron&#x27;s vertices. The word circumsphere is sometimes used to mean the same thing, by analogy with the term &quot;circumcircle&quot;. As in the case of two-dimensional circumscribed circles (circumcircles), the radius of a sphere circumscribed around a polyhedron is called the circumradius of , and the center point of this sphere is called the circumcenter of .

==Existence and optimality==
When it exists, a circumscribed sphere need not be the smallest sphere containing the polyhedron; for instance, the tetrahedron formed by a vertex of a cube and its three neighbors has the same circumsphere as the cube itself, but can be contained within a smaller sphere having the three neighboring vertices on its equator. However, the smallest sphere containing a given polyhedron is always the circumsphere of the convex hull of a subset of the vertices of the polyhedron.

In &quot;De solidorum elementis&quot; (circa 1630), René Descartes observed that, for a polyhedron with a circumscribed sphere, all faces have circumscribed circles, the circles where the plane of the face meets the circumscribed sphere. Descartes suggested that this necessary condition for the existence of a circumscribed sphere is sufficient, but it is not true: some bipyramids, for instance, can have circumscribed circles for their faces (all of which are triangles) but still have no circumscribed sphere for the whole polyhedron. However, whenever a simple polyhedron has a circumscribed circle for each of its faces, it also has a circumscribed sphere.

==Related concepts==
The circumscribed sphere is the three-dimensional analogue of the circumscribed circle.
All regular polyhedra have circumscribed spheres, but most irregular polyhedra do not have one, since in general not all vertices lie on a common sphere. The circumscribed sphere (when it exists) is an example of a bounding sphere, a sphere that contains a given shape. It is possible to define the smallest bounding sphere for any polyhedron, and compute it in linear time.

Other spheres defined for some but not all polyhedra include a midsphere, a sphere tangent to all edges of a polyhedron, and an inscribed sphere, a sphere tangent to all faces of a polyhedron. In the regular polyhedra, the inscribed sphere, midsphere, and circumscribed sphere all exist and are concentric.

When the circumscribed sphere is the set of infinite limiting points of hyperbolic space, a polyhedron that it circumscribes is known as an ideal polyhedron.

==Point on the circumscribed sphere==
There are five convex regular polyhedra, known as the Platonic solids. All Platonic solids have circumscribed spheres. For an arbitrary point formula_1 on the circumscribed sphere of each Platonic solid with number of the vertices formula_2, if formula_3 are the distances to 
the vertices formula_4, then 
:formula_5

<doc id="991786" wikidata="Q683362" url="?curid=991786" title="Inscribed sphere">
<text>In geometry, the inscribed sphere or insphere of a convex polyhedron is a sphere that is contained within the polyhedron and tangent to each of the polyhedron&#x27;s faces. It is the largest sphere that is contained wholly within the polyhedron, and is dual to the dual polyhedron&#x27;s circumsphere.

The radius of the sphere inscribed in a polyhedron &quot;P&quot; is called the inradius of &quot;P&quot;.

==Interpretations==
All regular polyhedra have inscribed spheres, but most irregular polyhedra do not have all facets tangent to a common sphere, although it is still possible to define the largest contained sphere for such shapes. For such cases, the notion of an insphere does not seem to have been properly defined and various interpretations of an &quot;insphere&quot; are to be found:
* The sphere tangent to all faces (if one exists).
* The sphere tangent to all face planes (if one exists).
* The sphere tangent to a given set of faces (if one exists).
* The largest sphere that can fit inside the polyhedron.

Often these spheres coincide, leading to confusion as to exactly what properties define the insphere for polyhedra where they do not coincide.

For example, the regular small stellated dodecahedron has a sphere tangent to all faces, while a larger sphere can still be fitted inside the polyhedron. Which is the insphere? Important authorities such as Coxeter or Cundy &amp; Rollett are clear enough that the face-tangent sphere is the insphere. Again, such authorities agree that the Archimedean polyhedra (having regular faces and equivalent vertices) have no inspheres while the Archimedean dual or Catalan polyhedra do have inspheres. But many authors fail to respect such distinctions and assume other definitions for the &#x27;inspheres&#x27; of their polyhedra.

McKenzie was born in the London Borough of Brent and grew up in Wallington in the London Borough of Sutton. She is the youngest of three children. Her parents, Tony and Lesley McKenzie, divorced in 1987.

==Career==
In early 1994, when McKenzie was 15, she sent sample glamour photographs to local modelling agencies. She began her modelling career by glamour modelling and swimsuit work, intending to progress to topless modelling when she turned 16 later that year.
As McKenzie approached her 16th birthday, the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; tabloid newspaper expressed an interest in turning her topless debut into a media event. Throughout June and July 1994, it published pictures of McKenzie, counting down the days until it could legally show her topless.

After she turned 16, McKenzie continued to model topless for the &quot;Daily Sport&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Sport.&quot; She also made Page 3 appearances in tabloid newspapers &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Daily Star&quot;; posed topless in lads&#x27; mags such as &quot;Loaded&quot;; appeared fully nude in British magazines such as &quot;Mayfair&quot;  and &quot;Men Only&quot;; and performed in a variety of softcore videos.

On 29 July 1995, shortly before her 17th birthday, McKenzie did a topless streak at a televised cricket match between England and the West Indies at Old Trafford. Wearing only a thong and a pair of trainers, she ran onto the field with the words &quot;Only Teasing&quot; written across her breasts.

After McKenzie turned 18 in 1996, she made her North American modelling debut in the breast fetishism magazine &quot;Score&quot;, which marked the occasion by making McKenzie the cover girl of its December 1996 &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; issue.

In the late 1990s, McKenzie was frequently featured on the adult-oriented channels L!VE TV and Television X. She continued to appear regularly in magazines, DVDs, Internet sites, and broadcast media until late 2004, when she took a break from modelling to have a child and undergo a breast reduction operation.

A biography of McKenzie, &quot;Temptress: The Linsey Dawn McKenzie Story&quot;, was published in 2015.

==Appearances==

McKenzie&#x27;s mainstream television appearances include the BBC sporting quiz show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, the reality television shows &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot; and &quot;The Salon&quot;, and the science programme &quot;.&quot; In the United States, she appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in January 2003. On 8 September 2007, she appeared on a special charity edition of the BBC quiz show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, on which all contestants were glamour models who were dating or married to footballers. In December 2010, she featured with her husband Mark Williams on an episode of Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Four Weddings&quot;. The episode also featured actress Tina Malone, &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant Spencer Smith and magician Paul Daniels and his wife, Debbie McGee.

Additionally, McKenzie has appeared in two documentaries about the lives of glamour models, &quot;The Curse of Page 3&quot;; and &quot;Girls Behaving Badly&quot;. She also played the character Beryl fforbes-Juggs in Martin Gooch&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Amazing Things&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1996, McKenzie became involved in an extramarital affair with 27-year-old footballer Dean Holdsworth, who then played for Wimbledon F.C. The relationship received widespread attention in the British media.

In 1998, she became engaged to actor Michael Greco, who at the time was playing the role of Beppe di Marco in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She twice became pregnant over the course of her 15-month relationship with Greco, but miscarried both times.

McKenzie began dating 21-year-old Terry Canty in 2000. The couple married on 21 April 2001 and Canty performed with McKenzie in her first heterosexual hardcore photoshoots and video. Scenes featuring the couple were released on the 2001 DVD &quot;Ultimate Linsey.&quot; The couple separated six weeks after their wedding, and they divorced in 2001.

In 2004, McKenzie began a relationship with former Wimbledon F.C. and Northern Ireland footballer Mark Williams. On 16 May 2005, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s baby boy. McKenzie married Williams on 5 January 2006.

<doc id="991796" wikidata="Q5972982" url="?curid=991796" title="IPCC Summary for Policymakers">
<text>The Summary for policymakers (SPM)

is a summary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports intended to aid policymakers. The form is approved line by line by governments: &quot;Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy.&quot;

==Process==
The IPCC is divided into three &quot;Working Groups&quot; (WG) covering a section of the human-caused climate change topic:

* Working Group I (WGI): The Physical Science Basis.
* Working Group II (WGII): Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
* Working Group III (WGIII): Mitigation of Climate Change

Approximately every five years, each Working Group prepares a full &quot;assessment report&quot; by collating all the available research results.

Before the end of this period, a selection of about 50 scientists within each Working Group produces a first draft &quot;Summary for policymakers&quot; (SPM) summarizing its section of the full assessment report. This first draft SPM is sent for comments to the participating government. Comments are taken into account in a second draft prepared by the scientists. When the full assessment report is finalized, each second draft SPM is then reviewed during a four days plenary session comprising government delegations and observer organizations. Each reviewing session is chaired by the scientists chairing the Working Group, surrounded by a panel of scientists. The government delegations usually consist of one to six delegates, comprising generally a mix of national experts (some of which are part of the IPCC) and a few diplomats or other non-scientist civil servants.

The objective of the review session is to improve the form of the SPM, which must remain faithful to the scientific content of the full assessment report. This process also results in some form of endorsement by the participating governments.

For the Fourth Assessment SPMs, each review lasted three days. The beginning of the first day was open to journalists and started with introductory speeches (from the IPCC President, local politicians, etc.). Then each sentence of the draft SPM, displayed on a giant screen, was discussed at length by the delegates and often ended up completely rewritten. Some paragraphs were removed and others are added, under the full control of the Chair and its panel of scientist who ensured that every sentence strictly conforms to the content of the full assessment. When the discussion on a sentence lasted too long, a subgroup chaired by a scientist was formed to craft aside a revised text for later submission to the plenary. Generally the process was very slow at the beginning: in some cases, as little as a few paragraphs were reviewed at the end of the first day. The review generally ended late in the night of the third day – sometimes even in the next morning. On the fourth day, the reviewed SPM was released during a closing session open to journalists.

==Support for the IPCC process==
The IPCC process has received widespread support and praise from major scientific bodies. In 2001, a joint statement on climate change was made by sixteen national academies of science. The IPCC process was supported by these academies:
The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science. We recognise IPCC as the world&#x27;s most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus.
Some IPCC authors have expressed their personal support for the process that produces the Summary for Policymakers document. John Houghton, who was formerly a co-chair of IPCC Working Group I, has stated:
It is important to note that IPCC Policymakers&#x27; Summaries are agreed unanimously at intergovernmental meetings involving over 200 government delegates from around 100 countries. This agreement is only achieved after several days of scientific debate (only scientific arguments not political ones are allowed) the main purpose of which is to challenge the scientific chapter authors regarding the accuracy, clarity and relevance of the summary and most especially its consistency with the underlying chapters. Agreement at such a meeting has ensured that the resulting document, so far as is possible, is scientifically accurate, balanced and free from personal or political bias.
Martin Parry, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II Fourth Assessment Report, has said:
The SPM is chewed over for some days (and sometimes nights) by the panel; and it is this process that has sometimes brought criticism from a few scientists who have questioned how much this government involvement alters the meaning of the scientists&#x27; conclusions.

I do not think it does; Plenary might alter some nuances, but the key conclusions of the assessments remain intact.

IPCC author Terry Barker has commented on the IPCC process and Summary for Policymakers document:My impressions of the IPCC process is that it is an open, highly innovative and progressive means to address the issue, namely the organisation of the scientific policy-relevant advice to governments of an evolving, complex and highly contentious topic. ...

My experience in the 2001 [IPCC] process was that political considerations inevitably play a role in the development of the SPM, since governments will not necessarily agree with the scientific consensus expressed in the initial drafts of the [Summary for Policymakers] SPM. Since there is always some uncertainty in the scientific findings, reasons can always be found to qualify or remove unpalatable conclusions. Whether the political considerations introduce a large gap between what the authors say in the Report and what appears in the SPM is a matter of opinion.

==US National Research Council comments==
In 2001, the Bush Administration asked the US National Research Council to produce a report on climate change. The committee writing this report was asked, among other things, to comment on the IPCC Working Group I Third Assessment Report and its Summary for Policymakers:

The committee finds that the full IPCC Working Group I (WGI) report is an admirable summary of research activities in climate science, and the full report is adequately summarized in the &quot;Technical Summary&quot;. The full WGI report and its &quot;Technical Summary&quot; are not specifically directed at policy. The &quot;Summary for Policymakers&quot; reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change. This change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document. Written responses from U.S. coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate, however, that (a) no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors (this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors) and (b) most changes that did occur lacked significant impact.

==Debate about Working Group I&#x27;s 2001 summary==
IPCC authors Kevin E. Trenberth and Richard Lindzen have criticized past editions of the SPM, alleging that the summary does not completely represent the full report. However, their criticisms were diametrically opposite: Trenberth arguing that the summary diluted the main report, Lindzen arguing that it was too alarmist.

Kevin E. Trenberth, a lead author of the 2001 IPCC Working Group I report, wrote:
The rationale here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but the governments determine how it can best be said.. ... The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report. ... In spite of these trials and tribulations, the result is a reasonably balanced consensus summary. ...

IPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the IPCC. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report.
The report is prefaced by a policymakers&#x27; summary written by the editor, Sir John Houghton, director of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. His summary largely ignores the uncertainty in the report and attempts to present the expectation of substantial warming as firmly based science.
Lindzen has stated that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. John Houghton has responded to Lindzen&#x27;s criticisms of the SPM. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world&#x27;s governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence (see above).

<text>Teachers is a British television comedy-drama series, created by Tim Loane and originally shown on Channel 4. The series follows a group of secondary school teachers in their daily lives.

In the first series, probationary teacher Simon Casey (Andrew Lincoln) is the protagonist; later series have an ensemble cast. The cast changes dramatically, with few original characters remaining by the fourth series. While some of these disappearances are explained, others are not.

The first three series are set in the fictional Summerdown Comprehensive, which merges with another school in the fourth series to form Wattkins School. The first three series were filmed at the former Merrywood School and the fourth was filmed at the former Lockleaze school in Bristol, England.

&quot;Teachers&quot; was nominated for six BAFTA awards between 2002 and 2004, and was nominated for &quot;Best Comedy Drama&quot; at the British Comedy Awards in 2003. In January 2005, after a muted reception to the fourth series, Channel 4 announced that &quot;Teachers&quot; would not continue for a fifth series. A short lived American version was aired in 2006.

Since mid-2020 the series has been available on UK and Australian Netflix. The series is also available on All 4 and PlutoTV streaming service.

==Cast==

==Episodes==

==Themes==
Like many sitcoms &quot;Teachers&quot; had certain themes that it maintained through every episode. These included:
*Appearances of animals, particularly donkeys, in unusual places. Others seen include lions, penguins and sheep. In all such appearances, the teachers and students are completely oblivious to these animals.
*A staffroom scene early in the episode, usually with an announcement by the head teacher Clare to set up one of the plots or premises of the episode.
*The name of the day written in a variety of ways in the scenery, a prop or a body adornment.
*Smoking: a lot of the scenes in all episodes, primarily through the first three series, feature members of the cast smoking as they banter
*The pub is the setting where nearly every episode of &quot;Teachers&quot; starts, usually with the teachers having immaturely themed conversations.

Every episode featured contemporary music, usually with clips of at least five songs (regularly including the bands The Bluetones, Terrorvision, The Soundtrack of our Lives, The Killers, The Darkness, Shed Seven, Feeder, The Dandy Warhols, Starsailor, Mercury Rev, The Hives, Athlete, I Am Kloot, The Libertines, Ash, and Supergrass), and the soundtrack to all four series has been released on CD by the shop of Channel 4.

The theme tune is the solo section of &quot;The Boy With The Arab Strap&quot; by Belle and Sebastian.

<text>Ezekiel Cornell (27 March, 1733 – April 25, 1800) was a Revolutionary War general who represented Rhode Island in the U.S. Continental Congress from 1780 to 1782.

==Early life==
Ezekiel Cornell was born on March 27, 1733 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts to Richard Cornell and Content Brownell. He was a descendant of Thomas Cornell. Ezekiel Cornell married Rachel Wood of Little Compton on March 25, 1760, and they had two surviving children, Ezra and Rhoda. Cornell attended the public schools and was employed as a mechanic. Cornell served as Scituate&#x27;s town meeting moderator in 1768, 1781 and 1785 and as a Deputy (Representative) from Scituate to the General Assembly in 1772, 1774 and 1775.

In August 1774 he was commissioned as the colonel of the 3rd Providence County Regiment of the Rhode Island Militia.

==Revolutionary War service==
During the American Revolution Cornell, nicknamed &quot;Old Snarl,&quot; was appointed lieutenant colonel in Hitchcock&#x27;s Regiment in April 1775 and was present at the Siege of Boston. The unit and fought at Bunker Hill in June 1775 and was taken into the Continental Army when General George Washington arrived in July to take command. Following the British evacuation of Boston in March 1776, the army was redeployed to Long Island in September 1776.

On Long Island he occupied the former British controlled St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church (Hempstead, New York), which had been founded by relatives of Cornell including his cousin William Cornell, and was a hotbed of Tory sentiment, and Cornell sought to root out Loyalists. Cornell &quot;converted the Episcopal Church into a store house, forbid the parson to pray for the King or any of the Royal Family and made use of the communion table as a convenience for his Yankees to eat upon.&quot;

Cornell was part of the Continental Army contingent, dispatched by General Nathaniel Greene that arrested Loyalist Mayor of New York David Mathews on June 22, 1776, on suspicion of Mathews&#x27; participation in the plot by Thomas Hickey to kill General George Washington.

Cornell left Hempstead sometime before August 1776. On October 1, 1776, Cornell was appointed Deputy Adjutant General of the Continental Army. Cornell resigned from the Continental Army in December 1776 and returned to Rhode Island.

Cornell was appointed brigadier general of Rhode Island state troops on December 1, 1777, and served until March 16, 1780. He commanded a brigade of state troops consisting of two infantry regiments of eight companies each and an artillery regiment of four batteries. Cornell played an active role at the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778.

==Continental Congress service==
Cornell served as a member of the Continental Congress from 1780 until 1782 and chaired the military committee. After his service in Congress, he retired to his farm at Scituate, Rhode Island.

Ezekiel Cornell died in Milford, Massachusetts on April 25, 1800. His site of burial is unknown.

<text>ISO 15924, Codes for the representation of names of scripts, is an international standard defining codes for writing systems or &lt;dfn&gt;scripts&lt;/dfn&gt; (a &quot;set of graphic characters used for the written form of one or more languages&quot;). Each script is given both a four-letter code and a numeric code.

Where possible the codes are derived from ISO 639-2, where the name of a script and the name of a language using the script are identical (example: Gujarātī ISO 639 guj, ISO 15924 Gujr). Preference is given to the 639-2 Bibliographical codes, which is different from the otherwise often preferred use of the Terminological codes.

4-letter ISO 15924 codes are incorporated into the IANA Language Subtag Registry for IETF language tags and so can be used in file formats that make use of such language tags. For example, they can be used in HTML and XML to help Web browsers determine which typeface to use for foreign text. This way one could differentiate, for example, between Serbian written in the Cyrillic (codice_1) or Latin (codice_2) script, or mark romanized or transliterated text as such.

==Maintenance==
ISO appointed the Unicode Consortium as the Registration Authority (RA) for the standard. The RA is responsible for appointing a registrar who works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard. The registrar from 2004 to 2018 was Michael Everson, and from January 2019 the registrar has been Markus Scherer of Google. The JAC consists of six members: one representative of the RA (Markus Scherer), one representative of ISO 639-2 (Randall K. Barry of the Library of Congress), one representative of ISO TC37 (Christian Galinski), one representative of ISO TC46 (Peeter Päll), and two representatives of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 (Rick McGowan and Jan Kučera, both affiliated with the Unicode Consortium).

==Script codes==
===Numeric ranges===
* Hieroglyphic and cuneiform scripts
* Right-to-left alphabetic scripts
* Left-to-right alphabetic scripts
* Alphasyllabic scripts
* Syllabic scripts
* Ideographic scripts
* Undeciphered scripts
* Shorthands and other notations
* (unassigned)
* Private use, alias, special codes

===Special codes===
*: 50 Codes reserved for private use (for example, is defined in LDML to mark Burmese text encoded for the Zawgyi font)
*: Emoji
*: Code for inherited script
*: Mathematical notation
*: Symbols
*: Code for unwritten documents
*: Code for undetermined script
*: Code for uncoded script

===Exceptionally reserved codes===

Two four-letter codes are reserved at the request of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) project:
*: Reserved for the language-neutral base of the CLDR locale tree
*: Reserved for the Boolean value &quot;true&quot;

==List of codes==
This list of codes is from the ISO 15924 standard.
==Relations to other standards==
The following standards are referred to as indispensable by ISO 15924.
* ISO 639-2:1998 Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 2: Alpha-3 code
* ISO/IEC 9541-1:1991 Information technology — Font information interchange — Part 1: Architecture
* ISO/IEC 10646-1:2020 Information technology — Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS)

For definition of font and glyph the standard refers to
* ISO/IEC 9541-1:1991

Around 160 scripts are defined in Unicode. Through a linkpin called &quot;Property Value Alias&quot;, Unicode has made a 1:1 connection between a script defined, and its ISO 15924 standard. See Script (Unicode).

<doc id="991812" wikidata="Q1753632" url="?curid=991812" title="Anthology 3">
<text>Anthology 3 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 28 October 1996 by Apple Records as part of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; series. The album includes rarities and alternative tracks from the final two years of the band&#x27;s career, ranging from the initial sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot; (better known as &quot;the White Album&quot;) to the last sessions for &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; in 1969 and early 1970. It is the last in a trilogy of albums with &quot;Anthology 1&quot; and &quot;Anthology 2&quot;, all of which tie in with the televised special &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;.

The album was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA and was the group&#x27;s third double album in a row to reach number one on the US charts, equalling a record set by Donna Summer in the 1970s.

The &quot;Anthology&quot; albums were remastered and made available digitally on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, individually and as part of the &quot;Anthology Box Set&quot;.

==Content==
Following &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; on &quot;Anthology 1&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot; on &quot;Anthology 2&quot;, a third John Lennon solo demo entitled &quot;Now and Then&quot; was to be reworked by the three surviving members of The Beatles (George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) for &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. However, this project was shelved due to Harrison&#x27;s dislike of the quality of the song recording. McCartney later stated that Harrison called Lennon&#x27;s demo recording &quot;fucking rubbish&quot;. McCartney told &quot;Q Magazine&quot; in 1997 that &quot;George didn&#x27;t like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn&#x27;t do it.&quot; The song would eventually be finished and released in 2023. In its place is &quot;A Beginning&quot;, an orchestral instrumental track by the band&#x27;s producer George Martin, initially intended for the White Album as the intro to &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;.

Connecting to the previous &quot;Anthology&quot; albums, the cover image painted by Klaus Voormann features a collage of Beatles-related imagery designed to appear as a wall of peeling posters and album covers. An updated picture of Voormann can be seen in Harrison&#x27;s hair in a segment of the &quot;Revolver&quot; album cover.

<doc id="991818" wikidata="Q2445850" url="?curid=991818" title="D-pad">
<text>A D-pad (short for directional pad) is a directional input method developed for video games. The flat plastic top is typically operated by a person&#x27;s thumb. The plastic rests on four internal switches, each functioning like a push-button. When a person presses a direction on the D-Pad, it will press down one of the switches (for up, right, down, or left) or press down two of the switches (for diagonal directions), offering eight total directions at 45-degree intervals. Most D-Pads contain a hard pivot beneath the center of the plastic. This pivot will prevent the plastic from being pressed onto all four buttons and will cause it to tilt in the direction pressed. 

D-pads are found on nearly all modern gamepads and handheld game consoles. Although D-pads offer less flexibility than analog sticks, they offer high accuracy and can be manipulated with minimal movement by the thumb. They require comparatively little maintenance and their minimal profile makes them ideal for portable devices. D-pads have appeared on audiovisual device remote controls, calculators, PDAs, mobile phones, and car stereos. Outside of gaming, some D-pads have a central &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;select&quot; button instead of a pivot point in the center. 

== History ==

A precursor to the D-pad was the usage of four separate directional buttons. This input method was used in arcade video games such as Gremlin&#x27;s &quot;Blockade&quot; (1976) and SNK&#x27;s &quot;Vanguard&quot; (1981). Entex&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Select A Game&quot; cartridge-based handheld system featured left, right, up and down buttons next to a row of action buttons. Similar directional buttons were also used on the Atari Game Brain, the unreleased precursor to the Atari 2600, and on some early dedicated game consoles such as the VideoMaster Star Chess game. The 1981 game &quot;Cosmic Hunter&quot; on Milton Bradley&#x27;s handheld Microvision featured four directional buttons around a fifth button in the center, all under a single rubber membrane.

William F. Palisek patented the D-pad for Tiger Electronics in 1979. In Palisek&#x27;s design, a single piece of plastic rests on a central pivot and four directional switches that provide input and keep the plastic pad resting in a neutral position. Tiger introduced the D-pad on their 1980 handheld game &quot;Deluxe Football with Instant Replay&quot; and called it the &quot;Playmaker&quot; button in their handheld sports products. Media coverage described it as offering &quot;one-button control&quot;. The same year, Mattel released the Intellivision with a unique alternative to the joystick, a smooth freely rotating circular pad that registered presses in up to 16 directions. Internally, a metal spring holds the Intellivision&#x27;s control disc centered above sheets of printed mylar.

Nintendo&#x27;s familiar &quot;cross&quot; design positioned for the left thumb was developed by Ichiro Shirai and used by Gunpei Yokoi for the 1982 handheld adaptation of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade game. The design was popular on subsequent &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; titles, although Nintendo still utilized separate directional buttons on later titles, including the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; handheld game. The design was patented and later earned a Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award.

Initially intended to be a compact control method for &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; handheld games, Nintendo realized that a D-pad would also be appropriate for home consoles and made it the standard directional control for the hugely successful Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System (first released 1983) under the name &quot;+Control Pad&quot;. Part of Nintendo&#x27;s rationale came from the durability of the D-pad and the expectation that controllers would be left on floors and crushed. All major video game consoles since have had a D-pad of some shape on their controllers, until the Nintendo Switch in 2017, which used the older four-button design on its included Joy-Con controller, allowing each Joy-Con to be used as an individual controller for multiplayer games: the optional Switch Pro Controller, and the handheld-only Nintendo Switch Lite, retain the usual D-pad. To avoid infringing on Nintendo&#x27;s patent, most controller manufacturers use a cross in a circle shape for the D-pad.

In 1984, the Japanese company Epoch created a handheld game system called the Epoch Game Pocket Computer. It featured a D-pad, but it was not popular for its time and soon faded. Following the release of the Sega Mega Drive in 1988, Sega coined the term &quot;D button&quot; to describe the pad, using the term when describing the controllers for the Sega Genesis in instruction manuals and other literature. Arcade games, however, have largely continued using joysticks.

Modern consoles, beginning with the Nintendo 64, provide both a D-pad and a compact thumb-operated analog stick; depending on the game, one type of control may be more appropriate than the other. In many cases with games that use a thumbstick, the D-pad is used as a set of extra buttons, all four usually centered on a kind of task, such as using items. Even without an analog stick, some software uses the D-pad&#x27;s 8-directional capabilities to act as eight discrete buttons, not related to direction or on-screen movement at all. &quot;Jam Sessions&quot; for the Nintendo DS, for example, uses the D-pad to select music chords during play.

==Components==
D-pads vary in design but generally have a:

# Circuit board that registers input
# Membrane that is pressed down against the board to complete the circuit
# Hard pivot in the center
# Plastic D-pad &quot;button&quot;

The housing of the controller or other device holds these components together. The central pivot keeps all four directions from being pressed at once and causes the D-pad to tilt into the direction pressed. Outside of gaming, D-pads are used for menu navigation and may lack the central pivot. Some remotes instead have a central &quot;select&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; button. With the increased usage of touchscreens, some applications offer virtual D-pads.

== On non-gaming equipment ==
D-pads appear on a number of menu-driven devices as a simple navigational tool; though superficially similar to those used for gaming devices, they are not optimized for real-time control and therefore can usually accept input from only one direction at a time. Many, though not all, such designs include a trigger button in the center of the button arrangement, usually labeled &quot;Enter&quot;, &quot;OK&quot;, or the like. Some older devices do not have D-pads as such, but simple single-axis, up/down or left/right pads. On some remotes, the D-pad can also be used to control a robot using a signal-compatible receiver.

On remote control devices, the buttons on the D-pad function in the same manner as other buttons, and are generally used to navigate on-screen menus. Though initially not common, the quick success of the DVD format led to wide availability of remote designs with D-pads circa 2000, and most current menu-driven consumer electronics devices include some sort of D-pad on the remote (and, occasionally, on the unit itself).

In addition, many small computing and communications devices, particularly PDAs, mobile phones, and GPS receivers, include D-pads not only for menu navigation but as general input devices similar to a joystick or mouse. Less-sophisticated designs similar to those on remote controls appear on some calculators, particularly scientific and graphing calculators, which use the D-pad for cursor control on multi-line screens, as well as input/output recall, menu navigation, and occasionally direct screen access (graphing calculators in particular allow the use of the D-pad to determine values at specific points on a displayed graph). On programmable units, the D-pad can also be mapped directly, allowing it to be used as a gaming or pointer control.

<text>Schnitzel () is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey. Schnitzel originated as &quot;wiener schnitzel&quot; and is very similar to other breaded meat dishes.

It is often made of pork or chicken, and is typically served with fried potatoes (not peeled), boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, fries (especially in canteens), potato salad, or rice.

====Slovenia====
German Schnitzel translates to Slovene as &quot;zrezek&quot; thus Wiener Schnitzel is called &quot;dunajski zrezek&quot; (Vienna is &quot;Dunaj&quot; in Slovenian). As in Austria a real &quot;dunajski zrezek&quot; is made of veal. Restaurants serving the dish can be found throughout the country, though typically it is made of pork or chicken. &quot;Dunajski zrezek&quot; is usually served with fried or roasted potato and a slice of lemon. Less popular is &quot;pariški zrezek&quot; which is prepared the same way but with no breadcrumbs. In Slovenia, a schnitzel filled with ham and cheese, breaded and fried (cordon bleu) is called &quot;ljubljanski zrezek&quot; (after Ljubljana, the country&#x27;s capital). &quot;Zrezek&quot; can also be grilled, fried, braised or pot roasted.

====Spain====
Schnitzel in Spain is Escalope or Escalopa, although a more common name is filete empanado (lit. breaded steak). There is a version of this dish made with chicken breasts usually called &quot;pechuga empanada&quot;. San Jacobo (commonly) or cachopo (in the region of Asturias) is usually made with veal or pork stuffed with ham and cheese. It is common for Spanish families to have filete empanado or variants together with potato omelettes, on picnics in the countryside or at the beach.

Another variation of this dish is the flamenquín&quot;,&quot; made by putting together pork and a slice of ham, making it into a roll, tarnishing the roll and then frying it. This dish is typical from the Andalusian city of Córdoba.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the dish is called &quot;schnitzel&quot; or &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot;, and is made most commonly of pork, and is often decorated with a caper-filled circle of either genuine anchovies or the Swedish &quot;fake&quot; &quot;ansjovis&quot; (made of brine-cured sprats). It is served with rice, fries, or boiled potatoes, and green peas.

====Switzerland====
Schnitzel, &quot;Schnipo, Wienerschnitzel&quot;, and &quot;Rahmschnitzel&quot; are all popular dishes in Switzerland. &quot;Schnipo&quot; (a schnitzel and fried potato combination) is quite popular. The &quot;Rahmschnitzel&quot; version is made with either veal or pork and topped with a cream sauce, sometimes including mushrooms. The &quot;cordon bleu&quot; variant of schnitzel – two slices of schnitzel (or one with a pocket) filled with cheese, typically Emmentaler or Gruyere, and a slice of ham – is also popular in Switzerland. Also the &quot;Walliser Schnitzel&quot; is a variant in which the meat is not breaded, but is fried in oil and then coated with tomato sauce and raclette cheese.

====Ukraine====
In West Ukraine (former Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), it is known as шніцель &quot;shnitsel′&quot;; in the rest of the country, it is called as відбивна &quot;vidbyvna&quot;, also &quot;&quot;. It is usually made of pork, or sometimes chicken.

====United Kingdom====
The parmo, or Teesside Parmesan, is a schnitzel popular in Middlesbrough, Teesside, and a popular item of take-away food in North East England. It consists of a breaded cutlet of chicken or pork topped with a white béchamel sauce and cheese, usually cheddar cheese.

===Middle East===
====Iran====
Schnitzel is popular in Iran, where it is known as &quot;shenitsel&quot; (). Thought to have been introduced in Persia during the World Wars, &quot;shenitsel&quot; is usually thicker, bigger, spicier, and fried with a more crispy breading than the standard schnitzel. It is customarily served with lemon, French fries, and a variety of boiled vegetables.

Another Iranian dish, &quot;kotlet&quot; (), should not be confused with &quot;shenitsel&quot;. They are small, oval-shaped patties made by deep-frying a mix of ground meat, onion, potato, and herbs.

==== Israel ====

In Israel, the dish (Hebrew: שניצל, &quot;shnitsel&quot;) is a popular food in Israeli cuisine. The meat is typically chicken or turkey breast, in conformance with dietary kashrut laws, which prohibit pork. Additionally, vegetable oils are used for frying, as clarified butter, the preferred cooking fat for Austrian &quot;Wiener schnitzel&quot;, is impermissible for kosher use alongside meat. Before frying, the schnitzel is coated with a mixture of beaten eggs and bread crumbs, sometimes spiced with paprika or sesame seeds. It is usually served with mashed potatoes, French fries, rice, or pasta, accompanied by ketchup, hummus, or vegetable salad.

The schnitzel tradition was brought from Europe to Israel by Ashkenazi Jews. During the early years of the state of Israel, veal was not obtainable, and chicken or turkey proved to be inexpensive and tasty substitutes. Packaged schnitzels are widely available in the frozen food section of most supermarkets. Some frozen schnitzels are breaded patties made from processed chicken or turkey meat, not whole poultry breasts. One can also find in the frozen food section Israeli corn schnitzels alongside other vegan options. Schnitzel is also sold in a pita, alongside hummus, French fries and vegetable salad, in a similar way to falafel. Many falafel stands also offer a schnitzel in a pita.

====Lebanon====
In Lebanon, the dish is normally called escalope. Escalope is a French term and is a broader category of beaten, breaded meat of which Schnitzel is a type. While schnitzels are fried, escalopes need not be, even though it most commonly is. Lebanon likely adopted the French term during the French mandate period of Lebanon.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, the dish is spelled schnitzelm, şinitzel, or şnitzel and pronounced in a similar way to German. It is made of chicken, and is usually served with rice, French fries, or pasta. Sometimes, it may have grilled cheese in it. It is often cooked at home, as it is an easy-to-do kind of food, but some restaurants have it on their menus.

===North America===
====Canada====
In Canada, Schnitzel is often referred to simply as veal cutlet or chicken cutlet, breaded and fried. Often with Italian tomato sauce, parmigiana cheese or mozzarella cheese. It is often topped with red peppers and it is very commonly served as a sandwich.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, Schnitzel is commonly referred to as milanesa. Milanesas are eaten in some regions, often in a &quot;torta&quot; (a sandwich made with &quot;bolillo&quot; or &quot;telera&quot; bread). In northern Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua (due to U.S. influence), it features lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise like a traditional sandwich, but the milanesa is also common in these regions as the main course of a meal. The milanesa &quot;memela napolitana&quot; is made with a thick fried tortilla with a milanesa on top, with ham, tomato sauce and grated cheese. In Mexico, milanesa usually refers to the preparation method; any type of meat that is pounded thin, breaded and fried might be referred to as a milanesa. In the northern state of Nuevo León, perhaps due to the influence of German and Czech immigrants, the dish known as milanesa is extremely popular and stands on its own as a main dish in most restaurants. It is usually served with french fries, refried beans, rice, and a lettuce salad.

====United States====
Fried cutlets are a popular convenience meal; they can be purchased pre-cooked and frozen, and heated at home.
The pork tenderloin sandwich, popular in the Midwest, is made from a breaded pork tenderloin and is very similar to schnitzel. Chicken-fried steak, also called country-fried steak, is nearly identical to schnitzel. It is a breaded and deep-fried beef steak. The beef is generally a shoulder or a round cut, rather than an expensive loin or rib steak. It is usually served with white gravy.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Beef (which may be veal) and chicken schnitzel are both very popular dishes in Australia, particularly in pubs where they are among the most widely available meals. Chicken schnitzel (less so beef) is also sold at many take-away establishments.

Schnitzel in Australia is often served in the form of parmigiana, which is a schnitzel topped with Italian tomato sauce, cheese, and occasionally ham.

At pubs, schnitzel is typically accompanied by chips (French fries), salad, and sometimes bacon. Plain and parmigiana schnitzels are sometimes respectively known by colloquial names &quot;schnitty&quot;, “snitty”, &quot;schnitter&quot;, &quot;parma&quot;, or &quot;parmi&quot;.

===South America===
====Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay====

In Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, this dish, called &quot;milanesa&quot;, consists of a thin slice of beef, chicken, veal, or sometimes pork, and even eggplant or soy. Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other ingredients according to the cook&#x27;s taste (like parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow-fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative. Lemon is commonly squeezed on top of the already cooked milanesa for added flavour.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, such preparations, designated &quot;à milanesa&quot; (Milanese-style), are quite common, especially in the more European-influenced southern region of the country. The meats of choice are beef or chicken, while veal and pork are relatively rare.

====Colombia====
&quot;Schnitzel&quot; presentations are called &quot;chuleta&quot; in Colombia. They are composed of flat pieces of chicken, veal, or mostly pork, covered with flour, and then deep-fried. The &quot;chuleta&quot; is a traditional dish of the Valle del Cauca region.

Other variants of the schnitzel, not all necessarily made with a bread crumb crust, include:
*&quot;Escalope&quot;: A piece of boneless meat that has been thinned out using a mallet, rolling pin, or beaten with the handle of a knife, or merely &#x27;butterflied&#x27;. Although it is usually a thinner cut of meat than found in a schnitzel, the meat of an escalope is also usually coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried.
*&quot;Cordon bleu&quot;: &quot;Blue ribbon&quot; is a thinly pounded piece of meat stuffed with cheese and ham.
*&quot;Valdostana&quot;: Very similar to the cordon bleu, but cheese and ham are not inside but on the top. This dish is from an alpine region in Italy, the Val d&#x27;Aosta.
*Chicken Kiev is unpounded chicken breast rolled around butter and sometimes garlic, then breaded and cooked in a manner similar to &quot;cordon bleu&quot;.
*&quot;Milanesa Napolitana&quot;: This River Plate variant, very popular in Argentina and Uruguay, is made from a beef schnitzel topped with ham, marinara sauce (tomato and garlic), and local mozzarella, then grilled to melt the cheese, usually served with French fries (British: chips).
*Singapore Hainanese pork chop: Served in a gravy with tomatoes, potato wedges, onions and peas, it can be enjoyed with steamed rice and chilli sauce.
*&quot;Piccata&quot; is breaded meat like schnitzel.
*Chicken fingers are chicken breast strips breaded and fried similar to schnitzel.
*Chicken-fried steak is a piece of cube steak coated with seasoned flour, and pan-fried. Popular in the southern United States, it is typically served covered in white gravy.
*&quot;Parmo&quot; is popular in north-east England, particularly Teesside; it is covered in bechamel sauce and served with chips and salad.
*&quot;(Cotoletta alla) Milanese&quot; A dish very similar to the Wiener schnitzel, but fried in butter instead of vegetable oil.

<text>Dream 100 was an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Bauer. It broadcast to Tendring and Essex from studios in Colchester and Ipswich, airing the same music programming as sister station Town 102.

The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio East, as part of a rebrand and merger, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
The station was founded as medium wave outlet Mellow 1557 on 1557 kHz in 1990. The station launched on 7 October 1990 as an easy listening station for Tendring. In 1992 Southern Radio PLC acquired Mellow, as part of a reverse takeover by the Invicta Radio Group, making it part of the same company that owned Invicta FM, Ocean FM, Southern FM, Invicta Supergold and South Coast Radio.

In 1996, Southern Radio sold Mellow on to Radio First, who went on to sell the station to Tindle Radio Ltd on 1 September 1998; on 19 November, it became an FM station and adopted its later name. Despite this name change, the holding company of the radio station was still known as Mellow 1557 Limited, just as it was until it was dissolved in August 2021.

Former pirate radio DJ Bill Rollins had been at the Tendring station through its various evolutions, from day 1 in 1990.

In 2006, Town 102 was started up as a sister to Dream 100 from Ipswich, focused on south Suffolk. Programmes between 0600 and 1900 Monday to Friday and between 0800 and 1200 on Saturday and Sunday were then produced in the Town 102 studios near Ipswich for broadcast on Dream 100. Programmes outside these times were shared with all Anglian Radio stations. From 27 February 2017, all programming was shared with Town 102, using the same playout and announcers but with station-unique idents.

Originally broadcasting on 100.2 MHz from a transmitter site at Telstar Nurseries at Cook&#x27;s Green near Little Clacton in Tendring, Dream moved to the new Clacton Freeview transmitter site in 2011.

==Sale to Bauer and GHR merger==
On 8 February 2019, Dream 100 and Celador&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Dream 100 would join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with Dream 100 retaining its own branding.

In September 2020, the station rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio East and merged with several other local stations. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained. The Town 102 and Dream 100 studio in Ipswich closed.

<text>BOB fm was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to north Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. Programming originated from studios at the Old Pump House in Knebworth Park. Launched as Hertbeat FM in 2001, it was subsumed into Heart Hertfordshire on 31 May 2019 shortly after acquisition by media group Communicorp.

== History ==

=== Early Years: Radio Hertford and Hertbeat FM ===
In October 1998, following seven years of lobbying of the Radio Authority Radio Hertford was granted a Restricted Service Licence to broadcast for a two-week period to Hertford and surrounding areas.

The Radio Authority then invited applications to apply for a long-term Hertford licence. The Radio Hertford consortium submitted a bid to broadcast as Hertbeat FM competing with a rival entrant, Stag FM, backed by The Daily Mail Radio Group. Citing Radio Hertford&#x27;s lobbying of the Radio Authority, trial broadcast and emphasis on local content, the HertBeat FM bid was awarded a licence in February 2000. The station proposed &quot;an imaginative, music-led service, targeted at discerning 25 to 54-year olds, with intelligent speech that emphasises local news and information.&quot;

The Old Pump House at Knebworth Park was converted into radio studios and production offices. Broadcasting commenced on 3 March 2001 with the inaugural show presented by Robbie Owen, founder and a director of the company, his shows continued throughout the life of the station and on for a period under the new management along with Steve Folland, also amongst the original lineup who continued presenting at the station until November 2013. Other programmes included The Ultimate 80&#x27;s which was presented by Nigel Cayne.
The Hertbeat FM slogan was &quot;Broadcasting to Hatfield, Hertford, Stevenage, Ware and Welwyn Garden City this is 1067 &amp;9 Hertbeat FM&quot;.

July 2005 saw Hertbeat FM owner Radio Hertford (Commercial) acquired by Shadow Radio Holdings, led by Brett Harley, resulting in a change of directors.

The station continued offering locally oriented content, music and request shows using a roster of presenters through the day and night.

=== Jack FM ===
On 10 May 2010 HertBeat abruptly rebranded as Jack FM – at that time the third Jack FM licensee operating in the UK. Amongst the reasons for terminating HertBeat was confusion with encroaching rival network Heart.

The Jack format was mostly automated, initially only &quot;Jack&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; with Steve Folland surviving as a presenter-led show but later complemented with a Saturday &quot;Interactive Brunch&quot; topical news show presented by newsreader Chris Hubbard and a Sunday &quot;All Eighties&quot; music show with Brett Harley. The rest of the schedule included music, snippets from &quot;Jack&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;, news and other local content.

In common with the other UK Jack stations many links between segments were provided by the acerbic Voice of Jack, Paul Darrow, recorded at Jack FM Oxfordshire, often tailored for the local audience. Unlike HertBeat, Jack FM rejected listener&#x27;s requests, a stance reinforced by the brand slogan, &quot;Playing what we want&quot;.

In November 2013, as the Jack FM period drew to a close Steve Folland departed the station, replaced by industry veteran Graham Mack.

=== BOB fm ===
The station&#x27;s preparations to broadcast using DAB in addition to FM, triggered another rebranding due to lack of exclusivity of the Jack FM moniker on the DAB multiplex and potential clashes with the growing number of stations then operating as Jack FM franchises.

From January to March 2014 listeners were encouraged to suggest new names for the station. Unlike the sudden transformation to Jack FM, the plan to rename the station was trailed extensively.

The rebranding was announced on 10 March 2014. The final song played by the station as Jack FM Hertfordshire was &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot; by D:Ream, airing shortly before 0800.

At 0808 the station was transformed into BOB fm. The inaugural song was &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; by Ray Charles.

The station emulated Jack FM&#x27;s automated format, with links and catchphrase &quot;Turn your knob to BOB&quot;, provided by Voice of BOB, Jim McCabe.

There was no connection to other broadcasters operating as Bob FM outside the United Kingdom.

BOB fm&#x27;s DAB service ceased in August 2018.

=== Incorporation into Heart Hertfordshire ===
In April 2019, Shadow Radio Holdings was purchased by Communicorp.

Earlier in the year Communicorp had acquired Watford-based Heart Hertfordshire, which broadcasts in south Hertfordshire, from Adventure Radio. The takeover of BOB fm allowed Heart Hertfordshire to extend its reach throughout the county. A transition began in May with Heart-style jingles, slogans and music interspersed amongst its output. Frequent trailers proclaimed &quot;Heart is coming.&quot;

On 31 May 2019, the final live presented show, &quot;BOB&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; with Brett Harley and Chris Hubbard ended with &quot;Are You with Me&quot; by Lost Frequencies. BOB fm ceased broadcasting at 4pm, handing over to Heart Hertfordshire for the station&#x27;s drivetime show from Watford. The closure of BOB fm coincided with programming changes across the wider Heart radio network. The station still retains local news, traffic updates and advertising - with Chris Hubbard continuing to head up the station&#x27;s Breakfast News.

== Ofcom complaints ==

* In 2006 Hertbeat ran advertisements for Stevenage Borough Council during an election period that media regulator Ofcom determined breached rules regarding political content.
* During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum a publicity stunt, involving an on-air rant against Scots and a ban on Scottish music by presenter Graham Mack prompted almost 50 complaints to Ofcom. Ofcom determined the complaints did not warrant investigation.
* A lively conversation in May 2018 between a caller and Graham Mack regarding a local speed camera patrol was reported to Ofcom. The investigation deemed the broadcast to be in breach of rules regarding potential to cause offence. Graham Mack departed the station during July 2018 shortly before the Ofcom adjudication in August to become Programme Director at London-based Fix Radio. Brett Harley replaced Graham Mack as host of BOB&#x27;s Breakfast.

== Awards ==
Graham Mack won &quot;Best Radio Personality&quot; Finalist at the New York Festivals International Radio Awards in 2017. BOB fm developed a reputation for the quality of its local news, under the leadership of News Editor Chris Hubbard. Chris Hubbard won &quot;Newsreader of the Year&quot; at the Independent Radio News (IRN) Awards, having previously been twice shortlisted. The IRN also awarded the accolade of &quot;News Team of the Year&quot; to the station in 2013 and 2016. Its journalists and reports have also been shortlisted for or won several honours.
