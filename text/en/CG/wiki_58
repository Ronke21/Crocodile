<text>The British Rail Class 26 diesel locomotives, also known as the BRCW Type 2, were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRCW) at Smethwick in 1958–59. Forty seven examples were built, and the last were withdrawn from service in 1994. Like their higher-powered sisters, the BRCW Classes 27 and 33, they had all-steel bodies and cab ends with fibreglass cab roofs. They were numbered D5300-D5346.

==Origins==

The BR Modernisation Plan contained a large requirement for small diesel locomotives in the - range and under BR&#x27;s &#x27;Pilot Scheme&#x27;, small batches of locomotives were ordered from numerous different manufacturers for evaluation. BRCW obtained an order for 20 mixed traffic diesel-electric locomotives powered by Sulzer 6LDA28 engines.

The Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company was a rolling stock manufacturer, although they were building diesel multiple units for BR. The first standalone locomotives made by the company were produced in 1956-57 BRCW: 12 diesel locomotives for the Irish railways Córas Iompair Éireann (CIE 101 Class), the order going to BRCW due to capacity problems at CIÉ&#x27;s own Inchicore Works. A partnership was established between BRCW and the Swiss diesel engine manufacturers Sulzer Brothers at that time.

The Sulzer LDA28 range was found to be particularly suited to BR&#x27;s needs. In addition to BRCW&#x27;s Class 26, the 1,160 hp 6LDA28 variant was also used in BR&#x27;s own Class 24 design, while the 1,250 hp 6LDA28-B was fitted in the later BRCW Class 27 and BR Class 25.

==Work history==

The Pilot Scheme batch of twenty locomotives (D5300-5319, Class 26/0) were delivered to Hornsey TMD (Traction Maintenance Depot) on the Eastern Region of British Railways between July 1958 and March 1959. They were used on a variety of duties, notably including London commuter services into King&#x27;s Cross station and were evaluated against designs from the North British Locomotive Company, English Electric, Brush Traction, and British Railways&#x27; own works. Their allocation was switched to the new Finsbury Park TMD when it opened in 1960.

Locomotive D5303 was on loan to the Scottish Region from 1958, being operated briefly from Inverness TMD, and Eastfield TMD before moving to Leith Central TMD. This was the precursor to a further twenty seven locomotives of a slightly modified design (D5320-5346, Class 26/1) being delivered to the Scottish Region between April and October 1959. The first two of these locomotives were briefly allocated to Leith Central, but subsequently all of the Scottish batch were based at Haymarket TMD (although some went to Hornsey on loan for a time).

By the middle of 1960, evaluation of the various Type 2 designs was complete and it was decided to concentrate all of the Class 26s in Scotland. As a result, the Class 26/0s were transferred to Haymarket, displacing the Class 26/1s to Inverness. Although some transferring of individual locomotives between the two depots occurred, the type was then allocated entirely to Haymarket and Inverness until 1987, apart from the brief allocation of a few locomotives to Kittybrewster TMD and Dundee TMD during 1960.

Like other Scottish Region Type 2s, Class 26 could be found on a wide variety of duties during the 1960s and &#x27;70s. The Inverness-based examples were particularly associated with the Far North Line and Kyle of Lochalsh Line, as well as operating south of Inverness on the Highland Main Line. One notable duty, shared with locally based Class 24s, was to operate &#x27;The Royal Highlander&#x27; Inverness to London Euston sleeping car express as far south as Perth, a demanding turn which required three locomotives working in multiple. The Haymarket engines were latterly more associated with goods traffic, and the first seven locomotives (D5300-5306, later renumbered 26007, 26001–006) were given slow speed control apparatus in 1967 for use on MGR coal trains to the then new Cockenzie Power Station.

Upon elimination of BR standard-gauge steam traction in 1968, the &#x27;D&#x27; number prefix was removed and locomotives D5300-5346 became 5300–5346. In 1974 the TOPS numbering system was implemented and Class 26/0s 5300-5319 were renumbered 26007/1-6/20/08-19, while Class 26/1s 5320-7/9-46 became 26028/1-7/9-46. Number 5328 had been withdrawn in 1972 with accident damage.

The availability of surplus Class 37 and 47 locomotives in the late 1970s and early 1980s displaced the Class 26s from passenger workings and from most goods traffic north of Inverness. However, the type continued to operate goods trains throughout the whole of Scotland, taking over duties previously carried out by Class 25 and 27 locomotives. Most of the class were refurbished in the 1980s to extend their lives, being chosen in preference to the newer Class 25 and 27 due to the better reliability of the Class 26s&#x27; lower powered engines.

In May 1987, all of the surviving Class 26s were transferred to Eastfield TMD, except the seven MGR examples which remained at Haymarket until transfer in May 1988. In August 1992, the remaining engines were reallocated to Inverness, although this was essentially a paper exercise as locomotives only returned to their home depot for major maintenance. By this time the service life of the Class 26 locomotives was coming to an end.

===Withdrawals===
The first withdrawal, 5328, occurred as a result of accident damage in 1972. Although the Class 26s were a useful and reliable type, there was a surplus of small diesel locomotives, so any locomotive suffering significant damage was in danger of withdrawal. A further six locomotives were claimed by minor accidents or engine fires between 1975 and 1984. Apart from these, routine withdrawals commenced with three Class 26/0s in 1977, followed by two 26/0s and two 26/1s in 1985. The surviving 33 locomotives were all refurbished examples, and it had originally been intended to keep them in service until around 2000. However, three were lost to minor accidents/fire damage in 1988–89, and the closure of Ravenscraig steelworks in 1991 resulted in a surplus of locomotives. Routine withdrawal of the refurbished locomotives began in 1990, and the last examples were taken out of service in October 1993.

===Liveries===
Nine main livery variants were carried by the class whilst in BR service:
* British Railways green, with grey roofs, white cab window surrounds and a thin white stripe midway up the bodysides. All locomotives were delivered in this livery;
* Within a few years all locomotives received small yellow warning panels on the lower cabfronts;
* From the late 1960s some locomotives received full yellow ends as an interim measure pending repainting into Rail Blue;
* From 1967, repainted locomotives received all-over &#x27;Rail Blue&#x27; with full yellow ends;
* This was soon modified to include yellow cabside window surrounds. All locomotives had received this livery by the mid-&#x27;70s;
* Railfreight grey with yellow cabs, black cab window surrounds and red solebars. Nineteen locomotives repainted in 1985-87 received this livery (26001-8/10/25/6/31/2/4/5/7/8/40/1);
* Railfreight three-tone grey with black cab window surrounds, yellow lower cabsides and yellow/black &#x27;Coal sub-sector&#x27; markings. This livery was applied to eight locomotives repainted in 1988-89 (26001-8);
* &#x27;Civil Link&#x27; (or &#x27;Dutch&#x27;) grey with yellow upper bodysides and lower cabfronts, and black cab window surrounds was applied to fourteen locomotives (26001-5/7/11/25/6/35/6/8/40/3) in 1990–92;
* To mark the impending withdrawal of the class, the first two locomotives (26007 and 26001) were repainted into 1960s style BR green with small yellow warning panels in 1992, at which point 26001 became the first and only Class 26 to be named (&quot;Eastfield&quot;, to commemorate the closure of that depot).

<text>IC 4756 is a large bright open cluster in the constellation Serpens. Known as Graff&#x27;s Cluster, it is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye and considered a fine cluster for binoculars or small telescopes.

IC 4756 is also known as the Tweedledee Cluster (paired with NGC 6633 as Tweedledum), also as the Secret Garden Cluster.

Metallicity of IC 4756 is similar to the Sun, at -0.02 dex.

==Stars==

There are some noteworthy stars in the cluster. HD 172365 is a likely post-blue straggler in the IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.

<doc id="992238" wikidata="Q4979034" url="?curid=992238" title="Brunette Coleman">
<text>Brunette Coleman was a pseudonym used by the poet and writer Philip Larkin. In 1943, towards the end of his time as an undergraduate at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name, including homoerotic stories that parody the style of popular writers of contemporary girls&#x27; school fiction.

The Coleman oeuvre consists of a completed novella, &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot;, set in a girls&#x27; boarding school; an incomplete sequel, &quot;Michaelmas Term at St Brides&quot;, set in a women&#x27;s college at Oxford; seven short poems with a girls&#x27; school ambience; a fragment of pseudo-autobiography; and a critical essay purporting to be Coleman&#x27;s literary apologia. The manuscripts were stored in the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin was chief librarian between 1955 and 1985. Their existence was revealed to the public when Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; and Andrew Motion&#x27;s biography were published in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The Coleman works themselves were finally published, with other Larkin drafts and oddments, in 2002.

At Oxford Larkin underwent a period of confused sexuality and limited literary output. The adoption of a female persona appeared to release his creativity, as in the three years following the Coleman phase he published under his own name two novels and his first poetry collection. Thereafter, although he gradually established his reputation as a poet, his career as a prose writer declined, and despite several attempts he completed no further fiction. Critical reaction to the publication of the Coleman material was divided between those who saw no value in these juvenilia, and those who considered that they cast useful light on the study of the mature Larkin.

==Origins==

In October 1940 Philip Larkin began studying English at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. A prolific writer since childhood, his primary ambition as an undergraduate was to be a novelist rather than a poet. As well as publishing articles and poems in &quot;Cherwell&quot; and &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, he wrote additional unpublished material that included fragments of semi-autobiographical stories exploring homosexual relationships among groups of undergraduates. According to Larkin&#x27;s biographer Andrew Motion these writings, while of no literary value, give an indication of Larkin&#x27;s confused sexuality at that time, and his growing distaste for what he terms &quot;this buggery business&quot;.

From 1942 the character of much of Larkin&#x27;s private writing changed, as a result of his friendship with a fellow undergraduate from St John&#x27;s, Kingsley Amis, who arrived at the university that summer. Amis, a much more confident and assertive character than Larkin, disguised his serious concerns behind a facade of jokes and comic ironies. Larkin soon adopted that style as his own, joining with Amis in composing obscene rhymes and parodies of the Romantic poets they were required to study. In time they extended their efforts to soft-porn fantasies in which, typically, &quot;girls roll[ed] around together twanging elastic and straps&quot;. After Amis&#x27;s departure for the army in early 1943, Larkin made his first attempt at writing from a specifically feminine perspective in a story called &quot;An Incident in the English Camp&quot;, which he subtitled &quot;A Thoroughly Unhealthy Story&quot;. Lacking any salacious content despite its subtitle, the work is written in a pastiche of sentimental women&#x27;s magazine prose. It depicts an undergraduate girl&#x27;s parting from her soldier lover, and ends: &quot;She walked in exaltation through the black streets, her heart glowing like a coal with deep love&quot;.

==Writing==

From his general reading, Larkin had acquired a considerable knowledge of girls&#x27; school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: &quot;stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds&quot;, who lacked &quot;erotic sensibility&quot; and treated the lesbian perspective &quot;too casually&quot;. His intention to write in this genre is expressed in a letter to his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree Finals: &quot;I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story&quot;. The novel was &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot;, a school adventure story in the manner of Dorita Fairlie Bruce or Dorothy Vicary, which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer&#x27;s writing: &quot;Leaving Oxford was like taking a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me&quot;, Larkin later told his biographer.

Larkin&#x27;s letter to Iles does not mention a female pseudonym, although the idea of using one had been in his mind for months. The previous March he had begun writing the imagined autobiography of a supposed lady novelist, &quot;Brunette Coleman&quot;, adapting the name of a well-known contemporary female jazz musician, Blanche Coleman.
Larkin tentatively titled the autobiography &quot;Ante Meridian&quot;; he soon abandoned it, but held on to the Coleman name. According to James Booth, who prepared the Coleman texts for publication in 2002, the adoption of a female persona was in line with the pose of &quot;girlish narcissism&quot; that Larkin was affecting in the summer of 1943: &quot;I am dressed in red trousers, shirt and white pullover, and look very beautiful&quot;. In his letters to Amis, Larkin maintained a straight-faced pretence that Coleman was a real person. Thus in one letter he wrote &quot;Brunette is very thrilled&quot; with a poem written in her name, and in another, &quot;Brunette can stand healthy criticism&quot;.

As he waited for offers of employment through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot;, set in a women&#x27;s college at Oxford and entitled &quot;Michaelmas Term at St Bride&#x27;s&quot;, but did not finish it: &quot;All literary inspiration has deserted me&quot;, he informed Amis on 13 August. Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled &quot;Jill&quot;, about &quot;a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and falls in love with her&quot;. With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, &quot;Bliss&quot;, the first of seven written in the girls&#x27; school idiom. As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that &quot;Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls&#x27; school stories&quot;. This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto &quot;What Are We Writing For&quot;, which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, &quot;to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life ... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth&quot;.

==Works==
The works which Larkin attributed to Brunette Coleman comprise a short piece of supposed autobiography, a complete short novel, an incomplete second novel, a collection of poems and a literary essay.

===&quot;Ante Meridian&quot;===
This fragment of spoof autobiography is distinct from the rest of the Coleman oeuvre in having no relation to girls&#x27; school fiction. It records Brunette&#x27;s early life as the daughter of an eccentric priest, brought up in a tumbledown Cornish cliff-top house. Apart from descriptions of the house and its contents (some of which may be drawn from Larkin&#x27;s own childhood home in Coventry), much of the narrative is taken up with a comical description of an attempt to launch the local lifeboat. Larkin&#x27;s biographer Richard Bradford is struck by the distinctive tone in the fragment, different from anything else written under Coleman&#x27;s name. The text breaks off suddenly; Motion surmises that Larkin abandoned it because he was eager to begin work on the first Coleman novel. Booth describes the prose as &quot;a mix of Daphne du Maurier nostalgia and surreal farce&quot;.

===Novel: &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot;===

====Synopsis====

Marie Moore, a junior pupil at Willow Gables, receives a birthday present of £5 from an aunt. After the banknote is retained for safekeeping by the headmistress, Miss Holden, Marie slyly recovers it but is quickly found out, and is coerced by Miss Holden into giving the money to the school&#x27;s gymnasium fund. When later the banknote goes missing from the fund&#x27;s collection box, Marie is suspected, but protests her innocence despite a savage beating from Miss Holden with assistance from two burly school prefects. Only her friend Myfanwy believes her. Confined in the school&#x27;s punishment room, Marie manages to escape with the help of a domestic servant, and runs away.

Hilary Russell, a prefect and predatory lesbian, lusts after Mary Beech, the school&#x27;s cricket captain. On a night expedition in pursuit of Mary, Hilary catches Margaret Tattenham, a junior, in the act of replacing the £5 note in Miss Holden&#x27;s room. Margaret says she originally took the money as a prank; Hilary agrees not to report her to Miss Holden in return for sexual favours, to which Margaret reluctantly consents. The following morning, Hilary denounces her anyway; Margaret responds by revealing Hilary&#x27;s sexual harassment but is not believed, and is taken to the punishment room where Marie&#x27;s absence is revealed.

Hilary is sent with a search party to find the missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse. She finds Marie, who is miserable and frightened and wants to return to the school whatever the consequences. Margaret confesses that she borrowed the £5 to bet on a horse, and has won £100. She means to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary&#x27;s search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors&#x27; clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend.

Back at the school, Miss Holden overlooks the theft in view of Margaret&#x27;s heroism, although she confiscates the £100 winnings and donates the money to a new swimming pool fund. Marie is exonerated, and her £5 is returned. Mary Beech comes forward to corroborate Margaret&#x27;s accusations against Hilary, who is summarily expelled. Marie and Myfanwy enjoy an emotional reunion in the school sickroom, as life at the school returns to normal, with friendship and forgiveness all round.

====Commentary====
The typescript begins with a dedication page &quot;To Jacinth&quot; (Brunette Coleman&#x27;s imagined secretary). There follows an untitled poem which later appears, slightly altered, as &quot;The School in August&quot; in &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;, the Coleman poetry collection. In the story the surnames of the headmistress and principal girls have been altered in ink throughout the typescript; some of the original names belonged to Larkin&#x27;s real-life acquaintances at Oxford. The presence of a publisher&#x27;s inkstamp on the wallet containing the typescript indicates that the story may have been submitted by Larkin for publication.

Booth argues that, whatever Larkin&#x27;s motive in writing it, the story follows the parameters of schoolgirl fiction with some fidelity. Its main characters all have models within the genre; Marie has much in common with Dorita Fairlie Bruce&#x27;s recurrent character &quot;Dimsie&quot;, while Hilary is likewise based on Dorothy Vicary&#x27;s villainous &quot;Una Vickers&quot; in &quot;Niece of the Headmistress&quot;. The usual themes of friendships, rivalries and injustices are explored, and the ending in reconciliation and future hope is entirely true to type. Some scenes—the savage beating endured by Marie, the lingering descriptions of girls dressing and undressing, Hilary&#x27;s smouldering sexuality—may, Booth asserts, be written with &quot;the lusts of the male heterosexual gaze&quot; in mind but, he continues, the reader looking for explicit pornography will be disappointed. Bradford notes three prose styles combining in the narrative: &quot;cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism ... and ... its writer&#x27;s involuntary feelings of sexual excitement&quot;. Motion finds the tone of the prose frivolous on the surface, yet fundamentally cold and cruel: &quot;Once its women have been arraigned for pleasure they are dismissed; once they have been enjoyed they are treated with indifference&quot;.

===Novel: &quot;Michaelmas Term at St Bride&#x27;s&quot;===

====Synopsis====

In this incomplete story Mary, Marie, Margaret and Myfanwy, friends from Willow Gables, are new undergraduates at St Bride&#x27;s College, Oxford. Mary is disconcerted to find that she is sharing her rooms with Hilary, her old adversary from the school. However, although Hilary still has a roving lesbian eye, she has lost most of her predatory instincts and the two become friends. Mary falls foul of Mary de Putron, the aggressive and authoritarian college games captain; in the hockey trials de Putron makes Mary play out of her normal position, so that performs badly. Hilary subsequently avenges Mary&#x27;s humiliation by seducing de Putron&#x27;s boyfriend, a gauche Royal Air Force officer called Clive, whom she then dumps unceremoniously.

Of Myfanwy&#x27;s doings we learn relatively little. Margaret, still fascinated with horse-racing, sets up her own bookmaking business. Marie discovers psychoanalysis and tries to cure her sister Philippa&#x27;s leather belt fetish. After various efforts prove unsuccessful, the sisters seek solace in alcohol. The later stages of the story introduce Larkin&#x27;s real-life friend, Diana Gollancz, and recount her preparations for a fashionable party. In the final scenes the narrative becomes surreal, as on their alcoholic quest Marie and Philippa are confronted by the knowledge that they are characters in a story, while &quot;real life&quot; is going on in the next room. Marie takes a peep at real life, and decides she would rather stay in the story, which breaks off at this point with a few pencil notes indicating possible ways in which it might have continued.

====Commentary====
Only the first dozen pages of the manuscript are typed; the remainder is handwritten. The surnames of the characters, which were changed in &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot;, are unaltered. The script carries a dedication to &quot;Miriam and Diana&quot;: Miriam was an acquaintance with whom Larkin had discussed lesbian relationships, while Diana Gollancz (&quot;Diana G.&quot; in the story), the daughter of the publisher Victor Gollancz, supplied him with many anecdotes from her schooldays. According to Motion, &quot;St Bride&#x27;s&quot; is recognisably based on Somerville College, Oxford.

In his analysis of the Coleman fiction, Stephen Cooper notes that, as with &quot;Willow Gables&quot;, the narrative voice switches from character to character so that different thoughts, attitudes and perspectives can be expressed. Cooper argues that as the narrative progresses, Larkin&#x27;s concerns (in his Coleman voice) move beyond sexual titillation; he is no longer interested in describing lesbian encounters in voyeuristic detail. Hilary emerges as saviour rather than seducer, as a campaigner against male oppression, and as a figure who &quot;deviates from the cultural norms [yet] can triumph over those who adopt conventional attitudes&quot;. The scenes with sexual content or innuendo are largely confined to the earlier parts of the story. The later parts, which introduce the male characters &quot;Clive&quot; and Hilary&#x27;s other admirer, the contemptible &quot;Creature&quot; are, according to Motion, overlaid with male self-disgust, a theme apparent in Larkin&#x27;s two published novels and in his later poetry. Motion suggests that the loss of erotic impetus, and Larkin&#x27;s apparent fading of interest, are the main reasons why the story peters out.

===&quot;Sugar and Spice: A Sheaf of Poems&quot;===
The typescript of &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; consists of six poems, which in sequence are:
#&quot;The False Friend&quot;
#&quot;Bliss&quot;
#&quot;Femmes Damnées&quot;
#&quot;Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis&quot;
#&quot;Holidays&quot;
#&quot;The School in August&quot;

A seventh poem in pencil, &quot;Fourth Form Loquitur&quot;, has been loosely inserted into the typescript. &quot;Femmes Damnées&quot;, which was printed by John Fuller at the Sycamore Press, Oxford, in 1978, is the only Coleman work published in Larkin&#x27;s lifetime. This poem, and &quot;The School in August&quot;, were included in Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; published in 1988; &quot;The School in August&quot; was omitted from the 2003 revised edition of the collection although, according to Amis, it is the poem that best gives the flavour of the Coleman pastiche. &quot;Bliss&quot; was included in Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; (1992), as part of a letter to Amis.

Motion describes the Coleman poems as &quot;a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes&quot;, mixing elements from writers and poets such as Angela Brazil, Richmal Crompton, John Betjeman and W.H. Auden. Larkin&#x27;s own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend Bruce Montgomery liked them, especially &quot;The School in August&quot;. However, to Amis he writes: &quot;I think all wrong-thinking people ought to like them. I used to write them whenever I&#x27;d seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl ... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying&quot;. Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin&#x27;s early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clichés. They are an early demonstration of Larkin&#x27;s talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of &quot;The School in August&quot;: &quot;And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey&quot;. In Booth&#x27;s view the Coleman poems are among the best Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection &quot;The North Ship&quot; (1945).

===&quot;What Are We Writing For&quot;===
The typescript of the essay is headed by an epigraph, attributed to &quot;The Upbringing of Daughters&quot; by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: &quot;The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom&quot;. The text which follows is, in Motion&#x27;s words, &quot;a homily on how and how not to write for children&quot;. It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: &quot;To be tenacious in evil is the duty of every villain ... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness&quot;. The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman&#x27;s voice, pleads for &quot;the Classic Unities&quot;: Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.

Motion argues that aside from the sometimes facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices. Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in F. W. Bateson&#x27;s &quot;Essays and Criticism&quot; had that journal existed in 1943.

==Critical reception==

Shortly before his death in 1985 Larkin instructed his companion Monica Jones to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955. The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion&#x27;s biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay &quot;Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin&quot;. Rowe saw Larkin&#x27;s adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women. The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin&#x27;s feelings of anger and frustration with his personal sexual failures. More significantly, according to Rowe, Larkin&#x27;s invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years. The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to &quot;the intensest time of my life&quot;; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection &quot;The North Ship&quot; and his novels &quot;Jill&quot; and &quot;A Girl in Winter&quot; were published.

The complete Coleman material, in a collection edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. Booth thought that the material would probably cause &quot;a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it&quot;. Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in &quot;The Observer&quot; doubted the literary value of the works, citing Motion&#x27;s view that the stories were &quot;little more than mild pornography&quot; which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth&#x27;s collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as &quot;drivel&quot; and &quot;sad ramblings&quot;, unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: &quot;Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned.&quot; Unlike serious pornographers, &quot;Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger&quot;. Diski mocks Booth&#x27;s reverential descriptions of the typescripts &quot;as though they were slivers of the True Cross&quot;, and concludes: &quot;Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn&#x27;t got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties.&quot;

Other critics were more positive. The &quot;New Statesman&quot;″s Robert Potts found the stories &quot;entertaining and intriguing for readers familiar with their background and with the genre&quot;, and for the most part charmingly innocent, &quot;especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life&quot;. The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in &quot;The Independent&quot; found the &quot;Willow Gables&quot; fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin&#x27;s &quot;sly Sapphic spin&quot;. In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal &quot;Daedalus&quot;, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin&#x27;s reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, &quot;the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became &#x27;Larkinesque&#x27;—modern English poetry&#x27;s reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation&quot;.

==Influences==
The effects of Larkin&#x27;s Coleman phase are clearly evident in his first novel, &quot;Jill&quot;, in which he makes copious use of &quot;Willow Gables&quot; material. The novelist&#x27;s protagonist, a shy Oxford undergraduate called John Kemp, invents a schoolgirl sister called Jill, initially to impress his arrogant and dismissive room-mate, Christopher Warner. Although Warner displays little interest, the non-existent &quot;Jill&quot; comes to obsess Kemp. He imagines her at Willow Gables School, and writes long letters to her there. In the form of a short story he details her life at the school—now located in Derbyshire rather than Wiltshire as it had been in the Coleman works. The girls&#x27; names are different, but their speech and attitudes closely reflect those of the earlier stories. A lesbian element is introduced through Jill&#x27;s fascination with the cool, detached senior girl Minerva Strachey. Kemp&#x27;s fantasy is disturbed when he meets a real-life Jill, or Gillian; his attempts to match his flight of fancy to reality end in embarrassment and humiliation.

Reviewing the published Coleman material, &quot;The Independent&quot; Richard Canning suggests that the influence of these early works is often discernible in Larkin&#x27;s poetry. Likewise Stephen Cooper, in his 2004 book &quot;Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer&quot;, argues that the stylistic and thematic influences of &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot; and &quot;Michaelmas Term at St Brides&quot; anticipate the poetry&#x27;s recurrent concern with rebellion and conformity. Among examples, Cooper cites Marie&#x27;s refusal in &quot;Willow Gables&quot; to compromise with an unjust authority as reflecting the sentiments expressed in Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Places, Loved Ones&quot; (1954). The reader, says Cooper, &quot;is invited to identify with Marie&#x27;s plight in a manner that foreshadows the empathy felt for the rape victim in &#x27;Deception (1950). When Marie, having escaped from the school, discovers that her freedom is an illusion, she longs to return to the familiar paths. These sentiments are present in poems such as &quot;Poetry of Departures&quot; (1954), &quot;Here&quot; (1961), and &quot;High Windows&quot; (1967).

The spirit though not the name of Brunette was briefly revived during 1945–46, when Larkin renewed his friendship with Amis. Among the stillborn projects planned by the pair was a story about two beautiful jazz-loving lesbian undergraduates. According to Booth, the &quot;feeble plot [was] merely the excuse for lesbian scenes ... far indeed from the originality of Larkin&#x27;s Brunette works of 1943&quot;. &quot;Jill&quot;, completed in 1944, was finally published in October 1946 by The Fortune Press, whose eccentric proprietor Reginald Caton reportedly accepted the book without reading it. Larkin was disappointed by the book&#x27;s critical reception, but by this time his second novel, &quot;A Girl in Winter&quot;, had been accepted by Faber and Faber, and was duly published in February 1947. It received better reviews than &quot;Jill&quot;, and achieved moderately good sales; Booth calls it Larkin&#x27;s &quot;most original and adventurous experiment in fiction&quot;. It is written from the viewpoint of its main female character, Katherine, but otherwise is unrelated to the Coleman phase. Over the following years Larkin began but failed to finish several more novels, in the last of which, &quot;A New World Symphony&quot;, he returned once again to the device of a female protagonist-narrator. The novel was finally abandoned around 1954.

<doc id="992241" wikidata="Q1525928" url="?curid=992241" title="Mississippi State Senate">
<text>The Mississippi State Senate is the upper house of the Mississippi Legislature, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Mississippi. The Senate, along with the lower Mississippi House of Representatives, convenes at the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson. The Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi serves as President of the Senate.

The Senate is composed of 52 senators representing an equal number of constituent districts, with 56,947 people per district (2020 census). In the current legislative session, the Republican Party holds 36 seats while the Democratic Party holds 16 seats, creating a Republican trifecta in the state government.

The Senate can confirm or reject gubernatorial appointments to the state cabinet, commissions, and boards and can create and amend bills.

==Membership, terms and elections==
According to the current Mississippi Constitution, the Senate is to be composed of no more than 52 members elected for four-year terms with no term limits. Districts are reapportioned to reflect population changes, and per the 2020 census, each district has about 56,947 people. To qualify for election, candidates must be at least 25 years old, a qualified elector of the state for the past four years, and be a resident of the district or county they are running to represent for the past two years. All candidates must pay either a $250 fee to their state party executive committee or to the Mississippi Secretary of State if they are running as an independent. Independent candidates must collect 50 signatures to run. Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November during the state general elections. 

If a vacancy occurs in the Senate before June 1, the governor must order an election within 30 days after the vacancy and give a 40-day notice to the appropriate counties where the seat is located. No special election occurs if the vacancy happens after June 1.

==Powers and process==
The state legislature is constitutionally-mandated to meet for 125 days every four years at the start of a new term and 90 days in other years. The Senate reconvenes on a yearly basis on the Tuesday after the first Monday in January. While the Mississippi House of Representatives can extend its sessions, the Senate cannot.

The Senate has the authority to determine rules of its own proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and expel a member with a two-thirds vote of its membership. A majority in the Senate establishes a quorum, though less members can adjourn, though not for more than 3 days without the House&#x27;s consent. Bills can originate in the Senate and must undergo three readings in each house, unless two-thirds of the house dispenses with the rules. Amendments to bills must be approved by both houses. The Senate, in conjunction with the Mississippi House of Representatives, draws and approves both congressional and district boundaries. The congressional boundaries can be vetoed by the governor, while the district boundaries, created by a joint resolution between both houses, cannot be vetoed by the governor.

The governor has the power to veto legislation, but legislators can override the veto with a two-thirds decision. The Senate tries all impeachments referred to it by the House of Representatives. All gubernatorial appointments are subject to approval of the Senate.

==Leadership==
The President of the Senate is Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann, who is Republican. The President pro tempore is Republican Dean Kirby. The Minority Leader is Democrat Derrick Simmons.

The Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi serves as the President of the Senate and has the sole ability to appoint the chairmanships or vice chairmanships of various Senate committees, regardless of party size. They can only cast a legislative vote if required to break a tie. In his or her absence, the President Pro Tempore presides over the Senate. The President Pro Tempore is elected by a majority of senators present, with following elections for the senate secretary, seargent-at-arms, and a doorkeeper. The President Pro Tempore chairs the Senate Rules Committee, oversees the day-to-day operations of the Senate staff, and assumes the responsibilities of the president in their absence.

==Party composition==

Although the Democratic Party retained their majority in the Senate after the 2003 general election, a party switch by Democratic Senator James Shannon Walley of Leakesville in January 2007 threw control of the chamber to the Republicans. Because the Lieutenant Governor Amy Tuck was a Republican, this gave Republicans control of the Senate for the first time since Reconstruction and a de facto majority only on a tie vote. In the November 6, 2007 statewide elections, Democrats won back control of the chamber, however party switches from Senators Nolan Mettetal in February 2008 and Cindy Hyde-Smith in December 2010 gave the Republicans a de facto majority, with Lieutenant Governor Phil Bryant holding the tiebreaker vote. After another party switch in February 2011, the Republicans expanded their majority to 27–24, with one vacancy.

As of 2024, the Mississippi Senate has 36 Republican members and 16 Democratic members.

<text>The Mystic River Bascule Bridge is a bascule bridge spanning the Mystic River in Mystic, Connecticut in the United States. It carries vehicle and foot traffic directly into the tourist district of town via Main Street (U.S. Route 1).

==History==
The counterweighted four bar linkage type bascule bridge was designed by former Otis Elevator Company Chief Engineer Thomas Ellis Brown of New York and built in 1922 by the J. E. FitzGerald Construction Company of New London, Connecticut, according to its historical marker. Its movable span is wide, long, weighs , and employs two concrete-filled counterweights. Until 1928, the bridge carried streetcars of the Groton and Stonington Street Railway.

It is operated by the Connecticut Department of Transportation and opens for approximately five minutes around 2,200 times per year, carrying an average daily traffic of 11,800. It is driven by two direct current motors, and its span is greased and inspected every one hundred openings or two weeks during the winter. From May 1 to October 31, the bridge opens hourly during daylight at 40 minutes past the hour and on demand. It usually raises to let sailboats and yachts pass under.

<text>The Willard InterContinental Washington, commonly known as the Willard Hotel, is a historic luxury Beaux-Arts hotel located at 1401 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Downtown Washington, D.C. It is currently a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Among its facilities are numerous luxurious guest rooms, several restaurants, the famed Round Robin Bar, the Peacock Alley series of luxury shops, and voluminous function rooms. Owned jointly by Carr Companies and InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts, it is two blocks east of the White House, and two blocks west of the Metro Center station of the Washington Metro.

==History==
===Site===
The first structures to be built at 1401 Pennsylvania Avenue NW were six small houses constructed by Colonel John Tayloe III, of The Octagon House, DC, and Mount Airy, Virginia, in 1816. Tayloe leased the six buildings to Joshua Tennison, who named them Tennison&#x27;s Hotel. The structures served as a hotel for the next three decades, the leaseholder and name changing several times: Williamson&#x27;s Mansion Hotel, Fullers American House, and the City Hotel. By 1847, the structures were in disrepair and Tayloe&#x27;s son, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe (of the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House), was desperate to find a tenant who would maintain the structures and run them profitably.

===Willard&#x27;s Hotel===

The current hotel was founded by Henry Willard, a former chief steward on the steamer &quot;Niagara&quot; on the Hudson River, personally suggested by “Ogle” Tayloe&#x27;s second wife, Miss Phoebe Warren, formerly of Troy, New York, in 1847; when he leased the six buildings, combined them into a single structure, and enlarged it into a four-story hotel he renamed Willard&#x27;s Hotel. Willard purchased the hotel property from Ogle Tayloe in 1864, but a dispute over the purchase price and the form of payment (paper currency or gold coin) led to a major equity lawsuit that ended up in the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court split the difference in &quot;Willard v. Tayloe.&quot; 75 U.S. 557 (1869): The purchase price would remain the same, but Willard must pay in gold coin (which had not depreciated in value the way paper currency had).

===Modern Willard Hotel building===
The present 12-story structure, designed by famed hotel architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, opened in 1901. It suffered a major fire in 1922 which caused $250,000 (equivalent to $ as of ), in damages. Among those who had to be evacuated from the hotel were Vice President Calvin Coolidge, several U.S. senators, composer John Philip Sousa, motion picture producer Adolph Zukor, newspaper publisher Harry Chandler, and numerous other media, corporate, and political leaders who were present for the annual Gridiron Dinner.

The Willard family sold its share of the hotel in 1946, and due to mismanagement and the severe decline of the area, the hotel closed without a prior announcement on July 16, 1968. The building sat vacant for years, and numerous plans were floated for its demolition. In 1975, the National American Indian Council announced it had purchased the building for its headquarters. It eventually fell into a semi-public receivership and was sold to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. They held a competition to rehabilitate the property and ultimately awarded it to the Oliver Carr Company and Golding Associates. The two partners then brought in the InterContinental Hotels Group to be a part owner and operator of the hotel. The Willard was subsequently restored to its turn-of-the-century elegance and an office-building wing was added. The hotel&#x27;s reopening on August 20, 1986, amid great celebration, was attended by several U.S. Supreme Court justices and U.S. senators. In the late 1990s, the hotel once again underwent significant restoration.

==Notable guests==
The first group of three Japanese ambassadors to the United States stayed at the Willard with seventy-four other delegates in 1860, where they observed that their hotel room was more luxurious than the U.S. Secretary of State&#x27;s house. It was the first time an official Japanese delegation traveled to a foreign destination, and many tourists and journalists gathered to see the sword-carrying Japanese.

In the 1860s, author Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote that &quot;the Willard Hotel more justly could be called the center of Washington than either the Capitol or the White House or the State Department.&quot;

From February 4 to February 27, 1861, the Peace Congress, featuring delegates from 21 of the 34 states, met at the Willard in a last-ditch attempt to avert the Civil War. A plaque from the Virginia Civil War Commission, located on the Pennsylvania Ave. side of the hotel, commemorates this courageous effort. Later that year, upon hearing a Union regiment singing &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; as they marched beneath her window, Julia Ward Howe wrote the lyrics to &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; while staying at the hotel in November 1861.

On February 23, 1861, amid several assassination threats, detective Allan Pinkerton smuggled Abraham Lincoln into the Willard; there Lincoln lived until his inauguration on March 4, holding meetings in the lobby and carrying on business from his room.

On March 27, 1874, the Northern and Southern Orders of Chi Phi met at the Willard to unite as the Chi Phi fraternity.

Many United States presidents have frequented the Willard, and every president since Franklin Pierce has either slept in or attended an event at the hotel at least once; the hotel hence is also known as &quot;the residence of presidents.&quot; Ulysses S. Grant first stayed there as a lieutenant in 1852. It was his habit to drink whiskey and smoke a cigar while relaxing in the lobby. Folklore (promoted by the hotel) holds that this is the origin of the term &quot;lobbying,&quot; as Grant was often approached by those seeking favors. However, this is probably false, as &quot;Webster&#x27;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary&quot; dates the verb &quot;to lobby&quot; to 1837. Grover Cleveland lived there at the beginning of his second term in 1893, because of concern for his infant daughter&#x27;s health following a recent outbreak of scarlet fever in the White House. Six sitting vice-presidents have lived in the Willard. Millard Fillmore and Thomas A. Hendricks, during his brief time in office, lived in the old Willard; and then four successive vice-presidents, James S. Sherman, Thomas R. Marshall, Calvin Coolidge and finally Charles Dawes all lived in the current building for at least part of their vice-presidency. Fillmore and Coolidge continued in the Willard, even after becoming president, to allow the first family time to move out of the White House.

The first recorded meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research was convened at the Willard on May 7, 1907.

Plans for Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s League of Nations took shape when he held meetings of the League to Enforce Peace in the hotel&#x27;s lobby in 1916.

A fire broke out in April 1922 while Calvin Coolidge was staying in the building. Attempting to re-enter the building, he was asked to identify himself to the fire marshal, to which he responded, &quot;I&#x27;m the Vice President.&quot; The fire marshal&#x27;s response was &quot;What are you vice president of?&quot;

Several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, first gathered with the General of the Armies, John J. &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing, at the Willard Hotel on October 2, 1922, and formally established the Reserve Officers Association (ROA) as an organization.

In 1935 the hotel was used as a place of confinement for William P. MacCracken Jr., Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics, after he was convicted of contempt of Congress in the Air Mail scandal. According to The Washington Post, &quot;Chesley Jurney, the Senate sargeant at arms, had no place to hold MacCracken who, after being sentenced, showed up at Jurney&#x27;s house and stayed the night. The next day he was confined to a room at the Willard Hotel.&quot;

During World War II the British government rented several of the Willard&#x27;s floors for its supply organization. Jean Monnet had his office there. In 1997 a memorial plaque was erected near the hotel&#x27;s entrance to commemorate this episode.

Martin Luther King Jr., wrote his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in his hotel room at the Willard in 1963, in the days leading up to his August 28 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
Among the Willard&#x27;s many other famous guests are P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, General Tom Thumb, Samuel Morse, the Duke of Windsor, Harry Houdini, Gypsy Rose Lee, Gloria Swanson, Emily Dickinson, Jenny Lind, Charles Dickens, Bert Bell, Joe Paterno, and Jim Sweeney.

Steven Spielberg shot the finale of his film &quot;Minority Report&quot; at the hotel in the summer of 2001. He filmed with Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow in the Willard Room, Peacock Alley and the kitchen. A replica of the terraced roof of the office building was constructed on a soundstage for the final scene.

On February 22, 2012, Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd gave a dramatic resignation speech in the hotel&#x27;s Douglas Room.

In the days leading up to the 2021 January 6 United States Capitol attack, a series of rooms and suites in the hotel functioned as an informal command center headed by Donald Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani for a White House plot to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The 12th president of South Korea, President Moon Jae-in stayed in the hotel during his 2021 visit.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed in the hotel during his 2023 visit.

==Rating==
The AAA gave the hotel four diamonds out of five in 1986. The hotel has maintained that rating every year, and received four diamonds again for 2016. Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as Mobil Guide) declined to give the hotel either four or five stars in 2016, but did add it to its list of &quot;recommended&quot; properties. In July 2024, Americas Great Resorts added the hotel to its Top Picks as a landmark property.

<text>FM Rail was a railway charter company based in Derby, England. The company was formed when spot hire company Fragonset Railways and charter operator Merlin Rail merged. It went into administration in 2006.

==History==
 
===Fragonset Railways===
Fragonset Railways was formed in 1997 as a spot hire company when four Class 47/7 locomotives were purchased from Waterman Railways with the operation initially based at the Tyseley Locomotive Works. In November 1997, Fragonset commenced its first contract providing locomotives for Virgin CrossCountry. A further Class 47/7 owned by the Lear family was also managed. A permanent base was established at the Railway Technical Centre, Derby. The locomotives were repainted into a new livery of black with a broad maroon mid-bodyside stripe.

In 1998, Fragonset purchased several redundant Class 31 locomotives from EWS. The first of these, 31452, was quickly repaired at the company&#x27;s base at Tyseley Locomotive Works. A further four Class 31s quickly followed. They were initially employed on Silverlink services on the Marston Vale Line, operating in top and tail mode with two carriages. The use of the Class 31s continued until 1999, when Class 150/1 diesel multiple units replaced them. Following this, the Class 31 fleet was employed on a variety of duties, including hire to WAGN to haul electrical multiple units between depots for maintenance.

Fragonset would go on to purchase many redundant locomotives from EWS, mainly of classes 31, 33, 47 and 73. By 2002 it had purchased 75.
First Great Western, Midland Mainline and Virgin CrossCountry all hired Class 47s. Wessex Trains hired Class 31s to haul passenger services from Bristol-Weymouth and Bristol-Brighton with 31601 repainted into Wessex Trains pink livery. First North Western hired Class 31s to work Blackpool-Manchester-Chester services.

Railtrack hired 31190 and 31601 to haul test trains. Both locomotives were repainted into Railtrack&#x27;s blue and lime green livery. Network Rail (Railtrack&#x27;s successor) purchased its own fleet of 31s, so no longer required the Fragonset locomotives. First GBRf hired Class 73s to supplement its own fleet.

South West Trains hired Class 33s and 73s to act as Thunderbird rescue locomotives. West Coast Railways hired 31190, repainted into &quot;Royal Scotsman&quot; maroon livery.

Some locomotives, notably 47355 and 73107, were repainted into a freight livery of all-over black with large Fragonset lettering.

===Merlin Rail===
Merlin received its train operating licence in July 2002. It was originally very decentralised, considering itself to be a &quot;virtual company&quot; operating over the internet with no central office, although the control office was initially in Maidstone, Kent. As the business grew the need for a central location became apparent and offices at Wyvern House, by Derby station, were rented from mid-2003.

Merlin saw itself as an operator of specialist, individually planned trains, and felt that such trains were not the core activity for conventional train operating companies and therefore did not always enjoy the best of operational and organisational arrangements. Merlin believed that a dedicated specialist train operator in this niche market could provide a high quality total service for all potential clients requiring individually planned trains.

Merlin was the first train operator to receive approval through the stringent Railway (Safety Case) Regulations, 2000, and held one of the widest railway safety cases, allowing full geographic coverage of the network with all classes and types of conventional locomotives, passenger rolling stock and loaded and unloaded freight vehicles. It was specifically authorised to operate new, unusual and novel vehicles.

===FM Rail===
In January 2005, Fragonset and Merlin merged to form FM Rail. In August 2005, the business of Hertfordshire Rail Tours was purchased.

FM Rail launched its new livery in September 2005, when 47832 was repainted for a Crewe Works open day.

In January 2006, the &quot;Blue Pullman&quot; was launched, and two Class 47 locomotives were repainted into a Nanking blue livery to match the coaching stock. In 2006, FM Rail purchased the assets of Pathfinder Tours, another railtour operator, in conjunction with Riviera Trains.

In February 2006, FM Rail operated its first freight service on behalf of Fastline between Doncaster and York.

In 2006, FM Rail concluded a deal to lease the former depot site at Coalville in Leicestershire. It was planned to move most of its withdrawn stock there to reduce costs. Other locomotives were disposed of once they had yielded spare parts.

==Administration==
In December 2006, Begbies Traynor was appointed as administrator of FM Rail.

The administrator sold the Fragonset Railways Maintenance business to Rail Vehicle Engineering Limited (RVEL), a company founded by former FM Rail managing director Andy Lynch; this business has since been sold to Loram and rebranded as Loram UK. The Merlin Rail train operating licence and railtour operator Hertfordshire Rail Tours was sold to Victa Westlink Rail, which later itself also went into administration, the majority of which was then absorbed by Stobart Rail.

The business affairs were not resolved until June 2013, when unsecured creditors received payments of 2p in the £.

<doc id="992282" wikidata="Q2614488" url="?curid=992282" title="Aero A.101">
<text>The Aero A.101 was a biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft built in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. 30 A.101s were built for the Czechoslovak Air Force in 1935–1936. The Spanish Civil War resulted in the surviving 28 aircraft being sold to the Spanish Republican forces in 1937, but a ship carrying some of the A.101s was captured by the Nationalists on the way to Spain, resulting in the type being used by both the Republican and Nationalist sides of the war. 65 more examples of a revised version, the Ab.101, were built for the Czechoslovakian Air Force from 1937, and served until the German invasion in March 1939.

==Design and development==
In 1933, the Czechoslovak Air Force had a requirement to replace ageing bombers such as the Letov Š-16 and Aero A.30, and so issued a requirement for an improved version of the Aero A.100. The new aircraft, the Aero A.101, was required to use Isotta Fraschini Asso 800 W18 engines that had been built under license by ČKD-Praga for the unsuccessful Aero A.42 monoplane bomber, instead of the license-built Hispano-Suiza 12N used by the A.100. Like the Aero A.100 upon which it was based, the A.101 was a single-engined biplane of mixed metal and wood construction, with a fixed conventional landing gear. The unequal-span single-bay wings had a wooden structure, with fabric covering over most of the wings while the leading edges were clad in plywood. The fuselage had a welded steel-tube structure. The A.101 had increased span wings and a lengthened fuselage compared to the A.100. While the Asso engine was more powerful (with a rating of compared to for the Hispano-Suiza engine), it was significantly heavier. 

The prototype was completed in November 1934, and made its first flight on 12 December 1934. An order for 29 production aircraft followed in January 1935. While testing was generally successful, the use of a heavy and obsolete engine was soon recognised as a mistake by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence, while changes to the aircraft&#x27;s specification during testing, including increasing the required bombload, and using larger tyres to increase standardisation, led to reductions in the aircraft&#x27;s performance, which was disappointing.

In March 1935, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence issued a requirement for a revised version of the A.101, the Aero Ab.101, to be powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs engine, which promised improved performance. An order for a prototype and 24 production aircraft was issued in September 1935. The Ab.101 was longer than the A.101, in order to maintain the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity with the lighter Hispano-Suiza engine, while maximum bombload increased to 1100 kg. The prototype Ab-101 made its first flight on 25 March 1936. Factory testing revealed a number of problems, particularly associated with the aircraft&#x27;s radiator and oil cooler. The prototype was finally accepted by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defense on 5 October 1936. While the performance of the new type was no better than the A-101, there were no better alternatives that were available within the required timescales, and a second order for 40 more Ab-101s was placed. These had only minor changes from the first series, with the pilot&#x27;s instruments being revised, with an artificial horizon and gyrocompass from the US company Sperry being fitted.

In 1937, Aero built as a private venture (i.e. without an official order), a further revised version, the Aero A.104, which kept the same fuselage as the Ab.101, but had the lower wing removed to make the aircraft a high wing monoplane, and an enclosed cockpit provided for the crew. Testing was not successful, and no production followed.

==Service history==
The A.101 entered service with the Czechoslovak Air Force from November 1935 to January 1936, with the 29 production aircraft and the prototype joining the 6th Air Regiment, equipping four squadrons (the 71st and 72nd Squadrons at Prague and the 73rd and 74th Squadrons at Hradec Králové). During 1936, two A.101s were destroyed in accidents, both as a result of engine failures, while the aircraft suffered from degradation of the plywood covering the wing leading edges, which required repair by Aero. Consideration was given to selling the A-101s to Romania, but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War meant that the Spanish Republican government urgently needed aircraft from whatever country was willing to sell them. 

On 23 January 1937, a contract was signed to sell the Spanish Republic all 28 remaining A-101s, together with 24 Letov Š-231 fighters and spare parts, using Estonia as an intermediary. The first batch of A-101s arrived at the port of Gdynia, Poland on 27 February 1937, but did not leave port aboard the Panamanian-flagged freighter &quot;Hordena&quot; until 8 April. The delay meant that the presence of the Aeros and their destination was well known in Gdynia before &quot;Hordena&quot; departed port, and a Nationalist agent warned that the freighter was carrying arms for the Republicans. The Nationalist cruiser was ordered to intercept the freighter, and &quot;Almirante Cervera&quot; captured &quot;Hordena&quot; in the Bay of Biscay on 16 April 1937, with the freighter taken into Ferrol. The captured aircraft entered service with the Spanish Nationalist Air Force, where they were known as &quot;Oca&quot; (Goose) or &quot;Praga&quot; (after the engine manufacturer). The Nationalist A.101s took part in the Battle of Brunete in July 1937, and continued to be heavily used until the end of the war, although they were obsolete, with nine A.101s lost due to enemy action or acctidents. None were lost to Republican fighters, with the A.101s usually operating away from areas where they would face significant fighter opposition, while they were usually given a fighter escort. After the end of the Civil War, the remaining Nationalist A.101s were used for observer training for the Spanish Air Force, but wear and tear and spares shortages led in them quickly being withdrawn from service, with none in service by October 1940. Delivery of the remaining A-101s that had not been captured on the &quot;Hardena&quot; was delayed by the Nationalist capture of Santander, with the aircraft shipped to the French port of Bassens, Gironde, and further by the closure of the border between France and Spain, so they did not cross the border until May 1938. Owing to the small number available and the type&#x27;s poor performance, they were not deployed at the front, but instead were used for coastal patrol over the Mediterranean. The last Republican A.101s were destroyed on the ground in air raids on 5 and 6 February 1939.

The first batch of Ab.101s were delivered from January to May 1937, with the second batch following from August 1937. Most of the Ab-101s went to the 5th Air Regiment, where they equipped three squadrons (the 75th 76th and 77th Squadrons). During the Munich crisis, the Ab.101 was the most numerous bomber in Czechoslovak service. The 5th Air Regiment&#x27;s Ab-101s were deployed to airfields in western Slovakia and southern Moravia to guard against a potential attack from Hungary, as they were not considered adequate to face the German Luftwaffe. During this deployment, the Ab.101 proved poorly suited to operations in the field, with most aircraft suffering deformation of wings and tails (and particularly leading edges) due to exposure to weather, adversely affecting the aircraft&#x27;s flying characteristics. It was planned to phase out the type following replacement by license-built B.71 bombers (the Czechoslovak designation for the Soviet Tupolev SB), but before this could happen, Germany occupied Bohemia and Moravia on 15 March 1939. The Germans seized 58 Ab.101s, while a single Ab.101 was in Slovakia when Slovakia seceded from Czechoslovakia on 14 March, and so came under the control of the Slovak Air Force. While at least one Ab-101 was painted in German markings, the Germans made little or no use of the captured Ab.101s. The sole Slovak Ab.101 defected to Poland on 4 June 1939, together with three Letov Š-328. It was captured by the Germans at Dęblin following the Invasion of Poland in September 1939.

<text>&quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot; is an English nursery rhyme, the earliest printed version of which dates from around 1744. The words have barely changed in two and a half centuries. It is sung to a variant of the 18th century French melody &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot;.

==Modern version==
&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; gives the following modern version:

The rhyme is a single stanza in trochaic metre, common in nursery rhymes and relatively easy for younger children. The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the song as 4439; variants have been collected across Great Britain and North America.

==Melody==

The rhyme is sung to a variant of the 18th century French melody &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot;, also used for &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;, &quot;Little Polly Flinders&quot;, and &quot;The ABC Song&quot;. The words and melody were first published together by A. H. Rosewig in &quot;(Illustrated National) Nursery Songs and Games&quot;, published in Philadelphia in 1879.
The text was translated to Swedish by August Strindberg for &quot;Barnen i skogen&quot; (1872), a Swedish edition of &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. To this Swedish text a melody was written by Alice Tegnér for publication in the songbook &quot;Sjung med oss, Mamma!&quot; (1892). &quot;Bä, bä, vita lamm&quot;, in which the black sheep is replaced with a white lamb, has become one of the most popular Swedish children&#x27;s songs.

==Origin and meaning==

The rhyme was first printed in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot; of about 1744, with words very similar to the modern version:

In the next surviving printing, in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; (c. 1765), the text remained the same, except the last lines, which were given as, &quot;But none for the little boy who cries in the lane&quot;.

As with many nursery rhymes, attempts have been made to find origins and meanings for the rhyme, most of which have no corroborating evidence. Katherine Elwes Thomas in &quot;The Real Personages of Mother Goose&quot; (1930) suggested the rhyme referred to resentment at the heavy taxation on wool. This has been taken to refer to the medieval English &quot;Great&quot; or &quot;Old Custom&quot; wool tax of 1275, which survived until the fifteenth century. More recently the rhyme has been alleged to have a connection to the slave trade, particularly in the southern United States. This explanation was advanced during debates over political correctness and the use and reform of nursery rhymes in the 1980s, but has no supporting historical evidence. Rather than being negative, the wool of black sheep may have been prized as it could be made into dark cloth without dyeing.

==Modern controversies==
In 1986 the British popular press reported a controversy over the rhyme&#x27;s language, suggesting that &quot;black&quot; was being treated as a racial term. This was based on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery as an exercise for the children there. A similar controversy emerged in 1999 when reservations about the rhyme were submitted to Birmingham City Council by a working group on racism in children&#x27;s resources. Two private nurseries in Oxfordshire in 2006 altered the song to &quot;Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep&quot;, with &quot;black&quot; being replaced with a variety of other adjectives such as &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;hopping&quot; and &quot;pink&quot;. Commentators have asserted that these controversies have been exaggerated or distorted by some elements of the press as part of a general campaign against political correctness.

In 2014, there was reportedly a similar controversy in the Australian state of Victoria.

==Allusions==
The phrase &quot;yes sir, yes sir, three bags full sir&quot; has been used in reference to an obsequious or craven subordinate. It is attested from 1910, and originally was common in the British Royal Navy.

The rhyme has often appeared in literature and popular culture. Rudyard Kipling used it as the title of an 1888 semi-autobiographical short story. The name Black Sheep Squadron was used for the Marine Attack Squadron 214 of the United States Marine Corps from 1942 and the title &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; was used for a book by its leader Colonel Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington and for a TV series (later syndicated as &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot;) that aired on NBC from 1976 until 1978. In 1951, together with &quot;In the Mood&quot;, &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; was the first song ever to be digitally saved and played on a computer.

<text>Daryn A. Kagan (born January 26, 1963) is an American broadcast journalist, formerly a news anchor for CNN.

From 1994 to 2006, Kagan served as an anchor and correspondent for CNN, in CNN&#x27;s corporate headquarters of Atlanta, Georgia. She anchored &quot;CNN Live Today&quot; shown from 10am-12pm Eastern Time for eight years. She also served as host of the CNN/&quot;People&quot; news entertainment program, &quot;People in the News&quot;, and earlier served as a CNN sports reporter and anchor.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kagan grew up in a secular Jewish family in Beverly Hills, California. She is a 1981 graduate of Beverly Hills High School where she ran cross-country, and a 1985 graduate of Stanford University.

===Career===
After graduating from Stanford, Kagan sent out hundreds of demo tapes. She was hired for an on-air job at a Santa Barbara television station, KEYT-TV. From there, she moved to a general assignment reporting position at KTVK, which is based in Phoenix, where she went on to take the additional role of weekend sports anchor in addition to her weekday reporting duties.

After KTVK did not renew Kagan&#x27;s contract, Jim Walton, the head of CNN/SI, hired Kagan as sports anchor and correspondent. She went on to cover major sporting events including the Super Bowl, the NBA Playoffs, and international figure skating championships from Russia. Kagan later moved to CNN&#x27;s news division and became a main CNN news anchor and correspondent.

In this role, Kagan reported on presidential and mid-term elections. She reported on-site from the Middle East during the second Gulf War and the Washington, D.C. sniper attack investigation. Kagan traveled to Africa with musician Bono where she reported on AIDS and famine for all of the CNN networks. While in Africa, Kagan maintained a daily blog on CNN.com of her reports and experiences. Additionally, she reported several Academy Awards ceremonies and the Monterey Jazz Festival.

Kagan is one of a handful of national news anchors who was on the air live during the terrorist attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001. She reported throughout the day and, in later days, covered the unfolding story from CNN headquarters in Atlanta and from the network&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau.

After CNN declined to renew her employment contract, Kagan left CNN on September 1, 2006, to launch a personal news website, DarynKagan.com, on November 13, 2006. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described Kagan&#x27;s site as having &quot;buck[ed] the media tide with an emphasis on stories that illustrate the triumph of the human spirit.&quot; In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kagan discussed her career, and said &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important to be informed. I just also think it&#x27;s important to be inspired.&quot;

Kagan went on to extend her DarynKagan.com brand of content to television news documentaries, radio, and books. Her first TV film, &quot;Breaking the Curse&quot;, aired on PBS and won the 2008 Gracie Award for Outstanding Documentary. Kagan produced and narrated the film, which told the story of an American woman fighting for those living with leprosy in India. Kagan&#x27;s first book, &quot;What&#x27;s Possible!&quot;, was released in 2008 by Meredith Books, and was described by the Associated Press as &quot;stories about people who overcame obstacles to achieve dreams.&quot; Her next documentary, &quot;Solartown USA,&quot; was about a Wisconsin town that made a commitment to solar power in the 1970s. Oprah Radio began to run DarynKagan.com content each day beginning in March 2009 on SIRIUS XM radio.

===Personal life===
Kagan sees her story as one of &quot;reinvention,&quot; and speaks around the country on that topic. She is Jewish, and her great-grandfather was a Russian immigrant named Eiser Cohen who came to the United States through Ellis Island and settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her grandfather, Jack Kagan, later moved to the Los Angeles area. Her mother, Phyllis Kagan, is a breast cancer survivor who has appeared on CNN discussing the disease. Kagan has a younger sister named Kallan, an executive at Arc Productions, and an older brother named Mark.

In September 2004, Kagan became romantically involved with radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, but they broke up in February 2006. Kagan is married to Trent Swanson and is stepmother to his two daughters. The marriage took place sometime before 2015.

Kagan has adopted a three-legged cat, Tripod, and a dog, Darla Louise, from rescue shelters.

<doc id="992298" wikidata="Q3398694" url="?curid=992298" title="Riders of the Purple Sage">
<text>Riders of the Purple Sage is a Western novel by Zane Grey, first published by Harper &amp; Brothers in 1912. Considered by scholars to have played a significant role in shaping the formula of the popular Western genre, the novel has been called &quot;the most popular western novel of all time&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; is a story about three main characters, Bern Venters, Jane Withersteen, and Jim Lassiter, who in various ways struggle with persecution from the local Mormon community led by Bishop Dyer and Elder Tull in the fictional town of Cottonwoods, Utah, around 1870-71.

Jane Withersteen, a born-and-raised Mormon, provokes Elder Tull because she is attractive, wealthy (and single), and befriends &quot;Gentiles&quot; (non-Mormons), namely, a little girl named Fay Larkin, a man she has hired named Bern Venters, and another hired man named Jim Lassiter. Elder Tull, a polygamist with two wives already, wishes to have Jane for a third wife, along with her estate.

The story involves cattle-rustling, horse-theft, kidnapping and gunfights.

== Setting ==

The setting is Southern Utah canyon country, 1871. The influx of Mormon settlers from 1847 to 1857 serves as a backdrop for the plot. The Mormons had been living in Kirtland, Ohio, in the 1830s, but ventured west to escape local religious persecution.

== Point of view ==
The story is told by an omniscient narrator reporting the characters&#x27; actions and thoughts, for example: &quot;On this night the same old loneliness beset Venters...&quot;

==Characters==
;Jane Withersteen
Wealthy owner and operator of the sizable Withersteen ranch founded by her father. She is single, having resisted the efforts of others to push her into a plural marriage. Miss Withersteen sympathizes with both Mormons (her own people) and Gentiles, which gets her into trouble with the local bishop and elder.

;Bern Venters
Venters is a non-Mormon employed by Miss Withersteen. As the story opens he is in a very poor state, being persecuted by the local Mormons. He is very able with firearms and horses, and is determined to survive and prosper.

;Jim Lassiter
Lassiter is a gunfighter on a mysterious mission which brings him to Cottonwoods and Miss Withersteen. He is a non-Mormon and has no creed except his own pride.

;Bess/Elizabeth Erne
Bess, known as the Masked Rider, has been raised by the outlaw Oldring and his band of rustlers; she has very little memory of her mother. 

;Elder Tull
Tull practices &quot;plural marriage&quot; and desires to marry Jane Withersteen. He also tries to drive Bern Venters and Lassiter out of town and out of the region.

==Sequel==
&quot;The Rainbow Trail&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; that reveals the fate of Jane and Lassiter and their adopted daughter, was published in 1915. Both novels are notable for their protagonists&#x27; strong opposition to Mormon polygamy, but in &quot;Rainbow Trail&quot; this theme is treated more explicitly. Both plots revolve around the victimization of women in the Mormon culture: &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; centers on the struggle of a Mormon woman who sacrifices her wealth and social status to avoid becoming a junior wife of the head of the local church, while &quot;Rainbow Trail&quot; contrasts the fanatical older Mormons with the rising generation of Mormon women who will not tolerate polygamy and Mormon men who do not seek it.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
&quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; has been adapted to film five times.
* &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1918), starring William Farnum and Mary Mersch (silent)
* &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1925), starring Tom Mix and Mabel Ballin (silent)
* &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1931), starring George O&#x27;Brien and Marguerite Churchill (sound)
* &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1941), starring George Montgomery and Mary Howard
* &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1996), starring Ed Harris and Amy Madigan (television film)

===Other media===
During World War II the novel was rejected for publication as an Armed Services Editions paperback provided to US servicemen due to perceived bias against Mormonism.

In 1952, Dell released a comic book version of the novel (Dell # 372).

&quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; was adapted into an opera by composer Craig Bohmler and librettist Steven Mark Kohn. It had its world premiere in February and March 2017 by the Arizona Opera in Tucson and Phoenix. The opera was broadcast nationwide on November 25, 2017, on the WFMT Radio Network&#x27;s American Opera Series, and broadcast internationally in 2018 via distribution to the European Broadcasting Union.

<text>American Morning is an American three-hour morning television news program that aired on CNN from 2001 to 2011. &quot;American Morning&quot; debuted with anchors Paula Zahn and Anderson Cooper on the day after the September 11 attacks, five months earlier than planned, replacing &quot;CNN Early Edition&quot; and &quot;CNN Live This Morning&quot;.

Cooper was replaced by Bill Hemmer in February 2002. The show&#x27;s next permanent co-anchors were Soledad O&#x27;Brien and Miles O&#x27;Brien, who fronted the show from 2003 to 2007. They were replaced by John Roberts and Kiran Chetry due to poor ratings. After Roberts and Chetry left in 2011, the show did not have a permanent anchor team and was shelved by CNN at the end of the year. &quot;American Morning&quot; was replaced by two new programs, &quot;Early Start&quot; and &quot;Starting Point&quot;.

==About the show==
&quot;American Morning&quot; was last hosted by Ali Velshi, Christine Romans and Carol Costello. Others who appeared regularly were Rob Marciano with the weather, Sunny Hostin on legal news, and CNN senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta as well as Elizabeth Cohen with health-related reports.

&quot;American Morning&quot; maintained a stronger focus on political, domestic and global stories than many U.S. morning shows, as demonstrated by its slogan &quot;the most news in the morning,&quot; although it did have segments related to celebrities and entertainment news. There are usually more scripted segments on &quot;American Morning&quot; than on other morning shows. The program mainly aimed to attract viewers who prefer a more straightforward morning show, without the amount of anchor banter found on the competition. Its main competitors were Fox News&#x27; &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot;.

&quot;American Morning&quot; aired live every weekday from 6 to 9 am EST. After years of operating from a streetside studio at the 1271 Avenue of the Americas in New York City, the show moved north to an indoor set at the CNN studios in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle which was shared with the HLN show &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;. In October 2006, AM received a redesigned set, along with new music and graphics.

On September 26, 2007, &quot;American Morning&quot; began broadcasting in high-definition television.

Originally AM aired from 7am to 10am. After the cancellation of &quot;CNN Daybreak&quot; in November 2005, the program was expanded to four hours, 6am to 10am. However, the air time was reduced in October 2006 to 6am to 9am, after the expansion of &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot;.

==History==

===2001–2009===
&quot;American Morning&quot; originally premiered on September 12, 2001. Paula Zahn began anchoring the program five months early due to the 9/11 attacks which had occurred the previous morning. Jack Cafferty and Anderson Cooper joined her as co-hosts and helped deliver news on the attacks.

In February 2002, Bill Hemmer moved to New York to become Paula Zahn&#x27;s co-host, replacing Anderson Cooper. In April 2003, Bill Hemmer anchored the program solo when Paula Zahn moved to CNN primetime. Heidi Collins and Daryn Kagan temporarily hosted with Bill Hemmer before Soledad O&#x27;Brien debuted as co-host.

In January 2002, CNN executives were embarrassed to find out an on-air promotion that was not approved by top executives was being aired that called Paula Zahn &quot;sexy&quot; and included the sound of a zipper. CNN said that the advertisement was approved by a woman in the productions department. CNN later apologized to Paula Zahn.

In June 2005, Bill Hemmer left CNN and was replaced by Miles O&#x27;Brien. Heidi Collins was replaced by Carol Costello. Jack Cafferty left the show later that summer. The show moved to the Time Warner Center, and shared a set with the CNN Headline News program &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;. Costello later left the program and was not replaced; she returned in 2011. In October 2006, the show received a redesigned set, along with new music and graphics.

Due to disappointing Nielsen ratings, CNN announced the replacement of Miles O&#x27;Brien and Soledad O&#x27;Brien with Kiran Chetry and John Roberts as program hosts effective April 16, 2007. In the first quarter of 2007, &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; on Fox News Channel averaged 769,000 viewers, CNN&#x27;s &quot;American Morning&quot; averaged 372,000 and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; averaged 361,000 viewers at the time of its cancellation by MSNBC on April 11, 2007.

===2010–2011===
On November 22, 2010, &quot;American Morning&quot; underwent a lighter graphics change.

2011 saw the departures of Roberts and Chetry. Ali Velshi initially filled in alongside Chetry before the latter&#x27;s departure in July. Chetry was replaced by Christine Romans and Carol Costello.

In October 2011, CNN announced a revamp of its morning lineup to be more competitive against cable entries &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Fox News and &quot;Morning Joe&quot; on MSNBC. &quot;American Morning&quot; would be replaced by two new programs from January 2, 2012, &quot;Early Start&quot; (5-7 a.m.) and &quot;Starting Point&quot; (7-9 a.m.) (both times ET). The shows are expected to be less politically focused and cover a broad range of news.

The final broadcast of &quot;American Morning&quot; on December 30, 2011 was anchored by Alina Cho and Deborah Feyerick. Cho and Feyerick brought show staff onto the set, thanking them for their efforts.

<text>Bob Larson (born May 28, 1944) is an American radio and television evangelist, and a pastor of Spiritual Freedom Church in Phoenix, Arizona. Larson has authored numerous books critical of rock music and Satanism.

==Life and career==
Larson was born in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, the son of Viola (née Baum) and Earl Larson. He was raised in McCook, Nebraska.

Larson plays guitar; he has claimed his early experiences as a musician led to his concerns about occult and destructive influences in rock music. He would later incorporate his guitar playing into some of his sermons. In the 1960s, the focus of Larson&#x27;s preaching centered mainly on the leftist political ideology, sexually suggestive lyrics, Eastern religious mysticism, and anti-social behavior of many of the era&#x27;s rock musicians.

===Debates with Satanists===
During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Larson repeatedly debated, interviewed, and confronted Satanists, during the period known as the Satanic panic. On two occasions he hosted Nikolas Schreck (a gothic rock musician and lead singer of Radio Werewolf) and Zeena LaVey (once the spokesperson for the Church of Satan and later a priestess in the Temple of Set). During their first encounter the pair defended Satanism, while in 1997, during their second appearance, they defended Setianism. Larson debated the pair, and at times attempted to convert them without success. 

=== &quot;Talk Back&quot; ===
In 1982, Larson launched &quot;Talk Back&quot;, a two-hour weekday call-in show geared mainly toward teenagers and frequently focused on teen-oriented topics such as role-playing games and rock music. By this time Larson had come to embrace contemporary Christian music, including styles such as heavy metal and rap, and actively promoted the music and artists on his show.

By the late 1980s, in what would come to define his later ministry, Larson was often heard performing exorcisms of callers on the air. The subjects of Satanism and Satanic ritual abuse were frequent topics of discussion. Death metal performer Glen Benton of Deicide became a regular caller, as did Bob Guccione Jr., eldest son of &quot;Penthouse&quot; founder Bob Guccione and founder of the music magazine &quot;Spin&quot;. At one point during the 1980s, Guccione Jr. paid Larson to go on tour with American thrash metal band Slayer and write about it.

Deicide frontman Glen Benton said of Larson: 

===Written works===
Larson tried his hand at writing fiction. &quot;Dead Air&quot; (1991) was largely ghost-written by Lori Boespflug and Muriel Olson, according to Karen Stollznow. His later novels &quot;Abaddon&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Senator&#x27;s Agenda&quot; (1995) both linked Satanic ritual abuse to political corruption; the latter was largely written by Larson and his second wife. However, a former vice president of Bob Larson Ministries, Lori Boespflug, said that much of &quot;Dead Air&quot;, though presented as Larson&#x27;s work, is allegedly her own. Supporting these claims is a letter from Larson&#x27;s lawyer that warns Larson of his &quot;potential liability to Lori&quot;, anticipating that &quot;the role Lori has played&quot; would lead her to &quot;demand recognition and/or profit participation&quot; in respect to &quot;Dead Air&quot; and its sequels.

==Exorcism==
In 2013 &quot;Vice&quot; magazine taped a video of Larson&#x27;s visit in several small towns in Ukraine where he performed exorcisms together with three young women – his 18-year-old daughter Brynne Larson and her friends Tess and Savannah Sherkenback (18 and 21 respectively, collectively known as &quot;The Teenage Exorcists&quot;). The Teenage Exorcists consequently published a reply to Vice Media&#x27;s video stating that they &quot;question the journalistic integrity of this Vice Media story and are disappointed by how we were falsely portrayed.&quot;

, Larson offered to perform exorcisms over Skype (for a donation of $295). His Skype exorcisms were featured in a segment on the satirical program &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in 2014, in which he told correspondent Jessica Williams, &quot;Skype is a great technology to stare down the Devil, to go after him and to kick him back to hell.&quot; Later in the same segment, however, he indicated that &quot;tweeting an exorcism would be ridiculous.&quot;

<text>In baseball, batting is the act of facing the opposing pitcher and trying to produce offense for one&#x27;s team. A batter or hitter is a person whose turn it is to face the pitcher. The three main goals of batters are to become a baserunner, to drive runners home or to advance runners along the bases for others to drive home, but the techniques and strategies they use to do so vary. Hitting uses a motion which is virtually unique to baseball and its fellow bat-and-ball sports, one that is rarely used in other sports. Hitting is unique because it involves rotating in the horizontal plane of movement, unlike most sports movements which occur in the vertical plane.

==Goals==
In general, batters try to get hits. However, their primary objective is to avoid making an out, and helping their team score runs. There are several ways they can help their team score runs. They may draw a walk if they receive and do not swing the bat at four pitches located outside the strike zone. In cases when there is a runner on third and fewer than two outs, they can attempt to hit a sacrifice fly to drive the runner in by allowing the runner on third to tag up and score. When there are fewer than two outs and runners on base, they can try to sacrifice bunt to advance the runner(s) or, with a runner on first or with runners on first and third, they can try a hit and run play, also designed to advance the runner(s). They might even be hit by a pitch, reach on an error or—if first is empty or there are two outs—on a dropped third strike.

The defense attempts to get the batter out. The pitcher&#x27;s main role in this is to throw the ball in such a way that the batter either strikes out or cannot hit it cleanly so the defense can get him out.

==Success in batting==
Batting is often cited as one of the most difficult feats in sports because it consists of hitting a small round ball, usually moving at high velocity, with a thin round bat. Batters getting a hit in three out of ten at bats, giving him a batting average of .300 (pronounced &quot;three hundred&quot;) are considered a successful hitter. In Major League Baseball, no batter has had over a .400 average at the end of the season since Ted Williams&#x27; .406 in 1941, and no batter has ever hit over .367 in a lifetime—Ty Cobb hit .3664. In modern times, the statistic on-base plus slugging (OPS) is seen as a more accurate measure of a player&#x27;s ability as a batter; this stat combines the player&#x27;s on-base percentage (a percentage of their plate appearances where the batter gets on base), with the player&#x27;s slugging percentage (an average of total bases with at-bats). An OPS at or near 1.000 is considered to be the mark of an exceptional hitter. A sustained OPS at or above 1.000 over a career is a feat only a few hitters have ever been able to reach.

==Strategy==
Batters vary in their approach at the plate. Some are aggressive hitters, usually swinging at the first pitch (as pitchers often attempt to throw a first-pitch strike).
Others are patient, attempting to work the pitch count in order to observe all the types of pitches a pitcher will use, as well as tire out the pitcher by forcing him to throw many pitches early. Generally, contact hitters are more aggressive, swinging at pitches within the strike zone, whereas power hitters will lay off borderline strikes in order to get a pitch they can drive for extra bases.

==Warming up==
In preparation of hitting, every baseball player has their own particular warm-up routine. Warming up before the game is usually done as a team, at the amateur level, and focuses on helping the hitter get in the correct mindset to hit the ball. The most notable drill used is the &quot;Tee Drill&quot;, where batters hit a ball off a baseball tee and correct any issues they found during previous games or practices. There are also various hitting devices used during warm-up in the &quot;on deck circle&quot; to try and increase the batter&#x27;s bat velocity. The over weighted supplemental devices include swinging multiple bats, standard 23 oz softball bat, heavier 26 oz softball bat, lighter 18 oz softball bat and doughnut ring (16 oz). Weighted warm-up devices are commonly used because players feel that warming-up with heavier bats will help them increase bat velocity. After the warm-up with a heavier bat, the normal bat seems lighter and players feel they can swing it faster. The effect of these devices is not only mental, but it may also be physical. Heavy warm-up loads stimulate the neural system, allowing for increased muscle activation during lighter bat swings. The use of weighted bats is based on the theory of complex training where sets of heavier and lighter resistances are alternated to increase muscle performance. This theory revolves around the idea that muscle contractions are stronger after reaching near maximal contractions. The postactivation potentiation improves motor neuron pool excitability and increases the number of recruited motor units, both leading to greater power output. The additional weight may also help strengthen the muscles of the forearms and wrist thus increasing bat velocity, though some evidence suggests that the effect is psychological rather than biomechanical.

==The lineup==
The lineup or batting order is a list of the nine baseball players for a team in the order they will bat. During the game, the only way to change the lineup is via substitution, as batting out of turn is not allowed. Once the ninth person in the lineup finishes batting, the first person bats again; this is the &quot;top of the order&quot;. Lineups are designed to facilitate manufacturing runs. Depending on batters&#x27; skills, they might be placed in different parts of the lineup. Of course, when it comes down to it, all batters are attempting to create runs for the team.

The player currently batting in a game is said to be &quot;at the plate&quot;, &quot;at bat&quot;, or &quot;up to bat&quot; (shortened to &quot;up&quot;). To keep the game moving at an orderly pace, the next batter due up waits to take his turn in a circle (actually marked or imaginary) between his team&#x27;s &quot;dugout&quot; or bench and the batter&#x27;s box, and is said to be &quot;on deck&quot;, with the circle known as the &quot;on deck circle&quot;. The player in the batting order after the on deck batter is said to be &quot;in the hole&quot;.

==Types of hitters==
* Power hitters: power hitters, or sluggers, are batters who drive the ball, usually hitting home runs and other extra-base hits, but tend to strike out more often than contact hitters. See also slugging percentage.
* Pull hitters: batters who tend to hit the ball to the same side of the field as the side of the plate they are standing on.
* Opposite field hitting Hitters: batters who are able to delay their swing by a fraction of a second so as to drive the ball in the side of the field opposite from the side of the plate they are standing on. Opposite field hitting does not come naturally to most batters, and not many players have the bat control necessary for opposite field hitting. Derek Jeter is well known for his ability as an opposite field hitter.
* Contact hitters: batters who do not strike out often and are able to frequently put the ball in play. They tend to hit fewer home runs than power hitters. Luis Arraez is known for his extremely high contact rate, resulting in few strikeouts, home runs, or walks.
* Slap hitters: slap hitters are batters who rarely try to drive the ball. Instead these hitters simply attempt to &quot;slap&quot; the ball through the infielders to reach base.
* Complete hitters: players who can not only slap the ball, but can come up with extra base hits.
* Designated hitters: used as a batting substitute for the pitcher. The designated hitter role was adopted by the American League in 1973, and was only in effect in AL ballparks. As of 2022, the rule also applies to National League teams.
* Switch hitters: capable of batting left or right-handed
* Pinch hitters: a substitute hitter for the scheduled batter in the lineup. A DH acts as a permanent pinch hitter for the pitcher. Once a pinch hitter bats, he will replace the previous batter in the lineup unless a substitution is made. Prior to the onset of the universal DH, NL teams occasionally used pinch hitters in place of pitchers when not playing in an AL ballpark; commonly this involves a double switch.

==History of the bat==
When baseball was in its beginning years, players made their own bats. This allowed players to experiment with different shapes and sizes of the bats. It did not take long for players to realize that the best bats were those with rounded barrels. Wooden bats are rare at most levels other than the pros. The majority of wooden baseball bats today are made from northern white ash harvested from Pennsylvania or New York. White ash is used because of its hardness, durability, strength, weight and feel. Trees that provide the lumber for baseball bats are often 50 years old, and of all the lumber harvested, the top 10 percent is saved for pro bats. Recent technology in drying wood has created bats with lower moisture content, which are light enough to make effective baseball bats. Rock or Sugar Maple bats are preferred. Maple bats cost more than white ash, but they often last longer as a result of their high strength.

==Types of bats==
In addition to the Louisville Slugger, there are many other types of bats that have been used throughout the history of baseball.
The introduction of aluminum baseball bats in the 1970s forever changed the game of baseball at every level but the professional. Aluminum bats are lighter and stronger than wooden bats. Due to the trampoline effect that occurs when a baseball hits an aluminum bat, they can hit a ball significantly further than wooden bats can.

In light of the increase in power of composite and alloy bats, the NCAA and NFHS have adopted more stringent standards against the use of composite and alloy bats. The NCAA changed standards at the start of the 2011 season, and the NFHS plans to complete the change in the 2012 baseball season.

==Bat design==
The design of bats also continues to evolve as manufacturers search for ways to magnify the trampoline effect and increase the size of the bat&#x27;s “sweet spot.” In aluminum bats, a double-walled bat was introduced in the late 1990s. This design comprises an outer wall of scandium-aluminum, an inner wall of a composite material, and a “filling of rubber or a thick fluid between the two walls.

<text>Action is an American dark comedy series about a Hollywood producer named Peter Dragon, who is trying to recover from his last box-office failure. It aired on Fox from September 16 to December 2, 1999. The series was critically praised for its irreverent and sometimes hostile look at Hollywood culture. Thirteen episodes were produced. The show was created by Chris Thompson and the show runner was Don Reo. Future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Will Forte was the story editor for twelve episodes, and wrote three.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Peter Dragon, played by Jay Mohr, is the head of Dragonfire Films. Peter got his start as a screenwriter for gay pornography, but eventually moved up the ladder of Hollywood as a hotshot producer of tasteless action films. Under tremendous pressure to make his next film a big success, Peter is bossy, arrogant, and unscrupulous.
* Wendy Ward, played by Illeana Douglas, is a former child actress as the cute star of the TV show, &quot;The Elephant Princess&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;The Elephant Princess&quot;). She had been a teen cocaine addict, and is now a high priced hooker with a heart of gold. Peter names her Vice President of Production at Dragonfire Films and has a romantic open relationship. Douglas later called this role &quot;the greatest part offered to me in my career&quot;.
* Lonnie Dragon, played by Buddy Hackett, is Peter&#x27;s uncle and chief of security at Dragonfire Films. Lonnie and Peter seem to understand each other perfectly.
* Stuart Glazer, played by Jack Plotnick, is President of Production at Dragonfire Films. Stuart desperately wants to be taken seriously as a Hollywood developer, but is frequently abused and ordered around by Peter. In spite of his important sounding position, Stuart is often asked to do demeaning tasks like babysit, have suits dry-cleaned, and order gift baskets for star talent.
* Adam Rafkin, played by Jarrad Paul, is a Jewish struggling screenwriter whose screenplay, &quot;Beverly Hills Gun Club&quot;, was picked up by Dragonfire Films for development. Adam&#x27;s script was actually bought mistakenly by Dragonfire Films because his name was confused with the much better known writer Adam Rifkin.

=== Supporting ===
* Asher, played by John Vargas, is the Eurotrash maître d&#x27; that runs the high-end restaurant where every power player in town lunches. Getting the right table is vital, and Asher wields his power with the same aplomb as Peter does. Watching Peter squirm is one of Asher&#x27;s delights.
* Bobby Gianopolis, played by Lee Arenberg, is the chief executive of the unnamed movie studio. He uses menacing threats to get what he wants from Dragonfire, such as withdrawing his massive financial backing or exposing his gigantic penis. He is homosexual, but married Jane, Peter&#x27;s ex-wife, to quell any rumors of such. Many critics have suggested that Bobby is a parody of former FOX CEO Barry Diller.
* Jane Dragon, played by Cindy Ambuehl, is Peter&#x27;s ex-wife. She married Bobby Gianopolis mostly to spite Peter. She is manipulative, scheming, and is so orally gifted she can hum and whistle at the same time. She has a daughter by Peter named Georgia and was pregnant with his second child, unknown to him.
* Georgia Dragon, played by Sara Paxton, is Peter&#x27;s daughter by Jane. 11–12 years old, she is deceptively innocent but mildly stone-hearted for her age, a trait she gets from her parents.
* Jenny, played by Erin Daniels, is a struggling Hollywood career woman. She used to work at UPN, but after having sex with Peter, moved on to become a production assistant at Dragonfire Films, where she then had sex with Wendy. She is in competition with Stuart.
* Cole Riccardi, played by Richard Burgi, is a famous action star who has been in many of Peter&#x27;s movies. He is introspective, self-obsessed and secretly gay.
* Connie Hunt, played by Amy Aquino, is the aggressive publicist assigned to Peter Dragon by Bobby Gianapolis after a major public relations disaster. She is dry, practical, and cold-hearted.
* Titus Scroad, played by R. Lee Ermey, is an eccentric American movie director loosely parodying real-life Italian director Tinto Brass (albeit lightly crossed with Terrence Malick).] He has a predilection for hydro-colonic therapy and tends to accentuate his bravado by grabbing his listener&#x27;s testicles.
* Holden van Dorn, played by Fab Filippo, is a hotshot young actor, with a very public record of alcohol and drug abuse.
* Reagan Lauren Busch, played by Jennifer Lyons, is a sexy starlet with an anxious appetite and recurrent weight problems.

&quot;Action&quot; also frequently used celebrities playing themselves in cameo appearance, including Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Salma Hayek, and David Hasselhoff.

==Theme song==
The song in the opening credits, &quot;Even A Dog Can Shake Hands&quot;, was performed by Warren Zevon from his album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;.

== Episodes ==
==Reception==
Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;the show is truly subversive and daring in its scabrous attitude&quot;. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;the most daring and outrageous new comedy of the season&quot;, and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called it &quot;a dead-on satire of lost souls in the entertainment biz, with enough boldness to qualify for cable viewing&quot;. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series a grade of B, saying, &quot;&quot;Action&quot; shreds Hollywood corporate culture more viciously than current big-screen spoofs like &quot;Bowfinger&quot; and &quot;The Muse&quot;. The difference is, &quot;Action&quot;″s acid heartlessness renders it a more artful but ultimately less likable piece of work.&quot;

David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; found the series insulting and the pilot episode in particular to be culturally insensitive. He wondered whether audiences are supposed to identify with or despise Peter Dragon.

==Broadcast and syndication==
Fox canceled it due to ratings. Of the 13 produced episodes, only 8 ran on Fox in 1999. The remaining five episodes were eventually broadcast on other networks such as FX and Comedy Central. This is the first Fox series to receive a TV-MA rating.

The show reran on IFC from 2012 to 2013.

== Home media ==
On February 21, 2006, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various series from the Sony Pictures Television library including &quot;Action&quot;. The complete series was subsequently re-released on April 1, 2014.

As of March 2009, the show can be purchased on iTunes.

<text>Fannie Lou Hamer (; Townsend; October 6, 1917 – March 14, 1977) was an American voting and women&#x27;s rights activist, community organizer, and leader of the civil rights movement. She was the vice-chair of the Freedom Democratic Party, which she represented at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Hamer also organized Mississippi&#x27;s Freedom Summer along with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She was also a co-founder of the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus, an organization created to recruit, train, and support women of all races who sought election to government offices.

Hamer began her civil rights activism in 1962, continuing it until her health declined nine years later. She was known for her use of spiritual hymns and quotes and her resilience in leading the civil rights movement for black women in Mississippi. She was extorted, threatened, harassed, shot at, and assaulted by racists, including members of the police, while she was trying to register to vote. She later helped and encouraged thousands of African Americans in Mississippi to become registered voters and helped hundreds of disenfranchised people in her area through her work in programs such as the Freedom Farm Cooperative. She ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964, losing to John C. Stennis, and the Mississippi State Senate in 1971. In 1970, she led legal action against the government of Sunflower County, Mississippi, for continued illegal segregation.

Hamer died on March 14, 1977, aged 59, in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Her memorial service was widely attended and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young delivered the eulogy. She was posthumously inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1993. On January 4, 2025, President Joe Biden awarded Hamer the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.

==Early life, family, and education==
Hamer was born as Fannie Lou Townsend on October 6, 1917, in Montgomery County, Mississippi. She was the last of the 20 children of Lou Ella and James Lee Townsend.

In 1919, the Townsends moved to Ruleville, Mississippi, to work as sharecroppers on W. D. Marlow&#x27;s plantation. From age six, Hamer picked cotton with her family. During the winters of 1924 through 1930, she attended the one-room school provided for the sharecroppers&#x27; children, open between picking seasons. Hamer loved reading and excelled in spelling bees and reciting poetry, but at age 12 she had to leave school to help support her aging parents. By age 13, she would pick 200–300 pounds (90 to 140 kg) of cotton daily while living with polio.

Hamer continued to develop her reading and interpretation skills in Bible study at her church; in later years Lawrence Guyot admired her ability to connect &quot;the biblical exhortations for liberation and [the struggle for civil rights] any time that she wanted to and move in and out to any frames of reference&quot;. In 1944, after the plantation owner discovered her literacy, she was selected as its time and record keeper. The following year she married Perry &quot;Pap&quot; Hamer, a tractor driver on the Marlow plantation, and they remained there for the next 18 years.

Hamer and her husband wanted very much to start a family but in 1961, a white doctor subjected Hamer to a hysterectomy without her consent while she was undergoing surgery to remove a uterine tumor. Forced sterilization was a common method of population control in Mississippi that targeted poor, African-American women. Members of the Black community called the procedure a &quot;Mississippi appendectomy&quot;. The Hamers later raised two girls they adopted, eventually adopting two more. One, Dorothy Jean, died at age 22 of internal hemorrhaging after she was denied admission to the local hospital because of her mother&#x27;s activism.

Hamer became interested in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. She heard leaders of the local movement speak at annual Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL) conferences, held in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. The attendees of the yearly conferences discussed black voting rights and other civil rights issues black communities in the area faced. She became a good friend of RCNL founder and head T. R. M. Howard.

==Civil rights activism==

===Registering to vote===

On August 31, 1962, Hamer and 17 others attempted to vote but failed a literacy test, which meant that they could not vote. On December 4, just after she returned to her hometown, Hamer went to the courthouse in Indianola, where she took the test again, but she failed it again and she was turned away as a result. She told the registrar, &quot;You&#x27;ll see me every 30 days till I pass&quot;. On January 10, 1963, she took the test a third time. She was successful and was informed that she was now a registered voter in Mississippi. But when she attempted to vote that fall, she discovered her registration did not allow her to vote, as her county also required voters to have two poll tax receipts. 

This requirement had emerged in some (mostly former Confederate) states after the right to vote was first given to all races by the 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. These laws, along with the literacy tests and local government acts of coercion, were used against black people and Native Americans. Hamer later paid for and acquired the requisite poll tax receipts.

As an example of how black citizens were disenfranchised in Mississippi, Hamer said that she &quot;had never heard, until 1962, that black people could register and vote.&quot;

Hamer began to become more involved in the activism of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee after these incidents. She attended many Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC), where she sometimes taught classes, and various SNCC (pronounced &quot;Snick&quot;) workshops. She traveled to gather signatures for petitions to attempt to be granted federal resources for impoverished black families across the South. In early 1963, she became a SNCC field secretary for voter registration and welfare programs. Many of these first attempts to register more black voters in Mississippi were met with the same problems Hamer had found in trying to register herself. 


=== White racist attacks ===

After she attempted to vote, Hamer was fired by her boss, but her husband was required to stay on the land until the end of the harvest. Hamer moved between homes over the next several days for protection. On September 10, 1962, while staying with friend Mary Tucker, Hamer was shot at 15 times in a drive-by shooting by racists. No one was injured in the event. The next day, Hamer and her family evacuated to nearby Tallahatchie County for three months, fearing retaliation by the Ku Klux Klan because she had attempted to vote.

===Police brutality===
On June 9, 1963, Hamer was returning from a voter registration workshop by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Charleston, South Carolina. Traveling by bus with co-activists, they stopped for a break in Winona, Mississippi. Some of the activists went inside a local cafe, but were refused service by the waitress. Shortly after, a Mississippi State highway patrolman took out his billy club and intimidated the activists into leaving. One of the group decided to take down the officer&#x27;s license plate number; while doing so the patrolman and a police chief entered the cafe and arrested the party. Hamer left the bus and inquired if they could continue their journey back to Greenwood, Mississippi. At that point the officers arrested her as well. Once in county jail, Hamer&#x27;s colleagues were beaten by the police in the booking room (including 15-year-old June Johnson, for not addressing officers as &quot;sir&quot;). Hamer was then taken to a cell where two inmates were ordered, by the state trooper, to beat her using a baton. The police ensured she was held down during the almost fatal beating, and when she started to scream, beat her further. Hamer was also groped repeatedly by officers during the assault. When she attempted to resist, she stated an officer, &quot;walked over, took my dress, pulled it up over my shoulders, leaving my body exposed to five men&quot;. Another in her group was beaten until she was unable to talk; a third, a teenager, was beaten, stomped on, and stripped. An activist from SNCC came the next day to see if he could help but was beaten until his eyes were swollen shut when he did not address an officer in the expected deferential manner.

Hamer was released on June 12, 1963. She needed more than a month to recuperate from the beatings and never fully recovered. Though the incident left profound physical and psychological effects, including a blood clot over her left eye and permanent damage on one of her kidneys, Hamer returned to Mississippi to organize voter registration drives, including the 1963 Freedom Ballot, a mock election, and the Freedom Summer initiative the following year. She was known to the volunteers of Freedom Summer as a motherly figure who believed that the civil rights effort should be multi-racial in nature. In addition to her &quot;Northern&quot; guests, Hamer played host to Tuskegee University student activists Sammy Younge Jr. and Wendell Paris. Younge and Paris grew to become profound activists and organizers under Hamer&#x27;s tutelage. Younge was murdered in 1966 at a gas station in Macon County, Alabama, for using a &quot;whites-only&quot; restroom.

===Freedom Democratic Party and Congressional run===
In 1964, Hamer helped co-found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), in an effort to prevent the regional all-white Democratic party&#x27;s attempts to stifle African-American voices, and to ensure there was a party for all people that did not stand for any form of exploitation and discrimination (especially towards minorities). Following the founding of the MFDP, Hamer and other activists traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention to stand as the official delegation from the state of Mississippi. Hamer&#x27;s televised testimony was interrupted because of a scheduled speech that President Lyndon B. Johnson made in the presence of 30 governors in the White House&#x27;s East Room, but most major news networks broadcast her testimony to the nation later that evening, giving Hamer and the MFDP much exposure.

Senator Hubert Humphrey tried to propose a compromise on Johnson&#x27;s behalf that would give the Freedom Democratic Party two seats. He said this would lead to a reformed convention in 1968. The MFDP rejected the compromise, with Hamer saying, &quot;We didn&#x27;t come all the way up here to compromise for no more than we&#x27;d gotten here. We didn&#x27;t come all this way for no two seats when all of us is tired.&quot; Afterward, all the white members from the Mississippi delegation walked out.

In 1968, the MFDP was finally seated after the Democratic Party adopted a clause that demanded equality of representation from their states&#x27; delegations. In 1972, Hamer was elected as a national party delegate.

Rhetorical practices

Hamer traveled around the country, speaking at colleges, universities, and institutions. She was not rich, as confirmed by her clothing and vernacular. Moreover, Hamer was a short and stocky poor black woman with a deep southern accent, which gave rise to ridicule in the minds of many in her audiences. Although she often gave speeches, she was often patronized by both black and white people because she was not formally educated. For instance, activists such as Roy Wilkins said Hamer was &quot;ignorant&quot;, and President Lyndon B. Johnson looked down on her. When Hamer was being considered to speak as a delegate at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Hubert Humphrey said: &quot;The President will not allow that illiterate woman to speak from the floor of the convention.&quot; 

In 1964, Hamer received an honorary degree from Tougaloo College, much to the dismay of a group of black intellectuals who thought she was undeserving of such an honor because she was &quot;unlettered&quot;. On the other hand, Hamer had supporters including Ella Baker, Bob Moses, Charles McLaurin, and Malcolm X who believed in her story and in her ability to speak. These supporters and others like them believed that despite Hamer&#x27;s illiteracy, &quot;People who have struggled to support themselves and large families, people who have survived in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi, have learned some things we need to know.&quot; Hamer was known to evoke strong emotions in listeners to her speeches indicative of her &quot;telling it like it is&quot; oratorical style.

Hamer&#x27;s style of speaking and connecting to audiences can be traced back to her upbringing and the black Baptist Church to which her family belonged, which many see as the source of her ability to compel audiences with words. Woven into her speeches was a deep level of confidence, biblical knowledge, and even comedy in a way that many did not think possible for someone without a formal education or access to &quot;institutionalized power&quot;. Hamer had seen her mother walk around with a concealed pistol in an attempt to protect her children from white land owners who were known to beat sharecroppers&#x27; children. 

Hamer&#x27;s mother instilled a sense of pride in being black when Hamer did not perceive that being black was a benefit during her childhood. Hamer&#x27;s father was a Baptist preacher who often entertained the family with jokes at the end of the day. Although Hamer made it only to sixth grade because she had to help the family work the fields, she excelled at reading, spelling, and poetry, and even won spelling bees. Her family encouraged her to recite her poetry to the family and their guests.

Hamer became a plantation timekeeper, a position that made her the point person who had to communicate with both the white land owners and the black sharecroppers, which helped her practice communicating to different kinds of people. After she got involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s, Hamer&#x27;s oratorical skills quickly became apparent. Leading activists were amazed at how she did not write her speeches but delivered them from memory. 

The Reverend Edwin King said of Hamer, &quot;She was an extraordinarily good cook of down-home foods...she liked to mix, to make whatever she was feeding people at midnight after they would come home from jail or somewhere else, to fix the perfect spices or recipe for her guest...after she became the orator, she began picking and choosing the spicy parts she&#x27;d put in her speeches. She was always doing the best she had with whatever she had. The food, or words, or voice or song—choosing among it what was needed to persuade or to comfort or to please.&quot; 

At speaking engagements, Hamer made speeches and also sang, often with the Freedom Singers. Charles Neblitt, one of its members, said of Hamer, &quot;We&#x27;d let her sing all the songs we did that she knew. She put her whole self into her singing, adding a power to the group...When somebody puts their inner self into a song, it moves people. Her singing showed the kind of dedication that she had—the struggle and the pain, the frustration and the hope... Her life would be in that song.&quot;

Hamer&#x27;s &quot;southern black vernacular&quot;, indicative of the denial of blacks&#x27;, particularly black Southerners&#x27;, access to standard American English, captures the feelings and experiences of black Southerners. According to Davis Houck and Maegan Parker Brooks in &quot;The Speeches of Fannie Lou Hamer&quot;, &quot;the designation &#x27;black&#x27; acknowledges aspects of Hamer&#x27;s racialized experience that influenced her speech. When describing Hamer&#x27;s discourse, we find the term &#x27;vernacular&#x27; more precise than either &#x27;dialect&#x27; or &#x27;language&#x27; because the etymology of &#x27;vernacular&#x27;—taken from the Latin &quot;vernaculus&quot; and &quot;verna&quot;—evokes a sense of being both &#x27;native to a region&#x27; and &#x27;subservient to something else.&#x27; In this respect, &#x27;vernacular&#x27; echoes the particularity indicated by the regional distinction, as it simultaneously represents the relationship of power and domination that Hamer challenged through her words.&quot;

One of Hamer&#x27;s most famous speeches was at Williams Institutional Church in Harlem on December 20, 1964, along with Malcolm X. In the speech, &quot;Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired&quot;, she chronicled the violence and injustices she experienced while trying to register to vote. While highlighting the various acts of brutality she experienced in the South, she was careful to tie in the fact that blacks in the North and all over the country were suffering the same oppression. The audience was one-third white and gave Hamer a warm reception.

==Freedom Farm Cooperative and later activism==

In 1964, Hamer unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. House. She continued to work on other projects, including grassroots-level Head Start programs and Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s Poor People&#x27;s Campaign. With the help of Julius Lester and Mary Varela, she published her autobiography in 1967. She said she was &quot;tired of all this beating&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s so much hate. Only God has kept the Negro sane&quot;.

Hamer sought equality across all aspects of society. In her view, African Americans were not free if they were not afforded the same opportunities as whites, including those in the agricultural industry. Sharecropping was the most common form of post-slavery activity and the main source of income in the South. The New Deal era expanded and, as a result, many blacks were physically and economically displaced due to the various projects initiated around the country. Hamer believed that blacks should not be dependent on any group, so she wanted to give them a voice through an agricultural movement.

Hamer was a staunch opponent of abortion, calling it &quot;legalized murder&quot; in a 1969 speech at the White House and describing her position in terms of her Christian faith. In &quot;Until I Am Free&quot;, historian Keisha N. Blain writes, &quot;Hamer viewed birth control and abortion as social justice issues. She feared that both were simply white supremacist tools to regulate the lives of impoverished Black people and even prevent the growth of the Black population.&quot;

James Eastland, a white senator, was one of the people who sought to keep African Americans disenfranchised and segregated from society. His influence on the overarching agricultural industry often suppressed minority groups to keep whites as the only power force in America. Hamer objected to this, and consequently, she pioneered the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC) in 1969, an attempt to redistribute economic power across groups and solidify an economic standing among African Americans. In the same vein as the Freedom Farm Collective, Hamer partnered with the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) to establish an interracial and interregional support program called The Pig Project to provide protein for people who previously could not afford meat.

Hamer made it her mission to make land more accessible to African Americans. To do this, she founded a small &quot;pig bank&quot; with a starting donation from the NCNW of five boars and fifty gilts. Through the pig bank, a family could care for a pregnant female pig until it bore its offspring; subsequently, they would raise the piglets and use them for food and financial gain. Within five years, thousands of pigs were available for breeding. Hamer used the success of the bank to begin fundraising for the main farming corporation. She was able to convince the then-editor of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;, James Fallows, to write an article that advocated for donations to the FFC. 

Eventually, the FFC raised about $8,000, which enabled Hamer to purchase 40 acres of land previously owned by a black farmer who could no longer afford to occupy it. This became the Freedom Farm. The farm had three main objectives: to establish an agricultural organization that could supplement the nutritional needs of America&#x27;s most disenfranchised people; to provide acceptable housing development; and create an entrepreneurial business incubator that would provide resources for new companies as well as retraining for those with limited education but manual labor experience.

Over time, the FFC offered various other services such as financial counseling, a scholarship fund and a housing agency. The FFC aided in securing 35 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) subsidized houses for struggling black families. Through her success, Hamer managed to acquire a new home, which served as inspiration for others to begin building themselves up. The FFC ultimately disbanded in 1975 due to lack of funding.

In 1971, Hamer co-founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. She emphasized the power women could hold by acting as a voting majority in the country regardless of race or ethnicity, saying: &quot;A white mother is no different from a black mother. The only thing is they haven&#x27;t had as many problems. But we cry the same tears.&quot;

==Later life and death==
In 1961, while undergoing surgery to remove a tumor, Hamer was also forced to undergo a hysterectomy by a white doctor without her consent; this medical procedure was frequently performed in accordance with Mississippi&#x27;s compulsory sterilization plan to reduce the number of poor blacks in the state. Hamer is credited with coining the phrase &quot;Mississippi appendectomy&quot;, a euphemism for involuntary or uninformed sterilization of black women, a common practice in the South during the 1960s. In January 1972, she was hospitalized for an extended period because she was suffering from nervous exhaustion, and after she suffered a nervous breakdown in January 1974, she was hospitalized again. By June 1974, Hamer was said to be in extremely poor health. Two years later, she was diagnosed with and underwent surgery for breast cancer.

Hamer died of complications from hypertension and breast cancer on March 14, 1977, aged 59, at Taborian Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi. She was buried in her hometown of Ruleville, Mississippi. Her tombstone is engraved with one of her famous quotes, &quot;I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.&quot;

Her primary memorial service, held at a church, was completely full. An overflow service was held at Ruleville Central High School, with over 1,500 people in attendance. Andrew Young, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, spoke at the RCHS service, saying &quot;None of us would be where we are now had she not been there then&quot;.

==Honors and awards==

Hamer received many awards both in her lifetime and posthumously. She received a Doctor of Law from Shaw University, and honorary degrees from Columbia College Chicago in 1970 and Howard University in 1972. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1993.

Hamer also received the Paul Robeson Award from Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, the Mary Church Terrell Award from Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the National Sojourner Truth Meritorious Service Award. She is an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta. A remembrance for her life was given in the US House of Representatives on the 100th anniversary of her birth, October 6, 2017, by Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.

On January 4, 2025, President Joe Biden awarded Hamer the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.

==Tributes==

In 1970, Ruleville Central High School held a &quot;Fannie Lou Hamer Day&quot;. Six years later, the City of Ruleville itself celebrated a &quot;Fannie Lou Hamer Day&quot;. In 1977, Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson wrote &quot;95 South (All of the Places We&#x27;ve Been)&quot;, in Hamer&#x27;s honor. Ta-Nehisi Coates described a 1994 live solo version of the song as &quot;a haunting and somber ode&quot;.

In 1994, the Ruleville post office was named the Fannie Lou Hamer Post Office by an act of Congress. Additionally, The Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy was founded in 1997 as a summer seminar and K–12 workshop program. In 2014 it was merged with the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) Civil Rights Education Complex on the campus of Jackson State University, Jackson, to create the Fannie Lou Hamer Institute @ COFO: A Human and Civil Rights Interdisciplinary Education Center. The Hamer Institute @ COFO provides a research library and outreach programs. There is also a Fannie Lou Hamer Public Library in Jackson.

A 2012 collection of suites by trumpeter and composer Wadada Leo Smith, who grew up in segregated Mississippi, &quot;Ten Freedom Summers&quot; includes &quot;Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964&quot; as one of its 19 suites. A picture book about Hamer&#x27;s life, &quot;Voice of Freedom: Fannie Lou Hamer, Spirit of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;, was written by Carole Boston Weatherford; it won a Coretta Scott King Award. Hamer is also one of 28 civil rights icons depicted on the Buffalo, New York Freedom Wall. And a quote from Hamer&#x27;s speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention is carved on one of the eleven granite columns at the Civil Rights Garden in Atlantic City, where the convention was held.

Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School was formed in the Bronx, New York, with a focus on humanities and social justice.
In 2017, the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center opened at the University of California at Berkeley.

In 2018, the Mississippi Democratic Party&#x27;s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner fundraiser was renamed the Hamer-Winter Dinner in honor of Hamer and former governor William Winter.

The third annual Women&#x27;s March, held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on January 19, 2019, was dedicated to Hamer&#x27;s life and legacy. Several hundred people attended, representing many organizations. Several students from Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School attended despite a state of emergency declared by New Jersey Governor Murphy due to an impending snowstorm.

Cheryl L. West wrote the play &quot;Fannie: The Music and Life of Fannie Lou Hamer&quot;, which premiered at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in 2022 as part of a co-production shared among Kenny Leon&#x27;s True Colors Theatre Company, the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, City Theatre Company, and DEMASKUS Theater Collective.

The band Chairman Dances&#x27; song &quot;Fannie Lou Hamer&quot; describes Hamer&#x27;s bus journey to Indianola, Mississippi, to register voters.

The gardener and podcaster Colah B. Tawkin cites Hamer as inspiration.

A historic marker for the Mississippi Freedom Trail was unveiled in Atlantic City, New Jersey on August 20, 2024. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves unveiled it at the site of the 1964 Democratic National Convention, honoring Hamer&#x27;s work advocating for an integrated delegation at the convention.

<text>Herbert John Yates (August 24, 1880 – February 3, 1966), a Hollywood mini-mogul, was the founder and President of Republic Pictures. With his contract, he had launched the film careers of such Western stars as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and John Wayne. Between 1935 and 1959, under the supervising leadership of Yates, Republic has produced 956 feature films and 66 multi-chapter cliffhanger serials, some of which are today considered classics, later broadcast on television and then released on home video.

==Early years==
Yates was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 24, 1880 to Charles Henry Yates and Emma Yates (née Worthington). He started his business career at an early age, building a newspaper sales business on the streets of Brooklyn. Later, he ascended from office boy to eastern regional sales manager of the American Tobacco Company, retiring from that company with a sizable fortune before the age of 30.

==Career==

Focusing on the movie and recording business, he built a small empire, acquiring record companies and film laboratories. In the 1920s he provided financing for Mack Sennett and Fatty Arbuckle.

In October 1929 his Consolidated Film Industries took control of ARC, the American Record Corporation, a company created as a result of a merger between a number of small dime store record labels. In the following years, the company was heavily involved in a depressed market for phonograph records, buying up failing labels at bargain prices to exploit their catalogues. In December 1931 Warner Bros. leased Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and associated companies to ARC. 

By 1932 ARC was king of the 3-records-for-a-dollar market, selling 6 million units, twice as much as competitor RCA Victor. In an effort to get back on top RCA launched the low-priced Bluebird Records label. ARC bought out the Columbia Records catalogue in 1934. During the 1930s, ARC produced the Brunswick and Columbia labels at 75c each and the Oriole (for McCrory), Romeo (for Kress), Melotone, Vocalion, Banner, Conqueror (for Sears), and Perfect labels at 35c each, or 3 records for $1.00.

In December 1938 the entire ARC complex was purchased from Consolidated Film for $700,000 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). After CBS brought back Columbia as their flagship label, they brought back the inactive OKeh Records label to replace Vocalion, which allowed the rights to the Brunswick and Vocalion labels to return to Warner Bros. They sold the rights to those labels to Decca Records in the early 1940s. In a complicated move, CBS managed to keep the rights to the ARC material from 1931 through 1938.

Yates formed Republic Pictures in 1935 by arranging for the merger of several smaller production companies with his Consolidated Film Industries, which was providing film processing and financing for many Hollywood studios. Among the merged companies were Mascot Pictures, which brought the serial to Republic, and also purchased the Mack Sennett lot in Studio City and Monogram Pictures. Under Yates&#x27; leadership, Republic first leased, and then purchased the lot, expanding it from six stages to nineteen and adding state-of-the-art production facilities.

In 1934 Gene Autry had his first film role in the Mascot production of &quot;In Old Santa Fe&quot;. Autry had been a recording artist under contract to Yates&#x27; American Record Corporation. He would go on to star in 56 feature films for Republic between 1935 and 1947. In 1938 Yates created a second American icon by giving Roy Rogers his first starring role in &quot;Under Western Stars&quot;. Rogers filled in for Autry during World War II and ended up making more than 80 films under the Republic banner.

Republic&#x27;s most acclaimed feature film was &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), directed by John Ford, and starring John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara. Ford had tried to make the Irish love story for years, but none of the studio heads would take a chance on it. Yates risked a budget of more than a million dollars, making possible the use of Technicolor (in lieu of Republic&#x27;s own Trucolor process) and location filming in Ireland. It earned triple its cost and earned Republic its only Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954), directed by Nicholas Ray and starring Joan Crawford, became another well regarded Republic picture.

==Personal life==

Yates had 3 children, a daughter and 2 sons.

In 1948 Yates left his wife Petra for the Czech figure skater Vera Hruba Ralston, with the couple marrying in 1952. He employed Vera&#x27;s brother Rudy Ralston as a producer at Republic.

In 1958 Yates was accused of exploiting Republic for his own gain, in particular his promotion of his wife&#x27;s career. It was alleged that 18 of her 20 films had been flops. 

Yates and Vera&#x27;s relatives were pushed out of Republic and the film business in 1959, the same year Republic&#x27;s board decided to switch emphasis from production to distribution, selling their controlling interest to Victor M. Carter for nearly $6 million. Yates became chairman of the board.

Yates died at his residence in Sherman Oaks in 1966.

==Legacy==

The Republic lot survives today as CBS Studio Center. Notable among Yates&#x27; contributions to the lot are the Mabel Normand sound stage, built during World War II and later home to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, and an award-winning music scoring auditorium that has hosted such famous names as Aaron Copland and Artur Rubinstein.

<doc id="992359" wikidata="Q18752255" url="?curid=992359" title="Tracht">
<text>Tracht () refers to traditional garments in German-speaking countries and regions. Although the word is most often associated with Bavarian, Austrian, South Tyrolean and Trentino garments, including lederhosen and dirndls, many other German-speaking peoples have them, as did the former Danube Swabian populations of Central Europe.

== Name ==
The word &quot;Tracht&quot; comes from the verb &quot;tragen&quot; (to carry or wear); thus the derived noun &quot;Tracht&quot; means &quot;what is worn&quot;. So &quot;Tracht&quot; can refer to the clothes which are worn. The noun also has other uses deriving from the verbal meaning, e.g. a load, a device for carrying a load on the shoulders, or the load of honey carried in by the bees). It also appears within the German idiom &quot;eine Tracht Prügel&quot; (a &quot;load&quot; (of) beating or, alternately, &quot;a good beating&quot;).

&quot;Tracht&quot; is commonly used to refer to the manner of dress associated with a particular ethnic group (&quot;Volkstracht&quot;), social class, or occupation (&quot;Arbeitstracht&quot;). Most often it refers to clothing, although it can also describe a way of cutting one&#x27;s hair (&quot;Haartracht&quot;) or beard (&quot;Barttracht&quot;).

==Descriptions of different tracht customs==

In northern Germany some of the best known examples are the &quot;Friesische Tracht&quot; and the Finkenwerder Tracht. The &quot;Friesische Tracht&quot; is richly decorated with beads and embroidery. The quality of the work was a sign of the riches and social status of the wives wearing it. In former times it was brought into a marriage by the bride as part of her dowry. This costume is occasionally still worn at weddings. The &quot;Finkenwerder Tracht&quot; is the traditional garment of the inhabitants of an island in the Elbe river. It is worn by a local folklore group called Finkwarder Speeldeel. 

 In the region of Baden in south-western Germany, the areas with strong tracht traditions are found predominantly in the Black Forest (&quot;Schwarzwald&quot;) and the surrounding region. The Bollenhut, a wide-brimmed hat with red pompoms, has become a symbol of the entire Black Forest, although it is traditionally worn only by unmarried women from the three villages of Kirnbach, Gutach and Reichenbach in the Gutach valley. The Schwarzwälder Trachtenmuseum in Haslach (in the Kinzig valley) displays more than 100 life-size figures in tracht costume, giving an overview of the variety of traditional tracht costumes in the Black Forest. Other displays of tracht from the region are found in the Trachtenmuseum Seebach, as well as many Heimat museums in the region. Local tracht associations in the area encourage the wearing of traditional costume, often with a view to promoting tourism; sometimes these tracht costumes have been recently created. 

In Bavaria, the best-known folk costume is undoubtedly the Alpine tracht of Upper Bavaria, consisting of lederhosen for the &quot;Buam&quot; (man) and the dirndl for the &quot;Madl&quot; (woman). Today six traditional subtypes of the Alpine tracht are recognised in Bavaria: Miesbacher Tracht, Werdenfelser Tracht, Inntaler Tracht, Chiemgauer Tracht, Berchtesgadener Tracht and Isarwinkler Tracht. The Alpine tracht has also been adopted as traditional dress in regions beyond the Alps, through promotion by tracht associations and migration in search of work; consequently, it is now understood as &quot;the&quot; German folk costume. However, there are still a great many other traditional tracht designs in Bavaria, mostly worn only regionally. These include the Dachauer Tracht, the Priener hat or the more recently arisen Herrschinger Hosenträger (braces / suspenders). 

Displaced German peoples like the Sudetendeutsche often used events where they wore Tracht to emphasize their unity.

Costumes worn by professional guilds, habits of religious orders, deaconesses, and the historical garment of some occupational groups (e.g. nurses) are also called &quot;Tracht&quot;. While some of them have fallen into disuse, carpenter journeymen can still be seen wearing their traditional garment while traveling throughout Europe.

==History==
Folk costumes originated in rural areas. They showed that the wearer belonged to a particular social class, occupation, religious persuasion or ethnic group. In the country, the folk costumes developed differently from one another. They were influenced by urban fashions, costumes in neighbouring regions, available materials, as well as fashions in the royal courts and in the military. The earliest known folk costumes developed at the end of the 15th century. Although folk costumes varied in practice between everyday and festive versions, the festive version of each costume tradition was considered the ideal form. 

The history of tracht in the 19th century is inseparable from the history of the movement in German-speaking countries to promote folk costume (&quot;Trachtenbewegung&quot;). The idea of an approved folk costume dates back to the 18th century, and was promoted by the Swedish king Gustav III. At the beginning of the 19th century, enthusiasm for the different costumes of the rural population developed at the royal courts of Bavaria and Austria. The interest in traditional costume was part of a wider cultural response to the humiliations suffered through the repeated foreign invasions during the Napoleonic Wars. The German-speaking peoples investigated their cultural heritage as a reaffirmation of their identity. The result was a flowering of research and artistic work centred around Germanic cultural traditions, expressed in painting, literature, architecture, music and promotion of German language and folklore. 

The first extensive description of traditional tracht in the different regions was given by the Bavarian official Joseph von Hazzi (1768–1845). A comprehensive description of Bavarian national costumes was published in 1830 by the archivist Felix Joseph von Lipowsky. A parade of traditional costumes took place in 1835 at Oktoberfest, to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Queen Therese. Under his successor Maximilian II, traditional costumes were officially recognised as clothing suitable for wearing at the royal court. The king himself included officials wearing tracht in his court ceremonies and wrote in 1849 that he considered the wearing of traditional dress of &quot;great importance&quot; for national sentiment.

In 1859, the first association to promote traditional costume was founded in Miesbach in Bavaria. In the following years, similar tracht associations (&quot;Trachtenvereine&quot;) were founded throughout Germany and Austria. The first umbrella organisation for the tracht associations was founded in 1890. In 1895, the Bavarian novelist Maximilian Schmidt organized a parade of traditional costume at Oktoberfest, with 1,400 participants in 150 traditional costume groups.

<text>The Ontario New Democratic Party elects its leaders by secret ballot of the party members and/or their delegates at leadership elections, as did its predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section). The party leader can be challenged for the leadership at the party&#x27;s biennial convention. The Ontario New Democratic Party is a social democratic political party in Ontario, Canada.

From 1934 until 1942, the president of the Ontario CCF acted as the party&#x27;s spokesperson and leader during election campaigns. John Mitchell, a Hamilton alderman, was CCF president from 1934 until 1941. Samuel Lawrence, former Ontario CCF MPP for Hamilton East was elected party president in 1941 and recommended that the party elect a leader in 1942.

<text>Festival Express is a 2003 British documentary film about the 1970 train tour of the same name across Canada taken by some of North America&#x27;s most popular rock bands, including Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Buddy Guy, Flying Burrito Bros, Ian &amp; Sylvia&#x27;s Great Speckled Bird, Mountain and Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends. The film combines footage of the 1970 concerts and on the train, interspersed with contemporary recollections of the tour by its participants.

The film, released by THINKFilm in the United States and Optimum Releasing in the United Kingdom, was produced by Gavin Poolman (son of the original 1970 film shoot&#x27;s producer, Willem Poolman) together with John Trapman, and directed by double Grammy Award-winner Bob Smeaton, with music produced by Eddie Kramer and featuring original footage shot in 1970 by Academy Award–winning cinematographer Peter Biziou. The original 1970 footage was filmed by director Frank Cvitanovich. A DVD release followed the film&#x27;s 2003 theatrical run.

==Concert tour==
&quot;Festival Express&quot; was staged in three Canadian cities: Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary, during the summer of 1970. Rather than flying into each city, the musicians traveled by chartered Canadian National Railways train, in a total of 14 cars (two engines, one diner, five sleepers, two lounge cars, two flat cars, one baggage car, and one staff car). The train journey between cities ultimately became a combination of non-stop jam sessions and partying fueled by alcohol. One highlight of the documentary is a drunken jam session featuring The Band&#x27;s Rick Danko, the Grateful Dead&#x27;s Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, New Riders of the Purple Sage&#x27;s John Dawson, as well as Janis Joplin.

The event, initially billed as the &quot;Transcontinental Pop Festival&quot;, was developed and conceived by Ken Walker and promoted by Eaton-Walker Associates (consisting of Thor Eaton, George Eaton, and Ken Walker) and the concerts were produced and financed together with Industrial and Trade Shows of Canada (ITS) division of MacLean-Hunter Publishing Company and originally included the following cities:

The Montreal event was cancelled a few weeks before the scheduled date by Lucien Saulnier, chairman of the City of Montreal Executive Committee (and acting under authority of mayor Jean Drapeau), because it clashed with St. Jean-Baptiste Day (June 24) celebrations and there were concerns about a diluted security force and the potential for violence. Buses were run from Montreal to the Toronto Festival Express stop and Montreal tickets were honored in Toronto. The Vancouver venue, Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) Empire Stadium, could not be secured as they were scheduled to have artificial turf (Tartan Turf) installed shortly before the scheduled event, and there was concern about damage to the turf. In March, 1970, Walker requested use of an alternate venue, Capilano Stadium, for the event, but this was denied by the Vancouver City Council over several concerns, including inadequate sanitary and food facilities, challenges with policing the event, and vagrancy. Therefore, Vancouver was dropped from the tour, and Calgary was subsequently added. The event in Calgary was initially to be held in an open field, Paskapoo Ski Hill (to later become Canada Olympic Park), but the city requested it be held at McMahon Stadium instead, as it would permit better organization and security.

The tour ultimately began in Toronto at the CNE Grandstand, which was plagued with about 2,500 protestors who objected to what they viewed as exploitation by promoters charging $14 per ticket. The opposition was organized by the May 4th Movement (M4M), the left-rebel group that grew out of the May 4, 1970 Kent State shootings. They attempted to crash the gates and scale the fence, and clashed with police, resulting in injuries to both protesters and policemen. To help calm the crowd, Metro Police Inspector Walter Magahay asked the promoter, Ken Walker, to lower ticket prices, but this would have left the promoters unable to pay the musicians. Subsequently, Jerry Garcia, in conjunction with Magahay, was instrumental in calming the unruly crowd by arranging a spontaneous free &quot;rehearsal&quot; concert in nearby Coronation Park upon a flatbed truck, while the scheduled show continued at the stadium. Once the free concert, which began at about 7:00pm on June 27, was announced, most of the ticketless fans dispersed to Coronation Park, with an initial attendance of about 6,000, thereby resolving the protest. Once the show at the CNE Grandstand ended at 12:30am, another 6,000 fans went to the park for the remainder of the free concert, which lasted until about 4:00am on June 28. Playing at Coronation Park were The Grateful Dead, Ian &amp; Sylvia and the Great Speckled Bird, James and the Good Brothers, the New Riders of the Purple Sage (all of whom also performed at the CNE concert). Other local Toronto bands also played, including January, The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Concert Band, Si Potma and P.M. Howard (of &quot;Beatlemania&quot; fame). There are some reports indicating a free concert was also performed on the second day, albeit to a much smaller crowd of about 500, as many of the protesters paid admission to the event on the second day. Many people spent the night and following day sleeping in the park until the second show at CNE Grandstand ended at 12:30am on June 29.

On the way to Winnipeg, the second stop on the tour, the train stopped in Chapleau, Ontario, to replenish its dwindling alcohol supply, buying out the entire stock of a small liquor store. The Winnipeg show had only a modest turnout of 4,600, partly due to fears about crowd violence based on the events in Toronto and partly due to the Manitoba Centennial appearance by Prime Minister Trudeau. The event was not plagued by protests or violence, however.

In Calgary, the third and final stop, the police wished to avoid the protests witnessed in Toronto and their presence seemed to subdue the crowds outside the stadium, though there were many complaints about the ticket prices. It was estimated that about 1,000 people managed to sneak in on Saturday by climbing fences early in the day, but security was tightened, and by the afternoon and Sunday, fewer people managed to breach the fences. However, there was a heated altercation between promoter Ken Walker and Calgary mayor Rod Sykes after Sykes strongly suggested to Walker on Sunday afternoon that he open the gates and let the kids in free after the show was well underway. Walker, who was livid about the mayor&#x27;s intrusion and his reference to Walker as &quot;Eastern scum&quot; &quot;trying to skim&quot; the young people of Calgary, claimed to have punched the mayor in the mouth, and boasted that he still had a scar on his hand to prove it.

The tour had an original budget of about $900,000 (of which $500,000 was for musical talent), but largely due to less than predicted turnout, gross receipts were just over $500,000 and the project ultimately lost between $350,000 and $500,000 for the promoters. Although the tour was a financial failure, it produced many notable performances, including some of the final performances by Janis Joplin, who would die about three months after the end of the tour. In the film, Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead said, &quot;Woodstock was a treat for the audience, but the train was a treat for the performers.&quot; Jerry Garcia later said that what he remembers most about the tour is being &quot;so blisteringly drunk&quot;.

The 13 track disc collected many of the previously released recordings, along with 6 which were previously unreleased. Five filmed performances (&quot;Tell Mama&quot;, &quot;Kozmic Blues&quot;, &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, &quot;Try (Just A Little Bit Harder)&quot; and &quot;Move Over&quot;) were featured in the 1974 film, &quot;Janis&quot;.

==Other festival performers==
These festival performers were not featured in the film or DVD extras:
* Robert Charlebois
* Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends (Delaney Bramlett sits in with Great Speckled Bird during &quot;C.C. Rider&quot; and Bonnie Bramlett can be seen on the train; their saxophonist Jerry Jumonville also appears.)

* Traffic (performed only in Toronto; on the DVD, promoter Ken Walker states that Traffic was on the train, but the band&#x27;s record company wouldn&#x27;t allow them to appear in the film. Two performances were filmed; however, according to film producer Gavin Poolman in May 2011, Steve Winwood&#x27;s management refused permission for these to appear in the film.)
* The New Riders of the Purple Sage, which, in mid-1970, featured Jerry Garcia on pedal-steel guitar, as well as Mickey Hart as occasional percussionist. Also, John Dawson is seen in the &quot;Ain&#x27;t No More Cane&quot; scene, sitting on the couch with Rick Danko and Janis Joplin, as they work through several drunken verses of the tune. Buddy Cage can also be seen, performing as a member of Great Speckled Bird.

==Film production==
Because the Festival Express tour turned out to be a complete financial disaster, the promoters injuncted the film footage and the film project was shelved soon afterwards, as the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film&#x27;s reels turned up in the garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin when he was a teenager.

The plan to resurrect the film was started in 1999 by executive producer Garth Douglas and story consultant James Cullingham, who found many more reels in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where it had been kept in pristine condition, unknown to the world. Garth got in touch with Gavin, who had grown up to become a film producer based in London, England. Gavin put the film together with his old high school friend John Trapman, and Bob Smeaton, double Grammy Award-winning director of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, was brought on board.

The music tracks were mixed at Toronto&#x27;s MetalWorks Studios and produced by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s producer, and engineer for Led Zeppelin, &quot;Woodstock&quot;, and &quot;Derek &amp; The Dominos Live In Concert&quot;. The film was produced by London-based Apollo Films (a division of Apollo Media) together with PeachTree Films in Amsterdam.

==Legacy==

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros joined The Railroad Revival Tour in April 2011 with Mumford and Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show. Traveling in vintage rail cars, the three bands performed in six &quot;unique outdoor locations&quot; over the course of a week starting in Oakland, California. The musical documentary &quot;Big Easy Express&quot;, which was made of the trip and directed by Emmett Malloy, premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival (SXSW Film) in Austin, Texas.

<text>The Aero A.102 was a Czechoslovakian fighter aircraft that flew in prototype form in 1934. It was developed in response to a Czech Air Force requirement of that year, but was passed over in favour of the Avia B.35.

The A.102 was of gull winged monoplane configuration with tailwheel undercarriage, and was perhaps inspired by the successful PZL P.11.

<text>Donald Rodney Justice (August 12, 1925 – August 6, 2004) was an American poet and teacher of creative writing who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1980.

==Early life and education==
Justice was born on August 12, 1925, in Miami. He attended the University of Miami, where he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1945. He received an MA from the University of North Carolina in 1947, studied for a time at Stanford University, and earned a doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1954. 

==Career==
After obtaining his doctorate, Justice went on to teach for many years at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa, the nation&#x27;s first graduate program in creative writing. He also taught at Syracuse University, the University of California at Irvine, Princeton University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Justice published thirteen collections of his poetry. The first collection, &quot;The Summer Anniversaries&quot;, was the winner of the Lamont Poetry Prize given by the Academy of American Poets in 1961; &quot;Selected Poems&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1980. He was awarded the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1991, and the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry in 1996.

His honors also included grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1997 to 2003. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was nominated for the National Book Award in 2004. Justice was a National Book Award Finalist three times, in 1961, 1974, and 1995.

==Death==
Justice died August 6, 2004, at an Iowa City, Iowa nursing home. He had been in a nursing home after suffering a stroke several weeks before his death. He was 78 years old. His family said the immediate cause of death was pneumonia, but that he also had Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Legacy==

In his obituary for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Andrew Rosenheim wrote that Justice &quot;was a legendary teacher, and despite his own Formalist reputation influenced a wide range of younger writers — his students included Mark Jarman, Rita Dove, James Tate, C. Dale Young, Ellen Bryant Voigt, Will Schmitz, Mark Strand, William Stafford, Larry Levis, and the novelist John Irving.&quot; His student and later colleague Marvin Bell said, &quot;As a teacher, Don chose always to be on the side of the poem, defending it from half-baked attacks by students anxious to defend their own turf. While he had firm preferences in private, as a teacher Don defended all turfs. He had little use for poetic theory...&quot;

Justice&#x27;s former student, the poet and critic Tad Richards, noted that, &quot;Donald Justice is likely to be remembered as a poet who gave his age a quiet but compelling insight into loss and distance, and who set a standard for craftsmanship, attention to detail, and subtleties of rhythm.&quot;

Justice&#x27;s work was the subject of the 1998 volume &quot;Certain Solitudes: On The Poetry of Donald Justice&quot;, a collection of essays edited by Dana Gioia and William Logan.

<text>Frenchy the Clown is the title character in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Evil Clown Comics&quot;, which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Nick Bakay created the Evil Clown storyline for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; utilizing Alan Kupperberg as the illustrator. Frenchy the Clown, the comic strip&#x27;s main character, was not only bitter and evil, but had a &quot;way with the ladies&quot; and was often depicted in fairly sexually explicit scenes. According to Bakay&#x27;s official website, he wrote these comics when he was &quot;ever so slightly embittered and pissed off at the world&quot;. It was humorous, and even pushed the envelope of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s lack of political correctness; the magazine&#x27;s lawyers refused publication of one panel in a subsequently published story.

<doc id="992412" wikidata="Q1429342" url="?curid=992412" title="Wireless distribution system">
<text>A wireless distribution system (WDS) is a system enabling the wireless interconnection of access points in an IEEE 802.11 network. It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the traditional requirement for a wired backbone to link them. The notable advantage of WDS over other solutions is that it preserves the MAC addresses of client frames across links between access points.

An access point can be either a main, relay, or remote base station.

* A main base station is typically connected to the (wired) Ethernet. 
* A relay base station relays data between remote base stations, wireless clients, or other relay stations; to either a main, or another relay base station. 
* A remote base station accepts connections from wireless clients and passes them on to relay stations or to main stations. Connections between &quot;clients&quot; are made using MAC addresses.

All base stations in a wireless distribution system must be configured to use the same radio channel, method of encryption (none, WEP, WPA or WPA2) and the same encryption keys. They may be configured to different service set identifiers (SSIDs). WDS also requires every base station to be configured to forward to others in the system.

WDS may also be considered a repeater mode because it appears to bridge and accept wireless clients at the same time (unlike traditional bridging). However, with the repeater method, throughput is halved for all clients connected wirelessly. This is because Wi-Fi is an inherently half duplex medium and therefore any Wi-Fi device functioning as a repeater must use the Store and forward method of communication.

WDS may be incompatible between different products (even occasionally from the same vendor) since the IEEE 802.11-1999 standard does not define how to construct any such implementations or how stations interact to arrange for exchanging frames of this format. The IEEE 802.11-1999 standard merely defines the 4-address frame format that makes it possible.

==Technical==
WDS may provide two modes of access point-to-access point (AP-to-AP) connectivity:
* Wireless bridging, in which WDS APs (AP-to-AP on local routers AP) communicate only with each other and &quot;don&#x27;t allow wireless stations (STA, also known as wireless clients) to access them&quot;
* Wireless repeating, in which APs (WDS on local routers) communicate with each other &quot;and with wireless STAs&quot;

Two disadvantages to using WDS are:
* The maximum wireless effective throughput may be halved after the first retransmission (hop) being made. For example, in the case of two APs connected via WDS, and communication is made between a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP A and a laptop which is connected wirelessly to AP B. The throughput is halved, because AP B has to retransmit the information during the communication of the two sides. However, in the case of communications between a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP A and a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP B, the throughput is not halved since there is no need to retransmit the information. Dual band/radio APs may avoid this problem, by connecting to clients on one band/radio, and making a WDS network link with the other.
* Dynamically assigned and rotated encryption keys are usually not supported in a WDS connection. This means that dynamic Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and other dynamic key assignment technology in most cases cannot be used, though WPA using pre-shared keys is possible. This is due to the lack of standardization in this field, which may be resolved with the upcoming 802.11s standard. As a result, only static WEP or WPA keys may be used in a WDS connection, including any STAs that associate to a WDS repeating AP.

OpenWRT, a universal third party router firmware, supports WDS with WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK, WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed-Mode encryption modes. Recent Apple base stations allow WDS with WPA, though in some cases firmware updates are required. Firmware for the Renasis SAP36g super access point and most third party firmware for the Linksys WRT54G(S)/GL support AES encryption using WPA2-PSK mixed-mode security, and TKIP encryption using WPA-PSK, while operating in WDS mode. However, this mode may not be compatible with other units running stock or alternate firmware.

==Example==
Suppose one has a Wi-Fi-capable game console. This device needs to send one packet to a WAN host, and receive one packet in reply.

* Network 1: A wireless base station acting as a simple (non-WDS) wireless router. The packet leaves the game console, goes over-the-air to the router, which then transmits it across the WAN. One packet comes back, through the router, which transmits it wirelessly to the game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 2.
*Network 2: Two wireless base stations employing WDS: WAN connects to the master base station. The master base station connects over-the-air to the remote base station. The Remote base station connects over-the-air to the game console. The game console sends one packet over-the-air to the remote base station, which forwards it over-the-air to the master base station, which forwards it to the WAN. The reply packet comes from the WAN to the master base station, over-the-air to the remote, and then over-the-air again to the game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 4.
*Network 3: Two wireless base stations employing WDS, but this time the game console connects by Ethernet cable to the remote base station. One packet is sent from the game console over the Ethernet cable to the remote, from there by air to the master, and on to the WAN. Reply comes from WAN to master, over-the-air to remote, over cable to game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 2.

Notice that network 1 (non-WDS) and network 3 (WDS) send the same number of packets over-the-air. The only slowdown is the potential halving due to the half-duplex nature of Wi-Fi.

Network 2 gets an additional halving because the remote base station uses double the air time because it is re-transmitting over-the-air packets that it has just received over-the-air. This is the halving that is usually attributed to WDS, but that halving only happens when the route through a base station uses over-the-air links on both sides of it. That does not always happen in a WDS, and can happen in non-WDS.

Important Note: This &quot;double hop&quot; (one wireless hop from the main station to the remote station, and a second hop from the remote station to the wireless client [game console]) is not necessarily twice as slow. End to end latency introduced here is in the &quot;store and forward&quot; delay associated with the remote station forwarding packets. In order to accurately identify the true latency contribution of relaying through a wireless remote station vs. simply increasing the broadcast power of the main station, more comprehensive tests specific to the environment would be required.

<doc id="992419" wikidata="Q1479868" url="?curid=992419" title="Rock 'n' Roll High School">
<text>Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School is a 1979 American musical comedy film directed by Allan Arkush, produced by Michael Finnell, and starring P. J. Soles, Vince Van Patten, Clint Howard and Dey Young. The film features the punk rock group Ramones.

==Plot==
Vince Lombardi High School keeps losing principals to nervous breakdowns because of the students&#x27; love of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and their disregard for education. The leader of the students, Riff Randell, is the biggest Ramones fan at the school and also the worst behavioral problem, in that her disciplinary record fills an entire filing cabinet. She waits in line for three days to get tickets to see the band, hoping to meet Joey Ramone so she can give him a song she wrote for the band, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;.

When the tyrannical Principal Togar takes her ticket away, Riff and her best friend Kate Rambeau have to find another way to meet their heroes: winning a radio contest. Riff succeeds in delivering her song to Joey Ramone, but the next day Principal Togar and a group of parents attempt to burn a pile of rock records. In response, the students, joined by the Ramones (who are made honorary students), overthrow the teachers and hall monitors to take over the high school, with Principal Togar asking the musicians &quot;Do your parents know you&#x27;re Ramones?&quot; When the police are summoned and demand that the students evacuate the building, they do so, but then the students and the Ramones burn down the school as a final act of youthful rebellion.

==Cast==
==Production==
Roger Corman, executive producer of the film, was looking to make a modern teen film similar to the ones he made in his early career during the 1960s, with the focus on current music of the time. The initial title &quot;Disco High&quot; was selected for a story idea from Allan Arkush and Joe Dante. A script was developed by Richard Whitley, Russ Dvonch, and Joseph McBride. During this time, the film went through several different title changes including &quot;Heavy Metal Kids&quot; and &quot;Girl&#x27;s Gym&quot;. Arkush directed the majority of the film, but Dante also helped when Arkush was suffering from exhaustion.

Corman originally wanted Cheap Trick or Todd Rundgren to play the band, but due to schedule conflicts, he was forced to find an alternative. The Ramones were suggested by Paul Bartel, one of the actors in the film.

The genesis for the plot was a favorite story told to the film&#x27;s original writer by his father, Raymond E. McBride of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot;, who staged a walkout from his Superior (Wis.) Central High school in the 1920s.

The film was shot on the campus of the defunct Mount Carmel High School in South Central Los Angeles, which had been closed in 1976. The nighttime school explosions and fires were so great that many people were scared away and, temporarily, would not return to the on-campus sets. Extras were students from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, California. The opening sequence, the food fight scene, and the dance number “Do You Wanna Dance” featured the drill team and football team wearing their actual uniforms from MCHS.

==Release==
The film had a sneak preview in Hollywood. It then had showings in Texas and New Mexico in April, 1979. It then went to San Francisco, then in July to Chicago, and opened in Manhattan on August 3 of that year, then continued on to further markets.

===Home media===
&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; was originally released on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1983, and was later re-released on VHS in 1996 by New Horizons Home Video (). A year later, in 1997, it was issued on DVD by Lumivision. A second DVD release occurred in 1999 from Slingshot. Shortly after Joey Ramone&#x27;s death in 2001, New Concorde produced a third DVD release. The film was once again issued on DVD in 2005 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment ( ). DVDs in the PAL format were issued by Umbrella Entertainment in 2003 () and again in 2007 ().

The film was a part of Shout! Factory&#x27;s &quot;Roger Corman Cult Classics&quot; series, reissued on DVD in May 2010. Shout! Factory released the film with exclusive content on Blu-ray on May 11, 2010 and again on November 19, 2019, with a new 4K restoration.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack album on Sire/Warner Bros. Records was released around the same time, but it included only a limited number of songs from the film. The two main Ramones songs (the title song and &quot;I Want You Around&quot;) were recorded by Ed Stasium but remixed by Phil Spector for the soundtrack album. The original Ed Stasium mixes were not issued until the compilation album &quot;Ramones Mania&quot; (1988) and the compilation album &quot;Hey! Ho! Let&#x27;s Go: The Anthology&quot; (1999), respectively.


Other songs appearing in the film include:
* Bent Fabric – &quot;Alley Cat&quot;
* Brian Eno – &quot;Spirits Drifting&quot;
* Brian Eno – &quot;Alternative 3&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;the plot owes something to &quot;Animal House&quot; (but &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; is funnier) and something to &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; and something to many other movies too numerous to mention; it is not, how you say, original.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; opined: &quot;It has the look of &quot;Grease&quot; and the soul of &quot;Animal House&quot;—and it&#x27;s better than both. The anarchic rock of The Ramones electrifies the film with a driving beat that never lets up. The film, like rock and roll, is just plain fun.&quot;

==Sequel==
In 1991 a sequel called &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School Forever&quot; was released. The sequel starred Corey Feldman. Mary Woronov, who played Miss Togar in the original film, appeared in the sequel as Vice Principal Doctor Vadar. The movie was met with poor reviews but over the years it has gained a cult following.

==Proposed remake==
In July 2008, actor/writer Alex Winter was hired to script a remake of the film for Howard Stern&#x27;s production company.

==In other media==
Corman&#x27;s short-lived comic book publishing imprint, Roger Corman&#x27;s Cosmic Comics, released a two-issue take on the film in 1995, written by Bob Fingerman with art by Shane Oakley and Jason Lutes. Unable to acquire likeness licenses for the Ramones, the comic instead featured the Melvins.

<text>Cisco PIX (Private Internet eXchange) was a popular IP firewall and network address translation (NAT) appliance. It was one of the first products in this market segment.

In 2005, Cisco introduced the newer Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (Cisco ASA), that inherited many of the PIX features, and in 2008 announced PIX end-of-sale.

The PIX technology was sold in a blade, the FireWall Services Module (FWSM), for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch series and the 7600 Router series, but has reached end of support status as of September 26, 2007.

==PIX==
=== History ===
PIX was originally conceived in early 1994 by John Mayes of Redwood City, California and designed and coded by Brantley Coile of Athens, Georgia. The PIX name is derived from its creators&#x27; aim of creating the functional equivalent of an IP PBX to solve the then-emerging registered IP address shortage. At a time when NAT was just being investigated as a viable approach, they wanted to conceal a block or blocks of IP addresses behind a single or multiple registered IP addresses, much as PBXs do for internal phone extensions. When they began, RFC 1597 and RFC 1631 were being discussed, but the now-familiar RFC 1918 had not yet been submitted.

The design, and testing were carried out in 1994 by John Mayes, Brantley Coile and Johnson Wu of Network Translation, Inc., with Brantley Coile being the sole software developer. Beta testing of PIX serial number 000000 was completed and first customer acceptance was on December 21, 1994 at KLA Instruments in San Jose, California. The PIX quickly became one of the leading enterprise firewall products and was awarded the Data Communications Magazine &quot;Hot Product of the Year&quot; award in January 1995.

Shortly before Cisco acquired Network Translation in November 1995, Mayes and Coile hired two longtime associates, Richard (Chip) Howes and Pete Tenereillo, and shortly after acquisition 2 more longtime associates, Jim Jordan and Tom Bohannon. Together they continued development on Finesse OS and the original version of the Cisco PIX Firewall, now known as the PIX &quot;Classic&quot;. During this time, the PIX shared most of its code with another Cisco product, the LocalDirector.

On January 28, 2008, Cisco announced the end-of-sale and end-of-life dates for all Cisco PIX Security Appliances, software, accessories, and licenses. The last day for purchasing Cisco PIX Security Appliance platforms and bundles was July 28, 2008. The last day to purchase accessories and licenses was January 27, 2009. Cisco ended support for Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers on July 29, 2013.

In May 2005, Cisco introduced the ASA which combines functionality from the PIX, VPN 3000 series and IPS product lines. The ASA series of devices run PIX code 7.0 and later. Through PIX OS release 7.x the PIX and the ASA use the same software images. Beginning with PIX OS version 8.x, the operating system code diverges, with the ASA using a Linux kernel and PIX continuing to use the traditional Finesse/PIX OS combination.

=== Software ===
The PIX runs a custom-written proprietary operating system originally called Finese (&quot;Fast Internet Service Executive&quot;), but the software is known simply as PIX OS. Though classified as a network-layer firewall with stateful inspection, technically the PIX would more precisely be called a Layer 4, or Transport Layer Firewall, as its access is not restricted to Network Layer routing, but socket-based connections (a port and an IP Address: port communications occur at Layer 4). By default it allows internal connections out (outbound traffic), and only allows inbound traffic that is a response to a valid request or is allowed by an Access Control List (ACL) or by a &quot;conduit&quot;. Administrators can configure the PIX to perform many functions including network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), as well as serving as a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint appliance.

The PIX became the first commercially available firewall product to introduce protocol specific filtering with the introduction of the &quot;fixup&quot; command. The PIX &quot;fixup&quot; capability allows the firewall to apply additional security policies to connections identified as using specific protocols. Protocols for which specific fixup behaviors were developed include DNS and SMTP. The DNS fixup originally implemented a very simple but effective security policy; it allowed just one DNS response from a DNS server on the Internet (known as &quot;outside&quot; interface) for each DNS request from a client on the protected (known as &quot;inside&quot;) interface. &quot;Inspect&quot; has superseded &quot;fixup&quot; in later versions of PIX OS.

The Cisco PIX was also one of the first commercially available security appliances to incorporate IPSec VPN gateway functionality.

Administrators can manage the PIX via a command line interface (CLI) or via a graphical user interface (GUI). They can access the CLI from the serial console, telnet and SSH. GUI administration originated with version 4.1, and it has been through several incarnations:

* PIX Firewall Manager (PFM) for PIX OS versions 4.x and 5.x, which runs locally on a Windows NT client
* PIX Device Manager (PDM) for PIX OS version 6.x, which runs over https and requires Java
* Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) for PIX OS version 7 and greater, which can run locally on a client or in reduced-functionality mode over HTTPS.

Because Cisco acquired the PIX from Network Translation, the CLI originally did not align with the Cisco IOS syntax. Starting with version 7.0, the configuration became much more IOS-like.

=== Hardware ===
The original NTI PIX and the PIX Classic had cases that were sourced from OEM provider Appro. All flash cards and the early encryption acceleration cards, the PIX-PL and PIX-PL2, were sourced from Productivity Enhancement Products (PEP). Later models had cases from Cisco OEM manufacturers.

The PIX was constructed using Intel-based/Intel-compatible motherboards; the PIX 501 used an Am5x86 processor, and all other standalone models used Intel 80486 through Pentium III processors.

The PIX boots off a proprietary ISA flash memory daughtercard in the case of the NTI PIX, PIX Classic, 10000, 510, 520, and 535, and it boots off integrated flash memory in the case of the PIX 501, 506/506e, 515/515e, 525, and WS-SVC-FWM-1-K9. The latter is the part code for the PIX technology implemented in the Fire Wall Services Module, for the Catalyst 6500 and the 7600 Router.

== Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) ==
The Adaptive Security Appliance is a network firewall made by Cisco. It was introduced in 2005 to replace the Cisco PIX line. Along with stateful firewall functionality another focus of the ASA is Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality. It also features intrusion prevention and Voice over IP. The ASA 5500 series was followed up by the 5500-X series. The 5500-X series focuses more on virtualization than it does on hardware acceleration security modules.

=== History ===
In 2005 Cisco released the 5510, 5520, and 5540 models.

=== Software ===
The ASA continues using the PIX codebase but, when the ASA OS software transitioned from major version 7.X to 8.X, it moved from the Finesse/Pix OS operating system platform to the Linux operating system platform. It also integrates features of the Cisco IPS 4200 intrusion prevention system, and the Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator.

=== Hardware ===
The ASA continues the PIX lineage of Intel 80x86 hardware.

== Security vulnerabilities ==
The Cisco PIX VPN product was hacked by the NSA-tied group Equation Group sometime before 2016. Equation Group developed a tool code-named BENIGNCERTAIN that reveals the pre-shared password(s) to the attacker (). Equation Group was later hacked by another group called The Shadow Brokers, which published their exploit publicly, among others. According to Ars Technica, the NSA likely used this vulnerability to wiretap VPN-connections for more than a decade, citing the Snowden leaks.

The Cisco ASA-brand was also hacked by Equation Group. The vulnerability requires that both SSH and SNMP are accessible to the attacker. The codename given to this exploit by NSA was EXTRABACON. The bug and exploit () was also leaked by The ShadowBrokers, in the same batch of exploits and backdoors. According to Ars Technica, the exploit can easily be made to work against more modern versions of Cisco ASA than what the leaked exploit can handle.

On the 29th of January 2018 a security problem at the Cisco ASA-brand was disclosed by Cedric Halbronn from the NCC Group. A use after free-bug in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The bug is listed as .

<doc id="992437" wikidata="Q7942146" url="?curid=992437" title="Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003">
<text>The Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003 (VCIAA) bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives on May 22, 2003 as by Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ) and United States Senate on December 9, 2003 as by Bob Graham (D-FL). It is designed to &quot;amend the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 to require a voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy&quot; in electronic voting systems.

==Provisions of the bill==

===Section 2===

This section titled &quot;Extension Of Time Provided For States To Request Payments Under Title 1&quot; extends the time permitted to request funds, for election administration and the replacement of old punched card voting or lever voting systems. The deadline is extended from &quot;not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of the act&quot; (which would be April 29, 2003) to &quot;not later than the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November 2003&quot; (which would be November 11, 2003).

===Section 4===

Section 4 is titled &quot;Promoting Accuracy, Integrity, And Security Through Voter-Verified Permanent Record Or Hard Copy&quot; and amends the &quot;Voting Systems Standards&quot; section of HAVA to allow voters to not only check their electronic vote but to also check the permanent paper record. 

Where HAVA requires voting systems to include a &quot;permanent paper record&quot; available as &quot;an official record&quot; for any recount that might occur and to allow voters an &quot;opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error before the permanent paper record is produced&quot;, VCIAA is specific that systems must include an &quot;individual paper record&quot; that is &quot;the official record&quot;, &quot;made available for inspection and verification by the voter at the time the vote is cast&quot; and preserved for &quot;later use in any manual recount&quot;.

This section also adds a new section to HAVA covering software and modems. This amendment requires that the software contained or used in voting systems is disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as source code and that the code can be made &quot;available for inspection upon request to any citizen&quot;.

To address security concerns, Section 4 also disallows the use of any wireless communication devices at all in voting systems.

Disabled voters are also given the option of using an &quot;interim paper system&quot; with help from an aide as well as the &quot;direct recording electronic voting system&quot; outlined by HAVA. The deadline for requesting funds for such a system is moved from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2006.

<doc id="992441" wikidata="Q2074276" url="?curid=992441" title="Powered paragliding">
<text>Powered [[paragliding]], also known as paramotoring or PPG, is a form of ultralight aviation where the pilot wears a back-pack motor (a paramotor) which provides enough thrust to take off using a paraglider. It can be launched in still air, and on level ground, by the pilot alone—no assistance is required.

==Description==
In many countries, including the United States, powered paragliding is minimally regulated and requires no license. The ability to fly both low and slow safely, the &quot;open&quot; feel, the minimal equipment and maintenance costs, and the portability are claimed to be this type of flying&#x27;s greatest merits.

Powered paragliders usually fly between at altitudes from &#x27;foot-dragging&#x27; up about to or more with certain permission.
Due to the paramotor&#x27;s slow forward speed and nature of a soft wing, it is risky to operate in high winds, turbulence, or intense thermal activity, especially for inexperienced pilots.

The paramotor, weighing from is supported by the pilot during takeoff. After a brief run (typically ) the wing lifts the motor and its harnessed pilot off the ground. After takeoff, the pilot gets into the seat and sits suspended beneath the inflated paraglider wing like a pendulum. Control is available using right and left brake toggles and a hand-held throttle control for the motor and propeller speed. Some rigs are equipped with trimmers and speed bar to adjust angle of incidence, which also changes the angle of attack for increased or reduced speed. Brake toggles and weight shift is the general method for controlling yaw and roll (turning). Tip brakes and stabilo steering (if equipped) will also affect yaw and roll, and they may be used for more efficient flying or when required by the wing manufacturer in certain wing configurations such as reflex. The throttle controls pitch (along with speed bar and trimmers). Unlike regular aircraft, increasing throttle causes a pitch-up and climb (or reduced descent) but does increase airspeed.

== Confusion with powered parachutes ==
There is often confusion about the differences between powered paragliders (PPG) and powered parachutes (PPC), both terminologically and even sometimes visually, particularly in flight.

In simple terms, PPCs always include a wheeled airframe and are often controlled using steering bars pushed on by the &quot;feet&quot; to operate the steering controls, although there are exceptions such as the Australian Aerochute and the German Xcitor. The airframe is an integral component of the aircraft (as established by FAA regulations).

PPGs, on the other hand, normally don&#x27;t have a wheeled airframe and almost exclusively steer using the &quot;hands&quot; to pull on the steering lines. When paragliding, an airframe is considered purely a higher end option; in fact, since a PPG wing is always to be attached to the harness, if the airframe used in a PPG failed in any way, the wing would continue to support the weight of the occupants and motor through the harness. In addition, because PPGs use smaller low-power engines to stay within 14 C.F.R. § 103 regulations, they frequently use a higher performance parafoil that visually appears thinner and more elliptical to compensate.

Any other distinctions are less clear. In the United States, all paragliding equipment must fall within 14 C.F.R. § 103, and pilot licensing (in the strict legal sense) is not applicable, which is not much different from ultralight PPCs. Other lines are blurred further. For example, some people previously argued that two-seat flying is only allowed using a PPC, but &quot;tandem&quot; (two-seat) paragliding is readily doable in many countries throughout the world, and limited types of tandem paragliding are legally authorized in the U.S. as a result of an FAA exemption for flight training only (since 2018, with subsequent extensions).

Another contributing reason for confusion nowadays comes from the fact that some aircraft and kit builders market ultralight-class rolling airframes that can be configured with either PPG-style hand steering or PPC-style foot steering (along with wider canopy attachment points), with the later sold as a 14 C.F.R. § 103 &#x27;powered parachute&#x27;. The net result is nearly identical aircraft, albeit with different steering systems and potentially different canopy types.

== Uses ==
Paragliders are usually used for personal recreation, with some exceptions.

=== Military ===
Powered paragliding has seen some military application including insertion of special forces soldiers and also border patrol in some governments. The Lebanese Airborne regiment adopted this technique in 2008. The US Army and Egyptian Army have used Paramotor Inc FX series units for many years, and these units are still under production. During the outset of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Hamas militants used powered paragliders to infiltrate southern Israel, several of which were used in the Re&#x27;im music festival massacre.

=== Civilian ===
Because of limiting weather requirements, powered paragliders are not reliable replacements for most aviation uses.

They have been used for search and rescue, herding of animals, photography, surveying, and other uses, but regulations in most countries limit commercial activities.

== Safety and regulations ==
Research estimates that the activity is slightly safer (fewer fatalities per thousand participants per year) than riding motorcycles and more dangerous than riding in cars. The most likely cause of serious injury is body contact with a spinning propeller. The next most likely cause of injury is flying into something other than the landing zone. Some countries run detailed statistics on accidents, e.g., in Germany in 2018 about 36,000 paragliding pilots registered 232 accidents, where 109 caused serious injury and 9 were fatal.

Some pilots carry a reserve parachute designed to open in as little as . While reserve parachutes are designed to open fast, they have a system length between 13.3 ft (4.5 m) and 21.9 ft (7.3 m) and usually need at least to slow down a pilot to a safe sink rate (certified design speed according to LTF and EN certifications is max per second). With enough height over ground, many potential issues with the canopy can be resolved without applying the reserve parachute. The required skills can be acquired in SIV trainings, which improve the overall safety of flying by providing a better understanding on the system limitations and practical training of extreme situations.

The lack of established design criteria for these aircraft led the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch to conclude in 2007 that &quot;only when precise reserve factors have been established for individual harness/wing combinations carrying realistic suspended masses, at load factors appropriate to the maneuvers to be carried out, can these aircraft be considered to be structurally safe&quot;.

=== License and training ===
Neither a license nor specific training is required in the U.S., U.K. or many other countries. Where there is no specific regulation (e.g., Mexico), paramotor flying is tolerated provided the pilots cooperate with local officials when appropriate. In countries where specific regulation exists, such as Canada, France, Italy, and South Africa, pilots must be trained, both in flying theory and practice, by licensed instructors. Some countries that require formal certification frequently do so through non-government ultralight aviation organizations.

Regardless of regulations, powered paragliding can be dangerous when practiced without proper training.

For a pilot to get through most organizations&#x27; full pilot syllabus requires between 5 and 15 days which, due to weather, may include far more calendar time. A number of techniques are employed for teaching, although most include getting the student familiar with handling the wing either on the ground, via towing, small hills, or on tandem flights.

With special gear, it is possible to take a passenger (tandem), but most countries, including the U.S., require some form of certification to do so.

=== Regulations ===
In most countries, paramotor pilots operate under simple rules that spare them certification requirements for pilot and gear. Those laws, however, limit where they can fly—specifying that pilots avoid areas of urban/suburban population and larger airports to minimize risk to other people or aircraft. U.S. pilots operate under Federal Aviation Administration regulation Part 103. As powered heavier-than-air flying vehicles with wings, paramotors are technically a type of aircraft as defined in 14 CFR 1.1 - General definitions, which defines definitions for all FARs including part 103. 

In the United Kingdom, paramotors are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, are classified as self-propelled hang-gliders, and can be flown without registration or a license as long as they weigh less than 70 kg, have a stall speed not exceeding 35 knots, and are foot-launched. Wheel-launched paramotors are allowed under the additional conditions that they do not carry passengers, and have a stall speed of 20 knots or less, but may weigh up to 75 kg if they carry a reserve parachute.

== Associations ==
In the U.S., the sport is represented primarily by the US Powered Paragliding Association (USPPA) which also holds an exemption allowing two-place training by appropriately certified tandem instructors. The US Ultralight Association (USUA) and Aero Sports Connections (ASC) also offer some support.

Instructors in the U.S. are primarily represented and certified by the United States Powered Paragliding Association (USPPA).

In the United Kingdom, the sport is represented by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.

== Powered parachute differences ==
A powered paraglider (PPG) differs from a powered parachute (PPC) primarily in size, power, control method, and number of occupants. Powered paragliders are smaller, use more efficient (but more difficult to manage) paraglider wings, and steer with brake toggles like sport parachutists. Powered parachutes typically use easier-to-manage but less efficient wings, have larger engines, are steered by foot and may be able to take along passengers. There are exceptions; a growing number of powered parachutes use elliptical wings, some use hand controls, and many are light, single-seat aircraft that meet FAA Part 103 requirements.

== World records ==
Determined by the FAI, RPF1 category.

* The current world altitude record for powered paragliders (RPF1TM) is 7,589m (24 898 ft). It was set by Ramon Morillas Salmeron (Granada, Spain) on 19 September 2009 while flying an Advance Sigma paraglider and a PAP frame powered by a HE R220Duo engine.
* A highly publicized altitude record attempt was made by Bear Grylls on 14 May 2007 at 0933 local time over the Himalayas using a Parajet engine invented by Gilo Cardozo and a specifically designed reflex paraglider wing invented by Mike Campbell-Jones of Paramania. Cardozo, who also flew in the attempt, had engine problems that ended his climb 300m short of the record. Grylls went on to claim an altitude of 8,990 m (29,494 ft), though satisfactory evidence of this claim was not submitted to FAI, and therefore it was not ratified as a world record for this aircraft class.
* Distance in a straight line without landing: set on 23 April 2007 by Ramon Morillas Salmeron flying from Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz (Spain) to Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Spain) with an Advance Omega 7 paraglider.
*Fastest Crossing of the United States of America Direct Path 2104 Miles in December 2020. Harley Milne (50xChallenge) cross the southern route from San Diego to Jacksonville Florida in 8 days 2 hours. Flying 48 hours 19 minutes, over 22 flights with a maximum 12,444 AGL and Max Speed of 89.9 MPH ground speed. 

Determined by Guinness World Records 

*The longest journey by powered paraglider is 9,132 km (5,674.35 mi) and was achieved by Miroslav Oros (Czech Republic), flying throughout the Czech Republic, starting in Sazená and ending in Lipovå-lázn, between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2011.
*2nd Longest Journey by Powered Paraglider: set on 24 August 2009 by Canadian photographer and documentary filmmaker Benjamin Jordan during his Above + Beyond Canada campaign. In an unprecedented flight between Tofino, BC and Bay Saint Lawrence, NS, the cross-Canada campaign involved 108 flights with landings at schools and youth summer camps along the way. Jordan provided youth with motivational speeches and arranged them in shapes on the ground before launching and continuing on the next leg of his journey. Funds raised over the course of the trip were donated to various charities across Canada to help children from low-income homes attend summer camp.
*First Paramotor Pilot to Fly in all 50 US States. The fastest time to fly a paramotor/ powered paraglider in all 50 US states is 215 days and was achieved by Harley Milne (USA), across USA from 8 November 2019 to 10 June 2020. While achieving this record Harley is also the first to complete this undertaking.

<text>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries in Africa are sorted according to data from the International Monetary Fund.
The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country&#x27;s currency. Such fluctuations may change a country&#x27;s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.

Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.

The 2024 estimates are as follows:

<text>After the Sunset is a 2004 American heist action comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and starring Pierce Brosnan as Max Burdett, a master thief caught in a pursuit with FBI agent Stan Lloyd, played by Woody Harrelson. It was shot in the Bahamas. The film was met with negative reviews and flopped at the box office.

==Plot==
FBI Agent Stanley P. Lloyd has been assigned to transport the second of three famous diamonds, known as the Napoleon diamonds, cautious that master thief Max Burdett will potentially steal it. His convoy is interupted by a dreadlocked squeegee man washing their windscreen, who Lloyd tips a dollar to leave. However, the man scans the car which allows Max to gain control of the vehicle, driving it to a warehouse. Max meets and embraces the squeegee man who then pulls off a mask revealing his girlfriend, Lola, in disguise. Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond, which she does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received from Lloyd earlier. Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas.

Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there.

Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. He partners up with Sophie, a local constable, to try to capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri Mooré, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett&#x27;s impressive history as a thief. So, he offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond.

Burdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with Mooré. He gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime. Lola kicks Max out after he breaks his promise to spend their first sunset on her new deck she had been working on and after she finds out he lied about writing his vows to her.

Max is forced to bunk with Lloyd, and they share their thoughts about each other&#x27;s lives. The next morning, the authorities and Sophie discover them, revealing that Lloyd&#x27;s on suspension from the FBI. They team up to win back Sophie and Lola, but Max still gives in and uses the dive trip as a distraction to steal the diamond, which works perfectly when Mooré&#x27;s man tries at the same time but is caught after the fake plan doesn&#x27;t work.

After the fallout, Lola leaves Max after Lloyd shoots Mooré dead when he comes for the diamond. Max realizes his error, writes his vows, and manages to win back Lola at the airport before she leaves, proposing to her with &quot;the first diamond he ever bought&quot;.

The next day, Max is met by Lloyd while celebrating, who reveals he set him up and let Max do all the work while he later recovered the diamond as he&#x27;d seen him preparing the hiding place for it. Max concedes that his nemesis has won this time and is simply happy to live out his life with Lola, watching sunsets with her.

As Max and Lola are enjoying themselves on the beach, Max uses a remote control on Stan&#x27;s car that has arrived at the airport, using it to mess with Stan, who quickly realizes what is going on and is unable to do anything about it. Lola asks Max if this is the &quot;last time&quot;, which he agrees to.

==Cast==

The film also features several cameos, including Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Phil Jackson, Jeff Garlin, Dyan Cannon, Edward Norton, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal as themselves.

==Production==
Paul Zbyszewski&#x27;s original screenplay for &quot;After the Sunset&quot; was discovered by producers Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson, both known for producing movies such as &quot;Tigerland&quot; (2000) and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000). The script was purchased by New Line Cinema, and the producers hired Australian screenwriter Craig Rosenberg to create a re-write. Both the studio and the producers agreed that their first choice for the role of master thief Max Burdett was Pierce Brosnan. Salma Hayek, Oscar-nominated for her role in &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), was the next actor to join the cast.

Next to join the cast was director Brett Ratner. The film had originally been scheduled to be directed by John Stockwell but dropped out due to creative differences. Talking about joining the movie, Ratner said: &quot;I love caper films. There are so many great films in this genre, but what makes &quot;After the Sunset&quot; different is that it&#x27;s a heist movie that has a combination of great relationships, heart, and comedy.&quot;

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan were both offered film cameos as police officers (a nod to the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; series which Brett Ratner also directed) but turned them down.

With the two leads set, Woody Harrelson was cast in the role of Burdett&#x27;s nemesis, FBI agent Stanley Lloyd. Harrelson said during promotion: &quot;When this movie came along, I loved it right away.&quot; Don Cheadle&#x27;s casting marked a third collaboration with Ratner, following &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000) and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001). The role of Sophie, the Bahamian cop, was the next role to be cast. British actress Naomie Harris landed the role.

With the majority of the script set on an island in the Caribbean, the filmmakers decided to shoot in The Bahamas, based out of the Atlantis resort in Nassau.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened at number 3 in North America, earning $11,100,392 in its opening weekend, with its widest release in 2,819 theaters. It grossed $28,331,233 domestically and $33,016,564 in international markets, adding up to a worldwide gross of $61,347,797.

===Critical response===
&quot;After the Sunset&quot; received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating, based on reviews, with an average score of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A slick but bland thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Ty Burr from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; saw the film&#x27;s potential as a &quot;decent heist flick&quot; during the opening robbery scene but felt it devolves into a plotless drag involving sightseeing and female-ogling in the Bahamas. Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; gave note of Zbyszewski and Rosenberg&#x27;s script feeling barebones within its given genre and moving &quot;unsteadily between crime drama and romantic farce&quot;, and Ratner&#x27;s direction matching it in terms of tonal whiplash and coming across like a &quot;tourist infomercial,&quot; calling it &quot;one of the most lackadaisical Hollywood projects of the year.&quot; Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; criticized Ratner and Zbyszewski for making a &quot;pale revision&quot; of Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Heat&quot; that sidesteps both the heist and interesting characters for more macho posturing and homophobic humor between its two male leads.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B− grade, calling it &quot;a knowingly preposterous toy thriller--a sheer escape from consequence.&quot; Roger Ebert pointed out the numerous plot machinations and &quot;behavior-circling clichés&quot; amongst the characters throughout the film but gave it credit for accomplishing the type of entertainment it aims to be, despite there being better movie choices for film-goers to check out, saying that &quot;&quot;After the Sunset&quot; is skillfully made, but it&#x27;s not necessary […] On the other hand, should you see it, the time will pass pleasantly.&quot; James Berardinelli found the film to be &quot;a mess, but [it&#x27;s] a fun, breezy mess&quot;, criticizing the overall heist and weak characterization but gave praise to the quick pacing, three-way chemistry between Brosnan, Hayek and Harrelson, and Dante Spinotti&#x27;s cinematography for capturing the &quot;natural beauty&quot; of its Caribbean setting, saying &quot;despite not being especially well-written, it nevertheless offers a 100-minute, unpretentious diversion.&quot;

<doc id="992455" wikidata="Q644297" url="?curid=992455" title="Gothic (film)">
<text>Gothic is a 1986 British psychological horror film directed by Ken Russell, starring Gabriel Byrne as Lord Byron, Julian Sands as Percy Bysshe Shelley, Natasha Richardson as Mary Shelley, Myriam Cyr as Claire Clairmont (Mary Shelley&#x27;s stepsister) and Timothy Spall as Dr. John William Polidori. It features a soundtrack by Thomas Dolby, and marks Richardson&#x27;s and Cyr&#x27;s film debut.

The film is a fictionalized retelling of the Shelleys&#x27; visit to Lord Byron in Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva, shot in Gaddesden Place. It concerns their competition to write a horror story, which ultimately led to Mary Shelley writing &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and John Polidori writing &quot;The Vampyre.&quot; The same event has also been portrayed in the films &quot;Mary Shelley&quot; (with Elle Fanning as Mary Shelley), &quot;Haunted Summer&quot; (1988) (with Alice Krige as Mary Shelley) among others, and alluded to in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) (with Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley and the Bride of the Monster).

The film&#x27;s poster motif is based on Henry Fuseli&#x27;s 1781 painting &quot;The Nightmare&quot;, which is also referenced in the film.

==Plot== 
Through her stepsister Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin and her future husband Percy Shelley come to know Lord Byron. During the summer of 1816, Lord Byron invites them to stay for a while at Villa Diodati in Switzerland. There they meet Byron&#x27;s physician friend, Dr. John Polidori. On 16 June, while a storm rages outside, the five of them amuse themselves by engaging in a game of hide-and-seek. Later in a parlor, Percy proclaims his fascination with science; Polidori tells him of his interests in sleepwalking and nightmares. Lord Byron shows his guests &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, a book of horror stories he purchased from a shop in Geneva, and the three alternately read excerpts. This inspires them to hold a séance gathered around a human skull, during which Claire has an apparent seizure. Mary describes them as Claire&#x27;s &quot;horrors,&quot; and recalls instances during their childhood when unexplained phenomena would occur during them, such as Claire&#x27;s bed inexplicably shaking, and doors slamming shut by themselves. Polidori brings Claire upstairs to rest.

During the night, Mary witnesses a shadowy apparition outside the window she and Claire share. Believing Mary was startled by a slamming barn door outside, Percy goes to shut it. While investigating the barn, he is startled by a grotesque creature. Mary speaks with Lord Byron in the billiard room, confronting him about his intentions with Claire, and reveals to him that Claire is pregnant with his child. He suggests she have an abortion, and the two argue, resulting in a physical confrontation.

Later, Lord Byron performs oral sex on Claire, during which she has a miscarriage. Meanwhile, Mary consoles Percy, who has grown increasingly paranoid and claims to smell an overpowering scent of decay. From the bottom of the staircase, Mary hears a noise, and feels liquid dripping on her. As she looks up, she sees Polidori leaning over the banister, clutching a bleeding wound on his neck. Once the bleeding is controlled, he claims to have been bitten by a vampire in his room. Byron accuses him of self-inflicting the wounds, while Percy and Mary believe him. Percy raves that the group collectively gave birth to something during the séance, manifesting their worst fears, while Polidori is scared of damnation for his homosexuality. He attempts to poison himself to death with cyanide, but is stopped by Byron.

Claire goes missing from her bedroom, and is discovered by Percy; he watches in horror as her breasts metamorphose into eyes; Mary attempts to flee the house, and inadvertently crashes through a glass door. Percy infers that the presence haunting them is feeding off of the group&#x27;s fear. During a failed attempt to hang himself in the barn, Polidori witnesses a figure flee on horseback. Percy and Byron attempt to recreate the séance to banish their creation. Byron and Percy, both atheists, believe it must be returned to the recesses of their minds, while Mary questions the metaphysical and supernatural events plaguing them.

In the basement, the three discover Claire nude and covered in mud. Byron attempts to hold the séance there, but Mary refuses. During the event, Mary crushes the skull, and attempts to stab Byron with a shard. Percy stops her, and begins kissing Byron passionately. As she flees through the home, Mary witnesses an apparition of her son, William, in a coffin, followed by a vision of her suffering a miscarriage. In the madness, she attempts to throw herself off a balcony, but is stopped by Percy. Mary awakens the following morning and joins Byron, Percy, and Claire in the garden.

In the contemporary era, tourists visit the Villa. A voice-over informs that Mary&#x27;s son, William, died three years after that night in June 1816, followed by Percy&#x27;s drowning in 1822; Byron would die two years after Percy, and Polidori committed suicide in London. From Mary&#x27;s previous experience of miscarriage came the desire to raise her child from the dead, which led to her writing &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. From Polidori&#x27;s homosexuality, suicidal thoughts, and fascination with vampires came the story &quot;The Vampyre.&quot;

==Basis in reality==

The film fictionalizes an actual meeting that took place between Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and Claire Clairemont at the Villa Diodati in Geneva, hosted by Lord Byron. It has been suggested by some historians and journalists that the events of their meeting which inspired Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; were triggered by the group&#x27;s use of opium during their vacation together. Discussing the film&#x27;s basis in reality, actor Sands commented:

The film implies that Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was inspired by the loss of her child; film historian Robert Shail wrote that &quot;Gothic&quot;″s &quot;baroque visuals can&#x27;t disguise the dubious nature of Russell&#x27;s premise that the book was inspired by the author&#x27;s loss of a baby.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
The film was based on a screenplay by Stephen Volk, who worked in advertising. He sent it to Al Clark, head of Virgin Films. Clark said &quot;it was worlds removed from the scripts that one predominantly gets in this country, with their literary ambience and dependence on a sort of linguistic authenticity. I felt it offered a perfect springboard to a director.&quot;

After seeing &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, Clark offered the film to Ken Russell, who then accepted. Volk admits to having &quot;slight misgivings&quot; when Clark mentioned Russell&#x27;s name, &quot;But when I met Ken, I found, somehow to my surprise, that he was very easy to get on with&quot;. Russell worked on a further draft of the script with Volk which made relatively minor changes.

Russell had been interested in Byron and Shelley&#x27;s meeting for a decade. He said, &quot;About 10 years ago, Robert Powell, the actor, approached me with a script covering the same time span and events. But we couldn&#x27;t raise the money. I think it was a little too poetic and not as scary as it might have been.&quot; Russell saw &quot;Gothic&quot; as &quot;a sort of black comedy; some of the others have been slightly more serious. This has deliberate comic overtones, sort of a satire.&quot;

&quot;I felt pretty positive about the story when it was sent to me,&quot; said Russell. &quot;It was extremely visual, which attracted me. And the use of laudanum gave me a springboard for my ideas.&quot;

&quot;I made the film because I was offered a script,&quot; Russell later said. &quot;Everything&#x27;s there (in the film). They (the main characters) were responsible for publicizing the gothic experience. It&#x27;s a watershed: From that meeting, everything seemed to go against them.&quot;

The film was announced in December 1985. Ken Russell had planned to make a version of &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; but that fell through. The film was a co production between America&#x27;s Atlantic Entertainment Group and Britain&#x27;s Virgin Films. The budget was around two million pounds.

===Filming===
Filming started in June 1986 and wound up in August. It took place at Hertfordshire, mostly in and around the Palladian mansion Wrotham Park, with a week&#x27;s shooting in the Lake&#x27;s District.

Julian Sands had recently made &quot;A Room with a View&quot; with James Ivory and compared that director with Russell saying, &quot;If James Ivory had done a film about Shelley, it would be a much more lyrical and soothing piece of work, whereas Ken&#x27;s treatment is much more symphonic and mesmerizing. With James Ivory you are on a carousel, but with Ken Russell you are on a roller coaster. James Ivory is like an Indian miniaturist, and Ken Russell is a graffiti artist. James Ivory is like an ornithologist watching his subjects with a pair of binoculars from afar, whereas Ken Russell is a big-game hunter filming in the middle of a rhino charge.&quot;

Natasha Richardson found shooting difficult. &quot;I myself was sort of shattered by the end. It became difficult to turn off and turn on. We&#x27;d get to the umpteenth take, and I just couldn&#x27;t stop crying between takes.&quot;

The film&#x27;s music score was written and recorded by the English new wave and synth-pop musician Thomas Dolby. &quot;It was my first attempt to write orchestral music,&quot; Dolby said. &quot;Ken was great to work with - he gave me lots of freedom. In fact, he just wanted everything louder!&quot; 

Dolby&#x27;s score was released as the soundtrack album &quot;Music from the film Gothic&quot; in 1987. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;The Devil is an Englishman&quot;, was released as a single; credited to &quot;Screamin&#x27; Lord Byron,&quot; the song features Timothy Spall reciting lyrics over Dolby&#x27;s music and also includes vocal samples from &quot;Gothic&quot;.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere at the London Film Festival.

The film was released in the United States by Vestron Pictures.

===Marketing===
The film received several theatrical posters as part of its promotional campaign; the original 1986 Virgin Films poster is an excerpt from Henry Fuseli&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare&quot; (1781), which is also depicted in the film. A second poster, based on the Fuseli painting, features Natasha Richardson lying over a bed with a goblin-like creature perched on her chest (an image which is also depicted in the film).

The poster artwork was deemed controversial at the time of the film&#x27; release, as noted by Derek Malcom, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

===Box office===
&quot;Gothic&quot; premiered at the 30th BFI London Film Festival on 30 November 1986.

It received a limited theatrical release in the United States on 10 April 1987, grossing $32,061 on its opening weekend; it went on to gross a total of $916,172.

However, according to Dan Ireland, who later worked with Russell, the film was a financial success on video. Vestron, the company who distributed the film on video, signed Russell to a three-picture contract which ensured him financing for the rest of the decade. Russell said the film gave his career a &quot;second wind&quot; after he thought &quot;he had had it.&quot;

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.0/10.

For the film&#x27;s U.S. release, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t always coherent, but it&#x27;s as ghoulishly funny and frenzied as a carnival ride through The Marquis de Sade&#x27;s Tunnel of Love,&quot; adding: &quot;Don&#x27;t go to &quot;Gothic&quot; expecting to be elevated. This is no reverie. It&#x27;s a series of gaudy shock effects, an anthology of horror-film mannerisms that looks like a 60&#x27;s LSD trip. If &quot;Gothic&quot; says anything about Byron, Shelley and their friends, it&#x27;s just that anyone who trusted them with a summer rental had to be out of his mind.&quot; Desson Howe from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Beyond the carnalia... &quot;Gothic&quot; happens to be strikingly shot, the special effects inspired, albeit gruesome. Although he slops his signature blood &#x27;n&#x27; cleavage across the screen, Russell makes it slick, with dynamic cutting, vivid lighting and framing. Who knows, you might spot a little humor in this hyperbolic lunacy. On the other hand, after a cinematic orgy like this, you might long for 15 minutes with an evangelist.&quot; Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2/4 stars, writing, &quot;Too weird for some, too highbrow for many horror fans, but full of Russel&#x27;s hallucinatory visuals.&quot;

On his website &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot;, Dennis Schwartz graded the film a C+, criticizing the film&#x27;s overwhelming silliness, dialogue, and tacky moments. Schwartz concluded his review by writing, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, thank you, but no thank you, I&#x27;ll take my Byron and Shelley straight.&quot; In his book &quot;The A–Z of Horror Films&quot;, Howard Maxford called the film &quot;A relentlessly hysterical barrage of images in its director&#x27;s most deplorable manner. Laughable when it isn&#x27;t sickening.&quot;

Harlan Ellison praised the film saying:
&quot;Gothic&quot; is loopy and fatally flawed and an aberration. Yet I treasure this film. So may you. If you, as am I, are out of your head... you will cleave to this tortured bit of cinematic epilepsy because it is ALIVE. It is yet another crime of passion committed by Ken Russell, and his sort of berserk creativity has fallen on such hard times in this age of Reagan and yuppie sensibility, that simply to be exposed to the ravings of an inspired madman is cathartic. I came away from GOTHIC with my soul on fire... The final assertion of critical judgement on GOTHIC is not whether or not it is good, or whether one likes it or not. The undeniable truth of GOTHIC, as in all the work of Ken Russell (an artist who is either so mad or so foolhardy as not to care if he wins or loses), is that it is palpably ALIVE. It is riot and ruin and pandemonium. But it will have you by the nerve-ends.

===Accolades===

<text>The Aero A.104 was a parasol monoplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft built in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was the final derivative of the [[Aero A.100]], and was essentially an [[Aero Ab.101]] with an enclosed cockpit and without the lower wing. Although two different prototypes flew in 1937, it was not mass-produced.

<text>The Saqqaq culture (named after the Saqqaq settlement, the site of many archaeological finds) was a Paleo-Eskimo culture in southern Greenland. Up to this day, no other people seem to have lived in Greenland continually for as long as the Saqqaq.

==Timeframe==
The earliest known archaeological culture in southern Greenland, the Saqqaq existed from around 2500 BCE until about 800 BCE. This culture coexisted with the Independence I culture of northern Greenland, which developed around 2400 BCE and lasted until about 1300 BCE. After the Saqqaq culture disappeared, the Independence II culture of northern Greenland and the Early Dorset culture of West Greenland emerged. There is some debate about the timeframe of the transition from Saqqaq culture to Early Dorset in western Greenland.

The Saqqaq culture came in two phases, the main difference of the two being that the newer phase adopted the use of sandstone. The younger phase of the Saqqaq culture coincides with the oldest phase of the Dorset culture.

==Archaeological findings==
Frozen remains of a Saqqaq person dubbed &quot;Inuk&quot; were found in western Greenland (Qeqertarsuaq) and have been DNA sequenced. He had brown eyes, black hair, and shovel-shaped teeth. It has been determined that he lived about 4000 years ago, and was related to native populations in northeastern Siberia. The Saqqaq people are not the ancestors of contemporary Kalaallit people, but instead are related to modern Chukchi and Koryak peoples. It is not known whether they crossed in boats or over ice.

Saqqaq people lived in small tents and hunted seals, seabirds, and other marine animals.
The people of the Saqqaq culture used silicified slate, agate, quartzite, and rock crystals as materials for their tools.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in August 2014 examined the remains of six Saqqaq individuals buried in Qeqertasussuk, Greenland between ca. 3000 BCE and 1900 BCE. The five samples of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted belonged to haplogroups D2a1 (four samples) and D2a. These haplogroups also predominate in the Dorset culture, and are today found in high frequencies among Siberian Yupik and Aleut, with whom the Saqqaq are relatively closely related. The evidence suggested that the ancestors of the Saqqaq entered North America from Siberia through a distinct migration about 4000 BC, and that they subsequently remained largely genetically isolated from other North American populations.

<doc id="992494" wikidata="Q5544179" url="?curid=992494" title="George S. Mercouris">
<text>George S. Mercouris (; 1886 – December 1943) was a Greek politician who served as a Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister, and later founded the Greek National Socialist Party; a minor fascist party, they were one of several small far right parties in Greece at the time. During the occupation of Greece, Mercouris was appointed by the Nazis as Governor of the National Bank of Greece.

==Biography==
Mercouris was born in Athens into a prominent political family, the son of Spyridon Mercouris, long-serving Mayor of Athens, and the brother of Stamatis Mercouris, who would end up becoming a politician of the Left. He studied law and political science in the University of Athens, as well as in Paris. For his first political appointment he was elected as Member of Parliament in 1915 and he served until 1929. 

In summer 1917 was exiled by the French and Venizelists to Corsica from he returned after the end of WWI and the antivenizelist electoral win. He was Minister for Food and Supply in the Petros Protopapadakis cabinet from May until August 1922. He then became Minister of National Economy in the Alexandros Zaimis cabinet from December 1926 until August 1927. He also served as the Greek delegate to the League of Nations in 1927.

Mercouris was re-elected to parliament, in September 1932, and made vice-president of the People&#x27;s Party which he left in November after a disagreement with its leader Panagis Tsaldaris. In December he founded the Greek National Socialist Party. Mercouris represented the party at the Fascist International meeting, in Montreux on December 16/17 of 1934. He was among the more germanophilic adherents of the largely Italian fascism oriented authoritarian, corporatist, and anti-communist movement. He acted as an intermediary between Greece and Nazi Germany. Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis (during the Axis occupation) appointed him Governor of the National Bank of Greece in 1943.

==Personal life==
He died of a heart attack during World War II. His brother Stamatis was later an MP for the United Democratic Left, and his niece was the famous actress, singer, and politician Melina Mercouri. Because of his political views, they refused to attend his funeral.

<text>Mary Kostakidis (born 1954) is an Australian journalist and political commentator. She is the former prime time weeknight &quot;SBS World News Australia&quot; presenter and was the face of SBS over two decades.
Her journalism spans geopolitical issues, democracy and press freedom. Her commentary covers areas including the Middle East, national security, AUKUS, China and the failings of mainstream media. Her work is published by independent media including public policy journal Pearls and Irritations and has used Twitter/X extensively to contemporaneously report court proceedings in great detail, including the four week UK evidentiary Extradition hearing of Julian Assange and subsequent appeals.

==Early life==
She was born in Veria, Greece, and her family migrated to Australia two years later. Kostakidis attended Fort Street Girls&#x27; High School, and the University of Sydney, where she studied Modern Greek, philosophy, French, German and Italian. She was a founding member and first president of the university&#x27;s Greek Society SUGS. She completed a Diploma of Education. Kostakidis was awarded a post-graduate scholarship to study at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

Before joining SBS, Kostakidis worked as a tutor at the University of Sydney, as a research officer for the Departments of Health and Youth and Community Services in New South Wales and as a court interpreter and a translations editor. She has also hosted programmes on ABC Radio stations 2BL and Classic FM.

During her assignment as an interpreter on the so-called &quot;Greek Conspiracy Case&quot; in the late 1970s, she organised a conversion course for Greek interpreters at the NSW Ethnic Affairs Commission in conjunction with Sydney University&#x27;s Modern Greek Department, to facilitate a conversion from the formal Katharevousa to demotic or vernacular Greek so that the defendants in the case would be able to understand the language being used. Some years later, Greece also adopted the vernacular as the language of all official documents.

==Acting==

Kostakidis acted in a children&#x27;s television series called &quot;Five Times Dizzy&quot; in 1986 with Rebekah Elmaloglou. She has also appeared in the movies &quot;Jindabyne&quot; and &quot;Look Both Ways&quot; as a newsreader.

==Career==

Kostakidis was a member of the management team that set up and developed SBS Television in 1980 and presented its flagship World News for 20 years, resigning in 2007. Her board and committee appointments during nearly 3 decades at SBS and subsequently reflect a strong commitment to social justice and the arts.

She has served as a member of the Fred Hollows Foundation Board, the Sydney Theatre Board, the National Library of Australia Council, the ResMed Foundation Board, the Advisory Panel of the Sydney Peace Foundation, University of Sydney, the ANU&#x27;s Freilich Foundation, and The Privacy Foundation. She is a former Chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation.

In 2009, Kostakidis was appointed by the Rudd government to the National Human Rights Consultation Committee chaired by Frank Brennan. The Committee inquired into the adequacy of the protection and promotion of human rights in Australia, holding consultations in metropolitan, rural and remote areas across the country, and receiving over 35,000 written submissions. The Committee recommended a raft of measures, the most contentious of which was a Human Rights Act. Human rights education was the measure that had the greatest support of those that took part in the consultation, but an overwhelming majority supported human rights legislation. The four member Committee also included Mick Palmer and Tammy Williams.

From 1997 to 2003, she served on the Advertising Standards Board; in 1993 she was appointed by then Prime Minister Paul Keating to Republic Advisory Committee chaired by Malcolm Turnbull; in the early nineties she also served on the Council for the Order of Australia and in 1992 was a founding member of the James Joyce Foundation Board along with Ed Campion and Don Anderson. She has also been an active member of the Kazantzaki society.

Kostakidis has served as an Ambassador for Beyond Blue and was also a member of the Drug and Alcohol Council, the Breast Cancer Council and Advisory Committee and the Constitutional Centenary Foundation.

In 1989, Kostakidis hosted the Ethnic Business Awards, which highlighted migrant and Indigenous excellence in business. She went on to host the awards again from 1991 to 1994 as well as from 1996 to 1997.

==SBS==
===The &quot;Face of SBS&quot;===
Kostakidis joined SBS as part of the original management team in September 1980 and worked on the development of the Subtitling Unit, its policy, recruitment and training programme. She went on to become Director of Programme Preparation overseeing Subtitling, Censorship and Classification, and a Post Production Unit. In this role she was responsible for the development of censorship and classification and children&#x27;s programming policies.

Kostakidis moved from Management to anchor SBS&#x27;s flagship evening news in 1988 after presenting the weekend bulletin for 18 months. 

In 1994, she hosted the prime time interview program, &quot;The Talk Show&quot;. Her guests included Paul Keating, John Laws, Cheryl Kernot, Imran Khan, Betty Friedan and Don Dunstan.

After being known as &quot;the face of SBS News&quot; for many years, in her final year she co-hosted the main SBS World News at weekdays with Stan Grant.

===Walk-out and legal action===
In August 2007, Kostakidis walked out of the SBS newsroom over changes she believed undermined SBS standards and over what she claimed was a breach of contract. According to authors Ien Ang, Gay Hawkins and Lamia Dabboussy, Kostakidis was unhappy with &quot;the introduction of advertisements within [news] programs,&quot; and her departure &quot;was clearly a big blow to SBS, and signalled for many that the multicultural broadcaster had lost its way.&quot;

On 5 October 2007, Kostakidis lodged a statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging a breach of contract and contravention of the &quot;Trade Practices Act 1975&quot; on the part of SBS. She alleged that she had been bullied by fellow presenter Stan Grant and had been &quot;intimidated and bullied&quot; by SBS managing director Shaun Brown, who was driving change at SBS he believed would result in a wider audience reach and increased revenue. She was represented in court by prominent Melbourne lawyer, Julian Burnside.

The matter was settled out of court. On 23 November 2007, SBS and Kostakidis were reported to have reached an &quot;amicable settlement&quot;. The financial details of the settlement were not disclosed.

==Activism==
Kostakidis has a long-standing interest in social justice and continues to engage in public discourse, delivering lectures, chairing public forums and contributing editorial opinion articles in the mainstream press and independent online media. 

===Julian Assange===
Kostakidis has supported Julian Assange. In 2011, she presented Assange with the Sydney Peace Foundation&#x27;s Gold Medal for peace with justice. She described WikiLeaks as an &quot;ingenious website that has shifted the power balance between citizen and the state by exposing what governments really get up to in our name&quot;. She said the treatment of Assange by the US was intended to &quot;shut down WikiLeaks and criminalise the activity of this publisher&quot;. She has criticised Assange&#x27;s extradition trial in the UK and the media for a lack of interest in the case.

===Israel and Palestine conflict===
In July 2024, the Zionist Federation of Australia said it would lodge a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission alleging that Kostakidis breached racial discrimination laws by posting on X a link to a speech by Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah. Kostakidis said &quot;The point of that tweet was to say that Israel is inviting an escalation, it’s inviting retribution because it is conducting a genocide&quot;.

==Personal life==
Her second husband is Professor Ian Wilcox, a cardiologist.

<text>Dragondrums is a young adult science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. Published by Atheneum Books in 1979, it was the sixth to appear in the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series by Anne or her son Todd McCaffrey.

&quot;Dragondrums&quot; completed the &quot;Harper Hall of Pern&quot; trilogy one year after &quot;The White Dragon&quot; completed the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; trilogy. Boxed and omnibus editions of both trilogies soon followed.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Dragondrums&quot; is the coming of age story of Piemur, a small, quick, clever apprentice at Harper Hall. When Piemur&#x27;s clear treble voice changes, his place among the Harpers is no longer certain. He is sent to the drum towers to learn drumming, the primary method of long-distance communication on Pern for non-dragonriders, while his voice settles. There he has to deal with the jealousy and bullying of the other drumming apprentices. When Masterharper Robinton secretly asks Piemur to be his apprentice, Piemur begins journeying through Pern, gathering information and running discreet errands for the Masterharper. In his adventures throughout Pern, Piemur has only his knowledge and wits to deal with a cruel Lord Holder and rogue dragonriders. He Impresses one of the coveted fire-lizards – a gold he names Farli – as a companion, discovers his place in the world, and earns journeyman status among the Harpers.

The events in &quot;Dragondrums&quot; take place after &quot;Dragonsinger&quot; and are contiguous with some events in &quot;The White Dragon&quot;, which discusses characters and events elsewhere on Pern.

==Awards==
The American Library Association in 1999 cited these first six Pern books, along with &quot;The Ship Who Sang&quot;, when McCaffrey received the annual Margaret A. Edwards Award for her &quot;lifetime contribution in writing for teens&quot;.

&quot;Dragondrums&quot; placed eighth for the annual Locus Award for Best Novel and it won the annual Balrog Award in the Novel class.

<text>The Aero A.200 was a sportsplane of Czechoslovakia, designed and built specifically to compete in Challenge 1934, the European touring plane championships. It was a four-seater low-wing monoplane.

==Operational service==
Flown in competition by Ján Ambruš, the A.200 took fourth place, beaten by the RWD-9 (that took both first and second places for Poland) and the Fieseler Fi 97 (from Germany). The other A.200, flown by Vojtěch Žaček, took the 14th place for 34 competitors. They carried registrations OK-AMA and OK-AMB.

In a technical evaluation, A.200s scored the 4th result from among aircraft types taking part in the Challenge. They had the best short take-off capabilities in the contest – A.200s needed 74.5-77.6 m to take off and fly over 8-m high gate, although they needed some 118 m to land from above the gate.

==Description==
Mixed construction low-wing monoplane, braced with wire. Fuselage of a steel frame, covered with wood and canvas, elliptical in cross-section. Rectangular wings of wooden construction, canvas covered, fitted with all-span slats and with flaps. Wings were folding rearwards. Cab had two seats side by side in front, with twin controls, and two seats in the rear, under a common multi-part canopy. Fixed landing gear with a rear skid. Radial engine in fuselage nose, with NACA cowling. Two-blade propeller.

<text>Infographics (a clipped compound of &quot;information&quot; and &quot;graphics&quot;) are graphic visual representations of information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly. They can improve cognition by using graphics to enhance the human visual system&#x27;s ability to see patterns and trends. Similar pursuits are information visualization, data visualization, statistical graphics, information design, or information architecture. Infographics have evolved in recent years to be for mass communication, and thus are designed with fewer assumptions about the readers&#x27; knowledge base than other types of visualizations. Isotypes are an early example of infographics conveying information quickly and easily to the masses.

== Overview ==
Infographics have been around for many years and recently the increase of the number of easy-to-use, free tools have made the creation of infographics available to a large segment of the population. Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter have also allowed for individual infographics to be spread among many people around the world. Infographics are widely used in the age of short attention span.

In newspapers, infographics are commonly used to show the weather, as well as maps, site plans, and graphs for summaries of data. Some books are almost entirely made up of information graphics, such as David Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;The Way Things Work&quot;. The Snapshots in &quot;USA Today&quot; are also an example of simple infographics used to convey news and current events.

Modern maps, especially route maps for transit systems, use infographic techniques to integrate a variety of information, such as the conceptual layout of the transit network, transfer points, and local landmarks. Public transportation maps, such as those for the Washington Metro and the London Underground map, are well-known infographics. Public places such as transit terminals usually have some sort of integrated &quot;signage system&quot; with standardized icons and stylized maps.

In his 1983 &quot;landmark book&quot; &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;, Edward Tufte defines &quot;graphical displays&quot; in the following passage:

== History ==
=== Early history ===

In 1626, Christoph Scheiner published the &quot;Rosa Ursina sive Sol&quot;, a book that revealed his research about the rotation of the sun. Infographics appeared in the form of illustrations demonstrating the Sun&#x27;s rotation patterns.

In 1786, William Playfair, an engineer and political economist, published the first data graphs in his book &quot;The Commercial and Political Atlas&quot;. To represent the economy of 18th century England, Playfair used statistical graphs, bar charts, line graphs, area charts, and histograms. In his work, &quot;Statistical Breviary&quot;, he is credited with introducing the first pie chart.

Around 1820, modern geography was established by Carl Ritter. His maps included shared frames, agreed map legends, scales, repeatability, and fidelity. Such a map can be considered a &quot;supersign&quot; which combines sign systems—as defined by Charles Sanders Peirce—consisting of symbols, icons, indexes as representations. Other examples can be seen in the works of geographers Ritter and Alexander von Humboldt.
In 1857, English nurse Florence Nightingale used information graphics to persuade Queen Victoria to improve conditions in military hospitals. The principal one she used was the Coxcomb chart, a combination of stacked bar and pie charts, depicting the number and causes of deaths during each month of the Crimean War.
1861 saw the release of an influential information graphic on the subject of Napoleon&#x27;s disastrous march on Moscow. The graphic&#x27;s creator, Charles Joseph Minard, captured four different changing variables that contributed to Napoleon&#x27;s downfall in a single two-dimensional image: the army&#x27;s direction as they traveled, the location the troops passed through, the size of the army as troops died from hunger and wounds, and the freezing temperatures they experienced.

James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term &quot;graph&quot; in 1878 in the scientific magazine &quot;Nature&quot; and published a set of diagrams showing the relationship between chemical bonds and mathematical properties. These were also some of the first mathematical graphs.

=== 20th century ===
In 1900, the African-American historian, sociologist, writer, and Black rights activist, W.E.B. Du Bois presented data visualizations at the in Paris, France. In addition to curating 500 photographs of the lives of Black Americans, Du Bois and his Atlanta University team of students and scholars created 60 handmade data visualizations to document the ways Black Americans were being denied access to education, housing, employment, and household wealth.

The Cologne Progressives developed an aesthetic approach to art that focused on communicating information. Gerd Arntz, Peter Alma and Augustin Tschinkel, all participants in this movement were recruited by Otto Neurath for the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum, where they developed the Vienna Method from 1926 to 1934. Here simple images were used to represent data in a structured way. Following the victory of Austrofascism in the Austrian Civil War, the team moved to the Netherlands where they continued their work rebranding it Isotypes (International System of Typographic Picture Education). The method was also applied by IZOSTAT (ИЗОСТАТ) in the Soviet Union.

In 1942 Isidore Isou published the Lettrist manifesto, a document covering art, culture, poetry, film, and political theory. The included works also called metagraphics and hypergraphics, are a synthesis of writing and visual art.

In 1958 Stephen Toulmin proposed a graphical argument model, called The Toulmin Model of Argumentation. The diagram contained six interrelated components used for analyzing arguments and was considered Toulmin&#x27;s most influential work, particularly in the field of rhetoric, communication, and computer science. The Toulmin Model of Argumentation became influential in argumentation theory and its applications.

In 1972 and 1973, respectively, the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft included on their vessels the Pioneer Plaques, a pair of gold-anodized aluminum plaques, each featuring a pictorial message. The pictorial messages included nude male and female figures as well as symbols that were intended to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft. The images were designed by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake and were unique in that their graphical meanings were to be understandable to extraterrestrial beings, who would have no conception of human language.

A pioneer in data visualization, Edward Tufte, wrote a series of books – &quot;Visual Explanations&quot;, &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;, and &quot;Envisioning Information&quot; – on the subject of information graphics. Referred to by The New York Times as the &quot;da Vinci of Data&quot;, Tufte began to give day-long lectures and workshops on the subject of infographics starting in 1993. , Tufte still gives these lectures. To Tufte, good data visualizations represent every data point accurately and enable a viewer to see trends and patterns in the data. Tufte&#x27;s contribution to the field of data visualization and infographics is considered immense, and his design principles can be seen in many websites, magazines, and newspapers today.

The infographics created by Peter Sullivan for The Sunday Times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were some of the key factors in encouraging newspapers to use more infographics. Sullivan is also one of the few authors who have written about information graphics in newspapers. Likewise, the staff artists at USA Today, the United States newspaper that debuted in 1982, established the goal of using graphics to make information easier to comprehend. However, the paper has received criticism for oversimplifying news stories and for creating infographics that some find emphasizes entertainment over content and data. Tufte coined the term chartjunk to refer to graphics that are visually appealing to the point of losing the information contained within them.

With vector graphics and raster graphics becoming ubiquitous in computing in the 21st century, data visualizations have been applied to commonly used computer systems, including desktop publishing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Closely related to the field of information graphics is information design, which is the creation of infographics.

=== 21st century ===

By the year 2000, Adobe Flash-based animations on the Internet had made use of many key practices in creating infographics in order to create a variety of products and games.

Likewise, television began to incorporate infographics into the viewers&#x27; experiences in the early 2000s. One example of infographics usage in television and in pop culture is the 2002 music video by the Norwegian musicians of Röyksopp, for their song &quot;Remind Me.&quot; The video was composed entirely of animated infographics. Similarly, in 2004, a television commercial for the French nuclear technology company Areva used animated infographics as an advertising tactic. Both of these videos and the attention they received have conveyed to other fields the potential value of using information graphics to describe complex information efficiently.

With the rise of alternatives to Adobe Flash, such as HTML 5 and CSS3, infographics are now created in a variety of media with a number of software tools.

The field of journalism has also incorporated and applied information graphics to news stories. For stories that intend to include text, images, and graphics, the system called the maestro concept allows entire newsrooms to collaborate and organize a story to successfully incorporate all components. Across many newsrooms, this teamwork-integrated system is applied to improve time management. The maestro system is designed to improve the presentation of stories for busy readers of media. Many news-based websites have also used interactive information graphics in which the user can extract information on a subject as they explore the graphic.

Many businesses use infographics as a medium for communicating with and attracting potential customers. Information graphics are a form of content marketing and have become a tool for internet marketers and companies to create content that others will link to, thus possibly boosting a company&#x27;s reputation and online presence.

Religious denominations have also started using infographics. For example, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made numerous infographics to help people learn about their faith, missionaries, temples, lay ministry, and family history efforts.

Infographics are finding a home in the classroom as well. Courses that teach students to create their own infographics using a variety of tools may encourage engagement in the classroom and may lead to a better understanding of the concepts they are mapping onto the graphics.

With the popularity of social media, infographics have become popular, often as static images or simple web interfaces, covering any number of topics. Such infographics are often shared between users of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+ and Reddit. The hashtag #infographic was tweeted 56,765 times in March 2012 and at its peak 3,365 times in a span of 24 hours.

== Analysis ==

The three parts of all infographics are the visual, the content, and the knowledge. The visual consists of colors and graphics. There are two different types of graphics – theme, and reference. These graphics are included in all infographics and represent the underlying visual representation of the data. Reference graphics are generally icons that can be used to point to certain data, although they are not always found in infographics. Statistics and facts usually serve as the content for infographics and can be obtained from any number of sources, including census data and news reports. One of the most important aspects of infographics is that they contain some sort of insight into the data that they are presenting – this is the knowledge.

Infographics are effective because of their visual element. Humans receive input from all five of their senses (sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste), but they receive significantly more information from vision than any of the other four. Fifty percent of the human brain is dedicated to visual functions, and images are processed faster than text. The brain processes pictures all at once, but processes text in a linear fashion, meaning it takes much longer to obtain information from text. Entire business processes or industry sectors can be made relevant to a new audience through a guidance design technique that leads the eye. The page may link to a complete report, but the infographic primes the reader making the subject-matter more accessible. Online trends, such as the increasingly short attention span of Internet users, has also contributed to the increasing popularity and effectiveness of infographics. 

When designing the visual aspect of an infographic, a number of considerations must be made to optimize the effectiveness of the visualization. The six components of visual encoding are spatial, marks, connection, enclosure, retinal properties, and temporal encoding. Each of these can be utilized in its own way to represent relationships between different types of data. However, studies have shown that spatial position is the most effective way to represent numerical data and leads to the fastest and easiest understanding by viewers. Therefore, the designers often spatially represent the most important relationship being depicted in an infographic.

There are also three basic provisions of communication that need to be assessed when designing an infographic – appeal, comprehension, and retention. &quot;Appeal&quot; is the idea that communication needs to engage its audience. Comprehension implies that the viewer should be able to easily understand the information that is presented to them. And finally, &quot;retention&quot; means that the viewer should remember the data presented by the infographic. The order of importance of these provisions depends on the purpose of the infographic. If the infographic is meant to convey information in an unbiased way, such as in the domains of academia or science, comprehension should be considered first, then retention, and finally, appeal. However, if the infographic is being used for commercial purposes, then appeal becomes most important, followed by retention and comprehension. When infographics are being used for editorial purposes, such as in a newspaper, the appeal is again most important but is followed first by comprehension and then retention.

However, the appeal and the retention can in practice be put together with the aid of a comprehensible layout design. Recently, as an attempt to study the effect of the layout of an infographic on the comprehension of the viewers, a new Neural Network-based cognitive load estimation method was applied on different types of common layouts for the infographic design. When the varieties of factors listed above are taken into consideration when designing infographics, they can be a highly efficient and effective way to convey large amounts of information in a visual manner.

== Data visualization ==

Data visualizations are often used in infographics and may make up the entire infographic. There are many types of visualizations that can be used to represent the same set of data. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the appropriate visualization for the data set and infographic by taking into consideration graphical features such as position, size, shape, and color. There are primarily five types of visualization categories – time-series data, statistical distributions, maps, hierarchies, and networking.

=== Time-series ===

Time-series data is one of the most common forms of data visualization. It documents sets of values over time. Examples of graphics in this category include index charts, stacked graphs, small multiples, and horizon graphs. Index charts are ideal to use when raw values are less important than relative changes. It is an interactive line chart that shows percentage changes for a collection of time-series data based on a selected index point. For example, stock investors could use this because they are less concerned with the specific price and more concerned with the rate of growth. Stacked graphs are area charts that are stacked on top of each other, and depict aggregate patterns. They allow viewers to see overall patterns and individual patterns. However, they do not support negative numbers and make it difficult to accurately interpret trends. An alternative to stacked graphs is small multiples. Instead of stacking each area chart, each series is individually shown so the overall trends of each sector are more easily interpreted. Horizon graphs are a space efficient method to increase the data density of a time-series while preserving resolution.

=== Statistical ===
Statistical distributions reveal trends based on how numbers are distributed. Common examples include histograms and box-and-whisker plots, which convey statistical features such as mean, median, and outliers. In addition to these common infographics, alternatives include stem-and-leaf plots, Q–Q plots, scatter plot matrices (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates. For assessing a collection of numbers and focusing on frequency distribution, stem-and-leaf plots can be helpful. The numbers are binned based on the first significant digit, and within each stack binned again based on the second significant digit. On the other hand, Q–Q plots compare two probability distributions by graphing quantiles against each other. This allows the viewer to see if the plot values are similar and if the two are linearly related. SPLOM is a technique that represents the relationships among multiple variables. It uses multiple scatter plots to represent a pairwise relation among variables. Another statistical distribution approach to visualize multivariate data is parallel coordinates. Rather than graphing every pair of variables in two dimensions, the data is repeatedly plotted on a parallel axis, and corresponding points are then connected with a line. The advantage of parallel coordinates is that they are relatively compact, allowing many variables to be shown simultaneously.

=== Maps ===
Maps are a natural way to represent geographical data. Time and space can be depicted through the use of flow maps. Line strokes are used with various widths and colors to help encode information. Choropleth maps, which encode data through color and geographical region, are also commonly used. Graduated symbol maps are another method to represent geographical data. They are an alternative to choropleth map and use symbols, such as pie charts for each area, over a map. This map allows for more dimensions to be represented using various shapes, sizes, and colors. Cartograms, on the other hand, completely distort the shape of a region and directly encode a data variable. Instead of using a geographic map, regions are redrawn proportionally to the data. For example, each region can be represented by a circle and the size/color is directly proportional to other information, such as population size.

=== Hierarchies ===

Many data sets, such as spatial entities of countries or common structures for governments, can be organized into natural hierarchies. Node-link diagrams, adjacency diagrams, and enclosure diagrams are all types of infographics that effectively communicate hierarchical data. Node-link diagrams are a popular method due to the tidy and space-efficient results. A node-link diagram is similar to a tree, where each node branches off into multiple sub-sections. An alternative is adjacency diagrams, which is a space-filling variant of the node-link diagram. Instead of drawing a link between hierarchies, nodes are drawn as solid areas with sub-sections inside of each section. This method allows for size to be easily represented than in the node-link diagrams. Enclosure diagrams are also a space-filling visualization method. However, they use containment rather than adjacency to represent the hierarchy. Similar to the adjacency diagram, the size of the node is easily represented in this model.

=== Networks ===
Network visualization explores relationships, such as friendships and cliques. Three common types are force-directed layout, arc diagrams, and matrix view. Force-directed layouts are a common and intuitive approach to network layout. In this system, nodes are similar to charged particles, which repel each other. Links are used to pull related nodes together. Arc diagrams are one-dimensional layouts of nodes with circular arcs linking each node. When used properly, with good order in nodes, cliques and bridges are easily identified in this layout. Alternatively, mathematicians and computer scientists more often use matrix views. Each value has an (x,y) value in the matrix that corresponds to a node. By using color and saturation instead of text, values associated with the links can be perceived rapidly. While this method makes it hard to view the path of the nodes, there are no line crossings, which in a large and highly connected network can quickly become too cluttered.

While all of these visualizations can be effectively used on their own, many modern infographics combine multiple types into one graphic, along with other features, such as illustrations and text. Some modern infographics do not even contain data visualization, and instead are simply a colorful and succinct ways to present knowledge. Fifty-three percent of the 30 most-viewed infographics on the infographic sharing site visual.ly did not contain actual data.

=== Comparison infographics ===

Comparison infographics are a type of visual representation that focuses on comparing and contrasting different elements, such as products, services, options, or features. These infographics are designed to help viewers make informed decisions by presenting information in a clear and concise manner. Comparison infographics can be highly effective in simplifying complex data and highlighting key differences between multiple items.

== Tools ==
Infographics can be created by hand using simple everyday tools such as graph paper, pencils, markers, and rulers. However, today they are more often created using computer software, which is often both faster and easier. They can be created with general illustration software.

Diagrams can be manually created and drawn using software, which can be downloaded for the desktop or used online. Templates can be used to get users started on their diagrams. Additionally, the software allows users to collaborate on diagrams in real time over the Internet.

There are also numerous tools to create very specific types of visualizations, such as creating a visualization based on embedded data in the photos on a user&#x27;s smartphone. Users can create an infographic of their resume or a &quot;picture of their digital life.&quot;

<text>Frank Duncan Riggs (September 5, 1950 – December 20, 2023) was an American U.S. army veteran, law enforcement officer, charter school executive, and Republican politician from the states of California and Arizona. He served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 1990s.

==Early life==
Frank Riggs was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on September 5, 1950. He served in the United States Army from 1972 to 1975.

==Career==
An Army veteran, having served as a Military Police officer, Riggs worked as a police officer and deputy sheriff in Santa Barbara, California, and Sonoma County, respectively. He was a member of the Windsor Unified School District Board of Trustees from 1984 to 1988 and was a real estate executive and owner of his own development company for over 20 years.

In 1999, Riggs joined the board of the Charter Schools Development Corporation, and served with CSDC until 2012. During his service, CSDC went from being a start-up nonprofit to a national leader in financing and developing educational facilities for charter schools, reaching $125 million in assets, and procuring and leveraging private capital for facility acquisitions and improvements worth $680 million; representing over four million square feet of facilities for 235 charter schools in 25 states.

In 2001, he moved to Arizona. He served as CEO of ABS School Services of Phoenix, which provides financial accounting and business management services to approximately 200 school district charter, private, and federal grant schools. Riggs was also the founding board president for Arizona Connections Academy, a statewide on-line charter school. He resided in Scottsdale, Arizona for 14 years.

===California Congressman===
Riggs was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in 1990 from California&#x27;s 1st District, narrowly defeating four-term Democrat Doug Bosco. He represented the area stretching from Napa County to the northern Pacific coast. He served in the 102nd, 104th, and 105th Congresses. During his service, he was on the House Appropriations Committee (including the Agriculture and the Energy and Water Development Subcommittees), the House Transportation and Public Works Committee, and the House Banking and Financial Affairs Committee.

Riggs also served on the House Education and Workforce Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families in the 105th Congress. In that capacity, he authored the Charter School Expansion Act (signed into law by P↑resident Bill Clinton in October, 1998) which provides federal start-up grants to newly formed charter schools to help defray their initial operating expenses.
Most Arizona charter schools have received federal start-up grants as a result of Riggs&#x27;s legislation.

Riggs voted against the Gulf War resolution and, as a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of freshman Republican congressmen, favored identifying publicly the congressmen who made overdrafts at the House Bank. He was defeated in 1992 by Democrat Dan Hamburg but won a rematch in 1994.

In 1996, he won re-election over Democrat Michela Alioto-Pier by about four percentage points.

===California U.S. Senate campaign===
In 1998, Riggs faced a potentially competitive contest against State Senator Mike Thompson, who was due to be termed out of his seat. Thompson&#x27;s state senate district was virtually coextensive with the congressional district. Riggs decided not to run for re-election. Instead, he ran for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. A late entrant, he dropped out of the race before Election Day but still finished in fifth place (the fourth place Republican) in the state&#x27;s open primary system. The nomination was won by State Treasurer Matt Fong, who went on to lose the general election to Barbara Boxer, seeking her second term in the Senate. Meanwhile, Thompson easily won the congressional race.

===Arizona campaigns===

In 2005, he explored a run for governor, as most Arizona Republicans were deciding not to challenge popular Governor Janet Napolitano for reelection the following year. However, he discovered that he had to be a five-year resident of Arizona in order to run for governor.

In 2014, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Arizona, finishing last in the Republican primary with less than five percent of the vote.

In 2016, Riggs created an exploratory candidacy for the Arizona Corporation Commission, but ultimately did not run for the position.

===Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction campaign===

In the 2018 Arizona Republican primary election, Riggs ran for state Superintendent of Public Instruction against college professor Dr. Bob Branch, incumbent Diane Douglas, former Basis Charter Schools Director of Charter School Development Jonathan Gelbart, and former public school teacher Tracy Livingston. A week after the election in which Riggs traded the lead with Dr. Branch several times, Riggs came out ahead by only 249 votes. However, he lost the race to Democrat Kathy Hoffman in the November 6, 2018, general election.

==Death==
Riggs died in Arizona on December 20, 2023, at the age of 73.

<text>NGC 188 (also known as Caldwell 1 or the Polarissima Cluster) is an open cluster in the constellation Cepheus. It was discovered by John Herschel in 1825.
Unlike most open clusters that drift apart after a few million years because of the gravitational interaction of our Milky Way galaxy, NGC 188 lies far above the plane of the galaxy and is one of the most ancient of open clusters known, at approximately 6.8 billion years old.

NGC 188 is very close to the North Celestial Pole, under five degrees away, and in the constellation of Cepheus at an estimated 5,000 light-years&#x27; distance, this puts it slightly above the Milky Way&#x27;s disc and further from the center of the galaxy than the Sun.

<doc id="992538" wikidata="Q1164699" url="?curid=992538" title="Struct (C programming language)">
<text>In the C programming language, struct is the keyword used to define a composite, a.k.a. record, data type a named set of values that occupy a block of memory. It allows for the different values to be accessed via a single identifier, often a pointer. A struct can contain other data types so is used for mixed-data-type records. For example a bank customer struct might contains fields: name, address, telephone, balance.

A struct occupies a &quot;contiguous block&quot; of memory, usually delimited (sized) by word-length boundaries. It corresponds to the similarly named feature available in some assemblers for Intel processors. Being a block of contiguous memory, each field within a struct is located at a certain fixed offset from the start.

The sizeof operator results in the number of bytes needed to store a particular struct, just as it does for a primitive data type. The alignment of particular fields in the struct (with respect to word boundaries) is implementation-specific and may include padding. Modern compilers typically support the codice_1 directive, which sets the size in bytes for alignment.

The C struct feature was derived from the same-named concept in ALGOL 68.

== Declaration ==

The syntax for a struct declaration is shown by this simple example:
struct tag_name {
 type member1;
 type member2;


The codice_2 is optional in some contexts.

==Typedef==

Via the keyword codice_3, a struct type can be referenced without using the codice_4 keyword. However, some programming style guides advise against this, claiming that it can obfuscate the type.

For example:

typedef struct tag_name {
 type member1;
 type member2;
} thing_t;
thing_t thing;
In C++ code, typedef is not needed because types defined via codice_4 are part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either codice_6 or codice_7.

== Initialization ==

There are three ways to initialize a structure. 

For the type:
struct point_t {
 int x;
 int y;


&quot;C89-style initializers&quot; are used when contiguous members may be given. For example:
struct point_t a = { 1, 2 };
For non contiguous or out of order members list, &quot;designated initializer&quot; style may be used. For example:
struct point_t a = { .y = 2, .x = 1 };
If an initializer is given or if the object is statically allocated, omitted elements are initialized to 0.

A third way of initializing a structure is to copy the value of an existing object of the same type. For example:
struct point_t b = a;
== Copy ==

The state of a struct can be copied to another instance. A compiler might use codice_8 to copy the bytes of the memory block.
struct point_t a = { 1, 3 };
struct point_t b;
b = a;
== Pointers ==

Pointers can be used to refer to a codice_4 by its address. This is useful for passing a struct to a function to avoid the overhead of copying the struct. The codice_10 operator dereferences the pointer (left operand) and accesses the value of a struct member (right operand).
struct point_t point = { 3, 7 };
int x = point.x;
point.x = 10;
struct point_t *pp = &amp;point;
x = pp-&gt;x;
pp-&gt;x = 8;
== In other languages ==

===C++===

In C++, struct is essentially the same as for C. Further, a class is the same as a struct but with different default visibility: class members are private by default, whereas struct members are public by default.

===.NET===

.NET languages have a feature similar to struct in C called codice_4 in C# and codice_12 in Visual Basic .NET). This construct provides many features of a class, but acts as a value type instead of a reference type. For example, when passing a .NET struct to a function, the value is copied so that changes to the input parameter do not affect the value passed in.

<text>Hawks is a 1988 British comedy drama film directed by Robert Ellis Miller and based on a short story written by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and David English. The musical score was composed by Gibb.

The plot follows two terminally ill patients, an English lawyer named Bancroft (Timothy Dalton) and young American ex-football player Deckermensky (Anthony Edwards), who decide to sneak out of their hospital rooms and live life to its fullest for whatever time they have left. The film’s screenplay was written by Roy Clarke.

== Premise ==
Bancroft and Deckermensky are two terminally ill cancer patients who sneak out of the hospital for a series of adventures, their main goal being to reach a famed brothel in Amsterdam. In a stolen ambulance, they make their way to Holland. Along the way, the duo stop over at a wedding, where Bancroft’s former flame who abandoned him when he became ill is a bridesmaid. They also encounter various characters, including a pair of misfit British women, Hazel and Maureen. Though Maureen and Decker hit it off, Bancroft sees the women—who are unaware of the men’s terminal condition—as a distraction from his quest with Decker.

==Cast==
*Timothy Dalton as Bancroft 
*Anthony Edwards as Deckermensky a.k.a. &quot;Decker&quot;
*Janet McTeer as Hazel 
*Camille Coduri as Maureen 
*Jill Bennett as Vivian Bancroft

<text>Shek O is an area of the south-eastern part of Hong Kong Island, in Hong Kong. It can refer to Shek O village, Shek O Peninsula or Shek O Headland. Administratively, they are part of Southern District.
==Geography==
The name &quot;Shek O&quot; literally means the &quot;rocky bay&quot;. The entire area is a peninsula on the southern coast of the Hong Kong Island, facing the South China Sea. Shek O is surrounded by Shek O Country Park, Big Wave Bay and Cape D&#x27;Aguilar.

==Shek O Village==
Shek O Village () has a history of some 200 years. It was established by fishermen of the Chan, Yip, Li and Lau clans and was once famous for its lobster. The majority of the population previously lived on the land presently occupied by the Shek O country Club, from where it was forcibly removed. In 1841, Shek O Village as a whole, together with Hok Tsui Village () and Tai Long Wan Village (), had a population of around 200.

The Tin Hau Temple in Shek O Village was built in 1891. It is a Grade III historic building, and its management has been delegated by the Chinese Temples Committee to the Shek O Residents Association. The memorial archway near the main entrance road to the town is inscribed with the calligraphy of R.C. Lee () (1905–1983).

The modernist Shek O Bus Terminus building next door was constructed in 1955 and designed by Hsin Yieh Architects, founded by Chinese architect Su Gin Djih (). However, the earliest bus service to Shek O dates back to the 1920s, when the Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Limited operated a bus route between the Hong Kong Hotel and Big Wave Bay in Shek O.

==Outdoor activities==
Shek O Beach is a sandy public beach at Shek O. The water quality is fair and is gazetted Grade 2. It is a popular weekend and holiday destination, offering a public barbecue area and many restaurants. The rocky cliffs provide an excellent place for sports climbing.

Around one mile north of Shek O beach, after passing the Shek O Country Club, is Big Wave Bay. As its name suggests, big waves roll on to the beach, propelled by the wind, making it a popular destination for surfers. Wind surfers can be found in the sea off Big Wave Bay and Shek O beaches. The Dragon&#x27;s Back above Shek O is home to Hong Kong Island&#x27;s only paragliding site. Paragliders can be seen riding the lift and landing at the nearby Rocky Bay. Big Wave Bay Beach is also the site of prehistoric rock carving similar to those found on Cheung Chau Island.

Both beaches have basic bars and restaurants, and equipment hire, such as body boards and lilos. In addition, Shek O Beach has a small golf course.

Due to the isolated location of Shek O, the environment near the beach remains rustic and quiet, which is one of the area&#x27;s main attractions.

The Shek O Country Club () is built around a par 65 private golf course. Its history goes back to 1919. The construction of the Clubhouse was completed in 1925.

=== Golf ===
Shek O Country Club is a private golf club sitting on the Shek O peninsula with a history dating back to 1921. The course is short, playing to a par 65, with no par 5s and only two par 4s measuring over 350 yards.

===Drownings ===
Shek O Beach has been noted as generally suffering from the highest drowning rate among Hong Kong&#x27;s beaches, although this is not reflected in official statistics as the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) only records incidents which occur while lifeguards are on duty. Residents estimated nine drowning deaths at the beach in 2011, and seven in 2012, figures which were not disputed by the LCSD. The high rate of accidents at the beach has been attributed to its high patronage, usually strong waves, the steep underwater slope of the beach, swimmer inexperience and poor public awareness of water safety principles.

==In popular culture==
The scenery of Shek O is the setting of numerous Cantopop music videos. The Hong Kong director Stephen Chow&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;King of Comedy&quot; () was also shot at Shek O.

==Transportation==
Shek O is served by Shek O Road, which connects Tai Tam Road to Stanley and Chai Wan. There is public transport link toward Shek O Beach: bus route 9 and red minibuses from Shau Kei Wan. There is limited parking near the beach.

==Education==
Shek O is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 16. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and two government schools: Shau Kei Wan Government Primary School and Aldrich Bay Government Primary School.

<text>Enemy Ace () is a DC Comics property about the adventures of a skilled but troubled German anti-hero and flying ace in World War I and World War II, Hans von Hammer, known to the world as &quot;The Hammer of Hell&quot;. Debuting in 1965, the comic was written by Robert Kanigher and drawn by Joe Kubert and the character has been revived several times since by other writers and artists.

==Overview==
Enemy Ace first appeared in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #151 (February 1965), in a backup story that quickly gained popularity. As a World War I pilot flying for the Germans, his stories told the German side of the war, in which Hans von Hammer was a man of honor and chivalry, a flying knight in his Fokker Dr.I, but he was haunted by his duties and the constant death surrounding them.
The early series stories centered around World War I aerial combat and the tactics employed by the early knights of the air, along with their honor. The stories were often a stark contrast between the dark brooding character Von Hammer and his softer, kinder side as in &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; #148 where Von Hammer rescues a little dog he names &quot;Schatzi&quot; and proceeds to befriend him, even introducing him to his dark hunting companion the gray wolf who accepts little Schatzi rather than eating him. The Von Hammer stories were not big on happy endings, and Von Hammer goes on to lose Schatzi in a haunting scene by dropping him accidentally from his Fokker during air combat. He grieves the loss of the dog, then proceeds to massacre the remaining British pilots in an act of bloody revenge. Von Hammer was a dark character, portrayed as the inevitable result of war.

Unlike most comic book characters, Von Hammer does not have an arch-enemy, though a French pilot known as The Hangman was a persistent opponent. The majority of Von Hammer&#x27;s opponents follow the same code of honor as he does, which includes not attacking a helpless pilot.

Created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert, the Enemy Ace was based loosely on Manfred von Richthofen. Both flew Crimson Red Fokker DR1 triplanes. Both were of aristocratic blood. Both awarded themselves a trophy with each downed enemy plane. Both were the highest scoring flying ace of the First World War. The main difference between the two was that Von Hammer survived to old age, whereas Von Richthofen was shot down and killed before the war ended.

The character&#x27;s stories have been praised as among DC&#x27;s strongest war stories of the Silver Age of comic books. He was revived for a few graphic novels. The first was &quot;Enemy Ace: War Idyll&quot; (1990) by George Pratt, where Hammer is revealed to have lived until 1969, dying peacefully upon turning over his memoirs to and concluding his interviews with a troubled Vietnam War veteran-turned-journalist.

Tim Truman&#x27;s &quot;Guns Of The Dragon&quot; 1998 mini-series saw Von Hammer in 1927 China teaming up with an elderly Bat Lash and Biff Bradley, the brother of Slam Bradley against Miss Fear and Vandal Savage on an adventure to Dinosaur Island.
A more recent work is Garth Ennis&#x27;s &quot;Enemy Ace: War in Heaven&quot; (2001), with art by Chris Weston and Russ Heath. Here, von Hammer&#x27;s character and story arc is based on several real-life German pilots, notably Adolf Galland. The series recounts the pilot&#x27;s activities during World War II where he is persuaded to once again fight as a pilot of the Luftwaffe. Von Hammer is placed in charge of his own gruppe and initially serves on the Eastern Front. Though no friend to the Nazi regime, he rapidly amasses numerous kills flying a red-painted Bf 109 against the Russians, and later in defense of Germany (flying a scarlet Me 262) against American bombers. Nevertheless, von Hammer becomes increasingly disillusioned as he continues to witness the horrors of war. During a battle, he is shot down and crashes near Leningrad. In his attempts to make it back to his own lines, he witnesses many horrible sights on the Russian front, including cannibalism.
In 1945, after bailing out of his damaged aircraft, he inadvertently parachutes into the Dachau concentration camp and is outraged to discover the German perpetration of the Holocaust. His patience with the Nazi regime at an end, Von Hammer proposes a mutiny upon returning to his airbase and later surrenders his Jagdverband to advancing Allied troops, namely Sgt. Rock&#x27;s Easy Company, after setting fire to the fighter unit&#x27;s remaining aircraft.

Von Hammer makes a guest appearance of sorts as an opponent of General Wade Eiling&#x27;s father in a tale set during the First World War.

In 2008, he is featured in Bruce Jones&#x27; &quot;The War that Time Forgot&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Booster Gold&quot; in 2009, during World War I. When Booster is thrown back in time and caught in the middle of the war, alongside Cyrus Lord, the ancestor of Maxwell Lord, von Hammer aids their escape from captivity behind German lines rather than abet their torture and further stain his hands with blood.

In &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, Enemy Ace is among the superheroes who Batman resurrects using a Black Lantern ring.

==Von Hammer&#x27;s descendants==
A possible descendant of Von Hammer appears in the story &quot;Ghost of the Killer Skies&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #404 (Oct. 1970). Batman investigates sabotage and murder taking place during shooting of a biographical film based on Von Hammer. The mastermind behind the sabotage is stunt pilot Heinrich Frans, who bears a strong resemblance to Von Hammer and claims that he was his ancestor. Believing that Von Hammer was a ruthless man, Frans is outraged that the film&#x27;s story has his ancestor showing respect and mercy to his enemies, despite Batman countering that Von Hammer&#x27;s story is more one of &quot;a man caught between his feeling of duty and his own best instincts&quot;. Frans falls to his death during an aerial duel with Batman, both men using vintage World War I planes. During the duel, it is heavily implied that the spirit of Von Hammer helps Batman pilot his craft far better than the crimefighter could on his own. At the end, it is not confirmed if Heinrich Frans was indeed Von Hammer&#x27;s descendant.

In issue #139 of the &quot;Robin&quot; series, von Hammer&#x27;s great-granddaughter Lieutenant Ilsa von Hammer appeared as part of a group of soldiers that included Johnny Cloud&#x27;s grandson and a legendary soldier known only as the Veteran. This group, handling missions which may be more unusual than the normal military is equipped for, recruits Robin to assist on their missions.

Another possible descendant appears in &quot;Superman&quot; #689. Will Von Hammer works as a private investigator in Berlin. He possesses some superhuman invulnerability as he is also the descendant of World War II hero Stormy Foster. In DC&#x27;s &#x27;New 52&#x27; &quot;Shade&quot; mini-series, Will helps the Shade in tracking down the latter&#x27;s past.

&quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #86-87 revealed von Hammer and his father, Otto von Hammer, to be ancestors of the Arcane clan (Anton, Gregori, Anais, Aniela, Abigail, Tefe and others).

An unnamed gorilla wearing Enemy Ace&#x27;s costume appears as a minor character in 2019&#x27;s &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;. He is part of Gorilla City&#x27;s air defenses and, in the past, he flew his biplane to face a giant Jimmy Olsen turned into an ape, who was wrecking havoc in their city. In the present, he shows up alongside a myriad of minor characters to help Jimmy fight a robot invasion.

==Von Hammer&#x27;s aircraft==
* Fokker Dr.I - World War I
* Messerschmitt Bf 109F - early World War II
* Messerschmitt Bf 109G - Eastern Front
* Messerschmitt Me 262 - used late war until surrender.

Note: Not only are all of Von Hammer&#x27;s aircraft painted bright red, his World War II aircraft lacked the standard swastika insignia on the tail, which causes friction with one of his officers who is fervently loyal to the Nazi Party.

==Collected editions==
There have been a number of trade paperback collections as well as original graphic novels:
* &quot;Enemy Ace: War Idyll&quot; (by George Pratt, graphic novel, 128 pages, hardcover (1990), softcover (1995), )
* &quot;The Enemy Ace Archives&quot; (by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert):
** &quot;Volume 1&quot; (212 pages, October 2002, hardcover, , collects: &quot;Our Army at War&quot; (1952) #151, #153, #155; &quot;Showcase&quot; (1956) #57-58; &quot;Star-Spangled War Stories&quot; (1952) #138-142)

It says &quot;completing the collection of all of the original Kanigher/Kubert Enemy Ace tales (and adding in collaborations with artists Neal Adams, Russ Heath and Frank Thorne), this volume&#x27;s ten stories display some of comics&#x27; greatest talents at the peak of their creative powers...&quot; The book contains 13 stories and does not include any stories by Neal Adams, but is credited with one story as artist WITH Joe Kubert (issue #144-&quot;Death Takes No Holiday&quot;..). Two Enemy Ace-branded stories from &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #146 are not included in this collection as they are not, in fact, Enemy Ace stories. They were both retitled reprints of previously-published non-Enemy Ace stories (&quot;Balloon for a Hawk&quot; from &quot;Our Fighting Forces&quot; #60, retitled as &quot;No! I will not go up in that papier mâché coffin!&quot; and &quot;My Brother, The Enemy Ace!&quot; from &quot;All-American Men of War&quot; #101, retitled as &quot;Brother Enemy!&quot;), each with a single Kubert-drawn introductory page added (featuring Von Hammer).

<text>Exchange Square () is a building complex located in Central, Hong Kong. It houses offices and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It is served by the Central and Hong Kong stations of the MTR metro system.

Most of the Exchange Square is owned by Hong Kong Land, with the remaining portion owned by the Government. The building has three blocks, namely, &quot;One Exchange Square&quot;, &quot;Two Exchange Square&quot; and &quot;Three Exchange Square&quot;. A shopping block known as &quot;The Forum&quot; was redeveloped as an office building in 2011–14.

The ground level houses a large bus terminus, Central (Exchange Square) Bus Terminus.

==Tenants==
The property is the home of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong since the 1980s. It also houses many international banking and law firms including Bank of Montreal, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Lloyd George Management, DLA Piper, Ropes &amp; Gray, RPC, Latham &amp; Watkins and Allen &amp; Overy. Other major tenants include Sixth Street Partners, Aberdeen Standard Investment, Angelo Gordon, Bluepool Capital, China Merchants Securities, CSOP, CQS, Evercore, Fanda Partners, Harvest Fund, Hillhouse Capital, Hopu Investment and Janchor Partners. Exchange Square is also home to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, the American Club of Hong Kong, and the consulates in Hong Kong of Argentina, Canada, and Japan.

==Plot==
Hong Kong Land tendered the government HK$4.76 billion for the plot in February 1982, when the market was at a record high. Prices subsequently dropped, necessitating its debt to be restructured. In February 1983, HKL obtained an eight-year loan of HK$4 billion, a record. In December 1983, it announced that the plot was to be mortgaged to secure a HK$2.5 billion loan facility. The second instalment of HK$2 billion on the plot was due in the financial year 1984/85.
==Phase three==
Development cost HK$750m, 32-storey office tower, mall, substructure contractor Gammon Hong Kong.

==The Forum==
&quot;The Forum&quot; () was a shopping complex at the podium level. From 2011 to 2014, it was redeveloped into a seven-storey office building with a floor area of 4,460 sq m. It is wholly occupied by Standard Chartered Bank. The plaza outside the forum includes a landscaped roof garden, stepped terraces and fountains, and a collection of sculptures by artists such as Henry Moore, Ju Ming and Dame Elizabeth Frank.

<text>NGC 206 is a bright star cloud in the Andromeda Galaxy, and the brightest star cloud in Andromeda when viewed from Earth. It was discovered by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1786 and possibly even two years earlier when he observed &quot;a streak of milky nebulosity, horizontal, or part of the 31st Nebula.&quot;

==Features==
NGC 206 is the richest and most conspicuous star cloud in the Andromeda Galaxy, and is one of the largest and brightest star-forming regions in the Local Group. It contains more than 300 stars brighter than Mb=−3.6. It was originally identified by Edwin Hubble as a star cluster but today, due to its size, it is classified as an OB association.

NGC 206 is located in a spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy, in a zone free of neutral hydrogen. It contains hundreds of stars of spectral types O and B. The star cloud has a double structure: one region has an age of around 10 million years and includes several H II regions in its border; the other region has an age of 40 to 50 million years and includes a number of cepheids. The two regions are separated by a band of interstellar dust.

<doc id="992577" wikidata="Q1569265" url="?curid=992577" title="1987 World Series">
<text>The 1987 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1987 season. The 84th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Twins defeated the Cardinals four games to three to win the Series, their first in Minnesota and the first since last winning as the Washington Senators in 1924. Twins pitcher Frank Viola was named as the 1987 World Series MVP.

It was the first World Series to feature games played indoors, and the first in which the home team won every game; this would happen again in (also a Twins championship, over the Atlanta Braves) and in with the Arizona Diamondbacks defeating the New York Yankees. 

This was the third of six World Series played entirely on artificial turf, with the others in , , , , and .

This is the first World Series in which the series logo appeared on the jerseys; only the Cardinals wore it. Both contestants in the following year&#x27;s World Series wore a patch. It was also the last World Series in which any games were played during the day as opposed to in the evening.

==Summary==

The 1987 World Series was the first World Series games played in an indoor stadium (the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome) and, to date, the last World Series game to start earlier than prime time in the eastern United States (Game 6 started at 4:00 p.m. ET/3:00 p.m. CT), and it was the first World Series in which all games were won by the home team. (Four previous series had the home team winning the first six games, including the 1965 World Series, when the Twins dropped Game 7 to the Dodgers.) The bottom half of the ninth inning was never played in any game of this Series, the first and only time this has happened. In 1987, the Twins set the record for the worst (full 162 game) regular season win–loss record of any World Series championship team (85–77, .525). This record stood until it was broken when the Cardinals won the 2006 Series after going 83–78 (.516).

Besides setting a record for the worst regular season winning percentage for a World Series winner and hosting the first World Series game indoors, the Twins were the first team to enter the World Series having been outscored in the regular season. The Twins, as a team, were outnumbered in virtually every major statistical category in 1987. As ABC play-by-play commentator Al Michaels put it in the pre-game show for Game 1, &quot;They were out everything!&quot;

The Cardinals posted a 95–67 record during the regular season, but were hindered by injuries in the postseason, most notably with the loss of their lone home-run threat, first baseman Jack Clark, who sprained his right ankle in a game in Montreal on September 9. During the regular season, Clark led the National League in on-base percentage and slugging percentage despite playing in Busch Memorial Stadium, which was reputed to be the league&#x27;s most extreme &quot;pitcher&#x27;s park.&quot; He hit 35 home runs in 131 games, and was the only person on the team to hit more than 12. The player on the team who hit 12, starting third baseman Terry Pendleton (though named to the World Series roster) was hampered with a ribcage injury. Normally a switch-hitter, Pendleton was only able to swing lefthanded during the World Series and was also unable to play the field and thus was relegated to pinch-hitting duties or being the designated hitter in the games in Minnesota started by right-handed starters.

Game 7 was won by Minnesota on the 35th birthday of the Twins&#x27; Roy Smalley – and was also the last game of his career. Smalley appeared in four games as a pinch-hitter and reached base all four times on a double, an error, and two walks.

==Matchups==
===Game 1===
A raucous, sold-out Metrodome met the Cardinals on October 17, stunning the visitors with crowd noise that could exceed 110 decibels SPL. The Cardinals struggled defensively, with outfielder Willie McGee losing sight of pop flies against the Metrodome&#x27;s white roof in the fourth and eighth innings, and infielder Tom Lawless committing an infield error in the sixth inning. None of those miscues, however, contributed to Twins runs. The Twins&#x27; aggressive play further compounded the problems of the Cards, and the game ended as a 10–1 blowout. Starting pitcher Frankie &quot;Sweet Music&quot; Viola had little trouble with the Cardinals&#x27; potent lineup. For the Twins, Dan Gladden hit a grand slam and totaled five RBIs, capping off a seven-run fourth inning, with Steve Lombardozzi adding a two-run homer, while Kent Hrbek had two RBIs.

Frank Viola was scheduled to be best man at his brother&#x27;s wedding, but had to cancel when the Twins reached the World Series as it fell on the same night as Game 1, in which he was scheduled as starter. ABC showed clips of the wedding throughout the game&#x27;s broadcast.

Coincidentally, the song &quot;U Got The Look&quot; peaked in popularity (#2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart) on this date. The song was written and performed by Prince (a Minneapolis native) and contains the line &quot;boy versus girl in the World Series of love&quot;.

===Game 2===
While improving on their Game One performance, the Cards were again unable to hold the Twins offense and fell behind 7–0 before beginning to rally. The Cards&#x27; total of nine hits was just one short of the Twins but they managed only one double, against three doubles and two home runs hit by Minnesota. Gary Gaetti hit a homer in the second inning. The Twins broke the game open in the fourth, scoring six runs resulting in starter Danny Cox being pulled from the game. The final score was 8–4. Randy Bush and Tim Laudner each came through with a pair of two-run-scoring hits in the fourth, with Laudner&#x27;s being a home run and Bush&#x27;s being a double. Bert Blyleven pitched seven innings of two-run baseball for the win.
===Game 3===
Traveling down the Mississippi, to the open air of Busch Stadium, Game 3 saw a tense pitching duel between Twins starter Les Straker and John Tudor of the Cardinals. This match-up was also notable for Straker being the first Venezuelan to pitch in a World Series game.

After five scoreless innings by both teams, the Twins broke through in the top of the sixth inning. Greg Gagne walked to lead off the inning, and Kirby Puckett walked to move Gagne into scoring position. Tom Brunansky&#x27;s RBI single looked like all the offense the game would see. But, in the bottom of the seventh, Juan Berenguer, in relief of Straker, surrendered leadoff back-to-back singles to Jose Oquendo and Tony Peña. Terry Pendleton sacrificed the runners to second and third, and Vince Coleman slammed a two-run double to give the Cards a 2–1 lead. Ozzie Smith followed by singling in Coleman for the final run, and Todd Worrell closed out saving the win for Tudor.

===Game 4===
In Game 4, the Twins scored first on Greg Gagne’s home run, but the Cardinals tied it on a Jim Lindeman RBI single. Tom Lawless hit a three-run homer in the fourth off Viola (only his second Major League homer after going 2 for 25 during the regular season), one of Viola&#x27;s five earned runs in the game and six runs in the fourth. The Cards, however, weren&#x27;t done scoring; Dan Schatzeder allowed another RBI single to Lindeman and a two-run double to Willie McGee. Joe Niekro and George Frazier shut the Redbirds out the rest of the game. Bob Forsch got the win with innings of one run relief. Starter Greg Mathews aggravated a quadriceps injury in the fourth inning (the injury went back to Game 5 of the NLCS), had to be removed from the game and was unable to play for the rest of the series. Ken Dayley got the save.

Just prior to Game 4, Reggie Jackson, who was working as a field reporter for ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1987 World Series, admitted that he didn&#x27;t know who Tom Lawless was.
===Game 5===
Game 5 was a much closer contest, with the Cardinals coming out victorious by a score of 4–2. Curt Ford hit a two-run single in the sixth, breaking a scoreless pitcher&#x27;s duel between Danny Cox and Bert Blyleven. By the end of the seventh, the Cards were up 4–0. The Twins scored two in the eighth on a triple by Gary Gaetti off reliever Todd Worrell to make a game of it, but eventually relinquished the save to him as Gaetti failed to score. The Cardinals stole five bases in Game 5, the most for any team since the 1907 Chicago Cubs.

===Game 6===

The Series returned to the Metrodome with the Twins facing elimination (a position they would find themselves in four years later against the Atlanta Braves). ABC allowed the game to be played at 3 p.m. CT (4 p.m. ET) on Saturday afternoon – the only day game of the series, and the last World Series game to date to be played in the daytime (although as the game was played in the Metrodome, the game took place under artificial lighting).

The Cardinals drew first blood off Les Straker on a Tommy Herr home run in the first, and the Twins countered with two in their half of the first on RBI singles by Kirby Puckett and Don Baylor. The Cardinals soon tied it in the second on a Jose Oquendo RBI single.

In the fourth, the Cards chased Straker when Dan Driessen led off with a double to right and went to third on a Willie McGee single. McGee took second on the attempted throw home by center fielder Kirby Puckett. Terry Pendleton followed by singling home Driessen and Oquendo hit a sacrifice fly to make it 4–2. Another run scored for the Cards in the fifth when lefty Dan Schatzeder walked Ozzie Smith. Smith went to second on a groundout, to third on a flyout, and scored on another McGee single.

In the bottom of the fifth, however, the Twins began to claw their way back against John Tudor. Puckett led off with a single and was doubled in by Gary Gaetti. Benefitting from use of the designated hitter in their home ballpark, the Twins then tied it on a mammoth home run by their DH, Don Baylor. After Tom Brunansky followed with a single, the Twins took the lead for good when Steve Lombardozzi singled him in with two out on a close play at the plate.

The Twins then blew the game open in the sixth. Greg Gagne led off with an infield single and Puckett walked. A passed ball by Tony Peña advanced the runners. With first base open and one out, Cards veteran Bob Forsch intentionally walked Baylor to load the bases. Baylor had played only 20 regular season games with the Twins after being traded from Boston and Tim McCarver in the ABC broadcast booth argued that he should be pitched to rather than walked, despite the home run in the previous inning. Both Jim Palmer and Al Michaels agreed, as Palmer didn&#x27;t like the idea of loading the bases with the risk of giving up multiple runs, and Michaels pointed out that left-hander Ken Dayley might have to be brought in earlier than normal. After Brunansky popped out, Dayley was indeed brought in to face the lefty-hitting Kent Hrbek. Hrbek finally broke out of his slump and hit a grand slam to the deepest part of center field.

Brunansky drove in the final run in the eighth and the Twins had staved off defeat. This was the last day game in World Series history to date.

===Game 7===
Game 7 forced a National Football League game between the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings, originally scheduled for that afternoon at the Metrodome, to be played the following night (also on ABC).

Joe Magrane of the St. Louis Cardinals became only the sixth rookie pitcher to start the seventh game of a World Series. He also is the only pitcher in World Series history to start Games 1 and 7 of a World Series without any starts in between, as the Cardinals&#x27; Game 4 starter, Greg Mathews, had had to be removed early due to an injury and was unavailable for the remainder of the Series. Magrane had actually started the 1987 season pitching for the Cardinals Triple-A team, the Louisville Redbirds.

In the second, the Cardinals looked poised to send Frank Viola to an early shower. Three straight no-out singles by Jim Lindeman, Willie McGee, and Tony Peña plated the first run. Viola settled down to retire the next two hitters, but then Steve Lake singled in McGee for a 2–0 lead. Viola settled into a groove, however, and allowed only two more hits and no runs in eight strong innings.

The Twins came back in their half of the second on a Steve Lombardozzi RBI single, but not before a missed call at home plate by umpire Dave Phillips had already cost the Twins a run. Twins DH Don Baylor reached base on a hit-by-pitch by Magrane to lead off the inning and Tom Brunansky singled him to second. With one out, Tim Laudner singled to left and Baylor was called out at home on a throw from Vince Coleman in left, while replays clearly showed Baylor was safe. Lombardozzi then singled in Brunansky.

In the fifth, the Twins tied the score when Greg Gagne reached on an infield hit and Kirby Puckett drove him in with a double. Incidentally, replays showed Gagne to be out on his infield hit, thus this run served to counteract the run the Twins lost in the second on the missed call on Baylor at the plate. The Twins seemed on the verge of taking the lead when Gary Gaetti followed Puckett with a walk and went to second when Puckett was thrown out by Lake trying to advance to third on a wild pitch that was deflected when it hit the home plate umpire in the face-mask. Baylor followed with a single to left, but Coleman threw out Gaetti at the plate in a violent collision with Lake. Coleman became the first outfielder to throw two runners out at the plate in one World Series game.

The sixth inning proved to be controversial. In the top of the sixth, Tom Herr had hit a single with one out. With Jim Lindeman at bat, the third missed call of the game would occur. On a 3-2 count, Herr would get caught in a rundown and Lombardozzi ran him back to first where Kent Hrbek was standing off the bag near the basepath. Lombardozzi tossed the ball towards Hrbek and the ball sailed past him but into the glove of Viola behind the bag. Viola had come over to take part in the rundown. Herr was hindered by Hrbek returning to the bag, but clearly reached the bag safely before Viola tagged him. However, first base umpire Lee Weyer called Herr out. Weyer&#x27;s view was blocked by Kent Hrbek and, according to the broadcast crew, Viola made the tag late and Hrbek should have been called for obstruction. Had this been called, Herr would have been safe, awarded second base, and the Cardinals would have had a runner at second with one out. It was the third missed call of the game for the normally highly regarded Weyer—often considered one of the best umpires in baseball—-and the fourth of the game total with Phillips’ missed call on Baylor in the 2nd. Two of the four missed calls had direct effects on the score, but they cancelled each other out, as one cost the Twins a run while another led to their scoring a gift run in the 5th. The Herr call did not directly affect the score because on the next pitch, Lindeman flied out to right field to end the 6th inning and Viola also retired the first batter of the following inning. The Twins then took the lead in the bottom of the inning, off Danny Cox, who had relieved Magrane the previous inning. Cox walked Brunansky and Hrbek to lead off, and was replaced by Todd Worrell. As Cox was leaving, he got into an argument with home plate umpire Dave Phillips and was ejected as he was leaving the field. As of 2020, Cox is the last non-manager to be ejected from a World Series game. After retiring the first batter he faced, Worrell walked pinch-hitter Roy Smalley and struck out Dan Gladden for the second out. The next batter, Gagne, reached first on an infield hit as Brunansky scored the go-ahead run.

The Twins&#x27; final run came in the eighth on an RBI double by Dan Gladden off Worrell, who stayed in the rest of the game for the Cardinals. Jeff Reardon retired the side in the ninth to give Minnesota their first World Series victory.

With the victory, Tom Kelly became, at 37, the third youngest manager (and the youngest non-playing manager) to win a World Series. Only John McGraw, who won the 1905 World Series at 32, and Frank Chance, who won the 1907 World Series at 30, are younger.

==Composite box==
1987 World Series (4–3): Minnesota Twins (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
Twins manager Tom Kelly became the youngest non-playing manager to win the World Series since John McGraw in 1905.

By winning in the regulation nine innings, the Twins ensured the 1987 World Series was the first in which no games needed the bottom of the ninth inning. No other World Series since then has had that happen, as the two other Fall Classics in which the home team won every game—1991 and 2001—both included extra inning games and walk-off wins in the bottom of the ninth.

Although Steve Carlton was not on the Twins&#x27; playoff roster, he still attended the White House to be congratulated by President Reagan. While making a photo op with the president, local newspapers listed the names of all of the Minnesota Twins. The only man who wasn&#x27;t listed (and simply identified as a Secret Service agent) was a tall man wearing dark sunglasses in the back. The man in question was Carlton.

After their defeat in the &#x27;87 Series, the Cardinals&#x27; reign of dominance in the &#x27;80s ended. They failed to win their division again until 1996, did not return to the World Series until 2004 and did not win until 2006 in a season where they won two fewer regular season games than the 1987 Twins.

In 1988, the Twins actually won more games than in their championship season, finishing with a 91–71 record. In spite of this improvement, they finished 13 games behind the AL West champion Oakland A&#x27;s, who won 104 games. The Twins eventually sank towards the bottom of the standings, finishing last in 1990. In 1991, the Twins returned to the playoffs by beating the Blue Jays in the ALCS and winning what many call the greatest World Series ever played, over the Atlanta Braves.

The 1987 World Series featured at least two players who went on to win &quot;Manager of the Year&quot; awards. The Twins&#x27; Don Baylor won it in 1995 for his work with the Colorado Rockies while the Cardinals&#x27; Tony Peña won it in 2003 for his efforts with the Kansas City Royals.

The success of the 1987 Twins inspired Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) in &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; to explain why the Twins were the ultimate definition of a team, thus enabling him to win the Dreyer Scholarship. His interview, however, included a factual inaccuracy; he said Gladden hit a grand slam in Game 4, when in fact Gladden hit one in Game 1, and Hrbek hit one in the pivotal Game 6.

Some years after the conclusion of the series it emerged that a lone Metrodome technician had, at his own initiative, tried to influence games on the Twins behalf by adjusting the air conditioning fans while the Twins were at bat. It remains unclear whether this had any effect on game play, or in particular, on games played at the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series.

In a February 2015 interview, sportscaster and author Al Michaels (who, as previously mentioned, did play-by-play for ABC&#x27;s television coverage of the 1987 World Series) alleged the Twins pumped artificial crowd noise into the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. Responding to Michaels&#x27; theory, Twins President Dave St. Peter said that he did not think the Twins needed &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in order to win the World Series. Instead, he argued that &quot;appreciation and respect&quot; should be paid to players like Frank Viola, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, and Kirby Puckett, who, he said, &quot;came out of nowhere to win a championship.&quot;

The 1987 World Series was the final one that ABC aired that went the full seven games. The next time that ABC broadcast a World Series, in 1989, the Oakland Athletics swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. For the final World Series that ABC would broadcast to date, 1995, they split the coverage with NBC. ABC only covered Games 1, 4 and 5, and would have broadcast a seventh game had it been necessary.

As of 2023, this is also the last time where three consecutive World Series went to seven games (1985, 1986, 1987).

<text>USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (C-6/CA-15/CL-15/IX-40) is a protected cruiser that saw service with the United States Navy from her commissioning in 1895 until 1922. She is currently a museum ship in Philadelphia.

&quot;Olympia&quot; became famous as the flagship of Commodore George Dewey during the Battle of Manila Bay in the Spanish–American War in 1898. The ship was decommissioned after returning to the U.S. in 1899, but was returned to active service in 1902. She served until World War I as a training ship for naval cadets and as a floating barracks in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1917, she was mobilized again for war service, patrolling the American coast and escorting transport ships.

After World War I, &quot;Olympia&quot; participated in the 1919 Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and conducted cruises in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas to promote peace in the unstable Balkan countries. In 1921, the ship carried the remains of World War I&#x27;s Unknown Soldier from France to Washington, D.C., where his body was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. &quot;Olympia&quot; was decommissioned for the last time in December 1922 and placed in reserve.

In 1957, the U.S. Navy ceded title to the Cruiser &quot;Olympia&quot; Association, which restored the ship to her 1898 configuration. Since then, &quot;Olympia&quot; has been a museum ship in Philadelphia, where it is now part of the Independence Seaport Museum. &quot;Olympia&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

&quot;Olympia&quot; is the oldest steel American warship still afloat. Repairs, estimated at $10 to 20 million, were desperately needed to keep &quot;Olympia&quot; afloat, and in 2010 the Independence Seaport Museum considered finding a new steward for the ship. By 2014, the museum reversed its plan to find a new steward and soon obtained funding from private donors as well as federal and state agencies to begin work on repairing the ship.

The museum invested in extensive stabilization measures including reinforcing the most deteriorated areas of the hull, expanding the alarm system, installing a network of bilge pumping stand pipes (which will provide greater damage control capability in the unlikely event of a hull breach), extensive deck patching and extensive repair and recoating of the ship&#x27;s rigging. This work was made possible by donations from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the U.S. Cruiser Sailors Association and many individual donors. By 2017, the museum completed the first phase of repairs to the ship and has embarked on an ambitious national campaign to raise the $20 million needed to dry-dock &quot;Olympia&quot; and address waterline deterioration of the hull.

==Background==
When Grover Cleveland first took office in 1885, United States Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney continued the naval modernization program started during the preceding Arthur Administration. U.S. naval policy at the time was focused on commerce raiding, which implied a defensive posture on the part of the United States.

In 1887, Whitney authorized the construction of two coastal defense battleships, that were to become and . The emphasis was still on large and fast commerce-raiding cruisers, capable of destroying an attacking fleet&#x27;s supply line. President Grover Cleveland was defeated in the election of 1888, but before he left office, Whitney managed to have Congress authorize two additional cruisers, one of which was the large, protected cruiser that was to become &quot;Olympia&quot;.

Starting in 1887, the new Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Tracy, began to rethink naval policy. Although Tracy allowed the design and construction of &quot;Olympia&quot; to continue, he was a follower of Alfred Thayer Mahan. As such, Tracy advocated a battle fleet capable of engaging enemy fleets in their home waters. This meant a shift away from large, fast, commerce-raiding cruisers. As a result, &quot;Olympia&quot;, which would probably have been the first in a class of ships, was the only one of her type built.

==Design and construction==
The newly formed Board on the Design of Ships began the design process for Cruiser Number 6 in 1889. For main armament, the board chose guns, though the number and arrangement of these weapons, as well as the armor scheme, was heavily debated. On 8 April 1890, the navy solicited bids but found only one bidder, the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California. The contract specified a cost of $1,796,000, completion by April 1, 1893, and offered a bonus for early completion.

During the contract negotiations, Union Iron Works was granted permission to lengthen the vessel by , at no extra cost, to accommodate the propulsion system. The contract was signed on July 10, 1890, the keel laid on June 17, 1891, and the ship was launched on November 5, 1892. However, delays in the delivery of components, including the new Harvey steel armor, slowed completion. The last one-pounder gun was not delivered until December 1894.

Union Iron Works conducted the first round of trials on November 3, 1893; on a run, the ship achieved a speed of . Upon return to harbor, however, it was discovered that the keel had been fouled by sea grass, which required dry-docking to fix.

By December 11, the work had been completed and she was dispatched from San Francisco to Santa Barbara for an official speed trial. Once in the harbor, heavy fog delayed the ship for four days. On the 15th, &quot;Olympia&quot; sailed into the Santa Barbara Channel, the &quot;chosen race-track for California-built cruisers,&quot; and began a four-hour time trial. According to the navy, she had sustained an average speed of , though she reached up to —both well above the contract requirement of .

While returning to San Francisco, &quot;Olympia&quot; participated in eight experiments that tested various combinations of steering a ship by rudder and propellers. The new cruiser was ultimately commissioned on February 5, 1895. For several months afterwards, she was the largest ship ever built on the western coast of the US, until surpassed by the battleship .

At the time of commissioning, &quot;Scientific American&quot; compared &quot;Olympia&quot; to the similar British s and the Chilean and found that the American ship held a &quot;great superiority&quot; over the British ships. While the &quot;Eclipse&quot;s had of coal, compared to &quot;Olympia&quot;″s , the latter had nearly double the horsepower (making the ship faster), more armor, and a heavier armament on a displacement that was only greater than the other.

===Characteristics===
The ship is in overall length, has a beam of and a draft of . Her design displacement was , with a full combat load of up to displacement. The ship is powered by a pair of vertical triple expansion engines, each supplied with steam from three coal-fired cylindrical boilers. Her engines were rated at with a top speed of , though on trials she achieved and a top speed of .

&quot;Olympia&quot;″s crew numbered between 411 and 447 officers and enlisted.

==== Armament ====
&quot;Olympia&quot; is armed with a variety of weapons. The primary armament was four /35 caliber guns in two twin Mark 6 gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. These guns could fire projectiles, either armor-piercing or high explosive, at a muzzle velocity of per second. The Mark 6 turret was designed for depression of the guns to −4° and elevation to 13°. By 1916, the turrets and guns were considered woefully obsolete, and were subsequently removed and replaced with open gun platforms, each with a single 4&quot;/40. These guns were then later replaced with 5&quot;/51-caliber guns in 1917.

The secondary battery was ten /40 caliber guns mounted in casemates, five on each side of the ship. Each is placed to avoid the flash from the main battery. These guns fired armor-piercing shells at a muzzle velocity of per second. These also were replaced with 5&quot;/51s during the 1917 refit. Fourteen 6-pounder () antitorpedoboat guns are mounted in sponsons. Six one-pounder guns are mounted on deck, along with six above-water torpedo tubes. In 1898 &quot;Olympia&quot; also boasted two Gatling guns and an arsenal of revolvers and rifles.

==== Armor ====
&quot;Olympia&quot;″s conning tower is armored with thick steel plates. The ship has a thick armored deck that slopes on the sides; the slopes increase in thickness to amidships and at the ends. A thick glacis protects the engine rooms. Her main battery turrets are protected by of Harvey armor, while the barbettes upon which they rest have nickel-steel armor. The 5-inch guns are protected by gun shields.

==Service history==
Upon commissioning in February 1895 &quot;Olympia&quot; departed the Union Iron Works yard in San Francisco and steamed inland to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, where outfitting was completed and Captain John J. Read was placed in command. In April, the ship steamed south to Santa Barbara to participate in a festival. The ship&#x27;s crew also conducted landing drills in Sausalito and Santa Cruz that month. On April 20, the ship conducted its first gunnery practice, during which one of the ship&#x27;s gunners, Coxswain John Johnson, was killed in an accident with one of the five-inch guns. The ship&#x27;s last shakedown cruise took place on July 27. After returning to Mare Island, the ship was assigned to replace as the flagship of the Asiatic Squadron.

On August 25, the ship departed the United States for Chinese waters. A week later, the ship arrived in Hawaii, where she remained until October 23 due to an outbreak of cholera. The ship then sailed for Yokohama, Japan, where she arrived on November 9. On November 15, &quot;Baltimore&quot; arrived in Yokohama from Shanghai, China, to transfer command of the Asiatic Squadron to &quot;Olympia&quot;. &quot;Baltimore&quot; departed on December 3; Rear Admiral F.V. McNair arrived fifteen days later to take command of the squadron. The following two years were filled with training exercises with the other members of the Asiatic Squadron, and goodwill visits to various ports in Asia. On January 3, 1898, Commodore George Dewey raised his flag on &quot;Olympia&quot; and assumed command of the squadron.

===Spanish–American War===

As tensions increased and war with Spain became more probable, &quot;Olympia&quot; remained at Hong Kong and was prepared for action. When war was declared on April 25, 1898, Dewey moved his ships to Mirs Bay, China. Two days later, the Navy Department ordered the squadron to Manila in the Philippines, where a significant Spanish naval force protected the harbor. Dewey was ordered to sink or capture the Spanish warships, opening the way for a subsequent conquest by U.S. forces.

====Battle of Manila Bay====

On the morning of May 1, Commodore Dewey—with his flag aboard &quot;Olympia&quot;—steamed his ships into Manila Bay to confront the Spanish flotilla commanded by Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón. The Spanish ships were anchored close to shore, under the protection of coastal artillery, but both the ships and shore batteries were outdated. At approximately 5:40 a.m., Dewey instructed &quot;Olympia&quot;″s captain, &quot;You may fire when you are ready, Gridley&quot;. Gridley ordered the forward eight-inch gun turret, commanded by Lt. Stokely Morgan, to open fire, and the starboard eight-inch gun fired the first shell of the battle at the Spanish flagship Reina Christina, prompting the other American warships to begin firing.

The Spanish ship and shore gunners were significantly less accurate than the Americans, and the battle quickly became one-sided. After initial success, Dewey briefly broke off the engagement at around 7:30 a.m. when his flagship was reported to be low on five-inch ammunition, giving the order to serve a second breakfast to all his ships&#x27; crews. This turned out to be an erroneous report — the five-inch magazines were still mostly full. He ordered the battle resumed shortly after 11:15 that morning. By early afternoon, Dewey had completed the destruction of Montojo&#x27;s squadron and the shore batteries, while his own ships were largely undamaged. Dewey anchored his ships off Manila and accepted the surrender of the city.

Word of Dewey&#x27;s victory quickly reached the US; both he and &quot;Olympia&quot; became famous as the first victors of the war. An expeditionary force was assembled and sent to complete the conquest of the Philippines. &quot;Olympia&quot; remained in the area and supported the Army by shelling Spanish forces on land. She returned to the Chinese coast on May 20, 1899. She remained there until the following month, when she departed for the United States, via the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Along the way back to the United States, the ship sought to project the United States&#x27; new global standing as a world power after the victory. Frances Benjamin Johnston was enlisted to take images of George Dewey and men in the United States Navy upon the ship. She boarded the ship on August 5, 1899. The photos presented the daily life of American men on the ship and were meant to magnify American imperialism in a positive light. The ship arrived in Boston October 10. Following &quot;Olympia&quot;″s return to the United States, her officers and crew were feted, and she was herself repainted and adorned with a gilded bow ornament. On November 9, &quot;Olympia&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

===Before World War I===
&quot;Olympia&quot; was recommissioned into the fleet in January 1902 and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron. Her first duty was to serve as the flagship of the Caribbean Division. Over the following four years, the ship patrolled the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea; her voyages included a visit to the Ottoman Empire. During March through April 1903 she and four other U.S. Navy warships were involved in an intervention in Honduras.

Starting on April 2, 1906, she became a training ship for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy. In this role, she conducted three summer training cruises: May 15 to August 26, 1907, June 1 to September 1, 1908, and May 14 to August 28, 1909. Between the cruises, the ship was placed in reserve, first in Norfolk, Virginia and later at Annapolis, Maryland. On March 6, 1912, &quot;Olympia&quot; arrived in Charleston, South Carolina. There she served as a barracks ship until 1916. In late 1916, the ship was recommissioned into the fleet, when it became increasingly clear that the U.S. would eventually enter World War I.

===World War I===

After the U.S. entered the First World War by declaring war on Germany in April 1917, &quot;Olympia&quot; was mobilized as the flagship of the U.S. Patrol Force. She was assigned to patrol the eastern seaboard of the U.S. for German warships. She also escorted transport ships in the North Atlantic. On June 15, 1917, she ran aground in Long Island Sound, and she put in for repairs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, along with the replacement of her eight-inch and 5&quot;/40-caliber guns with 5&quot;/51-caliber guns, which took eight months, but a July, 1917 article about 
hitting the rocks says her original armament of four eight-inch and ten five-inch guns had been replaced by twelve five-inch guns &quot;a few years ago.&quot; &quot;Olympia&quot; departed Charleston on April 28, 1918 carrying an expeditionary force bound for Russia. Russia, which had previously been a member of the Allied Powers, was in the midst of civil war and had signed a separate peace with Germany. On June 9, 1918, the ship arrived in Murmansk, Russia, and deployed the peacekeeping force. She subsequently assisted in the occupation of Archangel against Bolshevik forces.

After the end of the war, &quot;Olympia&quot; sailed to the Mediterranean via Portsmouth, England. In December 1918, the ship became the flagship for American naval forces stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. While on this assignment, she continued in her old role of showing the flag and conducting goodwill visits in various Mediterranean ports. This included a period of policing duty in the Adriatic Sea from January 21 to October 25, 1919; the Dalmatian coast was in a state of turmoil following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the war. On April 1, 1919, she was in Spalato, now Split, with and . On August 18, she steamed to the Black Sea to aid the return of refugees from the Balkans who had fled during the war. She was back in the Adriatic Sea by September 19, and four days later had to deploy a landing party to prevent an incident between Italian and Yugoslavian forces.

&quot;Olympia&quot; briefly returned to Charleston on November 24, 1919. The following year, she was reclassified CA-15. She then prepared for another tour of duty in the Adriatic, departing from New York on February 14, 1920. This was concluded on May 25, 1921, when the ship returned to Charleston. A month after her arrival she was made the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s training unit. She then participated in joint Army-Navy experiments in July, during which the former German warships and were sunk off the Virginia Capes. She was again reclassified as CL-15 that year.

===Unknown Soldier===
On October 3, 1921, &quot;Olympia&quot; departed Philadelphia for Le Havre, France, to bring the remains of the Unknown Soldier home for interment in Arlington National Cemetery. On October 25, 1921 there was a dockside ceremony where the casket, which had been selected on the previous day, arrived by train from Paris and was handed over by the Army to a bearer party of sailors and marines who carried it on board with all honors. &quot;Olympia&quot; received a 17-gun salute as she departed, escorted by and a group of eight French destroyers for part of the voyage. The casket did not fit below deck, so it was lashed to the weather deck and covered in canvas. During the crossing &quot;Olympia&quot; encountered the fifth tropical cyclone of the 1921 Atlantic hurricane season. Increased coal consumption during the storm lightened the ship, exacerbating its tendency to roll. Later in the crossing &quot;Olympia&quot; encountered the remnants of the 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane. At the mouth of the Potomac river on November 9, the battleship and the destroyer joined &quot;Olympia&quot; as she steamed to the Washington Navy Yard. After transferring the remains ashore, the cruiser fired her guns in salute. She conducted a last training cruise for midshipmen in the summer of 1922.

==Preservation==
On December 9, 1922, she was decommissioned for the last time in Philadelphia and placed in reserve. On June 30, 1931, the ship was reclassified IX-40, to be preserved as a relic.

On September 11, 1957, she was released to the Cruiser Olympia Association, restored to her 1898 configuration and became a museum ship under their auspices. The main eight-inch guns and turrets, scrapped before World War I, were replaced with sheet metal fabrications. In January 1996, when faced with mounting debt and tremendous deferred maintenances, the Cruiser Olympia Society merged with the Independence Seaport Museum (ISM) in Philadelphia.

Today, &quot;Olympia&quot; is a museum at the ISM, at Penn&#x27;s Landing in Philadelphia. She is the sole floating survivor of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Spanish–American War fleet. Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Midshipmen from Villanova University and the University of Pennsylvania regularly work on &quot;Olympia&quot;, functioning as maintenance crew. &quot;Olympia&#x27;s&quot; stern plate and bow ornaments are on display at Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy. Her anchor is also on display on the grounds of Norwich University, representing all Norwich graduates who have served in the Naval Service and Dewey&#x27;s education at Norwich.

Historic steel-hulled ships should be drydocked for maintenance every 20 years, but &quot;Olympia&quot; has been in the water continuously since 1945. Essential repairs were estimated at $10 million. Initially, plans to scuttle &quot;Olympia&quot;, making her into an artificial reef, were under consideration by the Museum, soon overruled. Plans were made to close &quot;Olympia&quot; to visitors on 22 November 2010, due a lack of operating funds. These plans were scrapped, and ISM agreed to keep the ship open with regular hours through 31 December, and then reduced hours through March 31, 2011. The U.S. Navy expressed its willingness to let the museum &quot;responsibly dispose&quot; of the vessel which could have resulted in the ship being transferred, sold as scrap, or sunk as a reef. As such, the museum held a summit in early 2011 with the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, National Park Service, and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission to determine what steps could be taken to save the cruiser.

As a result of the summit, the ISM searched for another nonprofit organization to assume stewardship of &quot;Olympia&quot; to provide for her maintenance and restoration. On March 6, 2011, the ISM published a Transfer Application (TAPP) similar to a Request for Proposals. Those who qualified to apply for the TAPP include domestic governmental organizations and not-for-profit organizations with valid 501(c)(3) (charitable) IRS status. Several organizations from the East, Gulf and West Coasts submitted applications to preserve and display &quot;Olympia&quot;. Only four were found to be acceptable, from Pennsylvania, California, South Carolina and Washington DC. On May 7, 2011, the National Trust for Historic Preservation set up a national donation repository to allow donations received through it to be used directly for the much-needed temporary and future hull repairs. The ISM, although originally committed to giving up the vessel, will manage any repair work undertaken, should funds become available.

In April 2014, the ISM announced the end of the TAPP process as it could not find an organization that could present a viable, long-term solution for the ship. &quot;Olympia&quot; will remain in Philadelphia and the ISM plans to launch a $20 million national fundraising campaign for her long-term preservation.

=== Preservation projects: 2014–present ===
The ISM has renewed its commitment to restoring the vessel and has engaged in several preservation projects which were funded in large part by grants from the National Park Service, the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission, the Jennifer Pritzker&#x27;s Tawani Foundation and Herman S. Pollock Foundation, as well as private donations. Over the past several decades, the Museum invested over $10 million to maintain &quot;Olympia.&quot; Some of the most notable repairs to the cruiser before 2014 include removing 30 tons of asbestos and other contaminants, conducting safety upgrades, and drafting the necessary engineering and planning work.

In 2015 &quot;Olympia&quot; received multiple grants including $169,850.00 from the National Park Service&#x27;s Maritime Heritage Program to continue work on interim repairs of deteriorating hull plates and deck leaks. Between April and August 2015, four 4-foot by 7-foot sections of the hull at the waterline were cleaned, scaled to bare metal, and treated with ceramic epoxy, and new bottom paint. This was accomplished using a custom-made mobile surface-piercing cofferdam. In 2017, the Museum replaced &quot;Olympia&#x27;s&quot; old gangways for easier and safer access, restored the signal bridge, restored the Admiral and Captain&#x27;s skylights, and constructed replicas of historic benches, mess lockers and mess tables.

In 2017, the Museum announced that it would embark on a major national fundraising campaign to raise $20 million to drydock the vessel so that the hull can finally be fully repaired. The restoration efforts are part of a larger plan to make the vessel more accessible and to educate the public about the cultural and historic significance of &quot;Olympia.&quot; In May 2017, the Independence Seaport announced a semi-permanent exhibit featuring &quot;Olympia,&quot; entitled &quot;World War I USS Olympia,&quot; opening on June 16, 2017.

<text>TVB Jade (), or simply Jade, is a Hong Kong Cantonese-language free-to-air television channel owned and operated by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) as its flagship service, alongside its sister network, the English-language TVB Pearl. Broadcasting started on 19 November 1967. It is headquartered at TVB City at the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate in Tseung Kwan O, in the Sai Kung District. Primarily broadcasting entertainment programming, TVB Jade has historically been the most dominant television channel in the region in terms of viewership, with its closest competitor having been the now-defunct ATV Home.

Jade primarily broadcasts in the Cantonese language; it has also offered programs with alternative audio tracks in Mandarin, English, and other foreign languages. Some shows also offer subtitles in multiple languages.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of TVB Jade, TVB, to be &quot;Captured Private Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Audience==
During the 21:30 to 22:30 weekday time-slot, TVB Jade consistently attains the highest television audience ratings in Hong Kong. Which in the 90s, With an average of a &#x27;32&#x27; ratings point in that time-slot, it is watched by more than 80% of the TV audience in Hong Kong.

==Digital broadcasting==
TVB Jade was launched on DTMB digital terrestrial television on 31 December 2007, using digital virtual channel 81.

==Overseas broadcasting==

===Mainland China===
Due to the needs of reform and opening up, TVB Jade was broadcast by some cable providers in Guangdong in the 1990s, and officially obtained the right to broadcast legally in Guangdong Province in September 2004. After ATV Home stopped broadcasting, TVB Jade became the only overseas Cantonese TV channel that could legally broadcast in Guangdong Province.

Some programmes broadcast on TVB Jade will be censored by Guangdong authorities (like some pre-2020 RTHK-produced political and current affairs programmes, &quot;sensitive&quot; news clips, or TVB dramas that was banned by the mainland authorities) and they will insert some entertainment programmes, their own advertisements or Hong Kong Government&#x27;s promotional clips instead.

During the &quot;National Day of Mourning&quot;, access to TVB channels (Jade and Pearl) was blocked and some cable providers in Guangdong switched their Jade and Pearl feeds to CCTV-1, but Guangdong Cable only blocked Jade&#x27;s and Pearl&#x27;s entertainment programmes and advertisements.

<doc id="992582" wikidata="Q362406" url="?curid=992582" title="Ronnie Drew">
<text>Joseph Ronald Drew (16 September 1934 – 16 August 2008) was an Irish singer, folk musician and actor who had a fifty-year career recording with The Dubliners.

He sang lead vocals on the singles &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot; and &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;, which both charted in the UK top 10 and were performed on &quot;TOTP&quot;. His voice was once described by Nathan Joseph as being &quot;like the sound of coke being crushed under a door&quot;.

==Early life==
Ronnie Drew was born in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin in 1934. Although he was so intimately associated with being &quot;a Dubliner&quot;, he would sometimes say, &quot;I was born and grew up in Dún Laoghaire, and no true Dubliner would accept that at all!&quot;, a quip that Andy Irvine relayed in his song &quot;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&quot;.

Drew was educated at CBS Eblana and used to &quot;mitch&quot; and cycle up to Leopardstown Racecourse.

Drew was a Roman Catholic, and when asked in an interview with RTÉ about his faith, he stated that although he was a practicing Catholic, he didn&#x27;t agree with the church establishment and its greed.

Drew had also sung as a boy soprano before his voice broke.

==Career==
In the 1950s, Drew moved to Spain to teach English and learn Spanish and flamenco guitar. His interest in folk music began at the age of 19. When he returned to Ireland, he performed in the Gate Theatre with John Molloy and soon went into the music business full-time, after holding a number of short-term jobs—including one at Dublin&#x27;s telephone exchange. 

In 1962, he founded the Ronnie Drew Group with Luke Kelly, Barney McKenna and Ciarán Bourke. They soon changed their name to The Dubliners—with John Sheahan joining shortly afterwards to form the definitive line-up—and quickly became one of the best known Irish folk groups. They played at first in O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s Pub in Merrion Row, Dublin 2 where they were often accompanied by Mary Jordan on the spoons and vocalist Ann Mulqueen, a friend of McKenna&#x27;s. Mary Jordan&#x27;s mother, Peggy Jordan, introduced them to the Abbey Tavern in Howth, which became a regular Monday night venue for the emerging group. They also played across the road in the Royal Hotel, at all-night parties in Peggy&#x27;s large house in Kenilworth Square in Rathgar, and in John Molloy&#x27;s flat at Ely Place.

Drew left the Dubliners in 1974. He rejoined in 1979, but then left for good in 1995, though he did reunite with the group in 2002 for a 40th anniversary celebration. He made several television appearances with the group between 2002 and 2005.

From 1995 onwards, Drew pursued a solo career. He recorded with many artists, including Christy Moore, The Pogues, Antonio Breschi, Dropkick Murphys, Eleanor Shanley and others. He did a number of &quot;one-man shows&quot;—he was accompanied by various guitarists—during this period, such as &quot;Songs and Stories&quot;, &quot;Ronnie, I Hardly Knew Ya&quot; and &quot;Ronnie&quot;. These shows consisted of stories about people such as Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and Seán O&#x27;Casey, as well as Drew singing their songs.

He fronted a campaign to encourage the use of Dublin&#x27;s light-rail infrastructure (the DART) and, before that, the &quot;My Dublin&quot; ads for radio stations 98FM and FM104. He narrated a retelling of the great Irish Myths and Legends—scripted by Steven Byrne—over a six CD set in 2006. He also narrated the stories of Oscar Wilde in his distinctive voice for a series released on CD by the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper. Both were re-released as CD box sets in 2010.
On 22 August 2006, Drew was honoured in a ceremony where his hand prints were added to the &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; outside Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre.

==Declining health and death==
In September 2006, Drew was reported to be in ill health after being admitted to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Dublin, to undergo tests for suspected cancer. The &quot;Evening Herald&quot; reported that his apparent illness was due to years of heavy drinking. However, according to a fan site dedicated to The Dubliners, it was reported that he was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. Drew had been a teetotaler for a number of years, with an occasional relapse, but he remained a regular smoker.

He appeared on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on 15 December 2006 along with Phil Coulter, where he discussed his recent health scares.

Despite his failing health, he was featured on an album entitled &quot;Pearls&quot;—produced by Niall Austin—with work he did with Jah Wobble.

His wife of more than 40 years, Deirdre Drew (née McCartan, daughter of Patrick McCartan), died on 7 June 2007 at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, just one day before he was scheduled to return to performing live at the &quot;Legends of Irish Folk&quot; concert, which also featured Johnny McEvoy, Ralph McTell and Finbar Furey.

On 25 October 2007, Drew—now bald and beardless—appeared on &quot;Ryan Confidential&quot; on RTÉ 1 to give an interview about his role in The Dubliners, his life since leaving the band and being diagnosed with throat cancer. Later in 2007, he again appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, where he spoke some more about the death of his wife and his ongoing treatment for cancer.

Drew died in St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Dublin, on 16 August 2008, following his long illness. He was buried three days later in Redford Cemetery in Greystones.

==Tributes==

===&quot;The Ballad of Ronnie Drew&quot;===
On 19 February 2008, a song was released called &quot;The Ballad of Ronnie Drew&quot; performed by a number of famous Irish musicians or musicians living in Ireland. This included members of The Dubliners, U2, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Christy Dignam of Aslan, Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, Kíla, Christy Moore, Andrea Corr, Moya Brennan, Shane MacGowan, Liam Ó Maonlaí, Bob Geldof, Damien Dempsey, Gavin Friday, Iona Green, Jerry Fish, Paul Brady, Paddy Casey, Mick Pyro, Mundy, Chris de Burgh, Ronan Keating, Jack L, Eleanor Shanley, Mary Black, Declan O&#x27;Rourke, Mary Coughlan, and Joe Elliott of Def Leppard and The Chieftains.

Originally, the song had been written to include Drew himself but was changed into a tribute to him as his health was declining. Proceeds from sale of the single went to the Irish Cancer Society, at Drew&#x27;s request. The song was also performed live on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on 22 February with Drew in attendance as an audience member, and entered the Irish Singles Charts at No. 2. 

===&quot;September Song&quot;===
Also in 2008, RTÉ broadcast a documentary on Drew in May – as part of its &quot;Arts Lives&quot; series. Called &quot;September Song&quot;, it featured Drew&#x27;s recollections of growing up in his grandmother&#x27;s house in Dún Laoghaire, the foundation of The Dubliners in O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s pub on Merrion Row, the days spent touring the world, the loss of his wife, and his own battle with cancer. Interviewed in &quot;September Song&quot; are his son Phelim, his daughter Cliodhna, plus friends and fans such as Bono, Billy Connolly and Damien Dempsey. 

&quot;September Song&quot; was produced by Oscar-nominated producer Noel Pearson and directed by Sinead O&#x27;Brien. The name of the documentary comes from Drew&#x27;s recording of &quot;September Song&quot;—the Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson song made popular through recordings by a number of artists, including Frank Sinatra—which features on his 2006 solo album, &quot;There&#x27;s Life in the Old Dog Yet&quot;. 

===Other tributes===
Andy Irvine mentioned Drew in the song &quot;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&quot; he recorded with his band Mozaik on the album &quot;Changing Trains&quot;, and again on the live album &quot;Andy Irvine/70th Birthday Concert at Vicar St 2012&quot;.

The Tossers, a Chicago-based celtic punk band, dedicated their album &quot;On a Fine Spring Evening&quot; to his memory. Their song &quot;St. Stephen&#x27;s Day&quot; includes the line &quot;I could go on up to Wicklow and throw a rose on Ronnie&#x27;s grave&quot;.

Flogging Molly lead singer David King listed Drew as one of the greatest losses of a musician, in recent years, calling him &quot;A REAL folk singer.&quot; at a show in Moscow, Idaho.

Gaelic Storm named Drew on the song &quot;I Was Raised on Black and Tans&quot; from their 2010 album &quot;Cabbage&quot;. &quot;I was raised on black and tans...on Ronnie Drew and Van the Man&quot; is a line from the song.

Dropkick Murphys, a Celtic punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, dedicated the song &quot;(F)lannigan&#x27;s Ball&quot; to Drew during their set at the Reading Festival in 2008. The Pogues&#x27; Spider Stacy joined the band for this song. Stacy and Drew were featured as guest vocalists on the studio recording of the song, one of the last Drew recorded before his death.

Australian-Irish folk punk band The Rumjacks from Australia name-checks Drew in their hit song &quot;An Irish Pub Song&quot; about the ailing quality of some Irish pubs. &quot;It&#x27;s over to me, and over to you! We&#x27;ll skip along the avenue, and who the hell is Ronnie Drew? We got us an Irish pub!&quot;

==&quot;The Last Session: A Fond Farewell&quot;==
In the final months before his death, Drew recorded a number of songs in a traditional jazz style. A number of stars from the music world, including Mary Coughlan and Damien Dempsey, joined him in duets on the album. It was produced by Hugh Buckley and released in November 2008 by Celtic Collections.

==Legacy==
Mary McAleese, then President of Ireland, said Drew had brought great pleasure to people at home and abroad and had re-energised and refreshened Ireland&#x27;s unique musical heritage; Taoiseach Brian Cowen also described him as &quot;iconic&quot;.

<text>NGC 381 is an open cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia, located at a distance of approximately from the Sun. Credit for the discovery of this cluster was given to Caroline Herschel by her brother William in 1787, although she may never have actually seen it.

This is a Trumpler class cluster of intermediate age, estimated at 316 million years. This class indicates the cluster is relatively weakly concentrated, with a small brightness range and an intermediate richness of stars. A total of 350 probable members have been identified, down to 20th magnitude, and the cluster contains about 32 times the mass of the Sun. The cluster has a core angular radius of and an outer cluster radius of . It has a physical tidal radius of . No giant stars have been discovered in this cluster. Four candidate variable stars have been found in the field of NGC 381; one of which is a suspected cluster member. The eclipsing binary OX Cassiopeiae was once thought to be a member, but is now known to be a background star system.

<text>Synodontis nigriventris, the blotched upside-down catfish, is a species of upside-down catfish native to the Congo Basin of Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.

==Appearance and anatomy==
Blotched upside-down catfish are small, reaching a maximum of SL. Like other members of the family Mochokidae, they have large eyes, a large dorsal fin and three pair of barbels. These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish&#x27;s pigmentation – their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading. These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down.

==Ecology and behaviour==
&quot;Synodontis nigriventris&quot; are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. These fish lay eggs. The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old. Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down. When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object. It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface. By swimming upside down when it feeds, it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath.

==In the aquarium==
The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10 cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.

<text>Joshua Quagmire (sometimes shortened to JQ) (1953-2023) was an American cartoonist of underground and mainstream comic books, best known for his creation Cutey Bunny. His comic book work also overlapped with and contributed to the early furry fandom during the 1980s and early 1990s.

==Biography==
Joshua Quagmire (the name is a pseudonym) was raised in the Los Angeles area, though he has remarked that his grandfather served in the Canadian Forces in World War I; Quagmire has dedicated a story, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Tommy&quot;, to his grandfather. On the few occasions he has drawn himself into a story, he has not shown his own face. He is a frequent guest at the San Diego Comic Convention.

His most enduring work has been the comic &quot;Cutey Bunny&quot;, which was first published in 1982. Cutey Bunny, a furry superheroine and a pastiche of Go Nagai&#x27;s Cutey Honey, appeared in the self-produced underground comic &quot;Army Surplus Komikz&quot; from 1982 to 1985 as well as in Cerebus&#x27; Unique Story section. The story, writing, and art style recall not only manga, but the madcap &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; and syndicated comic strips of the 1940s and 1950s, together with a burlesque sense of both humor and sexuality. Quagmire uses an &quot;ensemble cast&quot; of characters who will tend to show up no matter what the situation or genre; along with Cutey, they include:

* Vicky Feldhyser, a sadomasochistic switch lesbian fox and sometimes-rival secret agent to Cutey, whom she lusts after
* Taffy, Cutey&#x27;s little sister
* Fatty Tubbins, a cat, and Cutey&#x27;s friend and companion (who is also frequently credited as Quagmire&#x27;s inker)
* The Space Gophers, a quintet (or sometimes more) of not exceptionally bright interplanetary-traveling gophers, all of whom are named &quot;Al&quot;
* Pandora, a Scottish-brogued female robot who travels with the Gophers
* Gran&#x27;ma Phooby, Cutey&#x27;s &quot;grandmother&quot;, of indeterminate species and dreadful cooking skill
* Heidi and Etsuko, a pair of German and Japanese (respectively) scantily clad female elves, typically involved in some nefarious espionage plot
* The Purple Puffle, an odd creature who appears mainly as a background ornament

In 1985, the comic was nearly picked up for publishing by Aardvark-Vanaheim, but the deal fell through and Quagmire continued to self-publish.

There are a few projects which Quagmire has done outside this ensemble, such as the more serious CyberFox or the more overtly sexual Bronco Bunny.

Quagmire is also fond of introducing caricatures of real personalities to his comics. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, in character as they were in the popular &quot;Road to...&quot; movies, frequently appear to help Cutey Bunny. A frequent adversary is &quot;Uncle Joe&quot;—quite obviously Joseph Stalin—and his marionette henchman, &quot;Howdy Ivan&quot;. And Cutey, as an American secret agent, is often shown taking orders from a doddering Ronald Reagan or a sinister George H. W. Bush. Even fellow comic book writer Chris Claremont appeared in one issue, helping unmask a villain who turned out to be Adolf Hitler in disguise.

Although politics was never taboo in Quagmire&#x27;s comics, they have been more emphasized in his recent works. Typically, he has been even-handed in his treatment—he recounts the tale of a socialist friend of his, who, upon reading an Uncle Joe story, could not determine whether it was for or against socialism and said that it seemed to be &quot;anti-every ideology&quot;. However, Quagmire has become more pointed in his criticism of George W. Bush and other contemporary leaders based on Quagmire&#x27;s opposition to war and the current state of world economics and the environment. For example, in a 2004 story, Heidi and Etsuko join the Department of Homeland Security, and are dispatched to the Middle East to search for weapons of mass destruction—and remove the stickers on them which read &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot; However, they succeed only in finding weapons in practically every country in the area &quot;except&quot; Iraq.

Josh Quagmire&#x27;s last online project was a comic called &quot;Bunz &amp; Katz&quot; which began running in 2012. The strip is about two alien scouts, Bunz - an alien who has been altered to look like an anime &quot;sailor chick&quot; so as to blend in with &quot;Dirt&#x27;s&quot; defenders, and her henchbot Katz. Sent to Earth by the all conquering but now hopelessly obsolete and ancient NegaFleet, the two hapless protagonists attempt to prepare the way for Earth&#x27;s destruction but things just never seem to work out for them. Their interactions with the inhabitants of &quot;Dirt&quot; (as Katz translated &quot;Earth&quot;) and their ignorance of Earthly ways make up the majority of the humor along with occasional asides into popular cultural events or politics. The last instalment was posted on May 25, 2023. 

Quagmire died in May 2023.

<text>Togo Dennis West Jr. (June 21, 1942 – March 8, 2018) was an American attorney and public official. A Democrat, he was the third person to occupy the post of Secretary of Veterans Affairs during the Bill Clinton administration serving from 1998 until his resignation in 2000. He was the second African American to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

==Early life==
West was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he became an Eagle Scout with Bronze Palms, and attended Atkins High School (where his parents were teachers), graduating as valedictorian in June 1960.

He subsequently entered Howard University, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1965. He received his Juris Doctor degree from the Howard University School of Law in 1968, receiving &quot;cum laude&quot; honors and graduating first in his class.

While a freshman at Howard University, he became a brother of Zeta Phi chapter of Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity. West was a member of the Kappa Psi chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

==Early career==
While a law student at Howard, West became the managing editor for the &quot;Howard Law Journal&quot;. Around that time, he met Gail Berry, who later became his wife.

A member of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square, he served as a vestryman and Senior Warden.

West was a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America, the organization&#x27;s governing body. He was named a Distinguished Eagle Scout by the Boy Scouts of America and was awarded the Silver Buffalo Award for his national contributions to America&#x27;s youth. He previously served as the president of the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

==Military and government career==
After completing law school and clerking for federal District Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., West entered the United States Army. He was in the Army Field Artillery Corps from 1965 to 1968, then attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia. He entered U.S. Army JAG Corps, and he served as an Army lawyer from 1969 to 1973.

From his military service, he earned the Legion of Merit and the Meritorious Service Medal. He subsequently practiced law at the firm of Covington &amp; Burling before being appointed an associate deputy attorney general in the administration of President Gerald Ford.

West held several posts in the administration of Jimmy Carter: General Counsel of the Navy (1977–79), Special Assistant to the Secretary and to the Deputy Secretary of Defense (1979), and General Counsel of the Department of Defense (1980–81). As the Secretary of the Army, West weighed in on the Aberdeen scandal, prompting stricter enforcement and investigation into the Army&#x27;s sexual harassment policies.

West returned to private practice in 1981 with the firm of Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler and later worked as senior vice president for government relations of the Northrop Corporation until he became a member of the Clinton administration. In 1996, as Secretary of the Army, West earned the Grand-Officer of the Order of Military Merit by the Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

West was nominated by President Bill Clinton on January 27, 1998, during Clinton&#x27;s second term, and was confirmed by the Senate on May 4, 1998. He had previously served as Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1998. From January 2, 1998, through May 4, 1998, he served a dual role as Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of the Army while awaiting confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

== Post-government career ==
After leaving office, West practiced law and served on the boards of various institutions. From 2004 to 2006, he served as president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank focused on issues of concern to minorities. He was a strong supporter of and past board member of the Mount Vernon preservation society.

West and former Chief of Naval Operations retired admiral Vernon Clark led the Defense Department&#x27;s investigation into the Fort Hood massacre, issuing a report in January 2010.

West died of a heart attack on March 8, 2018, at the age of 75, while on a cruise between Barbados and Puerto Rico. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on April 26, 2018.

<doc id="992600" wikidata="Q334418" url="?curid=992600" title="William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt">
<text>William Allen Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt, (15 April 1885 – 16 August 1957) was a British Liberal Party, National Labour and then Labour Party politician and lawyer who served as Lord Chancellor under Clement Attlee from 1945 to 1951.

==Background and education==
He was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the son of Reverend William Jowitt, Rector of Stevenage, by his wife Louisa Margaret Allen.

At the age of nine, he was sent to Northaw Place, a preparatory school in Potters Bar, Middlesex, where he first met and was looked after by fellow student Clement Attlee, the future Labour Party Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

From Northaw, he went to Marlborough College, then to New College, Oxford where he studied law. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 15 November 1906 and was called to the Bar on 23 June 1909.

==Legal and political career (1922–1931)==

Jowitt became a member of chambers in Brick Court in London. He proved himself a skilled advocate, attracting attention for his subdued and charming manner when barristers were more inclined to browbeat witnesses. He became a King&#x27;s Counsel the day before the 1922 general election in which he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for The Hartlepools. Jowitt was a member of the faction of the Liberal Party led by H. H. Asquith and somewhat radical in his beliefs. He continued to practise law whilst a backbench MP and was not considered a great orator in the House of Commons.

Jowitt was re-elected, now part of the re-united Liberal Party, at the 1923 general election, and in 1924, he was a member of the Royal Commission on Lunacy. He lost his seat in the 1924 general election. Jowitt stood successfully in Preston in the 1929 general election, again elected as a Liberal. Following the formation of a minority Labour government, he was offered the position of attorney general by the new prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald.

Labour had few experienced lawyers in its ranks in Parliament and had experienced problems filling the positions of legal officers in its first government. Jowitt agreed, but resigned his seat and stood again as a candidate for the Labour Party. At the by-election in July 1929, Preston re-elected him with an increased majority. As was customary, Jowitt received a knighthood upon becoming attorney general. His work mainly concerned the drafting of government bills, particularly the reversal of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927.

As was still the custom for the attorney general, he occasionally prosecuted in high-profile cases, notably Sidney Harry Fox, charged with murdering his mother by suffocating her and then setting fire to her hotel room. It was said that a single question from Jowitt (&quot;Explain to me why you shut the door?&quot;) sealed Fox&#x27;s fate since Fox could think of no convincing answer.

==Divided loyalties (1931–1939)==
When the Labour government split over the financial crisis in 1931, Jowitt was one of only a handful of Labour MPs to follow MacDonald into the National Government. He was uncomfortable in a coalition with the Conservatives but believed that the proposed spending cuts causing the split were necessary, and the coalition was necessary to force them through. Like others who joined the National Government, he was expelled from the Labour Party.

He was made a Privy Councillor but found himself in a difficult electoral position when he could not secure the withdrawal of the Conservative candidate in Preston in the 1931 general election. He thus stood instead as the National Labour candidate for the Combined English Universities, but there too, he competed with other candidates supporting the National Government and was defeated. MacDonald persuaded Jowitt to remain as Attorney General in the hope that a new seat could be found to maintain the handful of National Labour positions in the government, but that proved impossible and Jowitt stepped down. He was replaced as Attorney General in January 1932 and returned to the Bar. Though relatively new to the party, Jowitt greatly regretted the split with Labour. He remained close to MacDonald, but after Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in 1935, Jowitt began campaigning for Labour.

A number of constituency Labour Parties attempted to nominate him as their candidate for the general election that year, but he was still expelled. Unable to stand for Labour, he refused to stand for any other party or as an independent.

Jowitt was readmitted to the Labour Party in November 1936. Still a public figure, he was a critic of the National Government&#x27;s policy of appeasement, and in 1937, he called for the state control of the arms industry and rapid rearmament to face the growing threat of fascism on the Continent.

In February 1939 he called for the recreation of the Ministry of Munitions. In October, he was adopted as Labour&#x27;s candidate at a by-election in Ashton-under-Lyne and was elected unopposed, due to the war-time electoral pact.

==Churchill ministry (1940–1945)==

Eight months later, Winston Churchill appointed Jowitt as Solicitor General in his coalition government. Jowitt dispensed legal advice to the government for two years in World War II before he was placed in charge of planning for reconstruction. He also held Cabinet positions that were mostly sinecures such as Paymaster General and then Minister without Portfolio in that role.

In 1944, he became Minister of National Insurance at the head of a new government department. He resigned from the government when Labour left the coalition in May 1945, after Victory in Europe Day, and he was re-elected for Ashton-under-Lyne in the general election in July.

==Lord Chancellor (1945–1951)==
After a landslide victory in the 1945 election, Labour formed its first majority government. Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Jowitt as Lord Chancellor. As soon as he was appointed, Jowitt met with US Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson to resolve outstanding points of contention over the draft London Charter, which would govern the procedures of the Nuremberg Trials. He retained the Conservative MP and outgoing Attorney General, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, as the official liaison but indicated that the new Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, would serve as Britain&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor in the trials themselves.

Jowitt introduced and saw signed the United Nations Act 1946, the legislation that governs how the UK subordinates itself to the UN.

He was raised to the peerage as Baron Jowitt, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford, on 2 August 1945 and entered the House of Lords. He led much important judicial legislation during the life of the Labour government.

Jowitt was also responsible for some key changes to the legal culture in Britain. He attempted to end political and social imbalances in the Magistrates Courts and is considered to have been the first Lord Chancellor to adopt a policy of appointing judges purely on the basis of merit.

As Lord Chancellor, he also served as speaker of the House of Lords, a delicate job given the Conservative majority in the Lords. Christopher Addison, Labour&#x27;s leader in the Lords, died shortly after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1951 general election.

Labour was now in opposition, and Jowitt took over as leader of the Labour peers. He was created Viscount Jowitt, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford, on 20 January 1947, and was awarded an earldom by Attlee in the 1951 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, being created Viscount Stevenage, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford and Earl Jowitt on 24 January 1952.

==Later political life==
A senior figure in the party, and a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Jowitt was careful to keep the Labour peers out of the conflict between the Bevanites and Gaitskellites in the early 1950s. The opposition to the Conservative government in the Lords was meagre but sometimes successfully rallied support from government backbenchers.

In 1955, for instance, Jowitt led a successful rebellion in the Lords over a government bill to criminalise the medical use of marijuana. Jowitt was a prominent spokesperson against human rights abuses during the suppression of the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, teaming up with the Archbishop of Canterbury to launch a review of the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Colonel Arthur Young as Commissioner of Police in the colony. He stood down as leader in November 1955, at the age of 70.

==Family==

Jowitt married Lesley McIntyre, a daughter of James Patrick McIntyre, in 1913. He died at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in August 1957, aged 72. His peerages did not survive his death, as he had no male heirs.

==Publications==
Jowitt wrote two books on espionage and compiled a legal dictionary, which was published posthumously in 1959, completed by Clifford Walsh, and became a standard reference work. It remains in print as &quot;Jowitt&#x27;s Dictionary of English Law&quot;.

<text>Nebo School District is a public school district that serves the southern part of Utah County.

==Description==

The district covers more than 1,300 square miles. It is named for nearby Mount Nebo, the tallest peak in the Wasatch Range. The district borders the Alpine, Provo City, Wasatch County, North Sanpete, Juab, and Tintic School Districts.

With over 42,000 students, Nebo is the 7th largest school district in Utah. The district operates thirty-one elementary schools (grades K–5), five middle schools (grades 6–7), five junior high schools (grades 8–9), and six high schools (grades 10–12). It also operates various alternative-education programs.
==High schools==
===Maple Mountain High===
===Payson High===
:Established in 1912, the current building was finished in 1967, with a new building announced for 2023. The student body comes from Payson, as well as from a number of nearby communities such as Santaquin, Goshen, Genola, and Elberta. The current principal is Jesse Sorenson. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Lions, named in support for the local Lions Club in 1928. Payson High is notable for its use in the popular 1984 film &quot;Footloose&quot;. Payson was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ute giving Payson historical significance. The city has an overall crime rate of 12 per 1,000 residents, making the crime rate near the average for all cities and towns in the United States. According to FBI crime data, your chance of becoming a victim of crime in Payson is 1 in 89.

<doc id="992611" wikidata="Q3395430" url="?curid=992611" title="Polonium-210">
<text>Polonium-210 (210Po, Po-210, historically radium F) is an isotope of polonium. It undergoes alpha decay to stable 206Pb with a half-life of 138.376 days (about months), the longest half-life of all naturally occurring polonium isotopes (210–218Po). First identified in 1898, and also marking the discovery of the element polonium, 210Po is generated in the decay chain of uranium-238 and radium-226. 210Po is a prominent contaminant in the environment, mostly affecting seafood and tobacco. Its extreme toxicity is attributed to intense radioactivity, mostly due to alpha particles, which easily cause radiation damage, including cancer in surrounding tissue. The specific activity of is 166 TBq/g, i.e., . At the same time, 210Po is not readily detected by common radiation detectors, because its gamma rays have a very low energy. Therefore, can be considered as a quasi-pure alpha emitter.

==History==

In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered a strongly radioactive substance in pitchblende and determined that it was a new element; it was one of the first radioactive elements discovered. Having identified it as such, they named the element polonium after Marie&#x27;s home country, Poland. Willy Marckwald discovered a similar radioactive activity in 1902 and named it radio-tellurium, and at roughly the same time, Ernest Rutherford identified the same activity in his analysis of the uranium decay chain and named it radium F (originally radium E). By 1905, Rutherford concluded that all these observations were due to the same substance, 210Po. Further discoveries and the concept of isotopes, first proposed in 1913 by Frederick Soddy, firmly placed 210Po as the penultimate step in the uranium series.

In 1943, 210Po was studied as a possible neutron initiator in nuclear weapons, as part of the Dayton Project. In subsequent decades, concerns for the safety of workers handling 210Po led to extensive studies on its health effects.

In the 1950s, scientists of the United States Atomic Energy Commission at Mound Laboratories, Ohio explored the possibility of using 210Po in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as a heat source to power satellites. A 2.5-watt atomic battery using 210Po was developed by 1958. However, the isotope plutonium-238 was chosen instead, as it has a longer half-life of 87.7 years.

Polonium-210 was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-FSB officer Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006, and was suspected as a possible cause of Yasser Arafat&#x27;s death, following exhumation and analysis of his corpse in 2012–2013. The radioisotope may also have been used to kill Yuri Shchekochikhin, Lecha Islamov and Roman Tsepov.

==Decay properties==
210Po is an alpha emitter that has a half-life of 138.376 days; it decays directly to stable 206Pb. The majority of the time, 210Po decays by emission of an alpha particle only, not by emission of an alpha particle and a gamma ray; about one in 100,000 decays results in the emission of a gamma ray. 

:formula_1

This low gamma ray production rate makes it more difficult to find and identify this isotope. Rather than gamma ray spectroscopy, alpha spectroscopy is the best method of measuring this isotope.

Owing to its much shorter half-life, a milligram of 210Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 5 grams of 226Ra. A few curies of 210Po emit a blue glow caused by excitation of surrounding air.

210Po occurs in minute amounts in nature, where it is the penultimate isotope in the uranium series decay chain. It is generated via beta decay from 210Pb and 210Bi.

The astrophysical s-process is terminated by the decay of 210Po, as the neutron flux is insufficient to lead to further neutron captures in the short lifetime of 210Po. Instead, 210Po alpha decays to 206Pb, which then captures more neutrons to become 210Po and repeats the cycle, thus consuming the remaining neutrons. This results in a buildup of lead and bismuth, and ensures that heavier elements such as thorium and uranium are only produced in the much faster r-process.

==Production==
=== Deliberate===
Although 210Po occurs in trace amounts in nature, it is not abundant enough (0.1 ppb) for extraction from uranium ore to be feasible. Instead, most 210Po is produced synthetically, through neutron bombardment of 209Bi in a nuclear reactor. This process converts 209Bi to 210Bi, which beta decays to 210Po with a five-day half-life. Through this method, approximately of 210Po are produced in Russia and shipped to the United States every month for commercial applications. By irradiating certain bismuth salts containing light element nuclei such as beryllium, a cascading (α,n) reaction can also be induced to produce 210Po in large quantities.

===Byproduct===
The production of polonium-210 is a downside to reactors cooled with lead-bismuth eutectic rather than pure lead. However, given the eutectic properties of this alloy, some proposed Generation IV reactor designs still rely on lead-bismuth.

==Applications==
A single gram of 210Po generates 140 watts of power. Because it emits many alpha particles, which are stopped within a very short distance in dense media and release their energy, 210Po has been used as a lightweight heat source to power thermoelectric cells in artificial satellites. A 210Po heat source was also in each of the Lunokhod rovers deployed on the surface of the Moon, to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights. Some anti-static brushes, used for neutralizing static electricity on materials like photographic film, contain a few microcuries of 210Po as a source of charged particles. 210Po was also used in initiators for atomic bombs through the (α,n) reaction with beryllium. Small neutron sources reliant on the (α,n) reaction also usually use polonium as a convenient source of alpha particles due to its comparatively low gamma emissions (allowing easy shielding) and high specific activity.

==Hazards==
210Po is extremely toxic; it and other polonium isotopes are some of the most radiotoxic substances to humans. With one microgram of 210Po being more than enough to kill the average adult, it is 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight. One gram of 210Po would hypothetically be enough to kill 50 million people and sicken another 50 million. This is a consequence of its ionizing alpha radiation, as alpha particles are especially damaging to organic tissues inside the body. However, 210Po does not pose a radiation hazard when contained outside the body. The alpha particles it produces cannot penetrate the outer layer of dead skin cells.

The toxicity of 210Po stems entirely from its radioactivity. It is not chemically toxic in itself, but its solubility in aqueous solution as well as that of its salts poses a hazard because its spread throughout the body is facilitated in solution. Intake of 210Po occurs primarily through contaminated air, food, or water, as well as through open wounds. Once inside the body, 210Po concentrates in soft tissues (especially in the reticuloendothelial system) and the bloodstream. Its biological half-life is approximately 50 days.

In the environment, 210Po can accumulate in seafood. It has been detected in various organisms in the Baltic Sea, where it can propagate in, and thus contaminate, the food chain. 210Po is also known to contaminate vegetation, primarily originating from the decay of atmospheric radon-222 and absorption from soil.

In particular, 210Po attaches to, and concentrates in, tobacco leaves. Elevated concentrations of 210Po in tobacco were documented as early as 1964, and cigarette smokers were thus found to be exposed to considerably greater doses of radiation from 210Po and its parent 210Pb. Heavy smokers may be exposed to the same amount of radiation (estimates vary from 100 µSv to 160 mSv per year) as individuals in Poland were from Chernobyl fallout traveling from Ukraine. As a result, 210Po is most dangerous when inhaled from cigarette smoke.

<text>The Aero A.204 was a Czechoslovak airliner that flew in prototype form in 1936. It was developed specifically for ČSA, but much to Aero&#x27;s surprise and disappointment, the national airline selected a British product instead, the Airspeed Envoy. Unable to find a customer, Aero began to develop a military version instead, as the A.304.

Whilst Czechoslovakia was under occupation by Nazi Germany, Aero manufactured the Siebel Si 204 under licence. Similar in configuration to the A.204, these two aircraft are occasionally confused, but the correct Czech designation for the Siebel product is C-3.

<doc id="992614" wikidata="Q562345" url="?curid=992614" title="Kenji Shimizu">
<text>, b. 1940, is an aikido teacher and founder of the aikido style Tendo-ryu Aikido (天道流).

Shimizu was born in 1940 in Fukuoka, Japan. He had been training judo since childhood and held a 4th dan in this art when he changed to aikido in 1963. He then became one of the last personal students of the aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba. After Ueshiba died in 1969, Shimizu, then with a 7th dan in aikido, founded his own school in Tōkyō named Tendoryu (School of the Way of Heaven).

Tendoryu Aikido is characterized by its large and clear movements, emphasizing naturalness and harmonic flow of motion.

Since 1978, Shimizu has regularly held seminars in Germany and other European countries. A German Tendoryu Society was founded in 1993.

He received the 8th dan aikido from the Japanese Budo Federation in 1998 and has co-authored a book titled &quot;Zen and Aikido&quot; () with Shigeo Kamata.

Shimizu received the &#x27;Foreign Minister Award&#x27;, an award from the Foreign Minister of Japan, on July 16, 2002 for his work spreading aikido abroad. Shimizu-sensei was the first Aikido and Budo artist to receive this award. In the same year he was invited to the autumn garden party at the imperial palace in Akasaka, Tōkyō.

<text>Okres (Czech and Slovak term meaning &quot;district&quot; in English; from German Kreis - circle (or perimeter)) refers to administrative entities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is similar to Landkreis in Germany or &quot;okrug&quot; in other Slavic-speaking countries.

The first districts in the Czech lands developed from domains in 1850 by the decision of the Imperial government of Austria. In the territory of present-day Slovakia their predecessors were districts of the counties of the Kingdom of Hungary ( in Slovak). The organisation and functions of the districts were different in the Czech lands and Hungary. After the creation of Czechoslovakia districts became an administrative unit of the new state with a unified status. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the district system was taken over by the two current successor states.

<text>NGC 891 (also known as Caldwell 23, the Silver Sliver Galaxy, and the Outer Limits Galaxy) is an edge-on unbarred spiral galaxy about 30 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda. It was discovered by William Herschel on October 6, 1784. The galaxy is a member of the NGC 1023 group of galaxies in the Local Supercluster. It has an H II nucleus.

The object is visible in small to moderate size telescopes as a faint elongated smear of light with a dust lane visible in larger apertures.

In 1999, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged NGC 891 in infrared.

In 2005, due to its attractiveness and scientific interest, NGC 891 was selected to be the first light image of the Large Binocular Telescope.
In 2012, it was again used as a first light image of the Lowell Discovery Telescope with the Large Monolithic Imager.

Supernova SN 1986J was discovered on August 21, 1986 at apparent magnitude 14.

== Properties ==
NGC 891 looks as the Milky Way would look like when viewed edge-on (some astronomers have even noted how similar to NGC 891 our galaxy looks as seen from the Southern Hemisphere) and, in fact, both galaxies are considered very similar in terms of luminosity and size; studies of the dynamics of its molecular hydrogen have also proven the likely presence of a central bar.
Despite this, recent high-resolution images of its dusty disk show unusual filamentary patterns. These patterns are extending into the halo of the galaxy, away from its galactic disk. Scientists presume that supernova explosions caused this interstellar dust to be thrown out of the galactic disk toward the halo.

It may also be possible that the light pressure from surrounding stars causes this phenomenon.
 
The galaxy is a member of a small group of galaxies, sometimes called the NGC 1023 Group. Other galaxies in this group are the NGCs 925, 949, 959, 1003, 1023, and 1058, and the UGCs 1807, 1865 (DDO 19), 2014 (DDO 22), 2023 (DDO 25), 2034 (DDO 24), and 2259. Its outskirts are populated by multiple low-surface brightness, coherent, and vast substructures, like giant streams that loop around the parent galaxy up to distances of approximately 50 kpc. The bulge and the disk are surrounded by a flat and thick cocoon-like stellar structure. These have vertical and radial distances of up to 15 kpc and 40 kpc, respectively, and are interpreted as the remnant of a satellite galaxy disrupted and in the process of being absorbed by NGC 891.

==In popular culture==
NGC 891 appears alongside M67, the Sombrero Galaxy, the Pinwheel Galaxy, NGC 5128, NGC 1300, M81, and the Andromeda Galaxy in the end credits of the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; TV series, which is why it is occasionally called the Outer Limits Galaxy.

The soundtrack of the 1974 film &quot;Dark Star&quot; by John Carpenter features a muzak-style instrumental piece called &quot;When Twilight Falls on NGC 891&quot;.

The first solo album by Edgar Froese, &quot;Aqua&quot;, also released in 1974, contained a track called &quot;NGC 891&quot;. Side 2 of the album, which included this track, was unusual in having been a rare example of a commercially issued piece of music recorded using the &quot;artificial head&quot; system.

<doc id="992628" wikidata="Q6729297" url="?curid=992628" title="Maeser Elementary">
<text>Maeser Elementary was an elementary school in Provo, Utah. It was named after Karl G. Maeser. Built in 1898, it is the oldest school building in Provo, Utah. The school was designed by architect Richard C. Watkins, who also designed the Provo Third Ward Chapel and Amusement Hall, The Knight Block Building, and the Thomas N. Taylor Mansion.

== Karl G. Maeser ==
Karl G. Maeser was born in Germany. Karl Maeser and his wife Anna Therese Meith were baptized into the LDS Church in 1855, and left shortly thereafter for Utah. Detained on their journey due to their decision to serve various missions for the church, the Maesers did not arrive in Utah until 1860.

In Utah, Maeser operated various schools and served other missions until the year 1876, where he was called to establish an academy in the name of the church. The academy he established was known as the Brigham Young Academy, now Brigham Young University. Karl G. Maeser served as director, principal, and instructor of the academy. Heber J. Grant, a president of the LDS church stated, &quot;Some of our outstanding men... attribute largely to the force of character of Brother Maeser and the impression made upon them while under his influence their successes in life.&quot;

== History ==
The present site of Provo was settled by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1849 when Fort Utah was built near the Provo River. The Mormons, fleeing from persecution in Nauvoo, Illinois, headed west under the direction of Brigham Young and established themselves in the Great Salt Lake area in Utah. Provo was the first settlement in Utah Valley and was part of a plan to establish a chain of communities extending from Salt Lake City. The Mormon communities were planned according to a grid system set forth by their leaders.

The first schools in Provo were sometimes held in public buildings and private residences. In the year 1851, the Provo City council gained power to establish, support and regulate common schools, and in 1853 property taxes were approved for building schools. Before the 1870s in Provo, school buildings were small adobe structures. Then in 1875 one united school district was formed and an era of better buildings and schools began. In 1898 the Board of Education approved plans for the construction of Maeser Elementary. The school was dedicated November 9, 1898 with Karl G. Maeser as guest of honor.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, with note that it was then the oldest public school in Provo that was still in use, and that it &quot;is one of the best-preserved examples of the work of Utah architect Richard Watkins&quot;.

== Today ==
Maeser School&#x27;s enrollment dwindled until the decision was made in 2001 to close its doors. The 6th grade class of 2002 was the final graduating class from Maeser School. The future of the historic Maeser School became what then-Mayor Lewis K. Billings called &quot;The second biggest building controversy in the history of Provo.&quot; The Maeser School was redeveloped by the Provo City Housing Authority as senior housing. Now known as Maeser School Apartments, the redevelopment project has won several awards, including a HGTV Historic Preservation grant, a Reader&#x27;s Choice award from Affordable Housing Finance, and a &quot;Best in State&quot; award for City planning.

The Daily Herald reported: &quot;Somehow, it seems appropriate that historic Maeser School long sheltered young children under its roof and now houses senior residents. After all, it is the very old who most often stop to recall the memories and feelings of how it was to be very young. Perhaps even some elderly folks who attended Maeser School as children will find a welcome reunion and home within its walls in the coming years.&quot;

<text>The Merope Nebula (also known as Tempel&#x27;s Nebula and NGC 1435) is a diffuse reflection nebula in the Pleiades star cluster, surrounding the 4th magnitude star Merope. It was discovered on October 19, 1859 by the German astronomer Wilhelm Tempel. The discovery was made using a 10.5 cm refractor. John Herschel included it as 768 in his General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars but never observed it himself.

The Merope Nebula has an apparent magnitude starting at 13 and quickly dimming by a factor of about 15, making most of the nebula dimmer than magnitude 16. It is illuminated entirely by the star Merope, which is embedded in the nebula. It contains a bright knot, IC 349, about half an arcminute wide near Merope, which was discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard in November 1890. It is naturally very bright but is almost hidden in the radiance of Merope. It appears blue in photographs because of the fine carbon dust spread throughout the cloud. Though it was once thought the Pleiades formed from this and surrounding nebulae, it is now known that the Pleiades nebulosity is caused by a chance encounter with the cloud.

NGC 2169 is at a distance of about 3,600 light years away from Earth. It is nicknamed &quot;The &#x27;37&#x27; Cluster&quot; due to its striking resemblance to the numerals &quot;37&quot;. The cluster is composed of components &quot;Collinder 38&quot;, a I3pn open cluster, and &quot;Collinder 83&quot;, a III3m open cluster.

<doc id="992666" wikidata="Q381231" url="?curid=992666" title="Aero A.304">
<text>The Aero A.304 was a Czechoslovakian bomber aircraft that first flew in 1937. It had originally been developed as an airliner, the A.204, but when Aero could not find buyers for the design, it was militarised and successfully marketed to the Czechoslovak Air Force. 

==Development==

In 1936, the Ministry of National Defense (MNO) issued specifications for a new military aircraft, the type III. This mainly concerned the construction of a short-range three-seater reconnaissance and observation aircraft. Letov, Praga, and Aero entered the competition with the Letov Š-50, the Praga E-51 and the Aero A.304. Aero was slightly favored in this competition as the A-204 prototype was purchased by MNO and Aero was already working on MNO-supported projects. The result was that the Antonín Husník-designed 304 was chosen as the winner. The VTLÚ Institute (Military Technical and Aviation Institute) conducted tests with a 304 bearing the designation S 19.

==Description==

The Aero A.304 was a three- to four-seat twin-engine low-wing aircraft of mixed design with a retractable tail landing gear. The retractable main landing gear had an oil-pneumatic suspension had a leading wheel with a low-pressure tire that was rotatable about a vertical axis, with the rear wheel being fixed and covered by a fairing. The aircraft had an all-metal fuselage partially covered with canvas and duralumin sheets. The frame was welded from Cr-Mo steel tubes to which a wooden body was attached. The wing of the trapezoidal floor plan with an all-wood frame was covered with load-bearing plywood. The metal frame of the ailerons had a canvas covering. The glazed bow had a duralumin construction. A troops and bulkier objects could be transported in the main cabin of the aircraft which was equipped with full-length windows. Production models were painted a &quot;khaki&quot; color with Czechoslovak insignia on both wing surfaces and on the rudder.

Both Walter Super Castor I-MR engines were housed in engine nacelles and mounted flexibly on tubular steel bearings. These were fitted with all accessories (exhaust headers, NACA annular shrouds, oil coolers, ducts, fire walls) and formed separate, easily removable assemblies. The engines drove wooden propellers with a diameter of 295 cm. Engine starting was done with compressed air supplied from a Walter Garelli compressor. Three duralumin fuel tanks with a total volume of 925 liters were installed in the wings. Oil tanks were equipped with electric heaters and had adjustable circulation circuits.

The aircraft was used by the Czechoslovak Air Force as a reconnaissance/observation aircraft and was used for training bomber crews and for combat duty. It was armed with one 7.92 mm vz. 30 machine gun in the glass bow, one 7.92 mm vz. 30 machine gun in a rotating dorsal turret, and one 7.92 mm vz. 30 machine gun in the floor of the firing compartment. In the light bomber role, it carried 300 kg of bombs. The aircraft was equipped with vz. 26/34 and vz. 29 radios, and an AI-34 or A-II-30 camera.

==Operational History==
The aircraft were to be delivered to the Czechoslovak Air Force in the amount of 15 pieces and would belong to its most modern machines. Romania and Greece also showed interest in them, but in the fall of 1938 negotiations were interrupted as a result of the Munich Agreement. The first serial A-304.2 aircraft was flown on February 23, 1939. MNO further expanded the original order to 19 units, but these were delivered only after March 15, 1939. The rest of the production models were gradually completed during 1939-40.

After the occupation of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia by Nazi Germany in March 1939, the planes were captured by the Luftwaffe, which used them in Prostějov (Flugzeugführerschule A/B 71 - FFS A/B 71) for crew training as well as for transporting courier shipments and distinguished persons.A.304s used for transport were modified to seat 6-7 passengers. In 1941, one aircraft, named &quot;Pelikan&quot;, was purchased by the Bulgarian Air Force for coastal patrol duty until 1943.

<text>Giovanni Battista Hodierna, also spelled as Odierna (April 13, 1597 – April 6, 1660) was an Italian astronomer at the court of Giulio Tomasi, Duke of Palma (Palma di Montechiaro). He compiled a catalogue of comets and other celestial objects containing some 40 entries, including at least 19 real and verifiable nebulous objects that might be confused with comets.

==Biography==
Hodierna was born in Ragusa, Sicily and died in Palma di Montechiaro. While serving as a Roman Catholic priest in Ragusa, he also practised astronomy.

In 1654 he published a book entitled &quot;De systemate orbis cometici, deque admirandis coeli characteribus&quot; that contained a catalogue of celestial objects and a list of double stars. The work anticipated Messier&#x27;s catalogue and the double star catalogues by Christian Mayer and William Herschel, but had little impact. Messier seems not to have known of it.

Hodierna was prolific in publication, and his interests spanned many disciplines. In addition to his astronomical observations, he utilized optic microscopes to study insects, publishing on the multifaceted eye of flies and that in bee colonies only the queen is oviparous.

<text>Apple events are the message-based interprocess communication mechanism in Mac OS, first making an appearance in System 7 and supported by every version of the classic Mac OS since then and by macOS. Apple events describe &quot;high-level&quot; events such as &quot;open document&quot; or &quot;print file&quot;, whereas earlier OSs had supported much more basic events, namely &quot;click&quot; and &quot;keypress&quot;. Apple events form the basis of the Mac OS scripting system, the Open Scripting Architecture (the primary language of such being AppleScript).

The starting point is a dynamically-typed, extensible descriptor format called an AEDesc, which is just an OSType code specifying the data type, together with a block of type-dependent data. For instance, the OSType code codice_1 indicates that the data was a four-byte signed integer in big-endian format.

Besides predefined type codes for various common simple types, there are two predefined structured descriptor types: an AERecord, which has data type codice_2 (record), and AEList with type codice_3 (list or array). The internal structure of these contain recursively-nested AEDescs, while the AERecord also associates each element with a unique record field ID, which is an OSType. The Apple Event Manager provides API calls to construct these structures, as well as extract their contents and query the type of contents they hold.

The Apple Event Manager also supports &quot;coercions&quot;, which converts AEDescs from one data type to another. In addition to standard coercions, for instance between integer and real types, applications can install their own coercion handler callbacks, which handle conversions to and from custom data types.

An Apple event proper is an AERecord with fields that depended on the purpose of the event. In addition, it has &quot;attributes&quot; (which are distinct from record fields, which are now called the &quot;parameters&quot; of the event) from a set predefined by the Apple Event Manager. These specify what the event is supposed to do (through &quot;event class&quot; and &quot;event ID&quot;), the target address to which the event is to be sent (which could be a process on the local or a remote machine), and various other options for handling it. Remote machines initially had to be connected via AppleTalk, but Mac OS 9 added the option for connections via TCP/IP.

After sending an Apple event to its target process, the sending process can elect to receive a reply to an Apple event. This can contain various bits of information returned from the target about the processing of the original event, including an error code indicating success/failure, any information requested by the original event, and/or other appropriate information.

Apple events are the foundation of the AppleEvent Object Model, which in turn is the foundation of the OSA and AppleScript. , the official implementation of the Apple Event Manager API is available in C and its descendants, including C++. Official bindings are also provided for Objective-C and Swift through the Cocoa API. Unofficial bindings also exist for other languages (with varying degrees of limitation), including Perl, UserTalk, Ruby and Python.

==Object Model==
The AppleEvent Object Model (AEOM) was a set of protocols built on top of AppleEvents by which applications running under classic Mac OS and macOS could control each other&#x27;s functions. Applications that implemented some part of the AEOM were called &quot;scriptable&quot; because they could be controlled via AppleScript. Unfortunately, scriptability support remained patchy and inconsistent throughout the history of classic Mac OS.

The AEOM provided a syntactic layer under which any application could publish its internal objects, allowing those objects to be manipulated in a standardized way. Unlike other similar-sounding concepts such as ToolTalk, there was a clear, orthogonal distinction between &quot;nouns&quot; and &quot;verbs&quot;; thus, instead of providing separate commands for &quot;close document&quot; and &quot;close window&quot;, there was a single &quot;close&quot; verb which could take references to &quot;document&quot; or &quot;window&quot; objects, or any other object that the application published.

The objects that an application made available through its AEOM support were arranged in a hierarchy. At the top was the application itself, referenced via a null object descriptor. Other objects were referenced by (recursively) specifying their parent object, together with other information identifying it as a child of that parent, all collected in an AERecord. An &quot;iterator&quot; was provided by parents to enumerate their children, or children of a certain class, allowing applications to address a set of elements. The system was generally similar to the Document Object Model used in XML, although with some differences in access patterns.

Each object could have &quot;elements&quot; and &quot;properties&quot;; elements were other objects, which might be created or deleted, while properties could not be created or deleted but had values which might be interrogated or changed. For instance, the application might have one or more window &quot;elements&quot; representing windows showing the contents of currently-open documents. These windows might have &quot;properties&quot; such as their title, position and size.

An application could define custom verbs for operating on its objects. The AEOM also specified various standard verbs which (it was hoped) applications would implement in a consistent fashion, such as open, close, create element, delete, set data, and get data. Each verb was defined as an AppleEvent of a specific type and class, together with particular parameters of particular types that were expected to be present. For instance, the &quot;get data&quot; event was the standard means for obtaining the value of a property: it took essentially one parameter, which was an object descriptor identifying the property to be queried. The value of that property would be returned in the reply event. The &quot;set data&quot; event took two parameters, the object descriptor for the property to set and the new value for the property; the reply event was only expected to return a success status or failure error code.

The entire AppleEvent architecture identifies things using four-byte OSType codes, studiously avoiding actual words or phrases in English (or any other language). Instead, the correspondence between internal AppleEvent codes and external natural-language descriptions is specified through the aete (&quot;AppleEvent Terminology Extension&quot;) resource — the &quot;extension&quot; being to the standard terminology built into AppleScript itself. An application may provide multiple &#x27;aete&#x27; resources for multiple languages, in keeping with the original multilingual design of AppleScript itself

For instance, consider the following AppleScript sequence controlling a fictional drawing application:
 tell application &quot;ScriptableDraw&quot;
 set background color of window &quot;New Drawing&quot; to background color of window &quot;Old Drawing&quot;
 end tell
This actually involves the sending of two AppleEvents to the target application (and the receipt of their corresponding replies): first, a get-data event is sent to retrieve the background color property of the window identified by the name &quot;Old Drawing&quot;; then a set-data event is sent to apply the value returned as the background color property of the window named &quot;New Drawing&quot;.

Since this sort of access pattern was typical, AppleScript made widespread use of the codice_4 statement, which switched the context to the named object in a fashion similar to the codice_5 statement found in Visual Basic or Pascal. All commands after the codice_4 to the corresponding codice_7 would be sent to the object named in the codice_4, instead of the default object, which was the current application.

Object descriptors allowed the identification of objects in various ways. The most interesting one was using a where-clause (which translated into AppleScript terminology as a &quot;filter expression&quot;). For instance, the AppleScript 1.0 SDK shipped with the source code for an example application called the Scriptable Text Editor, which would respond to scripts such as:
 tell application &quot;Scriptable Text Editor&quot;
 tell window &quot;Example Document&quot;
 set text style of every word whose length &gt; 7 to bold
 end tell
 end tell
Even today, it is rare to find this kind of power in general-purpose scripting languages outside of SQL.

Adding support for the AEOM in the classic Mac OS was a difficult process. Application developers had to identify their objects and hand-write code to allow them to be addressed. This typically took the form of code for returning the &quot;next&quot; object of a particular type, allowing AppleScript to iterate over them. But since the OS did not contain an object model, this work was left entirely to the developers, many of whom did not implement it. Oddly, even Apple&#x27;s own application framework, MacApp, did not offer such a model except for the GUI objects it knew about, once again making the developer do most of the work of scripting the objects representing the data itself. Largely for these reasons, AppleScript support was not very widespread.

Apple did attempt to address this problem with the introduction of various object &quot;suites&quot;, which represented standard objects and verbs that were expected to be supported by different types of applications. For instance, all applications were expected to support the &quot;core suite&quot;, and any application editing text was expected to support the &quot;text suite&quot;. By selecting a suitable set of suites, the developer could at least reduce the workload of planning how to expose their objects. Yet because these objects were generally not part of the system itself (with the exception of the severely limited TextEdit editor), the actual implementation was left to the developer.

Applications developed in Cocoa, the system formerly known as OpenStep, offer a rich object runtime that can be queried from any other application. This makes implementation of the AEOM considerably easier, dramatically reducing the amount of code needed in the average application. Additionally the majority of Cocoa applications are constructed primarily from Cocoa-standard objects, all of which were upgraded to offer fairly extensive scriptability. This extends not only to GUI objects as under MacApp, but also to data objects inside them, including text, tables and various list objects. A text file is used to map the internal &quot;object-like&quot; names onto human-readable versions, and in most cases creating this is all that is needed to add fairly substantial scriptability to most programs.

While Cocoa applications are not AEOM based, and often use subtly different objects than Apple&#x27;s originally defined standard objects, Cocoa apps are generally much more scriptable than their &quot;classic&quot; counterparts—in fact, it is uncommon to find a Cocoa application that is &quot;not&quot; scriptable to some degree.

== Scripting Bridge ==
The Scripting Bridge is a macOS framework which allows applications to communicate with each other without the use of an intermediary scripting language such as AppleScript. Like AppleScript, the Scripting Bridge uses Apple events for inter-application communication.

The Scripting Bridge is typically used from Objective-C, but can be used in other programming languages through an Objective-C bridge such as MacRuby and PyObjC.

<text>A dugout or dug-out, also known as a pit-house or earth lodge, is a shelter for humans or domesticated animals and livestock based on a hole or depression dug into the ground. Dugouts can be fully recessed into the earth, with a flat roof covered by ground, or dug into a hillside. They can also be semi-recessed, with a constructed wood or sod roof standing out.
These structures are one of the most ancient types of human housing known to archaeologists, and the same methods have evolved into modern &quot;earth shelter&quot; technology.

Dugouts may also be temporary shelters constructed as an aid to specific activities, e.g., concealment and protection during warfare or shelter while hunting.

==Africa==

===Tunisia===
First driven underground by enemies who invaded their country, the Berbers of Matmata found underground homes the best defense against summer heat.

==Asia and the Pacific==

===Australia===

Burra in South Australia&#x27;s Mid-North region was the site of the famous &#x27;Monster Mine&#x27; (copper) and home to 4,400 people in 1851, 1,800 of whom were living in dugouts in the Burra Creek. Census data from 1851 shows that nearly 80 percent of the workers living in the dugouts were miners, with probably the majority being Cornish. Floods and the Victorian gold rush effectively ended the large scale use of dugouts in Burra, but people were still being &#x27;washed&#x27; out of the creek in 1859.

Coober Pedy is a small outback town in northern South Australia, 846 kilometres north of Adelaide on the Stuart Highway, where opal mining is the dominant industry. Most residents live in caves excavated into the hillsides to avoid the harsh summer temperatures and work underground in mine shafts. White Cliffs, New South Wales is similar, in terms of climate, housing, and mining operations.

===China===
In north China, especially on the Loess Plateau, caves called yaodongs dug into hillsides have been the traditional dwellings from early times. The advantage of a yaodong over an ordinary house is that it needs little heating in winter and no cooling in summer. An estimated 40 million people in northern China live in a yaodong. Many people live in semi-recessed dugout houses in north-western China where hot summers and cold winters prevail.

===Japan===

In the Early Jōmon period of Japanese prehistory (10,000 to 300 BC) complex pit houses were the most commonly used method of housing.

==Middle East==
===Israel===

During the Bar Kokhba Revolt, Jews used an intricate system of man-made hideout complexes, prepared well in advance of the onset of the revolt. Many such sites were discovered in Judaea and the Galilee, for instance at Horvat &#x27;Ethri.

===Turkey (Cappadocia)===
Cappadocia contains at least 36 historical underground cities, carved out of unusual geological formations formed via the eruptions of ancient volcanoes. The cities were initially inhabited by the Hittites, then later by early Christians as hiding places. They are now archeological and tourist sites, but are not generally occupied (see Kaymaklı Underground City). The latest large Turkish underground city was discovered in 2007 in Gaziemir, Güzelyurt. This city was a stopover on the Silk Road, allowing travelers and their camels to rest in safety, underground, in a &#x27;fortress&#x27; hotel equivalent to a modern hotel.

==Europe==

===Crimea===
The well-preserved cave towns of Crimea are Mangup-Kale, Eski-Kermen, Inkerman and Chufut-Kale. The settlement of Mangup-Kale dates back to the 3rd century AD and was fortified by Justinian I in the mid 6th century. It was inhabited and governed primarily by Crimean Goths, and became the center of their autonomous principality. The last inhabitants, a small community of Karaims, abandoned the site in the 1790s.

===Iceland===

In Iceland, since time immemorial and well into the 20th century, most houses were partly dug down, with turf or sod walls built up and roofs made of timber and turf/sod. Turf was used because timber was scarce and expensive, and stone not practical before the advent of concrete.

===Italy===

Matera has gained international fame for its ancient town, the &quot;Sassi di Matera&quot; (meaning &quot;stones of Matera&quot;), which is UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. The Sassi are houses dug into the volcanic rock itself, known locally as &quot;Tufo&quot;, which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands the dugout () was banned by the housing safety law of 1901. In some areas in the east of the country, people lived in dugouts into the 1960s. Dutch dugouts are constructed around an excavated pit with a roof made from heather sod, and front and back walls made from slabs of peat. A small number of these huts survive, and can be seen in the open air museums of Arnhem, Schoonoord, Barger-Compascuum and Harkema. Modernized dugouts are available as tourist accommodation in several locations.

===Poland (Mazovia)===
Dugouts called &quot;ziemianka&quot; were used as stores for food in Mazovia (Poland).

===Romania===
Dugouts called Bordei were widely used on the territory of Romania since the Neolithic until mid-20th century. They were wide-spread in the plains, such as on the Romanian Plain, where dwellers could use cheap construction materials such as pit, wood and straw, but more durable materials such as stone were rare and expensive. Similar dug-outs were used in the neighbouring regions of the wider Eurasian Steppe, e.g. in Ukraine, where they were known as Burdei.
===Scotland===
In ancient Scotland, earth houses, also known as yird, Weems and Picts&#x27; houses, were underground dwellings, extant even after the Roman evacuation of Britain. Entry was effected by a passage not much wider than a fox burrow, which sloped downwards 10 or 12 ft. to the floor of the house; the inside was oval in shape, and was walled with overlapping rough stone slabs; the roof frequently reached to within a foot of the Earth&#x27;s surface; they probably served as storehouses, winter quarters, and as places of refuge in times of war. Similar dwellings are found in Ireland.

===Serbia===
In Serbia they are called &quot;zemunica&quot;. Also, the town of Zemun derived its name from Zemln, which is akin to zemunica.

===Spain===
The most famous feature of the town of Guadix is the cave dwellings in the &quot;Barrio.&quot;

==North America==
Many of the ancient peoples of the American continents built semi-permanent houses of poles and brush plastered with mud over a shallow pit in the earth. As these pithouses were very similar to those first built in northeastern Europe 25,000 years ago, pithouse technology may have been carried to the Americas by early nomadic settlers, traveling first through Siberia, and then across the ice bridge between Asia and North America about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago.

An individual pithouse was occupied for an average of about 15 years. By more modern standards, these dwellings were cramped and dark. The centralized hearth created a smoky, cold environment during the winter. Most pithouses are associated with an open air plaza or rooftop where inhabitants carried out most of their daily activities during good weather. In areas suitable for intensive agriculture, groups of pithouses clustered to create communities of varying sizes.

===British Columbia and American Northwest===
In the Interior Plateau of the British Columbia and in the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest the remains of a form of pit-house called a quiggly hole or &quot;kekuli&quot; are common, and come in large groups named quiggly towns, which are correspondingly the remains of ancient villages.

===Canadian Prairies===
The Doukhobor Dugout House in Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008. Although today it is the only known partially surviving example of this type of shelter, it was one of many such dugout houses constructed by Doukhobors upon arrival in Canada, and a form of shelter used by many settlers of various ethnicities upon their arrival on the prairies.

===American Southwest===

Pithouses were very common structures in the American Southwest during the early and middle periods of the Anasazi, Mogollon and Hohokam cultures, and were also found in cultures extending north and west of the Colorado plateau. The emergence of the pithouse marks the transition between a nomadic hunting-and-gathering livelihood and a settled agricultural way of life which also relied on wild plants and animals for food. Pithouse structures were probably the forerunners of the kivas built later in the Pueblo periods, and share many characteristics with them.

Although the architectural styles used by these people evolved throughout their history, the pithouse remained a basic residential structure. Pithouses are found in isolated rural settings, in conjunction with above ground dwellings and adjacent to the large multi-room cliff dwellings characteristic of the region. Historian Linda Cordell notes that &quot;...the late pithouses are often clues to relatively short-term changes in settlement location and adjustment to climatic fluctuations. &quot; (Cordell, p. 164) This appears to be true among the modern Pueblo peoples as well. When the Hopi village of Bacavi was founded in 1909, some groups of people arrived in the late autumn. As there was a limited window of time for building, the new arrivals built pithouses as warm shelters for the winter. Some of these homes remained occupied until the 1970s.

Pithouses were built by excavating a well defined hole into the ground, usually around 6&quot; to 18&quot; deep but occasionally as deep as four to five feet, and creating walls and roof using a pole and adobe technology. The sunken floor of the dwelling is below the frost line and helps moderate both winter and summer temperatures, with the mass of the ground serving as an insulator. In addition, adobe walls gather heat during the day and release it when temperatures drop. The earliest pithouses were round, and varied in size between nine and twenty-five feet in diameter. Around 700, pithouse designs became more individualized. Excavations reveal examples based on squares, rectangles and shapes similar to the letter D.
These homes were also warmed by a centralized hearth, a fire pit with an air deflector, and side vents and a smoke hole in the roof provided fresh air and evacuated smoke. The placement of the home&#x27;s entrance varied by locality and archaeological period. Early homes utilized the ventilation stack as an egress by means of a ladder. Later homes expanded the pit into a keyhole shape to create a low sheltered entrance. Interior space was often loosely divided into two rooms, one for storing personal and dry goods and the other as living quarters. Many pithouses included an antechamber, containing storage bins or pits.

Pithouse construction was usually based on four corner posts positioned upright in the pit. These posts were carefully chosen and trimmed to create a branch or fork at the top as a structural support. They were joined by horizontal beams and crossed with ceiling joists. The interior sides of the pit were plastered with clay or lined with stone — either large slabs wedged upright in the soil or courses of smaller stones. The exterior of the pithouse was formed of branches, packed tree bark, or brush and grass. A thick layer of mud on the outside of the roof and walls protected the shelter from the weather. Often the initial mud layer was carefully plastered with a lighter colored clay.

A large number of pithouses have been archaeologically excavated throughout the American Southwest. Reproductions of these basic family structures exist in museums and tourist information sites, such as the structure at the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. National and state parks and monuments showcase pithouse ruins and may include authentic reconstructions such as the Ancient Pueblo structure at Step House ruin, Mesa Verde National Park, Fremont Indian State Park and Museum in Utah, and a Hohokam structure at the Hardy Site in Tucson, Arizona.

===Sod houses===

During the American Civil War, the federal United States government passed the Homestead Act offering free land for those who could &quot;prove up&quot; their claims by living on the land and farming it for a prescribed number of years. Settlers on the newly opened Great Plains found there were not enough trees to build familiar log cabins. As shelter was essential, the settlers utilized ribbons of the thick prairie sod cut from the land. The strip could be cut into two foot sections, four to six inches deep, to make an almost perfect building block with good insulating properties.

These first homes, often called &quot;soddies&quot;, were small rooms dug into the side of a low rolling hill. The walls were built up with sod blocks to a height of seven or eight feet. Holes were left for purchased doors and windows hauled from the nearest town or railhead. Cottonwood poles were laid side by side to form a support for a roof made of a thick layer of coarse prairie grass. Over this was carefully fitted a double layer of the sod building blocks. Rain helped the sod to grow and soon the dugout roof was covered with waving grass. Some frontier families found that their cows grazed on their roof, and occasionally had them fall through.

The floor of the dugout home was of dirt or rough wooden planks. Walls were lined with newspapers pasted or pinned up with small, sharpened sticks to keep dirt from flaking into the home&#x27;s interior. Some families used fabric on their walls while others created a plaster coating from local limestone and sand. Some were carpeted and other variations included building on a second room for school teachers or guests. Heating could be provided by burning buffalo chips or cow chips. The home&#x27;s comfort and structural stability were maximized when the structure was located on the south side of a low hill, with adequate drainage to provide run-off for rain and melting snow. Most pioneer dugouts had a short lifespan, being replaced by plank or rock homes when farmers had time and money to create larger, more traditional homes. When a family built a house of logs or boards, their domestic animals often continued to be sheltered in a sod dugout.

===Burdeis===

In frontier Canada and the United States, dugout style shelters were also used by pioneers and settlers from Europe. In these cases, the shelter&#x27;s construction closely reflected the architecture of the various settlers&#x27; origins. They ranged from the French-Canadian–style sod houses called &quot;caveaux&quot; to the &quot;burdeis&quot; built by Ukrainian immigrants. The burdei was intended as a temporary refuge until a &quot;proper&quot; home of poplar logs and mud/straw plaster could be built. Mennonites from Imperial Russia also built burdeis as temporary shelters when they settled in the Hillsboro region of Kansas.

==Wartime dugouts==
===World War I===
Dugouts were used extensively as protection from shelling during World War I in the Western Front. They were an important part of the trench warfare as they were used as an area to rest and carry out other activities such as eating. They would usually range in size from dugouts that could hold several men to dugouts that could hold thousands of soldiers. Some sophisticated dugouts, such as the Vampire dugout, were placed more than underground, lined with concrete, wood and steel to withstand the shock of artillery, accessed via a set of wooden stairs.

About 180 dugout sites have been located in the Ypres Salient and in the 1990s some of them were entered, at least in part. The level of activity can be gauged by the fact that during 1917 and 1918, more people lived underground in the Ypres area than reside in the town today.

===&quot;Zemlyankas&quot; (WWII)===
In World War II, partisans, or armed resistance fighters in Eastern Europe sometimes lived in dugouts called &quot;zemlyankas&quot; (Russian or ) which were used as underground bunkers to provide shelter and a hiding place from enemies. In Poland they were called &quot;ziemianki&quot;.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
In the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, dugouts are used extensively by both sides for similar tactical reasons.

<doc id="992677" wikidata="Q1627478" url="?curid=992677" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern">
<text>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are characters in William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;. They are childhood friends of Hamlet, summoned by King Claudius to distract the prince from his apparent madness and if possible to ascertain the cause of it. The characters were revived in W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s satire, &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;, and as the alienated heroes of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s absurdist play, &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, which was adapted into a film.

==Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;==

=== Names ===
&quot;Rosencrantz&quot; (&quot;rose wreath&quot;) and &quot;Gyldenstjerne/Gyllenstierna&quot; (&quot;golden star&quot;) were names of Danish (and Norwegian, and Swedish) noble families of the 16th century; records of the Danish royal coronation of 1596 show that one tenth of the aristocrats participating bore one or the other name.

James Voelkel suggests that the characters were named after Frederik Rosenkrantz and Knud Gyldenstierne, cousins of Tycho Brahe who had visited England in 1592. When James VI and I visited Norway and Denmark in 1589, he met Tycho Brahe and Henrik Gyldenstierne, captain of Bohus. In a gift exchange, Gyldenstierne gave James VI a firearm and a sword, and James VI gave him a ring and a gold chain. When James VI was at Elsinore (Kronborg), a servant of Axel Gyldenstierne, captain of Akershus, was rewarded for bringing letters to the Scottish king.

The majority of characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot; have classical names, in contrast to the &quot;particularly Danish&quot; ones of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The names were common in the court of Frederick II and Christian IV, and also at the University of Wittenberg, an institution where Hamlet is mentioned as having studied (he refers to them as &quot;my two schoolfellows&quot;).

=== Appearances ===
In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern always appear as a pair, except in editions following the First Folio text, where Guildenstern enters four lines after Rosencrantz in , Scene 3.

The two courtiers first appear in , Scene 2, where they attempt to place themselves in the confidence of Prince Hamlet, their childhood friend. The smooth and courtly language they employ immediately establishes them as sycophants really serving as spies for the corrupt King Claudius, Hamlet&#x27;s uncle, who usurped the throne and constantly attempts to check his nephew. Hamlet welcomes them as &quot;excellent good friends&quot;, but, seeing through their guise, comments that they won&#x27;t &quot;deal justly&quot; with him about their mission. Realising that he lacks allies except for Horatio, Hamlet gives the speech &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot; to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

In , Hamlet seems to drop the pretense of friendship, coldly dismissing the two in Scene 2. Line 319 is perhaps his only use of the royal &quot;we&quot; in the play, although he may also be addressing the other person present on the stage, Horatio, with whom Hamlet first saw the ghost they are discussing. To his mother, he comments in Scene 4 that &quot;I will trust [them] as I will adders fang&#x27;d.&quot;

When Hamlet kills Polonius, Claudius recruits Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to escort Hamlet to England, providing them with a letter for the King of England instructing him to have Hamlet killed. (They are apparently unaware of what is in the letter, though Shakespeare never explicitly says so.) Along the journey, the distrustful Hamlet finds and rewrites the letter, instructing the executioner to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. When their ship is attacked by pirates, Hamlet returns to Denmark, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to die; he comments in , Scene 2 that &quot;They are not near my conscience; their defeat / Does by their own insinuation grow.&quot; Ambassadors returning later report that &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.&quot;

=== Function ===
As agents of the corruption infecting the court, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern contribute to setting up the confrontation between Hamlet and Claudius. Shakespeare expects the audience to appreciate the poetic justice of their deaths: while they are very likely ignorant of the deadly contents of the letter they carry to England and are, to that extent, innocent victims of Hamlet&#x27;s retaliation, they are seen as having received their just deserts for their participation in Claudius&#x27;s intrigues.

==Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;==

W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s play (1874) is a comedy in which Rosencrantz plots with his friend Guildenstern to get rid of Hamlet, so that Rosencrantz can marry Ophelia. They discover that Claudius has written a play. The king&#x27;s literary work is so embarrassingly bad that Claudius has decreed that anyone who mentions it must be executed. They obtain the manuscript and convince Hamlet to perform it. When he does, Claudius decrees that he must die, but is eventually persuaded to banish him to England. Rosencrantz and Ophelia can now be together.

==Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;==
As the protagonists of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play and film, they are confused by the events of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and seem unaware of their role in the larger drama. The play is primarily a comedy, but they often stumble upon deep philosophical truths through their nonsensical ramblings. In the movie, Rosencrantz invents the sandwich, and discovers gravity and volume displacement, among other things. The characters depart from their epiphanies as quickly as they come to them.

At times, one appears more enlightened than the other—but they trade this enlightenment back and forth throughout the drama. Stoppard also littered his play with jokes that refer to the common thespian tendency to swap Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the midst of the play because the characters are basically identical. He does this by making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern unsure of who is who, as well as having the other players (Claudius, Hamlet, Gertrude) refer to them frequently by the wrong names. Because of the play&#x27;s similarity to &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Rosencrantz is sometimes compared to Estragon (one of the tramps who wait for Godot), and who shares his dim perception of reality, while Guildenstern parallels Vladimir, who shares his analytical perception.

<doc id="992679" wikidata="Q4115754" url="?curid=992679" title="1987 Mecca incident">
<text>On 31 July 1987, during the Hajj (Arabic for pilgrimage) in Mecca, a clash between Shia pilgrim demonstrators and the Saudi Arabian security forces resulted in the death of more than 400 people. The event has been variously described as a &quot;riot&quot; or a &quot;massacre&quot;. It developed from increasing tensions between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Since 1981, Iranian pilgrims have held a political demonstration against Israel and the United States every year at Hajj, but in 1987, a cordon of Saudi police and the Saudi Arabian National Guard sealed part of the planned demonstration route, resulting in a confrontation between them and the pilgrims. This escalated into a violent clash, followed by a deadly stampede. 

How many pilgrims died and how they died are both disputed. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia blame each other for the loss of life. Estimates of fatalities range from 400 with thousands more injured (Iranian government); 402, of which 275 were Iranian pilgrims, 85 Saudi police, and 42 pilgrims from other countries (Saudi government); and more than 400 dead (&quot;New York Times&quot;). Saudis claim the pilgrims were armed and died in a stampede. Iranians claim many were killed by Saudi gunfire.

After the incident, Iranians attacked the Saudi, Kuwaiti and French Embassies, abducting four Saudis from the embassy.

==Background==

Iran and Saudi Arabia have been called &quot;bitter regional rivals&quot; on &quot;opposing sides of bloody conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq&quot;. This is in part for theological reasons — namely the differences between the two Islamic schools of thought that their governments adhere to. The Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam has both long supported the ruling House of Saud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and long opposed Shi&#x27;i Islam as a sect deviant from true Islam. Iranian Shia majority and Shi&#x27;i government were well aware of Wahhabi antagonism towards them and the &quot;history of mistrust&quot; between Shi‘ite pilgrims and Sunni hosts &quot;stretches back as far as the sixteenth century&quot;.
Adding to this was the revolutionary antagonism of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his anti-American, anti-monarchy Iranian Revolutionary followers against the pro-American royal rulers of Saudi Arabia.
In a 1987 public address Khomeini declared that &quot;these vile and ungodly Wahhabis are like daggers which have always pierced the heart of the Muslims from the back&quot;. He announced that Mecca was in the hands of &quot;a band of heretics&quot;, (i.e. the House of Saud).

The incident occurred during the last phase of the bloody Iran–Iraq War, at a moment of &quot;escalating tensions&quot; between Sunni Arab-ruled Iraq (which was receiving help from Sunni Arab-ruled Saudi Arabia) and Persian Shi&#x27;i-ruled Iran. America had reflagged of Kuwaiti petroleum tankers and the introduced of foreign naval escorts in the Persian Gulf, a foreign intervention favored by Saudi Arabia and opposed by Iran. .

Serious loss of life at Hajj occurs periodically (in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2015); not surprising in a situation where two million or more pilgrims &quot;all trying to do the same thing in the same place on the same day&quot; while speaking different languages, and are vulnerable to death from suffocation or being physically crushed in the press of the crowd. In 2015, an estimated 2,400 pilgrims, including more than 400 Iranians, were killed in a stampede, that led to a &quot;war of words&quot; between Iran and Saudi Arabia that reached a &quot;fever pitch&quot;.

===Post-Iranian revolutionary hajjs===
For years, Iranian pilgrims had tried to stage demonstrations which are known as &quot;Distancing Ourselves from Mushrikīn&quot; (برائت از مشرکين) in the Muslim holy city of Mecca during the &quot;hajj&quot;. &quot;Anti shah, anti-Israel and anti-American propaganda during the Hajj&quot; by devotees of Khomeini had been happening since about 1971. These demonstrations had their origins in 1971, when Ruhollah Khomeini instructed his Shiite followers to distribute political messages when performing their pilgrimage. Even though a few Iranians were arrested for this act, the Saudi officials were generally apathetic, as they did not view these political messages to be a threat to the Saudi royalty. After the revolution, following the principles elaborated by Khomeini, they appealed directly to the Muslim pilgrims of other lands gradually heightening political activity in each the pilgrimage. Iran claimed that &quot;the Hajj and the Holy places should be placed under international oversight as opposed to being managed by the Saudis alone&quot;. The Saudi government reacted to these disturbances with increasing concern because &quot;the Hajj is an important legitimizing factor for the Saudi ruling family&quot;.

The first large clash between Shia pilgrims and Saudi security forces occurred in 1981. In 1981, this was escalated to chanting political slogans in the Masjid al-Haram and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque, two of the holiest sites in Islam, resulting in violent clashes with Saudi security and one death. In the same year, King Khalid of Saudi Arabia wrote a letter to Saddam Hussein saying &quot;crush these stupid Iranians&quot; as Saddam continued with the invasion of Iranian territory.

In 1982, Khomeini appointed Hojatoleslam Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha as the supervisor and personal representative of Ayatollah Khomeini. Khoiniha was the &quot;mentor&quot; of the students who had seized the United States Embassy in the Iran hostage crisis. During the hajj that year, Saudi police clashed with demonstrators who Khoiniha addressed in both Medina and Mecca. In Mecca he was arrested, and after giving a speech in Medina following the pilgrimage he was declared an “instigator” and expelled from Saudi Arabia.

During the next few years, both sides tried to calm the situation: Khomeini urged his devotees to maintain peace and order, not to distribute printed political material, and not to criticize Muslim governments. In return, Saudi officials changed their earlier policy and allowed two separate demonstrations to occur: One in Mecca, and the other in Medina. By 1986, the situation was calm enough for Saudi officials to re-open the al-Baqi&#x27; cemetery for Shiite pilgrims, and in response, Khomeini&#x27;s representative formally thanked the Saudi King for the gesture. However, in the same year, Iranian radical Mehdi Hashemi was accused of smuggling explosives on an airplane headed for Saudi Arabia, renewing Saudi fears.

Internationally, U.S. naval forces were being introduced into the Persian Gulf during this time in response to the Iran-Iraq War and heightening political tensions.

===Planning for 1987 demonstration===
According to the speech early in July 1987, Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha said that &quot;a mere march or demonstration by Iranians will not suffice&quot;. He demanded that the Saudi regime allow Iranian pilgrims to enter the Great Mosque in Mecca at the end of their demonstration, without the presence of security guards. Then a representative of Khomeini would explain Iran’s case regarding the Iran Iraq war and an Iranian pilgrimage representative would conduct a referendum among all the pilgrims over the decision of the emir of Kuwait to invite foreign escorts for Kuwaiti tankers. “All we ask is that the Saudi government not oppose this, nor send its guards to the Great Mosque. Let us see what happens. We will try it for one year.” 

Even though Mehdi Karrubi, who was Khomeini&#x27;s official pilgrimage representative that year, tried to assure Saudi officials that the demonstrations would occur in the usual manner and in the agreed routes, it did little to quell the Saudi fears.

But Saudis and Iranians worked together to go over &quot;the route of the planned demonstration&quot;. As a result of dialogue and strict regulations which were imposed after it, it was agreed that &quot;the demonstration would end half a kilometer before the great Mosque&quot;, but the decision &quot;put the Saudi security forces on a high state of alert&quot;, and 
Saudi authorities &quot;remained deeply suspicious&quot;. An unnamed Saudi authority quoted by Israeli scholar Martin Kramer criticized the planned demonstration, stating that while Saudi Arabia provided occasions &quot;for the expression of Muslim opinion on various matters&quot;, even during the hajj, political demonstrations in the Great Mosque would constitute a religious innovation in Islam (&quot;Bid&#x27;ah&quot;), and “anyone who attempts to innovate in Islam will go to hell.” Just before the Mecca demonstration, Saudis pressured the Iranian representative Karrubi to cancel the march, which he refused to do.

Two days before the planned demonstration, Khomeini’s annual message to the pilgrims was published, which as in years past, &quot;included the customary plea&quot; to pilgrims that they &#x27;avoid clashes, insults, and disputes,&#x27; and warned against those intent on disruption &#x27;who might embark on spontaneous moves&#x27;.

On Friday 31 July 1987, the demonstration started amid heightened security after Friday&#x27;s midday prayers, while Iranian pilgrims chanted &quot;Death to America! Death to the Soviet Union! Death to Israel!&quot;. The march was uneventful until the end of the planned route when the demonstrators found their way blocked by Saudi riot police and National Guardsmen. At this point, some of the Iranians began to call for the demonstrators to press ahead and continue to the Great Mosque, at the same time &quot;unidentified persons in an adjacent parking garage&quot; began to throw &quot;bricks, pieces of concrete, and iron bars&quot; at the Iranians. These events angered the Iranians, escalating the situation into a violent clash between the Iranian pilgrims and the Saudi security forces. 

===Force used===
The Saudis reportedly used truncheons and electric prods and the Iranians reportedly used knives and clubs.
Saudi security personnel deny firing at the demonstrators, Saudi officials insist that no shots were fired, and that all deaths were caused by the melee and stampede. In a Washington news conference, the Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan claimed that &quot;not one bullet was fired&quot;, blaming the violence on the Iranian pilgrims who he accused of &quot;brandishing knives, clubs and broken glass drawn from beneath their cloaks&quot;. 

Iranian officials maintain that the Saudis had fired on the protesters without provocation and that the demonstrations had been peaceful. Robin Wright also reports that &quot;many of the Iranian bodies, shown to American and European reporters immediately upon their return to Tehran, had bullet punctures.&quot; Ami Ayalon, an Israeli politician, wrote that &quot;most of the Iranian pilgrims apparently shot by Saudi security authorities during the demonstration&quot;. Martin Kramer also writes that &quot;according to American intelligence sources, the tide was finally turned by reinforcements from the National Guard, who fired tear gas shells into the crowd and then opened fire with pistols and automatic weapons&quot;.

===Casualties===
The rioting and the resulting stampede reportedly caused the death of 402 people (275 Iranians, 85 Saudis, including policemen, and 42 pilgrims from other countries) and 649 people were reportedly wounded (303 Iranians, 145 Saudis and 201 other nationals). The Iranian news agency announced that &quot;200 Iranians had been killed and more than 2,000 wounded&quot;. Martin Kramer states that the Iranian authorities claimed that 400 Iranian pilgrims died, and that several thousand were injured.

==Reaction/aftermath==
After the incident, Ali Khamenei, then president of Iran, declared that &quot;they are now propagandizing and claiming that this incident was a war between Shia and Sunni. This is a lie! Of course, there is a war, but a war between the American perception of Islam and true revolutionary Islam.&quot;

Another high level Iranian leader, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, urged Muslim religious leaders to &quot;wrest control of Islam&#x27;s holy sites in Saudi Arabia from the royal family&quot;. In Iraq, the Revolutionary Command Council, ostensibly an organ of the secular Baath Arab socialist party, demanded that visiting of Islam&#x27;s holy sites by Iranians should be banned. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon asked Saudi Arabia to &quot;pay for the deaths of the Shiite pilgrims&quot;.

On 3 August 1987, one million Iranians converged on the building of the Islamic Council in Tehran, screaming &quot;Revenge! Revenge!&quot; in a rally &quot;marking what was officially described as &#x27;a day of hate,&#x27; according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency&quot;. On the same day, the Iranian leader Khomeini called on Saudis to overthrow the House of Saud to avenge the pilgrims&#x27; deaths.

For three years after the incident of 1987 -- from 1988 to 1990 -- the Iranian government banned Iranians from going on the Hajj but &quot;diplomatic ties were restored in 1991&quot;.
Following the incident, Saudi Arabia ended its diplomatic relations with Iran and it reduced the number of permitted Iranian pilgrims to 45,000, down from 150,000 in earlier years. In 1991, Iran and Saudi Arabia renewed diplomatic relations after agreeing to allow Iranian pilgrims to perform the Hajj once more. The total number of pilgrims was set at 115,000, and the demonstrations by Iranians were again allowed, but only in one specific location granted by the Saudis. By this agreement, Iranian pilgrims continued their annual demonstration during the 1990s and 2000s with few or no incidents. They limited their rally to within the confines of their compound in Mecca.

Approximately 20,000 Pakistani troops who were stationed in Saudi Arabia were sent back to Pakistan, because Saudi Arabia was uncomfortable with the presence of Shi&#x27;ite soldiers.

Martin Kramer writes that &quot;as no independent investigation will ever be conducted, important details will remain in doubt. But no evidence has been produced by Saudi Arabia or Iran to establish that the other side acted deliberately or with premeditation in order to provoke violence.&quot;

<text>The Aero A.300 was a Czechoslovak bomber aircraft that first flew in 1938 as a much refined development of the A.304. It was designed by Aero to meet a requirement for a bomber-reconnaissance aircraft for the Czechoslovak Air Force, the Aero A-304 transport/bomber formed the basis for its design. It was a four-seat aircraft powered by two Bristol Mercury IX radial engines . The A-300 was faster than any other Czechoslovak aircraft in the inventory except for the Avia B-35 fighter. Despite showing much promise, development and production of the aircraft was stopped by the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.

==Development and design==

In July 1936, the Czech aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody offered a concept design for an aircraft to meet a specification issued by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence earlier that year. Aero&#x27;s proposed design, the Aero A-300, was derived from the earlier Aero A.304 bomber-trainer (itself based on the A.204 airliner), and resulted in an order to continue development being placed in 1937, with work beginning on construction of a prototype that year.

The A-300 was a twin-engined, low-wing monoplane of mixed wood and metal construction, with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage, that was intended to carry out both bombing and reconnaissance missions. The wings were of wooden construction, while the fuselage had a chrome-molybdenum steel-tube structure, with a duralumin and wood frame covered by sheet metal making the outer shape of the aircraft. The aircraft was powered by two Bristol Mercury IX radial engines driving three-bladed propellers and rated at at . The aircraft had a crew of four, with a bomb-aimer/observer/gunner sitting in the nose, a single pilot in an enclosed cockpit, a gunner operating a dorsal turret behind the cockpit and a gunner/radio operator in the rear fuselage. Defensive armament consisted of three vz.30 machine guns, one in the nose, one in the dorsal turret and one in the rear fuselage. A bombload of could be carried in vertical cells in the fuselage.

Completion of the prototype was slowed by technical problems, and in particular problems with the aircraft&#x27;s retractable undercarriage. Other issues included that the British-built Mercury engines were not cleared to use the standard Czechoslovak &quot;Bi-bo-li&quot; aircraft fuel (a mixture of 50% gasoline, 20% benzine and 30% ethanol) and had to use imported 87 octane fuel. The prototype made its first flight at Prague–Kbely Airport in April 1938. 

The prototype was transferred to the VTLU, the military technical aviation institute, for further testing in August 1938. This was generally successful, and in November that year, the aircraft was declared to have passed testing, and it was decided to order an initial batch of 10–15 aircraft, to be powered by license-built Mercury engines, under the designation B-72. Development was stopped, however, by the German Occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. The prototype was seized by the Germans and was taken to Bremen for study by Focke-Wulf before being scrapped.

<text>The University of Paris strike of 1229 took place in Paris, France. The strike occurred as a disagreement over an unpaid tab at a local tavern. The ensuing disagreement caused the deaths of several students when Queen Blanche ordered the mercenary bodyguards to punish the student riot. The students protested with a &quot;dispersion&quot;, or student strike; the masters suspended lectures. This lasted more than two years and led to several reforms in the medieval university when Pope Gregory IX issued the bull &quot;Parens scientiarum&quot;. The event demonstrates the town and gown power struggles with the Church, secular leaders, and the emerging student class and a lessening of local Church authority over the University of Paris. The university was placed squarely under direct papal patronage, part of the program to centralize the Church structure, which had intensified under Innocent III.

==Background==
The University of Paris was one of the first universities in Europe and then considered the most prestigious of the time because of its focus on theology. The University&#x27;s founding principles were defined by its teaching mission and scholasticism; these set off trends of city growth, democratic expansion, and the 12th-century intellectual renaissance. The University was established in the mid-12th century and received its official charter from the Church in 1200 recognizing its legitimacy. The Church ran it, and students were considered part of the Church; they wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure to signify they were under its protection. Students operated according to the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king&#x27;s laws or courts. That caused ongoing problems of students abusing the laws of the city, which had no direct recourse for justice and so had to appeal to ecclesiastical courts. 

Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 and staying for 6 to 12 years. They came from many regions and spoke many European languages, with all defined by their native language. Latin was the lingua franca at school. Eventually, the Masters were organized into four &quot;nations&quot; comprising the French, the Picards, the Normans, and a polyglot of nationalities (predominantly English, Germans, Scandinavian, and otherwise Central European) referred to as &quot;English&quot;. The overwhelming majority of students were from the elite or aristocratic classes of Europe, as the cost of travel and maintenance of a stay at the university, as well as basic tuition, was beyond the reach of the poor.

In 1200, a &quot;town and gown&quot; riot occurred where shortly after the provost of the city of Paris ordered a retaliation, killing several students. The group of masters at the University used this incident to acquire privileges from the king, Phillip Augustus, who feared the university would leave. Universities at this time were guilds of scholars who had no concrete setting or establishment of building, making relocating a simple move, which held great power.

==Riot==
In March 1229, on Shrove Tuesday, Paris&#x27;s pre-Lenten carnival was coming to its conclusion, similar to the modern-day Mardi Gras, when one wore masks and generally let loose. Presumably, intoxicated students wandered into a local tavern in the suburban quarter of Saint Marcel. After consuming some “sweet wine,” the students disputed the bill with the tavern owner, leading to a physical altercation. After the tavern owner called upon his ‘neighbors,’ the students were promptly beaten up and kicked out onto the street.  

The next day, Ash Wednesday, the aggrieved students returned in larger numbers armed with wooden clubs; broke into the tavern, which was closed on account of the penitential holiday, beat the taverner and destroyed the establishment. Other shops were damaged in a subsequent riot, which spilled into the streets.

Because students had benefit of clergy, which exempted them from the jurisdiction of the king&#x27;s courts, angry complaints were filed with the ecclesiastical (Church) courts. The ecclesiastical courts knew that the university tended to be very protective of its students, and fearing a split like that of Cambridge University from Oxford, they were trying to approach the matter carefully.

However, Blanche of Castile, regent of France during the minority of Louis IX, stepped in and demanded retribution. The university allowed the city guard to punish the student rioters. The city guardsmen, known for their rough nature, found a group of students and, with an unexpectedly heavy hand, killed several of them. The dead students were later rumored to be innocent of the actual riot.

==Strike==
The response from the university was an immediate strike beginning on March 27, 1229. Classes were closed, and striking students went to other universities such as Reims University, Oxford University, or University of Toulouse, returned home or found employment elsewhere. The masters ceased teachings and readings; they all went to the queen and legate and demanded justice. They believed general punishment for the whole was unjust, and only those who committed the act be punished. After the queen denied the request, the masters soon dissolved into surrounding universities. An economic strain was placed upon the student quarter of Paris, the Latin Quarter, where Latin was commonly heard in the streets. The university was a major component of the economy of Paris; generating prestige as well. 

==Resolution==
After two years of negotiations, Pope Gregory IX, an alumnus of the University of Paris, issued, on April 13, 1231, the bull &quot;Parens scientiarum&quot;, honouring the university as the &quot;Mother of Sciences&quot;, which later was called the Magna Carta of the University of Paris because it guaranteed the school independence from local authority, both ecclesiastical and secular, by placing it directly under papal patronage. The document addresses the ‘riot’ as a random occurrence stemming from the devil&#x27;s work. The Pope granted several freedoms to the university; start and end times of lectures, burying of the dead, content of lecture, and who could lecture. Pope Gregory IX, in the document, retained a strong grip on the university, minimizing heresy, and strengthening theology. Several lines dismantled masters&#x27; attempts to be philosophers; telling them to be one of God&#x27;s learned, and teach only from holy writings. The threat of suspension of lectures remained an economic lever and a tool of medieval universities when attempting to acquire rights. In the document, masters were authorized to &quot;disperse&quot; the lectures over a wide range of provocations, which ranged from &quot;monstrous injury or offense&quot; to &quot;the right to assess the rents of lodgings&quot;.

<doc id="992685" wikidata="Q4306580" url="?curid=992685" title="Music of Tokelau">
<text>The music of Tokelau occurs in the atolls of Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo. It is dominated by communal choral activity in harmony, with percussive accompaniment including log drums (&quot;pate&quot;), &quot;pokihi&quot; (wooden box) and &quot;apa&quot; (biscuit tin). Nukunonu is notable for traditional song and dance.

==History==
Nukunonu is one of the three islands of Tokelau (the other two are Atafu and Fakaofo) where, under the positive influence of the Catholic Christian missionaries, traditional music and song took positive development . Though the music and dance form was imported from Tuvalu, it was adopted into the “acculturated fatele” which has replaced the old forms. Drums were a common accompaniment in music for quite a long time. Slit gongs was also another instrument in use since 1841 that was noticed by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1843. &quot;Pokihi&quot; (mat covered boxes) is another widely seen instrument used in &quot;fatele&quot; music, which was a post European innovation seen even in 1921. Alan Thomas was the first person to study the music of Tokelau in 1980s and submit a Master of Arts thesis on &quot;fatele&quot; in 1986.

The venue, which is popular for holding music and dance performances, is known as &quot;fiafia&quot; or festival held at the meeting house where villagers congregate and the music groups arrange themselves according to their village affiliation known as (sides or halves). The performances are held in an atmosphere of fun and humor and are conducted till the elders in the group order it be stopped.

==Song and dance==
&quot;Pehe&quot; are songs of Tokelau, while are ancient songs; are dances. Together, they are popular forms of music in Tokelau. The best-known form of traditional music is &quot;fatele&quot;, a dance performed at many community gatherings and events. Each song begins with a stanza that is repeated up to a half-dozen times, followed by increased pitch and tempo near the end of the piece. This tradition is shared with the music of Tuvalu. &quot;Fetele&quot; is a song form which is an abridged and fascinating song rendering of compositions which are situation specific and sung to the text format. The community is usually aware of the singer&#x27;s capability in composing and rendering such songs. The experienced composer and singer of these songs is known as &quot;pulotu&quot;. One such &quot;pulotu&quot; who is popular among the public is Ihaia, who is not only a singer but also carpenter and fisherman, with oratory skills blended with humour.

==Songs==
&quot;Fakanau&quot; are fishing songs. &quot;Hoa&quot; are sung with lead and answering voices; &quot;tuala&quot;, wedding processions songs, are a form of &quot;hoa&quot;. &quot;Mako&quot; (love songs) are sung by an individual and include sexual or emotional phrasing. &quot;Pehe lagilagi&quot; is sung in four-part harmony while seated. &quot;Tagi&quot; are songs within tales. Funeral songs include the &quot;vale&quot; (memorial) and (laments).

==Instruments==
Drums called &quot;pasu&quot; or &quot;pabu&quot; were present in 1841 at the time of the United States Exploring Expedition, but are no longer used or even remembered. Considered unusual for Western Polynesia, the instrument was cylindrical in frame, upright in its playing position, crafted of shark&#x27;s skin, and beaten with two sticks. Slit-gongs, known as &quot;lala&quot; or &quot;lali&quot;, were also described in 1841. They were created from a hollow log and struck with a heavy beater. A smaller version of slit gongs was known as &quot;kaulalo&quot;. Another smaller slit drum, the &quot;pate&quot;, was used with handclapping or &quot;pati&quot; (slapping) during &quot;taualuga&quot; dancing. Weaving boards (&quot;papa&quot; or &quot;papafailalaga&quot;) are struck with thin sticks and produce a brittle sound. Beaten with sticks, &quot;moega&quot; (rolled mats) are used as accompaniment during &quot;mauluulu&quot; dancing. Plywood is used for crafting the &quot;pokihi&quot;, a mat-covered box; it accompanies the &quot;fatele&quot; dance. Other instruments used in Tokelau are the &quot;utete&quot; (Jew&#x27;s harp), &quot;fagufagu&quot; (flute), &quot;pu&quot; (shell trumpet), &quot;ligoligo&quot; (leaf whizzer), &quot;pu&quot; (leaf oboe), and &quot;fagufagu&quot; (slit tubes).

==Bands==
New Zealand-based band Te Vaka is composed of Tokelauans living in New Zealand, and also has members from Tuvalu and Samoa. They have achieved international commercial success. Many of their songs incorporate elements of Tokelauan music. Their music and dance style are not the traditional Pacific Ocean genre and does not just involve guitars and hula skirts, typical of the ocean region. They have recorded many albums and traveled to Australia, England and Europe. The music group has blended traditional music and contemporary styles and put the music of Tokelau as the leading group from the country. They recorded their first album in 1997 which was called the &quot;Te Vaka&quot;. The second album released in 1999 was titled &quot;Ki Mua&quot;. The music group is headed by Opetaia who is versatile, performs on guitar, percussion, sings and is also the music composer. His music was inspired by the oral tradition of the folk stories narrated by his people.

<text>Maheshwar is a town, near Khargone city in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh state, in central India. It is located on State Highway-38 (Khargone city-Barwaha- Bandheri Highway),13.5 km east of National Highway 3 (Agra-Mumbai highway) and 91 km from Indore, the commercial capital of the state. The Town lies on the north bank of the Narmada River. It was the kingdom of Chaktavartin Samrat Sahastraarjun, Kartavirya Arjuna a Heheya king. Lately, after many years, it was the capital of the Malwa during the Maratha Holkar reign till 6 January 1818, when the capital was shifted to Indore by Malhar Rao Holkar III.

==Etymology==
The word Maheshwar in Hindi means &quot;Great God, &quot;an epithet of Lord Shiva.

==History==
Writers such as HD Sankalia, PN Bose and Francis Wilford, among others, identify Maheshwar as the ancient town of Mahishmati. Also known as Minnagara to Greeko-Romans.

Maheshwar is believed to be built on the site of the ancient city of Somvanshya Shastrarjun Kshatriya, and was the capital of king Kartavirya Arjuna, (Shree Shastrarjun) who is mentioned in the Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. According to a popular legend, one day the King Sahasrarjun and his 500 wives went to the river for a picnic. When the wives wanted a vast play area, the King stopped the mighty river Narmada with his 1000 arms. While they were all enjoying themselves, Ravana flew by in his Pushpak Vimana. Downstream, when he saw the dry river bed, he thought it was an ideal place to pray to Lord Shiva. He made a Shivalinga out of the sand and began to pray. When Sahasrajuna&#x27;s wives were done playing and they stepped out of the river bed, he let the waters flow. The voluminous river flowed down sweeping Ravana&#x27;s Shivalinga along, messing up his prayers. Furious, Ravana tracked Sahasrajuna and challenged him. Armed to the hilt the mighty Ravana was in for a huge surprise. The mighty Sahasrarjuna with the 1000 arms pinned Ravana to the ground. Then he placed 10 lamps on his heads and one on his hand. After tying up Ravana, Sahasrarjuna dragged him home and tied him up to the cradle pole of his son. A humiliated Ravana stayed prisoner until his release was secured. Jamadagni rishi, Renuka Devi and Lord Parashurama with whom Kartavirya Arjuna&#x27;s story is closely associated also lived nearby.

In Mahabharata, there is a narration of an unusual tradition wherein marriage as a civil institution was not universal in Mahishmati unlike in rest of Aryavarta, which is also narrated in the Telugu-language &quot;Andhra Mahabharata&quot; in ‘Sabha parva’.

As per the legend, there was a Nishada king named Nila who ruled over Mahishmati. King Nila had a daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. So much so that Agni (lord of fire) fell in love with her which was reciprocated. The princess always used to stay near the sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And king Nila&#x27;s sacred fire, even if fanned, would not blaze until agitated by the gentle breath of her lips. Agni, assuming the form of a Brahman starts courting with the princess for long. But, one day the couple was discovered by the king, who became furious. Nila thereupon ordered the Brahman to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity flamed up in wrath and beholding the terrible flame, the king felt terrified and bent his head low on the ground. King hails Lord Agni and says he cannot punish a god who is responsible for the origin of Vedas, source of all Knowledge and Dharma. Pacified Agni then grants a boon to Nishada, and the King requests for the protection of his kingdom from any invasions. Agni swears to protect his kingdom on the condition that the king should sanctify pleasure out of pure love a legitimate action in his kingdom. Liberated from the orthodoxy of marriage as a prelude, women of Mahishmati enjoyed freedom that was then unheard of elsewhere in Arya-Varta.

Years later, after the epic war the victorious Yudhishthira plans on conducting a Yagna by winning over everyone else on Earth. Sahadeva, the youngest of Pandavas knowing that Lord Agni was protecting the Nishada kingdom, prays to Lord Agni successfully and there upon moves to Saurashtra kingdom.

Of note, even to this day, the Sahasrarjun temple at Maheshwar lights 11 lamps in honour of Lord Agni blessing the Kingdom. Alternatively, this tradition is attributed to Sahasrarjun queens humiliating captive ten-headed Ravana by lighting up candles on his foreheads.

In the late eighteenth century, Maheshwar served as the capital of the great Maratha queen Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar. She embellished the city with many buildings and public works, and it is home to her palace, as well as numerous temples, a fort, and riverfront &quot;ghats&quot; (broad stone steps which step down to the river).

Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has performed various akhand (continues) sankirtan outside the Shiva temple at Maheshwar for more than months. Even though Kripaluji was from mahu (30 km from Maheshwar), he frequently visited this place in his early life with devotees of lord Krishna to perform sankirtan on the banks of the Narmada river in Maheshwar.

==Demographics==
 India census, Maheshwar had a population of 24000. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Maheshwar has an average literacy rate of 67%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 59%. In Maheshwar, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Economy==

Maheshwar has been a centre of handloom weaving since the 5th century. Maheshwar is the home of one of India&#x27;s finest handloom fabric traditions. It is noted as a centre for weaving colourful Maheshwari sarees. It rose to popularity under the rule of strong maratha leader Queen Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar. Ahilya Bai wanted royal gifts for the royal guest. Hence weavers from Mandu and Surat were hired and Maheswari saree and turban were weaved. It is said that Ahilya Bai herself designed first saree. These sarees were worn by female members of the royal court. These saris were also gifted to royal guests. You can easily see inspiration of designs in saris in local architecture. These cotton saris are weaved with distinctive designs involving stripes, checks, and floral borders.

To save the local handloom industry Rehwa Society, an NGO founded by the Holkars, in 1979. This NGO gave women employment and revived the town&#x27;s textiles. About 130 weavers associated with the society produce over 100,000 metres of fine fabrics a year. The weaving centre is located in one of Maheshwar&#x27;s historic buildings. Rehwa Society also provides a free school for weavers&#x27; children and runs a low-cost health scheme. There are few other small local organisations involved in weaving of sarees and other fabrics.

Ahilya Fort which is now converted into a heritage hotel, founded by &#x27;Maharajkumar Shrimant Shivaji Rao Holkar&#x27; (Prince Richard Holkar of Indore), a descendant of both Ahilyabai Holkar and the only son of M.Gen. HH Maharaja Shrimant Yeshwant Rao II Holkar of Indore.

==Festivals==

Maheshwar is full of festivals and celebrations, some are:
Nag Panchami, Gudi Padava, Teez (New year celebrations according to the Hindu calendar), All Mondays of Shravan month, (DOLA of Kashivishwnath on last Monday, bhang is served as prasad of Shiva), Mahashivratri, Samoti Amavas, and all other Indian festivals. There are many visiting places like gold swing is also their and it is situated at Rajwada. Maheshwar also has the temple of Goddess Vindhyavasini Bhavani, one of the 24Shaktipeeths of Goddess Parvati.

Every year on the immediately preceding Sunday of Makar Sankranti (i.e. the Sunday just before the date when the Sun is about to enter the sign of Capricorn as per Indian Astrological / Sidereal calendar), Swaadhyaaya Bhavan Ashram (based at Mahalaxmi Nagar, Maheshwar) organizes Mahaamrityunjaya Rath Yaatraa in the town of Maheshwar. This Mahaamrityunjaya Rath Yaatraa was initiated by Shri Harvilas Aasopaa for the welfare of humanity, and is known to be the first of its kind in the world. The yatra intends to invoke blessings of Ayurved Murti Bhagwaan Sadaashiv Mahaamrityunjaya (who is regarded as the primordial and supreme doctor), and it starts from Swaadhyaaya Bhawan Ashram and culminates at the banks of the holy river Narmada.

<text>The Henry Ford (also known as the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation and Greenfield Village, and as the Edison Institute) is a history museum complex in Dearborn, Michigan, United States, within Metro Detroit. The museum collection contains the presidential limousine of John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s chair from Ford&#x27;s Theatre, Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory, the Wright Brothers&#x27; bicycle shop, the Rosa Parks bus, and many other historical exhibits. It is the largest indoor–outdoor museum complex in the United States and is visited by over 1.7 million people each year. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1981 as &quot;Edison Institute&quot;.

==Museum background==
Named for its founder, the automobile industrialist Henry Ford, and based on his efforts to preserve items of historical interest and portray the Industrial Revolution, the property houses homes, machinery, exhibits, and Americana of historically significant items as well as common memorabilia, both of which help to capture the history of life in early America. It is one of the largest such collections in the nation.

Henry Ford said of his museum:

==History==
Architect Robert O. Derrick designed the museum with a exhibit hall that extends behind the main façade. The façade spans and incorporates facsimiles of three structures from Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia – Old City Hall, Independence Hall and Congress Hall.

The Edison Institute was dedicated by President Herbert Hoover to Ford&#x27;s longtime friend Thomas Edison on October 21, 1929 – the 50th anniversary of the first successful incandescent light bulb. The attendees included Marie Curie, George Eastman, John D. Rockefeller, Will Rogers, Orville Wright, and about 250 others. The dedication was broadcast on radio with listeners encouraged to turn off their electric lights until the switch was flipped at the Museum.

The Edison Institute was, at first, a private site for educational purposes only, but after numerous inquiries about the complex, it was opened as a museum to the general public on June 22, 1933. It was originally composed of the Henry Ford Museum, Greenfield Village, and the Greenfield Village Schools (an experimental learning facility). Initially, Greenfield Village and the Henry Ford Museum were owned by the Ford Motor Company, which is currently a sponsor of the school and cooperates with the Henry Ford to provide the Ford Rouge Factory Tour. The Henry Ford is sited between the Ford Dearborn Development Center and several Ford engineering buildings with which it shares the same style gates and brick fences.

In 1970, the museum purchased what it believed to be a 17th-century Brewster Chair, created for one of the Pilgrim settlers in the Plymouth Colony, for $9,000. In September 1977, the chair was determined to be a modern forgery created in 1969 by Rhode Island sculptor Armand LaMontagne. The museum retains the piece as an educational tool on forgeries.

In the early 2000s, the museum added an auditorium to the building&#x27;s south corner. This housed an IMAX theater until January 2016 when museum management decided to change formats for the facility to better fit with its mission. The renovated theater reopened in April of that year.

==Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation==

The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation began as Henry Ford&#x27;s personal collection of historic objects, which he began collecting as far back as 1906. Today, the 12 acre (49,000 m2) site is primarily a collection of antique machinery, pop culture items, automobiles, locomotives, aircraft, and other items:

* The museum features a 4K digital projection theater, which shows scientific, natural, or historical documentaries, as well as major feature films.
* An Oscar Mayer Wienermobile
* The 1961 Lincoln Continental, SS-100-X in which President John F. Kennedy was riding when he was assassinated.
* The rocking chair from Ford&#x27;s Theatre in which President Abraham Lincoln was sitting when he was shot by John Wilkes Booth.
* George Washington&#x27;s camp bed.
* A collection of several fine 17th- and 18th-century violins including a Stradivarius.
* Thomas Edison&#x27;s alleged last breath in a sealed tube.
* Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s prototype Dymaxion house.
* The bus on which Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat, leading to the Montgomery bus boycott.
* Igor Sikorsky&#x27;s prototype helicopter.
* Fokker Trimotor airplane that flew the first flight over the North Pole.
* Bill Elliott&#x27;s record-breaking race car clocking in at over 212 MPH at Talladega in 1987
* &quot;Fairbottom Bobs&quot;, the Newcomen engine
* A steam engine from Cobb&#x27;s Engine House in England.
* A working fragment of the original Holiday Inn &quot;Great Sign&quot;
* Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway 2-6-6-6 &quot;Allegheny&quot;-class steam locomotive #1601, built by Lima Locomotive Works in Lima, Ohio. The Allegheny was the third most-powerful steam locomotive ever built, after the Union Pacific Railroad &quot;Big Boy&quot; 4-8-8-4 locomotive and the Pennsylvania Railroad Q2-class 4-4-6-4 locomotive.
*Toyota Prius sedan, the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle.

Behind the scenes, the Benson Ford Research Center uses the resources of The Henry Ford, especially the photographic, manuscript and archival material which is rarely displayed, to allow visitors to gain a deeper understanding of American people, places, events, and things. The Research Center also contains the Ford Motor Archives.

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the Henry Ford Museum exhibited a vast array of artifacts and media documenting the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s voyage and demise. The exhibit was hosted from 31 March to 30 September 2012.

===Selected exhibits===




==Greenfield Village==
Greenfield Village, the outdoor living history museum section of the Henry Ford complex, was (along with the adjacent Henry Ford Museum) dedicated in 1929 and opened to the public in June 1933. It was the first outdoor museum of its type in the nation, and served as a model for subsequent outdoor museums. Patrons enter at the gate, passing by the Josephine Ford Memorial Fountain and Benson Ford Research Center. Nearly one hundred historical buildings were moved to the property from their original locations and arranged in a &quot;village&quot; setting. The museum&#x27;s intent is to show how Americans have lived and worked since the founding of the country. The Village includes buildings from the 17th century to the present, many of which are staffed by costumed interpreters who conduct period tasks such as farming, sewing and cooking. A collection of craft buildings such as pottery, glass-blowing, and tin shops provide demonstrations while producing materials used in the Village and for sale. The Village features costumed and plain-clothed presenters to tell stories and convey information about the attractions. Some of these presenters are seasonal, such as the &quot;games on the green&quot; presenters who only operate in the summer. Greenfield Village has 240 acres (970,000 m2) of land of which only 90 acres (360,000 m2) are used for the attraction, the rest being forest, river and extra pasture for the sheep and horses.

Village homes, buildings, and attractions include:
* Noah Webster&#x27;s Connecticut home, which served as a dormitory for Yale students from 1918 to 1936, when it was obtained by Henry Ford and moved to Greenfield Village where it was restored.
* The Wright brothers&#x27; bicycle shop and home, which were bought and moved by Henry Ford in 1937 from Dayton, Ohio.
* A replica of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Menlo Park laboratory complex from New Jersey. Its reconstruction started in 1928. The buildings were laid out according to exact foundation measurements from the original site. It was furnished with original or faithful duplicates, all placed as they were originally.
* The Edison Homestead, birthplace of Thomas Edison&#x27;s father. It was built in 1816 in Vienna, Ontario, and moved to Greenfield Village in the 1930s.
* Henry Ford&#x27;s birthplace, which was moved from Greenfield and Ford roads in 1944. Henry Ford had it furnished exactly as it was during his mother&#x27;s time.
* Henry Ford&#x27;s prototype garage where he built the Ford Quadricycle.
* Harvey S. Firestone family farmhouse from Columbiana, Ohio, which was given to the Village by Harvey&#x27;s two remaining sons in 1983 to perpetuate their father&#x27;s memory. The disassembling and rebuilding process took over two years, and the farm has been operated as a working sheep farm since 1985.
* The Logan County, Illinois, courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practiced law.
* William Holmes McGuffey&#x27;s birthplace.
* Luther Burbank&#x27;s office.
* J. R. Jones General Store was built circa 1857 in Waterford Village, Michigan. It was moved to Greenfield Village in 1927 after being purchased by Henry Ford from its then-owner August V. Jacober for $700 and the agreement to rebuild a new store on its Waterford site. It was the first structure to arrive at the Greenfield Village site. The general store was placed in its permanent location facing the village green in the spring of 1929.
* Ackley Covered Bridge, a 75-foot wooden covered bridge, built in 1832 over Enlow Fork along the Greene–Washington County line in Southwestern Pennsylvania and moved to the village in 1937.
* Cape Cod Windmill, also known as the Farris mill, is considered one of the oldest in America. It was originally built in 1633 on the north side of Cape Cod. It was moved several times around Cape Cod until it was given to Henry Ford by the Ford Dealers Association, and installed in Greenfield Village in 1936.
* In 1935, a structure was added to the park and was identified as the home of Stephen Foster. The structure was identified by historians of the time as being authentic and was then deconstructed and moved &quot;piece by piece&quot; from the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Greenfield Village, Michigan. Foster&#x27;s niece insisted that it was not his birthplace, and in 1953 the claim was withdrawn.
* A 1913 Herschell-Spillman carousel with an Artizan &#x27;C&#x27; band organ with a replica Wurlitzer #153 facade converted to play Wurlitzer rolls.

There are various modes of historic transportation in the Village providing rides for visitors, which utilize authentic Ford Model Ts, a 1931 Ford Model AA bus (one of about 15 known to exist), horse-drawn omnibuses, and trains pulled by steam locomotives on the Weiser Railroad.

===Weiser Railroad===
The rail line on which the steam locomotives in Greenfield Village presently run originally consisted of a simple straight stretch of track along the northern edge of the museum property, and has been present ever since Greenfield Village was dedicated in 1929. The rail line, now named the Weiser Railroad, was later expanded into a continuous loop around the perimeter of the museum property, which was completed in stages between 1971 and 1972. This passenger line is long and has four stations. All of the railroad&#x27;s stations consist solely of single side platforms except for the station in the Railroad Junction section, which also includes the relocated Smiths Creek Depot building originally built for the Grand Trunk Railway in 1858.

The line utilizes a modern replica of a Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Railroad (DT&amp;M) roundhouse built in 1884 in Marshall, Michigan. At the time it was opened to the public in 2000, the new DT&amp;M Roundhouse replica was one of only seven working roundhouses open to the public in the United States. A hand-operated Pere Marquette Railway turntable, originally built in 1901 in Petoskey, Michigan, is also in use.

The railroad, unusual for a heritage railroad built purposely for tourism, has a direct connection to the United States National Railroad Network. The line to which it connects is a section of the Michigan Line owned by MDOT and is used by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine&quot; service, which runs between Chicago, Illinois, and Pontiac, Michigan. In the past, Amtrak&#x27;s Greenfield Village station provided direct access to Greenfield Village near the Weiser Railroad&#x27;s Smiths Creek Depot for reserved tour groups of twenty or more. It was consolidated in December 2014 with the new John D. Dingell Transit Center. The new transit center is adjacent to the Henry Ford museum complex and has a gate allowing access to the complex via a short walk.

==Signature events==

===Civil War Remembrance===
Each year the Village honors the sacrifices and achievements of those who fought in the American Civil War. The Civil War Remembrance event takes place Memorial Day weekend (Saturday–Monday) every year. An estimated 750,000 people died during the Civil War. The Civil War Remembrance is a weekend event, which includes hundreds of Union and Confederate reenactors, musicians and historic presenters. This event features more than 400 Civil War reenactors who spend the entire weekend in the Village. Greenfield Village provides many opportunities in order to learn about the Civil War: exhibits, presentations, battle reenactments, concerts, short plays, hands-on activities and Q&amp;A with historians.

===Motor Muster===
Motor Muster is one of two car shows that take place annually in Greenfield Village. Motor Muster is traditionally held on Father&#x27;s Day weekend. This event currently features cars built from 1932 to 1976, and features between 600 and 800 cars. Special attractions include car judging, and Pass in Review in which experts discuss highlights of the passing cars.

===Summer Camp===
Every summer the Henry Ford has a Summer Camp. It takes place inside Greenfield Village and the Henry Ford Museum between June and August. It is for children in grades 2–9. Each grade level has a different theme and children who participate in the Summer Camp have the opportunity to look at both the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation and Greenfield Village from different perspectives. Children participate in activities such as: apprenticeships, canoeing, glass blowing and other age-dependent activities.

===World Tournament of Historic Base Ball===
The World Tournament of Historical Base Ball takes place every year in August. Guests get to take a step back in time to 1867 as vintage base ball clubs from around the country compete by the game&#x27;s early rules in a two-day exposition of historic base ball. The clubs engage in two days of throwing, batting and competition. The event is included in Greenfield Village admission.

===Salute to America===
For four nights around Independence Day, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra performs a patriotic concert on Walnut Grove in the Village. Attendance ranges from 5000 to 9500 per evening.

===Ragtime Street Fair===
This weekend event in July was first presented in 2007 and ran annually through 2015. Ragtime Street Fair featured dozens of live performers, including the River Raisin Ragtime Revue, &quot;Perfessor&quot; Bill Edwards, Mike Montgomery, Nan Bostick, Taslimah Bey, John Remmers, and Tartarsauce Traditional Jazz Band, who celebrated the Ragtime era (ca. 1900–1917). The event also featured silent movies, phonograph demonstrations, a cake walk, a cutting contest, and a musical revue in Town Hall as well as the 1912 presidential campaign of Theodore Roosevelt. Instruction in the ragtime one-step was provided free of charge at this event.

===Old Car Festival===
The Old Car Festival takes place every year in September. The Old Car Festival has been held on the first weekend after Labor Day since 1955. The festival takes over the streets and grounds of Greenfield Village with the sights, sounds, and smells of hundreds of authentic vehicles from the 1890s through 1932. This event features 500–700 cars. Special events include car judging, Pass in Review, the gaslight tour, and car races on the Walnut Grove field. Guests can take a self-guided tour of the exposition and talk to the owners of the treasured vehicles. Visitors can watch a Model T be assembled in just minutes, attend presentations, and hear experts share information about the vintage vehicles.

===Hallowe&#x27;en in Greenfield Village===
The Village&#x27;s Halloween celebration features decorations, a headless horseman, witches, other costumed characters, treats and activities for visitors. It is held Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings in October.

===Holiday Nights===
The Christmas season has traditionally been popular in Greenfield Village. Many buildings feature period decorations and the Village is open for self-guided strolls. An ice skating rink is available. Visitors can view live entertainment and costumed presenters or ride in a horse-drawn carriage or Model T.

==Rouge Tour==
The Ford Rouge Factory Tour is a first-hand journey behind the scenes of a modern, working automobile factory. Boarding buses at the Henry Ford Museum, visitors are taken to the River Rouge Plant and Dearborn Truck Plant, an industrial complex where Ford has built cars since the Model A that once employed 100,000 people.

In 2003, the Ford Rouge Factory, the manufacturing facility for the Ford F-Series truck, reopened following extensive renovations. When it reopened in 2003, as sustainable architecture (Gold LEED Building) led by noted &#x27;green&#x27; architect William McDonough, it also opened a new state-of-the-art visitor center highlighting the factory&#x27;s sustainable aspects and educating visitors on the legacy of the historic manufacturing facility as well as the vehicle manufacturing process that takes place within the manufacturing plant. The visitor experiences, designed by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, offers two multi-screen theaters, numerous touchscreen interpretive displays and overlook the world&#x27;s largest &quot;Green&quot; roof, atop the factory. Visitors then walk through the working assembly plant.

<text>Jakub Deml (20 August 1878 – 10 February 1961) was a Czech Catholic priest and writer.

==Life==

===Childhood and youth===
Jakub Deml was born in Tasov near Třebíč, Austria-Hungary, now the Czech Republic on 20 August 1878 as a firstborn child of a small store owner Jakub Deml and his second wife Antonie Demlová, born Bělochová. His grandfather, German Jan Deml, moved to Moravia from Opatov by Moravská Třebová. In 1889 at the age of 11, Jakub was sent to a German family in Wulzeshofen by Laa in Austria where he learnt German. In the spring of 1890, Deml returned home due to his mother&#x27;s serious illness and later death. Deml studied high school in Gymnázium Třebíč where he started to publish his first works in the journal &quot;Sursum&quot;. During the year 1897 Deml published his works in &quot;Zájmy lidu&quot; (Interest of people), and in 1899 in &quot;Nový život&quot; (New life), &quot;Dvacátý věk&quot; (Twentieth century) a &quot;Museo&quot; (Museum). After high school, Deml entered a seminary and in 1902 was ordained Roman Catholic priest.

===Priesthood and early literary works===
Deml&#x27;s first post as a priest was in Kučerov by Vyškov. In 1905, Deml stopped publishing in &quot;Nový život&quot; (New life) and started to criticize catholic modernism and clericalism, which made him unpopular with many church representatives. His disputes with clergy and church authorities were slowly escalating also due to the slow implementation of the Decree of Pope Pius X. Finally for health reasons, Deml asked to be released from his duties and in 1907 retired from the priesthood. Bishop Pavel Huyn signed the release papers.

===The first republic===
Deml put high hopes in the new republican order which started in Czechoslovakia in 1918. Unfortunately even then he was running into problems with bureaucracy. He was allowed to lead a Mass but was still prohibited from preaching and confessions. The year 1918 was important for Jakub Deml as he met with Pavla Kytlicová who became his promoter. In 1922 Deml moved to his birthplace Tasov where he permanently settled. His house, designed by the famous architect Bohuslav Fuchs, served as his home until Deml&#x27;s death. During the years of 1921 and 1928 Deml was a devoted member of Sokol. In 1924 Deml in one of his speeches attacked Orel, the organization competing with Sokol and for his comments was charged with slander. In his work Deml often criticized the Czechoslovakian prezident Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. His critiques eventually led to Deml&#x27;s conflict with government officials and his work Šlépěje was confiscated. Deml&#x27;s prosecution was finally stopped by the president himself. Later in life Deml stated that he valued president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, even though he disagreed with him on many points.
The year 1929 was marked by the death of Otokar Březina. Deml&#x27;s highly controversial work &quot;Mé svědectví o Otokaru Březinovi&quot; (My Testimony about O. Březina) had many antagonists and had a negative effect on Deml&#x27;s popularity. In 1932 died Pavla Kytlicová, Deml&#x27;s good friend, publisher, and supporter. That and Deml&#x27;s troubling health strongly influenced his literary works from this time period. In 1934 Deml published one of his most famous novels &quot;Forgotten Light&quot;. Again, it received very negative criticism. A year later Deml started corresponding with Marie Rosa Junová who became his publisher until the year 1948.

===World War II===
During the World War II Deml did not publish very much and between 1942 and 1945 could not publish at all. In early 1945 the Nazi army occupied Tasov looking for members of the partisan movement. The Nazi&#x27;s captured several citizens of Tasov and kept them as hostages hoping to get information about the underground. Deml volunteered to be kept as a hostage instead of others, however shortly afterwards the Soviet Army freed the town and all hostages were released. After the war Deml was accused of collaboration with the Nazis, but for lack of evidence he was let go with a small conditional penalty. After 1948, Deml could not publish again.

===Last years===
In the 1950s Deml&#x27;s works were yet again banned. Most of his works from this time period are in the form of letters or handwritten works. In January 1961 Deml had to be hospitalized. He was released after a short period but then was hospitalized again and died on 10 February 1961 in the Třebíč hospital.

==Main works==
Deml became one of the most important Czech authors of the 1920s and 1930s. During his time his works were not very recognized, however he is now being considered a predecessor of modern literary genre, mainly surrealism.
