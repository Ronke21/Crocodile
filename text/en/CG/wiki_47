<text>The Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) was a British early electronic serial stored-program computer design by Alan Turing. Turing completed the ambitious design in late 1945, having had experience in the years prior with the secret Colossus computer at Bletchley Park. 

The ACE was not built, but a smaller version, the Pilot ACE, was constructed at the National Physical Laboratory and became operational in 1950. A larger implementation of the ACE design was the MOSAIC computer which became operational in 1955. ACE also led to the Bendix G-15 and other computers.

==Background==
The project was managed by John R. Womersley, superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The use of the word &quot;Engine&quot; was in homage to Charles Babbage and his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. Turing&#x27;s technical design &quot;Proposed Electronic Calculator&quot; was the product of his theoretical work in 1936 &quot;On Computable Numbers&quot; and his wartime experience at Bletchley Park where the Colossus computers had been successful in breaking German military codes. In his 1936 paper, Turing described his idea as a &quot;universal computing machine&quot;, but it is now known as the Universal Turing machine.

Turing was sought by Womersley to work in the NPL on the ACE project; he accepted and began work on 1 October 1945 and by the end of the year he completed his outline of his &#x27;Proposed electronic calculator&#x27;, which was the first reasonably complete design of a stored-program computer and, apart from being on a much larger scale than the final working machine, anticipated the final realisation in most important respects. However, because of the strict and long-lasting secrecy around the Bletchley Park work, he was prohibited (because of the Official Secrets Act) from explaining that he knew that his ideas could be implemented in an electronic device. The better-known EDVAC design presented in the &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot; (dated 30 June 1945), by John von Neumann, who knew of Turing&#x27;s theoretical work, received much publicity, despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas.
Turing&#x27;s report on the ACE was written in late 1945 and included detailed logical circuit diagrams and a cost estimate of £11,200. He felt that speed and size of memory were crucial and he proposed a high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 kilobytes, accessed at a speed of 1 MHz; he remarked that for the purposes required &quot;the memory needs to be very large indeed by comparison with standards which prevail in most valve and relay work, and [so] it is necessary to look for some more economical form of storage&quot;, and that memory &quot;appears to be the main limitation in the design of a calculator, i.e. if the storage problem can be solved all the rest is comparatively straightforward&quot;. The ACE implemented subroutine calls, whereas the EDVAC did not, and what also set the ACE apart from the EDVAC was the use of &quot;Abbreviated Computer Instructions,&quot; an early form of programming language. Initially, it was planned that Tommy Flowers, the engineer at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in north London, who had been responsible for building the Colossus computers, should build the ACE, but because of the secrecy around his wartime achievements and the pressure of post-war work, this was not possible.

== Pilot ACE ==

Turing&#x27;s colleagues at the NPL, not knowing about Colossus, thought that the engineering work to build a complete ACE was too ambitious, so the first version of the ACE that was built was the Pilot Model ACE, a smaller version of Turing&#x27;s original design. Turing&#x27;s assistant, Jim Wilkinson, worked on the logical design of the ACE and after Turing left for Cambridge in 1947, Wilkinson was appointed to lead the ACE group. The Pilot ACE had fewer than 1000 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) compared to about 18,000 in the ENIAC. It used mercury delay lines for its main memory. Each of the 12 delay lines was 5 feet (1.5 m) long and propagated 32 instructions or data words of 32 bits each. This ran its first program on 10 May 1950, at which time it was the fastest computer in the world; each of its delay lines had a throughput of 1 Mbit/s.

The first production versions of the Pilot ACE, the English Electric DEUCE, of which 31 were sold, were delivered in 1955.

== MOSAIC ==

A second implementation of the ACE design was the MOSAIC (Ministry of Supply Automatic Integrator and Computer). This was built by Allen Coombs and William Chandler of Dollis Hill who had worked with Tommy Flowers on building the ten Colossus computers. It was installed at the Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) at Malvern, which later merged with the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to become the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE). It ran its first trial program in late 1952 or early 1953 and became operational in early 1955. MOSAIC contained 6,480 electronic valves and had an availability of about 75%. It occupied four rooms and was the largest of the early British computers. It was used to calculate aircraft trajectories from radar data. It continued operating until the early 1960s.

==Derivatives==

The principles of the ACE design were used in the Bendix Corporation&#x27;s G-15 computer. The engineering designer was Harry Huskey who had spent 1947 in the ACE section at the NPL. He later contributed to the hardware designs for the EDVAC. The first G-15 ran in 1954 and, as a relatively small single-user machine, some consider it to be the first personal computer.

Other derivatives of the ACE include the EMI Electronic Business Machine and the Packard Bell Corporation PB 250.

<doc id="988738" wikidata="Q4016725" url="?curid=988738" title="Weohstan">
<text>Weohstan, Wēohstān or Wīhstān (Proto-Norse *&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;sacred stone&quot;, and &quot;Wǣstēn&quot;) is a legendary character who appears in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and scholars have pointed out that he also appears to be present in the Norse &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot;.

In both &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot;, Weohstan (&quot;Vésteinn&quot;) fought for his king Onela (&quot;Áli&quot;) against Eadgils (&quot;Aðils&quot;).

==&quot;Beowulf&quot;==
According to &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Weohstan is the father of Wiglaf, and he belongs to a clan called the &quot;Wægmundings&quot;. Ecgþeow, the father of Beowulf, also belonged to this clan, so Weohstan is in some degree related to Beowulf. Thus he counts Weohstan&#x27;s son Wiglaf as his kinsman.

Weohstan is said to have died of old age before the action of the later part of the poem. Weohstan is first mentioned at line 2602. We learn that he had held a Geatland estate and rights in common land which Beowulf gave to him.

When the Scylfing prince Eanmund rebelled against his uncle, Onela, the king of Sweden, Weohstan fought in the service of Onela and killed Eanmund in battle; for this Onela gave Weohstan Eanmund&#x27;s sword and armour. In his old age, Weohstan gave this sword and armour to his son Wiglaf. By that time both Weohstan and Wiglaf &quot;lived among the Geats&quot;. His name appears in several places where Wiglaf is described as &quot;the son of Weohstan&quot;.

The scholar Frederick Klaeber speculated that though Onela himself did not seek a feud with Weohstan, once Onela was dead and Eanmund&#x27;s brother Eadgils became king of the Swedes, Weohstan found it prudent to leave the service of the Scylfings, and this was how he came to be living among the Geats.

==&quot;Kálfsvísa&quot;==
In the part of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; which is called the &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot;, the name Weohstan appears in its Old Norse form &quot;Vésteinn&quot;. Moreover, he is mentioned together with his lord Onela (Áli) and enemy Eadgils (Aðils), and the section concerns the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern after which the exile suggested by Klaeber would have taken place:

The section apparently mentions Weohstan and his fellow warriors riding together with their king Onela out on the ice, where they meet Eadgils. However, the skald of the &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot; expected the listener to be familiar with these characters and mentions no more of what happened. However, as is told in passing in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and more in detail by Snorri, Eadgils won the battle.

<text>Shahid Javed Burki () (born 1938) is a Pakistani-American professional economist who has served as Vice President of the World Bank and as de facto Finance Minister of Pakistan on a caretaker basis. He has written extensively on economic development and on the political history of Pakistan.

== Early life and education ==
Burki was born on 14 September 1938, in Simla in the Punjab Province of British India (now in Himachal Pradesh, India) into a Punjabi-speaking Pathan family of the Burki tribe. Burki&#x27;s family migrated to Pakistan at the time of the Partition of India in September 1947. They settled in Rawalpindi, where his father worked as an official in the Pakistan army headquarters. Burki is a cousin of the cricketer Javed Burki.

Burki was educated at Presentation Convent High School, Rawalpindi and St Mary&#x27;s College, Rawalpindi. Upon graduation he moved to Lahore to study double majors in Physics and Mathematics at Government College University, Lahore. He received his MSc in Physics from the Punjab University in 1959. The following year he was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan and went to Christ Church, Oxford to study economics. He received his MA from Oxford in 1963 and then went to Harvard University as a Mason Fellow for graduate studies in Economics and Public Administration. He holds dual Pakistani and US nationality.

==Career at World Bank==
Burki joined the World Bank in 1974 as a Senior Economist and went on to serve in several senior positions. He was the (first) Director of the China Department (1987–1994), making him responsible for managing the World Bank&#x27;s dialogue with the Chinese authorities and supervising all of the Bank&#x27;s analytical and lending work in China. He persuaded the World Bank&#x27;s senior management, in the immediate aftermath of the Chinese authorities&#x27; repression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, that the Bank should stay actively engaged with China, a stance challenged at the time by many of the Bank&#x27;s most powerful shareholder countries. He served as the Regional Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean during 1994–1999. 

He took a leave of absence from the World Bank to serve in a caretaker role as Pakistan&#x27;s de facto Finance Minister for 67 days in 1996–1997 (exercising the responsibilities of the Finance Minister without assuming the title). He retired from the World Bank in 1999 after 25 years of service there.

== Publications ==
Burki is the author or editor of several books on Pakistan, including: &quot;Pakistan Under Bhutto&quot; (1980, Macmillan); &quot;Pakistan under the Military: Eleven Years of Zia Ul-Haq&quot; (with Craig Baxter, 1991, Westview Press); &quot;Pakistan: Fifty Years of Nationhood&quot; (1999, Westview Press); &quot;A Historical Dictionary of Pakistan&quot; (1999, Scarecrow Press); and &quot;Changing Perceptions, Altered Reality: Pakistan&#x27;s Economy under Musharraf, 1999–2006&quot; (2007, Oxford University Press, Karachi). Other publications on development include: &quot;A Study of Chinese Communes&quot; (1969, Harvard University Press); &quot;First Things First&quot; (with Paul Streeten, 1981, Oxford University Press); and &quot;Transforming Socialist Economies: Lessons from Cuba and Beyond&quot; (edited, with Daniel P. Erikson, 2005, Palgrave Macmillan).

== Other activities ==
In the past, Burki has written opinion pieces for a Pakistani newspaper (Dawn). He is currently a frequent contributor of opinion pieces to the Daily Times.

Burki is the Chairman of The Shahid Javed Burki Institute of Public Policy at NetSol (BIPP) in Lahore, Pakistan.

<text>Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities . It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning . It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management (KM) .

==History and background==
Although as early as 1998 Davenport wrote on the importance to worker productivity of understanding individual knowledge processes (cited in ), the term &quot;personal knowledge management&quot; appears to be relatively new. Its origin can be traced in a working paper by .

PKM integrates personal information management (PIM), focused on individual skills, with knowledge management (KM) in addition to input from a variety of disciplines such as cognitive psychology, management and philosophy . From an organizational perspective, understanding of the field has developed in light of expanding knowledge about human cognitive capabilities and the permeability of organizational boundaries. From a metacognitive perspective, it compares various modalities within human cognition as to their competence and efficacy . It is an underresearched area . More recently, research has been conducted to help understand &quot;the potential role of Web 2.0 technologies for harnessing and managing personal knowledge&quot; . The Great Resignation has expanded the category of knowledge workers and is predicted to increase demand for personal knowledge management in the future .

==Models==
 identified information retrieval, assessment and evaluation, organization, analysis, presentation, security, and collaboration as essential to PKM (cited in ). 

Wright&#x27;s model involves four interrelated domains: analytical, information, social, and learning. The analytical domain involves competencies such as interpretation, envisioning, application, creation, and contextualization. The information dimension comprises the sourcing, assessment, organization, aggregation, and communication of information. The social dimension involves finding and collaborating with people, the development of both close networks and extended networks, and dialogue. The learning dimension entails expanding pattern recognition and sensemaking capabilities, reflection, development of new knowledge, improvement of skills, and extension to others. This model stresses the importance of both bonding and bridging networks . 

In Nonaka and Takeuchi&#x27;s SECI model of knowledge dimensions (see under knowledge management), knowledge can be tacit or explicit, with the interaction of the two resulting in new knowledge . Smedley has developed a PKM model based on Nonaka and colleagues&#x27; model in which an expert provides direction while a community of practice provides support for personal knowledge creation . Trust is central to knowledge sharing in this model. Nonaka has returned to his earlier work in an attempt to further develop his ideas about knowledge creation 

Personal knowledge management can also be viewed along two main dimensions, personal knowledge and personal management . Zhang has developed a model of PKM in relation to organizational knowledge management (OKM) that considers two axes of knowledge properties and management perspectives, either organizational or personal. These aspects of organizational and personal knowledge are interconnected through the OAPI process (organizationalize, aggregate, personalize, and individualize), whereby organizational knowledge is personalized and individualized, and personal knowledge is aggregated and operationalized as organizational knowledge .

==Criticism==
It is not clear whether PKM is anything more than a new wrapper around personal information management (PIM). William Jones argued that only personal information as a tangible resource can be managed, whereas personal knowledge cannot . Dave Snowden has asserted that most individuals cannot manage their knowledge in the traditional sense of &quot;managing&quot; and has advocated thinking in terms of sensemaking rather than PKM . Knowledge is not solely an individual product—it emerges through connections, dialog, and social interaction (see Sociology of knowledge). However, in Wright&#x27;s model, PKM involves the application to problem-solving of analytical, information, social, and learning dimensions, which are interrelated , and so is inherently social.

An aim of PKM is &quot;helping individuals to be more effective in personal, organizational and social environments&quot; , often through the use of technology such as networking software. It has been argued, however, that equation of PKM with technology has limited the value and utility of the concept (e.g., , ).

In 2012, Mohamed Chatti introduced the personal knowledge network (PKN) model to KM as an alternative perspective on PKM, based on the concepts of a personal knowledge network and knowledge ecology .

==Skills==
Skills associated with personal knowledge management include:
* Collaboration skills. Coordination, synchronization, experimentation, cooperation and design.
* Communication skills. Perception, intuition, expression, visualization and interpretation.
* Creative skills. Imagination, pattern recognition, appreciation, innovation, inference. Understanding of complex adaptive systems.
* Information literacy. Understanding what information is important and how to find unknown information.
* Manage learning. Manage how and when the individual learns.
* Networking with others. Knowing what your network of people knows. Knowing who might have additional knowledge and resources to help you
* Organizational skills. Personal librarianship. Personal categorization and taxonomies.
* Reflection. Continuous improvement on how the individual operates.
* Researching, canvassing, paying attention, interviewing and observational &quot;cultural anthropology&quot; skills

==Tools==
Some organizations are introducing PKM &quot;systems&quot; with some or all four components:
* Content management: taxonomy processes and desktop search tools that enable employees to subscribe to, find, organize and publish information that resides on their desktops
* Just-in-time canvassing: templates and e-mail canvassing lists that enable people to identify and connect with the appropriate experts and expertise quickly and effectively
* Knowledge harvesting: software tools that automatically collect appropriate knowledge residing on subject matter experts&#x27; hard drives
* Personal productivity improvement: knowledge fairs and 101 training sessions to help each employee make more effective personal use of the knowledge, learning, and technology resources available in the context of their work

PKM has also been linked to these tools:
* Email, calendars, task managers
* Knowledge logs (k-logs)
* Social bookmarking and enterprise bookmarking
* Virtual assistants
* Wikis, including personal wikis and semantic wikis
* Web annotations

Other useful tools include stories and narrative inquiry, decision support systems, various kinds of node–link diagram (such as argument maps, mind maps, concept maps), and similar information visualization techniques. Individuals use these tools to capture ideas, expertise, experience, opinions or thoughts, and this &quot;voicing&quot; will encourage cognitive diversity and promote free exchanges away from a centralized policed knowledge repository. The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and personal content management.

The most widely used software with PKM functions are: 
* Logseq, which is FOSS
* Notion (productivity software)
* Obsidian (software)
* Roam Research
* TiddlyWiki

<doc id="988753" wikidata="Q2839863" url="?curid=988753" title="Yoga nidra">
<text>Yoga nidra () or yogic sleep in modern usage is a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping, typically induced by a guided meditation. 

A state called yoga nidra is mentioned in the Upanishads and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, while a goddess named Yoganidrā appears in the &quot;Devīmāhātmya&quot;. Yoga nidra is linked to meditation in Shaiva and Buddhist tantras, while some medieval hatha yoga texts use &quot;yoganidra&quot; as a synonym for the deep meditative state of samadhi. These texts however offer no precedent for the modern technique of guided meditation. That derives from 19th and 20th century Western &quot;proprioceptive relaxation&quot; as described by practitioners such as Annie Payson Call and Edmund Jacobson.

The modern form of the technique, pioneered by Dennis Boyes in 1973, made widely known by Satyananda Saraswati in 1976, and then by Swami Rama, Richard Miller, and others has spread worldwide. It is applied by the U.S. Army to assist soldier recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder. There is limited scientific evidence that the technique helps relieve stress.

== Historical usage ==
=== Ancient times ===
The Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, completed by the 3rd century CE, mentions a state called &quot;yoganidra&quot;, and associates it with Lord Vishnu:

The &quot;Devīmāhātmya&quot;, written around the 6th century CE, mentions a goddess whose name is Yoganidrā. The God Brahma asks Yoganidrā to wake up Vishnu to go and fight the Asuras or demigods named Madhu and Kaitabha. These early mentions do not define any yoga technique or practice, but describe the God Vishnu&#x27;s transcendental sleep in between the Yugas, the cycles of the universe, and the manifestation of the goddess as sleep itself.

=== Medieval practices ===
Yoganidra is first linked to meditation in Shaiva and Buddhist tantras. In the Shaiva text &quot;Ciñcinīmatasārasamuccaya&quot; (7.164), yoganidra is called &quot;peace beyond words&quot;; in the &quot;Mahāmāyātantra&quot; (2.19ab) it is named as a state in which perfected Buddhas may access secret knowledge. In the 11th or 12th century, yoganidra is first used in Hatha yoga and Raja yoga texts as a synonym for samadhi, a deep state of meditative consciousness where the yogi no longer thinks, moves, or breathes. The &quot;Amanaska&quot; (2.64) asserts that &quot;Just as someone who has suddenly arisen from sleep becomes aware of sense objects, so the yogi wakes up from that [world of sense objects] at the end of his yogic sleep.&quot;

By the 14th century, the &quot;Yogatārāvalī&quot; (24–26) gives a more detailed description, stating that yoganidra &quot;removes all thought of the world of multiplicity&quot; in the advanced yogi who has completely uprooted his &quot;network of Karma&quot;. He then enters the &quot;fourth state&quot;, namely turiya or samadhi, beyond the usual states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, &quot;that special thoughtless sleep, which consists of [just] consciousness.&quot; The 15th century &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā&quot; goes further, stating (4.49) that &quot;One should practice Khecarī Mudrā until one is asleep in yoga. For one who has achieved Yoganidrā, death never occurs.&quot; Khecarī Mudrā is the Hatha yoga practice of folding the tongue back so that it reaches inside the nasal cavity, where it can enable the yogi to reach samadhi. In the 17th century &quot;Haṭha Ratnāvalī&quot; (3.70), Yoganidrasana is first described. It is an asana or yoga pose where the legs are wrapped around the back of the neck. The text says that the yogi should sleep in this position, which &quot;bestows bliss&quot;. These texts view yoganidra as a state, not a practice in itself.

== Modern usage ==
=== Western &quot;relaxationism&quot; ===
The yoga scholar Mark Singleton states that while relaxation is a primary feature of modern Western yoga, its relaxation techniques &quot;have no precedent in the pre-modern yoga tradition&quot;, but derive mostly from 19th and 20th century Western &quot;proprioceptive relaxation&quot;. This prescriptive approach was described by authors such as the &quot;relaxationist&quot; Annie Payson Call in her 1891 book &quot;Power through Repose&quot;, and the Chicago psychiatrist Edmund Jacobson, the creator of progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback, in his 1934 book &quot;You Must Relax!&quot;.

=== Dennis Boyes ===
In 1973, French yoga advocate Dennis Boyes published his book &quot;Le Yoga du sommeil éveillé; méthode de relaxation, yoga nidra&quot; (&quot;The Yoga of Waking Sleep: method of relaxation, yoga nidra&quot;). This is the first known usage of &quot;yoga nidra&quot; in a modern sense. In the book, Boyes makes use of relaxation techniques including the direction of attention to each part of the body:

The French journal &quot;Revue 3e Millénaire&quot;, reviewing Boyes&#x27;s approach in 1984, wrote that Boyes proposes relaxation in order to &quot;reach the state of emptiness&quot;. The person thus imperceptibly moves to a stage where relaxation becomes meditation and can remain there once the mind&#x27;s obsession with external objects or thoughts is removed.

=== Satyananda ===
In modern times, Satyananda Saraswati claimed to have experienced yoga nidra when he was living with his guru Sivananda Saraswati in Rishikesh. In 1976, he constructed a system of relaxation through guided meditation, which he popularized in the mid-20th century. He explained yoga nidra as a state of mind between wakefulness and sleep that opened deep phases of the mind, suggesting a connection with the ancient tantric practice called nyasa, whereby Sanskrit mantras are mentally placed within specific body parts while meditating on each part (of the bodymind). The form of practice taught by Satyananda includes eight stages (internalisation, resolve (sankalpa), rotation of consciousness, breath awareness, manifestation of opposites, creative visualization, repeated resolve (sankalpa), and externalisation). Satyananda used this technique, along with the suggestion, on the child who was to become his successor, Niranjanananda Saraswati, from age four. He claimed to have been taught several languages by this method.

Satyananda&#x27;s multi-stage yoga nidra technique is not found in ancient or medieval texts. However, the yoga scholars Jason Birch and Jacqueline Hargreaves note that there are analogues for several of his yoga nidra activities.

Yoga nidra in this modern sense is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions. This state of consciousness is different from meditation, in which concentration on a single focus is required. In yoga nidra the practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the 5 senses (pratyahara) with four senses internalised, that is, withdrawn, and only hearing still connects to any instructions given.

=== Swami Rama ===
Swami Rama taught a form of yoga nidra (in a broad sense), which involves an exercise called shavayatra, &quot;inner pilgrimage [through the body]&quot;, which directs the attention around &quot;61 sacred points of the body&quot; during relaxation in shavasana, corpse pose. A second exercise, shithali karana, is said to induce &quot;a very deep state of relaxation&quot;, and is described as a preliminary for yoga nidra (in a narrow sense). It, too, is performed in Shavasana, involving exhalations imagined as directed from the crown of the head to different points around the body, each repeated 5 or 10 times. The yoga nidra exercise involves directed breathing on the left side, then the right side, then in Shavasana. In Shavasana, the attention is directed to the eyebrow, throat, and heart centers or chakras.

=== Richard Miller ===
The Western pioneer of yoga as therapy, Richard Miller, has developed the use of yoga nidra for rehabilitating soldiers in pain, using the Integrative Restoration (iRest) methodology. Miller worked with Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the United States Department of Defense studying the efficacy of the approach. According to &quot;Yoga Journal&quot;, &quot;Miller is responsible for bringing the practice to a remarkable variety of nontraditional settings,&quot; which includes &quot;military bases and in veterans&#x27; clinics, homeless shelters, Montessori schools, Head Start programs, hospitals, hospices, chemical dependency centers, and jails.&quot; The iRest protocol was used with soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Surgeon General of the United States Army endorsed Yoga Nidra as a complementary alternative medicine (CAM) for chronic pain in 2010.
=== Post-lineage yoga nidra ===
In 2021, the yoga teachers Uma Dinsmore-Tuli and Nirlipta Tuli jointly published a &quot;declaration of independence for Yoga Nidrā Shakti&quot;. In it, they stated that yoga nidra had become commodified and promoted by commercial organisations for profit; that abuse had taken place within those organisations; and that the organisations had propagated origin stories for yoga nidra &quot;that privilege their own founders&quot; and exclude or neglect older roots of the practice. They state their shock at abuses by Satyananda, Swami Rama, Amrit Desai, and Richard Miller. They invite practitioners and teachers to learn about the history of yoga nidra outside organisational boundaries and to work without &quot;trademarked versions&quot; of the practice.

== Reception ==

The Mindful Yoga teacher Anne Cushman states that &quot;This body-sensing journey [that I teach in Mindful Yoga] ... is one variation of the ancient practice of Yoga nidra ... and of the body-scan technique commonly used in the Buddhist Vipassana tradition.&quot; 

The cultural historian Alistair Shearer writes that the name yoga nidra is an umbrella term for different systems of &quot;progressive relaxation or &#x27;guided meditation&#x27;.&quot; He comments that Satyananda promoted his version of yoga nidra, claiming it was ancient, when its connections to ancient texts &quot;seem vague at best&quot;. Shearer writes that other teachers have defined yoga nidra as &quot;the state of conscious sleep&quot; in which inner awareness is maintained, without reference to Satyananda&#x27;s method of progressive relaxation by directing attention to different parts of the body. Shearer attributes this &quot;inner lucidity&quot; to the &quot;buddhi&quot; (intellect, literally &quot;wakefulness&quot;) of Sankhya philosophy. He compares &quot;buddhi&quot; to the &quot;intellect&quot; discussed by Saint Augustine and the Apostolic Fathers at about the same time as Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutra&quot;.

== Scientific evidence ==
Scientific evidence for the action of yoga nidra is patchy. Parker (2019) conducted a single-observation study of a famous yogi; in it, Swami Rama demonstrated conscious entry into NREM delta wave sleep through yoga nidra, while a disciple produced delta and theta waves even with eyes open and talking. A therapeutic model was developed by Datta and Colleagues (2017) and the same appeared to be useful for insomnia patients. Datta and colleagues (2022) report a beneficial effect of yoga nidra on the sleep of forty-five male athletes, noting that sportsmen often have sleep problems. Their small randomised controlled trial found improvements in subjective sleep latency and sleep efficiency with four weeks of yoga nidra compared to progressive muscular relaxation (used as the control).

Primary research, sometimes informal, on a small scale, and without strictly controlled trials, has been conducted on various aspects of yoga nidra. These have made tentative findings of benefits to mind and body such as increased dopamine release in the brain, improved heart rate variability, reduced blood pressure, reduced anxiety, and improved self-esteem.

<doc id="988757" wikidata="Q444309" url="?curid=988757" title="Ultra Naté">
<text>Ultra Naté (born March 20, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, DJ and promoter who has achieved success on the pop charts with songs such as &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; (as part of Stars on 54), and &quot;Automatic&quot;.

Virtually all of her singles have reached the Top 10 of the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. Such singles include &quot;Show Me&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Get It Up (the Feeling)&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s the Only Drug&quot;, and her number-one hits &quot;Automatic&quot;, &quot;Give it All You Got&quot; featuring Chris Willis, &quot;Waiting On You&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves the Night&quot;. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; ranked her as the 12th most successful dance artist of all-time.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, United States, Naté displayed her singing talent at an early age. Growing up, she enjoyed a wide variety of music; she enjoyed listening to artists such as Marvin Gaye and Boy George, who Naté later said helped her become more open to being more experimental with her style and production of music.

She is best known for her 1990s dance crossover track, &quot;Free&quot;. The 1998 cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, with Amber and Jocelyn Enriquez as Stars on 54, was a minor mainstream American hit. It reached #52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and #3 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Though she has had club success in the United States, she has found the majority of her singles and, especially, album sales success in Europe.

===Career===
Ultra Naté began her recording career on a major label, Warner Bros. Records, signed through its British offices. Through it, she released her first two albums. Her debut album, &quot;Blue Notes in the Basement&quot; (1991) was created along with the Basement Boys and it featured the singles &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot;, &quot;Deeper Love (Missing You)&quot;, &quot;Is It Love&quot;, and the gospel-tinged &quot;Rejoicing&quot;.

In 1993, the alternative dance/house &quot;One Woman&#x27;s Insanity&quot; was released. Although it still featured the Basement Boys&#x27; production on several tracks, this time Ultra found herself working with Nellee Hooper, and D-Influence. At a time when soulful house music performers such as Robin S and Crystal Waters were scoring cross-over Top Ten Pop singles, it was believed that Ultra Naté would score a similar level of commercial success. Mainstream sales however were not achieved even though &quot;Show Me&quot; received moderate mainstream pop radio airplay. Singles included &quot;How Long&quot;, &quot;Show Me&quot; (her first song to reach the top position on the US Dance charts) and &quot;Joy&quot;. However, neither release sold very well, and she was dropped from the label.

In 1995, Ultra Naté contributed the song &quot;Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)&quot; to the soundtrack of the independent film &quot;Party Girl&quot; starring Parker Posey. The single was commercially released by the King Street Sounds label.

When Warner Bros. tried to push her in another direction, Ultra Naté left the major label and moved to the independent dance label, Strictly Rhythm. It was here that &quot;Free&quot;, her biggest mainstream hit, was released in 1997. The song, co-written by Naté, Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone while production was held by both Springsteen and Ciafone, enjoyed heavy airplay throughout the summer, not only in clubs, but on rhythmic and mainstream radio stations in America and Europe. &quot;Free&quot; peaked at number 75 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It became a substantial hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, helping its parent album &#x27;Situation: Critical&#x27; reach number seventeen on the UK Albums Chart. 
It was also successful in Canada, where it peaked at number ten on the Canadian Singles Chart.

It was with this album that Ultra Naté&#x27;s greatest commercial success was achieved, particularly in Europe, where singles such as &quot;Found a Cure&quot; (No. 6 in the UK), and &quot;New Kind of Medicine&quot; (No 14 UK) also charted.

In 1998, a new single &quot;Pressure&quot; was released internationally. Taken from the soundtrack to the film &quot;The 24 Hour Woman&quot;, it contained three club mixes. The original version of the track was found on &#x27;Situation: Critical&quot; but listed as &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;.

Her follow-up album &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, which was released in 2001, featured the production work of artists such as Attica Blues, 4 Hero, and Mood II Swing. Four singles were released: &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Get It Up (The Feeling)&quot;, &quot;Twisted&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Understand It&quot;.

Naté contributed the song &quot;Wonderful Place&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation &quot;Keep Hope Alive: A Lifebeat Benefit Compilation&quot;. Additionally, in 2004, she released the singles &quot;Feel Love&quot;, &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;, &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot; (released as &quot;Ultra Devoted featuring Ultra Naté and Gerry DeVeaux&quot;), and a new version of &quot;Free&quot; that features twelve new mixes. In 2005, she collaborated with Gaudino and released the single &quot;Bitter Sweet Melody&quot;. Later in the same year she found herself again on the charts, when her featured vocals on the Stonebridge single &quot;Freak On&quot; became a successful dance hit. She also performed on the British show &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot;.

Having become a mother for the first time in the fall of 2005, Naté released her fifth album &quot;Grime, Silk, &amp; Thunder&quot; on her newly created imprint Blufire in partnership with Tommy Boy Records. The first single released was &quot;Love&#x27;s the Only Drug&quot;, which became available through the US iTunes Store August 8, 2006 and reached number two on the American Hot Dance Club Play and made the Top 30 on the Hot Dance Airplay chart. The second single &quot;Automatic&quot; (a cover version of the Pointer Sisters hit) reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart (the week ending April 28, 2007). It also received airplay in the Rhythmic/Dance format radio where it reached the Top 30 of most playlists in this radio format. Following Automatic, Ultra released &quot;Give It All You Got&quot; which features Chris Willis in Dec 2007. The song hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Music/Club Play charts the week ending February 23, 2008.

In mid-2009 it was announced that US singer Michelle Williams, previously of Destiny&#x27;s Child has collaborated on a song with Ultra called &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting On You&quot;, for use on both of their next studio albums. In 2010 Ultra has released a Bob Sinclar remix of her hit &quot;Free&quot; on Strictly Rhythm. &quot;Give It 2 U&quot; in collaboration with Quentin Harris for his album &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. She also released &quot;Destination&quot; in collaboration with Tony Moran which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Dance Play chart. &quot;Destination&quot; was the second single off Tony&#x27;s album, Mix Magic Music.

In 2010 she released an EP titled &quot;Things Happen At Night&quot; featuring Ultra&#x27;s pop and soul melodies and vocals over percussive club beats done by Unruly productions. January 2011 is saw the release of Ultra&#x27;s next single with Strictly Rhythm on her Deep Sugar label imprint called &quot;Turn It Up&quot; with a music video directed by Leo Herrera. &quot;Turn It Up&quot; was the first single to be released from her sixth studio album titled &quot;Hero Worship&quot;.

In September 2011, she submitted the song, &quot;My Love&quot; to represent Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan. However, though close, the song failed to reach the final.

In 2013, she held a residency spot at Cafe Ole at Space, Ibiza. Her spirited presence has graced the stages of New York&#x27;s massive Summer Stage in Central Park, Nile Rodgers acclaimed FOLD Festival sharing the stage with the likes of CHIC, Duran Duran, Pharrell and Beck to Lincoln Center&#x27;s annual Midnight Summer Swing and numerous Pride events around the world.

Ultra&#x27;s 2017 album collaboration, &quot;Ultra Naté &amp; Quentin Harris as Black Stereo Faith,&quot; reached the iTunes Top 10 upon release.

<doc id="988762" wikidata="Q2171647" url="?curid=988762" title="X-class submarine">
<text>The X class was a World War II midget submarine class built for the Royal Navy during 1943–44. It was substantially larger than the original Chariot manned torpedo.

Known individually as X-Craft, the vessels were designed to be towed to their intended area of operations by a full-size &quot;mother&quot; submarine – usually one of the T class or S class – with a passage crew on board, the operational crew being transferred from the towing submarine to the X-Craft by dinghy when the operational area was reached, and the passage crew returning with the dinghy to the towing submarine. Once the attack was over, the X-Craft would rendezvous with the towing submarine and then be towed home.

Range was limited primarily by the endurance and determination of their crews, but was thought to be up to 14 days in the craft or , after suitable training. Actual range of the X-Craft itself was surfaced and at submerged.

==Specification==
The craft was about long, maximum diameter and displaced surfaced and submerged. Propulsion was by a 4-cylinder Gardner 4LK 42 hp diesel engine, converted from a type used in London buses and a 30 hp electric motor, giving a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of about one third of that. The crew initially numbered threecommander, pilot and ERA (Engine Room Artificer, i.e. engineer), but soon a specialist diver was added, for whom an airlock, known as a &quot;wet and dry&quot; compartment, was provided. The ERA, usually a Navy Chief Petty Officer, operated and maintained the machinery in the vessel.

The weapons on the &quot;X-Craft&quot; were two side-cargoes – explosive charges held on opposite sides of the hull with two tons of amatol in each. The intention was to drop these on the sea bed underneath the target and then escape. The charges were detonated by a time fuse. The craft were fitted with electromagnets to evade detection by anti-submarine detectors on the sea bed and also with sonar and a periscope.

==Service==
A number of development craft were built before it was felt that a feasible weapon had been produced. The first operational craft was &quot;X3&quot; (or HM S/M X.3), launched on the night of 15 March 1942. Training with the craft began in September 1942, with &quot;X4&quot; arriving in October. In December 1942 and January 1943, six of the &quot;5-10&quot; class began to arrive, identical externally but with a completely reworked interior.

These operations were part of a longer series of frogman operations; see human torpedo.

The operational base and training establishment was at the former Kyles Hydro Hotel at Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland.

===Major operations===

Their first deployment was Operation Source in September, 1943, an attempt to neutralise the heavy German warships based at Kåfjord, Nordkapp in Northern Norway. Six X-Craft were used but only two successfully laid charges (under the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;). Two were lost while being towed to Norway; X8 began taking water and was scuttled, and X9 sank with her crew after the towline parted. Only &quot;X6&quot; and &quot;X7&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Donald Cameron and Lieutenant Godfrey Place respectively, were successful in placing their charges although their crews were captured (there is some evidence that &quot;X5&quot; also placed her charges; &quot;X10&quot; also penetrated the anchorage but was unable to attack and the crew were picked up by another submarine). &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was badly damaged, crippled, and out of action until May 1944; it was destroyed on 12 November 1944 by Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism in Tromsø, Norway.

For this action, Cameron and Place were awarded the Victoria Cross, whilst Robert Aitken, Richard Haddon Kendall, and John Thornton Lorimer received the Distinguished Service Order and Edmund Goddard the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. The commander of &quot;X8&quot;, John Elliott Smart, was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). There was a possibility that &quot;X5&quot; had also successfully planted explosive side charges before being destroyed, but this was never conclusively proven; its commander Henty-Creer was not awarded a medal, but was mentioned in dispatches.

The lost boats were replaced early in 1944 with &quot;X20&quot; to &quot;X25&quot; and six training-only craft.

Submarines &quot;X20&quot; to &quot;X25&quot; were dispatched to Bergen, Norway. On 15 April 1944, in Operation Guidance &quot;X24&quot; attacked the Laksevåg floating dock. &quot;X22&quot; was intended for the mission, but had been accidentally rammed during training and sunk with all hands. &quot;X24&quot; made the approach and escaped successfully, but the charges were placed under , a merchant vessel alongside the dock; the ship was sunk but the dock suffered only minor damage. On 11 September the operation was repeated by &quot;X24&quot;; this time she succeeded in sinking the dock.
X-Craft were involved in the preparatory work for &quot;Overlord&quot;. Operation Postage Able was planned to take surveys of the landing beaches with &quot;X20&quot;, commanded by Lt KR Hudspeth, spending four days off the French coast. Periscope reconnaissance of the shoreline and echo-soundings were performed during daytime. Each night, &quot;X20&quot; would approach the beach and 2 divers would swim ashore. Soil samples were collected in condoms. The divers went ashore on two nights to survey the beaches at Vierville-sur-Mer, Moulins St Laurent and Colleville-sur-Mer in what became the American Omaha Beach. On the third night, they were due to go ashore off the Orne Estuary (Sword Beach), but by this stage fatigue (the crew and divers had been living on little more than benzedrine tablets) and the worsening weather caused Hudspeth to shorten the operation, returning to &quot;Dolphin&quot; on 21 January 1944. Hudspeth received a bar to his DSC.

&quot;X20&quot; and &quot;X23&quot;, each with a crew of five, acted as navigational beacons to help the D-Day invasion fleet land on the correct beaches (Operation Gambit), as part of the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPP). The craft were also equipped with a radio beacon and echo sounder to help direct Canadian and British ships to the suitable positions on Sword and Juno beaches. Oxygen bottles on both craft enabled the crews to remain submerged for extended periods during this operation, 64 hours of the 76 total hours at sea.

===Legacy===

The only remaining intact example of an X-Craft, X24, was transferred from HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, where she had been on display since 1981, to the Royal Navy Submarine Museum nearby in 1987. Operations continued in the Far East with the revised XE class submarines.

==X-craft and crews==

* &quot;X3&quot; – unofficially named &quot;Piker 1&quot;, was lost on 4 November 1942 in Loch Striven due to a leaking engine valve. All crew escaped by utilizing their Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus.

==Builders==

The numbering sequence of the X class began with &quot;X3&quot; because the designations &quot;X1&quot; and &quot;X2&quot; had already been used previously – &quot;X1&quot; had been a one-off submarine cruiser design from the 1920s while &quot;X2&quot; had been assigned to a captured Italian submarine.

==Surviving examples==

* X24 – the only one to have seen combat and survive is at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, Gosport
* The remains of two XT-class craft are present on the beach at Aberlady Bay in East Lothian, Scotland. They were towed there in 1946 and moored to a large concrete block at the low tide level and were used as targets for aircraft. Much of the structure remains, semisubmerged in the sand, and can be reached at low spring tides.
* X51 &quot;Stickleback&quot;, a Stickleback-class of 1954, is on display at the Scottish Submarine Centre in Helensburgh, Scotland.

==In the media==
This type of midget submarine was portrayed in the 1955 war film, &quot;Above Us the Waves&quot;, featuring John Mills, which was based on both Operation Source and the earlier &quot;Chariot&quot; attacks on the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

An X-class submarine – marked as &quot;X2&quot; – features in the 1959 film &quot;The Giant Behemoth&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Behemoth the Sea Monster&quot;).

This class of submarine was later featured in the 1968 movie &quot;Submarine X-1&quot; starring James Caan as a Canadian Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer who after losing his submarine and fifty crew members in a battle with a German ship during World War II, gets a second chance training crews to take part in a raid using midget subs.

A 1976 Douglas Reeman novel, &quot;Surface with Daring&quot;, features a fictionalized account of X-class midget submarines, especially XE-16 and its crew, performing several highly secret operations in occupied Europe.

A 2006 Alexander Fullerton novel, &quot;The Gatecrashers&quot;, features a fictionalized account of X-class midget submarines, including &quot;X-12&quot; piloted by one of the protagonists, that lays explosive charges to damage the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

<text>John James Lawson, 1st Baron Lawson, PC (16 October 1881 – 3 August 1965) was a British trade unionist and a Labour Party politician. A miner and later Member of Parliament in County Durham, he served in the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Clement Attlee. In 1950 he was ennobled as Baron Lawson, of Beamish in the County of Durham, and is sometimes referred to as Lord Lawson of Beamish.

==Background==
Lawson was born in the port town of Whitehaven, Cumberland, and grew up in the nearby village of Kells. His father John Lawson was a sailor and miner who had begun working in a colliery by the age of nine, sailed round the world by eleven, and later served in the Royal Naval Reserve. His mother, Lisbeth Savage, was a strict disciplinarian. Both parents were illiterate and the family lived in extremes of poverty common at the time. At the age of three, Lawson was sent to the local National School, Glass House School. Here, he learned to read, developing an avid interest in popular fiction as a boy, and moving on to literary fiction and poetry in later years. When he was six his family moved to the village of Flimby, near the towns of Maryport and Workington. The family now included ten children: five boys and five girls. Two of his elder brothers worked with his father at the local colliery and the family was no longer on the breadline. A year later, they moved to County Durham, where the working members were employed at Boldon Colliery. The family joined the Co-operative Society, and were committed trade unionists, active in the Durham miners&#x27; strike of 1892. Outside of school, Jack Lawson&#x27;s time was consumed with chores and he often looked after his youngest brother, Will, born in 1890.

Lawson eagerly began work in the colliery the day after he turned twelve. He started as a trapper, opening and shutting doors for the drivers, working a ten-hour day. He was paid ten pence per day, and his life greatly improved – he was treated as an adult now. After a few months he became a driver, with his own pony. After a couple more years, he began off-hand work, braking inclines and attending to the signalling bells. He began attending union meetings, including the annual Durham Miners&#x27; Gala, where in later years he met the likes of Will Crooks, Ellen Wilkinson, Ernest Bevin and George Lansbury. At eighteen he became a putter and began speaking and working for the union. With five members of the family now working at the colliery, the Lawsons had a higher status and moved into a house closer to the pit, with a front room. Throughout this period he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the Methodist Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and &quot;The Clarion&quot;, Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from Sunderland who was staying with friends at Boldon. They were married in February 1906.

==Trade Unionist==
In 1904, Lawson joined the newly founded branch of the Independent Labour Party at Boldon. He was invited to be a speaker, but initially refused, unsure of his own ability. He discovered a socialist bookshop in Newcastle, where he met many like-minded people, and read books on economics and society, including those of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin. He became a hewer that year, working at the coal-face, and within a few months was elected as an assistant checkweighman. He had no ambition for work beyond being a hewer, but he did want to continue his education. He began teaching boys who worked at the colliery and then helped to set up a school for adults in two disused colliery houses.

In 1905 Lawson became an active speaker for the ILP, expounding socialism and the Labour Representation Committee to the miners of Durham, who had traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Later that year, Lawson joined a correspondence class with Ruskin College, Oxford. The following spring, Lawson received a letter from the college offering him six months&#x27; scholarship if he could find the money to pay for the other six months. This was a significant expense that would be compounded by living costs, and as Lawson was determined that he would only ever work as a miner there was no obvious advantage to university study. Canon William Moore Ede, a county councillor and later Dean of Worcester, convinced him to go and helped raise some of the fees; Lawson and his wife sold their furniture and saved what they could, and the rest was paid by his parents. His wife moved to Oxford with him, finding work and accommodation as a servant in a series of homes. Amongst his tutors, Hastings Lees-Smith, the vice-principal of Ruskin and a lecturer on economics, had a particular influence on Lawson.

At the end of the year, Lawson was offered a further six months scholarship on the same terms, and after working at Boldon over the winter to raise the money he began his second year of study in February 1908. Halfway through that year, he was told that the College Council had decided to extend his scholarship to cover the rest of the full year. It was suggested he should enter Manchester College, Oxford, to study for a degree. He was grateful but refused, not wanting a professional career; three months later, he returned to Boldon. He became well known around the county, as a speaker for both the ILP and the union. He was a negotiator for his union lodge and a delegate to the Miner&#x27;s Council at Durham.

In 1909, he was invited by the union to run for Durham County Council, but he was not yet on the electoral register and was ineligible to stand. Pete Curran, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Jarrow, had made Lawson his election agent: this was unpaid, hard work, and consumed all of Lawson&#x27;s spare time during campaigns, as he travelled to and around Jarrow division. Curran was hit by ill health in the January 1910 general election and had trouble campaigning. He lost by less than 100 votes and died within a week. The Lawson&#x27;s first daughter, Irene, was born later that year. Whilst campaigning in the general election in December, Lawson was asked by friends in Chester-le-Street to stand for the position of checkweighman at Alma Colliery. Elected and paid by hewers, as a checkweighman he would be responsible for ensuring miners received the full amount due for the coal they dug and would act as their legal representative. Lawson was reluctant to leave manual work, but allowed his name to go forward. Labour lost Jarrow again; at the same time, the miners at Alma, elected him almost unanimously.

==Member of Parliament==
Two years after moving there, Lawson was elected to the County Council for the Chester-le-Street division. He wrote a pamphlet campaigning for minimum wage for miners and was a leading figure in Durham during the miners&#x27; strike of 1912 on this issue. He and his wife had a second daughter, Edna, while his brother Will, whom he had tutored, took a diploma in Economics and Political Science at Ruskin. In 1913 he was a delegate to the Miner&#x27;s International in Carlsbad. Journeying through Leipzig and Dresden, he saw the growing Prussian army, and once in the Balkans witnessed some of the troubles that would spark the first World War. When war broke out in 1914, Will Lawson became an officer in the Durham Light Infantry. Jack Lawson followed his example, volunteering for service; experienced with horses, he was assigned as a driver with the Royal Field Artillery, serving in France. Another brother, Tom, joined the Border Regiment. Will Lawson was sent to Ypres in January 1915, and died in battle thirteen months later on 27 March 1916.

Following the end of the war, Jack Lawson was granted temporary leave to contest the Seaham division of Durham in the 1918 general election; he campaigned against war reparations and won only a third of the votes against a coalition candidate. After that he was sent to Clipstone in Derbyshire, where he was demobbed. Returning to work at Alma Colliery and as a county councillor, he started to have health problems and was sick during the council elections the following year. The Labour Party, which entered the election with around a dozen out of one hundred councillors, won control of the council.

Later in 1919, John Taylor, Labour MP for Chester-le-Street since 1906 and a friend of Lawson&#x27;s, resigned his seat due to ill health. Though reluctant to risk leaving Durham and the colliery for London and Parliament, Lawson was persuaded to stand for Labour in the by-election. He was sponsored by the Durham Miner&#x27;s Association and won with a majority of eleven thousand, entering the House of Commons in November 1919.

Ramsay MacDonald appointed Lawson as Financial Secretary to the War Office in the 1924 Labour government. He worked alongside Clement Attlee, and the two came to enjoy a very firm friendship and mutual admiration. Both felt odd, controlling generals they&#x27;d served under a few years before, but the generals liked them, considering them less idle than their predecessors. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour in the 1929 Labour government, but refused MacDonald&#x27;s invitation to join the National Government following the split in 1931.

The 1931 general election was disastrous for Labour, and Lawson was one of only two Durham Labour MPs to keep their seats, out of seventeen who won there in the 1929 election. During the 1930s, Lawson supplemented his income as an MP by writing. He published his autobiography, &quot;A Man&#x27;s Life&quot;, in 1932, intended as a record of the family life of miners. He followed this with a novel about miners, &quot;Under the Wheels&quot;, and biographies of Peter Lee and Herbert Smith. He also wrote for newspapers and periodicals.

==Elder Statesman==
When Attlee became leader of the Labour Party in 1935, he created a new Defence Committee for the party, appointing Lawson along with A. V. Alexander and Manny Shinwell. In April 1936, Lawson wrote a column in the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; criticising the National Government&#x27;s policy of appeasement: Entitled &quot;Watch Winston&quot;, it predicted the government&#x27;s policy of appeasement would result in war, and that Winston Churchill, at that time a marginal figure, would return to become prime minister. In April 1939, during the build-up to the Second World War, Sir John Anderson, the Home Secretary, appointed Lawson as Deputy Commissioner for Civil Defence in the Northern Region. This region covered Durham, Northumberland and the North Riding; Lawson oversaw preparations for aerial bombardment and possible invasion, and the organisation of shelter and relief when bombing began. Lawson later refused the offer of a position in government to continue his work in civil defence. His third daughter, Alma, was a gunner in the ATS; his son Clive, born in 1932, was killed aged 9 by a bomb on 1 May 1942.

With Labour&#x27;s victory in the general election of July 1945, Lawson was appointed Secretary of State for War, with a seat in Attlee&#x27;s Cabinet. During the closing months of the war, he travelled thousands of miles, visiting troops in India and the Far East, and speaking at military functions and mass meetings. His refusal to stick to the scheduled, whitewashed routes on official visits, insistence on seeing everything for himself, and willingness to stop and listen to everyone he met, made him unpopular with senior officers. However, he was very popular with soldiers, who were glad that one of their own was now in the War Office. Lawson oversaw planning for post-war operations, including the occupation of Germany, and for the mass demobilisation, ensuring it happened quickly and smoothly. He also served as one of Attlee&#x27;s key allies in the Cabinet, particularly during early conflicts with Herbert Morrison. However, from the summer of 1946, Lawson found his job increasingly difficult: he suffered severe health problems and had to go into hospital, retiring from the front bench in October. Alan Brooke the wartime Army CIGS found Lawson charming and a religious man of high principles; but he &quot;had not the faintest idea&quot; of what his job required, and did not read papers sent to him. 

In 1949, on Attlee&#x27;s recommendation, the King appointed Jack Lawson as Lord Lieutenant of Durham. He resigned from parliament in December 1949 on appointment as vice-chairman of the National Parks Commission, he was made a hereditary peer as Baron Lawson, of Beamish in the County of Durham, in March 1950.

Lords Lieutenant are unpaid, and Lawson, one of the first working-class men to hold such a position, received income support. He attended the House of Lords but did not take a front-bench position. Still a close friend of Attlee, he provided moral support during struggle to hold the Labour Party together during the 1950s. His protégé, Sam Watson, became General Secretary of the Durham Miners and one of the most influential trade unionists in the party.
Lawson retired as Lord Lieutenant in 1958 and died in 1965, at the age of 83. His hereditary peerage became extinct on his death.

The Lord Lawson of Beamish Community School is named in his honour. He was for years on friendly terms with the historian Sir Arthur Bryant, despite the latter&#x27;s more right-wing outlook.

==Political career==

===Entry into politics and first Sharif ministry===
Dar began his political career in the late 1980s as a member of the central executive committee of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)).&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/25april2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement from Dar recorded by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) when he was detained following the 1999 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état, he began a close association with the Sharif family in 1990, in the course of which he laundered &quot;$14.68 million and opened two bank accounts under the names of Sikandar Masood Qazi and Talat Masood Qazi for Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s brother&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/2feb2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the then Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, appointed him Chairman of the Pakistan Board of Investment with a status of Minister of State.&lt;ref name=&quot;pakistantoday/21sept2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the then President of Pakistan, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, dismissed the Sharif ministry. He became President of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry that same year.

Dar first stood for the National Assembly in a bye-election after the 1993 Pakistani general election; Sharif had stood and won in two constituencies but had to resign from one. Dar won on a 62% voteshare (39,483 votes).&lt;ref name=&quot;thenews/10oct2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the President, Farooq Leghari, dismissed the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her government, and dissolved the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;brecorder/23july2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/4june2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/27june2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Sharif ministry ===
In the 1997 snap election,&lt;ref name=&quot;book/9781135355760&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dar successfully stood for election to Lahore&#x27;s NA-97 National Assembly constituency on a PML(N) ticket and won 61,556 votes. Sharif&#x27;s PML(N) again won a clear majority,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/5feb1997&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Dar was Federal Minister for Industries and Investment in from February to July 1997.

In December 1997, he was appointed Federal Minister for Commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;2ndcabinet/nawaz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenews/13dec2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, India and then Pakistan tested nuclear weapons; Pakistan was subsequently economically sanctioned, with severe economic consequences. Dar was then appointed Minister for Finance, and negotiated an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package.

=== Military rule ===
In 1999, General Pervez Musharraf overthrew the Sharif ministry in a military coup d&#x27;état. Dar spent nearly two years in jail on corruption charges that never went to trial. Dar withstood pressure to politically abandon the PML(N) and Sharif,&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/30may2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but during his detention in 2000, Dar accused Nawaz Sharif of having engaged in money laundering in the late 1990s&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/13nov2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and, in connection with the Hudabya Papers Mills case, Dar confessed to laundering US$14.86 million on behalf of the Nawaz Sharif.&lt;ref name=&quot;herald/12dec2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He later said these statements were made under duress.&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/11nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On his release, Musharraf remained in power, and Dar moved to the United Arab Emirates, where he worked as a financial adviser. His clients included a member of the ruling family. In 2002, he was made President of PML(N)&#x27;s International Affairs wing.

After several months outside Pakistan, Dar returned to Pakistan in 2003 to run for a seat in the Senate as a candidate of PML(N) and was elected for the first time, for a term of three years. During his tenure as Member of the Senate, he served as Parliamentary Leader of the PML(N) in the Senate. He was re-elected to the Senate in the 2006 senate election as a candidate of PML(N), this time for a term of six years. During his tenure as Member of the Senate between 2003 and 2012, he remained the Parliamentary Leader of the PML(N) in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/8march2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gillani coalition ministry ===
After the formation of a coalition government between the PPP and PML(N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, following the 2008 general election, which had resulted in a hung parliament where the PPP had secured the largest number of seats in the National Assembly and the PML(N) the second largest, Dar due to his expertise in finance and economics, was invited to join the cabinet of Yousaf Raza Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance with the additional cabinet portfolio of revenue, economic affairs and statistics.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/14may2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, his tenure as Minister for Finance was short-lived after the PML(N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary after the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, as agreed between PML(N) and PPP in the Bhurban Accord. During his brief tenure as finance minister, he was criticized for causing the rupee fall, bank run and panic in the market. Meanwhile, he has been credited for proposing the idea of the Benazir Income Support Programme, a Pakistani government aid program to provide financial assistance to low-income families which is said to be one of the largest in South Asia. Dar claimed that the original name of the organisation proposed was Pakistan Income Support Programme but that it was renamed by PPP for political gains after he stepped down form the ministerial office.

In 2011 Dar was decorated with Nishan-e-Imtiaz, the highest civil award given to Pakistani nationals, for his parliamentary service in Pakistan. However, he refused to receive it from the then-President, Asif Ali Zardari. Dar was re-elected to the Senate for the third time in the 2012 senate election, for six years as a candidate of PML(N) on technocrat seat from Punjab after which he was appointed by Nawaz Sharif as the Parliamentary Leader of the PML(N) in the Senate. A few days later he was elected as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, replacing Abdul Ghafoor Haideri&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/14mar2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for his negotiation skills with PPP government on major issues. During his tenure as Member of the Senate, he remained member of the various Standing Committees of Senate such as defence and defence production, foreign affairs, Kashmir affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, commerce and finance, revenue, economic affairs, statistics, planning and development and privatisation. He also served as a member of the Special Committee on Constitutional Reforms, and co-prepared and passed the 18th, the 19th, and the 20th amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan.

===Third Sharif ministry===

Dar was a member of the PML(N)&#x27;s parliamentary board, charged with the selection of candidates for the 2013 general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn/26march2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The PML(N) won a majority, and Dar resigned as leader of the opposition in the Senate. He became Minister for Finance&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune/22nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;khaleejtimes/13may2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was given the additional cabinet portfolios of Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatisation. Dar held significant power. He chaired the Special Parliamentary Committee on Election Reforms and the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). With Maryam Nawaz, he deputed for the Prime Minister whilst he underwent surgery in the United Kingdom. &quot;Dawn&quot; reported that he headed over &quot;four dozen&quot; committees.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/27nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, the NAB cleared Dar of allegations of corruption involving over Rs 130 billion. &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; reported that a source in the NAB alleged &quot;immense pressure&quot; to clear Dar, even though there was sufficient evidence to convict him.

In October 2016, the Finance Ministry announced that the IMF conferred the &quot;Finance Minister of the Year for South Asia&quot; award to Dar. Dar was issued the award by an independent publication unaffiliated with the IMF but funded by five Pakistani state-owned firms.

In July 2017, the Supreme Court disqualified both Dar and Sharif from office, following the publication of the Panama Papers. Sharif&#x27;s successor, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, reappointed him as Finance Minister despite the ruling, but reduced his powers. Dar was replaced as Chair of the ECC and a committee on privatisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune/17aug2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The finance ministry was split. The &quot;Nation&quot; reported that Dar wished to leave the cabinet but that it was impossible to relieve him of all responsibility immediately due to the extent of his former responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/17aug2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasi also removed Dar from the chairmanship of 35 committees of the National Assembly, thus further reducing Dar&#x27;s influence. &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; quoted a source claiming that Sharif had ordered the reduction of Dar&#x27;s influence. In September 2017 a NAB court in Pakistan indicted Dar in the Panama Papers corruption case for having wealth beyond his known sources of income, but, despite criticism from the opposition parties, he continued to serve as finance minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/19nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017 he fell ill while in Saudi Arabia and left for the United Kingdom for medical treatment.

In November 2017 the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for him while he was in London for not appearing in court. It was reported that it was possible he would lose his ministerial portfolio due to the corruption case against him on the grounds that he has become ineffective and unable to carry out the responsibilities of a Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;pakistantoday/16nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 21November a court declared him an absconder. Amid the rumours that he had already resigned from the ministerial office due to pressure and criticism, he resigned on 22 November&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/23nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after taking medical leave. His cabinet portfolio of Finance Minister was withdrawn. However, he continued to remain a member of the federal cabinet&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune/24nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as a federal minister without portfolio. It was noted that Dar has refused to leave the Finance Ministry and that he took a temporary medical leave for three months after which he may retook the office upon his return to Pakistan.

Dar was credited with stabilising the economy after the 2013 balance of payments crisis locally and internationally,&lt;ref name=&quot;thenews/24nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but critics also alleged he had failed to implement structural reforms and manipulated statistics. in particularly steering country out of balance of payments crisis in 2013. Dar borrowed $35billion from foreign lenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/23nov2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, an accountability court declared Dar a proclaimed offender in a corruption case after he repeatedly failed to appear before the court, and the court subsequently deemed him a fugitive.

On 26 December, Abbasi promoted his special assistant on Economic Affairs Miftah Ismail to Adviser on Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs with the status of a federal minister,&lt;ref name=&quot;nation/27dec2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding Dar. Abbasi continued to hold office as minister of finance.

===In opposition===
In February 2018, the name of Dar was shortlisted by PML(N) amongst the candidate for March 2018 Senate election after which Dar filed his nomination papers for a general seat and a technocrat seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune/17feb2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected his nomination papers. On 17 February, Lahore High Court granted permission to Dar to participate in the Senate elections. On 22 February, the Election Commission of Pakistan declared all PML(N) candidates for the Senate election as independent after a ruling of the Supreme Court. On 3 March 2018, he was re-elected to the Senate as an independent candidate on technocrat seat from Punjab with the backing by PML(N). On 12 March 2018, he ceased to hold the position of a federal minister due to expiration of his Senate term.

In May 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the ECP to suspend the notification of Senator-elect Dar as member of the Senate for his failure to appear before the court. As of June 2018, he did not take oath of Senator. In June 2018, the ECP suspended the Senate membership of Dar. On 10 July, the Supreme Court ordered Dar to appear before court within three days. Interpol Red Notice for Dar was issued by the government of Pakistan on 14 July to bring him back to Pakistan.

In August 2018, the NAB approved an inquiry into a graft case against Dar for illegally awarding a Next Generation Mobile Services contract and for committing alleged financial irregularities. In September, his passport was cancelled by the government of Pakistan making him a stateless person. The same month, a British parliamentary team rejected an online petition seeking the deportation of Dar on the ground that there is no extradition treaty between the two countries.

=== First Shehbaz Sharif ministry ===

Dar was appointed minister of finance in September 2022 and served until August 2023. His tenure coincided with a challenging economic period, marked by high inflation and the need for International Monetary Fund assistance. In January 2023, Dar sought US assistance in obtaining IMF funding in view of recent floods and adverse economic conditions. 

Imran Khan&#x27;s administration had previously initiated negotiations with the IMF for a bailout program, but these talks stalled before his departure in April 2022.

During Dar&#x27;s tenure, Pakistan experienced high inflation peaking at 37.97% and significant interest rate hikes reaching 21%. These developments can be attributed, according to some critics, to the policy requirements of the IMF program.

Dar&#x27;s approach involved advocating for market intervention to stabilize the Pakistani rupee, a strategy that reportedly differed from the IMF&#x27;s recommendations. Additionally, he publicly criticized the IMF during negotiations, potentially impacting the process.

Pakistan faced a seven-month-long struggle to release the remaining tranches of its final $6.5 billion bailout program. Despite delays, Dar negotiated a deal with the IMF, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif playing a pivotal role in finalizing the agreement. 

In 2023, he was nominee of position of Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan before being ruled out in favour of Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar.

=== Second Shehbaz Sharif ministry ===
During the 2024 election campaign, Ishaq Dar&#x27;s policies were heavily criticized. He was blamed for mismanaging the government response to the ongoing economic crisis. This led to the speculation that he may be nominated as Chairman of the Senate. However, the power-sharing formula following the coalition agreement between PPP and PMLN resulted in senate chairmanship being allotted to PPP and National Assembly speakership being given to PMLN. Hence, he was sworn-in as a federal minister. He was appointed as the 38th Foreign Minister of Pakistan the following day. This emphasizes Shehbaz administration&#x27;s shifting focus towards a geoeconomic foreign policy. His senate term ended the day he took charge of the foreign ministry. In the 2024 Pakistani Senate election, he sought reelection. During the Senate elections on 2 April 2024, he secured victory for a technocrat seat representing Islamabad by receiving 222 votes. 

Dar expressed intentions to thoroughly assess the trade situation with India following concerns raised by the business community. Bilateral trade between the two countries has been on hold since August 2019, due to tensions sparked by India&#x27;s move to revoke Kashmir&#x27;s special status. 

Dar conveyed his concerns about terrorist hideouts in neighboring Afghanistan to the country&#x27;s Interim Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, following the North Waziristan terror attack on the Pakistan Army, resulting in the deaths of seven security force members. He expressed disappointment at the perceived lack of substantial action from Afghanistan in addressing terrorist groups operating from its territory.

On 28 April 2024, Dar was given the additional charge of Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan.

Dar described the killings in Gaza as a &quot;genocide&quot; of Palestinians and called for an &quot;immediate and unconditional&quot; ceasefire.

In October Ishaq Dar replaced Musadik Malik as Chairman of Sugar Monitoring Committee. &quot;Business Recorder&quot; commented that Dar was to take &quot;lenient&quot; decisions compared to &quot;harsh&quot; attitude. &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; noted that Malik had been &quot;ocal in his criticism of sugar millers for violating the export conditions imposed by the government. &quot; Dar was also placed as Chairman of the Iran-Pakistan gas line project.

==Daronomics==

Ishaq Dar served as finance minister of Pakistan across four terms, implementing economic policies known as Daronomics. These policies included maintaining a fixed dollar-rupee exchange rate, supported by foreign currency loans, keeping the State Bank of Pakistan&#x27;s policy rate low, and managing inflation through subsidies and cheap imports. While aimed at regulating the economy, these measures faced criticism for lacking long-term sustainability.

During his 1998–1999 term, Dar responded to a devaluation crisis by confiscating $11 billion from local dollar accounts, converting them at the official rate of Rs 46 per dollar. This led overseas Pakistanis to rely on informal remittance channels. His 2013–2017 tenure focused on stabilizing the exchange rate by injecting dollars into the market, which ultimately worsened the current account deficit and contributed to Pakistan&#x27;s 2019 IMF bailout.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
Dar belongs to a family of businessmen and traders of Kashmiri origin. He is regarded as the most trusted aide of the Sharif family. In 2004, Dar&#x27;s eldest son married Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s daughter Asma Nawaz in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

=== Philanthropy ===
Dar runs two charitable organisations as well. These trusts are aimed to provide shelter to the homeless children or orphans, provide student scholarships and organize mass wedding ceremonies for the less privileged.

=== Business ===
Dar&#x27;s declared assets stand at PKR. 583 million and investments at PKR. 325 million in Pakistan Investment Bonds. As of February 2022, all his personal assets, assets belonging to his family and those owned by his charitable organizations have been unfrozen under court orders.

<doc id="988765" wikidata="Q41898" url="?curid=988765" title="Sator Square">
<text>The Sator Square (or Rotas-Sator Square or Templar Magic Square) is a two-dimensional acrostic class of word square containing a five-word Latin palindrome. The earliest squares were found at Roman-era sites, all in ROTAS-form (where the top line is &quot;ROTAS&quot;, not &quot;SATOR&quot;), with the earliest discovery at Pompeii (and also likely pre-AD 62). The earliest square with Christian-associated imagery dates from the sixth century. By the Middle Ages, Sator squares had been found across Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa. In 2022, the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; called it &quot;the most familiar lettered square in the Western world&quot;.

A significant volume of academic research has been published on the square, but after more than a century, there is no consensus on its origin and meaning. The discovery of the &quot;Paternoster theory&quot; in 1926 led to a brief consensus among academics that the square was created by early Christians, but the subsequent discoveries at Pompeii led many academics to believe that the square was more likely created as a Roman word puzzle (as per the Roma-Amor puzzle), which was later adopted by Christians. This origin theory, however, fails to explain how a Roman word puzzle then became such a powerful religious and magical medieval symbol. It has instead been argued that the square was created in its ROTAS-form as a Jewish symbol, embedded with cryptic religious symbolism, which was later adopted in its SATOR-form by Christians. There are many other less-supported academic origin theories, such as a Pythagorean or Stoic puzzle, a Gnostic or Orphic or Italian pagan amulet, a cryptic Mithraic or Semitic numerology charm, or that it was simply a device for working out wind directions.

The square has long associations with magical powers throughout its history (and even up to the 19th century in North and South America), including a perceived ability to extinguish fires, particularly in Germany. The square appears in early and late medieval medical textbooks such as the Trotula, and was employed as a medieval cure for many ailments, particularly for dog bites and rabies, as well as for insanity, and relief during childbirth.

It has featured in a diverse range of contemporary artworks including fiction books, paintings, musical scores, and films, and most notably in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;Tenet&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;one of the closest things the classical world had to a meme&quot;.

==Description and naming==

The Sator square is arranged as a 5 × 5 grid consisting of five 5-letter words, thus totaling 25 characters. It uses 8 different Latin letters: 5 consonants (S, T, R, P, N) and 3 vowels (A, E, O). In some versions, the vertical and horizontal lines of the grid are also drawn, but in many cases, there are no such lines. The square is described as a two-dimensional palindrome, or word square, which is a particular class of a double acrostic.

The square comes in two forms: ROTAS (left, below), and SATOR (right, below):

The earliest Roman-era versions of the square have the word ROTAS as the top line (called a ROTAS-form square, left above), but the inverted version with SATOR in the top line became more dominant from early medieval times (called a SATOR-form square, right above). Some academics call it a Rotas-Sator Square, and some of them refer to the object as a rebus, or a magic square. Since medieval times, it has also been known as a Templar Magic Square.

==Discovery and dating==
The existence of the square was long recognized from early medieval times, and various examples have been found in Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa (in mainly Coptic settlements), and the Americas. Medieval examples of the square in SATOR-form abound, including the earliest French example in a Carolingian Bible from AD 822 at the monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Many medieval European churches and castles have Sator square inscriptions.

The first recognized serious academic study of the square was the 1881 publication of historical survey in &quot;&quot;, titled &quot;Sator-Arepo-Formel&quot;, and a considerable body of academic research has been subsequently published on the meaning of the square.

Up until the 1930s, a Coptic papyrus with the square in the ROTAS-form dating from the fourth or fifth century AD was considered the earliest version. In 1889, British ancient historian Francis Haverfield identified the 1868 discovery of a Sator square found in ROTAS-form scratched on a plaster wall in the Roman settlement of Corinium at Cirencester to be of Roman origin; however, his assertion was discounted at the time by most academics who considered the square to be an &quot;early medieval charm&quot;.

Haverfield was ultimately proved right by the 1931-32 excavations at Dura-Europos in Syria that uncovered three separate Sator square inscriptions, all in ROTAS-form, on the interior walls of a Roman military office (and a fourth a year later) that were dated from circa AD 200. 

Five years later in 1936, Italian archaeologist discovered a Sator square, also in ROTAS-form, inscribed on a column in the (the gymnasium) near the Amphitheatre of Pompeii (&quot;CIL IV 8623&quot;). This discovery led Della Corte to reexamine a fragment of a square, again also in ROTAS-form, that he had made in 1925 at the house of Publius Paquius Proculus, also at Pompeii (&quot;CIL IV 8123&quot;). The square at the house of Publius Paquius Proculus was dated between AD 50 and AD 79 (based on the decorative style of the interior), and the palestra square find was dated pre-AD 62 (and therefore the earthquake of AD 62), making it the oldest known Sator square discovery to date.

==Translation==

===Individual words===

The words are in Latin, and the following translations are known by scholars:

:;: (nominative noun; from , &quot;to sow&quot;) sower, planter, founder, progenitor (usually divine); originator; literally &#x27;seeder&#x27;;
:; : unknown word, perhaps a proper name, either invented to complete the palindrome or of a non-Latin origin (see § Arepo interpretations);
:; : (verb; from , &#x27;to hold&#x27;) he/she/it holds, keeps, comprehends, possesses, masters, preserves, sustains;
:; : (ablative [see ] singular noun) service, pains, labor; care, effort, attention;
:; : (, accusative plural of ) wheels. 

===Sentence construction===

The most direct sentence translation is: &quot;The sower (or, farmer) Arepo holds the wheels with care (or, with care the wheels)&quot;. Similar translations include: &quot;The farmer Arepo works his wheels&quot;, or &quot;Arepo the sower (sator) guides (tenet) the wheel (rotas) with skill (opera)&quot;.

Some academics, such as French historian Jules Quicherat, believe the square should be read in a boustrophedon style (i.e. in alternating directions). The boustrophedon style, which in Greek means &quot;as the ox plows&quot;, emphasizes the agricultural aspect of the text of the square. Such a reading when applied to the SATOR-form square, and repeating the central word TENET, gives SATOR OPERA TENET – TENET OPERA SATOR, which has been very loosely interpreted as: &quot;as ye sow, so shall ye reap&quot;, while some believe the square should be read as just three words – SATOR OPERA TENET, which they loosely translate as: &quot;The Creator (the author of all things) maintains his works&quot;; both of which could imply Graeco-Roman Stoic and/or Pythagorean origins.

British academic Duncan Fishwick observes that the translation from the boustrophedon approach fails when applied to a ROTAS-form square; however, Belgian scholar Paul Grosjean reversed the boustrophedon rule on the ROTAS-form (i.e. starting on the right-hand side instead of the left) to get SAT ORARE POTEN, which loosely translates into the Jewish call to prayer, &quot;are you able to pray enough?&quot;.

===Arepo interpretations===
The word AREPO is a hapax legomenon, appearing nowhere else in attested Latin literature. Some academics believe it is likely a proper name, or possibly a theophoric name, that was adapted from a non-Latin word or was invented specifically for the Sator square. French historian Jerome Carcopino believed that it came from the Gaulish word for a &#x27;plough&#x27;; however, this has been discounted by other academics. American ancient legal historian David Daube believed that AREPO represented a Hebrew or Aramaic rendition of the ancient Greek for alpha () and omega (), bespeaking the &quot;Alpha-Omega&quot; concept (cf. Isiah 44.6, and Revelation 1:8) from early Judeo-Christianity. J. Gwyn Griffiths contended that the term AREPO came, via Alexandria, from the attested Egyptian name &quot;Hr-Hp&quot; (&quot; &quot;), which he took to mean &quot;the face of Apis&quot;. In 1983, Serbian-American scholar Miroslav Marcovich proposed the term AREPO as a Latinized abbreviation of Harpocrates (or &quot;Horus-the-child&quot;), god of the rising sun, also called , which Marcovich suggests corresponds to SATOR AREPO. This would translate the square as: &quot;The sower Horus/Harpocrates keeps in check toils and tortures&quot;.

Duncan Fishwick, among other academics, believed that AREPO was simply a residual word that was required to complete what is a complex and sophisticated palindrome (which Fishwick believed was embedded with hidden Jewish symbolism, per the &quot;Jewish Symbol&quot; origin theory below), and to expect more from the word was unreasonable from its likely Jewish creators.

===Further anagrams===

Attempts have been made to discover &quot;hidden meanings&quot; by the anagrammatic method of rearranging the letters of which the square is composed.

* In 1883, German historian Gustav Fritsch reformed the letters to discover an invocation to Satan:
*:SATAN, ORO TE, PRO ARTE A TE SPERO
*:SATAN, TER ORO TE, OPERA PRAESTO
*:SATAN, TER ORO TE, REPARATO OPES
* French historian Guillaume de Jerphanion catalogued examples that were known formulas for an exorcism such as:
*:RETRO SATANA, TOTO OPERE ASPER, and the prayers
*:ORO TE PATER, ORO TE PATER, SANAS
*:O PATER, ORES PRO AETATE NOSTRA
*:ORA, OPERARE, OSTENTA TE PASTOR
* In 1887, Polish ethnographer Oskar Kolberg amended the strict anagrammatic approach by using abbreviations and thus deduced from the 25 letters of the Sator Square the 36 letters of the monastic rule: SAT ORARE POTEN (TER) ET OPERA(RE) R(ATI)O T(U)A S(IT), which he considered an ancient rule of the Benedictines; French historian Gaston Letonnelier made a similar approach in 1952 to get the Christian prayer: SAT ORARE POTEN(TIA) ET OPER(A) A ROTA S(ERVANT), which translates as: &quot;Prayer is our strength and will save us from the wheel (of fate?)&quot;.
* In 1935, German art historian believed he discovered the relief the Rose of Sharon gave to Saint Peter for the sin of his denial of Christ, with the anagram PETRO ET REO PATET ROSA SARONA, which translates as &quot;For Peter even guilty the rose of Sharon is open&quot;; academics refuted his interpretation.
* In 2003, American historian Rose Mary Sheldon listed some of the many diverse sentences that can be produced from anagrams of the square including her favorite: APATOR NERO EST, which would translate as saying that the Roman emperor Nero was the result of a virgin birth.

==Origin and meaning==

The origin and meaning of the square has eluded a definitive academic consensus even after more than a century of study. In 1938, British classical historian Donald Atkinson said the square occupied the &quot;mysterious region where religion, superstition, and magic meet, where words, numbers, and letters are believed, if properly combined, to exert power over the processes of nature ...&quot;. Even by 2003, American academic Rose Mary Sheldon called it &quot;one of the oldest unsolved word puzzles in the world&quot;. In 2018, American ancient classical historian Megan O&#x27;Donald still noted that &quot;most interpretations of the ROTAS square have failed to gain consensus due to failings&quot;, and, in particular, reconciling the archeological evidence with the square&#x27;s later adoption as a religious and magical object.

===Christian symbol===

====Adoption by Christians====

Irrespective of the theory of its origin, the evidence that the Sator square, particularly in its SATOR-form, became adopted into Christian imagery is not disputed by academics. Academics note the repeated association of Christ with the &quot;sower&quot; (or SATOR), and the words of the Sator square have been discovered in Christian settings even in very early medieval times, including:

* Jesuit historian Jean Daniélou claimed that the third century Bishop Irenaeus of Lyons (c. AD 200) knew of the square and had written of &quot;Him who joined the beginning with the end, and is the Lord of both, and has shown forth the plough at the end&quot;. Some academics link Irenaeus with creating the association of the five words in the square to the five wounds of Christ.
* The Berlin State Museum houses a sixth-century bronze amulet from Asia Minor that has two fish turned toward one another on one side, and a Sator square in Greek characters in a checkerboard pattern on the other side. Written above the square is the word &quot;ICHTHUS&quot;, which directly translates as a term for Christ; it is the earliest known Christian annotated Sator Square.
* An illustration in an early Byzantine bible gives the baptismal names of the three Magi as being: ATOR, SATOR, and PERATORAS.
* In Cappadocia, in the time of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (913–959), the shepherds of the Nativity of Jesus are named: SATOR, AREPON, and TENETON.

The Sator square appears in diverse Christian communities, such as in Abyssinia where in the &quot; Ethiopian Book of the Dead&quot;, the individual nails in Christ&#x27;s cross were called: Sador, Alador, Danet, Adera, Rodas. These are likely derived from even earlier Coptic Christian works that also ascribe the wounds of Christ and the nails of the cross with names that resemble the five words from the square.

While there is little doubt among academics that Christians adopted the square, it was not clear that they had originated the symbol.

====Paternoster theory====
During 1924 to 1926, three people separately discovered, or rediscovered, that the square could be used to write the name of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the &quot;Paternoster&quot;, twice and intersecting in a cross-form (see image opposite). The remaining residual letters (two &quot;A&quot;s and two &quot;O&quot;s) could be placed in the four quadrants of the cross and would represent the Alpha and Omega that are established in Christian symbolism. The positioning of the &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;O&quot;s was further supported by the fact that the position of the &quot;T&quot;s in the Sator square formed the points of a cross – there are obscure references in the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot; to T being a symbol of the cross – and that the &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;O&quot;s also lay in the four quadrants of this cross. At the time of this discovery, the earliest known Sator square was from the fourth century, further supporting the dating of the Christian symbolism inherent in the Paternoster theory. Academics considered the Christian origins of the square to be largely resolved.

With the subsequent discovery of Sator squares at Pompeii, dating pre-79 AD, the Paternoster theory began to lose support, even among notable supporters such as French historian Guillaume de Jerphanion. Jerphanion noted: that (1) it was improbable that many Christians were present at Pompeii, that (2) first-century Christians would have written the square in Greek and not Latin, that (3) the Christian concepts of Alpha and Omega only appear after the first century, that (4) the symbol of the cross only appears from about AD 130–131, and that (5) cryptic Christian symbols only appeared during the persecutions of the third century.

Jérôme Carcopino claimed the Pompeii squares were added at a later date by looters. The lack of any disturbance to the volcanic deposits at the palestra, however, meant that this was unlikely, and the Paternoster theory as a proof of Christian origination lost much of its academic support.

Regardless of its Christian origins, many academics considered the Paternoster discovery as being a random occurrence to be mathematically impossible. Several examined this mathematical probability including German historian and British historian Hugh Last, but without reaching a conclusion. A 1987 computer analysis by William Baines derived a number of &quot;pseudo-Christian formulae&quot; from the square but Baines concluded it proved nothing.

===Roman word puzzle===

There is considerable contemporary academic support for the theory that the square originated as a Roman-era word puzzle. Italian historian Arsenio Frugoni found it written in the margin of the &quot;Carme delle scolte modenesi&quot; beside the Roma-Amor palindrome, and Italian classicist Margherita Guarducci noted it was similar to the ROMA OLIM MILO AMOR two-dimensional acrostic word puzzle that was also found at Pompeii (see for details on the Pompeiian graffito), and at Ostia and Bolonia. Similarly, another ROTAS-form square scratched into a Roman-era wall in the basement of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, was found alongside the Roma-Amor, and the Roma-Summus-Amor, palindromes. Duncan Fishwick noted the &quot;composition of palindromes was, in fact, a pastime of Roman landed gentry&quot;. American classical epigraphist Rebecca Benefiel, noted that by 2012, Pompeii had yielded more than 13,000 separate inscriptions and that the house of Publius Paquius Proculus (where a square was found) had more than 70 pieces of graffiti alone.

A 1969 computer study by Charles Douglas Gunn started with a Roma-Amor square and found 2,264 better versions, of which he considered the Sator square to be the best. The square&#x27;s origin as a word puzzle solved the problem of AREPO (a word that appears nowhere else in classical writing), as being a necessary component to complete the palindrome.

Fishwick still considered this interpretation as unproven and clarified that the apparent discovery of the Roma-Amor palindrome written beside the 1954 discovery of a square on a tile at Aquincum, was incorrectly translated (if anything it supported the square as a charm). Fishwick, and others, consider the key failing of the Roman puzzle theory of origin is the lack of any explanation as to why the square would later become so strongly associated with Christianity, and with being a medieval charm. Some argue that this can be bridged if considered as a Pythagorean-Stoic puzzle creation.
In 2018, Megan O&#x27;Donnell argued that the square is less of a pure word puzzle but more a piece of Latin Roman graffito that should be read &quot;figuratively&quot; as a wheel (i.e. the ROTAS), and that the textual-visual interplay had parallels with other forms of graffito found in Pompeii, some of which later became adopted as charms.

===Jewish symbol===
Some prominent academics, including British-Canadian ancient Roman scholar Duncan Fishwick, American ancient legal historian David Daube, and British ancient historian Mary Beard, consider the square as being likely of Jewish origin.

Fishwick notes that the failings of the Paternoster theory (above) are resolved when looked at from a Jewish perspective. Large numbers of Latin-speaking Jews had been settled in Pompeii, and their affinity for cryptic and mystical word symbols was well known. The Alpha and Omega concept appears much earlier in Judaism (Ex. 3.14; Is. 41.4, and 44.6), and the letters &quot;aleph&quot; and &quot;tau&quot; are used in the Talmud as symbols of totality. The &quot;T&quot;s of TENET may be explained not as Christian crosses, but as a Latin form of the Jewish &quot;tau&quot; salvation symbol (from Ezekiel), and its archaic form (+ or X) appears regularly on ossuaries of both Hellenistic and early Roman times. Fishwick highlights the central position of the letter &quot;N&quot;, as Jews attached significance to the utterance of the &quot;Name&quot; (or nomen).

In addition, Fishwick believes a Jewish origin provides a satisfactory explanation for the Paternoster cross (or X) as the configuration is an archaic Jewish &quot;tau&quot; (+ or X). Fishwick draws attention to some liturgical prayers in Judaism, where several prayers refer to &quot;Our Father&quot;. None of these liturgical prayers, however, can be dated to before Jesus. Fishwick concludes that the translations of the words ROTAS OPERA TENET AREPO SATOR are irrelevant, except to the extent that they make some sense and thereby hide a Jewish cryptic charm, and to require them to mean more is &quot;to expect the impossible&quot;. The motivation for the creation square might have been the Jewish pogroms of AD 19 or AD 49; however, it fell into disuse only to be revived later by Christians facing their own persecution, and who appreciated its hidden Paternoster and Alpha and Omega symbolism, but who focused on the SATOR-form (which gave an emphasis on the &quot;sower&quot;, which was associated with Christ).

Research in 2006 by French classical scholar Nicolas Vinel drew on recent discoveries on the mathematics of ancient magic squares to propose that the square was a &quot;Jewish cryptogram using Pythagorean arithmetic&quot;. Vinel decoded several Jewish concepts in the square, including the reason for AREPO, and was able to explain the word SAUTRAN that appears beside the square that was discovered on the palestra column in Pompeii. Vinel addressed a criticism of the Jewish origin theory – why would the Jews have then abandoned the symbol? – by noting the Greek texts that they also abandoned (e.g. the Septuagint) in favor of Hebrew versions.

===Other theories===

The amount of academic research published on the Rotas-Sator square is regarded as being considerable (and even described by one source as &quot;immense&quot;); American academic Rose Mary Sheldon attempted to catalog and review the most prominent works in a 2003 paper published in &quot;Cryptologia&quot;. Among the more diverse but less supported theories Sheldon recorded were:

* Several German academics have written on the links of the square to Pythagoreanism and Stoicism, including philologist , historian , and Heinz Hoffman, among others. Schneider believed the square was an important link between Etruscan religion and Stoic academic philosophy. Hommel believed that in the Stoic tradition, the Ephesian word AREPO would be discarded, and the square would be read in the boustrophedon style as SATOR OPERA TENET, TENET OPERA SATOR, translating as &quot;The Creator preserves his works&quot;. German scholar writing the Sator square&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Christianity&quot; found this theory persuasive, but Miroslav Marcovich refuted the translation.
* Several academics link the square to Gnostic origins, such as Jean Doignon, Gustav Maresch, Adolfo Omodeo, and . English egyptogolist J. Gwyn Griffiths explains AREPO as a personal name derived from the Egyptian name &quot;Hr-Hp&quot;, and sources the square to an Alexandrine origin where a gnostic tradition employed acrostics.
* Some academics link the square to Orphic cults, including Serbian historian Milan Budimir who linked the Greek form of AREPO to the name Orpheus.
* Italian academic Adolfo Omodeo linked the square to Mithraic origins as the Roman-era discoveries were in military locations with whom it was popular, while academic historian Walter O. Moeller attempted to derive a Mithraic relationship using perceived mathematical patterns in the square, but his arguments were not considered convincing by other academics.
* Norwegian philologist Samson Eitrem took the last half of the square starting at &quot;N&quot; to get: &quot;net opera rotans&quot;, which translates as &quot;She spins her works&quot;, interpreting it to be a feminine being (i.e. Hecate), a demon, or even the square itself rotating on its TENET spokes, thus giving a peasant Italian pagan origin with the square as a wind indicator.
* Some academics such as Swiss archeologist have proposed that it is a numerical number square, which would also imply a Semitic origin. A significant issue is that the square is in Latin, and Romans did not have the ciphered number system of the Greeks or the Semites. However, if the letters are transliterated to Greek, and then assigned ciphered numbers, the word TENET can be rendered as 666, the number of the beast. Walter O. Moeller analyzed the resultant numerical combinations to assert that the square was made by Mithraic numerologists.
* In 1925, Zatzman interpreted the square as a Hebraic or Aramaic apotropaic formula against the devil, and translated the square to read: &quot;Satan Adama Tabat Amada Natas&quot;.
* In 1958, French historian Paul-Louis Couchoud proposed a novel interpretation as the square being a device for working out wind directions.

==Magical and medical associations==
In 2003, Rose Mary Sheldon noted: &quot;Long after the fall of Rome, and long after the general public had forgotten about classical word games, the square survived among people who might not even read Latin. They continued to use it as a charm against illness, evil and bad luck. By the end of the Middle Ages, the &quot;prophylactic magic&quot; of the square was firmly established in the superstition of Italy, Serbia, Germany, and Iceland, and eventually even crossed to North America&quot;. The square appears in versions of several popular magical manuscripts from the early and late Middle Ages magical text such as the &quot;Tabula Smaragdina&quot; and the &quot;Clavicula Salomonis&quot;.

In Germany in the Middle Ages, the square was inscribed on disks that were then thrown into fires to extinguish them. An edict in 1743 by Duke Ernest Auguste of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach required all settlements to make Sator square disks to combat fires. By the fifteenth century the square was being used as a touchstone against fire at the Château de Chinon and in France. 

The square appears as a remedy during labour in the twelfth-century Latin medical text, the Trotula, and was widely cited as a cure for dog bites and rabies in medieval Europe; in both cases, the remedy/cure is administered by eating bread inscribed with the words of the square. By the sixteenth century, the use of the square to cure insanity and fever was being documented in books such as &quot;De Varia Quercus Historia&quot; (1555) by Jean du Choul, and &quot;De Rerum Varietate&quot; (1557) by Gerolamo Cardano. Jean du Choul describes a case where a person from Lyon recovered from insanity after eating three crusts of bread inscribed with the square. After the meal, the person then recited five paternosters for the five wounds of Christ, linking to the Christian imagery believed encoded into the square.

Scholars have found medieval Sator-based charms, remedies, and cures, for a diverse range of applications from childbirth, to toothaches, to love potions, to ways of warding off evil spells, and even to determine whether someone was a witch. Richard Cavendish notes a medieval manuscript in the Bodleian says: &quot;Write these [five sator] words on in parchment with the blood of a Culver [pigeon] and bear it in thy left hand and ask what thou wilt and thou shalt have it. fiat.&quot; Other examples include Bosnia, where the square was used as a remedy for aquaphobia, and in Iceland, it was etched into the fingernails to cure jaundice.

There are examples from the nineteenth century in South America, where the Sator square was used as a cure for dog bites and snake-bites in Brazil, and in enclaves of German settlers (or mountain whites) in the Allegheny Mountains who used the square to prevent fire, stop fits, and prevent miscarriages. The Sator square features in eighteenth-century books on Pow-wow folk medicine of the Pennsylvania Dutch, such as &quot;The Long Lost Friend&quot; (see image).

==Notable examples==

===Roman===

* The oldest Sator square was found in November 1936, in ROTAS-form, etched into column number LXI at the near the amphitheatre of Pompeii (&quot;CIL IV 8623&quot;). Graffiti associated with the particular columns pre-dates the AD 62 Pompeii earthquake, making it the oldest known square. It also has additional graffiti just below it, with the words SAUTRAN and VALE (&quot;CIL IV 8622a-b&quot;).
* Another Sator square was also found in October 1925, in ROTAS-form, etched onto the wall in a bathroom of the house of Publius Paquius Proculus (Reg I, Ins 7, 1), also at Pompeii (&quot;CIL IV 8123&quot;). The style of the house, which is associated with Nero&#x27;s reign, dated the square to between AD 50 and AD 79 (the destruction of the city).
* A Sator square was found in 1954, in ROTAS-form, etched onto a roof tile of the second-century Roman Imperial governor&#x27;s house for Pannonia Inferior at Aquincum, near Budapest, Hungary. There has been debate over whether a second partial inscription found beside the square is part of the Roma-Amor palindrome (thus affirming the Roman puzzle origin theory), but it seems unlikely.

* A Sator square was found in 1978, in ROTAS-form, etched on a fragment of Roman pottery at a Roman site at Manchester that was dated circa. AD 185.
* Four Sator squares were found in 1931–32, all in ROTAS-form, etched on the walls of military buildings, at Dura-Europos in Syria, dated circa AD 200.
* A Sator square was found in 1868, in ROTAS-form, scratched onto a plaster wall in the Roman Britain settlement of Corinium Dobunnorum at Cirencester.
* A Sator square was found in 1971, in ROTAS-form, etched onto an unfired brick at the Roman city of Conímbriga in Portugal that was dated from the second century.
* A Sator square was found in 1966–71, in ROTAS-form, scratched into a Roman-era wall during excavations of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome (along with the Roma-Amor, and the Rome Summus Amor palindromes).

===Early medieval===

* The earliest Sator square post-Roman times was the 1899 discovery of a ROTAS-form square inscribed on a Coptic papyrus by German historians Adolph Erman and Fritz Krebs in the Egyptian papyrus collections of the Berlin State Museums (then the Koniglischen Museen); it has no other explicit Christian imagery.
* The earliest Sator square with explicit additional Christian imagery is a sixth-century bronze amulet from Asia Minor that has two fish turned toward one another on one side, and a Sator square in Greek characters in a checkerboard pattern on the other side. Written above the square is the word &quot;ICHTHUS&quot;, which directly translates as a term for Christ. It is also in the Berlin State Museums.
* One of the earliest examples of a Sator square in a Christian church is the SATOR-form marble square on the facade of the circa AD 752 Benedictine Abbey of St Peter ad Oratorium, near Capestrano, in Italy.
* The earliest example from France is a SATOR-form square found in a Carolingian Bible from AD 822 at the monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. There are ninth- to tenth-century examples in Codex 384 from Monte Cassino, and a square was found written into the margin of a work titled &quot;Versus de cavenda Venere et vino found&quot;, which is part of Codex 1.4 of the Capitolare di Modena.
* One of the earliest examples of the square being applied to medical beliefs is from the twelfth-century Latin medical textbooks, the Trotula, where the translated text advises: &quot;[98] Or let these names be written on cheese and butter: + sa. e. op. ab. z. po. c. zy. e pe. pa. pu c. ac. sator arepo tenet os pera rotas and let them be given to eat&quot;. In a similar vein, there is a thirteenth-century parchment from Aurillac that offers a Sator square chant for women in childbirth.

===Later medieval===
* Twelfth-century French examples are found on the wall of the Eglise Saint Laurent at , and in the keep of Château de Loches.
* A Sator square in SATOR-form was found on a block set into the doorway facade of a fortified wall in the largely abandoned medieval fortress town of Oppède-le-Vieux, in France&#x27;s Luberon; the old town itself dates from the twelfth or thirteenth-century and was abandoned by the seventeenth-century.
* Many medieval Italian towns and churches have squares. The twelfth-century church of San Giovanni Decolatto in Pieve Terzagni in Cremona has fragments of a floor mosaic that included a square. Valvisciolo Abbey has letters forming five concentric rings, each one divided into five sectors. One appears on the exterior wall of the Duomo in Siena. Inside the church of Acquaviva Collecroce is a stone with the square in a ROTAS-form. Others include the church of the Pieve of San Giovanni, the Collegiate church of Saint Ursus, the Cathedral of Ascoli Satriano, and the Church of San Lorenzo in Paggese in Marche.
* The square is also found in diverse locations all over later medieval France, including fifteenth-century examples at the Château de Chinon, the , as well as in the courthouse in Valbonnais.
* There is a Sator square in SATOR-form in the medieval Rivington Church in Lancashire, England.
* The phrase appears on the rune stone Nä Fv1979;234 from Närke, Sweden, dated to the fourteenth century. It reads &quot;sator arepo tenet&quot; (untranscribed: &quot;sator ¶ ar(æ)po ¶ tænæt). It also occurs in two inscriptions from Gotland (G 145 M and G 149 M), which contain the whole palindrome.

===Other===

* Lady Jane Francesa Wilde&#x27;s anthology of Irish folklore, &quot;Ancient Legends Mystic Charms &amp; Superstitions of Ireland&quot; (1888), includes the tale of a young girl who is enchanted by a poet using the spell of a Sator square written on a piece of paper in blood.
* The Sator square, with some letters changed, features in eighteenth-century books on Pow-wow folk medicine of the Pennsylvania Dutch, such as &quot;The Long Lost Friend&quot; (see image earlier).

==In popular culture==

The Sator square has inspired many works in the arts, including some classical and contemporary composers such as works by Austrian composer Anton Webern and Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi, writers such as Brazilian writer Osman Lins (whose novel &quot;Avalovara&quot; (1973) follows the structure of the square), and painters such as American artist Dick Higgins with &quot;La Melancolia&quot; (1983), and American artist Gary Stephan with &quot;Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas&quot; (1982).

British-American director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;Tenet&quot; has a story structure that mimics the square&#x27;s concept of interlinked multiple directions of meaning, and incorporates all five of the names from the Sator square:
*The main antagonist is named Sator.
*The artist who created the forged Goya drawings was named &quot;Arepo&quot;.
*&quot;Tenet&quot; is the title of the film as well as the secret organization that works to save the world.
*The opening scene is set at an opera house.
* Sator owns a construction company called &quot;Rotas&quot;.

American author Lawrence Watt-Evans notes that Sir Terry Pratchett named the main square in the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork in his &quot;Discworld&quot; book series, &quot;Sator Square&quot;, in a deliberate reference to the symbol. Watt-Evans notes that the Discworld series is full of other incidental references to unusual symbols and concepts.

The song &quot;Tenet&quot; by the Nordic neo-folk band Heilung is based on the Sator square. All its individual musical parts, melodies and instruments (and even at times the lyrics) play the same both forward and backwards.

<text>Panzerjäger (German: literally &quot;armor hunter&quot;, more broadly &quot;anti-tank&quot;) is a term used for an anti-tank vehicle (self-propelled anti-tank gun), as well as anti-tank units. The term was first used in the Wehrmacht (German armed forces, 1935–45), and also post-war by the German Federal Republic Bundeswehr. The term &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; was used in the Bundeswehr as a designation of rank.

== Wehrmacht ==

=== Development ===
From 1940, the troops were equipped with vehicles produced by mounting an existing anti-tank gun complete with the gun shield on a tracked chassis to allow higher mobility.

The development of &quot;Panzerjägers&quot; into the fully protected armored vehicle designs began before the war with the -designated armored artillery vehicles, the initial German turretless tanks to use completely closed-in armored casemates, and continued until 1944, resulting in the fully enclosed &quot;hunting tanks&quot;, purpose-built heavy-gun tank destroyers. These usually used upward extensions of both the glacis plate and hull sides to comprise three sides of their closed-in casemates. continued to serve as a separate branch of the &quot;Heer&quot; until the end of the war, often replacing tanks due to production shortages.

Initially, the chassis of captured light tanks were used after turrets were removed, providing a cost-effective solution to the German shortage of mobile anti-tank weapons in infantry divisions. Despite the shortcomings of light armour and high silhouette, they were successfully used in their intended role of a self-propelled anti-tank gun. Neither anti-tank guns nor &quot;Panzerjägers&quot; had any real armor to speak of, and while the had a higher silhouette and was more visible than an anti-tank gun, it was also much more mobile, and was able to relocate or retreat far more rapidly than conventional anti-tank gun crews. The lack of armor meant little until the self-propelled guns began to take on more and more of the offensive duties of tanks as the war progressed and production lagged.

=== Organisation ===
From 1943, the Type 44 infantry divisions included the following divisional &quot;Panzerjäger-Abteilung&quot; (&#x27;tank hunter battalion&#x27;):

* Staff company (&quot;Stabskompanie&quot;)
* 1. &quot;Panzerjäger-Kompanie&quot; equipped with 9-12 towed Anti-tank guns
* 2. &quot;Sturmgeschütz-Batterie&quot; equipped with ten fully-casemated StuG III, StuG IV assault guns or Hetzer vehicles
* 3. Light anti-aircraft company (&quot;leichte FlaK-Kompanie&quot;) equipped with 12 towed 20 mm FlaK autocannon

=== Combat use ===
 units were either assigned as the 14th companies in infantry regiments, or as a whole &quot;Abteilung&quot; (battalion) within Panzer and divisions, in both the Waffen-SS and the Heer, the (regular army). Independent battalions and regiments were used by corps to protect the most likely avenues of tank attacks, while divisions would often position their on the flanks, or use them to support infantry advances against an enemy using tanks. When used with tanks, despite intense inter-branch rivalry, would work in teams, with the tank crews enticing enemy tanks to fire, disclosing their position, and engaging the enemy from a defilade. were often called upon to provide direct high explosive supporting fire to infantry by destroying machine gun and artillery positions, particularly in urban fighting.

=== Vehicle designs ===
Designs of the vehicles varied based on the chassis used, which could be of three types:
* Early war open-topped superstructure on a light tank chassis
* Mid-war fully enclosed crew compartment on a medium or heavy tank chassis, as an added-on entity not usually integral to the original hull armor 
* Late war unarmoured or shielded mounting on a half-track chassis

 designs that entered service included:
*&quot;Panzerjäger I&quot; – Czech 4,7cm KPÚV vz. 38 (47 mm PaK) on Panzer I chassis.
*&quot;4,7 cm Pak (t) auf Panzerjäger Renault R35(f)&quot; - 47 mm Pak on Renault R35
*&quot;Marder I&quot; – 75 mm PaK 40 on captured French chassis, the Lorraine 37L.
*&quot;Marder II&quot; – 75 mm PaK 40 or 7.62 cm Pak 36(r) (a reused Soviet 76.2 mm gun) on Panzer II light tank chassis.
*&quot;Marder III&quot; – 75 mm PaK 40 or 7.62 cm Pak 36(r) on Czech-built Panzer 38(t) chassis.
*&quot;10.5 cm K gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette&quot; &quot;Dicker Max&quot; – two prototype as self-propelled bunker buster on Panzer IV chassis tested as anti-tank weapon.
*Sturer Emil – 12.8 cm &quot;Selbstfahrlafette auf&quot; VK 30.01(H), reuse of two prototype heavy tank chassis as experimental self-propelled gun.
*&quot;Hornisse&quot;, later renamed &quot;Nashorn&quot; – 88 mm PaK 43 on composite Panzer III/Panzer IV chassis.
*&quot;&quot;Ferdinand&quot;, later renamed &quot;Elefant&quot; –&quot; the last vehicle so designated, incorporating a fully enclosed, casemate added to VK 45.01 (P) hulls from the rejected Tiger I chassis design.

The later designation was used from the beginning for the following more integrally armored vehicles:
*&quot;Jagdpanzer 38(t)&quot; (also known as &#x27;Hetzer&#x27;)
*&quot;Jagdpanther&quot;
*&quot;Jagdpanzer IV&quot;
*&quot;Jagdtiger&quot;

== Bundeswehr ==
In the Bundeswehr of West Germany and subsequently the reunified Federal Republic, the &quot;Panzerjägers&quot; were reintroduced as a separate arm of the German Army. The &quot;Panzerjägertruppe&quot; existed from 1956 until 2006 when it was incorporated into the Panzer branch of the army. Among its notable systems of armament were the Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Kanonenjagdpanzer, Raketenjagdpanzer 1, Raketenjagdpanzer 2 and the &quot;Kampfpanzer M48A2GA2&quot; (a 105 mm gun armed variant of the M48 Patton tank. Soldiers in the lowest rank in the &quot;Panzerjägertruppe&quot; carried the term &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; as a title of their rank.

<text>Bitmap textures are digital images that represent surfaces, materials, patterns, or pictures. They are commonly used to give texture to models, renders, or environments in animation or video games. These textures are created by artists or designers using bitmap editor software such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, or simply by scanning an image and, if necessary, retouching it on a personal computer.

Bitmap images are typically made up of pixels, and each individual pixel represents a single point of color. By adjusting their size, frequency and color, graphic designers can create the illusion of depth and texture. 

Bitmap textures can be built as an image larger than the final destination, so as to fill the complete area without repeating the image, avoiding visible seams. Bitmap textures can also be created to be used as repetitive patterns to fill an infinite area.

When designed for print, textures are generally high-resolution in order to achieve good results in the final print. If the texture is meant to be used in multimedia, 3D animation or web design, they are created in a maximum resolution equal to that of the final display.

Vector graphics are an alternative to bitmap images and are made of geometric shapes, lines and curves which rely on mathematical formulas to maintain their shape.

<text>Lawrence Muggerud (born January 28, 1968) professionally known as DJ Muggs, is an American DJ, audio engineer and record producer. He has been a member of Cypress Hill, a member of the trip hop band Cross My Heart Hope to Die and the leader of hip hop and art collective Soul Assassins.

During his career, he has produced tracks for House of Pain, Funkdoobiest, Daddy Freddy, Pavlos Fyssas, Die Antwoord, Westside Gunn, remixed songs for Janet Jackson, U2, Kaliphz, Simply Red, Depeche Mode, and collaborated with Tricky, GZA, Sick Jacken, Planet Asia, Ill Bill, Meyhem Lauren and Roc Marciano. As part of Cypress Hill, he received three Grammy nominations for &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Out Like That&quot; and &quot;Throw Your Set in the Air&quot;.

He composed the film score of the 2023 feature film &quot;Divinity&quot;, along with musician and composer Dean Hurley.

==Life and career==
Of Italian descent, Muggerud was born in Queens borough of New York City, and was adopted into a Norwegian family. He moved to Bell Gardens, California at age fourteen, and got his start DJing for hip hop group The 7A3, who put out one album in 1988 before disbanding.

===Cypress Hill (1988–2004)===
After linking up with B-Real and Sen Dog to form the group Cypress Hill, he went on to produce seven studio albums with the group from 1991 to 2004. Of the seven, four reached platinum status, and three gold. Meanwhile, he scored hits on the side with Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;Check Yo Self&quot; and House of Pain&#x27;s &quot;Jump Around&quot;. During Cypress Hill&#x27;s early years, Muggerud met The Alchemist and his Dilated Peoples brethren on tour, deciding to take the young producer under his wing, providing a jump-start for his career.

===Soul Assassins===
In 1997, Muggerud released an album under the name Soul Assassins. The album, &quot;Soul Assassins I&quot;, reached #86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and earned critical praise. Produced by Muggerud, it featured Dr. Dre, B-Real, La the Darkman, Infamous Mobb, Mobb Deep, RZA, GZA, Goodie Mob, KRS-One and Wyclef Jean. In 2000 he returned to the Soul Assassins with &quot;Soul Assassins II&quot;, which reached only #178 on the charts but garnered similarly positive reviews. He also put out the record &quot;Dust&quot;, an atmosphere-heavy trip hop affair with Greg Dulli, Amy Trujillo and Everlast on vocals. After the 2004 album &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;, which reached #23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Cypress Hill went on a hiatus from recording, enabling its members to focus more on their side projects.

===Further solo projects and return of Cypress Hill (2005–2010)===
In 2005, Muggerud teamed up with Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s GZA for the album &quot;Grandmasters&quot;, the first project released on his label Angeles Records. Patterned after a chess game, it received positive reviews; Muggerud also announced a &quot;Soul Assassins III&quot; album, produced jointly by himself and Alchemist, reportedly to be preceded by a record called &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot;, also featuring Alchemist. Instead, Muggerud produced an album for Psycho Realm member Sick Jacken, &quot;Legend of the Mask and the Assassin&quot; two years later, in 2007. In 2008, Muggerud announced that his album with California rapper Planet Asia would be the third Soul Assassins album, but the two released &quot;Pain Language&quot; later that year as a simple collaboration.

Before the release of his solo album &quot;Smoke n Mirrors&quot; in 2009, B-Real reported that Cypress Hill has been working on an album for roughly a year. Currently in the mixing phase, Muggerud has produced half of the album&#x27;s material so far, going to DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Mike Shinoda for the rest. In 2009, Muggerud entered the Gumball 3000 cross-country race, and on June 23, 2009, &quot;Soul Assassins: Intermission&quot; was released, featuring RZA, Prodigy, Evidence, The Alchemist and Bun B. The first single for the album was &quot;Gangsta Shit&quot; by Bun B and M1. Despite its high-profile guest list, the release was met with lukewarm reception, and Muggerud later clarified its status as a preview before the release of &quot;Soul Assassins III&quot;, the next full-fledged installment of his Soul Assassins series. Muggerud plans next on recording his 5th V.S. album with group member B-Real. and in 2013 he confirmed a VS album with Meyhem Lauren as well.

On the Soul Assassins official website, it was also revealed that Muggerud contributed production to Apathy&#x27;s song &quot;Fear Itself&quot; from rapper&#x27;s &quot;Honkey Kong&quot; album, which was released August 23, 2011.

In 2011, Muggerud announced the release of a new album entitled &quot;Bass for Your Face&quot;, which he described as a &#x27;West Coast dubstep album&#x27;. In October 2011, Muggerud confirmed via his Twitter account that Public Enemy frontman Chuck D would contribute to the album, and the lead single would feature UK artist Dizzee Rascal and Los Angeles upstart MC Bambu.

=== Cross My Heart Hope to Die ===
Muggerud returned to the trip hop genre by teaming up with vocalist Brevi, fellow producer Andrew Kline (from the hardcore punk band Strife) and Sean Bonner, who served as a curator, hacker and creative technologist of the project. CMHHTD released their debut four-track self-titled extended play on April 2, 2013, and it was promoted by three music videos &quot;Wild Side&quot;, &quot;Miracles&quot; and &quot;Roller Coasting&quot;. On July 29, 2014, the band released their second extended play, &quot;Vita E Morte&quot;, it was supported by two music videos &quot;Two Shots&quot; and &quot;Tears Of God&quot;. Both EPs were released via Alpha Pup Records and also were released later as &quot;Cross My Heart Hope To Die&quot; eight-track album.

<text>The Marvel Comics anthology series &quot;What If?&quot; tells alternate reality stories outside the mainstream Marvel Universe continuity, which the company sets on what it calls Earth-616. A number of these stories have been set on alternate Earths in the Marvel Comics Multiverse (i.e., multiple universes) for which Marvel has given official numerical designations.

==Volume 1 (1977–1984)==
# What if Spider-Man had joined the Fantastic Four? (based on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1)
#* Reprinted in &quot;The Best of What If?&quot; Followed by &quot;What If?&quot; #21. Alternate sequels appeared in &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2, #35, and &quot;Paradise X&quot;. This world was designated Earth-772 in &quot;Marvel Encyclopedia: Fantastic Four&quot;.
#*Spider-Man did eventually join the team as a member of the &quot;New Fantastic Four&quot; and, more recently, as a member of the Future Foundation.
# What if the Hulk had the brain of Bruce Banner? (based on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #1)
#* This world was designated Earth-774 in &quot;Marvel Encyclopedia: Fantastic Four&quot;.
# What if the Avengers had never been? (based on &quot;The Avengers&quot; #3)
# What if the Invaders stayed together after World War II? (considered part of Earth-616, the mainstream Marvel continuity)
# What if Captain America had not vanished during World War II? (based on &quot;Avengers&quot; #4)
# What if the Fantastic Four had different super-powers? (based on &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1)
#* This version of the team reappeared in &quot;What If?&quot; (vol. 2) #39. This world was designated Earth-7712 in &quot;Marvel Encyclopedia: Fantastic Four&quot;.
# What if someone else besides Spider-Man had been bitten by the radioactive spider? (based on &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15)
#* Three different stories look at what would have happened if either Peter&#x27;s class bully Flash Thompson, his would-have-been temporary girlfriend Betty Brant, or publisher J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s astronaut son John, had been bitten by the radioactive spider instead. With the exception of Betty Brant (who quits her moniker like Peter did in &quot;Spider-Man No More&quot;), the protagonist dies in each story. A darker version of the Flash story is redone as &quot;What If?&quot; (vol. 2) #76.
# What if the world knew Daredevil was blind? (based on &quot;Daredevil&quot; #2)
#* This issue also contained the first humor-based &quot;What If?&quot; in the series asking, &quot;What if the spider had been bitten by a radioactive human?&quot;.
# What if the Avengers fought evil in the 1950s?
#* Designated Earth-9904 in &quot;All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: A-Z Update&quot; #2 (2007). A version of this timeline was revisited in &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, and yet another version made a cameo in &quot;Paradise X&quot;.
#*The Agents of Atlas, a superhero team from the 1950s, was based on this concept.
# What if Jane Foster had found the hammer of Thor? (based on &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #83)
#* Jane Foster would eventually become the new Thor in &quot;Thor&quot; (vol. 4) #1.
# What if the original Marvel Bullpen had become the Fantastic Four? (based on &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1)
#* This world made a brief tongue-in-cheek appearance in &quot;Paradise X&quot;. It was designated Earth-1228 in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005&quot;.
# What if Rick Jones had become the Hulk? (based on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #1)
# What if Conan the Barbarian walked the Earth today? (based on &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; #7 &quot;The Citadel at the Center of Time&quot;)
#* An alternate ending to this story can be seen in &quot;What If?&quot; #43.
# What if Nick Fury had fought World War II in outer space?
#* This universe made a brief appearance in &quot;Paradise X&quot;.
# What if Nova had been four other people? (based on &quot;Nova&quot; #1)
#* Instead of the random decision for Richard Rider to become Nova, the powers of Nova are transferred to a vengeful wife whose husband had been murdered, a kind and homeless black man in a universe with no superheroes, Peter Parker in a world where the radioactive spider that bit him had crippled him, and an unknown character with a villainous personality.
# What if Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, fought on the side of Fu Manchu? (based on &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; #15)

This particular issue features an alternate backstory for Bishop, where he and Trevor Fitzroy travel back in time to before the X-Men were formed.

==Marvel Alterniverse==

The Alterniverse was what Marvel briefly labeled their &quot;What If&quot; stories from 1995 to 1996. The stories told under the Alterniverse label are typically one-shots and limited series, such as &quot;Ruins&quot;, &quot;Punisher: A Man Named Frank&quot;, &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;, and &quot;The Last Avengers Story&quot;.

==Volume 3 (2005)==
A series of &quot;What If&quot; one-shot issues was released cover-dated February 2005.

*What if Karen Page had lived?
*What if Doctor Doom had become the Thing?
*What if Thunderbolt Ross had become the Hulk?
*What if Jessica Jones had joined the Avengers?
*What if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together?
*What if Aunt May had died instead of Uncle Ben?
*&quot;Wha—Huh?&quot; (humor issue) 

The series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If: Why Not&quot;.

==Volume 4 (early 2006)==
The February 2006 one-shot issues took place in a single fictional universe, dubbed Earth-717, with four of the six stories more like DC&#x27;s &quot;Elseworlds&quot; with various heroes in historical periods.

*What if Captain America had lived in the American Civil War?
*What if the Fantastic Four were Russian cosmonauts?
*What if the Sub-Mariner had grown up on land instead of Atlantis?
*What if Daredevil had lived in feudal Japan?
*What if Thor was a Herald of Galactus?
*What if Wolverine was Public Enemy Number One?

The series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If: Mirror Mirror&quot;.

==Volume 5 (late 2006)==
The November 2006 one-shot issues were based on major storylines or crossovers:

*&quot;What If: Avengers Disassembled&quot; - What if the Scarlet Witch had not acted alone?
*&quot;What If: Spider-Man: The Other&quot; - What if Peter Parker had rejected his inner spider?
*&quot;What If: Wolverine: Enemy of the State&quot; - What if Wolverine was never deprogrammed?
*&quot;What If: Age of Apocalypse&quot; - What if both Xavier and Magneto were killed by Legion?
*&quot;What If: X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot; - What if Vulcan became the leader of the X-Men?

The series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If: Event Horizon&quot; featuring the cover from the Spider-Man one-shot.

==Volume 6 (2007)==
The sixth series of &quot;What If?&quot; continued the theme of the previous series of examining possible alternatives for major storylines.

*&quot;What If: Planet Hulk&quot;
** What if Caiera had survived the destruction on Sakaar instead of the Hulk?
** What if the Hulk had landed on the planet the Illuminati had intended for him?
** What if the Hulk had reverted to Bruce Banner when he crashed on Sakaar?
*&quot;What If: Annihilation&quot;
** What if the Annihilation Wave reached Earth?
*&quot;What If: X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire&quot;
** What if Vulcan absorbed the energies of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal and became Phoenix?
*&quot;What If: Civil War&quot;
** What if Captain America led all the heroes against the Superhero Registration Act?
** What if Iron Man lost the Civil War?
*&quot;What If: Spider-Man vs. Wolverine&quot;
** What if Spider-Man had remained in 1980s Russia after an accidental death?

The series was also due to feature &quot;What If?: The New Fantastic Four&quot;, which featured the &quot;original&quot; New Fantastic Four with Spider-Man, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, and Hulk teaming up, as seen in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #347-349 and #374. This story was halted due to the death of artist Mike Wieringo, and was released as a 48-Page Special as a tribute in June 2008. All the issues of this run, aside from the New Fantastic Four one, were later collected into a trade paperback simply entitled &quot;What If? Civil War&quot;. The version of the &quot;New&quot; Fantastic Four is also erroneous, as the Ghost Rider of that time period had been Danny Ketch, not Johnny Blaze, who appears in the issue instead for unexplained reasons (in reality, Wieringo had drawn the wrong Ghost Rider in his initial pages by mistake and it was not noticed until after his death).

==Volume 7 (2008)==
This series continues the theme of alternatives for three recent Marvel events along with two around a classic event. The New Fantastic Four story was a sequel to the one-shot &quot;What If?&quot; released previously, seeing Iron Man replace Ghost Rider in an alternate take on the &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; storyline. However, this series also features a storyline featuring the Runaways that runs through all five comics. This series was released between December 2008 and January 2009.

* &quot;What If: House of M&quot; - What if the Scarlet Witch had said &#x27;No more powers&#x27; instead of &#x27;No more mutants&#x27;?
* &quot;What If: Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America&quot; - What if Iron Man had been killed instead of Captain America?
* &quot;What If: Newer Fantastic Four&quot; - What if the New Fantastic Four had battled Thanos?
* &quot;What If: Spider-Man: Back in Black&quot; - What if Mary Jane had been shot instead of Aunt May?
* &quot;What If: Secret Wars&quot; - What if Doctor Doom had kept the Beyonder&#x27;s power?
* &quot;What If: Runaways&quot; - What if the Runaways had become the Young Avengers? (Runs through all five above issues)

The seventh series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If?: Secret Wars&quot; featuring the cover from the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; one-shot.

==Volume 8 (2009)==
At Fan Expo Canada &#x27;09, it was revealed a new five-part &quot;What If&quot; series would be released, featuring five one-shot issues, each with two alternatives for the focused event, except for &quot;Daredevil vs. Elektra&quot;, which had only one story. As a back-up feature in the other four one-shot issues, there is a humorous &quot;Say What?&quot; short story.

*&quot;What If? Spider-Man: House of M&quot;
** What if Emma Frost had not mindwiped Gwen Stacy?
** What if the Scarlet Witch had let Gwen Stacy and her son cross to the default reality and survive?
*&quot;What If? Secret Invasion&quot;
** What if Reed Richards had been killed before revealing the Skrull weakness and the Skrulls won?
** What if the Skrulls had kept the invasion secret throughout all the campaign?
*&quot;What If? World War Hulk&quot;
** What if Tony Stark had not hesitated to use the Red Satellite on the Hulk in the final battle?
** What if Thor had battled the Hulk instead of the Sentry?
*&quot;What If? Daredevil vs. Elektra&quot;
** What if Daredevil had been shot and resurrected by the Hand instead of Elektra?
*&quot;What If? Astonishing X-Men&quot;
** What if Ord had resurrected Jean Grey instead of Colossus?
** What if Ultron became aware of Danger during her battle with the X-Men and planned to make her his bride?

The eighth series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If?: Secret Invasion&quot; featuring the cover from the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; one-shot.

==Volume 9 (2010)==
In early September 2010, Marvel announced a series of new &quot;What If?&quot; issues, including the celebration of the 200th issue of &quot;What If?&quot;. It features a story regarding the &quot;Siege&quot; event, and a story by Stan Lee about the Watcher and Galactus. Further &quot;What If&quot; stories were released for &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Grim Hunt&quot;, a story focusing on Wolverine and his son Daken, and another on the pre-hero and villain lives of Iron Man and Doctor Doom. Those four issues also have a back-up story on Deadpool being controlled by the Venom symbiote. The Venom/Deadpool backup chapters were subsequently released as a stand-alone one-shot.

*&quot;What If? Iron Man: Demon in an Armor&quot;
** What if Tony Stark became Doctor Doom?
** What if the Venom symbiote had managed to control Deadpool? (back-up story Part 1)
*&quot;What If? Wolverine: Father&quot;

==&quot;What If?: Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; (2013)==
In July 2013, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries for &quot;What If&quot; based on the 2012 event &quot;Avengers vs X-Men&quot;, telling the story of what might have happened if Magneto had been more influential in Hope&#x27;s development for Phoenix.

==&quot;What If: Age of Ultron&quot; (2014)==
In April 2014, Marvel released a five-issue miniseries for the 2013 event &quot;Age of Ultron&quot;, focusing on Wolverine and the Invisible Woman&#x27;s trip back in time to kill Hank Pym in order to stop him from creating Ultron and showing the effects for the Marvel Universe if one of the other four founding Avengers had died, or if Hank had simply chosen not to create Ultron at all.

* What if the Wasp had been killed instead of Hank Pym?
* What if Iron Man had been killed instead of Hank Pym?
* What if Thor had been killed instead of Hank Pym?
* What if Captain America had been killed instead of Hank Pym?
* What if Hank Pym had never created Ultron at all?

==&quot;What If? Infinity&quot; (2015)==
In October 2015, Marvel released a five-issue miniseries for the 2013 event &quot;Infinity&quot; that depicted alternate outcomes for Thanos&#x27; invasion of Earth and the war with the Builders. The five scenarios are the following:

*What if Thanos had joined the Avengers?
*What if Black Bolt had betrayed Earth?
*What if the X-Men were the sole survivors of &quot;Infinity&quot;?
*What if the Guardians of the Galaxy tried to free Thanos?
*What if the Green Goblin stole the Infinity Gauntlet?

==&quot;What If? With Great Power&quot; (2018)==
Marvel released a new series of &quot;What If?&quot; one-shot issues in October 2018, which revived the concept of the publisher&#x27;s classic series that examines alternate outcomes for major storylines and alternate versions of well-known characters such as Spider-Man, Magik, Ghost Rider, Thor, the X-Men, and the Punisher.

*What if Flash Thompson became Spider-Man?
*What if the X-Men were .EXE/Men?
*What if Peter Parker became the Punisher?
*What if Marvel Comics went Metal with the Ghost Rider?
*What if Thor was raised by Frost Giants?
*What if Magik became the Sorcerer Supreme?

The 13th series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;What If? With Great Power&quot; featuring the cover from the Punisher one-shot.

<text>In economics, the Jevons paradox (; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use (thereby reducing the amount needed for a single application); however, as the cost of using the resource drops, if the price is highly elastic, this results in overall demand increases causing total resource consumption to rise. Governments have typically expected efficiency gains to lower resource consumption, rather than anticipating possible increases due to the Jevons paradox.

In 1865, the English economist William Stanley Jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.

The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption rebound effects from improved energy efficiency. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This may counteract (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates economic growth, further increasing the demand for resources. The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and the improved efficiency results in a faster rate of resource utilization.

Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the effect, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as cap and trade or green taxes) can be used to control the rebound effect.

==History==
The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book &quot;The Coal Question&quot;. Jevons observed that England&#x27;s consumption of coal soared after James Watt introduced the Watt steam engine, which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired steam engine from Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s earlier design. Watt&#x27;s innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: &quot;It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.&quot;

At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England&#x27;s coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.

Although Jevons originally focused on coal, the concept has since been extended to other resources, e.g., water usage. The Jevons paradox is also found in socio-hydrology, in the safe development paradox called the &quot;reservoir effect&quot;, where construction of a reservoir to reduce the risk of water shortage can instead exacerbate that risk, as increased water availability leads to more development and hence more water consumption.

==Cause==


Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a &#x27;rebound&#x27; in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g., fuel) is used causes a decrease in the cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g., travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in fuel use from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.

The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e., demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.

As an example of where the paradox did not occur, large improvements in farming productivity (including the Third Agricultural Revolution) led to lower food prices but did not result in increased demand for food. (Demand for food is inelastic.) This instead led to lower employment in the farming sector, which declined from 40% of Americans in 1900 to less than 2% in 2024.

===Conditions===

The following conditions are necessary for a Jevons paradox to occur:

1) Technological change which increases efficiency or productivity

2) The efficiency/productivity boost must result in a decreased consumer price for such goods or services

3) That reduced price must drastically increase quantity demanded (demand curve must be highly elastic)

==Khazzoom–Brookes postulate==
In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society&#x27;s energy use. Brookes, then chief economist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.

In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the &quot;Khazzoom–Brookes postulate&quot;, and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under a wide range of assumptions.

According to Saunders, increased energy efficiency tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the microeconomic level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption. That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the macroeconomic level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, the technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use. 

==Energy conservation policy==

Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.

There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this &#x27;efficiency strategy&#x27; towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use. However, other environmental economists argue that, while the Jevons paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited.

The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g., if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with crude oil depletion. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g., a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.

The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that sustainable energy policy must rely on other types of government interventions as well. As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost-of-use do not display the Jevons paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect. To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g., green taxes, cap and trade, or higher emissions standards). The ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be &quot;taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation.&quot; By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.

== Other examples ==

=== Agriculture ===
Increasing the yield of a crop, such as wheat, for a given area will reduce the area required to achieve the same total yield. However, increasing efficiency may make it more profitable to grow wheat and lead farmers to convert land to the production of wheat, thereby increasing land use instead.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has referenced the Jevons paradox when describing artificial intelligence. Erik Brynjolfsson stated that he believes there will be some occupations for which the three conditions for the paradox will be met, thereby causing increased employment in those fields, such as radiologists, translators, and coders.

<doc id="988801" wikidata="Q3328684" url="?curid=988801" title="Music of Gabon">
<text>[[Gabon]]&#x27;s music includes several folk styles and pop. Gabonese pop artist Patience Dabany, who now lives in the US, produces albums recorded in Los Angeles with a distinctively Gabonese element; they are popular throughout Francophone Africa. Other musicians include guitarists Georges Oyendze, La Rose Mbadou and Sylvain Avara, and the singer Oliver N&#x27;Goma. Imported rock and hip hop from the US and UK are popular in Gabon, as are rumba, makossa and soukous.

==National music==
The national anthem of Gabon is &quot;La Concorde&quot;, written and composed by Georges Aleka Damas and adopted in 1960 upon independence.

==Traditional music==
Gabon&#x27;s population, estimated at 1,640,286, of whom 42% are minors (July 2013 est.), include four major Bantu groupings; the Fang, the Punu, the Nzebi and the Obamba.

Gabon, to the French ethnographer Barabe, &quot;is to Africa what Tibet is to Asia, the spiritual center of religious initiations&quot;, due to the sacred music of the Bwiti, the dominant religious doctrine of the country, variously ascribed to the Fang and the Mitsogho, which involves the use of iboga.

Gabonese folk instruments include the obala.

==Popular music==

The history of modern Gabonese music did not begin until about 1974, when the blind guitarist and singer Pierre Akendengué released his first album. He was classically trained in Europe, and his compositions reflect the influence of Western classical music. Akendengue&#x27;s European career started after being treated for eye disease at a hospital in Paris. He stayed, and studied at the Petit Conservatoire. By the 1970s, he was at the forefront of a wave of popular Francophone African music stars, beginning with the release of &quot;Nandipo&quot; in 1974. Akendegue was supported by Pierre Barouh, a powerful man in the French music industry, responsible for launching the careers of Brigitte Fontaine and Jacques Higelin, among others. Akendegue came to be seen as a spokesperson for the Gabonese people, and for the poor and dispossessed of all Africa. After spending twenty years in France, Akendegue returned to Gabon despite concerns over government censorship of his music. He wound up being appointed a government advisor.

The 1980s saw the formation of Africa No. 1, a radio station devoted to African music, and the opening of the first Gabonese recording studio, Studio Mademba. Musicians from across Africa and even in the Caribbean travelled to Libreville to record.

<text>An out-of-print (OOP) or out-of-commerce item or work is something that is no longer being published. The term applies to all types of printed matter, visual media, sound recordings, and video recordings. An out-of-print book is a book that is no longer being published. The term can apply to specific editions of more popular works, which may then go in and out of print repeatedly, or to the sole printed edition of a work, which is not picked up again by any future publishers for reprint. 

Most works that have ever been published are out of print at any given time, while certain highly popular books, such as the Bible, are always &quot;in print&quot;. Less popular out-of-print books are often rare and may be difficult to acquire unless scanned or electronic copies of the books are available. With the advent of book scanning, and print-on-demand technology, fewer and fewer works are now considered truly out of print.

A publisher creates a print run of a fixed number of copies of a new book. Print runs for most modern books number in the thousands. These books can be ordered in bulk by booksellers, and when all the bookseller&#x27;s copies are sold, the bookseller has the option to order additional copies. If the initial print run sells out and demand still exists, the publisher will have more copies printed, if possible. When the book is no longer selling either at a rate fast enough to pay for the inventory or stock costs, or to justify another print run, the publisher will cease to print additional copies, and may remainder or pulp the remaining unsold copies. When all of the books in a print run have been sold to booksellers, the book is said to be &quot;out of print&quot;, meaning that a bookseller cannot get any further copies from the publisher. If a book sells out unexpectedly quickly, it may be considered out of print briefly when its initial print run is exhausted, but is usually soon reprinted.

Publishers will often let a book go out of stock for long periods, then reprint the book, usually with a new cover and formatting, to catch the presumably built up demand for the book. The author or their estate may have copyright reverted to them once the publisher has declared it out of print.
Most publishing contracts contain reversion clauses allowing authors to regain the copyright to their books. One of the triggering conditions for this is an out-of-print clause which makes a book eligible for reversion to the author when a publisher no longer keeps a book in print. Often, rights do not automatically revert to the author. Instead, the author is responsible for requesting the book be put back in-print or, if the publisher declines, demand their rights back. 

In recent years, with the development of print-on-demand services and electronic formats of books, there has been much contention between publishers and authors as to what deems a book out-of-print. Publishers have begun to explicitly state which book formats qualify as in print, and typically include print-on-demand and electronic copies. 

At least one publishing company has adjusted their contracts to account for this change in publishing options by removing the lower limit for book sales, meaning that no matter how few copies of a book sells, if it is available through a print-on-demand vendor or electronically, it is still considered in-print.

The longer a book has been out of print, the more difficult it may be to obtain a copy. If there is enough demand for an out-of-print book, and all copyright issues can be resolved, another publisher may republish the book in the same manner as the original publisher might have reprinted it. In some cases, an out-of-print book, even one that sold very poorly, may be republished if the author becomes popular again.

A reader who wishes to purchase an out-of-print book must either find a bookseller who still has a copy, wait for another print run, or find someone who will sell their own copy as a used book. The advent of the Internet has made this process much easier, as many websites sell used books offered by bookstores and individuals.

Some publishers intentionally limit the print run of some or all titles to fewer copies than the anticipated demand, in creating limited editions marketed to collectors. In these cases, there is an implicit or explicit promise to collectors that the book will not be reprinted, at least in the same form as originally published. For instance, Madonna&#x27;s book &quot;Sex&quot;, with a limited edition print run, was the most requested out-of-print book from 2011 to 2015 in BookFinder.com and remains as one of the most in-demand out-of-print publications of all time according to Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

<text>The Pulaski Bridge in New York City connects Long Island City in Queens to Greenpoint in Brooklyn over Newtown Creek. It was named after Polish military commander and American Revolutionary War fighter Casimir Pulaski in homage to the large Polish-American population in Greenpoint. It connects 11th Street in Queens to McGuinness Boulevard (formerly Oakland Street) in Brooklyn.

==Description==

Designed by Frederick Zurmuhlen, the Pulaski Bridge is a bascule bridge, a type of drawbridge. Its span crosses Newtown Creek, Long Island Rail Road tracks, and the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel from south to north. The bridge carries six lanes of traffic and a pedestrian sidewalk; the pedestrian sidewalk is on the west or downstream side of the bridge, and has views of the industrial areas surrounding Newtown Creek, the skyline of Manhattan, and of a number of other bridges, including the Williamsburg Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, and the Kosciuszko Bridge. The bridge was reconstructed between 1991 and 1994.

Located just over from the start of the New York City Marathon at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Pulaski Bridge serves as the approximate halfway point in the race.

==History==
The Pulaski Bridge opened to traffic on September 10, 1954. It served as a replacement for the nearby Vernon Avenue Bridge, which had linked Vernon Avenue (now Vernon Boulevard) in Long Island City with Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint.

From 1979 until 1990, a message reading &quot;Wheels Over Indian Trails&quot; was painted on the Pulaski Bridge over the approach to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The artwork was created by John Fekner as a tribute to the thirteen Native American tribes who inhabited Long Island and referred to the changing traffic patterns on Vernon Boulevard, a former Indian trail.

In 2012, in response to the lack of adequate bicycle facilities currently on the Pulaski Bridge, the NYC Department of Transportation began studying the possibility of installing dedicated bicycle lanes on the bridge. Since the Pulaski is a drawbridge with an open section in the middle, it presents several challenges not faced by other bridges. First, physical dividers must be lightweight yet securely installed so they don&#x27;t come loose when the drawbridge is opened. Secondly, the joints where the two leaves come together must be somehow protected to make them more bicycle wheel-friendly. In April 2013, in a letter to Assembly Member Joe Lentol, the NYC Department of Transportation Commissioner stated that the proposal for a two-way dedicated bike lane, which would convert the existing walkway to a pedestrian-only path, had met the requirements of a traffic analysis and that an engineering study and recommendations would be made by the end of the year. On October 25, 2013, Lentol announced that the DOT was in the process of designing a dedicated bike lane and that the final design would be presented to community board 1 in Brooklyn and Community Board 2 in Queens before the end of the year. Bike lane construction was originally projected to occur late spring or early summer of 2014. Construction occurred during the winter of 2015 and the bike lane opened at the end of April 2016.

<text>Jocelyn Enriquez (born December 28, 1974) is a Filipino American dance-pop singer born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her most popular songs are &quot;Do You Miss Me&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit of Ecstasy&quot;, and the Stars on 54 (Enriquez alongside Ultra Naté and Amber) cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;. Her success helped inspire and pave the way for many Asian American, particularly Filipino Americans from the San Francisco Bay Area, artists during the mid to late 1990s such as Buffy, Kai, One Vo1ce, Pinay, Sharyn Maceren, and others.

==Career==
Enriquez was first heard singing at the age of 3 along to Anita Ward&#x27;s &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;. During her childhood, she received formal voice training with the San Francisco Girl Chorus and San Francisco Opera Company. During high school, she briefly joined girl group, Pinay Divas (later known as Pinay), a reference to girl group En Vogue who were known as the Funky Divas. She continued to perform around the Bay Area and eventually a demo of her singing &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; by Jaya caught the attention of Classified Records.

In late 1993, she recorded &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking About You&quot; and in early 1994, the single was a success. &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking About You&quot; would garner a huge Freestyle fanbase with the East Mix which included a popular Freestyle sample at the time of the Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. The single gained heavy rotation in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and New York. As an homage to Victor Zaragoza, the DJ who in part broke the record on Enriquez&#x27;s hometown radio station Wild 107.7, she recorded the song in Spanish too. Enriquez was labeled a &quot;sell-out&quot; by some members of the Philippine-American community because of her Spanish rendition of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking About You&quot;.

Her debut album, &quot;Lovely&quot; was released in the summer of 1994, which was produced by Glenn Gutierrez and Mario L. Augustin Jr. (who also worked with Stevie B and Jaya) and Elvin Reyes. The album &quot;Lovely&quot; spawned several more singles: &quot;Make This Last Forever&quot;, &quot;You Are the One&quot;, &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Big Love (Energy Box Mixes)&quot; and &quot;Only&quot;. &quot;Lovely&quot; was released in mid-1994. The third single released in late 1994, &quot;You Are the One&quot;, led her to perform in San Diego where she would be introduced to her future husband. The fourth single, &quot;Big Love&quot; was heavily inspired by Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot; would also be re-recorded, remixed and released as &quot;Big Love (Energy Box Mixes)&quot; as the album&#x27;s fifth single. The fifth and final single, &quot;Only&quot; was released on a 12&quot; single.

In April 1996, &quot;Do You Miss Me?&quot; would debut on Wild 107.7 and quickly gained traction. The single eventually became a top-40 hit on Dance and Pop radio (numbers 17 and 38, respectively), and peaked at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was also successful outside of the US, reaching the top 20 in Canada. The music video was shot over a year later as the single maintained a popularity well into 1997 internationally. In 1996, Classified Records formed a joint venture with Tommy Boy Records and its imprint Timber! Records, this catapulted &quot;Do You Miss Me?&quot; as an international hit. Pop punk band Lucky Boys Confusion later covered &quot;Do You Miss Me?&quot; on their 2001 album &quot;Throwing the Game&quot;.

The follow-up single, &quot;A Little Bit of Ecstasy&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart and number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The music video was directed by Francis Lawrence, who went on to direct Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; music video and the box office hits &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. The single was originally intended to be released in the fall of 1996, however, Jocelyn&#x27;s high school knee injury caught up to her and was not able to walk. However, due to scheduling, she still recorded the video with an injured knee. As a compromise, Jocelyn was lifted around set and stayed stationary for her shots. After filming, she had surgery and returned to the stage for the San Francisco Bammie Awards in early 1997. She won for &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; and performed &quot;A Little Bit of Ecstasy&quot; for the first time. The success of the single also led her perform on MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Grind&quot; and included in the box office hit &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; and its soundtrack. Years later, the song was licensed to the &quot;DDRMAX2&quot; PlayStation 2 game. A cover version by Josie was released on the &quot;Power Dance Hits Volume 1&quot; album.

The &quot;Jocelyn&quot; album was finally released in May 1997. The album peaked at number 182 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. The saw three commercially released singles: &quot;Do You Miss Me?&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit of Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Get Into the Rhythm&quot;. &quot;Even If&quot; was opted as a single, Soul Solution remix eventually leaked, however, the single never happened. &quot;Stay with Me&quot; was exclusively released as a single in Brazil. The album would pave the way for her to perform internationally and lead to the Jocelyn Philippines Album Tour. She made several appearances on TV, radio and venues. While on Showbiz Lingo Splash, she shared the stage with Filipina icons Pops Fernandez, Ella Mae, Verni Varga, Zsa Zsa and Jaya, where they closed the performance singing &quot;Even If&quot;.

Unfortunately, the joint venture between Classified Records and Tommy Boy Music ended and Enriquez opted to stay with Tommy Boy. She began working on material for her then third album which was intended to venture Jocelyn in a more Pop/R&amp;B sound incorporating her dance audience.

In 1998, Enriquez, Amber and Ultra Naté, joined for a cover the Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; as Stars on 54. The group&#x27;s rendition of &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; wound up impacting various charts worldwide, it landed at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs and number 52 on the Hot 100. The song would be the lead single for the film &quot;54&quot;″s soundtrack. The film&#x27;s initial cut was rejected by Miramax, which lead to the a new cut to be made. This led to the Stars on 54 cameo at end of the theatrical released edit. Enriquez&#x27;s response to appearing in the film &quot;My hair was so huge, oh my goodness. It was crazy! To be able film it at the actual venue, that was pretty cool.&quot;

The birth of her first child led to a brief hiatus and halt on her third album. In 2000, she returned with the Thunderpuss produced &quot;When I Get Close to You&quot; and reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. This single led her to being the vocalist for &quot;So Fabulous, So Fierce (Freak Out)&quot;, an interpolation of the disco anthem Chic&#x27;s &quot;Le Freak&quot;. The song appeared on the Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; film/soundtrack, and also appears in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; video game series.

After being released from Tommy Boy, Jocelyn landed a distribution deal with Bayside Entertainment in 2002. She then launched her own label J.E.M. Entertainment. Her third album, &quot;All My Life&quot;, was released in 2003. The first single of the album &quot;No Way No How&quot;, produced by Al B Rich and penned by Dee Roberts. The single peaked at number 17 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The second and last single from the album was &quot;Why&quot;. After the second single, she decided to focus on her family and faith and take a break from the music industry.

In 2018, she released the single &quot;To Love Again&quot;. This would also mark the 20-year anniversary of &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;, in which Enriquez was interviewed for the &quot;Billboard&quot; article &quot;Ultra Naté, Amber and Jocelyn Enriquez on their 1998 Stars on 54 collaboration &#x27;If You Could Read My Mind&#x27;&quot;. Enriquez reflected on how she landed on the single, &quot;They said, &quot;This is a good opportunity, but you have to go now!&quot; I want to say I was in New York within three days so that I could record the song. We would all sing different harmonies and ad-libs, but never really saw the big picture until the end. So it was kind of mysterious how we recorded it.&quot; The following year, Enriquez also embarked on a Philippines Tour to promote &quot;To Love Again&quot;.

In 2020, she released a re-recorded version of &quot;You Are the One&quot;. Production duo Black Caviar released a cover of &quot;A Little Bit of Ecstasy&quot; that same year. Her single, &quot;Beauty Comes Through Pain&quot; was released in the Philippines by Warner Music Philippines.

==Personal life==
She graduated from Pinole Valley High School in 1993. Enriquez is married to Pastor Alain Macasadia. They formerly served at Calvary Chapel of San Diego doing worship and children&#x27;s ministry. They moved to San Antonio in 2005. In 2006, Macasadia became the worship leader of Calvary Chapel San Antonio. They have four children, Matthew, Ashley, Jonathan, and Timothy.

<doc id="988815" wikidata="Q5445151" url="?curid=988815" title="Fernwood, Greater Victoria">
<text>Fernwood is a neighbourhood near downtown Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bounded by the neighbourhoods of North/South Jubilee, North Park, Fairfield, Rockland, Hillside-Quadra, Oaklands and Harris Green.

==Community==
The neighbourhood radiates out from the intersection of Gladstone and Fernwood Roads, where the Belfry Theatre sits. The Belfry Theatre has been producing plays in the heart of Fernwood since 1976. A thriving music and arts scene has resulted in events such as FernFest (since 1995), and the Fernwood Art Stroll (since 2008) which take place annually during the fourth weekend in June. Little Fernwood Hall houses The Pandora Arts Collective, Little Fernwood Gallery, and Theatre Inconnu.

The neighbourhood is enlivened by three schools with active extra-curricular programs, community celebrations, and involved Parent Advisory Councils: Victoria High School designed by C.E. Watkins Architect (the oldest public high school west of Winnipeg and north of San Francisco), Central Middle School, and George Jay Elementary. Several registered preschools and day care programs also nurture young families in the area.

The Compost Education Centre, two allotment gardens, and Spring Ridge Commons (a permaculture garden) are community-initiated projects that contribute to the character of the area. Fernwood is also home to many wellness and recreational groups, including the Fernwood Football Association (soccer).

Since 1979, Fernwood Neighbourhood Resource Group (Fernwood NRG) has provided child care, family support programs, and recreational activities through the Fernwood Community Centre. Fernwood NRG opened the Cornerstone Cafe and the Cornerstone Building affordable housing apartments in 2006, and in 2008 opened Park Place affordable housing apartments. In 2013, Fernwood NRG opened Studio 1313 Hair Design. These social enterprises continue to be operated by Fernwood NRG with all proceeds re-invested into neighbourhood programs and services (including events like FernFest &amp; Telephone Pole Painting). The Fernwood Community Centre is home to a Community Orchard &amp; Kitchen Garden Pilot Project. These projects demonstrate new ways of growing food in the City of Victoria in visible, public places.

The Fernwood Community Association facilitates land use discussions (between developers, residents, and the city), oversees emergency preparedness and safety issues, operates the two neighbourhood allotment gardens, and provides meeting space in Little Fernwood Hall for various community gatherings including Cafe Sympatico and recovery support groups.

Fernwood is known throughout the city as a particularly warm, creative, and engaged neighbourhood. Fernwood is sometimes referred to as &#x27;funky Fernwood&#x27; for its creative spirit and community vibe.

The &#x27;Fernwood Murder&#x27; of crows roosts on Walnut Street before nightfall during the summer and is noted on the Fernwood Community Map.

== History ==
The Fernwood area was part of the territory originally inhabited by the Songhees prior to the establishment of Fort Victoria. It is believed that a Songhees village may have been located at what is today Cadboro Bay. With the establishment of Fort Victoria, a trail linking the fort to Cadboro Bay ran through the area that would become Fernwood and was used by aboriginals and Europeans. 
Bishop Edward Cridge described the area as it was in the 1850s as &quot;open country without a house or field till we arrived at the Company&#x27;s farm [Cadboro Bay Farm]&quot;.

Early European settlers in the area included John Work, born in Donegal, Ireland who developed the Hillside Farm on the northwest edge of today&#x27;s Fernwood, and Benjamin Pearse. Pearse owned land between Denman Street and Pandora Avenue, bounded by Fernwood Road on the west and Belmont Avenue on the east. His home, Fernwood Manor, constructed in 1860, gave its name to the neighbourhood. After Pearse&#x27;s death in 1902, Pearse&#x27;s second wife, Sarah Jane Pearse resided there until her death in 1954. Fernwood Manor stood at Vining and Begbie Streets for 109 years before its demolition in 1969.

Historically, a spring in Fernwood supplied Victoria with its main source of water, hence the earlier name of the neighbourhood, Springridge. In 1875 Victoria began piping water from Elk Lake, and in 1885, the site of the original springs became the location of the Empire Brewery.

Residential development began in earnest in the 1890s, and many homes in western Fernwood and along Fernwood Road itself date from this era. In the early 1900s a large area west of Fernwood Road was used as a sand and gravel pit to supply construction materials to local builders, to the dismay of many early residents. The problem was partly solved by the construction of the present Victoria High School in 1912 on some of the lands that had been used as the sand and gravel pit.

Central Middle School stands on the site of the first public school, a wood-frame schoolhouse built in 1853 on the colonial school reserve. This building was replaced in 1876 by a building designed by Victoria architect John Teague, who also designed the Dominion Customs House on Wharf Street and Victoria City Hall. In turn, the 1876 school was replaced in 1902 by a brick building designed by Francis Rattenbury. However, the increase in Victoria&#x27;s population in the early 1900s made this building inadequate within 12 years. The present Central Middle School (formerly Central Junior High School), built in 1952, was designed by the Victoria architectural firm Birley Wade Stockdill.

The commercial heart of Fernwood developed along Fernwood road in the 1890s and early 1900s and many of the commercial buildings in the village date from this time in part due to the intersection of Gladstone road and Fernwood road acting as the terminus of the streetcar line connecting the neighbourhood to downtown. The building now housing the Belfry Theatre was built in 1892 as Emmanuel Baptist Church. Another small commercial node developed along Haultain Road. Most of the Fernwood neighbourhood was built up by the end of the real estate boom of 1913.

<text>The controversy over &quot;Fatal Vision&quot;, journalist and author Joe McGinniss&#x27;s best-selling 1983 true crime book, is a decades-long dispute spanning several court cases and discussed in several other published works.

&quot;Fatal Vision&quot; focuses on Captain Jeffrey R. MacDonald, M.D. and the February 17, 1970 murders of his wife and their two children at their home on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1979, MacDonald was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to life in prison. McGinniss was hired by MacDonald, prior to the start of the criminal trial, but he later became convinced that MacDonald was guilty, and the book supported MacDonald&#x27;s conviction.

The book sold well, and gave rise to a miniseries of the same name on NBC the next year. The book led to MacDonald suing McGinniss, a case that was settled out of court. The book and its conclusions were challenged by several subsequent publications.

==MacDonald murders and trial==
In the early morning hours of February 17, 1970, at their home on Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Green Beret Captain Jeffrey MacDonald, M.D., was injured, and his pregnant wife and two young daughters were murdered. MacDonald told Army investigators that they had been attacked by multiple assailants; the details were reminiscent of the sensational Tate-LaBianca murders of the preceding year.

After several months of investigation, Army lawyers charged MacDonald with the three murders, leading to a three-months-plus adversarial hearing that recommended he not be prosecuted. In 1971, his father-in-law, Freddy Kassab, became progressively suspicious of MacDonald and sought formal reopening of the case. In July 1974, a Federal judge acted on a citizen&#x27;s criminal complaint by Kassab and others, by putting the case before a grand jury. MacDonald was indicted for all three murders in January 1975, and after two rounds of appeals to Appeal and Supreme Courts, went to trial on July 16, 1979.

After a six-week criminal trial, MacDonald was convicted of second-degree murder of his wife and older daughter and of first-degree murder of his younger daughter on August 29, 1979 and was immediately sentenced to three consecutive life terms (equivalent to life imprisonment). Afterwards, MacDonald raised further appeals, one of which set him free on bail for about 15 months before yet another reversal by the Supreme Court in March 1982.

==&quot;Fatal Vision&quot;==

In June 1979, MacDonald had hired McGinniss to write a book about MacDonald&#x27;s innocence. Between the Supreme Court&#x27;s denial of review and the trial date, MacDonald arranged with McGinniss to interview him, attend the trial, and write a book about the case.

But McGinniss later became convinced that MacDonald was guilty of murdering his family. In the spring of 1983, McGinniss published &quot;Fatal Vision&quot;, saying that he had become convinced of MacDonald&#x27;s guilt early in his research due to MacDonald&#x27;s behavior and the court evidence, and presenting detailed arguments for guilt. As a motive, McGinniss suggests that MacDonald killed his family in a spur-of-the-moment, fit of psychotic rage as a result of taking amphetamines.

Around the time of the murders Fort Bragg had been experiencing problems and crime associated with drug-addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam.

==Lawsuits==

MacDonald expected that the book would show his innocence; however, like other authors MacDonald had contacted, McGinniss insisted on a signed release from MacDonald, allowing him to write freely, and the final version was precisely the opposite of what MacDonald had expected.

In 1984, MacDonald sued McGinniss for fraud and breach of contract, claiming he had breached an agreement to write a book about his innocence. In August 1987, the jury hearing the case deadlocked, and the case was settled out of court in November with MacDonald receiving $325,000.

The Kassabs, MacDonald&#x27;s in-laws, then sued MacDonald to try to prevent him from profiting from a crime for which he had been convicted. This suit was also settled, with the Kassabs receiving a percentage of the book&#x27;s profit, but also paying for MacDonald&#x27;s legal expenses.

==Subsequent publications==
In 1990, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Janet Malcolm published an article, &quot;The Journalist and the Murderer&quot;, with the thesis that journalism inevitably conflicts with morality as it is usually conceived; she considered &quot;Fatal Vision&quot; as the specific case leading her to this conclusion, and said that McGinniss committed a &quot;morally indefensible&quot; act in pretending that he believed MacDonald was innocent, even after he became convinced of his guilt.

In 1995, Jerry Allen Potter and Fred Bost published &quot;Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the MacDonald Murders&quot;, attacking the murder jury&#x27;s conclusions.

In 2012, Errol Morris published &quot;A Wilderness of Error&quot; reviewing the MacDonald case, including discussions of McGinniss&#x27;s book and Malcolm&#x27;s study.

In 2012 (after McGinniss&#x27;s diagnosis with terminal prostate cancer), McGinniss published an essay-length e-book, &quot;Final Vision: The Last Word on Jeffrey MacDonald&quot;, rebutting MacDonald&#x27;s assertions in his multiple post-1983 appeals.

In 2017 (after McGinniss&#x27;s death in 2014), the book was adapted into a film.

<text>Kamila Shamsie FRSL (; born 13 August 1973) is a Pakistani and British writer and novelist who is best known for her award-winning novel &quot;Home Fire&quot; (2017). Named on &quot;Granta&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 20 best young British writers, Shamsie has been described by &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; as &quot;a novelist to reckon with and to look forward to.&quot; She also writes for publications including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; and &quot;Prospect&quot;, and broadcasts on radio.

==Early life and education==
Shamsie was born into a well-to-do family of intellectuals in Karachi, Pakistan. Her mother is journalist and editor Muneeza Shamsie, her great-aunt was writer Attia Hosain and she is the granddaughter of memoirist Jahanara Habibullah. Her father is English.

Shamsie was brought up in Karachi, where she attended Karachi Grammar School. She went to the US as a college exchange student, and earned a BA in creative writing from Hamilton College, and an MFA from the MFA Program for Poets &amp; Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she was influenced by the Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali.

==Career==
Shamsie wrote her first novel, &quot;In the City by the Sea&quot;, while still in college, and it was published in 1998 when she was 25. It was shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in the UK, and Shamsie received the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literature in Pakistan in 1999. Her second novel, &quot;Salt and Saffron&quot;, followed in 2000, after which she was selected as one of Orange&#x27;s 21 Writers of the 21st century. Her third novel, &quot;Kartography&quot; (2002), received widespread critical acclaim and was also shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in the UK. According to the review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;: &quot;Shamsie&#x27;s cerebral, playful style sets her apart from most of her fellow subcontinental writers. Something of a cross between Arundhati Roy and Salman Rushdie, she deserves a larger readership in the U.S.&quot; Both &quot;Kartography&quot; and Shamsie&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Broken Verses&quot; (2005), have won the Patras Bokhari Award from the Academy of Letters in Pakistan. 

Shamsie&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Burnt Shadows&quot; (2009), was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction and won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for fiction. &quot;A God in Every Stone&quot; (2014) was shortlisted for the 2015 Walter Scott Prize and for the Baileys Women&#x27;s Prize For Fiction. According to Maya Jaggi&#x27;s review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Through its succession of seemingly disparate, acutely observed worlds, Burnt Shadows reveals the impact of shared histories, hinting at larger tragedies through individual loss.&quot; Shamsie&#x27;s seventh novel, &quot;Home Fire&quot;, described by the BBC as a &quot;powerful story of the complexities of love, family and state in wartime&quot;, was longlisted for the 2017 Booker Prize, shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award, and in 2018 won the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction. 

She is also the author of the non-fiction work &quot;Offence: The Muslim Case&quot; (Seagull Books, 2009). In 2009, Shamsie donated the short story &quot;The Desert Torso&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project – four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the &quot;Air&quot; collection. She attended the 2011 Jaipur Literature Festival, where she spoke about her style of writing. She participated in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot;, with a piece based on a book of the &quot;King James Bible&quot;.

Shamsie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2011. In 2013, she was included in the &quot;Granta&quot; list of 20 best young British writers.

She has contributed to such international events as the Cleveland Humanities Festival and the NGC Bocas Lit Fest in Trinidad, in 2016, and is a patron of the Manchester Literature Festival. In 2017, she joined the Manchester Centre for New Writing, where she is Professor of Creative Writing.

She delivered the 2018 Orwell Lecture at University College London, with the title &quot;Unbecoming British: citizenship, migration and the transformation of rights into privileges&quot;.

In 2021, Shamsie was a judge for the Goldsmiths Prize, alongside Nell Stevens, Fred D&#x27;Aguiar and Johanna Thomas-Corr.

==Personal life==
Shamsie states that she considers herself Muslim. She moved to London in 2007 and is now a dual national of the UK and Pakistan.

In 2012, she joined the latest incarnation of the Authors XI cricket team, despite never having played the game before. She contributed a chapter, &quot;The Women&#x27;s XI&quot;, to the book &quot;The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon&quot; (2013), collectively written by members of the team to chronicle their first season together.

<text>The Canary Current is a wind-driven surface current that is part of the North Atlantic Gyre. This eastern boundary current branches south from the North Atlantic Current and flows southwest about as far as Senegal where it turns west and later joins the Atlantic North Equatorial Current. The current is named after the Canary Islands. The archipelago partially blocks the flow of the Canary Current (Gyory, 2007).

This wide and slow moving current is thought to have been exploited in the early Phoenician navigation and settlement along the coast of western Morocco and Old Spanish Sahara. The ancient Phoenicians not only exploited numerous fisheries within this current zone, but also established a factory at Iles Purpuraires off present day Essaouira for extracting a Tyrian purple dye from a marine gastropod murex species.

The current heavily influences the weather of the Canaries and coastal Morocco and Western Sahara , cooling down shoreline temperatures for much of the year and also causing vast deserts on coastlines due to the absence of convection above the cool water. Winds from the vast Saharan Desert to the east may still bring hot temperatures also to coastal areas.

<doc id="988838" wikidata="Q57292154" url="?curid=988838" title="Sammie Abbott">
<text>Sammie Abdullah Abbott (April 25, 1908 - December 15, 1990) was an American politician who served as the 18th mayor of Takoma Park, Maryland, from 1980 to 1985.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Ithaca, New York, to Syrian Christian refugees fleeing Turkish persecution in Syria. He enrolled in Cornell University to study architecture but dropped out a few credits short of his degree to organize farmers and the unemployed in Buffalo, New York, and Niagara, New York, during the Great Depression. In 1938, he met his wife, Ruth, in a Buffalo jail when she came to visit her father, a bricklayer and union activist, who had been arrested with Abbott. Together, they moved to Washington, D.C., in 1940, and Abbott and his father-in-law built a house in Takoma Park.

When the United States entered World War II, Abbott enlisted in the Army Air Corps, serving in the European Theater and earning a Bronze Star.

==Post-war activism==
In the 1950s he actively campaigned for the adoption of the Bertrand Russell peace petition. He described himself as a Marxist, and in 1954, he was accused of being a member of the Communist party and called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. After his testimony, he was fired from his job as a commercial artist, turning to freelance work.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Abbott was one of the leaders of the Emergency Committee on the Transportation Crisis (ECTC), organizing the opposition to the construction of the North Central Freeway through Northeast Washington and Takoma Park, using the slogan, &quot;No white men&#x27;s roads through black men&#x27;s homes.&quot; He was also part of a group of local residents who organized against construction projects threatening Takoma Park. In 1978, Abbott helped to organize the first Takoma Park Folk Festival to raise money to save the Takoma Theater.

==Mayor of Takoma Park==
Abbott ran for mayor of Takoma Park in 1978, but lost by just 8 votes. He won the office in 1980, and was re-elected in 1982 and 1984. As mayor, he oversaw the institution of rent control, installed speed bumps and four-way stops to slow traffic, and he successfully blocked the closing of public schools in Takoma Park. During his tenure, Takoma Park declared itself a Nuclear-free zone and a sanctuary for Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees. Abbott declared Takoma Park &quot;Tree City, USA,&quot; and the city, which had been known as &quot;Tacky Park,&quot; acquired the nickname of the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Takoma.&quot;

In his bid for a fourth term in 1985, Abbott lost by just seven votes.

==Death and legacy==
Abbott died of myelodysplasia anemia on December 15, 1990, at his Takoma Park home. The Takoma Park City Council passed a resolution lowering the city flag to half-mast, and the Montgomery County Council declared January 5, 1991, Sammie Abbott Day. Hundreds attended a memorial service that was held at the Washington Ethical Society.

In 1991, Takoma Park added the name &quot;Sam Abbott Citizens&#x27; Center&quot; to its municipal building. In 2002, Abbott was inducted into the Montgomery County Human Rights Hall of Fame. In 2015, a plaque was dedicated for Abbott in the Citizens&#x27; Center. The plaque recognizes Abbott&#x27;s contributions to Takoma Park and concludes with a quote from him: &quot;If we can&#x27;t make it happen in Takoma Park, there&#x27;s no hope for the nation.&quot;

Abbott&#x27;s wife, Ruth, died in 2009, and they are survived by their children Nancy Abbott Young, Susan Abbott, and Abraham Abbott.

<text>Hina Jilani (؛ born 19 December 1953) is a lawyer at the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a human rights advocate from Lahore, Punjab. She co-founded Pakistan&#x27;s first all-women law firm, its first legal aid centre, and the Women&#x27;s Action Forum.

==Early life and education==
Jilani was born and raised in Lahore Pakistan. After law graduation, she started practising law in 1979 while joining the law chamber of barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi, while Pakistan was under martial law.

==Career==
In February 1980, with her sister Asma Jahangir, Jilani co-founded Pakistan&#x27;s first all-female legal aid practice, AGHS Legal Aid Cell (ALAC) in Lahore. Initially, its activities were confined to providing legal aid to women, but these activities gradually increased to include legal education, protection from exploitation, legal research, and counselling. She is also one of the founders of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan as well as the Women&#x27;s Action Forum (WAF), an advocacy group established in 1980 to campaign against discriminatory legislation. Jilani also founded Pakistan&#x27;s first legal aid centre in 1986. In addition to providing pro bono legal aid, she helped set up a women&#x27;s shelter called Dastak in 1991. In addition to managing the shelter, Dastak organises workshops to raise awareness for human rights and the protection of women.

Jilani is also affiliated with the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Carter Center, and the UN Conference on Women. In 2019, the UK Foreign Office appointed her to a panel of experts to develop legal frameworks to protect freedom of the press across the globe.

===Roles at the United Nations===
From 2000 to 2008, Jilani was the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders. During that period, she was also appointed to the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur in 2006.

In 2009, Jilani was appointed to the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict.

In 2017, Jilani co-chaired (alongside Tarja Halonen) the World Health Organization/Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights High-Level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children, and Adolescents.

==Threats==
As a result of their women&#x27;s activism, Jilani and her sister Asma Jahangir have been arrested, received death threats, and faced intimidation and public abuse. Murder attempts have been made on them as well as members of their family. In 1999, after working on the case of Samia Sarwar, Jilani and Jahangir were again subject to death threats. Sarwar&#x27;s mother came with a gunman to her office on the pretext of seeking reconciliation with her daughter. The gunman shot Sarwar dead and fired at Jilani, who managed to escape. On another occasion, gunmen entered her house and threatened members of her family. Jilani herself was away from home; the threats put pressure on her to migrate, but she continues to live and work in Lahore.

==Recognition==
* 2000 – Ginetta Sagan Award from Amnesty International
* 2001 – Millennium Peace Prize for Women
* 2008 – Editor&#x27;s Award for Outstanding Achievement by The Lawyer Awards
*2016 – Honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin

<doc id="988842" wikidata="Q1173268" url="?curid=988842" title="Dave Lee Travis">
<text>David Patrick Griffin (born 25 May 1945), known professionally as Dave Lee Travis, is an English former disc jockey, and former television presenter. 

Travis began his broadcasting career on the pirate radio station Radio Caroline in 1965. He moved to BBC Radio 1, where he became one of the station&#x27;s leading presenters during the 1970s and 1980s. He was a frequent presenter of BBC1 TV series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Following his resignation from the BBC in 1993, he worked for several British commercial radio stations.

In November 2012, Travis was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree on suspicion of historical sexual offences, which he denied. In February 2014, he was found not guilty on twelve of the counts, with the jury unable to reach a decision on a further two counts. Travis faced a retrial on the two outstanding counts, with an additional alleged offence from 1995. The retrial began on 5 September 2014. On 23 September, he was found guilty of one count of indecent assault and on 26 September given a three-month prison sentence suspended for two years.

==Early life and career==
Born in Buxton, Derbyshire, Travis was raised in Manchester. His father was a stage manager and he attended Manchester Central Grammar School for Boys.

Travis&#x27;s first jobs were as a graphic designer, a designer of shop interiors and a photographer. At night and weekends he began working as a DJ at the Oasis Club in Manchester, making use of a Dansette autochanger. Giving up his other jobs, he went on a self-created and promoted UK tour of clubs, ballrooms and theatres presenting his own DJ shows. Consequently, he was asked by Herman&#x27;s Hermits to become the tour manager and warm-up DJ on their next tour of the United States, supporting Bobby Vee and Freddy Cannon. On his return to the UK, Travis returned to the north of England and continued to promote his own shows in Blackpool, Bury and the surrounding areas.

==Radio==
===Radio Caroline===
In September 1965, Travis started work at the offshore pirate radio station Radio Caroline South from the MV &quot;Mi Amigo&quot; off the Essex coast, later moving onto Radio Caroline North from the MV &quot;Fredericia&quot; off the Isle of Man until mid-August 1967. From spring 1966 until early 1969 he co-presented the monthly &quot;Beat-Club&quot; pop programme, on television in Germany together with Uschi Nerke.

===BBC Radio 1===
In 1967, offshore pirate radio was outlawed by the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. Travis returned to Manchester to present the daily radio show &quot;Pop North&quot; on Radio 1 in 1968, and hosted Saturday afternoon programmes in the 4 to 5:30pm slot. In 1969, he took over a Sunday morning show from 10am to midday. In 1971, he was promoted to the weekday lunchtime show from 11am to 1pm, moving back to Sunday mornings in 1973 and also presenting the &quot;Radio 1 Club&quot; on Thursdays from 5 to 7pm. He also presented the Sunday afternoon request show between 3 and 5pm.

In 1976, Travis took over the weekday teatime slot, 4:305:45pm (extended to run 4:307pm in 1977). He then took over &quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; from Noel Edmonds on 2 May 1978 and continued in this slot until 2 January 1981. He nicknamed himself &quot;the Hairy Cornflake&quot; during his time as the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; host.

In 1976, an on-air parody of C. W. McCall&#x27;s US hit &quot;Convoy&quot; led to a release of the song &quot;Convoy GB&quot; as a single, recorded with fellow DJ Paul Burnett under the name Laurie Lingo and the Dipsticks. The song reached number four in the UK Singles Chart and Travis appeared as the song&#x27;s narrator &quot;Super Scouse&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

In January 1981, Travis moved to weekday afternoons from 2:30 to 4:30pm. Later that year he moved back to the weekday lunchtime slot from 11:30am to 2pm, before moving to a Saturday morning show in 1983 from 10am to 1pm, then Sunday mornings from 10am to 1pm in 1987, taking over both Saturday and Sunday in September 1988.

===On-air resignation===
On 8 August 1993, Travis resigned on-air during his Sunday morning show, stating that he could not agree with changes that were being made to Radio 1. Travis told his audience that changes were afoot that he could not tolerate &quot;and I really want to put the record straight at this point and I thought you ought to know – changes are being made here which go against my principles and I just cannot agree with them&quot;.

===&quot;A Jolly Good Show&quot;===
From 1981 to 2001, Travis presented the BBC World Service music request programme &quot;A Jolly Good Show,&quot; having taken over from Noel Edmonds. In June 2011, Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi said the programme had given her a lifeline. The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who had spent 15 years under house arrest from 1989, told the BBC that &quot;A Jolly Good Show&quot; had made her &quot;world much more complete&quot;. Travis said he was &quot;touched&quot; but &quot;not surprised&quot; that she had remembered it.

===Since 1993===
On leaving Radio 1, Travis hosted a networked Sunday morning show (10am1pm) across some of the UK&#x27;s commercial radio stations. He also went to Classic Gold where he hosted the 10am1pm morning show (later 9amnoon), before moving to breakfast 7am9am and then back to mornings 9am11am.

In 2002, Travis left Classic Gold to work for the British Army&#x27;s Garrison FM. From March 2003 to March 2007, Travis returned to the BBC, and presented a Sunday morning show from 9am to noon on BBC Three Counties Radio, his local BBC radio station.

Travis is a member of the Radio Academy Hall of Fame.

Travis worked at the Magic Network from July 2006 until 2012. Following his arrest on sexual assault allegations, the station suspended him and did not renew his contract.

Travis returned to the radio in April 2018 presenting a Saturday show on United DJs Radio. He left in September 2018 due to back pain but returned on 29 February 2020. United DJs Radio closed down in May 2021.

==Television==
Travis presented the German TV show &quot;Beat-Club&quot;, where he introduced such acts as Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Steamhammer.

In November 1973, Travis first presented BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; as a replacement for Kenny Everett. Travis remained a regular presenter through 1984. He was also the presenter of &quot;The Golden Oldie Picture Show&quot; in the mid-1980s, an attempt by the BBC to create videos for classic pop songs that pre-dated the video age.

Travis provided the UK commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 in Dublin, Ireland, and in 1985 presented the Eurovision Song Contest Previews on BBC1.

On 14 February 2000, Travis was the subject of the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; programme on British TV.

Travis narrated various Granada Men &amp; Motors programmes, such as &quot;Top Ten Bikes&quot;.

In 2007, Travis appeared in the video for the Comic Relief version of the Proclaimers song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, performed by Peter Kay and Matt Lucas.

Other TV appearances include &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot;, &quot;Stars Reunited&quot;, &quot;Kick Start&quot;, &quot;Dave&#x27;s Lee&#x27;s and Travis&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot;.

== Conviction for indecent assault==
In October 2012, two former BBC employees alleged that Travis had sexually assaulted several women during his time at the BBC. One of the women, who was 17 at the time, claimed in the media after making a formal statement to police that Travis put his hand up her skirt in 1977. The other, presenter Vivien Creegor, claimed Travis &quot;jiggled her breasts&quot; when she was live on BBC Radio 4 in the 1980s. 
On 15 November 2012, Travis was arrested at his home by the Metropolitan Police as part of the Operation Yewtree inquiry. He was the fourth person to be arrested as part of the investigation.

In October 2013, Travis was charged with 14 allegations of indecent assault and one of sexual assault between 1976 and 2008, relating to 11 female complainants aged between 15 and 29 at the time of the alleged offences. He pleaded not guilty and the trial began in January 2014 at Southwark Crown Court. On 13 February, Travis was found not guilty on twelve counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on the remaining two counts. Following the verdict, Travis told reporters &quot;I do not feel like there is a victory in any way, shape or form. On the contrary, I think you already know that I have been through a year-and-a-half of hell on this.&quot; On 24 February, it was reported that the prosecution was seeking a retrial on the two outstanding counts.

On 28 March 2014, it was reported Travis would face another charge of indecent assault as well as the retrial on the two outstanding counts. On 15 April, it was reported he was facing another charge of indecent assault on a woman aged over 16 in 1995. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on 24 April, where he denied the charges. His trial began on 5 September at Southwark Crown Court. On 23 September, Travis was found guilty of indecently assaulting a female researcher working on &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; in 1995. He was found not guilty of indecently assaulting another woman while appearing in a production of &quot;Aladdin&quot; in 1990. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third charge from 2008, involving a journalist who visited his home. On Friday 26 September 2014 he was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years.

The Attorney General&#x27;s office rejected four complaints that the sentence was too lenient. On 8 December 2015, the Court of Appeal rejected Travis&#x27;s bid to overturn his conviction.

As a result of his conviction, episodes of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; that were presented by Travis are no longer repeated.

==Personal life==
Travis lives in Buckland, Buckinghamshire. On 6 May 1971, he married Marianne Bergqvist, who came originally from Sweden.

His interests include photography and classic cars. In 1987, he published a book of his photographs of well-known women, called &quot;A Bit of a Star&quot;, which he dedicated to his late father. In the 1970s, Travis was a regular drag racer.

<doc id="988855" wikidata="Q4199082" url="?curid=988855" title="Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah">
<text>[[Begum]] Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah (22 July 1915 – 11 December 2000) was a Bengali Pakistani politician, diplomat and author. She was the first Muslim woman to earn a PhD from the University of London. She was Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Morocco from 1964 to 1967, and a delegate to the United Nations, calling for a more gender-inclusive language in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==Family and education==
Ikramullah was born as Shaista Akhtar Banu Suhrawardy into the Suhrawardy family to Hassan Suhrawardy and his wife Sahibzadi Shah Banu Begum. Sahista&#x27;s mother was Nawab Abdul Latif&#x27;s granddaughter.

She studied at Loreto College, Kolkata. She was also the first Muslim woman to earn a PhD from the University of London. Her doctorate thesis, &quot;Development of the Urdu Novel and Short Story&quot;, was a critical survey of Urdu literature.

==Marriage and children==
She married Mohammed Ikramullah in 1933. They had four children:
* Imam Ikramullah
* Naz Ashraf
* Salma Sobhan
* Princess Sarvath of Jordan

==Political career==
After her marriage, she was one of the first Indian Muslim women in her generation to leave purdah. Muhammad Ali Jinnah inspired her to be involved in politics. She was a leader in the Muslim Women Student&#x27;s Federation and the All-India Muslim League&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Sub-Committee.

In 1945, she was asked by the Government of India to attend the Pacific Relations Conference. Jinnah convinced her not to accept the offer, as he wanted her to go as the representative of the Muslim League and to speak on its behalf.

She was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1946, but never took the seat, as Muslim League politicians did not.

She was one of two female representatives at the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in 1947.

She was also a delegate to the United Nations, and worked on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Convention Against Genocide (1951).

She was Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Morocco from 1964 to 1967.

==Publications==
She wrote for &quot;Tehzeeb-e-Niswan&quot; and &quot;Ismat&quot;, both Urdu women&#x27;s magazines, and later wrote for English-language newspapers. In 1950 her collection of short stories, called &quot;Koshish-e-Natamaam&quot;, was published. In 1951 her book &quot;Letters to Neena&quot; was published; it is a collection of ten open letters supposedly written to Indians, who are personified as a woman called Neena. The real Neena was one of her in-laws. After the Partition of India, she wrote about Islam for the government, and those essays were eventually published as &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; (1953). Her autobiography, &quot;From Purdah to Parliament&quot; (1963), is her best-known writing; she translated it into Urdu to make it more accessible. In 1991 her book &quot;Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy: A Biography&quot;, about her uncle, was published. She also was one of the eight writers of the book &quot;Common Heritage&quot; (1997), about India and Pakistan. In her last days, she completed an English translation of &quot;Mirat ul Uroos&quot; and an Urdu volume on &quot;Kahavat aur Mahavray&quot;. In 2005 her collection of women&#x27;s sayings and idioms in Urdu, called &quot;Dilli ki khavatin ki kahavatain aur muhavare&quot;, was posthumously published. She also wrote &quot;Safarnama&quot;, in Urdu.

==Death==
She died on 11 December 2000, in Karachi, at age 85.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2002, President of Pakistan posthumously gave her the highest civil award, Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Order of Excellence) award.

<text>Delaware&#x27;s at-large congressional district is a congressional district that includes the entire U.S. state of Delaware. It is the nation&#x27;s oldest congressional district, having existed uninterrupted since the 1st United States Congress in 1789. It is also the most populous congressional district in the nation. Delaware has always had only one member of the United States House of Representatives, except for a single decade from 1813 to 1823, when the state had two at-large members. The two seats were filled by a statewide ballot, with the two candidates receiving the highest votes being elected.

Mike Castle, a Republican and former governor of Delaware, held this seat from January 1993 until his retirement in January 2011, after his unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination to run for U.S. Senator. Even as Delaware swung heavily Democratic at the state and national level, Castle was usually reelected without serious difficulty. Since his retirement, however, the Democrats have held it with no substantive opposition.

The district is currently represented by Sarah McBride, a Democrat, who was first elected in 2024. McBride is the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.

<doc id="988868" wikidata="Q701399" url="?curid=988868" title="William J. Crowe">
<text>William James Crowe Jr. (January 2, 1925 – October 18, 2007) was a United States Navy admiral and diplomat who served as the 11th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and as the ambassador to the United Kingdom and Chair of the Intelligence Oversight Board under President Bill Clinton.

==Early life and education==
Crowe was born in La Grange, Kentucky on January 2, 1925. At the beginning of the Great Depression, Crowe&#x27;s father moved the family to Oklahoma City. In June 1946, Crowe completed a war-accelerated course of study and graduated with the Class of 1947 from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Career==
From 1954 to 1955, Crowe served as assistant to the naval aide of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. While serving in Eisenhower&#x27;s White House in Spring of 1955, Crowe was tasked with figuring out a way to rid the White House lawn of squirrels, which were impacting the golfing greens Eisenhower had built on the lawn. From 1956 to 1958, Crowe served as executive officer of the submarine (SS-565).

In 1958, he served as an aide to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. In 1960, Crowe took command of (SS-566), homeported in Charleston, South Carolina, and served as commanding officer of that ship until 1962. From there, Crowe earned a master&#x27;s degree in education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. After turning down an invitation from Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to enter the Navy&#x27;s nuclear power program, Crowe earned a Ph.D. in politics from Princeton University in 1965 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;The policy roots of the modern Royal Navy 1946-1963.&quot;

During the Vietnam War he was the senior adviser to the Vietnamese Riverine Force. In 1969, he took command of Submarine Division 31, homeported in San Diego, California.

A long string of assignments followed:
*1967 – Head of East Asia Pacific Branch, Politico-Military Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations
*1970 – Senior adviser to the Vietnamese Navy Riverine Force
*1973 – promoted to rear admiral and named Deputy Director, Strategic Plans, Policy, Nuclear Systems, and NSC Affairs Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations
*1975 – Director, East Asia and Pacific Region, Office of the Secretary of Defense
*1976 – Commander, Middle East Force (COMMIDEASTFOR)
*1977 – promoted to vice admiral and named Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Plans, Policy and Operations
*1980 – promoted to admiral and named Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH)
*1983 – as CINCSOUTH, named Commander-in-Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR)
*1983 – Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Command (CINCPAC)

On July 10, 1985, Crowe was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). He continued to serve as CJCS through the Bush administration until 1989, when he retired from active duty. He was the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to serve under the provisions of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, where he as chairman became (not the collegial body of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), by statute, the principal military adviser to the president, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. On October 1, 1989, Army General Colin L. Powell succeeded him as CJCS.

==Later life and death==
On March 16, 1989, he made a cameo appearance in the “Hot Rocks” episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;.

After he retired in October 1989, Crowe returned to the University of Oklahoma and William J. Crowe chair in geopolitics. Crowe surprised politicians when he endorsed Bill Clinton in the presidential election of 1992. President Clinton named Crowe chairman of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in 1993. In 1994, Clinton appointed Crowe the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and he served in that capacity until 1997.

Crowe sat on the boards of Texaco, Merrill Lynch, Pfizer, Norfolk Southern Corporation, and General Dynamics. He also served on the board of Emergent BioSolutions (then Bioport), a company that provided controversial anthrax vaccinations to the U.S. military in the 1990s. The deal was approved by the Clinton administration, with which Crowe had a previous relationship. At the time of his death, Crowe served as the chairman of the board of Global Options, Inc., an international risk-management and business solutions company headquartered in Washington, D.C.

As he did at the University of Oklahoma in 1990–91, Crowe taught a seminar class on national security at the United States Naval Academy from 2000 to 2007.

In 2004, Crowe was among 27 retired diplomats and military commanders called Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change who publicly said the administration of President George W. Bush did not understand the world and was unable to handle &quot;in either style or substance&quot; the responsibilities of global leadership.

On June 16, 2004, the former senior diplomats and military commanders issued a statement against the Iraq War.

==Death==
Crowe died on October 18, 2007, at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland at age 82 due to a heart condition.

His funeral was held on October 31, 2007, at the Naval Academy chapel; Bill Clinton spoke. Crowe was buried later that day in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery. 

As of 2016, he is one of only two deceased former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to not be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His predecessor, John William Vessey Jr. died in 2016 and was buried in Minnesota State Veterans Cemetery, Little Falls, Minnesota.

==Legacy==
In 2008, a fellowship was established in Crowe&#x27;s honor at the University of Kentucky&#x27;s Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce to support a former member of the U.S. armed forces who – like Crowe – is shifting from military to diplomatic service.

In 2009, the International Programs Center at the University of Oklahoma established the Admiral William J. Crowe Jr. Award. This award is presented to an outstanding International and Area Studies (IAS) graduate every spring semester. The award recognizes an IAS student who has demonstrated high academic achievement, a commitment to public service, and a desire to pursue a career in global affairs.
Also in 2009, the Xbox/ PS2 game, &quot;Heroes of the Pacific&quot;, was released. The main character&#x27;s name is also William Crowe, though whether or not this was inspired by the real-life Crowe is unknown.

==Personal life==
Crowe married to Shirley Grennell in 1954. They had three children.

==Dates of rank==
* Apprentice Seaman, United States Naval Reserve: December 4, 1942
* Midshipman, United States Naval Academy: June 23, 1943

*&quot;At the time of Admiral Crowe&#x27;s promotion, all rear admirals wore two stars, but the rank was divided into an &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower half&quot; for pay purposes&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
Crowe was awarded Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) honorary degrees from numerous universities, including University of Liverpool, The George Washington University, and Knox College.

In 1986, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Bernard W. Rogers, USA.

In 1989, Crowe appeared in an episode of the television sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (Season 7, Episode 17 &quot;Hot Rocks&quot;), where he played himself, and was accused of stealing the General Manager Rebecca Howe&#x27;s (Kirstie Alley) diamond earrings.

On 1990, he was the first recipient of the Distinguished Sea Service Award of Naval Order of the United States.

In 1993, Crowe published his memoirs in the book &quot;The Line of Fire: From Washington to the Gulf, the Politics and Battles of the New Military&quot;.

Crowe received four Defense Distinguished Service Medals and numerous military decorations from heads of state. In 1998, the American Atatürk Association honored Crowe with the &quot;Atatürk Peace and Democracy Award&quot;. Following his retirement from the Navy, he was awarded a 2000 Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; highest civilian honor.

<doc id="988869" wikidata="Q5865060" url="?curid=988869" title="History of Johannesburg">
<text>Johannesburg is a large city in Gauteng Province of South Africa. It was established as a small village controlled by a Health Committee in 1886 with the discovery of an outcrop of a gold reef on the farm Langlaagte. The population of the city grew rapidly, becoming a municipality in 1898. In 1928 it became a city making Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. In 2002 it joined ten other municipalities to form the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Today, it is a centre for learning and entertainment for all of South Africa. It is also the capital city of Gauteng.

==Prehistoric Era==
The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. The Magaliesberg valley north of Johannesburg was ideal for farming, and farmers settled there by the 6th century. By the 13th century, stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns (e.g. Kweneng) and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated. Many of these sites contain the ruins of Sotho–Tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold. The most prominent site within Johannesburg is Melville Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace.

==Republican Era==

===European Settlement and gold mining===

After the Great Trek European pastoralists also started settling in the Transvaal. Some of them chose to farm where Johannesburg was to rise later. Each &quot;burgher&quot; (citizen) was entitled to at least one farm, measuring 1500 morgen or about 3100 acres. The first recorded discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand was made by Jan Gerrit Bantjes in June 1884, on the farm Vogelstruisfontein. Other farms to become famous later included Langlaagte, Turffontein, Doornfontein and Braamfontein. George Harrison is today credited as the man who discovered an outcrop of the Main Reef of gold on the farm Langlaagte in February 1886. On 12 May 1886 Harrison and his partner, George Walker, entered into a prospecting agreement with the owner of Langlaagte, one G.C. Oosthuizen. Two days later Colonel Ignatius Ferreira staked out his camp on Turffontein to serve as a centre for diggers. Louwrens Geldenhuys found the Main Reef on Turffontein and Henry Nourse located it on Doornfontein. On 8 September 1886 nine farms, extending from Driefontein in the east to Roodepoort in the west, were declared public diggings Carl von Brandis was appointed as the mining commissioner for the area. On 8 November 1886 a diggers&#x27; committee was elected to assist the mining commissioner in the execution of his duties.
The earliest mining activities were concentrated along and adjacent to the outcrops of the main reef. Initially the diggers could perform the work themselves, using relatively little equipment. As the pits grew deeper, they needed additional labourers and machinery. Black Africans were recruited to perform the unskilled work. Machinery had to be imported from Europe and fuel had to be found to power the machinery. The discovery of coal on the far east Rand at Springs and Boksburg, as well as the construction of the Rand Steam Tram from the colliery to the gold fields and into Johannesburg facilitated the growth of the industry in its early years. Soon, too, the railway arrived from the coast: in September 1892 the Cape railway reached the Rand. Two years later the line from Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) arrived in the Republic and a third route was opened from Durban the next year. In 1890 the MacArthur-Forrest cyanidation process successfully overcame the problems of treating the refractory ore from deeper levels.

It soon became apparent that individual diggers were not equal to the task of mining gold in Johannesburg. Wealth could only be recovered by means of deep-shaft working and by capital-intensive companies having the necessary technical skills. Individual claims were soon joined into small mining groups. The amalgamation of smaller mining groups became a common occurrence and by 1895 the scene was dominated by a limited number of large monopolistic companies. These companies were: the Wernher-Beit-Eckstein group, Consolidated Goldfields, the J B Robinson group, the S. Neumann group, the Albu group, the A Goerz group, the Anglo-French group and the Lewis-Marks group. Of these, Cecil John Rhodes&#x27;s Consolidated Goldfields was the most important.

In 1893 Johannesburg&#x27;s first stock exchange was opened. From then until today Johannesburg has been the seat of the South African stock exchange and the country&#x27;s financial heartland. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is presently in Sandton, Johannesburg.

The Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic became the single biggest gold producer in the world, with a contribution of 27,5 percent in 1898.

===Founding of a city===
The fledgling town of Johannesburg was laid out on a triangular wedge of &quot;uitvalgrond&quot; (area excluded when the farms were surveyed) named Randjeslaagte, situated between the farms Doornfontein to the east, Braamfontein to the west and Turffontein to the south. The property belonged to the government. The Surveyor-General of the ZAR issued an instruction that the farm be surveyed as a township, consisting of 600 stands measuring fifty feet by fifty feet. The first auction of stands took place on 8 December 1886. The settlement was named after two officials of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR), Christiaan Johannes Joubert and Johannes Rissik, who both worked in land surveying and mapping. The two men combined the name they shared, adding &#x27;burg&#x27;, the archaic Afrikaans word for &#x27;fortified city&#x27;.

Early in 1887 the inhabitants started petitioning the government to proclaim a town council for the area. Eventually in November 1887 a proclamation was issued instituting a health committee. Its area was defined as &quot;the place Johannesburg, including the stands known as Marshall Town and Ferreira&#x27;s Town&quot;. The committee&#x27;s authority extended for a radius of three miles from the market square. The mining commissioner and the district surgeon were to be ex-officio members of the committee. The area of the committee&#x27;s jurisdiction was to be divided into five wards. Each ward could elect one committee member. All adult male inhabitants had the vote. In 1890 six wards were proclaimed, each ward being entitled to elect two committee members.

It was only in 1897 that the government approved, in terms of Act 9 of 1897, a town council for Johannesburg. In terms of the Act the area was divided into 12 wards. Each ward could elect two town councillors, one of which had to be a citizen of the ZAR. Johan Zulch de Villiers became the first mayor of Johannesburg in October 1897.

The Rissik Street Post Office was built in 1897, having been designed by the architect Sytze Wierda. The Post Office was at one time the tallest building in Johannesburg. The Post Office became a national monument in 1978, and it remained in operation until 1996 when the South African Post Office vacated the building. The monument was gutted by a fire in 2009. The old City Hall is opposite the Post Office in Rissik Street.

===Gold rush===
Within ten years of the discovery of gold in Johannesburg by Jan Gerrit Bantjes, 100 000 people flocked to this part of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic in search of riches. Colonials, escaping the boredom of small-town life, joined Indians trekking from the sugar fields of Natal. Cape Coloureds and Chinese shopkeepers mixed with Africans, eager to experience the fast pace of urban life. Artisans and miners from the gold and silver fields of the Americas and Australia, from coal and tin mines of Europe, joined the wagon loads of men who had learnt their craft in the pits of Kimberley. Jews in search of freedom and employment, headed south to Africa from Eastern Europe and Russia. Mine managers and businessmen, solicitors and engineers, men with skills, education and contacts, confident of their expertise and frequently arrogant in their manner, took up positions in the burgeoning city of Johannesburg and in the new mines along the reef. In addition there were the pimps and adventurers, crooks and philanderers.
In January 1890 the Health Committee conducted its first census of the town. They found that Johannesburg had 26 303 inhabitants. There were 13 820 buildings, of which 772 were shops and stores and 261 hotels and bars. The following suburbs were recorded: Booysens, Fordsburg, Langlaagte, Braamfontein, Auckland Park, Marshall&#x27;s Town, Ferreira&#x27;s Town, Prospect and Jeppe&#x27;s Town. There was also a Coolie Location and a Veldtschoendorp, the latter being a shanty town occupied by Dutch citizens of the ZAR.

Another census was conducted in January 1896. It was recorded that Johannesburg then had 102 078 inhabitants, of whom 61 292 lived within the three mile radius of Market Square and 40 786 outside. There were 50 907 Europeans or Whites, 952 Malays, 4 807 Asiatics, 2 879 mixed or other races and 42 533 Natives of whom 14 195 lived within the three mile radius and 28 838 outside. Of the 24 489 Whites born in Europe, 12 389 were from England and Wales, 997 from Ireland and 2 879 from Scotland. Of the 24 500 Europeans born in Africa, 6 205 were born in the Transvaal and 15 162 in the Cape Colony. New suburbs included: Klipfontein, Forest Town, Hillbrow, Berea, Yeoville, Bellevue, Houghton, Vrededorp, Paarl&#x27;s Hoop, Robinson, Ophirton, La Rochelle, Rosettenville, Klipriviersberg, City &amp; Suburban, Doornfontein, Bertrams, Lorentzville and Troyeville. It was also recorded that there was a Malay Camp, Brickfields, a Coolie Location and a Kafir Location. Kliptown is the oldest Black residential district of Johannesburg and was first laid out in 1891 on land which formed part of Klipspruit farm.
===Society===
From the start the city segregated itself spatially in terms of class and, to a lesser extent, race. Julius Jeppe and his partner, Lewis Peter Ford, bought a portion of the farm Turffontein. They had two townships surveyed and called them Fordsburg and Jeppestown. Both were next to the mines along the Main Reef. The stands in Fordsburg were auctioned is May 1887, but the prices were very low because the soil was marshy. The result was that white working-class families settled in Jeppestown and in Fordsburg factories, bars and &quot;kafir-eating houses&quot; sprang up.

Just north of Jeppestown is Doornfontein, then known as a &#x27;classy&#x27; suburb, where professional and commercial men lived. Many Jews lived there as well. Their children attended school. The first English language school in Johannesburg was started by the Holy Family Sisters. In 1887 they opened a school in Fox Street, but it grew so fast that they had to move to bigger premises in End Street, next to Doornfontein.

To the west of Doornfontein was Braamfontein, where white wage earners with families and single white men lived.

In October 1887 the government of the ZAR bought the south-eastern portion of the farm Braamfontein. Quite a big stream flowed along the farm and they intended selling the water to the residents of Johannesburg. But there were also large quantities of clay, suitable for brickmaking, along the stream. The government decided that more money was to be made from issuing brick maker&#x27;s licences at five shillings per month. The result was that many landless Dutch-speaking burghers (citizens) of the ZAR settled on the property and started making bricks. They also erected their shacks there. Soon the area was known either as Brickfields or Veldschoendorp. Soon other working poor, &quot;Malays, Coolies and Kaffirs&quot; also settled there. The government, who sought to differentiate the white working class from the black, laid out new suburbs for the Burghers, Indians, Coloureds and Africans, but the whole area simply stayed multiracial.

The railway line and goods yards were just north of these slum areas. On 19 February 1896 there was a great dynamite explosion in the railway goods yard at Braamfontein. 55 tons of dynamite had been left in the blazing sun and was detonated by the impact of a shunting engine. The explosion left a crater 250 feet long, 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep. At least 78 people were killed and 1500 injured. The government made another effort to separate the burghers from the non-whites by allowing them to become tenants in the newer suburb called Vrededorp. The suburbs was opened to white who could acquire the stands on leasehold for a mere two shillings and sixpence a month. Many whites took up the offer and then sublet the stands to Indians for five shillings a month.

On the mines living conditions were harsh and alienating, particularly for the Africans who lived in large compounds. They were placed in bunk houses, which were overcrowded and cold in winter, where food was tedious and not abundant and where pulmonary disease was rife. White miners lived differently, though not in overwhelming comfort.
Meanwhile, at the northern extremity of the town was Parktown, already known for its exclusivity and extreme wealth. Sir Lionel Phillips was the first Randlord to build a mansion in Parktown. &quot;Hohenheim&quot; was built in 1894 and demolished in 1972 to make way for the Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Sunny Side Park was designed by Frank Emley for Hennen Jennings and completed in 1896. Today it is part of the Sunny Side Park Hotel. &quot;The View&quot; was completed in 1897. It was built by Charles Aburrow as the residence of Sir Thomas Cullinan.

===Franchise===
The law of the land provided that every White (European) male who had resided in the Transvaal for five years, could be naturalized and become entitled to vote for a representative in the Volksraad (house of assembly). As more and more foreigners (called Uitlanders) arrived in the country to dig for gold, the government realized as early as 1890 that these Uitlanders could easily gain control of the country. The solution was to create a Second Volksraad. Uitlanders who had been naturalized for two years were granted the right to vote for candidates for the Second Volksraad. The Second Volksraad only had a say in regard to specific matters relating to Johannesburg and the mines. The bills of this body only became law after ratification by the First Volksraad. The residential qualification enabling Uitlanders to vote for the First Volksraad was extended from five to fourteen years and the voting age increased to forty years. Only a small number of Uitlanders took the trouble to register as voters for the Second Volksraad.

Uitlander dissatisfaction persisted. Some of their main complaints were nepotism and corruption of officials. What upset them most was that the prices and quality of essential goods for the mining industry were adversely affected by the government&#x27;s system of concessions. These included the supply of water to Johannesburg, the manufacture and distribution of liquor and dynamite and the construction of railway lines. Then too the republican machinery of state was primarily geared to meeting the needs of a pastoral-agricultural community and it did not have the skills to administer a rapidly growing industrial state. The time was ripe for rebellion. In Johannesburg a Reform Committee was formed, while Cecil John Rhodes, the prime minister of the Cape Colony, arranged for Leander Starr Jameson to invade the republic from the west. The Jameson Raid was a failure and all the culprits were arrested. Rhodes had to resign as prime minister.

Afterwards the British Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, took up the cause of the Uitlanders in their fight for the franchise. He appointed fellow-imperialist, Alfred Milner, as British Commissioner in South Africa. No settlement could be reached and eventually, on 11 October 1899, war broke out between Great Britain and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.

==Second Boer War==

===Up to 31 May 1900===

====Flight====
By May 1899 it began to look as though war was a real possibility. First to leave were the wives and children of middle and upper-class families. By June white miners joined the flight. Shop assistants and others in the urban economy were notified by their employers that their services would not be required after the end of the month. Between May and mid-October nearly 100,000 white people fled the district. Thus, at the onset of war, there were only about 10,000 whites in the city. The task of transporting this number of people — as well as the more than 100,000 non-whites who left — was an enormous one. At first only third-class passengers were consigned to trucks which normally carried coal, livestock or Africans. By the middle of October even first class passengers were quite happy to travel in coal trucks to the coast.

John Sidney Marwick was a civil servant in the employ of the Department of the Secretary for Native Affairs in the colony of Natal. In 1896 he was transferred to Johannesburg and appointed as Native Agent for Zululand. He was only twenty years old. His function was to look after the Zulu men working in the mines on the Witwatersrand. In 1897 alone, 20,615 Zulus from Zululand and Natal had registered at the pass office in Johannesburg. By the end of September 1899 some 5,000 Zulus were stranded in Johannesburg and Marwick obtained permission for them to walk back to Natal. They were to walk to the border at Volksrust, some 150 miles from Johannesburg. The march started on 6 October. On 11 October they reached the town of Standerton, where Marwick learnt that the Boers had delivered an ultimatum to the British and it would expire at five o&#x27;clock that afternoon. The Boer commandos, numbering some 8,000 men, had been assembling at Sandspruit on the road between Standerton and Volksrust. Marwick rode ahead to see General Joubert at Sandspruit, but found that the Boer forces had advanced to Volksrust. On 12 October the Zulus marched to within three miles of Sandspruit. That night a heavy downpour of rain came on. A large number of natives were suffering severely from exposure. The next day they reached Volksrust. They saluted General Joubert as they marched past him and then crossed the border into Natal. Unfortunately there were no trains available and the Zulus landed up behind some Boer commandos invading Natal. Marwick and his Zulus were eventually allowed through and they reached Newcastle on 14 October 1899, when the long march home ended. Some walked to Zululand, while others boarded trains for Durban.

====Closing of mines====
On 4 September 1899 the state attorney, Jan Smuts, wrote to the government that the mines would be of the utmost importance in the event of war. They would be a vital source of money if they could be kept open. To guarantee their operation, supplies of material and men had to be maintained and this, in turn, meant that whole staffs, even if British, had to be encouraged to stay. The government responded by reintroducing the Gold Law (Law 15 of 1898). It provided that after martial law had been declared, if a mine ceased operations, the government could order it to reopen and, if it did not comply, it could take over the operation itself. The government would then be entitled to use any gold thus won for its own benefit. The government would be obliged to return the mine to its owner upon repeal of martial law, provided that the owners had not been found guilty of high treason.

Over the weekend of 30 September many of the well-known mines closed, including Simmer &amp; Jack, Wolhuter, Geldenhuis Deep, Henry Nourse and Ferreira. Robinson Deep closed on 3 October. By that time all the Consolidated Gold Fields mines had closed. On 7 October the government listed 66 major mines closed, with only 17 having applied to continue operations. Some mines offered bonuses to white workers if they remained. Some of the discharged Africans started rioting and looting. Thus blacks from Robinson Deep looted Chinese shops at Ophirton. On 8 October, at a &#x27;puza&#x27; shop in the location near Vrededorp, shots were fired and shops looted.
Some of the foreigners were arrested and charged with treason, like the jingoist editor of the Transvaal Leader R.J.Pakeman. Others joined the Boer forces, like John Y.F. Blake, an Irish-American, who commanded the First Irish Brigade. The Scandinavian corps, renowned for their bravery, was virtually wiped out at the battle of Magersfontein. Viscount Villebois-Mareuil formed a small French force.

====Joburg under the Boers====
In late September the government appointed a Rust en Orde (Peace and Order) commission. It consisted of D.E. Schutte (the peacetime commissioner of police), Dr F.E.T. Krause (the head public prosecutor) J.L.van der Merwe (the mining commissioner) and N.P.van den Berg (the head landdrost [magistrate]). A new police force was established for the whole Witwatersrand. Its leader was Captain de Korte, a former officer in the Dutch army. Johannesburg was relatively unaffected by the first eight months of the war. There were of course disrupted services, shortages and a certain amount of fear, tension and boredom.

By mid-October the government had taken over and begun to work three mines: the Robinson, the Bonanza and the Ferreira Deep. J.H.Munnik, the acting state mining engineer, was appointed manager of the Robinson mine. In November they added the Rose Deep as well. Several other mines were allowed to operate under their own management. These were Ferreira, Village Main Reef, the Wemmer, the Johannesburg Pioneer and the Worcester. Later Langlaagte Deep, Crown Deep, Geldenhuis Estate were added. It is thought that between 12,000 and 13,000 blacks remained on the mines. From 10 October to 30 April 1900 gold valued at an estimated £1,710,549 was won from the mines. In May another £240,000 was taken. Working expenses were put at about £630,000 of which only two-thirds was paid. The profit accruing to the government was £1,5 million, enough to cover war expenses up to that point in time.

Also of use to the Boers was Begbie&#x27;s armaments factory. Thomas Begbie &amp; Company, a foundry situated near the City and Suburban mine just south of Johannesburg, was commandeered by the government two days after the war had begun. On 24 April 1900 there was a huge explosion at Begbie&#x27;s factory. The critical question facing the authorities was whether it was an accident or sabotage. Several arrests were made, the suspicion being that it was the work of British agents, but nothing was proved. The carelessness of men filling shells or smoking cigarettes nearby, could not be excluded. As a result of the explosion Schutte was removed as special commandant of the Witwatersrand and Dr Krause was appointed in his stead.

On 3 May 1900 Lord Roberts left Bloemfontein and resumed his march to Pretoria. In the Transvaal there was much talk about a conspiracy to destroy the gold mines before the British arrived. Munnik, the state mining engineer, and ex-judge Antonie Kock were certainly involved. British military intelligence thought Jan Smuts and F.W. Reitz were also involved. In mid-May Kock, at the head of a commando, arrived in Johannesburg with a letter from Reitz instructing him to destroy the mines. Krause refused him access to any mines. On 29 May Krause arrested Kock and had him sent to Pretoria.
Lord Roberts crossed the Vaal River on 29 May and reached Germiston on 30 May. On that morning his representatives entered the town to demand its surrender. Krause agreed to hand the town over the next day. On 31 May the British troops marched into Johannesburg. In front of the court house the Vierkleur was taken down and the Union Jack raised. The new military commissioner of police, Major Francis Davis, imposed a night curfew and closed all liquor stores. The British then had to figure out how to govern the Rand and its population of 13,000 blacks and an unknown number of whites who were probably hostile.

=== After 31 May 1900 ===
One of the first steps taken by Lord Roberts was to declare an Imperial Government Municipality for Johannesburg. Colonel Colin MacKenzie was an appointed as its Military Governor. He had to deal with thousands of previous employees wanting to return to the Rand. On 25 October 1900 the Transvaal was annexed. Lord Alfred Milner was appointed Administrator of the Transvaal in May 1901. He issued the Municipal Proclamation No.16 of 1901 whereby the town was granted a municipal council of 18 members, all nominated. In December 1903 they were replaced by a wholly elected town council consisting of 30 councilors. Municipal boundaries were extended to embrace, within a six-mile radius of the central area, mining properties and all vacant land of which the suburbs of the town were likely to develop. Proclamation 13 of 1902 extended the boundaries of the town&#x27;s jurisdiction to 79 square miles.

Very little is known about the British concentration camp in Turffontein Johannesburg. It was apparently constructed on the site of the Turffontein Turf Club, which was started in 1887 and still exists at the same place. Those who died at the concentration camp were buried at a cemetery where the suburb Suideroord was laid out many years later. The location is 26°16.357&#x27;S, 28°01.638&#x27;E. The site still exists, but it is surrounded by palisade fencing and the gates are securely locked. The cemetery was vandalized at the beginning of the Second World War, with the result that the gravestones were replaced by a memorial. The memorial is in the shape of seven coffins. One marble slab, erected on 10 October 1957, records that it replaced a marble slab that had also been vandalized in March 1957. Another records that 716 persons who had died in the concentration camp, were buried in that cemetery.

In 1902 Lord Milner also issued a proclamation establishing two supreme courts in the Transvaal. The one intended to serve the Witwatersrand gold fields was initially called the Witwatersrand District Court. Later it was called the Transvaal High Court. Although the opening of the court was anticipated for 20 May 1902, the High Court building was only inaugurated in 1910. The stained glass window above the court entrance contains the only remaining coat of arms of the Transvaal Colony. The court is situated in Pritchard Street, opposite Kruis Street. After Union in 1910, the court was called the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. At present (2016) it is called the High Court of South Africa - Gauteng Local Division, Johannesburg.

==The Colonial Transvaal==

In April 1904 there was a bubonic plague scare in the shanty town area of Brickfields. The town council decided to condemn the area and burn it down. Beforehand most of the Africans living there were moved far out of town to Klipspruit (later called Pimville), where the council had erected iron barracks and a few triangular hutments. The rest of them had to build their own shacks. No provision was made for the alternative accommodation of other racial groups. The fire brigade then set the 1600 shacks and shop, plus an Indian temple, in Brickfields alight. Out of this holocaust there emerged one rat that was promptly shot. Thereafter the area was redeveloped as Newtown where a new market was built.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a qualified English barrister, came to southern Africa in 1893 to act as legal representative of some Indian traders in Pretoria. He moved to Natal, where he was instrumental in forming the Natal Indian Congress. In 1902 he concerned himself with the rights of Indians in the Transvaal Colony. He opened his own firm of attorneys (solicitors) in Johannesburg. In 1910 his supporters gave him the use of land to open an ashram, named Tolstoy Farm and dedicated to the ideas of the Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, outside Johannesburg, which was to become the centre of the next phase of satyagraha (nonviolent resistance). In 1913 Gandhi and 2,000 Indian men and women flouted the law and marched from Natal into the Transvaal. He was arrested and jailed. Eventually he reached agreement with General Smuts, resulting in the South African Parliament passing the Indian Relief Act of 1914. He regarded his work in South Africa as done and returned to India in 1915. He acquired the honorific title Mahatma.

Sophiatown was originally part of the farm Waterval. In 1897 the speculator Hermann Tobiansky acquired a 237-acre portion of the farm, which was situated about four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg. In 1903 he had some of the land surveyed as leasehold township, divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky&#x27;s wife, Sophia, and some of the streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Blacks started acquiring land in Sophiatown.
All the gold mines reopened and the Randlords returned to Johannesburg. The first mansion to be built was not in Parktown, but on the hill overlooking Doornfontein suburb. It was called &quot;Eastington&quot; and was built in 1902 for John Dowell Ellis. Soon they started building their Parktown mansions as well. One of the first to be built was &quot;Northwards&quot;. It was designed by Herbert Baker and built at 21 Rockridge Road for Sir John and Lady Josie Dale Lace. When they fell on hard times it was taken over by George Albu. The present owner is the University of the Witwatersrand. The house was built by specialist craftsmen and masons rather than from manufactured parts which had become popular during the Industrial Revolution. The house possesses some beautiful romantic features like a minstrel gallery and Juliette balconies.

Crown Mines Limited, which was founded in 1909 by the combination of seven mining properties, including the Robinson Mine and the Crown Mine, was for many years the biggest producer of gold in the world. It continued mining until 1977.

The Rand Club of Johannesburg is the oldest private members&#x27; club in Johannesburg, South Africa, and founded in October 1887. The plan for the current, third, clubhouse was put on paper in 1902 and its construction was finished in 1904 on the design by architects Leck &amp; Emley in the Edwardian neo-baroque style.

Lord Alfred Milner left South Africa on 2 April 1905 and was succeeded as High Commissioner by the Earl of Selbourne. In January 1906 the Liberal Party in the United Kingdom won the general election and decided to grant the Transvaal responsible government. An election was held in 1907 and General Louis Botha became the Prime Minister of the Transvaal.

The various religious organisations were also building their houses of worship. The synagogue was in President street, while the Baptist Church building was in Plein Street. The Central Congregational Church was in Bree Street.

 The Standard Bank building at the corner of Harrison and Commissioner Streets was completed in 1908. It was built in the Beaux Arts Style, then popular in fashionable areas of London.

Among the public amenities provided by the town council in the first decade was the Ellis Park swimming pool, which opened in 1909.

The population of Johannesburg increased from 13,027 whites and 78,106 non-whites in 1904 to 24,708 whites and 189,912 non-whites in 1910. In the same period the value of gold produced increased from £15 million to £33 million.

In 1909 a National Convention was attended by the four self-governing British colonies in South Africa, namely Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Transvaal and Orange River, to consider closer cooperation. The result was that the British Parliament passed the South Africa Act, 1909 and the said colonies became the Union of South Africa with effect from 31 May 1910.

==Union of South Africa==

===Pre-1948===

====1910 to 1919====

The constitution of the Union of South Africa provided for a highly centralized Westminster-type union, modified by subservient provincial councils with limited powers. One of the powers delegated to provincial councils was control of municipal affairs. In 1912 the Transvaal Provincial Council approved a number of ordinances to control local government institutions in the province. These included the Local Government Ordinance (no. 9 of 1912), the Local Authorities Rating Ordinance (no. 6 of 1912) and the Municipal Elections Ordinance (no. 8 of 1912).

There was a portion of the quitrent farm &quot;Cyferfontien&quot; No. 2 in the District of Johannesburg, transferred to Gert Pieter Johannes Labuschagne by deed dated 31 March 1875. In 1905 the portion known as Alexandra was transferred to Alexandra Township Ltd., the name &quot;Alexandra&quot; being that of King Edward VII&#x27;s wife. On the property a township was laid out consisting of 388 lots, 2 parks and a square, in addition to streets. It was intended for occupation by white persons, but the lots were not sold and in 1912 the township company decided that properties in the township, to use the elegant language of the deed of transfer, &quot;shall not be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of excepting to a native or person of colour, provided that an Asiatic shall not be included in the terms &#x27;native or person of colour&#x27;.&quot; Although ordinarily an African could not purchase land outside certain scheduled areas, this prohibition did not apply in regard to a township established prior to the commencement of Act No 27 of 1913, and it was therefore lawful for Alexandra Township Ltd to sell lots to black persons. And thus black persons acquired the precious right of freehold title to land when they purchased lots in Alexandra Township. There were 2525 lots, nearly all of which had been sold in 1936 when the population in the area was about 16753.

While a limited amount working-class housing existed within Johannesburg, the number of workers wanting to live in the city far exceeded the housing that was available and actually preferred the more expensive slum-yards than the workers&#x27; compounds. Segregationist laws like the Natives&#x27; Land Act of 1913, which defined less than 10% of South Africa as black &quot;reserves&quot; and prohibited the sale or lease of land to blacks outside of the reserves, sought to restrict Africans from access to cities and effectively prevented Africans from land ownership throughout the country. However, the labor needs of Johannesburg&#x27;s growing manufacturing sector, especially in the wake of World War I, when increased industrialization also increased the need for African labor, meant that the Johannesburg municipal government ignored national policy and allowed racial mixing in these growing urban slums to occur. A municipal system of exemption certificates obtained through employers did exist to grant African workers the right to live in urban areas. However, disregard on the part of the employer&#x27;s for filling out the paperwork meant that most Africans resided in the city illegally.
Johannesburg City Hall was constructed in 1914 by the Hawkey and McKinley construction company. The plan for the building was drawn in 1910 and construction was started in 1913 and finished in 1914. The style is described as Edwardian Baroque with a portico of Ionic columns and tower with a half dome entrance described as neo-Renaissance. Florence Phillips, an art collector and the wife of mining magnate Lionel Phillips, established the first collection for the Johannesburg Art Gallery using funds donated by her husband. The architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, came to South Africa in 1910 to examine the site and begin the designs, after Lady Florence Phillips had secured funding from the city for a purpose-built museum. The gallery was possibly Luytens&#x27;s first public building in the Beaux Arts style. It was built with a south-facing entrance, but was not completed according to the architect&#x27;s designs. It was opened to the public, without ceremony, in 1915, just after the start of the First World War.

In 1919 the municipality laid out another native location next to the Sophiatown township. It was called Western Native Township and was owned and controlled by the municipality.

====1920 to 1929====
At the end of 1921 the miners of the Witwatersrand went on strike. At one stage they occupied the Johannesburg suburbs of Fordsburg and Jeppe. The uprising was also known as the Rand Revolt.
On 1 March 1922, the University College, Johannesburg, was finally granted full university status after being incorporated as the University of the Witwatersrand. The Johannesburg municipality donated a site in Milner Park, north-west of Braamfontein, to the new institution as its campus and construction began the same year, on 4 October. In 1925, the Prince of Wales opened Central Block (which includes the Great Hall).

The Rand Water Board Supplementary Water Supply (Private) Act was passed by the Union Parliament in June 1914. The measure gave the Board the right to impound annually sufficient of the Vaal River&#x27;s surplus water to supply the Witwatersrand with 20 million gallons a day. A loan of £1,250,000 was raised for the construction of the barrage below Vereeniging. It was only completed in 1923.

In 1926 the Transvaal Provincial Council repealed the Local Government Ordinance of 1912 and passed the new Local Government Ordinance, No. 11 of 1926.

The Transvaal Provincial Council adopted a Private Ordinance (No. 15 of 1928) in terms of which the Town of Johannesburg acquired the designation of the City of Johannesburg. The Town Council became known as the City Council of Johannesburg.

In 1923 the Parliament of the Union of South Africa passed the Natives (Urban Areas) Act. This Act required local authorities to provide accommodation for Natives (then the polite term for Africans or Blacks) lawfully employed and resident within the area of their jurisdiction. Pursuant to this Act the Johannesburg town council formed a Municipal Native Affairs Department in 1927.It bought a large tract on the farm Klipspruit No. 8 and the first houses in what was to become Orlando Location were built there in the latter half of 1930.

====1930 to 1939====
In 1935 the Johannesburg City Library eventually opened its doors to the public.

The Ansteys Building at the corner of Jeppe and Joubert Streets was designed by Emley and William and completed in 1937. It is recognised as a prime example of Art Deco Architecture, a style synonymous with modernisation, optimism and Americanisation before World War 2. The departmental store, N. Anstey&#x27;s and Company, occupied the first four floors of the building. The tea terrace was on the fourth floor and was a destination of choice for the ladies of the northern suburbs. The building is 20 storeys high and was, when it was completed, the highest building in the southern hemisphere. The remaining storeys were offices and apartments, some of them occupying an entire floor. The building terminates in a mast designed for docking air ships.

In 1939 the Transvaal Provincial Council once again passed a brand new ordinance to control local governments in the Transvaal. It was called the Local Government Ordinance, 1939.

====1940 to 1948====

In 1940 London asked Pretoria to provide hospitals for Imperial troops stationed in the Middle East. South African agreed to build one such hospital on the road between Johannesburg and Potchefstroom. The exact place was to be at the 8th milestone near the old Wayside Inn, owned by a Cornishman called John Albert Baragwanath. Construction started in November 1941 and within 6 months the first soldiers could be admitted in May 1942. Britain paid £328,000 for the 1,544-bed hospital. The facility was called the Imperial Military Hospital, Baragwanath. Towards the end of the war more and more tuberculosis patients were treated, some also coming from Burma. Those who died were buried at the new Westpark Cemetery near Emmarentia. King George VI visited the facility on 5 April 1947 and presented medals to some of the troops who were still patients there. Later, the Transvaal Provincial Administration bought the hospital for £1 million. On 1 April 1948 the Black section of Johannesburg Hospital (known as Non-European Hospital or NEH) was transferred to Baragwanath Hospital.

From 1944 many more Natives started arriving in Johannesburg. Soon they started spilling out of Pimville and other parts of the western and eastern areas of Johannesburg, soon congregating on a site to the west of Orlando. At the beginning of 1947 the City Council started a new emergency camp called Moroko. They made 10,000 small sites available. Residents were expected to build their own makeshift shanties on cramped six metre by six metre plots and using communal bucket-system toilets. The emergency camp was only dismantled in 1955, when it housed 58,000 people.

===1948 to 1961===
In 1948 the National Party won the general election and this was set to change the face of South African history for ever. The support the National Party gained from the electorate was largely the result of white fears regarding the rapid urbanisation of blacks after the Second World War. The Nats campaigned vigorously for racially segregated cities under a policy they called &quot;apartheid&quot;. They imposed stricter pass laws which made it more difficult for black workers to travel to town, cleared black freehold townships and other areas of black settlement in the inner city and built 7,000 new houses in Johannesburg. By 1956 the Johannesburg City Council had provided 26,134 black families with houses in the seven townships under its control. These were Orlando (14356 houses), Western Native Township (2,250), Eastern Native Township (617), Pimville (1,246), Jabavu (5,100), Dube (1,115) and Mofolo (1,450). But the housing backlog had climbed to 57,000.

The logjam was soon broken. The central government decided to rather let land to Africans so that they could erect their own houses on the Moroka Emergency Camp. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research designed a standard house for low cost housing. It was a 40-square-metre four roomed house. Then in 1951 it passed the Bantu Building Workers Act, permitting Blacks to be trained as artisans in the building industry. It also passed the Bantu Services Levy Act in 1952, which imposed a levy on the employers of Africans and used the proceeds to pay for infrastructure in their townships. The Johannesburg City Council provided 10,000 serviced sites by the end of 1955. The next year the townships of Tladi, Zondi, Dhlamini, Chiawelo and Senoane were laid out to provide 28,888 people with accommodation. In 1957 Jabulani, Phiri and Naledi followed. By 1958 Moroka and all shelters in Orlando had been cleared. But formal housing was lagging behind and by 1954 only 3,000 had been provided. Then Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was invited to visit Moroka. Sir Ernest was aghast and he arranged with other mining companies to join Anglo-American in providing the city with a loan of £3 million to be repaid over thirty years. Between 1954 and 1959 24,000 additional houses were built and 14,000 of them were financed by these loans.

The first Group Areas Act was promulgated on 7 July 1950, and it was implemented over a period of several years. The Act empowered the Governor-General to declare certain geographical areas to be for the exclusive occupation of specific racial groups. In particular the statute identified three such racial groups: whites, coloureds and natives. The Act permitted the removal of person from an area reserved for persons of a different racial group. This Act was repealed and re-enacted in consolidated form as the Group Areas Act, 1957. The townships of Meadowlands and Diepkloof were built by the central government. Between 1956 and the early 1960s 23,995 houses were built, particularly for those Blacks evicted from Sophiatown, Martindale, Newclare and Western Native Township in terms of the Group Areas Act. The Johannesburg City Council (controlled by the opposition United Party) would have nothing to do with the forced removals. So it was done by the government&#x27;s Natives Resettlement Board. Subsequently, the Board administered those two townships.

Before 1948 the township of Dube was set aside as an area where wealthier Africans could obtain freehold title and build their own houses. The National Party put a stop to this and changed it to 30-year leaseholds. By 1954 African residents had built 2,500 houses from their own resources. The top-of-the-range houses cost around £1,500 compared to the £250 of the &quot;matchbox&quot; houses in other townships.

In 1959 Mr. Carr, the city council&#x27;s manager of Non-European Affairs, launched a competition to find a new name for the council&#x27;s showpiece of slum clearance. He offered a prize of £10. After four years of hot arguments the naming committee decided to call it Soweto, an abbreviated version of South-Western Townships.

The 1957 Alexandra bus boycott was a protest undertaken against the Public Utility Transport Corporation (PUTCO) by the people of Alexandra. The bus boycott lasted from January 1957 to June 1957. At its height, 70,000 township residents refused to ride the local buses to and from work. For many people this daily journey to downtown Johannesburg was a twenty-mile round trip.

In the 1950s the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) decided to move its headquarters from the centre of town to Braamfontein. ESCOM acquired a whole block fronting on Smit, Harrison, Loveday and Wolmarans Streets, a site formerly occupied by a dairy. The cost of the site was £261 220 and the building cost was £1 854 620. The building was completed in 1958 and was 17 storeys high. It was called Eskom Centre.

Randburg was founded in 1959 as a new municipality of 32 suburbs northwest of Johannesburg. Although economically linked to Johannesburg, residents chose to create their own town council. The name Randburg was chosen in a competition, and is derived from the South African Rand currency, which was introduced at around the same time that the new municipality was established. Randburg was a stronghold of the National Party during the apartheid era.

On 31 May 1961 the Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa.

==Republic of South Africa==

===1961 to 1969===

The Albert Hertzog Tower in Brixton Johannesburg was completed in 1962. It is high concrete radio and (now) television tower. The first transmission took place on 22 December 1961. Presently 18 FM programs and 7 TV stations are broadcast from there. When Albert Hertzog fell into disfavour with the government, it was called the Brixton Tower. At present it is called the Sentech Tower.

In 1964 the Johannesburg Botanical Garden was established in the suburb of Emmarentia. The Emmarentia Dam forms part of the Garden. The Garden is best known for its roses.

The Rand Afrikaans University was founded in 1966. Its first campus was on the erstwhile premises of South African Breweries in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Later it moved to its new campus in Auckland Park. The University of Johannesburg came into existence on 1 January 2005 as the result of a merger between the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), the Technikon Witwatersrand (TWR) and the Soweto and East Rand campuses of Vista University.

===1970 to 1979===

The Standard Bank Centre is in Fox and Simmond Streets in central Johannesburg. During the excavation, three stories below ground level, they came across an old stope. It was part of the workings of the old Ferreira Mine. The building&#x27;s foundations were stabilised by backfilling the No. 1 level of the workings with concrete grout, but part of the stope was preserved as a museum. The building was completed in 1970. It was constructed by first building a central core and cantilever arms and then suspending the floors from the arms. The Centre houses a renowned art gallery.

The enormous Carlton Centre, built at a cost of R88 million, contained a fifty-storey office tower, the thirty-storey luxury Carlton Hotel, a five-storey Garlicks department store, three-and-a-half-acre public plaza with a two-story underground shopping centre beneath it and parking garages with space for 2000 cars. The Carlton Hotel (Johannesburg) opened for business on 1 October 1972.

Ponte City is a skyscraper in the Berea neighbourhood, just next to Hillbrow. It was built in 1975 to a height of , making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa.

In 1971 the South African Broadcasting Corporation was eventually allowed to introduce a television service. When television was finally introduced, there was only one channel with airtime divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, alternating between the two languages. Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on 5 May 1975, followed in July by ones in Cape Town and Durban. Nationwide services finally commenced on 5 January 1976.

In 1971 Parliament passed the Black Affairs Administration Act, No. 45 of 1971. In terms of this Act the central government appointed the West Rand Administration Board to take over the powers and obligations of the Johannesburg City Council in respect of Soweto. As chairman of the board it appointed Manie Mulder, a political appointment of a person who had no experience of the administration of native affairs.

The Soweto Uprising was a series of protests led by high school students in South Africa that began on the morning of 16 June 1976. Students from numerous Sowetan schools began to protest in the streets of Soweto in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in local schools. It is estimated that 20,000 students took part in the protests. The number of protesters killed by police was officially given as 176, but estimates of up to 700 have been made. In remembrance of these events, 16 June is now a public holiday in South Africa. A thirteen year old Black boy, Hector Pieterson, is the iconic first victim of police brutality, but Dr Melville Edelstein, who had devoted his life to social welfare among blacks, was soon forgotten. He was stoned to death by the mob and left with a sign around his neck proclaiming &quot;Beware Afrikaners&quot;.

Following the riots the government founded three community councils, namely Soweto proper, Dobsonville and Diepmeadow (the latter for the townships of Diepkloof and Meadowlands). When elections were held for their councils, only 16% of voters in Diepmeadow and 6% in Soweto went to the polls. In 1978 the government transferred local administrative powers to the three councils, but their decisions had to be ratified by the Minister of Plural Relations. In 1983 the community councils acquired full local government status in terms of the Black Local Authorities Act, No. 102 of 1982

Pursuant to the Group Areas Act, Pageview (previously a part of Vrededorp) was declared a white group area on 27 July 1956. The result was that all &quot;non-whites&quot; became &quot;disqualified persons&quot; in Pageview and were obliged to leave the area. Between 1964 and 1970 all non-white (mainly Indian) residents were issued ejectment orders. Some moved to the new Indian suburb of Lenasia, while others resisted the orders. The government tried to force the removal by closing all the Indian schools in the Pageview area. During the period 1974 to 1981 the government gradually removed all Indians from their homes and shops and dumped them in Lenasia. Bulldozers moved in and demolished most of the structures. One of the structures not demolished, was a shop belonging to the Surtees outfitters. It is now the Fietas Museum.

===1980 to 1989===
Midrand was established as a municipality in 1981 (in an area known as Halfway House, after its position between Pretoria and Johannesburg), but ceased to be an independent town in the restructuring of local government that followed the end of apartheid in 1994. It was incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in 2000.

In 1982 Parliament passed the Black Local Authorities Act, No. 102 of 1982. In terms of this Act the City Council of Soweto came into being.

===1990 to 1994===

==The New South Africa==
The establishment of metropolitan municipalities took a long time. In 1989 the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber came into being to show the way for local government transition across the country. In 1993 the Local Government Transition Act, No. 203 of 1993, recognised the importance of negotiation and formalised the Greater Johannesburg Local Negotiating Forum. The Act provided for a two-tier system of government with strong local councils and a weaker metro tier playing a coordinating role. The first fully democratic local government elections were held in November 1995. It gave birth to a Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and four Transitional Metropolitan Local Councils. Unfortunately this arrangement led to a very serious financial crisis, mainly because the local councils were not obliged to balance their budgets.

In the meantime Chapter 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, dealt with local government. In terms of section 155(1)(a) a category A municipality is one that has exclusive municipal executive and legislative authority in its area. In the Municipal Structures Act (Act 117 of 1998) it is laid down that this type of local government is to be used for conurbations, i.e. &quot;centre[s] of economic activity&quot;, areas &quot;for which integrated development planning is desirable&quot;, and areas with &quot;strong interdependent social and economic linkages&quot;. Johannesburg is such a municipality and these are called Metropolitan Municipalities. Eleven local authorities were to be joined in 2000 to form the new Johannesburg metropolitan municipality. These included Roodepoort, Randburg, Sandton, Johannesburg, Soweto, Diepmeadow, Dobsonville, Lenasia and Midrand.

A completely refurbished Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup final.

From 22 to 24 August 2023, Johannesburg hosted 15th BRICS Summit.

On 31 August 2023, at least 76 people died when a building caught fire in Johannesburg. The building had been taken over by a gang who were illegally renting it out.

<doc id="988875" wikidata="Q7054985" url="?curid=988875" title="North Dakota's at-large congressional district">
<text>North Dakota&#x27;s at-large congressional district is the sole congressional district for the state of North Dakota. Based on size, it is the eighth largest congressional district in the nation.

The district was represented by Kelly Armstrong who served in Congress until December 2024 when he resigned to take office as Governor of North Dakota. The district is currently represented by Republican Julie Fedorchak. 

== History==

The district was first created when North Dakota achieved statehood on November 2, 1889, electing a single member. Following the 1900 United States census the state was allocated two seats, both of whom were elected from an at large district. Following the 1910 United States census a third seat was gained, with the legislature drawing three separate districts. The third district was eliminated after the 1930 United States census. After the third seat was lost, North Dakota returned to electing two members at-large (statewide).

Following the 1960 United States census two separate districts were created. In 1970, the second district was eliminated following the 1970 United States census and a single at-large district was created. Since 1972, North Dakota has retained a single congressional district.

<doc id="988886" wikidata="Q4356264" url="?curid=988886" title="Montana's at-large congressional district">
<text>From 1993 to 2023, Montana was represented in the United States House of Representatives by one at-large congressional district, among the 435 in the United States Congress. The district was the most populous U.S. congressional district at the time, with just over 1 million constituents, and the second-largest by land area, after Alaska&#x27;s at-large congressional district.

The district was last represented by Republican Matt Rosendale. It had previously been represented by Republican Greg Gianforte, who did not seek re-election in 2020. Instead, he opted to run for Governor of Montana.

Starting in the 2022 midterm elections, per the 2020 United States census, Montana regained the congressional seat that it lost after the 1990 census. Thus, the current at-large statewide district was dissolved, and the new districts were the 1st district in the west and the 2nd district in the east, restoring a configuration that had existed from 1919 to 1993. Rosendale sought re-election in the 2nd district and was elected.

==Politics==
President George W. Bush won Montana in the 2004 presidential election with 59.1% of the vote, beating John Kerry by 20 percentage points, which indicates that the district leans Republican. However, four years later John McCain won the state by only 2.5% over Barack Obama, and there is a significant Democratic presence in the state: as of 2021 one U.S. Senate seat is held by a Democrat, which suggested at the time that the district could be competitive in future elections. In 2016, Donald Trump won by over 20%, while Ryan Zinke won Montana&#x27;s single congressional seat by over 16%. Incumbent Democratic Governor Steve Bullock, however, was also reelected by 4%. The seat was left vacant when Zinke was appointed Secretary of the Interior. In a special election held on May 25, 2017, Republican Greg Gianforte won with a margin of 6% and would be reelected by a margin of 5% in 2018.

==Early at-large district==
From statehood in 1889, until the creation of geographic districts in 1919, Montana was represented in the United States House of Representatives by members elected at-large, that is, requiring voting by all the state population. From 1913 to 1919, there were &quot;two&quot; seats, still elected at-large; the top two finishers were awarded the seats. After that time, two representatives were elected from two geographic districts of roughly equal population, from the east and the west of the state. 

In the reapportionment following the 1990 census, Montana lost one of its two seats. Its remaining member was again elected at-large.

== List of members representing the district ==
=== 1889–1919: one, then two seats ===
The two at-large seats were moved to district representation in 1919, and remained until 1993, when Montana lost a seat due to redistricting from the 1990 U.S. census, re-establishing the single seat at-large district.

===1993–2023: one seat===

<text>Alabama State University (ASU, Bama State, or Alabama State) is a public historically black university in Montgomery, Alabama. Founded in 1867, during the Reconstruction era, it was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; established by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. It was one of 23 established to train African Americans to teach in segregated schools. Some of the 180 closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. ASU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

== History ==
Alabama State University was founded in 1867 as the Lincoln Normal School of Marion in Marion. In December 1874, the State Board accepted the transfer of title to the school after a legislative act was passed authorizing the state to fund a Normal School, and George N. Card was named president. Thus, in 1874, this predecessor of Alabama State University became America&#x27;s first state-supported educational institution for blacks. This began ASU&#x27;s history as a &quot;teachers&#x27; college.&quot;

The second president, William Burns Paterson, was appointed in 1878. He is honored as a founder of Alabama State University and was the president for 37 of the school&#x27;s first 48 years. Paterson was instrumental in the move from Marion to Montgomery in 1887.

In 1887, the university opened in its new location in Montgomery, but an Alabama State Supreme Court ruling forced the school to change its name; it was renamed the Normal School for Colored Students. The campus was chosen in 1889 although preparing the buildings at the site took a while longer.

In the decades that followed, Lincoln Normal School became a junior college, and in 1928 became a full four-year institution. In 1929 it became State Teachers College, Alabama State College for Negroes in 1948, and Alabama State College in 1954. In 1969, the State Board of Education, then the governing body of the university, approved a name change; the institution became Alabama State University.

The 1995 Knight vs. Alabama remedial decree transformed ASU into a comprehensive regional institution paving the way for two new undergraduate programs, four new graduate programs, diversity scholarship funding and endowment, funding to build a state-of-the art health sciences facility, and a facility renewal allocation to refurbish three existing buildings.

WVAS-FM was launched on June 15, 1984, beaming 25,000 watts of power from the fifth floor of the Levi Watkins Learning Center for two years before moving to its current location at Thomas Kilby Hall. Today, WVAS has grown to 80,000 watts and has a listenership that spans 18 counties, reaching a total population of more than 651,000. In recent years, the station has also begun streaming its broadcast via the Web, connecting a global audience to the university.

The early 1990s witnessed the beginning of WAPR-FM (Alabama Public Radio), which Alabama State University and Troy University, both of which already held station licenses of their own, cooperated with the University of Alabama in building and operating. WAPR-FM 88.3—Selma&#x27;s signal reaches the region known colloquially as the Black Belt, about 13 counties in the west central and central parts of Alabama, including the city of Montgomery.

In 2021, ASU received a $24.7 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Education to help Montgomery Public Schools students better prepare for a higher education. This is the largest single grant in the history of the institution.

<doc id="988889" wikidata="Q4311018" url="?curid=988889" title="Vermont's at-large congressional district">
<text>Vermont has been represented in the United States House of Representatives by a single at-large congressional district since the 1930 census, when the state lost its second seat, obsoleting its 1st and 2nd congressional districts. There were once six districts in Vermont, all of which were eliminated after various censuses.

Bernie Sanders (Independent) held the seat from 1991 until 2007, when he became a U.S. senator. Democrat Peter Welch, who succeeded Sanders in 2007, represented the state until 2023, when he was elected to succeed Patrick Leahy in the Senate. Progressive Democrat Becca Balint was elected to succeed Welch in the House for the 118th Congress. Balint is the first woman and LGBT person to represent Vermont, making Vermont the last state to be represented in Congress by a woman.
== List of members representing the district ==
Vermont has elected its representatives at-large from 1813 to 1821, beginning with the 13th Congress; 1823 to 1825, with the 18th Congress; and from 1933 to the present, beginning with the 73rd Congress, after being reduced to one representative as a result of the 1930 census. In all other years, Vermont elected its representatives from separate districts.

All members were elected statewide at-large on a general ticket.

===2006===

Incumbent Bernie Sanders retired to successfully run for a U.S. Senate seat.

Vermont Senate President &quot;Pro Tempore&quot; Peter Welch (D-Windsor County) was the Democratic nominee and the eventual winner.

Three candidates competed for the Republican nomination:
*Retired Major General Martha Rainville, former Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard.
*Vermont State senator Mark Shepard of Bennington County.
*Businessman Dennis Morrisseau, who promised to bring articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush.

Rainville won the Republican primary on September 12, beating Shepard by a wide margin.

There were also numerous third party and independent candidates: Chris Karr (WTP), Bruce Marshall (Green Party), Dennis Morrisseau (Ind), Jane Newton (Liberty Union Party), Keith Stern (Ind), and Jerry Trudell (Ind). Morrisseau gathered the most votes, with 1% or 1,383 votes.

By September 14, 2006, the race between Rainville and Welch was close. An American Research Group poll showed Welch with a 48–45% lead.

On October 4, 2006, &quot;The Burlington Free Press&quot; reported that one of Rainville&#x27;s staffers, Christopher Stewart, resigned from her campaign after committing plagiarism—copying policy statements from other politicians, including senator Hillary Clinton, and using them on Rainville&#x27;s website. Rainville&#x27;s website was off-line for some time while her staff removed the plagiarized passages.

Welch beat Rainville 53% to 45%, or 139,585 votes to 117,211.

<text>Ace Ventura is a title character created by screenwriter Jack Bernstein. Ace was performed by Jim Carrey in the films &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, released in 1994, and &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;, released in 1995, and was voiced by Michael Daingerfield in the &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; television series.

==Biography==
Ace is a Miami-based private detective specializing in the retrieval of missing animals, the son of Rex Ventura and descendant of such as &quot;Ernest Ventura Shackleton&quot; and &quot;Jacques Ventura Costeau&quot;. It is not known whether the animated television series was contiguous with the feature films, but if it was it may take place before them because the only one of his pets to appear in the series is his capuchin monkey, Spike. His eccentricities make him a laughing stock to the Miami-Dade Police Department in the early part of the first film, but he eventually earned their respect after his rescue of quarterback Dan Marino and the dolphin, Snowflake, the mascot of the Miami Dolphins.

===&quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;===

During the first film, Ace lives in an apartment alongside many different animals, all of whom hide from his landlord (to whom he owes money for rent), Mr. Shickadance (Mark Margolis) in his absence. He is tasked with not only finding a stolen dolphin, but also trying to prevent the kidnapping of Dan Marino from a psychopath ex-football player, Ray Finkle, bent on revenge for costing the Dolphins the game with the botched field goal against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX. He is certain that Finkle is the man responsible, but he can&#x27;t find Finkle. Ace also learns of a missing hiker who coincidentally is named Lois Einhorn, who is a lieutenant of the Miami Police department and tries to figure out the connection she has with his suspect. Eventually, Ace not only discovers the connection that Finkle has with Einhorn, but also that they&#x27;re the same person in disguise. As the real Lois Einhorn was still missing, Finkle had used the opportunity to steal her identity by having a sex-change and then joined the police force as part of his plan for revenge. Disgusted by the thought that when he had been previously kissed by Einhorn, he had actually been kissed by a man, Ace spends the night rinsing his mouth out and washing himself. Following Einhorn to the hideout inside a wharf, he tries to test his theory on her, but finds a normal feminine body and actual hair. Before Ace was about to give up, Marino secretly alerts him to a bulge sticking between her legs. With concrete proof, Ace makes a short humiliating speech at Einhorn while revealing to the entire Miami PD about her true motive in killing Roger Podacter, when he discovered her true identity as Ray Finkle (&quot;He found Captain Winky&quot;). He proves it by forcibly turning Einhorn over to reveal the bulge sticking out of her silk panties. Marino, Snowflake and the rest of the cops, react in disgust when they learn that Finkle had kissed them the same way as Ace was kissed. Now exposed and humiliated, enraged Finkle makes his last attempt to kill Ace out of revenge, but he flips him over into the wharf. As he attempts to pull himself up, Ace steps over Finkle&#x27;s hand and takes the ring which was indeed a missing stone to finalize his theory by proving that Lois Einhorn is the disgraced Ray Finkle. Ace begins a relationship with Miami Dolphins&#x27; press officer, Melissa Robinson, while Lois Einhorn a.k.a Ray Finkle is arrested.

===&quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;===

During the second film, Ace attempts monasticism after a failed rescue attempt of a raccoon, only to be called out of retirement to investigate a missing sacred animal named Shikaka, although he has a severe fear of bats. During meditation with the Abbot, he discovers Vincent Cadby who originally hired him to find the bat is the same kidnapper who wanted the war to happen so he can take control of the guano deposits there. His motive for hiring Ace was to have an alibi, that he tried to prevent the war. He thwarts Cadby&#x27;s plans to have the two tribes go to war and returns the sacred bat. After the marriage between the Wachati chief&#x27;s daughter and Tiny Warrior, Ace is eventually hunted down by both tribes, implying he had something to do with the princess no longer being a virgin.

==Family and Ace Irwin Ventura Jr.==
By the events portrayed in &quot;Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective&quot;, it is established that after resolving his case in Africa, Ace returned to Miami and started a family. He married Melissa and they had a son, Jr., but Ace has disappeared somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, and never appears in the film itself. However, Ace Jr. inherited his ability to discern trouble, which he must rely on when he must assist in finding his classmates&#x27; pets along with the missing animals and clear his mother&#x27;s name when she is accused of the theft. Ace Jr. believes her innocence and seeks the help of his grandfather, Rex, to help him investigate the whole thing. They begin to suspect that one of his classmates was involved in the theft and with the help of A-Plus, Ace Jr. suspects that Pennington Jr. had been involved with Dr. Sickenger (who is insane). Sickenger is found to be innocent and he helps lead Ace Jr. along with Rex to the true culprit, Quinton Pennington Sr. After finding the animals in the Pennington family home, Pennington Sr. confesses to his crime, admitting that he stole the pets along with the famous animals because he was trying to keep his son happy. He eventually got fed up with his spoiled nature when he refused to be satisfied. Melissa is cleared of the theft charges and Pennington Sr. is arrested for his crimes. Ace Jr. is rewarded as a hero for his efforts.

==Personality==
Ace Ventura is an eccentric self-styled &quot;pet detective&quot; who forsook regular police work to concentrate on this latter pursuit. Like other fictional detectives, he is notable for extraordinary powers of observation and deduction: he also possesses the ability to &quot;understand&quot; animals, and on at least one occasion, he has managed to escape being shot by catching a bullet in his teeth and is shown to be a capable hand to hand fighter.

Ventura&#x27;s eccentricities include his persistent rudeness, coupled with his exceedingly flamboyant behavior including pronouncing the word loser as &quot;loo-hoo-sa-her&quot; as a form of disrespect; despite this, he is a dedicated detective, driven by an insatiable adoration of animals and a desire to protect them from human mistreatment. In &quot;Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective&quot;, it is implied that his abilities, personality, and appearance are hereditary. Although Ace is an animal lover, &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; reveals that he has a deep-seated fear of bats.
In most appearances, Ace usually wears an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt over a plain white A-shirt, with red and black, blue, or pink and purple striped pants and black combat boots.

== Crossover with &quot;The Mask&quot;==
In the episode &quot;The Aceman Cometh&quot; of &quot;The Mask: Animated Series&quot;, when Milo, the pet dog of Stanley Ipkiss, was stolen by Dr. Pretorius, Ipkiss calls Ace for help. Both Ipkiss/the Mask and Ace Ventura were the animated versions of characters portrayed by Jim Carrey himself. The crossover continued in the &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; episode &quot;Have Mask, Will Travel&quot;, in which Ace accidentally wears the mask on his buttocks, which assumes a face similar to his own and gains the ability to speak, suggesting a joke featured in &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; of speaking while presenting his rump to Emilio and moving it akin to a speaking mouth.

== Reception ==
Ace was ranked the 60th Greatest Movie Character in a November 2008 list by &quot;Empire&quot;. Despite his popularity, he was also voted one of the most annoying film characters ever in a British online poll.

<doc id="988897" wikidata="Q6942110" url="?curid=988897" title="Music of Guyana">
<text>The music of [[Guyana]] www.visualpiano.net encompasses a range of musical styles and genres that draw from various influences including: Indian, Latino-Hispanic, European, African, Chinese, and Amerindian music. Popular Guyanese performers include: Terry Gajraj, Eddy Grant, Dave Martins &amp; the Tradewinds (Johnny Braff, Ivor Lynch &amp; Sammy Baksh), Aubrey Cummings, Collé Kharis and Nicky Porter. Eddie Hooper The Guyana Music Festival has proven to be influential on the Guyana music scene.

== History ==
Earliest recorded musical interactions were mainly related to the missionary-driven spread of Christianity in the New World. Moravian missionaries used music used hymns to reach the Kalina people in the area of Berbice. Slaves brought to the region via the Atlantic slave trade contributed African influences from a wide array of different cultures, although music and dance was also utilized to promote fitness in slaves by their sellers. After emancipation, the period in which the British sought to bring indentured labor into the colonies introduced musical traditions of India, as well as Portugal and other countries.

When the colonies of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice were merged into British Guiana, colonial power and upper class culture &quot;exerted substantial influence&quot; over music styles of the time. Military bands for parades and ceremonial purpose reflected British sovereignty. Classical music, religious music, or folk songs of Britain were also popular among the ruling class. In the late19th century, there was &quot;a tendency import artists&quot; as a show of &quot;Victorian culture of respectability&quot;.

In marginalized groups, laws were enacted to suppress music, as it was connected to revolts. Nonetheless, music reflecting other cultures flourished within communities such as African-derived music in villages of former slaves and Indian traditions maintained in villages occupied by those under and post-indenture. The British Guiana Militia Band, formed mainly to deal with the unpopularity stemmed from involvement in the Angel Gabriel Riots, served both functions of promoting British Imperialism as well as an apprenticeship program for musicians of the Portuguese Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese working class. Other musical events of the working-class included &quot;practices&quot;, a paid-entry dance hall. Genres reflected a mix of African, Irish, and Scottish music traditions and instruments.

Contrary to the Christian-derived music of the colonial elite, bhajans were important to Indo-Guyanese music. Tan singing and folk music accompanied by tassa drums followed instruments such as the harmonium, sitar, tabla, dholak and dhantal. Hindi has given way to English and Caribbean creole languages giving rise to fusion styles such as chutney, which flourished mostly in Trinidad and Tobago during its early years as Guyanese media outlets greatly restrained Indian culture in the 1970s and 80s. In the 90s, just as calypso was developing into Soca, chutney also took on more regional influences such as using the steelpan and electronic instruments.

Calypso music, common among Afro-Caribbean communities, has also been an outlet for criticizing the government or addressing other social issues. Guyana has annual calypso competitions.

==Music education==
Guyana is home to many unique music traditions, but music has tended to receive little support in schools. Music studies are offered as part of teacher training at Cyril Potter College of Education, and a fledgling National School of Music was opened in 2012.

==Prominent musicians==
El Sadiek &amp; De Sugar Cake Girls from Guyana was a unique formation of entertainers, singers, dancers, musicians including the Sugar Cake Girls - Fiona, Sarah and Kamla. The diversity of El Sadiek music repertoire of Filmi, Chutney, Soca, Reggae, Hip Hop, and Soul music. El Sadiek lead keyboard player, Shabana, is the only female Indian keyboard player in Guyana and perhaps the Caribbean. El Sadiek also includes the singer Kerida who Chutney and Filmi beats. Other talented lead singers were Sheik and Dj Poopsie.

Guyanese-born musicians who developed their musical careers abroad include Mad Professor (Neil Fraser). Fraser created Ariwa Records in 1979 and became a central figure in the UK dub scene as a prolific producer of dub and an originator of the &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; genre in the early 1980s.

Rapper Central Cee is of British-Guyanese descent.

He was mayor of Ypsilanti in 1880 and was appointed United States Indian agent for Michigan in August 1882, serving until December 1885.

Allen lost his first election for the United States House of Representatives in 1884. In 1886, Allen was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1887, to March 3, 1891. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1890 to the Fifty-second Congress.

==Last years==
After leaving Congress, Allen resumed the practice of law and was a member of the State board of agriculture 1897-1903 and was again mayor of Ypsilanti in 1899 and 1900. He was a member of the State soldiers’ home board 1903–1909. Allen died from a stroke in Ypsilanti and is interred in Highland Cemetery there.

<text>The grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum), also known as the African crowned crane, golden crested crane, golden crowned crane, East African crane, East African crowned crane, African crane, Eastern crowned crane, Kavirondo crane, South African crane, and crested crane, is a bird in the crane family, Gruidae. It is found in nearly all of Africa, especially in eastern and southern Africa, and it is the national bird of Uganda.

==Taxonomy==
The grey crowned crane is closely related to the black crowned crane, and the two species have sometimes been treated as the same species. The two are separable on the basis of genetic evidence, calls, plumage, and bare parts, and all authorities treat them as different species today.

There are two subspecies. The East African &quot;B. r. gibbericeps&quot; (crested crane) occurs in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, of which it is the national bird represented in its national flag, and Kenya to eastern South Africa. It has a larger area of bare red facial skin above the white patch than the smaller nominate species, &quot;B. r. regulorum&quot; (South African crowned crane), which breeds from Angola south to South Africa.

==Description==
The grey crowned crane is approximately tall, weighs , and has a wingspan of . Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are predominantly white but contain feathers with a range of colours, with a distinctive black patch at the very top. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers. The sides of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger. Younger cranes are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff face.

This species and the black crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees, because of a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is assumed to be an ancestral trait among the cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily. Crowned cranes also lack a coiled trachea and have loose plumage compared to the other cranes.

==Distribution and habitat==

The grey crowned crane occurs in dry savannah in Sub-Saharan Africa, although it nests in somewhat wetter habitats. They can also be found in marshes, cultivated lands and grassy flatlands near rivers and lakes in Uganda and Kenya and as far south as South Africa. This animal does not have set migration patterns, and birds nearer the tropics are typically sedentary. Birds in more arid areas, particularly Namibia, make localised seasonal movements during drier periods.

==Behaviour==

The grey crowned crane has a breeding display involving dancing, bowing, and jumping. It has a booming call which involves inflation of the red gular sac. It also makes a honking sound quite different from the trumpeting of other crane species. Both sexes dance, and immature birds join the adults. Dancing is an integral part of courtship, but also may be done at any time of the year.

Flocks of 30–150 birds are not uncommon.

===Diet and feeding===
These cranes are omnivores, eating plants, seeds, grain, insects, frogs, worms, snakes, small fish and the eggs of aquatic animals. Stamping their feet as they walk, they flush out insects which are quickly caught and eaten. The birds also associate with grazing herbivores, benefiting from the ability to grab prey items disturbed by antelopes and gazelles. They spend their entire day looking for food. At night, the crowned crane spends its time in the trees sleeping and resting.

===Breeding===

Grey crowned cranes time their breeding season around the rains, although the effect varies geographically. In East Africa the species breeds year-round, but most frequently during the drier periods, whereas in Southern Africa the breeding season is timed to coincide with the rains. During the breeding season, pairs of cranes construct a large nest; a platform of grass and other plants in tall wetland vegetation.

The grey crowned crane lays a clutch of 2-5 glossy, dirty-white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes for 28–31 days. Chicks are precocial, can run as soon as they hatch, and fledge in 56–100 days. Once they are fully grown and independent, chicks of different sexes will separate from their parents to start their own family. Grey crowned cranes have been seen to congregate in large numbers in a ceremony akin to a wedding when two chicks are being married off. The new couple dance for a while before flying off together to start a new family.

==Relationship with humans==

===Status and conservation===
Although the grey crowned crane remains common over some of its range, it faces threats to its habitat due to drainage, overgrazing, and pesticide pollution. Their global population is estimated to be between 58,000 and 77,000 individuals. In 2012 it was uplisted from vulnerable to endangered by the IUCN.

===Symbolism===

The grey crowned crane is the national bird of Uganda and features in the country&#x27;s flag and coat of arms.

The crane is seen as the titular bird in &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; but is wrongly stated to be Siberian.

<doc id="988918" wikidata="Q1367752" url="?curid=988918" title="Joël Robuchon">
<text>Joël Robuchon (, 7 April 1945 – 6 August 2018) was a French chef and restaurateur. He was named &quot;Chef of the Century&quot; by the guide Gault Millau in 1989, and awarded the &quot;Meilleur Ouvrier de France&quot; (France&#x27;s best worker) in cuisine in 1976. He published several cookbooks, two of which have been translated into English, chaired the committee for the &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, and hosted culinary television shows in France. He operated more than a dozen restaurants across Bangkok, Bordeaux, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, London, Macau, Madrid, Monaco, Montreal, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, and New York City. His restaurants have been acclaimed, and in 2018 he held 32 &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; stars among them, the most any restaurateur has ever held. He is considered to be one of the greatest chefs of all time.

== Biography ==
Robuchon was born in 1945 in Poitiers, France, one of four children of a bricklayer. He attended the seminary in Châtillon-sur-Sèvre (now Mauléon), Deux-Sèvres, briefly considering a clerical career. In 1960, at the age of 15, he became an apprentice chef at the Relais de Poitiers hotel, starting as a pastry chef.

After he turned 21, he joined the apprenticeship Compagnon du Tour de France, enabling him to travel throughout the country, learning a variety of regional techniques. At the age of 29, Robuchon was appointed head chef at the Hôtel Concorde La Fayette, where he managed 90 cooks. In 1976 he won the Meilleur Ouvrier de France for his craftsmanship in culinary arts. While working as an Executive Chef and Food and Beverage manager of the Nikko hotel in Paris he gained two Michelin stars.

In 1981, he opened his own restaurant, Jamin, which holds the rare distinction of receiving three Michelin stars in the first three years of existence. In 1984, Jamin was named &quot;Best Restaurant in the World&quot; by the International Herald Tribune. Between 1987 and 1990, he became a regular of cooking shows on French television.

In 1989, the prestigious restaurant guide &quot;Gault Millau&quot; named Robuchon the &quot;Chef of the Century&quot;. He mentored many famous chefs, including Gordon Ramsay, Eric Ripert, and Michael Caines.

In 1995, seeing many of his peers die of stress and heart attacks, Robuchon retired at the age of 50. He subsequently staged a comeback, opening several restaurants bearing his name around the world. He hosted &quot;Cuisinez comme un grand chef&quot; on TF1 from 1996 to 1999; in 2000, he hosted &quot;Bon appétit bien sûr&quot; on France 3. Through his various restaurants, including the newly awarded 3-star rating for his restaurant in Singapore, he accumulated a total of 32 &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; stars – the most of any chef in the world.

In June 2018, Resorts World Singapore stated that both the three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Restaurant and the two-starred L&#x27;Atelier de Joel Robuchon would close at the end of the month.

Robuchon was a Freemason of the Grande Loge Nationale Française, but he said it did not affect his career.

Robuchon died from cancer on 6 August 2018, a year after receiving treatment for a pancreatic tumour. He was 73.

== Personal life ==
Robuchon and his wife Jeanine, whom he married in 1966, had two children, son Eric Robluchon, a pedicurist and podiatrist based in Paris, and daughter Sophie Kartheiser, who manages a restaurant named La Cour d&#x27;Eymet in Dordogne with her husband, chef François Kartheiser. He also has a son Louis Robuchon-Abe (born 1988) with a Japanese woman. Louis is a wine importer in Japan. Robuchon was survived by his wife, his three children and four grandchildren.

== Legacy ==
Robuchon has been the most influential French chef of the post-nouvelle cuisine era. Since the mid-1980s, he has been called the &quot;primus inter pares&quot; of Paris&#x27; three-star chefs for his work both at Jamin and at his eponymous restaurant.

Robuchon has been known for the relentless perfectionism of his cuisine; he said there is no such thing as the perfect meal – one can always do better. He was instrumental in leading French cuisine forward from the excessive reductionism of &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; toward a post-modern amalgam of the &quot;nouvelle&quot;, international influences – especially Japanese cuisine – and even select traditions of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;. In particular, his style of cooking was often seen as of celebrating the intrinsic qualities of the best, seasonal ingredients (dubbed &quot;cuisine actuelle&quot; by Patricia Wells in her book, &quot;Simply French&quot;). Drawing his inspiration firstly from the simplicity of Japanese cuisine, he led the way in creating a more delicate style respectful of natural food ingredients.

<doc id="988932" wikidata="Q7145798" url="?curid=988932" title="Patricia Pulling">
<text>Patricia A. Pulling (June 30, 1948 – September 18, 1997) was an anti-occult campaigner from Richmond, Virginia. She founded Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons (BADD), an advocacy group that was dedicated to the regulation of role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

==Biography==
Pulling formed B.A.D.D. after her son Irving committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest on June 9, 1982. Irving was active in role-playing games, and she believed his suicide was directly related to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. The grieving mother first filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her son&#x27;s high school principal, Robert A. Bracey III, holding him as responsible for what she claimed was a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; curse placed upon her son&#x27;s character shortly before his death. She also filed suit against TSR, Inc., &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s publishers. She appeared on an episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; which also featured Gary Gygax, creator of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and which aired in 1985.

===B.A.D.D.===
Pulling founded the public advocacy group &quot;Bothered About Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (B.A.D.D.) in 1983 after all of her lawsuits were dismissed and began publishing information circulating her belief that &quot;D&amp;D&quot; encouraged devil worship and suicide. B.A.D.D. described &quot;D&amp;D&quot; as &quot;a fantasy role-playing game which uses demonology, witchcraft, voodoo, murder, rape, blasphemy, suicide, assassination, insanity, sex perversion, homosexuality, prostitution, satanic type rituals, gambling, barbarism, cannibalism, sadism, desecration, demon summoning, necromantics, divination and other teachings.&quot;

B.A.D.D. achieved some success in airing its views in the press, both through conservative Christian media properties as well as mainstream outlets. The organization distributed its materials in Australia through conservative advocacy groups affiliated with the Reverend Fred Nile, such as the Australian Federation for Decency. In addition, Pulling obtained a private investigator&#x27;s license, became a consultant to law enforcement, and was an expert witness in several gaming-related lawsuits, all of which lost in court. She became a director of the National Coalition on TV Violence in 1984. 

Pulling co-authored a book, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Web: Who Is Stalking Your Children For Satan?&quot; published in August 1989. The book makes no distinction between H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional &quot;Necronomicon&quot; and the &quot;Simon Necronomicon&quot;, a realization of the book. One portion of the book urges police officers to open interrogations of suspected teenage occultists with the question &quot;Have you read the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, or are you familiar with it?&quot;

As the popularity of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other role-playing games increased, Pulling&#x27;s views and statements were increasingly called into question. For example, she once told a newspaper reporter that eight percent of the people living in Richmond, Virginia were Satanists. She had arrived at that figure, she explained, by estimating that four percent of the adult population and four percent of the teenage population were involved with Satanism, and added them to get eight percent. When the reporter informed her that mathematically that was four percent, not eight percent, she claimed that it did not matter because even eight percent was a &quot;conservative&quot; figure.

==Response==
In 1989, game player and designer Michael A. Stackpole wrote &quot;Game Hysteria and the Truth&quot;, which went into all the flaws, misconceptions, inaccuracies, omission of relevant details, and questionable practices (such as calling her practice of including newspaper articles in her own documents illegal, since newspapers are copyrighted material and the owners were not contacted about the use of these articles) regarding Pulling&#x27;s claims about RPGs in general and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in particular, concluding: &quot;If the suicide statistics for the 14 years since &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s introduction show anything at all, gamers kill themselves at a rate that is a fraction of that of their peers.&quot; A year later, the main points of &quot;Game Hysteria and the Truth&quot; regarding Pulling were reiterated by Stackpole in &quot;The Pulling Report&quot;, a review highly critical of B.A.D.D.&#x27;s methods of data collection, analysis and reporting. Stackpole found that Pulling had given a misleading account regarding her qualifications, and after he published his report in 1990, Pulling quit B.A.D.D.

==Aftermath==

By 1991 the American Association of Suicidology, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and Health and Welfare Canada all concluded that there was no causal link between fantasy gaming and suicide.

<text>Maxwell &quot;Mac&quot; Dane (June 7, 1906 – August 8, 2004) was an American advertising executive and co-founder of the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency, known as DDB, that was established in Manhattan in 1949. For advertising against U.S. presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964, he became one of the original twenty people mentioned on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family in Cincinnati, Ohio. He spoke Yiddish in his home. Dane began his advertising career in his mid-teens, working as a secretary to the manager of advertising at Stern Brothers in Manhattan, and later, as retail promotion manager at the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Subsequently, he worked as advertising and promotion manager at &quot;Look magazine&quot;, where he met James &quot;Ned&quot; Doyle.

In 1941, Dane began work as advertising promotion manager for the New York radio station, WMCA. During World War II, he arranged for &quot;The New York Times&quot; to air news bulletins at the top of each hour, an innovative idea for radio at the time. In 1944, Dane opened a small advertising agency bearing his name, &quot;Maxwell Dane, Inc.&quot; His short-lived agency was closed in 1949 when Dane co-founded Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) with James Doyle, and Doyle&#x27;s friend, William Bernbach.

When DDB, then considered a firm handling predominantly Democratic candidates during political campaigns, produced the 1964 television commercial &quot;Daisy&quot; in support of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Presidential campaign, Dane was added to Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List with the remark:

The top Democratic advertising firm—they destroyed Goldwater in 1964. They should be hit hard starting with Dane.

At DDB, Dane oversaw finance and public relations functions, later becoming the chairman of the executive committee, secretary, and treasurer of the corporation. He retired from DDB in 1971. His obituary noted, that &quot;after a brief illness, Dane died in his New York home on August 8, 2004. Dane is survived by his wife Esther, his son Henry Dane, four grandchildren; Abraham, Michael, Marion and Samuel, and seven great grandchildren.&quot;

<text>The music of [[Kiribati]] has been less affected by Western culture than most other Pacific island cultures since Europeans did not arrive in Kiribati until 1892. The national anthem of Kiribati is &quot;Kunan Kiribati&quot; (&quot;Song of Kiribati&quot;), by I.T. Uriam; it was adopted upon independence in 1979.

Kiribati folk music is generally based on chanting or other forms of vocalizing, accompanied by body percussion. Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (&quot;Te Kaimatoa&quot;) or the hip dance (&quot;Te Buki&quot;) a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed so as to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children&#x27;s, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also stick dances (which accompany legends and semi-historical stories. These stick dances or &#x27;tirere&#x27; (pronounced seerere) are only performed during major festivals.

In 1963 Gerd Koch filmed on Tabiteuea traditional dances and songs of the &quot;ruoia&quot; series: the &quot;kawawa&quot;, the introductory song and dance; the &quot;kamei&quot; with a dance leader, the &quot;wan tarawa&quot; and the &quot;kabuakaka&quot;; and a &quot;bino&quot; song and dance complete with accompanying arm movements. Koch also filmed traditions songs and dances on Onotoa and Nonouti.

Bata Teinamati has been described as one of Kiribati&#x27;s most notable musicians.

==Folk song composition==
Its traditional music is composed by people known as &quot;te kainikamaen&quot;. These composers are said to receive their songs from myth or magic, an ability that is said to pass from father to son. After composition, a group called &quot;rurubene&quot; sings the song to the composer, after which it is made public and is sung by anyone; at this point, the song is considered blessed (&quot;mamiraki&quot;).

Composers also write songs on demand, telling a story told to him by an individual. The composer will then sing it and teach it to the &quot;rurubene&quot;, making any needed changes. Composers also occasionally create songs of their own accord.

Nowadays, not all music in Kiribati is composed by people known as te kainikamaen because of civilization and because of the introduction of western music, rather almost anyone can compose a song and sing it but he/she needs to count is as a song from a poem not from myth or magic otherwise there may be curses as part of the Kiribati Beliefs. Curses include: losing of hair and sudden death.

<doc id="988951" wikidata="Q2495825" url="?curid=988951" title="University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff">
<text>The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) is a public historically black university in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Founded in 1873, it is the second oldest public college or university in Arkansas. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; established by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. UAPB is part of the University of Arkansas System and Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==

The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff was authorized in 1873 by the Reconstruction-era legislature as the Branch Normal College and opened in 1875 with Joseph Carter Corbin principal. A historically black college, it was nominally part of the &quot;normal&quot; (education) department of Arkansas Industrial University, later the University of Arkansas. It was operated separately as part of a compromise to get a college for black students, as the state maintained racial segregation well into the 20th century. (Although the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville was integrated when it opened in 1872, it soon became segregated after the end of Reconstruction and didn&#x27;t start desegregation until 1948.) It later was designated as a land-grant college under the 1890 federal amendments to Morrill Land-Grant Acts. As Congress had originally established the land grant colleges to provide education to all qualified students in a state, in 1890 it required states maintaining segregated systems to establish a separate land-grant university for blacks as well as whites.

In 1927, the school severed its ties with the University of Arkansas and became Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical &amp; Normal College (Arkansas AM&amp;N). It moved to its current campus location in 1929.

In the mid-1950s AM&amp;N administrators asked students not to support civil rights causes perceived as radical by Arkansas politicians as they feared getting their funding cut by the state. John B. Pickhart, an alumnus of the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, wrote that therefore AM&amp;N being in Pine Bluff &quot;might actually have slowed development of an integration movement&quot; for that community.

In 1972, Arkansas AM&amp;N re-joined what is now the University of Arkansas System. As a full-fledged campus with graduate study departments, it gained its current name and university status in the process.

Since 1988, the university has gained recognition as a leading research institution in aquaculture studies, offering the state&#x27;s only comprehensive program in this field. It supports a growing regional industry throughout the Mid-South (according to the school, aquaculture is a $167 million industry in Arkansas alone and worth approximately $1.2 billion in the Mississippi Delta region). In 2012, the program was enhanced by the addition of an Aquaculture/Fisheries PhD program.

The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is the oldest and largest HBCU in Arkansas.

==Academics==
UAPB is divided into eight academic divisions.
*The School of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Human Sciences
*The School of Arts and Sciences
*The School of Business and Management
*The School of Education
*Graduate Studies &amp; Continuing Education 
*Carolyn F. Blakely Honors Program
*Military Science 
*University College

UAPB is fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

UAPB has the only comprehensive aquaculture program in Arkansas, established to help support the state&#x27;s $167 million aquaculture industry.

Since UAPB offers only one engineering degree program (agricultural engineering), it has a partnership with the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville (UA) that allow qualified students to spend three years to complete an engineering related bachelor&#x27;s degree at UAPB then automatic admissions into UA to complete their engineering bachelor&#x27;s degree in two years. Students who successfully complete the UAPB-UA engineering program will have two bachelor&#x27;s degrees in approximately five years.

In 2019, UAPB established a partnership a with UALR William H. Bowen School of Law. UAPB students with at least a 3.4 cumulative GPA, minimum 154 LSAT score, and a clean disciplinary record will automatically be admitted. In addition to being admitted, they will receive a 25 percent tuition scholarship.

==University Museum and Cultural Center==
The University Museum and Cultural Center on the campus of UAPB contains photographs, catalogs, yearbooks, letters, artifacts, portraits and other ephemera that document the lives and culture of African-Americans who helped shaped the history of UAPB and the Arkansas Delta. It is the only museum of its kind in Arkansas and was established in 2005.

== Athletics ==

UAPB&#x27;s colors are black and gold and their nickname is the Golden Lions.
Arkansas–Pine Bluff&#x27;s sports teams have participated in NCAA Division I in the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) since re-joining the conference in 1998, and competes in the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA) for football. Home football games are held at Golden Lion Stadium. Men&#x27;s sports also include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

== Student life ==

=== Residential life ===

The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff houses over 1,000 students on campus. Hunt Hall (named in memory of Silas Hunt, the first black law student at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville) houses male students. The Harrold Complex, consisting of four halls, Johnson, Copeland, Fischer, and Stevens, is for females. Freshman males are assigned to Johnson and Copeland.

===Marching band===

In 2008, UAPB&#x27;s band known as the Marching Musical Machine of the Mid-South (M4), made their debut appearance at the Honda Battle of the Bands. In 2009, M4 was selected to participate in the United States Presidential Inaugural Parade.

M4 is one of the top three largest collegiate marching bands in Arkansas and is accompanied by two auxiliaries. The dance auxiliary is known as the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; and the flag auxiliary is known as the &quot;24K Golden Silks.&quot; M4 is a five drum major led marching band.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
Eight of the nine National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) fraternities and sororities are represented on campus. Less than five percent of the undergraduate student body are represented in the NPHC. The university also hosts four of the seven fraternity and sorority organizations part of the National Interfraternity Music Council (NIMC).

<doc id="988959" wikidata="Q688969" url="?curid=988959" title="Treaty of Bromberg">
<text>The Treaty of Bromberg (, Latin: Pacta Bydgostensia) or Treaty of Bydgoszcz was a treaty between John II Casimir of Poland and Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia that was ratified at Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) on 6 November 1657. The treaty had several agreements, including the Treaty of Wehlau, signed on 19 September 1657 by the Brandenburg–Prussian and Polish–Lithuanian envoys in Wehlau (Welawa, now Znamensk). Thus, the Treaty of Bromberg is sometimes referred to as treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg or Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg ().

In exchange for military aid in the Second Northern War and the return of Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) to Poland, the Polish king granted the Hohenzollern dynasty of Brandenburg hereditary sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia, pawned Draheim (Drahim) and Elbing (Elbląg) to Brandenburg and handed over Lauenburg and Bütow Land to the Hohenzollerns as a hereditary fief.

The treaty was confirmed and internationally recognized in the Peace of Oliva in 1660. Elbing was kept by Poland, but Lauenburg and Bütow Land and Draheim were later integrated into Brandenburg-Prussia. The sovereignty in Prussia constituted the basis for the later coronation of the Hohenzollern as Prussian kings. Wehlau-Bromberg remained in effect until it was superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (18 September 1773) after the First Partition of Poland. The Treaty of Bromberg later became regarded as one of the worst mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia after its consequences had become fatal to Poland.

==Context==

The Duchy of Prussia was established as a Polish fief under duke Albrecht (Albert) in the Treaty of Cracow of 8 April 1525. The fief was hereditary, and if Albrecht or his brothers&#x27; house became extinct in the male line, the fief was to pass to the Polish king, who was to appoint a German-speaking Prussian-born governor. On 4 June 1563, that provision was changed by Polish King Sigismund II Augustus in a privilege issued at Petrikau, which, in addition to Albrecht&#x27;s branch of the House of Hohenzollern (Hohenzollern-Ansbach), allowed the Brandenburg branch of the Hohenzollern as possible successors. The privilege provided for the succession of the Brandenburgian electors as Prussian dukes upon the extinction of the House of Hohenzollern-Ansbach in 1618.

In 1656, during the early Second Northern War, the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern took the Prussian duchy and Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) as Swedish fiefs in the Treaty of Königsberg, before the Swedish king released them from the vassalage and made them absolute sovereigns in those provinces. After fighting along with the Swedish Army in 1656, most prominently at the Battle of Warsaw, Hohenzollern Frederick William I was willing to abandon his ally when the war had turned against them and signalled his willingness to change sides if Polish King John II Casimir Vasa would grant him similar privileges as previously Swedish King Charles X Gustav, conditions that were negotiated in Wehlau (Welawa, now Znamensk) and Bromberg (Bygost, Bydgoszcz).

The Polish interest in an alliance with Brandenburg-Prussia was born out of the need to end the war against Sweden as soon as possible. On 3 November 1656, the Truce of Vilna had promised Alexis of Russia&#x27;s election as a successor on the Polish throne at the next diet in return for halting his offensive in Poland–Lithuania and to fight Sweden instead. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there was support for the treaty from the nobles, who hoped for positions with more privilege, but that was not true for the Kingdom of Poland, where the elites looked for ways to circumvent Alexis&#x27;s succession. For a fast end to the war against Sweden to be able to avoid the implementation of the Truce of Vilna, the anti-Swedish alliance had to be extended.

The newly won Russian ally was reluctant to support Poland against Sweden as long as no diet had confirmed the truce. A second ally, the Austrian Habsburgs, were won in the first and the second Vienna Treaties, but the Habsburg forces were to be maintained by Poland, the prize for the alliance was bound to rise while the war lasted. A third ally was Denmark-Norway, which joined the anti-Swedish coalition in June 1657 after it had been triggered by the second Treaty of Vienna. However, Denmark was not fighting on Polish soil, and although its involvement tied down Charles X Gustav&#x27;s forces and a formal alliance with Poland was concluded in July, the Danish aimed to recover Scandinavian territories, which had been lost at the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645).

The Habsburgs&#x27; interest in the treaty was to build up good relations with Frederick William I. As a prince-elector, he was a valuable ally if he supported their policy in the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, the Habsburgs were interested in Frederick William I changing sides and sent diplomat Franz Paul Freiherr von Lisola to mediate a respective settlement.

Bromberg and Wehlau are regarded as &quot;twin treaties&quot;, &quot;supplementary treaties&quot; or one treaty, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg&quot; or &quot;Treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg.&quot;

==Ratification==

The preliminary treaty of Wehlau had been signed on 19 September 1657 by Frederick William I&#x27;s envoys von Schwerin and von Somnitz, as well as by Warmian (Ermland) prince-bishop and Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Habsburg delegate and mediator Freiherr .

The amended and final version of the treaty was ratified on 6 November by Frederick William I and John II Casimir in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz). The Brandenburgian elector and the Polish king attended the ceremony with their wives, Luise Henriette of Nassau and Marie Louise Gonzaga, respectively. Danzig (Gdansk) Mayor Adrian von der Linde was also present.

The Treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg were confirmed by the parties and internationally recognized at the Peace of Oliva, which ended the Second Northern War in 1660, and by the Polish Sejm in 1659 and 1661.

==Agreements==
The treaty ratified in Bromberg had three parts. The first one contained 22 articles and dealt primarily with the status and succession of Prussia, the Brandenburg-Polish alliance, and military aid. It was drafted in Wehlau and signed there by the Brandenburgian and Polish plenipotentiaries and the Habsburg mediator. The second part was a special convention (&quot;Specialis Convention&quot;) containing 6 articles, also drafted and signed by the plenipotentiaries and the mediator in Wehlau, which further detailed the alliance and military aid. The third part amended the Wehlau agreement and primarily detailed Polish concessions.

===Status of Prussia===
The Duchy of Prussia—where Frederick William I had become fully sovereign by the Brandenburg-Swedish Treaty of Labiau—was likewise accepted by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to be the sovereign possession of the House of Hohenzollern.

However, Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) was to be returned to Poland. And if the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern dynasty became extinct in the male line, the Prussian duchy was agreed to pass on to the Polish crown. That made Prussian estates have to pay conditional allegiance to an envoy of subsequent Polish kings upon their succession (&quot;hommagium eventuale, Eventualhuldigung&quot;), and they were released from previous oaths and obligations regarding the Polish crown.

The Roman Catholic Church in the former Duchy of Prussia was to remain subordinate to the archbishop of Ermland (Warmia), retain its possessions and income and be granted religious freedom.

===Military aid===
Brandenburg-Prussia was obliged to give military aid to Poland against the Swedish Empire during the ongoing Second Northern War. Frederick William I had in Wehlau agreed to aid John II Casimir Vasa with 8,000 men, and both parties agreed on an &quot;eternal alliance&quot;. In Bromberg, it was agreed that from his Prussian province, Frederick William I would dispatch 1,500 foot and 500 horse to join the army of the Polish king.

===Financial and territorial agreements===
In return, the Polish crown granted Brandenburg-Prussia Lauenburg and Bütow Land as a hereditary fief. It was to be held at the same conditions as previously granted to the House of Pomerania, free of duties except that the House of Hohenzollern had sent envoys to the coronations of successive Polish kings, who were then to receive a written confirmation of the fief. If the Hohenzollern dynasty had no male heir, the fief should return to the Polish crown.

In addition to Lauenburg and Bütow land, Brandenburg-Prussia was to receive the town of Elbing (Elbląg). In an amendment, Brandenburg-Prussia was obliged to return the town to Poland once the latter had bailed it out with 400,000 thalers.

The third Polish concession was the payment of 120,000 thalers to Brandenburg-Prussia for war-related damage suffered upon entering the war by Poland. As a security for this payment, the district of Draheim was to be handed over to Brandenburg for three years. The district comprised the town of Tempelburg (now Czaplinek) and 18 villages at the border of Brandenburgian Pomerania. The sum was to be paid in annual rates of 40,000 thalers, and Brandenburg was to keep Draheim if the money had not been paid by the end of the third year.

For the Catholics in Draheim, religious freedom was guaranteed. The Hohenzollern also agreed to grant religious freedom to the Catholic Church in Lauenburg and Bütow Land. The Catholic communities were to stay subordinate to and to be represented by the Kuyavian bishop and keep all of their income, and the Electors of Brandenburg and the local nobility were to have patronage over the churches.

The rights of the nobility of Lauenburg and Bütow Land were to be left unchanged, and previous court sentences and privileges were to remain in force. The administration of the region should be conducted just as it had been handled by the Pomeranian dukes. In a note issued separately from the treaty, John II Casimir assured the nobles that Poland would continue to treat them as members of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and so the nobles would enjoy the same rights and opportunities as the Polish nobles if they decided to leave for Poland.

==Implementation==
===Prussia===

The treaty first met with the protest of the Prussian estates, which feared a loss of privileges. As a leader of the opposition, Königsberg mayor Hieronymus Roth was incarcerated for 16 years until his death. The estates&#x27; protests ended in 1663, when they swore allegiance to Frederick William I. The ecclesiastical subordination of the Roman Catholic Church to the Polish Royal Prussian prince-bishop of Ermland (Warmia) also caused tensions with the House of Hohenzollern. Despite those problems, sovereignty in the Prussian duchy provided the basis for the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern to crown themselves &quot;King in Prussia&quot; in 1701.

===Lauenburg and Bütow Land===
Lauenburg and Bütow Land was officially handed over by John II Casimir&#x27;s envoy Ignatz Bokowski and received by the Brandenburg-Prussian envoys Adam von Podewils and Ulrich Gottfried von Somnitz in April 1658. During the ceremony, the non-noble inhabitants swore the same oath of allegiance to the Brandenburgian electors that had been sworn to the Pomeranian dukes, and the nobles swore a modified oath. The oath was given by 63 noble families from the Lauenburg district and 43 families of the Bütow district, which was represented at the ceremony by 220 persons. Three persons swore in Polish. The Brandenburg-Prussian administration did not accept all of the families as nobles since in May, only thirteen indigenous and six immigrated Pomeranian families in the Lauenburg district and four families in the Bütow district were listed as nobles, the others being referred to as &quot;besondere freye Leute&quot; (&quot;special free persons&quot;).

The Brandenburgian electors amended their title with &quot;dominus de Lauenburg et Bytaw&quot;, despite Polish protests aimed at a change from &quot;dominus&quot; (lord) to &quot;fiduciarus&quot; (fiduciary). Until 1771, Lauenburg and Bütow Land was administered from Lauenburg (now Lębork), where the local &quot;Oberhauptmann&quot; had his seat; the nobles swore allegiance to the electors; and assemblies of the nobles were held in a &quot;landtag&quot;, the Seymik. After 1771, the region was governed from Stettin (now Szczecin), like the rest of Brandenburgian Pomerania, and allegiance to subsequent Prussian kings was given with the other Pomeranian estates in Stettin.

The provision that Brandenburgian envoys were to be sent to the inauguration of subsequent Polish kings was followed until 1698, when Brandenburg-Prussia ceased to send delegations. The Treaty of Bromberg was superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (1773), which followed the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In the new treaty, the terms of Bromberg were cancelled, including the guarantees for the Catholic Church and the nobles, and the Polish crown renounced all rights on Lauenburg and Bütow Land, which was accordingly no longer a fief and would no longer be inherited by the Polish king if the Hohenzollern line became extinct.

===Elbing/Elbląg===
In 1660, the Swedish garrison withdrew from Elbing (Elbląg), but the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth seized it although it had not paid the sum that had been agreed on in Bromberg. That made Frederick William I not support Poland in the contemporary Russo-Polish War, but he yielded the neutrality agreement that he had concluded with Russia in 1656. Poland would keep the town until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, with short interruptions in 1698/1699 and 1703. In 1698, Polish King Augustus II the Strong permitted Prussian troops to besiege and storm Elbing, but the Prussian troops withdrew the following year when Russia mediated its exchange for the Polish Crown Jewels as a security for the bills receivable. When Augustus the Strong failed to pay, the town was reoccupied in 1703, during the Great Northern War, but the Prussians again withdrew shortly afterwards because of Swedish pressure.

===Draheim===
In addition to Elbing, Poland aimed at also keeping Draheim, but Frederick William I was able to thwart those plans by occupying it in 1663. In the 1720s, the government of the Brandenburgian province of Pomerania took over administrative tasks regarding Draheim, but it retained its independence from the Pomeranian province until the terms of the Treaty of Bromberg were superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (1773). Before the 1773 treaty, Poland had the nominal right to bail out Draheim, which was never pursued. Nevertheless, the Polish crown underlined that right by granting privileges to the local Schulze until 1680. In Article V of the Warsaw Treaty, Poland renounced its right to buy Draheim back and ceded it to Prussia &quot;for eternal times&quot;.

==Assessments==
According to Robert I. Frost the House of Hohenzollern, Wehlau-Bromberg was a &quot;major geopolitical gain and surge in wealth and prestige&quot;, and Poland had &quot;substantially benefited&quot; from Brandenburgian support during the war. The concessions that Poland made in Wehlau and Bromberg were thought as tactical and open to later reversal, which did not happen because of Poland&#x27;s internal weakness. Christopher M. Clark says that John Casimir of Poland was &quot;eager to separate Brandenburg from Sweden and to neutralize it as a military threat&quot; when Poland–Lithuania was threatened by the Tsardom of Russia and ready to accept the Hohenzollerns&#x27; demands because of pressure by the House of Habsburg, which, after the emperor&#x27;s incidental death earlier that year, needed to secure the elector&#x27;s vote since its &quot;urgings [...] carried considerable weight since the Poles were counting on Austrian assistance in the event of a renewed Swedish or Russian attack&quot;. Clark thus views Frederick William as a &quot;beneficiary of international developments beyond his control&quot; and verifies his thesis by the post-Bromberg developments in which the elector lost all further war gains because of French intervention at the Treaty of Oliva.

Józef Włodarski regards the treaty as one of the greatest mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia with fatal consequences for Poland. According to Anna Kamińska, the treaty marked the end of Polish influence on the Baltic and the decline of Poland–Lithuania&#x27;s position in Europe. Frost says that the treaty was subject to criticism of historians such as Kazimierz Piwarski, who considered that the price paid by Poland in Bromberg was unnecessarily high. According to Frost, these critics argue from a view after the partitions of Poland and neglect the complexity of the contemporary situation: &quot;Contemporary [Polish] politicians were aware of the dangers of conceding sovereignty, which they accepted not because they were stupid, indifferent, or lacking in foresight, but because the alternatives seemed more damaging to the Commonwealth&#x27;s interests&quot;. Frost regards as having merit Piwarski&#x27;s assertion of the Polish decision to have been heavily influenced by the Habsburgs but also states that the Polish interest in a rapprochement with Brandenburg had emerged before 1656, long before Lisola entered the scene.

<text>The Gaiety Theatre is a theatre on South King Street in Dublin, Ireland, off Grafton Street and close to St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. It specialises in operatic and musical productions, with occasional dramatic shows.

==History==
In April 1871, the brothers John and Michael Gunn obtained a 21-year licence to establish &quot;a well-regulated theatre and therein at all times publicly to act, represent or perform any interlude, tragedy, comedy, prelude, opera, burletta, play, farce or pantomime&quot;. In favour of the Gunn&#x27;s licence application was that, unlike the existing theatres, they were not proposing to promote local drama which had acquired something of a reputation with the Dublin Castle administration for stirring up nationalist sentiments.

The city centre site was 17 metres wide on King Street and 42 metres deep towards Tangier Lane. The Gunns employed the experienced theatre architect C.J. Phipps. One of the theatres Phipps had recently completed in 1868 in London was the Gaiety and its name and auditorium layout were adopted for the new theatre in Dublin. The audience capacity was 2000 spread over four floors: the &#x27;parterre&#x27; or ground floor pit with 21 rows of seats; the dress circle and upper circle comprising: balcony stalls with 7 rows of seats, the first circle with 6 rows of seats, the amphitheater with 2 rows of seats; and the top floor gallery with 9 rows of seats; plus 14 private boxes. Each class of seats was accessed via its own entrance and stairway. There was a smoking balcony, bars on each floor and a tea-room. The design included tip-up seats (an innovative way of increasing the audience capacity) and fire-safety features such as a 4” water main (for firefighting) and stone (not wooden) staircases. Back stage: the theatre was radically different from others in Ireland. From the outset the Gunns decided that their new theatre would be a ‘receiving house’: that is, it would receive touring companies and would not have its own company of actors or a repertory programme: As a receiving house, there was no need for extensive rehearsal spaces, workshops or storage areas.

The theatre was built for £26,000, and construction was completed in just 28 weeks. The Gaiety was opened on 27 November 1871, with the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland as guest of honour for a double bill which included the comedy &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; and a burlesque version of &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot;.

The Gaiety was extended by theatre architect Frank Matcham in 1883, and, despite several improvements to public spaces and stage changes, it retains several Victorian era features and remains Dublin&#x27;s longest-established, continuously producing theatre.

Patrick Wall and Louis Elliman bought the theatre in 1936 and ran it for several decades with local actors and actresses. They sold it in 1965, and in the 1960s and the 1970s the theatre was run by Fred O&#x27;Donovan and the Eamonn Andrews Studios, until - in the 1980s - Joe Dowling (former artistic director of the Abbey Theatre) became director of the Gaiety. In the 1990s, &quot;Groundwork Productions&quot; took on the lease and the theatre was eventually bought by the &quot;Break for the Border Group&quot;. The Gaiety was purchased by music promoters MCD (in turn owned by Denis Desmond and his wife Caroline) in the late 1990s. The new owners undertook a refit of the theatre, with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism contributing to the restoration fund.

==Use==
Performers and playwrights associated with the theatre have been celebrated with hand-prints cast in bronze and set in the pavement beneath the theatre canopy. These handprints include those of Luciano Pavarotti, Brendan Grace, Maureen Potter, Twink, John B Keane, Anna Manahan, Niall Toibin and Brian Friel.

The theatre played host to the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest, the first to be staged in Ireland, during the Gaiety&#x27;s centenary year. Clodagh Rodgers (a contestant in that particular contest) later presented her RTÉ TV series &quot;The Clodagh Rodgers Show&quot; from the theatre in the late 1970s.

The Gaiety is known for its annual Christmas pantomime and has hosted a pantomime every year since December 1873, though no production was possible in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, with the scheduled panto, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; postponed until 2021. Actor and director Alan Stanford directed both Gaiety productions of &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Irish entertainer June Rodgers starred in the Gaiety pantomime for years, until she began to headline the equally established Olympia Theatre panto. The Gaiety&#x27;s pantomimes have included Irish performers that appeal to homegrown audiences, including a number of &quot;Fair City&quot; actors.

<doc id="988973" wikidata="Q336073" url="?curid=988973" title="Remaindered book">
<text>Remaindered books or remainders are printed books that are no longer selling well, and whose remaining unsold copies are liquidated by the publisher at greatly reduced prices. While the publisher may take a net loss on the sales of these books, they are able to recover at least some of their sunk costs on the sale and clear out space in the warehouses.

Copies of remaindered books may be marked by the publisher, distributor, or bookseller to prevent them from being returned. &quot;Remainder marks&quot; have varied over the years, but today most remainders are marked with a stroke with a felt-tipped marker across the top or bottom of the book&#x27;s pages, near the spine.

Only hardcovers and trade paperbacks (paperback books, often larger than &quot;pocket&quot; paperbacks, sold &quot;to the trade&quot; or directly to sales outlets) are typically remaindered. Mass market paperbacks (&quot;pocket&quot; paperback books sold through a third-party distributor) usually become stripped books rather than remaindered books. A typical remaindered book will be purchased far below the retail price by a specialist in remainders and resold for a fraction of the retail price.

==In the United States==
Since &quot;Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue&quot;, books in the United States have been remaindered much earlier and in greater quantities than prior to the 1979 decision. Since then, the number of unsold books that have simply been destroyed (by being trashed, burned, or recycled) instead of being sold at a large reduction has also risen greatly.

<text>The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama is a museum operated by the government of Alabama, showcasing rockets, achievements, and artifacts of the U.S. space program. Sometimes billed as &quot;Earth&#x27;s largest space museum&quot;, astronaut Owen Garriott described the place as, &quot;a great way to learn about space in a town that has embraced the space program from the very beginning.&quot;

The center opened in 1970, just after the Apollo 12 Moon landing, the second crewed mission to the lunar surface. It showcases Apollo Program hardware, including the Apollo 16 capsule, and also houses interactive science exhibits, Space Shuttle exhibits, and Army rocketry and aircraft. With more than 1,500 permanent rocketry and space exploration artifacts, as well as many rotating rocketry and space-related exhibits, the center occupies land carved out of Redstone Arsenal adjacent to Huntsville Botanical Garden at exit 15 on Interstate 565. The center offers bus tours of nearby NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.

Two camp programs offer visitors the opportunity to stay on the grounds to learn more about spaceflight and aviation. U.S. Space Camp gives an in-depth exposure to the space program through participant use of simulators, lectures, and training exercises. Aviation Challenge offers a taste of military fighter pilot training, including simulations, lectures, and survival exercises. Both camps provide residential and day camp educational programs for children and adults.

==Exhibits==
The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center has one of the most extensive collections of space artifacts and displays more than 1500 pieces. Displays include rockets, engines, spacecraft, simulators, and hands-on exhibits.
The Space &amp; Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts via both indoor and outdoor displays, from its predecessor at Peenemünde with the German V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, through a progression of U.S. military rockets, such as the Redstone and Jupiter IRBM vehicles, and civilian derivatives such as the Mercury-Redstone and the Juno II, up to the Saturn rocket family civilian rockets, including the vertically displayed Saturn I Block 2 Dynamic Test Vehicle, &quot;SA-D5&quot;, which has become a famous local landmark, and on to the Space Shuttle. The Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle, &quot;SA-500D&quot;, the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum, is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket named &quot;Davidson Center for Space Exploration&quot;. The , sometimes described as the first manufactured Space Shuttle Orbiter, was a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for later handling the actual vehicle. Until it was removed for refurbishment in February 2021 it sat atop an external tank with solid rocket boosters attached. The was lifted back into place on the external tank and boosters in September 2024. A homecoming rededication took place on October 24, 2024.
The center showcases significant military rockets, including representatives of the Project Nike series, which formed the first ballistic missile defense, MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile, Hermes, an early surface-to-surface missile, MGR-1 Honest John and Corporal nuclear missiles and Patriot, first used in the Gulf War of 1991.

The rocketry collection includes numerous engines, as well. In addition to the authentic engines mounted on rockets on display, the museum has unmounted engines on display, including two F-1s, the type of gigantic engine that produced to push Saturn Vs off the launch pad, J-2 engine that powered second and third stages of the Saturn V, and both Descent and Ascent Propulsion System (DPS/APS) engines for the Lunar Module. Engines from the V-2 engine to NERVA to the Space Shuttle Main Engine are on display as well. The rocket park area renovation was completed in November 2024. 
The Apollo program gets full coverage in the Davidson Center for Space Exploration with artifacts outlining Apollo missions. Astronauts crossed the service structure&#x27;s red walkway to the White Room, both on display, and climbed in the Command Module atop a Saturn V which was their cabin for the trip to the Moon and back. The Apollo 16 command module, which carried astronauts John Young, Charles Duke and Ken Mattingly, orbited the Moon 64 times in 1972, is on display. The Saturn V Instrument Unit controlled five F-1 engines in the first stage of the rocket as it lifted off the pad. Several exhibits relate the complexity and magnitude of that phase of the journey. They took a Lunar Module (mockup on display) to the lunar surface where they collected Moon rocks such as the Apollo 12 Lunar Sample Number 12065,15 at the museum. Later Moon trips took a Lunar Roving Vehicle (displayed beside the LM). The first few Moon trips ended at a Mobile Quarantine Facility (Apollo 12&#x27;s is on display) where astronauts stayed to ensure containment of any Moon contamination after that mission.
A restored engineering mock-up of Skylab is also on display, showing the Apollo project&#x27;s post-lunar efforts. Various simulators help visitors understand the spaceflight experience. Space Shot lets the rider experience launch-like 4 gs and 2–3 seconds of weightlessness. G-Force Accelerator offers 3 gs of acceleration for an extended period by means of a centrifuge. Several other simulators entertain and educate visitors.

Other exhibits offer a hands-on understanding of concepts related to rocketry or space travel. A bell jar demonstrates the reason for using a rocket instead of a propeller in the vacuum of space. A wind tunnel offers visitors the opportunity to manipulate a model to see how forces change with its orientation, and The Mind of Saturn exhibit demonstrates gyroscopic force (necessary for rocket navigation). An Apollo trainer offers visitors the opportunity to climb in.

Some simulators on exhibit were used for astronaut training. A Project Mercury simulator shows the cramped conditions endured by the first Americans in space. A Gemini simulator shows visitors the accommodations when two people flew together to space for the first U.S. missions involving extra-vehicular activities and space rendezvous.

Exhibits also cover the future of space flight. Two Orion spacecraft exhibits show the next NASA spacecraft, and a Bigelow Aerospace commercial habitat model details a space tourism effort.

===Bus tours===
The Space &amp; Rocket Center offers bus tours of Marshall Space Flight Center. The tour offers views of all four National Historic Landmarks at the center including a stop at the landmark Redstone Test Stand, where Alan Shepard&#x27;s Redstone Rocket was tested prior to launch. Another scheduled stop is the Payload Operations and Integration Center, which serves as mission control for a number of experiments. Bus tours originally started July 4, 1972, but were suspended following the September 11 attacks in 2001. 
Tours resumed July 20, 2012, the 43rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, limited to U.S. citizens because of security protocol at the Army installation, Redstone Arsenal, which contains Marshall Space Flight Center. As of 2023, bus tours of MSFC are no longer offered. Bus tours of Space Camp&#x27;s Aviation Challenge are available. 

===Traveling exhibits===
In the summer of 2010, the Space and Rocket Center began hosting traveling exhibits. The first was Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination with other exhibits planned. The United States Space Camp hosted at the facility has provided themed camps in conjunction with the exhibits, including a Jedi Experience camp.

Other traveling exhibits include:
* The Chronicles of Narnia: The Exhibition Traveling Exhibit
* CSI: The Experience Traveling Exhibit
* A T-Rex Named Sue and Be the Dinosaur
* 100 Years of Von Braun: His American Journey
* Mammoths and Mastodons: Titans of the Ice Age

==Miss Baker gravesite==
The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center is the resting place of Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey who flew on a suborbital test flight of the PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on May 28, 1959. Baker lived in a facility at the center from 1971 until she died of kidney failure in November 1984.

==History==
The idea for the museum was first proposed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who led the efforts of the United States to land the first man on the Moon. Plans for the museum were underway in 1960 with an economic feasibility study for the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce.

Von Braun, understanding the dominance of football in the Alabama culture, persuaded rival Alabama and Auburn coaches Bear Bryant and Shug Jordan to appear in a television commercial supporting a $1.9 million statewide bond referendum to finance museum construction. The referendum passed on November 30, 1965, and a donation of land from the Army&#x27;s Redstone Arsenal provided a location on which to build.
To help draw tourists from far afield, the center needed a crown jewel. &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; reported, Center director &quot;Edward O. Buckbee is the type of guy with the tenacity to &#x27;arrange&#x27; for this planet&#x27;s largest, most complex mechanical beast to become a part of the Alabama Space and Rocket Center at Huntsville. / Pulling off the coup – getting a Saturn 5 moon rocket here which cost 90 times the center itself – was &#x27;a little difficult,&#x27; admits Buckbee in a galloping understatement.&quot; Buckbee worked with von Braun to see that the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle would be delivered to the site as it was on June 28, 1969. The Saturn I Block 2 Dynamic Test Vehicle which stands erect at the museum was delivered the same day. Initial plans called for visitors to walk through the Saturn V. The center opened on March 17, 1970.

The Space &amp; Rocket Center was a &quot;major sponsor&quot; of the United States pavilion at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair, providing exhibits on space and energy as well as equipment and operations for the IMAX theater at the fair. At the time, the Space &amp; Rocket Center also served as the Alabama Energy Information Center. The Spacedome IMAX theater at the museum opened December 19, 1982. The theater closed October 7, 2018 and was converted into the Intuitive Planetarium, featuring high-definition digital projectors, which opened February 28, 2019.
Mike Wing plunged the Center into debt as its executive director from 1998 to 1999. Wing oversaw construction of a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica to be finished by the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, July 1999. It serves as a towering landmark in Huntsville, and cost the center $8.6 million of borrowed money. The &quot;Huntsville Times&quot; estimated interest costs at $10 million. Wing also sought to create a program for fifth grade students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them. Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission&#x27;s investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received. The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million. Wing was pressured to resign, and several members of the governing Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission were ousted from that board as a result of the debacle. At the end of Wing&#x27;s term as director, the center was $26 million in debt. The state sued Wing for $7.5 million over the Space Camp fraud. They settled for $500,000.

The expenditures would shape more than the next decade for the center. Bill Stender took over from ousted Wing as acting chief executive officer on October 14, 1999.

The board of directors was largely changed out in the shakeup removing Wing. New directors included Larry Capps who was selected to head the museum on February 9, 2000, after Stender&#x27;s interim appointment. He reduced the debt to $16 million while also building the Davidson Center for Space Exploration and moving the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle into its custom-built facility. Capps was director through his retirement in 2010.

Dr. Deborah Barnhart, who headed Space Camp from 1986 to 1990, was selected to run the museum in 2010. She has since brought Orion and other post-Shuttle training apparatus to Space Camp and retired the center&#x27;s line of credit, reducing interest expenditures. The center had about $13 million debt in May 2014. Barnhart retired in December 2019.

In July 2020, the center put out a plea for donations to help make ends meet since two–thirds of revenue had been lost due to shutdowns and cancellations from the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of the center&#x27;s unique governance, it was not eligible for any state or federal bailout programs. After a week, the center&#x27;s fundraiser met its $1.5 million goal to continue operations through April 2021.

On December 15, 2020, the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission announced that Dr. Kimberly Robinson would be the next director, starting February 15, 2021.

==Buildings==
Huntsville architect David Crowe designed the initial building with of exhibit space. Since 1969, Huntsville residents could point to the vertical Saturn I rocket at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center as a distant landmark (located a few miles from the city center). In 1999, a full-scale model of the Saturn V rocket was erected, standing nearly twice as tall as the Saturn I.

From 1979 to 2023 an unflown Saturn IB rocket owned by MSFC and leased to the museum stood at the Alabama Welcome Center in Ardmore &quot;as a reminder to visitors of Alabama&#x27;s role in the space program.&quot; It was removed and salvaged due to lack of maintenance in September 2023. 

The dome theater addition opened December 19, 1982, and was updated in early 2019 to be the INTUITIVE Planetarium.

The 1986 film &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; promoted the camp and inspired more than a doubling of camp attendees (from 5,000 in 1986 to 11,000 in 1987), and the facilities had to be expanded again.

A $3 million NASA Educator Resource Center was built during Larry Capps&#x27;s tenure, opening mid-2005.
The newest addition to the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center is the Davidson Center for Space Exploration, named after Dr. Julian Davidson, founder of Davidson Technologies. The building opened January 31, 2008. The Davidson Center was designed to house the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and many other space exploration exhibits. The vehicle is elevated above the floor surface with separated stages and engines exposed, so visitors have the opportunity to walk underneath the rocket. The Davidson Center also features a 3D movie theater in addition to the planetarium in the original museum.

==Governance==
The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center is owned by the State of Alabama and operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission (ASSEC), whose 18 members are appointed by the Governor for terms of four or eight years. The composition and authority of the board are set forth in Title 41, Article 15 of the Code of Alabama. ASSEC meetings are open to the public.

The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center Foundation is a nonprofit organization that raises funds for the ASSEC.

==Visitors==
The Space &amp; Rocket Center saw 540,153 visitors in 2010 and 553,137 in 2011, and over 584,000 in 2013, the latter earning the museum recognition as the top paid-tourist attraction in Alabama. In 2017, more than 786,820 people visited the center, ranking it first among state attractions that charge admission, according to the Alabama Department of Tourism.

The NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, previously known as the Great Moonbuggy Race, has run every year since 1994, and all but the first two have been held at the Space &amp; Rocket Center. The race challenges high school and college students to design and build a small moonbuggy that they can assemble on-site and ride across a simulated lunar terrain.

==In popular culture==

The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center was the setting for feature films &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), &quot;Beyond the Stars&quot; (1989), and &quot;Space Warriors&quot; (2013), along with the 2012 made-for-TV movie &quot;A Smile as Big as the Moon&quot;.

The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center was the site of a Roadblock and Pit Stop at the end of Leg 3 of &quot;The Amazing Race: Family Edition&quot; aired in October 2005.

&quot;Good Morning America&quot; has featured the Space &amp; Rocket Center multiple times. In their 2006 proclamation the &quot;Seven wonders of America&quot;, GMA selected the Saturn V and particularly featured the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center.

<doc id="988976" wikidata="Q1186850" url="?curid=988976" title="Triple witching hour">
<text>Triple witching hour is the last hour of the stock market trading session (3:00–4:00p.m., New York time) on the third Friday of every March, June, September, and December. Those days are the expiration of three kinds of securities:
* Stock market index futures;
* Stock market index options;
* Stock options.

The simultaneous expirations generally increases the trading volume of options, futures, and their underlying stocks, occasionally increasing the volatility of prices of related securities.

On those same days single-stock futures also expire, so that the final hour is sometimes referred to as the quadruple witching hour.

==Concept and usage==
The term &quot;triple witching&quot; refers to the extra volatility resulting from the expiration dates of the three financing instruments, and is based on the &quot;witching hour&quot; denoting the active time for witches. 

It is used often and is considered industry jargon, along with the synonym, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;.

<doc id="988977" wikidata="Q1475124" url="?curid=988977" title="Furry Lewis">
<text>Walter E. &quot;Furry&quot; Lewis (March 6, 1893 or 1899 – September 14, 1981) was an American country blues guitarist and songwriter from Memphis, Tennessee. He was one of the earliest of the blues musicians active in the 1920s to be brought out of retirement and given new opportunities to record during the folk blues revival of the 1960s.

==Life and career==
Lewis was born in Greenwood, Mississippi. His birth year is uncertain. Many sources give 1893, the date he gave in his later years, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1899, based on his 1900 census entry, and other sources suggest 1895 or 1898. His family moved to Memphis when he was age 7. He acquired the nickname Furry from childhood playmates. By 1908, he was playing solo at parties, in taverns, and on the street. He was also invited to play several dates with W. C. Handy&#x27;s Orchestra.

In his travels as a musician, he was exposed to a wide variety of performers, including Bessie Smith, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Alger &quot;Texas&quot; Alexander. In 1916, Lewis lost a leg in an accident when trying to jump a freight train in the area around Du Quoin, Illinois, despite having enough cash to pay for a rail ticket. He spent a month in hospital at Carbondale, Illinois recovering, although it took him a year to adjust to his artificial leg and in the meantime he gave up his traveling lifestyle and returned to Memphis, where he performed on street corners. In 1922 he took a permanent position as a street sweeper for the city of Memphis, a job he held until his retirement in 1966, which allowed him to continue performing music in Memphis.

Lewis made his first recordings for Vocalion Records in Chicago in 1927. A year later, he recorded for Victor Records at the Memphis Auditorium in a session with the Memphis Jug Band, Jim Jackson, Frank Stokes, and others. He again recorded for Vocalion in Memphis in 1929. The tracks were mostly blues but included two-part versions of &quot;Casey Jones&quot; and &quot;John Henry&quot;. He sometimes fingerpicked and sometimes played with a slide. He made many successful records in the late 1920s, including &quot;Kassie Jones&quot;, &quot;Billy Lyons &amp; Stack-O-Lee&quot; and &quot;Judge Harsh Blues&quot; (later called &quot;Good Morning Judge&quot;).

On October 3, 1959, Sam Charters, with the assistance of his wife Ann Charters, recorded Furry in his rented room in Memphis, Tennessee. The recordings were released on a Folkways Records LP that same year. On April 3, 1961, Charters again recorded two albums of Furry Lewis - this time at the Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, for the Prestige / Bluesville imprint: &quot;Back on my Feet Again&quot; (BV 1036), and &quot;Done Changed my Mind&quot; (BV 1037). One track was included in Sam and Ann Charters&#x27; movie &quot;The Blues&quot;, finished in 1962, and finding wide release, after being lost for many years, in a 2020 package titled &quot;Searching for Secret Heroes&quot; by Document Records, thanks to producer Gary Atkinson.

In July 1968, Bob West recorded Furry Lewis along with Bukka White in Lewis&#x27;s Memphis apartment. In 1972, West, with Bob Graf, in Seattle, released the recording on a 12-inch vinyl record. In 2001 the recording was released on CD as &quot;Furry Lewis, Bukka White &amp; Friends, Party! at Home&quot;, by Arcola Records.

In 1969, the record producer Terry Manning recorded Lewis in his Fourth Street apartment in Memphis, near Beale Street. These recordings were released in Europe at the time by Barclay Records and again in the early 1990s by Lucky Seven Records in the United States and in 2006 by Universal Records.

In 1972, he was the featured performer in the Memphis Blues Caravan, which included Bukka White, Sleepy John Estes, Clarence Nelson, Hammie Nixon, Memphis Piano Red, Sam Chatmon, and Mose Vinson.

He opened twice for the Rolling Stones, performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, had a part in a Burt Reynolds movie (&quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot;, 1975), and was profiled in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;Furry Sings the Blues&quot; (on her album &quot;Hejira&quot;) is about her visit to Lewis&#x27;s apartment and a mostly ruined Beale Street on February 5, 1976. She wrote &quot;You bring him smoke and drink and he&#x27;ll play for you, It&#x27;s mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel, But there was one song he played
I could really feel&quot; Lewis hated the Mitchell song and said she should pay him royalties for being its subject.

Lewis began to lose his eyesight because of cataracts in his final years. He contracted pneumonia in 1981, which led to his death from heart failure in Memphis on September 14 of that year at age 88. He is buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in South Memphis, where his grave bears two headstones. The second, larger headstone, was purchased by fans.

<text>Antonis Nikopolidis (; born 14 January 1971) is a Greek professional football manager and former player.

He is regarded among the best Greek goalkeepers of all time having been awarded the most goalkeeper caps in the Greece national team and playing an integral part in the UEFA Euro 2004 triumph.

==Club career==

===Anagennisi Arta===
Nikopolidis made his first steps at his local team of Anagennisi Arta, from which he was transferred to Panathinaikos in the summer of 1989.

===Panathinaikos===
He made his debut during the 1990–91 season in a match against his future club, Olympiacos. In his early years as a Panathinaikos player, he was a back-up for Józef Wandzik. In 1995, he played five games as Panathinaikos won the championship and three as they retained it the following year. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1997–98 season that he established himself as the first choice goalkeeper at the age of 26. In the 2002 Champions league campaign, he helped the club reach the quarter-finals. In the 2003–04 season, he lost his place to Konstantinos Chalkias when his contract negotiations broke down.

Panathinaikos offered him €400K per year which, although a pay-rise, he thought was not in line with his contributions to the team over the past 15 years nor with his current market value. As he did not immediately accept the offer the management became suspicious and decided to relegate him to the bench for the rest of the 2003–04 season. The Greek sports media and Panathinaikos fans at first took his side in the conflict and criticised president Vardinogiannis.

Just before UEFA Euro 2004, rumours were circulating that Nikopolidis had been approached by arch-rivals Olympiacos. It was discovered later that he had signed an agreement just before the tournament begun earning him €600K per year for three years. After that, the fans&#x27; disappointment in him was displayed during the celebrations following the team&#x27;s 2003–04 season double when Nikopolidis, while raising the trophy, was booed by the majority of the crowd.

===Olympiacos===
Soon after being instrumental in UEFA Euro 2004 helping Greece to lift the trophy, Nikopolidis joined Olympiacos, making an immediate impact for his once rival team. Keeping a clean sheet in the first derby against his former club in the process, he went on to win two Doubles in a row, making him the only Greek player to win three consecutive doubles with two different clubs.

At his new team, Nikopolidis also earned a reputation for making game-winning saves in the most important games. Displaying his penalty-saving abilities, Nikopolidis saved three penalty kicks against Roma, Real Madrid, and Rosenborg BK, making him undefeated from the penalty spot in UEFA Champions League football in the Olympiacos shirt. In the 2007–08 season, he also equaled the Greek league record for the most penalty kicks saved in one season, which included saves against PAOK and former club Panathinaikos. Nikopolidis announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2009–10 season.

However, he took back his decision to stop his career after Sokratis Kokkalis&#x27;s insistence. The veteran goalkeeper stated that he would delay his retirement for one more year, to retire as champion. He signed an extension on 16 June that would keep him at Olympiacos for the 2010–11 season.

He also took part in the international match &quot;8th Match Against Poverty&quot;, on 14 December 2010, in Karaiskakis Stadium in Greece, as the UNDP team&#x27;s goalkeeper.

In January 2011, IFFHS released a list with the best goalkeepers of the first decade, and Nikopolidis was in. He was also listed as one of the best goalkeepers of the years 1987 to 2011.

On 20 March 2011, Olympiacos won the championship in a 6–0 win against rivals AEK Athens F.C., in Karaiskakis Stadium.

He made his final appearance on 17 April 2011 in a home 6–0 victory against Larissa F.C. in Karaiskakis Stadium. As a final curtain call, he was replaced by Balázs Megyeri in the last minutes, so he could wave goodbye to the Olympiacos fans.

As the Olympiacos captain, he was the player to accept the championship trophy, after the match.

==International career==
Nikopolidis made his debut for the Greece national football team on 18 August 1999 against El Salvador.

He played in the qualifying rounds of the 2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004 where he excelled as Greece qualified for the finals. Nikopolidis was one of the cornerstones of the Greek win in Portugal, where he kept three clean sheets in the knockout stages. He was also voted goalkeeper of the Euro 2004 All Star team.

On 15 June 2008, Nikopolidis announced his retirement from international football after Euro 2008, claiming that he had made this decision before the tournament started, and also stating that it is about time for a major change in the Greece national team.

==Managerial career==
After retirement, Nikopolidis became the assistant manager of Olympiacos in 2012.

He was promoted to manager in January 2013 on an interim basis following the dismissal of Leonardo Jardim. After the arrival of Míchel, he remained in the team as his assistant.

After the end of 2012–13 season, Nikopolidis left Olympiacos in order to start his career as a head coach.

On 1 October 2015, he was named as manager of the Greece national under-21 football team.

==Style of play==
Despite not being particularly tall or agile, his excellent positional sense made him an effective shot-stopper and his ability to read and understand the game helped him rush quickly off his line in order to face one on one situations or act as a sweeper-keeper.

<doc id="988989" wikidata="Q732975" url="?curid=988989" title="Munter hitch">
<text>The Munter hitch, also known as the Italian hitch, mezzo barcaiolo is a simple adjustable knot, commonly used by climbers, cavers, and rescuers to control friction in a life-lining or belay system. It is often mistakenly identified as the crossing hitch, however in the cross hitch the line does not return back along its original path.To climbers, this hitch is also known as HMS, the abbreviation for the German term , meaning &quot;half clove hitch belay&quot;. This technique can be used with a special &quot;pear-shaped&quot; HMS locking carabiner, or any locking carabiner wide enough to take two turns of the rope. 

In the late 1950s, three Italian climbers, Mario Bisaccia, Franco Garda and Pietro Gilardoni developed a new belay technique called the &quot;Mezzo Barcaiolo (MB) meaning; &quot;a half of the knot, which is used by the sailors to secure a boat to a bollard in a harbor.&quot; The &quot;MB&quot; came to be known as the Munter hitch after Werner Munter, a Swiss mountain guide popularized its use in mountaineering in the 1970s. This hitch was studied and then promoted for its use in the mountains (being officially recognized by the UIAA towards the end of the sixties), by the Italian Alpine Club and, in particular, by its Central Commission for Materials and Techniques.

The hitch is simply a set of wraps using a rope or cord around an object, generally a round object like a pipe, pole or more commonly, a carabiner. Its main use is as a friction device for controlling the rate of descent in belay systems.

==Method of operation==
The Munter hitch creates friction by having the rope rub on itself and on the object it has been wrapped around. There is no localized abrasion on any part of the rope as it is a continuously moving hitch. One very useful aspect of the Munter is its reversibility; it can be pulled from either side of the rope and it still works just as effectively. The Munter hitch is a self regulating hitch. The heavier the load the tighter the bends in the hitch become and therefore creating more friction and self regulating.

==Use for rappeling==
This hitch can be used to rappel or abseil down a vertical or semi-vertical wall, although it is not recommended as it causes severe twisting of the rope. Proper training should be undertaken before using the Munter hitch to rappel. Using this method to rappel is very hard on rope because of the rope on rope contact and is generally considered an emergency option only. 

===Use as load releasable tie off===
As with most belay devices and some hitches the Munter can be tied off (dogged/dogged off) to maintain tension in a manner which is easily released under tension, often referred to as a Munter-Mule-Overhand or MMO (Munter Mule Overhand)

The control rope (the rope not going to the load) is tied to the load rope with a mule knot (aka halter hitch)not a noose (slipped overhand)!and the bight (loop) that sticks out is tied in an overhand around the load rope. A carabiner is then sometimes clipped through the end of the bight and around the load rope.

Examples of when a tie off would be employed include:
* tensioning the line for use as a track line
* fall restraint line
* restraining/guying purposes.

When a belayer needs to transfer the load from their harness to the anchor to escape the system:
a rope grab (mechanical or friction knot/Prusik) is placed on the load line towards the load, rope is terminated on the rope grab (or the tails of accessory cord are used when using a cordelette with a Prusik as a rope grab) and runs back to the anchor where a Munter mule is tied under tension. The load can then be lowered (transferred) from the original belay onto the Munter Mule via the rope grab. The new line is often consider independent of the safety system so the original belay needs to be maintained throughout the process and secured back to the anchor before the system can be left unattended.

==Use as a belay==
A belay system incorporating the Munter hitch is the same as any other belay system, which incorporates a belayer to tend the rope and an anchor, which secures the belay system and belayer. 

There are several advantages to the Munter hitch. It requires no additional hardware other than a carabiner. It&#x27;s also the most common belay system which locks with the brake hand in line with the load, and as such is a more suitable method for direct belays than using a normal belay plate. This can be useful when the anchor, carabiner and Munter hitch are above or behind the belayer whilst attention is paid to the loaded end of the rope. It can also more effectively dissipate heat than a belay device because no two surfaces of the rope are in contact with each other for more than an instant. 

However, it places more bends in a rope than other belay methods, and creates significantly more friction on the outer sheath. Another disadvantage is that it can introduce significant twists to the rope. It is a versatile knot to know and can be used for full rope length vertical descents without the need for gloves.

The friction of the rope against the screw on the carabiner can cause the screw to undo and the carabiner to open, potentially weakening the strength of the carabiner, or allowing the rope to escape the carabiner completely. Therefore the hitch has to be tied correctly with the braking end on the opposite side of the carabiner than the gate is.

==Military use==
The Munter hitch is taught on Australian military roping courses as a simple and effective method for descending steep or overhanging terrain with combat equipment and can also be used for lowering heavy stores or casualties, the only equipment required being a harness or webbing seat, a locking carabiner, and a rope. 

==Arboreal usage==
For the recreational tree climber or working arborist, the Munter is useful to know as a reliable lowering knot for moderate loads. This hitch performs well on both 16 strand arborist climbing lines and the 11 mm double braid lines. 

==Tower technicians==
Tower technicians also use this knot for lowering loads, and tagging heavy loads while hoisting. It is commonly referred to in the tower industry as a tag knot.

<text>Emilie de Ravin (; born 27 December 1981) is an Australian actress. She first gained recognition for playing Tess Harding on The WB&#x27;s science fiction television series &quot;Roswell&quot; (2000–2002). She went on to portray Claire Littleton on the ABC drama series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2008, 2010), and Belle on the ABC fantasy adventure series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (2011–2018). De Ravin&#x27;s film credits include &quot;Santa&#x27;s Slay&quot; (2005), &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (2006) and &quot;Ball Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; (2008), &quot;Brick&quot; (2005), &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009) and &quot;Remember Me&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
De Ravin was born in Mount Eliza, Victoria, Australia, an outer southeastern suburb of Melbourne. She has French ancestry. Having studied ballet since the age of nine at Christa Cameron School of Ballet in Melbourne, and being home schooled by her mother, she was accepted into the Australian Ballet School at fifteen, where she performed in productions with The Australian Ballet as well as Danceworld 301.

She studied acting at Australia&#x27;s National Institute of Dramatic Art, and with the Prime Time Actors Studio in Los Angeles.

==Career==
De Ravin&#x27;s first major role was a recurring part as Curupira in the supernatural series &quot;Beastmaster&quot;. She went on to appear as alien/human hybrid Tess Harding in The WB&#x27;s teen television series, &quot;Roswell&quot; (2000–2002). She landed this role one month after moving to Los Angeles at the age of 18. &quot;E! Online&quot; described &quot;Roswell&quot; as &quot;one of the first shows to develop a passionate and engaged online fanbase, with active fan sites, message boards and even campaigns that helped save the show from cancellation—twice.&quot;

In 2004, de Ravin was cast to portray Claire Littleton on the ABC drama series &quot;Lost.&quot; Speaking about the success of &quot;Lost&quot;, she said: &quot;It&#x27;s sort of hard to say. You read something and have a good feeling about it, it sounds great, ties nicely together and then shooting something, editing it, the music, the actors involved, everything sort of plays a huge part. Everyone involved had a great feeling towards it, but you never really know.&quot; De Ravin&#x27;s character Claire is introduced in the pilot episode as a pregnant plane crash survivor. She is a series regular until her disappearance in the fourth season finale. The character returned as a regular in the sixth season. &quot;Lost&quot; has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC, while the final season averaged over 11 million U.S. viewers per episode.

In 2005, de Ravin was cast to portray Emily Kostich, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in the neo-noir film &quot;Brick&quot;. In an interview about the film, de Ravin told that she was attracted by the script because it was original and the teens in the film are very deep and emotional for their age.

A year later, de Ravin had a lead role and was cast as Brenda Carter in the remake of &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. The film performed well at the box office. In 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that she would be starring in the film &quot;Ball Don&#x27;t Lie,&quot; which premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, which arrived in cinemas early 2009. De Ravin appeared in William Dear&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Game&quot;, and appeared in the 2009 film &quot;Public Enemies&quot; as a bank teller named Barbara Patzke.

De Ravin was cast in the movie adaption of the video game &quot;Onimusha&quot;, but due to producer Samuel Hadida&#x27;s other project &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot;, and star Heath Ledger&#x27;s death, Hadida was forced to push back the release date of the film. &quot;Onimusha&quot; was postponed for an unknown amount of time and eventually cancelled; there was not any confirmation if de Ravin would continue the project. She portrayed Alyssa &quot;Ally&quot; Craig in the romantic drama film &quot;Remember Me&quot; (2010) opposite Robert Pattinson. The film received its wide release on 12 March 2010. &quot;Remember Me&quot; accumulated $56 million at the worldwide box office.

In 2012 she guest-starred as Belle on the ABC fantasy drama, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. After sporadic appearances in the first season, she was promoted to a series regular in the second. In May 2017, it was announced that de Ravin would be departing the series after six seasons along with her co-stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jared S. Gilmore and Rebecca Mader. Two months later, it was reported that de Ravin would be guest-starring in at least one episode of the series&#x27;s seventh season. That episode turned out to be the season&#x27;s fourth, &quot;Beauty&quot;. De Ravin also returned as Belle for the series finale, &quot;Leaving Storybrooke&quot;.

She was to star as Anthony LaPaglia&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter in the new drama series &quot;Americana&quot; in 2012, but ABC passed on the pilot. She starred in the 2015 indie film &quot;The Submarine Kid&quot;.

== Public image ==
During her career, de Ravin has appeared on the covers of numerous international fashion magazines, including US&#x27; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;InStyle Weddings&quot;, &quot;944&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Where&quot;, &quot;LA Baby&quot; and &quot;Giant;&quot; Finland&#x27;s &quot;Demi;&quot; Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Ciné Télé Revue&quot;; Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sunday&quot; and &quot;People&quot;; and UK&#x27;s &quot;Fabric&quot;. She has also modeled for &quot;CosmoGirl&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;BPM Culture.&quot; She has appeared in advertising campaigns for department store chain JCPenney and clothing brand Hanes. De Ravin has been included on &quot;Maxim&quot;″s Hot 100 list three times: in 2005 (No. 47), 2006 (No. 65), and 2008 (No. 68).

==Personal life==

After three years of dating, actor Josh Janowicz proposed to de Ravin on New Year&#x27;s Day 2003 in Melbourne, which she said &quot;was very impromptu and very sweet&quot;. She met Janowicz in Los Angeles, and said that &quot;our life together always comes before work. You can&#x27;t buy love or family.&quot; While filming &quot;Lost&quot;, de Ravin flew to and from Hawaii &quot;once or twice a week&quot; to return to her home in Burbank, California, which she shared with Janowicz and their poodle.

The couple married 19 June 2003 in Melbourne, Australia. They separated six months after they married, and then reconciled. In June 2009, it was reported that they were living separately and had filed for divorce. In October 2009, she called off the divorce after a trip to Japan with her husband. 

On 8 July 2014, de Ravin filed for divorce from Janowicz. According to court documents, the pair wed on 19 June 2003, despite their wedding ceremony on 26 June 2006; the documents further confirm that the couple separated on 1 November 2013.

In 2014, de Ravin began a relationship with American writer-director Eric Bilitch. The two announced their engagement on 6 July 2016. They have three children: two daughters, born in March 2016 and August 2023, and a son born in December 2018.

<text>Situated cognition is a theory that posits that knowing is inseparable from doing by arguing that all knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.

Situativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead, knowing exists &quot;in situ&quot;, inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual&#x27;s increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. 

==History==
While situated cognition gained recognition in the field of educational psychology in the late twentieth century, it shares many principles with older fields such as critical theory, anthropology (Jean Lave &amp; Etienne Wenger, 1991), philosophy (Martin Heidegger, 1968), critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1989), and sociolinguistics theories (Bakhtin, 1981) that rejected the notion of truly objective knowledge and the principles of Kantian empiricism.

Lucy Suchman&#x27;s work on situated action at Xerox Labs was instrumental in popularizing the idea that an actor&#x27;s understanding of how to perform work results from reflecting on interactions with the social and material (e.g. technology-mediated) situation in which she or he acts. More recent perspectives of situated cognition have focused on and draw from the concept of identity formation as people negotiate meaning through interactions within communities of practice. Situated cognition perspectives have been adopted in education, instructional design, online communities and artificial intelligence (see Brooks, Clancey). Grounded Cognition, concerned with the role of simulations and embodiment in cognition, encompasses Cognitive Linguistics, Situated Action, Simulation and Social Simulation theories. Research has contributed to the understanding of embodied language, memory, and the representation of knowledge.

Situated cognition draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior in the context of technology-mediated work, or within communities of practice to the ecological psychology of the perception-action cycle and intentional dynamics, and even research on robotics with work on autonomous agents at NASA and elsewhere (e.g., work by W. J. Clancey). Early attempts to define situated cognition focused on contrasting the emerging theory with information processing theories dominant in cognitive psychology.

Recently theorists have recognized a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and new literacies research (Gee, 2010). This connection is made by understanding that situated cognition maintains that individuals learn through experiences. It could be stated that these experiences, and more importantly the mediators that affect attention during these experiences is affected by the tools, technologies and languages used by a socio-cultural group and the meanings given to these by the collective group. New literacies research examines the context and contingencies that language and tool use by individuals and how this changes as the Internet and other communication technologies affect literacy.

==Key principles==
===Affordances/effectivities===
James J. Gibson introduced the idea of affordances as part of a relational account of perception. Perception should not be considered solely as the encoding of environmental features into the perceiver&#x27;s mind, but as an element of an individual&#x27;s interaction with her environment (Gibson, 1977). Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment. He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson 1979/1986&quot;&gt;Gibson 1979/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson focused on the affordances of physical objects, such as doorknobs and chairs, and suggested that these affordances were directly perceived by an individual instead of mediated by mental representations such as mental models. It is important to note that Gibson&#x27;s notion of direct perception as an unmediated process of noticing, perceiving, and encoding specific attributes from the environment, has long been challenged by proponents of a more category-based model of perception.

This focus on agent-situation interactions in ecological psychology was consistent with the situated cognition program of researchers such as James G. Greeno (1994, 1998), who appreciated Gibson&#x27;s apparent rejection of the factoring assumptions underlying experimental psychology. The situated cognition perspective focused on &quot;perception-action instead of memory and retrieval…A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact&quot;. Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are &quot;preconditions for activity,&quot; and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.

Shaw, Turvey, &amp; Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted &#x27;in the moment&#x27; together. Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman&#x27;s (1988) theory of &quot;perceived affordances,&quot; which emphasizes the agent&#x27;s perception of an object&#x27;s utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.

An interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as schemata and mental models, Glenberg &amp; Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.

===Perception (variance/invariance)===
The work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual perception greatly influences situated cognition. Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set), perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time.

===Memory===
Situated cognition and ecological psychology perspectives emphasize perception and propose that memory plays a significantly diminished role in the learning process. Rather, focus is on the continuous tuning of perceptions and actions across situations based on the affordances of the environment and the interaction of the agent within that environment (Greeno, 1994). Representations are not stored and checked against past knowledge, but are created and interpreted in activity (Clancey, 1990).

Situated cognition understands memory as an interaction with the world, bounded by meaningful situations, that brings an agent toward a specified goal (intention). Thus, perception and action are co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which act &#x27;in the moment&#x27; together. Therefore, the agent directly perceives and interacts with the environment, determining what affordances can be picked up, based on his effectivities, and does not simply recall stored symbolic representations.

===Knowing===
Situativity theorists recast knowledge not as an entity, thing, or noun, but as knowing as an action or verb. It is not an entity which can be collected as in knowledge acquisition models. Instead knowing is reciprocally co-determined between the agent and environment. This reciprocal interaction can not be separated from the context and its cultural and historical constructions. Therefore, knowing isn&#x27;t a matter of arriving at any single truth but instead it is a particular stance that emerges from the agent-environment interaction.

Knowing emerges as individuals develop intentions through goal-directed activities within cultural contexts which may in turn have larger goals and claims of truth. The adoption of intentions relates to the direction of the agent&#x27;s attention to the detection of affordances in the environment that will lead to accomplishment of desired goals. Knowing is expressed in the agent&#x27;s ability to act as an increasingly competent participant in a community of practice. As agents participate more fully within specific communities of practice, what constitutes knowing continuously evolves. For example, a novice environmentalist may not look at water quality by examining oxygen levels but may consider the color and smell. Through participation and enculturation within different communities, agents express knowing through action.

===Learning===
Since knowing is rooted in action and can not be decontextualized from individual, social, and historical goals teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for learning that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of effectivities and the development of attention and intention through rich contexts that reflect real life learning processes.

Learning, more specifically literacy learning is affected by the Internet and other communication technologies as also evidenced in other segments of society. As a result of this, youth are recently using affordances provided by these tools to become experts in a variety of domains. These practices by youth are viewed as them becoming &quot;pro-ams&quot; and becoming experts in whatever they have developed a passion for.

===Language===
Individuals don&#x27;t just read or write texts, they interact with them, and often these interactions involve others in various socio-cultural contexts. Since language is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge, and tool use in and out of school, the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and discourse use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts. Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice use of language by members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert. Originating from emergent literacy, specialist-language lessons examines the formal and informal styles and discourses of language use in socio-cultural contexts. A function of specialist-language lessons includes &quot;lucidly functional language&quot;, or complex specialist language is usually accompanied by clear and lucid language used to explain the rules, relationships or meanings existing between language and meaning.

===Legitimate peripheral participation===
According to Jean Lave and Wenger (1991) legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) provides a framework to describe how individuals (&#x27;newcomers&#x27;) become part of a community of learners. Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger&#x27;s take on situated cognition (referred to as &quot;situated activity&quot;) because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, &quot;Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and peripherality of participation in its historical realizations&quot; (p. 42). Lave and Wenger&#x27;s (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual&#x27;s multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.

To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and non-drinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning. Key to newcomers&#x27; success included:

* access to all that community membership entails,
* involvement in productive activity,
* learning the discourse(s) of the community including &quot;talking about and talking within a practice,&quot; (p. 109), and
* willingness of the community to capitalize on the inexperience of newcomers, &quot;Insofar as this continual interaction of new perspectives is sanctioned, everyone&#x27;s participation is legitimately peripheral in some respect. In other words, everyone can to some degree be considered a &#x27;newcomer&#x27; to the future of a changing community&quot; 

=== Planning vs. action ===
Suchman&#x27;s book, &quot;Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication&quot; (1987), provided a novel approach to the study of human-computer interaction (HCI). By adopting an anthropological approach to sensemaking and interpretation, Suchman was able to demonstrate how both action and planning were situated in the context of a flow of socially- and materially-mediated activities - an idea that stimulated many of the later conceptualizations of situated cognition. Her studies contrasted the deterministic approach to planning assumed by technology designers with the situated nature of planning as people make sense of the status of their workflow and adjust their course of action accordingly. For example, a photocopier will instruct its user to reload all pages in the original order after a jam, whereas the user understands that they only need to copy the last page again. By arguing that plans were the result of ongoing processes of prospective/retrospective sense making, Suchman identified the limits of technology system access to relevant social and material resources as a major cause of limitations in how technology supports human work.

This position led to a major debate with Vera and Simon (1993), who argued that cognition is based on symbolic representations and that planning must therefore be deterministic, based on a pre-determined repertoire of learned response. Most organizational theorists would now see this debate as reflecting individual/cognitive vs. socially-situated levels of analysis (requiring a similar need for paradigmatic co-existence as Wave–particle duality). Suchman (1993) argues that planning in the context of work-activity is similar to navigating a canoe through rapids: you know what point on the river you are aiming for, but you constantly adjust your course as you interact with rocks, swells, and currents on the way. As a result, many organizational theorists argue that plans can only be viewed as post-hoc justifications of action, while Suchman herself appears to view plans and actions as interrelated in the moment of action.

===Representation, symbols, and schemata===
In situated theories, the term &quot;representation&quot; refers to external forms in the environment that are created through social interactions to express meaning (language, art, gestures, etc.) and are perceived and acted upon in the first person sense. &quot;Representing&quot; in the first person sense is conceived as an act of re-experiencing in the imagination that involves the dialectic of ongoing perceiving and acting in coordination with the activation of neural structures and processes. This form of reflective representation is considered to be a secondary type of learning, while the primary form of learning is found in the &quot;adaptive recoordination that occurs with every behavior&quot;. Conceptualizing is considered to be a &quot;prelinguistic&quot; act, while &quot;knowing&quot; involves creative interaction with symbols in both their interpretation and use for expression. &quot;Schema&quot; develop as neural connections become biased through repeated activations to reactivate in situations that are perceived and conceived as temporally and compositionally similar to previous generalized situations.

===Goals, intention, and attention===
The Young-Barab Model (1997) pictured to the left, illustrates the dynamics of intentions and intentional dynamics involved in the agent&#x27;s interaction with his environment when problem solving.

Dynamics of Intentions: goal (intention) adoption from among all possible goals (ontological descent). This describes how the learner decides whether or not to adopt a particular goal when presented with a problem. Once a goal is adopted, the learner proceeds by interacting with their environment through intentional dynamics. There are many levels of intentions, but at the moment of a particular occasion, the agent has just one intention, and that intention constrains his behavior until it is fulfilled or annihilated.

Intentional Dynamics: dynamics that unfold when the agent has only one intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting. It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one&#x27;s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent of whether or not he is getting closer to achieving his goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent&#x27;s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he achieves his goal.

===Transfer===
There are various definition of transfer found within the situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation. Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations. Furthermore, transfer can only &quot;occur when there is a confluence of an individual&#x27;s goals and objectives, their acquired abilities to act, and a set of affordances for action&quot;.

===Embodied cognition===

The traditional cognition approach assumes that perception and motor systems are merely peripheral input and output devices. However, embodied cognition posits that the mind and body interact &#x27;on the fly&#x27; as a single entity. An example of embodied cognition is seen in the area of robotics, where movements are not based on internal representations, rather, they are based on the robot&#x27;s direct and immediate interaction with its environment. Additionally, research has shown that embodied facial expressions influence judgments, and arm movements are related to a person&#x27;s evaluation of a word or concept. In the latter example, the individual would pull or push a lever towards his name at a faster rate for positive words, than for negative words. These results appeal to the embodied nature of situated cognition, where knowledge is the achievement of the whole body in its interaction with the world.

==Externalism==
As to the mind, by and large, situated cognition paves the way to various form of externalism. The issue is whether the situated aspect of cognition has only a practical value or it is somehow constitutive of cognition and perhaps of consciousness itself. As to the latter possibility, there are different positions. David Chalmers and Andy Clark, who developed the hugely debated model of the extended mind, explicitly rejected the externalization of consciousness. For them, only cognition is extended. On the other hand, others, like Riccardo Manzotti or Teed Rockwell, explicitly considered the possibility to situate conscious experience in the environment.

==Pedagogical implications==
Since situated cognition views knowing as an action within specific contexts and views direct instruction models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, there are significant implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life. Second, curricular design should rely on contextual narratives that situate concepts in practice. Classroom practices such as project-based learning and problem-based learning would qualify as consistent with the situated learning perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, Anchored Instruction, and cognitive apprenticeship.

===Cognitive apprenticeship===
Cognitive apprenticeships were one of the earliest pedagogical designs to incorporate the theories of situated cognition (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship uses four dimensions (e.g., content, methods, sequence, sociology) to embed learning in activity and make deliberate the use of the social and physical contexts present in the classroom (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship includes the enculturation of students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). The technique draws on the principles of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and reciprocal teaching (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; 1989) in that a more knowledgeable other, i.e. a teacher, engages in a task with a more novice other, i.e. a learner, by describing their own thoughts as they work on the task, providing &quot;just in time&quot; scaffolding, modeling expert behaviors, and encouraging reflection. The reflection process includes having students alternate between novice and expert strategies in a problem-solving context, sensitizing them to specifics of an expert performance, and adjustments that may be made to their own performance to get them to the expert level (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Thus, the function of reflection indicates &quot;co-investigation&quot; and/or abstracted replay by students.

Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989) emphasized six critical features of a cognitive apprenticeship that included observation, coaching, scaffolding, modeling, fading, and reflection. Using these critical features, expert(s) guided students on their journey to acquire the cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills necessary to handle a variety of tasks, in a range of situations Reciprocal teaching, a form of cognitive apprenticeship, involves the modeling and coaching of various comprehension skills as teacher and students take turns in assuming the role of instructor.

===Anchored instruction===
Anchored instruction is grounded in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on the murder of a main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a &quot;generator set&quot; of situations.

The goal of anchored instruction is the engagement of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that require students to create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator&#x27;s objectives can be to set a goal through the use of an anchor problem. A classic example of anchored instruction is the Jasper series. The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.

===Perceiving and acting in avatar-based virtual worlds===
Virtual worlds provide unique affordances for embodied learning, i.e. hands on, interactive, spatially oriented, that ground learning in experience. Here &quot;embodied&quot; means acting in a virtual world enabled by an avatar.

Contextual affordances of online games and virtual environments allow learners to engage in goal-driven activity, authentic interactions, and collaborative problem-solving – all considered in situated theories of learning to be features of optimal learning. In terms of situated assessment, virtual worlds have the advantage of facilitating dynamic feedback that directs the perceiving/acting agent, through an avatar, to continually improve performance.

==Research methodologies==
The situative perspective is focused on interactive systems in which individuals interact with one another and physical and representational systems. Research takes place &quot;in situ&quot; and in real-world settings, reflecting assumptions that knowledge is constructed within specific contexts which have specific situational affordances. Mixed methods and qualitative methodologies are the most prominently used by researchers.

In qualitative studies, methods used are varied but the focus is often on the increased participation in specific communities of practice, the affordances of the environment that are acted upon by the agent, and the distributed nature of knowing in specific communities. A major feature of quantitative methods used in situated cognition is the absence of outcome measures. Quantitative variables used in mixed methods often focus on process over product. For example, trace nodes, dribble files, and hyperlink pathways are often used to track how students interact in the environment.

==Critiques of situativity==
In &quot;Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation&quot; Vera and Simon wrote: &quot; ... the systems usually regarded as exemplifying Situated Action are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks&quot; Vera and Simon (1993) also claimed that the information processing view is supported by many years of research in which symbol systems simulated &quot;broad areas of human cognition&quot; and that there is no evidence of cognition without representation.

Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) summarized what they considered to be the four claims of situated learning and argued against each claim from a cognitivist perspective. The claims and their arguments were:
# Claim: Activity and learning are bound to the specific situations in which they occur. Argument: Whether learning is bound to context or not depends on both the kind of learning and the way that it is learned.
# Claim: Knowledge does not transfer between tasks. Argument: There is ample evidence of successful transfer between tasks in the literature. Transfer depends on initial practice and the degree to which a successive task has similar cognitive elements to a prior task.
# Claim: Teaching abstractions is ineffective. Argument: Abstract instruction can be made effective by combining of abstract concepts and concrete examples.
# Claim: Instruction must happen in complex social contexts. Argument: Research shows value in individual learning and on focusing individually on specific skills in a skill set.

Anderson, Reder and Simons summarize their concerns when they say:
&quot;What is needed to improve learning and teaching is to continue to deepen our research into the circumstances that determine when narrower or broader contexts are required and when attention to narrower or broader skills are optimal for effective and efficient learning&quot; (p. 10).

===Considerations===
However, it is important to remember that a theory is neither wrong nor right but provides affordances for certain aspects of a problem. Lave and Wenger recognized this in their ironic comment, &quot;How can we purport to be working out a theoretical conception of learning without engaging in the project of abstraction [decontextualized knowledge] rejected above?&quot; (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p. 38).

<text>Grambling State University (GSU, Grambling, or Grambling State) is a public historically black university in Grambling, Louisiana, United States. Grambling State is home of the Eddie G. Robinson Museum and is listed on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. Grambling State is a member-school of the University of Louisiana System and Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

Grambling State&#x27;s athletic teams compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and are known as the Grambling State Tigers. Grambling State is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.

==History==

Grambling State University developed from the desire of African-American farmers in rural north Louisiana who wanted to educate other African Americans. In 1896, the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association led by Lafayette Richmond was formed to organize and operate a school. After opening a small school west of what is now the town of Grambling, the Association requested assistance from Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Charles P. Adams, sent to aid the group in organizing an industrial school, became its founder and first president.

Under Adams&#x27; leadership, the Colored Industrial and Agricultural School opened on November 1, 1901. Four years later, the school moved to its present location and was renamed as the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School. By 1928, the school was able to offer two-year professional certificates and diplomas after becoming a state junior college. The school was renamed Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute.

In 1936, the program was reorganized to emphasize rural education. It became known as &quot;The Louisiana Plan&quot; or &quot;A Venture in Rural Teacher Education&quot;. Professional teaching certificates were awarded when a third year was added in 1936, and the first baccalaureate degree was awarded in 1944 in elementary education. The institution&#x27;s name was changed to Grambling College in 1946 in honor of a white sawmill owner, P. G. Grambling, who donated a parcel of land for the school. Thereafter, the college prepared secondary teachers and added curricula in sciences, liberal arts and business. With these programs in effect, the school was transformed from a single purpose institution of teacher education into a multi-purpose college.

In 1949, the college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The Grambling science building is one of twenty-six public structures in Louisiana constructed by the prominent contractor George A. Caldwell.

In 1974, the addition of graduate programs in education allowed the college to be granted university status under its present name, Grambling State University.

From 1977 to 2000, the university grew and prospered. Several new academic programs were incorporated. New facilities were added to the campus, including a business and computer science building, school of nursing, student services building, stadium, stadium support facility, and an intramural sports center.

In May 1999, President Clinton served as the commencement keynote speaker.

State Representative George B. Holstead of Ruston worked to increase state appropriations for Grambling State University during his legislative tenure from 1964 to 1980.

On December 7, 2010, the Grambling State University Historic District, an area comprising 16 buildings dating from 1939 to 1960, was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2019, Grambling broke ground for building of the first digital library on a HBCU campus. The US$16.6 million project was completed in 2024.

<text>Dano-Mast (born 1996) is a thoroughbred racehorse, bought at the October 1997 sale for year old horses at Newmarket, England, for 10000 pounds. Dano-Mast did not race as a 2 year old, but showed talent when winning a maiden race by more than 20 lengths in his second appearance in a full season, which was later followed up by runner-up performances in both the Danish and Swedish Derby.

During the next three seasons Dano-Mast developed into a world-class performer, winning the Prix Jean de Chaudenay at Saint-Cloud and the Group 2 Prix Dollar at Longchamp, both racecourses situated in Paris. The horse made his career-best effort in the 2002 Hong Kong Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse, finishing third behind local hero Precision and German raider Paolini.

By the end of 2003, Dano-Mast was moved to France along with life-time companion trainer Flemming Poulsen, where he is still in training and occasional competition. A stud career awaits Dano-Mast once retired from the racing scene.

<text>A diving support vessel is a ship that is used as a floating base for professional diving projects. Basic requirements are the ability to keep station accurately and reliably throughout a diving operation, often in close proximity to drilling or production platforms, for positioning to degrade slowly enough in deteriorating conditions to recover divers without excessive risk, and to carry the necessary support equipment for the mode of diving to be used.

Recent offshore diving support vessels tend to be dynamically positioned (DP) and double as remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) support vessels, and also be capable of supporting seismic survey operations and cable-laying operations. DP makes a wider range of operations possible, but the platform presents some inherent hazards, particularly the thrusters, making launch and recovery by diving bell widespread. They may use a moonpool to shelter the position where the bell or ROV enters and exits the water, and the launch and recovery system may also use a bell cursor to constrain relative movement through the splash zone, and heave compensation to minimise depth variation of the bell during the dive. Accommodations must be provided for the teams supporting whichever functions the vessel is contracted for.

DSVs for operations tend to be much smaller, and may operate while moored for shallow work. operations are considered unacceptably hazardous for surface supplied diving unless a stage or bell is used to keep the divers&#x27; umbilicals clear of the vessel&#x27;s thrusters

== Description ==

A diving support vessel is a ship that is used as a floating base for professional diving projects. Basic requirements are the ability to keep station accurately and reliably throughout a diving operation, often in close proximity to drilling or production platforms, for positioning to degrade slowly enough in deteriorating conditions to recover divers without excessive risk, and to carry the necessary support equipment for the mode of diving to be used.

==History==
Commercial diving support vessels emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, when the need arose for offshore diving operations to be performed below and around oil production platforms and associated installations in open water in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Until that point, most diving operations were from mobile oil drilling platforms, pipe-lay, or crane barges. The diving system tended to be modularised and craned on and off the vessels as a package.

As permanent oil and gas production platforms emerged, the owners and operators were not keen to give over valuable deck space to diving systems because after they came on-line the expectation of continuing diving operations was low.

However, equipment fails or gets damaged, and there was a regular if not continuous need for diving operations in and around oil fields. The solution was to put diving packages on ships. Initially these tended to be oilfield supply ships or fishing vessels; however, keeping this kind of ship &#x27;on station&#x27;, particularly during uncertain weather, made the diving dangerous, problematic and seasonal. Furthermore, seabed operations usually entailed the raising and lowering of heavy equipment, and most such vessels were not equipped for this task.

This is when the dedicated commercial diving support vessel emerged. These were often built from scratch or heavily converted pipe carriers or other utility ships. The key components of the diving support vessel are:
* Dynamic Positioning – Controlled by a computer with input from position reference systems (DGPS, Transponders, Light Taut Wires or RadaScan), it will maintain the ship&#x27;s position over a dive site by using multi-directional thrusters, other sensors would compensate for swell, tide and prevailing wind.
* Saturation diving system – For diving operations below 50 m, a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) is required to eliminate the narcotic effect of nitrogen under pressure. For extended diving operations at depth, saturation diving is the preferred approach. A saturation system would be installed within the ship. A diving bell would transport the divers between the saturation system and the work site lowered through a &#x27;moon pool&#x27; in the bottom of the ship, usually with a support structure &#x27;cursor&#x27; to support the diving bell through the turbulent waters near the surface. There are a number of support systems for the saturation system on a diving support vessel, usually including a remotely operated vehicle ROV and heavy lifting equipment.

===Modern diving support vessels===

Most of the vessels currently in the North Sea have been built in the 1980s. The semi-submersible fleet, the Uncle John and similar, have proven to be too expensive to maintain and too slow to move between fields. Therefore, most existing designs are monohull vessels with either a one or a twin bell dive system. There has been little innovation since the 1980s. However, driven by high oil prices since 2004, the market for subsea developments in the North Sea has grown significantly. This has led to a scarcity of diving support vessels and has driven the price up. Thus, contractors have ordered a number of newbuild vessels which are expected to enter the market in 2008.

More recent vessels are designed and built to support both diving activities and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) operations with dedicated hangar and LARS for ROV&#x27;s, and to support seismic survey operations and cable-laying operations. They may carry 80 to 150 project personnel on board, including divers, diving supervisors and superintendents, dive technicians, life support technicians and supervisors, ROV pilots, ROV superintendents, survey team, clients personnel, etc. For all these personnel to carry out their contracted job with an oil and gas company, a professional crew navigate and operate the vessel according to the contract requirements and instructions of project superintendents. However, ultimate responsibility lies on the master of the vessel for the safety of every person on board. In expanding the utility of the vessel, these vessels provide, in addition to the usual domestic facilities, specialised diving mixed gas compressors and reclaim systems, gas storage and blending facilities, and saturation diving accommodation systems where the divers live under compression. These vessels are available to be hired by diving contractors or directly by oil and gas contractors who then will subcontract a specialist service-provider to use the vessel as a platform to carry out their activities.

==Special features==
===Dynamic positioning===

Dynamic positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled system to automatically maintain a vessel&#x27;s position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, motion sensors and gyrocompasses, provide information to the computer pertaining to the vessel&#x27;s position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Dynamic positioning is a great advantage for saturation diving operations as the risk to the divers and the work area from anchor patterns is reduced, and the vessel can be positioned more quickly.

===Saturation system===

The &quot;saturation system&quot;, &quot;saturation complex&quot; or &quot;saturation spread&quot; typically comprises a surface complex made up of a living chamber, transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber, which is commonly referred to in commercial diving and military diving as the diving bell, &quot;PTC&quot; (personnel transfer capsule) or &quot;SDC&quot; (submersible decompression chamber). The system can be permanently installed on the ship or can be capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. The entire system is managed from a control room (&quot;van&quot;), where depth, chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system tankage bulkhead by a trunking space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer to and from the bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at an average of to per day (schedules vary). The process involves only one decompression, thereby avoiding the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of in-water, staged decompression or sur-D O2 operations normally associated with non-saturation mixed gas diving. More than one living chamber can be linked to the transfer chamber through trunking so that diving teams can be stored at different depths where this is a logistical requirement. An extra chamber can be fitted to transfer personnel into and out of the system while under pressure and to treat divers for decompression sickness if this should be necessary.

The divers use surface supplied umbilical diving equipment, utilizing deep diving breathing gas, such as helium and oxygen mixtures, stored in large capacity, high pressure cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed to the control room, where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use.

While in the water the divers will often use a hot water suit to protect against the cold. The hot water comes from boilers on the surface and is pumped down to the diver via the bell&#x27;s umbilical and then through the diver&#x27;s umbilical.

The transfer chamber is where the bell is mated to the surface saturation system for transfer under pressure (TUP). It is a wet surface chamber where divers prepare for a dive and strip off and clean their gear after return. Connection to the bell may be overhead, through the bottom hatch of the bell, or lateral, through a side door.
The accommodation chambers may be as small as 100 square feet. This part is generally made of multiple compartments, including living, sanitation, and rest facilities, each a separate unit, joined by short lengths of cylindrical trunking. It is usually possible to isolate each compartment from the others using internal pressure doors.

===Diving bell===
A closed diving bell, also known as personnel transfer capsule or submersible decompression chamber, is used to transport divers between the workplace and the accommodations chambers. The bell is a cylindrical or spherical pressure vessel with a hatch at the bottom, and may mate with the surface transfer chamber at the bottom hatch or at a side door. Bells are usually designed to carry two or three divers, one of whom, the , stays inside the bell at the bottom and is to the working divers. Each diver is supplied by an umbilical from inside the bell. The bell has a set of high pressure gas storage cylinders mounted on the outside containing on-board reserve breathing gas. The on-board gas and main gas supply are distributed from the bell gas panel, which is controlled by the bellman. The bell may have viewports and external lights. The divers&#x27; umbilicals are stored on racks inside the bell during transfer, and are tended by the bellman during the dive.
The bell is deployed from a gantry or A-frame, also known as a bell launch and recovery system (LARS), on the vessel or platform, using a winch. Deployment may be over the side or through a moon pool.
* The handling system must be able to support the dynamic loads imposed by operating in a range of weather conditions.
* It must be able to move the bell through the air/water interface (splash zone) in a controlled way, fast enough to avoid excessive movement caused by wave action.
* A bell cursor may be used to limit lateral motion through and above the splash zone.
* It must keep the bell clear of the vessel or platform to prevent impact damage or injury.
* It must have sufficient power for fast retrieval of the bell in an emergency, and fine control to facilitate mating of the bell and transfer flange, and to accurately place the bell at the bottom.
* It must include a system to move the bell between the mating flange of the transfer chamber and the launch/retrieval position.
Diving bells are deployed over the side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame from which the clump weight and the bell are suspended. On dive support vessels with in-built saturation systems the bell may be deployed through a moon pool. The bell handling system is also known as the launch and recovery system (LARS). This is also used to move the bell from the position where it is locked on to the chamber system into the water, lower it to the working depth and hold it at that depth without excessive movement, for which heave compensation equipment may be fitted to the winch, and recover it to the chamber system. The system used to transfer the bell on deck may be a deck trolley system, an overhead gantry or a swinging A-frame. The system must constrain movement of the supported bell sufficiently to allow accurate location on the chamber trunking even in bad weather. A bell cursor may be used to control movement through and above the splash zone, and heave compensation gear may be used to limit vertical movement when in the water and clear of the cursor, particularly at working depth when the diver may be locked out and the bell is open to ambient pressure. gear may be useful to place the bell closer to the worksite if the ship cannot safely approach it to a convenient distance

===Moon pool===

A moon pool is an opening in the base of the hull, giving access to the water below, which allows divers, diving bells, remotely operated underwater vehicles or other equipment to enter or leave the water easily and in a relatively protected environment.
==Diving from a DSV==
Diving from a DSV makes a wider range of operations possible, but the platform presents some inherent hazards, and equipment and procedures must be adopted to manage these hazards as well as the hazards of the environment and diving tasks.

===Hazards===
* Hazards of the positioning system
** Anchor patterns
** Dynamic positioning thrusters
** Dynamic positioning runout
* Hazards of the 

===Equipment===

* On board recompression facilities or saturation system
* Equipment to transport the diver through high risk zones: Stages, wet and dry bells, bell cursors and launch and recovery systems.
* gear.
* Equipment to limit access to known hazards
* Hyperbaric evacuation facilities
* Breathing gas storage, gas blending, distribution and helium reclaim systems.
* Associated equipment:
** Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs)
** Rigging and lifting gear
** Tools and equipment for underwater work
** Tools and equipment for maintenance and repair of 
===Procedures===

Standard practices for diving from a DSV include the use of stages, wet and dry bells to transport the diver through the interface between air and water, to avoid hazards, and for decompression.

When using dynamic positioning, a surface supplied mode is used, and the length and routing of the diver&#x27;s umbilical is used to prevent the diver from closely approaching known high risk hazards like thrusters.

Underwater umbilical tending may be by passing the umbilical through the stage frame, tended from the surface, or from a bell, tended by the bellman. Additional underwater tending points may be needed, and one of the methods used is for the diver to pass through a heavy hoop, which may be deployed by crane to a specific position on or near the bottom, The reach of the umbilical beyond each tending point should not allow the diver close approach to known high risk hazards.

<doc id="989005" wikidata="Q7796091" url="?curid=989005" title="Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner">
<text>Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld IRS regulations limiting how taxpayers could write down inventory.

Thor manufactured equipment using multiple parts that it produced. It capitalized the costs of these parts when produced. When it had inventories of parts in excess of production needs, the company&#x27;s accounting practice was to write down those inventories, taking a loss based on management judgment.

However, IRS regulations accepted this &quot;lower of cost or market&quot; method for tax purposes only if the taxpayer could demonstrate a reduced market price, or the goods were defective or &quot;subnormal&quot;. It did not permit companies to write down goods simply because they were not selling them.

In court, the company argued that its deduction for loss should be allowed for tax purposes because it was permitted for accounting purposes. But the Court upheld the IRS regulations, saying, &quot;There is no presumption that an inventory practice conformable to &#x27;generally accepted accounting principles&#x27; is valid for tax purposes. Such a presumption is insupportable in light of the statute, this Court&#x27;s past decisions, and the differing objectives of tax and financial accounting.&quot;

==Effects==
The &quot;Thor&quot; decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell.

<text>Zubaida Jalal Khan (Urdu: زبيدہ جلال خان; born 31 August 1959), is a Pakistani politician, a teacher, libertarian and social activist, who served as the Defence Production Minister from August 2018 until April 2022.

After successfully contesting in general elections held in 2002 on a PML(Q) platform, she came in national prominence and public fame as a leading woman minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. From 2002 to 2007, she was the minister of education (MoEd) and unsuccessfully contested for general elections held in 2008 on a PML(Q) platform.

After a five-year brief break from the national politics, she joined the Pakistan Muslim League (N) but stepped down in favour of Kiran Haider, who successfully retained her seat in 2013 general elections, although she retains herself as a woman leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N).

==Social and political activism==

===Teachings and services to education===
After returning from Kuwait, she helped established a school for girls in her village with the support of her father because in that time in such traditional conservative Baloch society did not allowed women to go to schools. While teaching at school, she also taught English literature at the Balochistan University. In 1993, her services were recognised by the Government of Pakistan and honoured her with Pride of Performance Award for Education by the President of Pakistan. She has authored many publications include Papers on Baloch Embroidery and Poverty alleviation.

Her political activism started after joining the centre-right Pakistan Muslim League (PML) led by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1988; but defected to dissident group in 2000. She successfully contested in general elections held in 2002, securing 44,177 voted from her NA–27 constituency. In 2002, she was appointed as the minister of Minister of Education (MoEd) and took oath from President Pervez Musharraf as part of the Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali&#x27;s cabinet. She would later given extension and would continue served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.

===Education ministry===

In 2004, Zubaida Jalal announced that &quot;all religious seminaries will now be involved in all mainstream education programmes.&quot; Approved by President Pervez Musharraf, the programme was in making the madrassa (seminaries) integrated with modern education reforms. Jalal personally had approved the ₨. 225–500 million from the government for 2003–04; all funding were jointly released by the US AID. Reforms were set to be carried out to change the school curriculum and many revival updates, deregulation of the textbooks were part of the program which was oversaw by the Zubaida Jalal.

Despite initiation and modernisation, the programme did not move an inch, according to the media reports. The education ministry did not made no movement on seminary reforms and registration, with no related meetings scheduled and new no policy guidelines issued to government departments. In a media report published by &quot;Daily Times&quot;, the Education ministry failed in making the &quot;madrassa&quot; (seminaries) reforms successful in 2004. They asked the government to reopen &quot;madrassa&quot; registration for more people to benefit from the Madrassa Reforms Package. Approximately, ₨. 6 billion were set-aside for the reforms&#x27; first three years and the government gave an additional ₨. 225 million to four provinces, but the provinces failed to use the funds.

According to the officials worked under Zubaida Jalal&#x27;s administration confirmed that no new policy on madrassa reforms had been prepared and the old policy was still intact. In 2009, educationist, Saleem Ali wrote a thesis in his book, &quot;Islam and Education: Conflict and Conformity in Pakistan&#x27;s Madrassas&quot;, that &quot; indeed all private and public schools, are still subject to government approval, whereas the madrassa programmes at present have no government oversight.&quot; The government&#x27;s inability to impose the program and lack of interest in topics further diminished. The powerful clerics threatened the government upon which the federal education minister Zubaida Jalal immediately clarified that no chapter or verses relating to jihad or Holy War or shahadat (martyrdom) had been deleted from textbook and that the particular verse referring to jihad had only been shifted from the biology textbook for intermediate students.

According to the Education ministry, the major reason for this failure was the view of the madrassas that the project was part of an American agenda. Others maintained that there were &quot;high level interests&quot; which had hampered the process. Furthermore, majority of the funds were lost during a tug of war between the Interior ministry, Religious ministry and Education ministry which Zubaida Jalal led. This squabble was eventually resolved by a personal intervention of President Pervez Musharraf in 2007.

===2008 general election campaign===

In 2008, Jalal decided not to obtain the PML(Q) ticket, and instead contested in 2008 general elections as an independent candidate, from the NA–272 constituency. She lost the 2008 general election while securing only 33,564 votes and losing to Yaqoob Bizanjo of Balochistan National Party (Awami).

===2013 general election===

In 2013, Zubaida Jalal endorsed PML(N) candidate Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s bid for premiership. In a meeting with Nawaz Sharif, Jalal announced to join the PML-N, reposing full confidence in the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.

===2018 general election===

Zubaida Jalal Joined BAP and successfully contested the elections. Following the PTI government coalition with BAP, she was nominated as the BAP representative in the Federal Cabinet. She was inducted as Minister for Defence Production on 20 August 2018. After the success of the No-confidence motion against Imran Khan Cabinet was dissolved and she resigned alongside Imran Khan from the ministry.

==Personal life==

===Political controversies===

Soon after the general elections in 2008, the FIA launched an investigation on Zubaida Jalal over the financial scam. The FIA investigations were launched under the directives of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani who felt that &quot;the role of the minister of that time Zubaida Jalal needs to be investigated without which the objectives of the whole exercise will remain unmet.&quot; Zubaida Jalal has strongly denied the allegations of corruption against her. In 2009, the FIA investigations were wrapped.

In 2010 publications edited by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDT), Zubaida Jalal is a second richest politician from Balochistan, having declared the total assets worth ₨. 57.87
million.

===Political philosophy===

Zubaida Jalal was touted as General Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s most enlightened face and was one of the notable minister under Musharraf&#x27;s regime. In 2008, she publicly endorsed the support for President Pervez Musharraf during the times of impeachment movement was in effect against the former president. In a television interview, Zubaida Jalal said that as a bold and brave leader, Pervez Musharraf will live in Pakistan and for Pakistan. While talking to APP this afternoon after the Pervez Musharraf announced his resignation, Begum Jalal said that to the extent she knows Musharraf, he is not likely to leave the field empty but will continue his struggle for an enlightened, peaceful and progressive Pakistan.

She has strongly advocated for the support of liberal philosophy, &quot;Enlightened Moderation&quot; and noted that &quot;Extremism is a barrier to development and an enlightened moderation is the key to globalization.&quot;
