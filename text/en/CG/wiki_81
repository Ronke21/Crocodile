<text>Boys Don&#x27;t Cry are a British pop/rock band known for the hit single &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1986 and charted around the world.

==Biography==
The band was formed in 1983 as the brainchild of lead vocalist/keyboardist Nick Richards, who had just purchased Maison Rouge Recording Studios in London. An early version of the group (featuring Richards, guitarist Richard Taee and drummer Steve Creese, augmented by session musicians) released their debut EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot; on independent UK label Legacy Records in Britain in 1983. By the mid-1980s, the band&#x27;s line-up had stabilised around principal members Richards and keyboardist Brian Chatton (one of the session players on the debut EP), along with Jeff Seopardi on drums, Nico Ramsden on guitar, and Mark Smith on bass. Chatton previously played keyboards with 1970s progressive band Jackson Heights, contributing heavily to their last three albums, &quot;The Fifth Avenue Bus&quot; in 1972, &quot;Ragamuffin&#x27;s Fool&quot; published the same year and &quot;Bump &#x27;n&#x27; Grind&quot; in 1973.

Boys Don&#x27;t Cry were discovered by Paul Oakenfold, who was a talent scout for Profile Records in London in the mid-&#x27;80s. Best known for being Run-DMC&#x27;s record label at the time, Profile signed the band for the US market and Legacy retained the rights to the band&#x27;s UK releases. Mercury Records won the bidding for Canada and Intercord Tonträger GmbH handled their releases in Germany.

The single &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot; was released in 1986. A novelty song with deadpan humour and kitschy references, the song has been described as the perfect musical realisation of a Spaghetti Western movie. It hit No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 13 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart in 1986–1987, and was R&amp;R No. 8. &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot; was also a top 10 hit in Australia and South Africa. The video, filmed on-location in Hampstead Heath, featured a cameo appearance by Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead.

They would go on to release two full-length albums: a self-titled debut in 1986, which included &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot;, and a follow-up the following year titled &quot;Who the Am Dam Do You Think We Am&quot;. The second album was simply released in America as &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, creating some confusion there, since the band now had two consecutive self-titled albums released within a year of each other. The follow-up single to &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot; was (necessarily perhaps) a complete departure; &quot;Cities On Fire&quot;, an energetic rush of synth-rock which was released in 7&quot; and 12&quot; remix form, received early attention from MTV but failed to connect with fans of the novelty hit and didn&#x27;t receive enough airplay to create a new fanbase.

In 1991 &quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&quot; was featured in the night club scene in the film &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;.

On 30 July 1997, co-writers Nick Richards and Brian Chatton sued Paula Cole, Warner Brothers Records, and Imago Records, along with remix producers DJ EFX, Big Ed, and the E-Team, for $7 million in the US District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that Cole&#x27;s remix of &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot; used the phrase &quot;I wanna be a cowboy&quot; 24 times in the same style and syntax as their song and constituted copyright infringement.

==Origin of name==
Contrary to popular belief, the moniker &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; did not come from The Cure&#x27;s song/album of the same name. Rather, the name has its origins in some whispered lyrics from fellow British band 10cc&#x27;s hit song &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; (specifically, &quot;be quiet... big boys don&#x27;t cry&quot;). However, the band were evidently completely aware of (and perhaps amused by) the confusion surrounding their name, and they even included an (almost-entirely) instrumental bonus track titled &quot;The Cure&quot; on their second album as a joke.

==Recent times==
In 2009, Nick Richards and Brian Chatton teamed up again in Los Angeles to write an album. The first single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me a Country Singer&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the FMQB a/c radio charts. Richards put together a new Boys Don&#x27;t Cry line-up, featuring Doug Gild on bass, Mike Licata on drums, Aaron McClain and James Richards on guitars, and Teddy Rae Richards on backing vocals. Barbara Baker has taken over the management. This incarnation later planned to tour with Red Entertainment on an &quot;Eighties Retro&quot; tour.

On 2 November 2009, the band&#x27;s former bass player, Mark Smith, died at his home in London. Mark was just 49 years old, and he had originally been tapped to join the band for the following year&#x27;s touring.

The band played a New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Hollywood with special guest stars including Roy Hay from Culture Club and Nina Hagen. They have also released a brand new 6-track EP entitled &quot;Blow Me&quot;, which is only available as a download.

Boys Don&#x27;t Cry released a brand new album, &quot;Hear It Is!&quot;, on 14 August 2014. The songs were penned by original members Nick Richards and Brian Chatton. The album is on Richards&#x27; own label Microrich, Inc.

===2020: Greatest Hits album, re-releases, and new music===
In late April 2020, Boys Don&#x27;t Cry announced the release of a new Greatest Hits album titled &quot;All the Very Best&quot;. This compilation spans the band&#x27;s entire career to date, including songs from their first two full-length albums and later material.

Shortly thereafter, Nick Richards announced that the band was re-releasing their entire back catalogue, including the band&#x27;s 1983 debut EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;, both of their full-length 1980s albums, and &quot;Hear It Is!&quot;, along with a new album of outtakes and new/unreleased tracks titled &quot;Odds and Sods&quot;. (One apparent exception, the early single, &quot;Who Said It?&quot;, also featured on the original 1983 EP, did not appear among the re-released material.)

On 26 September 2020, the band released the single, &quot;Harem Shuffle,&quot; a song that had originally appeared on &quot;Hear It Is!&quot;. The tune has since received airplay on such stations as Sirius XM&#x27;s &quot;1st Wave&quot;.

<text>Flamsteed is a small lunar impact crater located on the Oceanus Procellarum, which is named after British astronomer John Flamsteed. It lies almost due east of the dark-hued Grimaldi, and north-northwest of the flooded Letronne bay on the south edge of the mare.
The rim of this crater is not circular in form, having a bulging rim to the southeast. The interior is relatively flat and undistinguished by impacts. The crater lies within the southern rim of a crater that has been almost completely submerged by the basaltic lava flows that formed the Oceanus Procellarum. All that remains of this feature designated Flamsteed P are some low ridges and hills arranged in a circular formation.

Flamsteed is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

The Surveyor 1 craft landed within the northeast rim of the buried Flamsteed P feature, about 50 kilometers north-northeast of the Flamsteed crater rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Flamsteed.

<doc id="999594" wikidata="Q759873" url="?curid=999594" title="Taxodium ascendens">
<text>Taxodium ascendens, also known as pond cypress, is a deciduous conifer of the genus &quot;Taxodium&quot;, native to North America. Many botanists treat it as a variety of bald cypress, &quot;Taxodium distichum&quot; (as &quot;T. distichum&quot; var. &quot;imbricatum&quot;) rather than as a distinct species, but it differs in habitat, occurring mainly in still blackwater rivers, ponds and swamps without silt-rich flood deposits. It predominates in cypress dome habitats.

==Description==

&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; is classified as a perennial gymnosperm that is native to the southeastern United States.&quot; Taxodium ascendens&quot; reaches on average in height. Pond cypress are typically between 50 – 85 ft tall and 15–30 ft wide. Compared to &quot;T. distichum&quot;, the leaves are shorter (3–10 mm long), slenderer and are on shoots that tend to be erect rather than spreading. The trunk is expanded at the base, even on young trees, assisting the tree in anchoring in the soft, muddy soil. The cones also tend to be smaller, not over 2.5 cm diameter. The pond cypress leaves are more needle-shaped (like the shaft of an awl or a screwdriver), in a spiral arrangement that stays close to the stem. The leaves are deciduous, simple, alternate, awl-like needles. Its cones are round, ovulate, between long. The bark is also a paler gray color. Cypresses are known for their prominent &quot;knees&quot; and buttressed trunks that define the species however &quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; is less likely to have &quot;knees&quot; than &quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;. Like bald cypresses, pond cypresses growing in water have a characteristic growth trait called cypress knees; these are woody projections called &#x27;pneumatophores&#x27;, which are sent above the water from the roots.Due to the dry nature of the habitat for the pond cypress, it has developed thicker, fire resistant bark.

==Distribution==
This species is native to the southeastern United States, from southeastern Virginia to southeastern Louisiana and south into Florida except for the Florida Keys. Stunted individuals of pond cypress are notable in the dwarf cypress savanna of the Everglades National Park. &quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; is most frequently found in the southeastern United States ranging from Virginia to Louisiana.

==Habitat==

&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; occurs naturally in shallow ponds, lake margins, swamps and wetlands. It prefers wet, poorly drained and acidic soils, at an altitude of above sea level. The pond cypress preferred habitat is along the banks of ponds and lakes where the water is stagnant. This tree is native to southern swamps, bayous and rivers, and is known to tolerate extended periods of intense flooding. Pond cypress are most frequently found in isolated depressions fed by nutrient poor, shallow ground water. &quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; grows easily in average, medium to wet, moisture-retentive but reasonably well-drained soils in full sun. It prefers moist, acidic, sandy soils, but tolerates a wide range of soil conditions ranging from average moisture soils to wet soils in standing water.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; was discovered and identified by botanist Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart in 1833. The pond cypress is also known by other synonyms &quot;&quot;Taxodium&quot; &quot;distichum&quot; var. &quot;imbricatum&quot; (Nutt.) Croom&quot; and &quot;&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot; var. &quot;ascendens&quot; (Brongn.) Mast.&quot;

== Uses ==
&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; is typically used for ornamental purposes or decoration in more urban environments unlike the bald cypress which can be used in heavy duty construction. Pond cypress are also used in wetland restoration and enhancement.

== Ecology ==
Like many other large semiaquatic plants, &quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; roots and trunk provides structural complexity to shelter to young aquatic animals such as the larvae of amphibians and juvenile fish. Specifically the endangered flatwoods salamander will only lay their eggs in dry ponds populated with &quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot;.

&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot; is susceptible to fires during the drier arid seasons where ponds lose the majority of their water but these trees have developed a thicker bark to better survive these conditions.

== Etymology ==
The varietal name &quot;imbricatum&quot; means overlapping, in reference to the manner in which the leaves lie on the twigs. The term “ascendens” suggests the leaves that point or grow upward in an arching or curving fashion.

== Conservation status ==
The pond cypress is considered &quot;apparently secure&quot; (S4) in North Carolina, &quot;critically imperiled&quot; (S1) in Virginia, and &quot;exotic&quot; in Delaware.

<text>Taxodium mucronatum, commonly known as Montezuma bald cypress, Montezuma cypress, or ahuehuete, is a species of &quot;Taxodium&quot; that is primarily native to Mexico and Guatemala, with a few populations in the southwestern United States. Ahuehuete is derived from the Nahuatl name for the tree, āhuēhuētl, which means &quot;upright drum in water&quot; or &quot;old man of the water.&quot;

==Description==
It is a large evergreen or semi-evergreen tree growing to tall and with a trunk of diameter (occasionally much more; see below). The leaves are spirally arranged but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, long and broad. The cones are ovoid, long and broad.
Unlike bald cypress and pond cypress, Montezuma cypress rarely produces cypress knees from the roots. Trees from the Mexican highlands achieve a notable stoutness.

One specimen, the Árbol del Tule in Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the stoutest tree in the world with a diameter of . Several other specimens from diameter are known. The second stoutest tree in the world is the Big Baobab, an African baobab.

==Distribution and habitat==

Montezuma cypress is primarily a riparian tree, growing along upland riversides, but can also be found next to springs and marshes. It occurs from , in Mexico mainly in highlands at in altitude. &quot;T. mucronatum&quot; is very drought-tolerant and fast-growing and favors climates that are rainy throughout the year or at least with high summer rainfall.

&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot; is native to much of Mexico as far south as the highlands of southern Mexico. Two disjunct populations exist in the United States. One is in the Rio Grande Valley of southernmost Texas, while the other is in southern New Mexico, near Las Cruces. Within Guatemala, the tree is restricted to Huehuetenango Department.

==Culture==

The sabino became the national tree of Mexico in 1910. The tree is sacred to the native peoples of Mexico, and is featured in the Zapotec creation myth. To the Aztecs, the combined shade of an &quot;āhuēhuētl&quot; and a &quot;pōchōtl&quot; (&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;) metaphorically represented a ruler&#x27;s authority. According to legend, Hernán Cortés wept under an ahuehuete in Popotla after suffering defeat during the Battle of La Noche Triste.

This plant is mentioned in the 2015 short story &quot;Rivers&quot; by John Keene, which reimagines the story of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

==Uses==
Montezuma cypresses have been used as ornamental trees since Pre-Columbian times. The Aztecs planted &quot;āhuēhuētl&quot; along processional paths in the gardens of Chapultepec because of its association with government. Artificial islands called &quot;chinampas&quot; were formed in the shallow lakes of the Valley of Mexico by adding soil to rectangular areas enclosed by trees such as &quot;āhuēhuētl&quot;; they also lined the region&#x27;s canals prior to Spanish conquest.

Ahuehuetes are frequently cultivated in Mexican parks and gardens. The wood is used to make house beams and furniture. The Aztecs used its resin to treat gout, ulcers, skin diseases, wounds, and toothaches. A decoction made from the bark was used as a diuretic and an emmenagogue. Pitch derived from the wood was used as a cure for bronchitis The leaves acted as a relaxant and could help reduce itching. In some parts of Mexico the foliage is used to decorate church altars during religious ceremonies.

John Naka, a bonsai master, donated his very first bonsai, a Montezuma cypress, to the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum of the United States. 

A linear grove is located in the main courtyard of the Getty Center Art Museum, thriving since 1995.

<text>Thomas Baker Slick Jr. (May 6, 1916 – October 6, 1962) was a San Antonio, Texas-based inventor, businessman, adventurer, and heir to an oil business. Slick&#x27;s father, Thomas Baker Slick Sr., a.k.a. &quot;The King of the Wildcatters&quot;, had made a fortune during the Oklahoma oil boom of the 1910s. He was notable for discovering Oklahoma&#x27;s then-largest oil field, the Cushing Oil Field.

==Career==

During the 1950s, Slick was an adventurer. He turned his attention to expeditions to investigate the Loch Ness Monster, the Yeti, Bigfoot and the Trinity Alps giant salamander. Slick&#x27;s interest in cryptozoology was little known until the 1989 publication of the biography &quot;Tom Slick and the Search for Yeti&quot;, by Loren Coleman. Coleman continued his study of Slick in 2002 with &quot;Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology&quot;. That book mentions many of Slick&#x27;s adventures, in politics, art, science, and cryptozoology, including his involvement with the CIA and Howard Hughes.

Slick was a friend of many celebrities, including Hughes and fellow flier Jimmy Stewart. Stewart, for example, assisted a Slick-backed expedition in smuggling a piece of the Pangboche Yeti hand back to England for scientific analysis, Loren Coleman was to discover from Slick&#x27;s files and confirmation from Stewart before his death.

Slick founded several research organizations, beginning with the forerunner of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in 1941. His most well-known legacy is the non-profit Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), which he founded in 1947 to seek revolutionary advancements in technology. SwRI continues to advance pure and applied science in a variety of fields from lubricant and motor fuel formulation to solar physics and planetary science. He also founded the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio in 1958 to do consciousness research.

Tom assisted his brother, Earl F. Slick, in founding Slick Airways, one of the first US scheduled freight airlines.

In 1955 he was awarded a patent for the lift slab method of constructing concrete buildings.

He was an advocate of world peace. In 1958 he published the book, &quot;Permanent Peace: A Check and Balance Plan&quot;. He funded the Tom Slick World Peace lectures at the LBJ Library, and the Tom Slick Professorship of World Peace at the University of Texas.

Nicolas Cage was to have portrayed Slick in a movie, &quot;Tom Slick: Monster Hunter&quot;, but the project stalled.

==Art collection==
Slick was an avid collector of modern art. His collection was surveyed by the McNay Art Museum with an exhibition and catalogue titled &quot;Tom Slick: International Art Collector&quot;.

==Death==
On October 6, 1962, Slick was returning from a Canadian hunting trip when his airplane crashed in Montana. Reportedly, the aircraft disintegrated in flight. A wing broke off in violent wind shear over the mountains.

<text>Crocodile [[Armour (anatomy)|armor]] consists of the protective dermal and epidermal components of the integumentary system in animals of the order Crocodilia.

==Structure and anatomy==
The epidermal scutes of the alligator consists of oblong horny scales, arranged in transverse rows; the long axes of the scales are parallel to that of the body. On the tail, except along the mid-dorsal line, and on the ventral side of the trunk and head these scales are very regular in outline and arrangement; on the sides of the head and trunk and on the legs they are much smaller and less regularly arranged, while along the mid-dorsal line of the tail, especially in its posterior half, they are elevated into tall keels that give the tail a large surface area for swimming. The first three digits of both manus (fore foot) and pes (hind foot) are armed with horny claws, which also belong to the epidermal part of the exoskeleton.

The dermal exoskeleton consists of bony scutes known as osteoderms that underlie the epidermal scales of the dorsal surface of the trunk and anterior part of the tail. The overlying scales, except in very young animals, are always rubbed off, so that the bony scales are exposed. The ventral or inner surface of the scutes is flat, while the outer surface is strongly keeled and in old animals is often rough and pitted. The plates are nearly square in outline and are closely joined together in most places.

The scutes are grouped in two fairly distinct areas known as the nuchal and the dorsal shields. The former lies just back of the head, in the region of the fore legs, and consists of four larger and a number of smaller plates. The latter, or dorsal shield, extends over the back in fairly regular longitudinal rows and quite regular transverse rows. At the widest part of the trunk there are six or eight of these scutes in one transverse row. They become smaller towards the tail.

The teeth are exoskeletal structures, partly of ectodermal, partly of dermal origin. They are conical in shape, without roots, and are replaced when lost. They will be described in connection with the skull.

Musk glands, said by Gadow to be present in all Crocodilia, are found in both sexes and are derivations of the skin. One pair, each of which may be as large as a walnut, is found on the lower side of the head, one on the inside of each half of the mandible. The other pair is inside of the lips of the cloaca.

==Histology of the integument==
The epidermis of an embryo, young, or half-grown Crocodilia contains the &quot;rete Malpighii&quot;: a single layer of short, cylindrical cells. Over the rete are somewhat flattened, disk-shaped cells formed by transverse division of the underlying rete cells. On the outside lies the &quot;epitrichial layer&quot;, a mosaic of polygonal cells each with an oval nucleus near its middle. Between the epitrichial cells are small oval holes, not unlike the stomata in the epidermis of plant tissues. Bronn thinks these are not artifacts, but he does not suggest any explanation of their occurrence.

On the short, cylindrical rete Malpighii cells are flattened cells that gradually become very flat and lose their nuclei as they pass over into the horny layer.
The stratum corneum consists of strongly flattened cells in which the nuclei can no
longer be clearly seen, though their location can usually be determined by the groups of pigment granules. On the cells of the more superficial layers of the stratum corneum are straight, dark lines, perhaps ridges caused by pressure of the over- or underlying polygonal cells. The individual cells of the horny layer are usually easily isolated in the belly and neck regions where they never become very thick; but in the back the cells in this layer are very numerous and fuse with each other to form the bony plates; here the rete is the only clearly differentiated layer. Whether prickle cells are present in the epidermis of the crocodile Bronn is not certain, though he thinks they probably are.

Rathke pointed out that on the surface of certain folds of the integument, especially in the region of the jaws, are found in all Crocodilia certain small, scattered, wart-like elevations, around each of which is customarily a narrow, shallow, circular groove; they usually have a dark brown but sometimes a gray or even white color. Microscopic examination shows these warts to be of epidermal origin, consisting of bright, round cells that are closely united, without visible intercellular substance. Treatment with potassium hydroxide and then with water will show sometimes, though not always, fine granular nuclei in the cells. In probably all members of the genus Crocodilus, at least is found, on the thick
swelling on the right and on the left side of the neck and trunk, a small, flat pit which has the appearance of the opening of an integumental gland. The pits are present also in the scales of the throat, under the side of the neck, sides of the body, lateral and ventral surfaces of the anterior half of the tail, and the legs. They are near the hinder border of the scales. Only occasionally are two pits found in one scale. These pits are found in the gavials but are absent in some, probably all, alligators. A small knob projects from the center of some of the pits. These pits are not openings of glands but have about the same structure as the pits seen in the head.

The integumental bones in the Crocodilia originate in the connective tissue of the cutis. Investigations in young animals show that these bones usually take their origin in the under and middle layers of the cutis and generally work towards the periphery.

<doc id="999611" wikidata="Q977198" url="?curid=999611" title="Furnerius (crater)">
<text>Furnerius is a large lunar impact crater located in the southeast part of the Moon, in the area close to the southeastern limb of the nearside or visible Moon. Because of its location, the crater appears oval in shape due to foreshortening but is actually nearly circular. Notable nearby craters include Stevinus to the northwest and Fraunhofer to the south-southwest. Farther to the northwest is the crater Snellius and the Vallis Snellius crater valley.

The rim of Furnerius is worn and battered, with multiple impacts along its length and notches along the base. Much of the wall now rises only slightly above the surrounding terrain, with the lowest sections to the north and south. However the northern wall rises to a maximum elevation of 3.5 km.

The interior floor is marked by fourteen notable craters, the most notable being Furnerius B in the northern half which has a central rise. Dark patches on the floor indicate areas resurfaced by lava. In the northeast part of the floor is a rille designated Rima Furnerius. This cleft is about 50 kilometers in length and follows a course to the northwest where it reaches the north rim of the crater.

In Johann H. Schröter&#x27;s lunar study of 1791, he sketched this crater with a low dome in the southern half. This feature has proven difficult to identify in subsequent lunar photographs and observations.

The Japanese satellite named Hiten crash-landed in the vicinity of this crater in 1993.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Furnerius.

<text>Communist Party of Indian Union (Marxist–Leninist) was an Indian political party. CPIU (ML) traced its origins to a small group that broke away from the Communist Organization of India (Marxist-Leninist) of Kanu Sanyal and joined Marxist Communist Party of India. The merger between CPIU and MCPI took place at a conference in Chandigarh on 11 September 1998. At the time of the merger, the general secretary of CPIU was U. Krishanuppa from Karnataka.

Later, CPIU (ML) broke away from MCPI. CPIU (ML) was mainly based in Bihar and West Bengal.

In August 2003 discussions took place between Kanu Sanyal and Arvind Sinha from CPI (ML) and Subodh Mitra and S.D. Bose about a possible merger between CPIU (ML) and CPI (ML). The conference of CPIU (ML) in Samastipur 18 November 2003 confirmed the merger plans, and CPIU (ML) joined the CPI (ML) of Sanyal.

<doc id="999617" wikidata="Q424200" url="?curid=999617" title="Snake venom">
<text>Snake venom is a highly toxic saliva containing zootoxins that facilitates in the immobilization and digestion of prey. This also provides defense against threats. Snake venom is usually injected by unique fangs during a bite, though some species are also able to spit venom.

The venom glands that secrete zootoxins are a modification of the parotid salivary glands found in other vertebrates and are usually located on each side of the head, below and behind the eye, and enclosed in a muscular sheath. The venom is stored in large glands called alveoli before being conveyed by a duct to the base of channeled or tubular fangs through which it is ejected.

Venom contains more than 20 different compounds, which are mostly proteins and polypeptides. The complex mixture of proteins, enzymes, and various other substances has toxic and lethal properties. Venom serves to immobilize prey. Enzymes in venom play an important role in the digestion of prey, and various other substances are responsible for important but non-lethal biological effects. Some of the proteins in snake venom have very specific effects on various biological functions, including blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and transmission of nerve or muscle impulses. These venoms have been studied and developed for use as pharmacological or diagnostic tools, and even drugs.

== Chemistry ==
Proteins constitute 90-95% of venom&#x27;s dry weight and are responsible for almost all of its biological effects. The hundreds, even thousands, of proteins found in venom include toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms, including digestive hydrolases, L-amino-acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey&#x27;s cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate the absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (&quot;Dendroaspis&quot;), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.

Snake toxins vary greatly in their functions. The two broad classes of toxins found in snake venoms are neurotoxins (mostly found in elapids) and hemotoxins (mostly found in viperids). However, exceptions occur – the venom of the black-necked spitting cobra (&quot;Naja nigricollis&quot;), an elapid, consists mainly of cytotoxins, while that of the Mojave rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus scutulatus&quot;), a viperid, is primarily neurotoxic. Both elapids and viperids may carry numerous other types of toxins.

== Toxins ==
===Neurotoxins===
The beginning of a new neural impulse goes as follows:

# An exchange of ions (charged atoms) across the nerve cell membrane sends a depolarizing current towards the end of the nerve cell (cell terminus).
# When the depolarizing current arrives at the nerve cell terminus, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which is held in vesicles, is released into the space between the two nerves (synapse). It moves across the synapse to the postsynaptic receptors.
# ACh binds to the receptors and transfers the signal to the target cell, and after a short time, it&#x27;s destroyed by acetylcholinesterase.

====Fasciculins====
:These toxins attack cholinergic neurons (those that use ACh as a transmitter) by destroying acetylcholinesterase (AChE). ACh, therefore, cannot be broken down and stays in the receptor. This causes tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), which can lead to death. The toxins have been called fasciculins since after injection into mice, they cause severe, generalized and long-lasting (5-7 h) fasciculations (rapid muscle contractions).
:Snake example: found mostly in the venom of mambas (&quot;Dendroaspis&quot; spp.) and some rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus&quot; spp.)
====Dendrotoxins====
:Dendrotoxins inhibit neurotransmissions by blocking the exchange of positive and negative ions across the neuronal membrane lead to no nerve impulse, thereby paralyzing the nerves.
:Snake example: mambas
====α-neurotoxins====
:Alpha-neurotoxins are a large group; over 100 postsynaptic neurotoxins having been identified and sequenced. α-neurotoxins attack the Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of cholinergic neurons. They mimic the shape of the acetylcholine molecule, and so fit into the receptors, where they block the ACh flow, leading to a feeling of numbness and paralysis.
:Snake examples: king cobra (&quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot;) (known as hannahtoxin containing α-neurotoxins), sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) (known as erabutoxin), many-banded krait (&quot;Bungarus multicinctu&quot;s) (known as α-bungarotoxin), and cobras (&quot;Naja&quot; spp.) (known as cobratoxin)

=== Cytotoxins ===

====Phospholipases====
:Phospholipase is an enzyme that transforms the phospholipid molecule into a lysophospholipid (soap) → the new molecule attracts and binds fat and ruptures cell membranes. Phospholipase A2 is one specific type of phospholipases found in snake venom.
:Snake example: Okinawan habu (&quot;Trimeresurus flavoviridis&quot;)
====Cardiotoxins / Cytotoxins====
:Cardiotoxins are components that are specifically toxic to the heart. They bind to particular sites on the surface of muscle cells and cause depolarisation → the toxin prevents muscle contraction. These toxins may cause the heart to beat irregularly or stop beating, causing death. An example is the three-fingered cardiotoxin III from Chinese cobra, an example of the short three-fingered family ().
: Snake example: mambas, and some &quot;Naja&quot; species
====Hemotoxins====
:Hemotoxins cause hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes), or induce blood coagulation (clotting, e.g. mucrocetin). A common family of hemotoxins includes snake venom metalloproteinases such as mucrolysin.
:Snake examples: most vipers and many cobra species: The tropical rattlesnake &quot;Crotalus durissus&quot; produces convulxin, a coagulant.

===Myotoxins===

Myotoxins are small, basic peptides found in rattlesnake and lizard (e.g. Mexican beaded lizard) venoms. This involves a non-enzymatic mechanism that leads to severe skeletal muscle necrosis. These peptides act very quickly, causing instantaneous paralysis to prevent prey from escaping and eventually death due to diaphragmatic paralysis.

The first myotoxin to be identified and isolated was crotamine, discovered in the 1950s by Brazilian scientist José Moura Gonçalves from the venom of tropical South American rattlesnake &quot;Crotalus durissus terrificus&quot;. Its biological actions, molecular structure and gene responsible for its synthesis were all elucidated in the last two decades.

==Determining venom toxicity (LD50)==

Snake venom toxicity is assessed by a toxicological test called the median lethal dose, lethal dose 50% (abbreviated as LD50), which determines the concentration of a toxin required to kill half the members of a tested population. The potency of wild snake venom varies considerably because of assorted influences such as biophysical environment, physiological status, ecological variables, genetic variation (either adaptive or incidental), and other molecular and ecological evolutionary factors. This is true even for members of one species. Such variation is smaller in captive populations in laboratory settings, though it cannot be eliminated. However, studies to determine snake venom potency must be designed to minimize variability.

Several techniques have been designed to this end. One approach is to use 0.1% bovine serum albumin (also known as &quot;fraction V&quot; in Cohn process) as a diluent in determining LD50 values. It results in more accurate and consistent LD50 determinations than using 0.1% saline as a diluent. For example, fraction V produces about 95% purified albumin (dried crude venom). Saline as a diluent consistently produces widely varying LD50 results for nearly all venomous snakes. It produces unpredictable variation in precipitate purity (35-60%). Fraction V is structurally stable because it has seventeen disulfide bonds; it&#x27;s unique in that it has the highest solubility and lowest isoelectric point of major plasma proteins. This makes it the final fraction to be precipitated from its solution. Bovine serum albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, near the pH of the proteins, and maintaining the ethanol concentration at 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction.

When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for injection or transfusion, the plasma component must be highly pure. The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. it&#x27;s known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation, as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5 °C and 3 °C. The Cohn Process exploits differences in plasma proteins properties, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0 to 40%, the pH declines from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. At each stage, proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses fewer steps, and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration. Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn process and its variations. Chromatographic albumin processing emerged in the 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the scarity of large-scale chromatography equipment. Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryo-depleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following ion exchange chromatography steps. After ion exchange, generally purification steps and buffer exchange occur.

However, chromatographic methods began to be adopted in the 1980s. Developments were ongoing between when Cohn fractionation started emerge in 1946, and when chromatography emerged, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler and Nistchmann process was created as a spin-off of the Cohn process. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created, which incorporated chromatography with variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurization at 60 °C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process because:

* smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed,
* easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment
* chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein
* a more successful albumin result can be achieved.

Compared with the Cohn process, albumin purity increased from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements such as purity. The big drawback has to do with the economics. Although the method offered efficient, acquiring the necessary equipment was difficult. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time, the lack of equipment availability limited its widespread use.

== Evolution ==

Venom evolved just once among all Toxicofera about 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the huge venom diversity seen today. The original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins evolved independently in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages have since lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet or a change in predatory tactics. In addition to this, venom strength and composition has changed due to changes in the prey of certain snake species. For example, the venom of the marbled sea snake (&quot;Aipysurus eydouxii&quot;) became significantly less toxic after the diet of this species changed from fish to strictly fish eggs. The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.

The mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication in tissues unrelated to the venom. Pre-existing salivary proteins are the likely ancestors of most venom toxin genes. Expression of the new protein in the venom gland followed duplication. Then proceeded natural selection for adaptive traits following the birth-and-death model, where duplication is followed by functional diversification, resulting in the creation of structurally related proteins that have slightly different functions. The study of venom evolution has been a high priority for scientists in terms of scientific research, due to the medical relevance of snake venom, in terms of making antivenom and cancer research. Knowing more about the composition of venom and the ways it can potentially evolve is very beneficial. Three main factors that affect venom evolution have been closely studied: predators of the snake that are resistant to snake venom, prey that are in an evolutionary arms race with snakes, and the specific diets that affect the intraspecific evolution of venom. Venoms continue to evolve as specific toxins and are modified to target a specific prey, and toxins are found to vary according to diet in some species.

Rapid venom evolution can also be explained by the arms race between venom-targeted molecules in resistant predators, such as the opossum, and the snake venom that targets the molecules. Scientists performed experiments on the opossums and found that multiple trials showed replacement to silent substitutions in the von Willebrand factor (&quot;vWf&quot;) gene that encodes for a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein. These substitutions are thought to weaken the connection between vWf and a toxic snake venom ligand (botrocetin), which changes the net charge and hydrophobicity. These results are significant to the venom evolution because it&#x27;s the first citation of rapid evolution in a venom-targeted molecule. This shows that an evolutionary arms race may be occurring in terms of defensive purposes. Alternative hypotheses suggest that venom evolution is due to trophic adaption, whereas these scientists believe, in this case, that selection would occur on traits that help with prey survival in terms of venom evolution instead of predation success. Several other predators of the pit viper (mongooses and hedgehogs) show the same type of relationship between snakes, which helps to support the hypothesis that venom has a very strong defensive role along with a trophic role. Which in turn supports the idea that predation on the snakes can be the arms race that produces snake venom evolution.

Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, as well as a method to track down prey after a bite. Though venom function has evolved to be specific to prey class (e.g. particular coagulatory effects), the evolution of broad toxicological effects (e.g. neurotoxicity or coagulotoxicity) does not appear to be broadly affected by prey type. The presence of digestive enzymes in snake venom was once believed to be an adaptation to assist digestion. However, studies of the western diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot;), a snake with highly proteolytic venom, show that venom has no impact on the time required for food to pass through the gut. These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.

==Injection==

===Vipers===
In vipers, which have the most highly developed venom-delivery apparatus, the venom gland is very large and is surrounded by the masseter or temporal muscle, which consists of two bands, the superior arising from behind the eye, the inferior extending from the gland to the mandible. A duct carries venom from the gland to the fang. In vipers and elapids, this groove is completely closed, forming a hypodermic needle-like tube. In other species, the grooves are not covered, or only partially covered. From the anterior extremity of the gland, the duct passes below the eye and above the maxillary bone, to the basal orifice of the venom fang, which is ensheathed in a thick fold of mucous membrane. By means of the movable maxillary bone hinged to the prefrontal bone and connected with the transverse bone, which is pushed forward by muscles set in action by the opening of the mouth, the fang is erected and the venom discharged through the distal orifice. When the snake bites, the jaws close and the muscles surrounding the gland contract, causing venom to be ejected via the fangs.

===Elapids===
In the proteroglyphous elapids, the fangs are tubular, but are short and do not possess the mobility seen in vipers.

===Colubrids===
Opisthoglyphous colubrids have enlarged, grooved teeth situated at the posterior extremity of the maxilla, where a small posterior portion of the upper labial or salivary gland produces venom.

===Mechanics of biting===
Several genera, including Asian coral snakes (&quot;Calliophis&quot;), burrowing asps (&quot;Atractaspis&quot;), and night adders (&quot;Causus&quot;), are remarkable for having exceptionally long venom glands, extending along each side of the body, in some cases extending posterially as far as the heart. Instead of the muscles of the temporal region serving to press out the venom into the duct, this action is performed by those of the side of the body.

Considerable variability in biting behavior is seen among snakes. When biting, viperid snakes often strike quickly, discharging venom as the fangs penetrate the skin, and then immediately release. Alternatively, as in the case of a feeding response, some viperids (e.g. &quot;Lachesis&quot;) bite and hold. A proteroglyph or opisthoglyph may close its jaws and bite or chew firmly for a considerable time.

Differences in fang length between the various venomous snakes are likely due to the evolution of different striking strategies. Additionally, it has been shown that the fangs of different species of venomous snakes have different sizes and shapes depending on the biomechanical properties of the snake&#x27;s prey.

===Mechanics of spitting===
Spitting cobras of the genera &quot;Naja&quot; and &quot;Hemachatus&quot;, when irritated or threatened, may eject streams or a spray of venom a distance of to . These snakes&#x27; fangs have been modified for the purposes of spitting; inside the fangs, the channel makes a 90° bend to the lower front of the fang. Spitters may spit repeatedly and still be able to deliver a fatal bite.

Spitting is a defensive reaction only. The snakes tend to aim for the eyes of a perceived threat. A direct hit can cause temporary shock and blindness through severe inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva. Although usually no serious symptoms result if the venom is washed away immediately with plenty of water, blindness can become permanent if left untreated. Brief contact with the skin is not immediately dangerous, but open wounds may be vectors for envenomation.

==Physiological effects==

The four distinct types of venom act on the body differently:
* Proteolytic venom dismantles the molecular surroundings, including at the site of the bite.
* Hemotoxic venom acts on the cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood.
* Neurotoxic venom acts on the nervous system, including the brain.
* Cytotoxic venom has a localized action at the site of the bite.

===Proteroglyphous snakes===
The effect of the venom of proteroglyphous snakes (sea snakes, kraits, mambas, black snakes, tiger snakes, and death adders) is mainly on the nervous system, respiratory paralysis being quickly produced by bringing the venom into contact with the central nervous mechanism that controls respiration; the pain and local swelling that follow a bite are not usually severe. The bite of all the proteroglyphous elapids, even of the smallest and gentlest, such as the coral snakes, is, so far as known, deadly to humans. However, some mildly venomous elapids remain, such as the hooded snakes (&quot;Parasuta&quot;), bandy-bandies (&quot;Vermicella&quot;), etc.

===Vipers===
Viper venom (Russell&#x27;s viper, saw-scaled vipers, bushmasters, and rattlesnakes) acts more on the vascular system, bringing about coagulation of the blood and clotting of the pulmonary arteries; its action on the nervous system is not great, no individual group of nerve-cells appears to be picked out, and the effect upon respiration is not so direct; the influence upon the circulation explains the great depression, which is a symptom of viperine envenomation. The pain of the wound is severe and is rapidly followed by swelling and discoloration. The symptoms produced by the bite of the European vipers are thus described by Martin and Lamb:

The Viperidae differ much among themselves in the toxicity of their venoms. Some, such as the Indian Russell&#x27;s viper (&quot;Daboia russelli&quot;) and saw-scaled viper (&quot;E. carinatus&quot;); the American rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus&quot; spp.), bushmasters (&quot;Lachesis&quot; spp.), and lanceheads (&quot;Bothrops&quot; spp.); and the African adders (&quot;Bitis&quot; spp.), night adders (&quot;Causus&quot; spp.), and horned vipers (&quot;Cerastes&quot; spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, at least in the hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small meadow viper (&quot;Vipera ursinii&quot;), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, does not seem to be possessed of a very virulent venom, and although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.

===Opisthoglyphous colubrids===
Biologists had long known that some snakes had rear fangs, &#x27;inferior&#x27; venom injection mechanisms that might immobilize prey; although a few fatalities were on record, until 1957, the possibility that such snakes were deadly to humans seemed at most remote. The deaths of two prominent herpetologists, Robert Mertens and Karl Schmidt, from African colubrid bites, changed that assessment, and recent events reveal that several other species of rear-fanged snakes have venoms that are potentially lethal to large vertebrates.

Boomslang (&quot;Dispholidus typus&quot;) and twig snake (&quot;Thelotornis&quot; spp.) venoms are toxic to blood cells and thin the blood (hemotoxic, hemorrhagic). Early symptoms include headaches, nausea, diarrhea, lethargy, mental disorientation, bruising, and bleeding at the site and all body openings. Exsanguination is the main cause of death from such a bite.

The boomslang&#x27;s venom is the most potent of all rear-fanged snakes in the world based on LD50. Although its venom may be more potent than some vipers and elapids, it causes fewer fatalities owing to various factors (for example, the fangs&#x27; effectiveness is not high compared with many other snakes, the venom dose delivered is low, and boomslangs are generally less aggressive in comparison to other venomous snakes such as cobras and mambas). Symptoms of a bite from these snakes include nausea and internal bleeding, and one could die from a brain hemorrhage and respiratory collapse.

===Aglyphous snakes===
Experiments made with the secretion of the parotid gland of &quot;Rhabdophis&quot; and &quot;Zamenis&quot; have shown that even aglyphous snakes are not entirely devoid of venom, and point to the conclusion that the physiological difference between so-called harmless and venomous snakes is only one of degree, just as various steps exist in the transformation of an ordinary parotid gland into a venom gland or of a solid tooth into a tubular or grooved fang.

== Use of snake venoms to treat disease ==
Given that snake venom contains many biologically active ingredients, some may be useful to treat disease.

For instance, phospholipases type A2 (PLA2s) from the Tunisian vipers &quot;Cerastes cerastes&quot; and &quot;Macrovipera lebetina&quot; have been found to have antitumor activity. Anticancer activity has been also reported for other compounds in snake venom. PLA2s hydrolyze phospholipids, thus could act on bacterial cell surfaces, providing novel antimicrobial (antibiotic) activities.

The analgesic (pain-killing) activity of many snake venom proteins has been long known. The main challenge, however, is how to deliver protein to the nerve cells: proteins usually are not applicable as pills.

== Immunity ==

===Among snakes===
The question whether individual snakes are immune to their own venom has not yet been definitively settled, though an example is known of a cobra that self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention, but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans. Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula&quot;) and the Central and South American mussurana (&quot;Clelia&quot; spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines, which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (&quot;Spilotes pullatus&quot;) is the enemy of the fer-de-lance (&quot;Bothrops caribbaeus&quot;) in St. Lucia, and in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;) not to be affected by the bite of the European adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;) and the European asp (&quot;Vipera aspis&quot;), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes, as well as king snakes, have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species. The king cobra, which does prey on cobras, is said to be immune to their venom.

===Among other animals===
The hedgehog (Erinaceidae), the mongoose (Herpestidae), the honey badger (&quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;) and the opossum are known to be immune to a dose of snake venom. Recently, the honey badger and domestic pig were found to have convergently evolved amino-acid replacements in their nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which are known to confer resistance to alpha-neurotoxins in hedgehogs. Whether the pig may be considered immune is still uncertain, though early studies show endogenous resistance in pigs tested against neurotoxins. Though the pig&#x27;s subcutaneous layer of fat may protect it against snake venom, most venoms pass easily through vascular fat layers, making this unlikely to contribute to its ability to resist venoms. The garden dormouse (&quot;Eliomys quercinus&quot;) has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom. Some populations of California ground squirrel (&quot;Otospermophilus beecheyi&quot;) are at least partially immune to rattlesnake venom as adults.

===Among humans===
The acquisition of human immunity against snake venom is ancient (from around 60 CE, Psylli tribe). Research into development of vaccines that will lead to immunity is ongoing. Bill Haast, owner and director of the Miami Serpentarium, injected himself with snake venom during most of his adult life, in an effort to build up an immunity to a broad array of venomous snakes, in a practice known as mithridatism. Haast lived to age 100, and survived a reported 172 snake bites. He donated his blood to be used in treating snake-bite patients when a suitable antivenom was not available. More than 20 so-treated individuals recovered. Amateur researcher Tim Friede also lets venomous snakes bite him in the hopes of a vaccine against snake venom being developed, and has survived over 160 bites from different species as of January 2016.

==Traditional treatments==

The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the world&#x27;s population depends on traditional medicine for their primary health-care needs. Methods of traditional treatments of snakebites, although of questionable efficacy and perhaps even harmful, are nonetheless relevant.

Plants used to treat snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called snake bottles, which contain several different plants and/or insects. The plants used include the vine called monkey ladder (&quot;Bauhinia cumanensis&quot; or &quot;Bauhinia excisa&quot;, Fabaceae), which is pounded and put on the bite. Alternatively, a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle. Other plants used include mat root (&quot;Aristolochia rugosa&quot;), cat&#x27;s claw (&quot;Pithecellobim unguis-cati&quot;), tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;), snake bush (&quot;Barleria lupulina&quot;), obie seed (&quot;Cola nitida&quot;), and wild gri gri root (&quot;Acrocomia aculeata&quot;). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (&quot;Battus polydamas&quot;, Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (&quot;Aristolochia trilobata&quot;). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (&quot;Cecropia peltata&quot;) and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean, which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (&quot;Renealmia alpinia&quot;) (berries), which are crushed together with the juice of wild cane (&quot;Costus scaber&quot;) and given to the bitten. Quick fixes have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged, due to the risk of self-envenomation through knife cuts or cuts in the mouth (suction cups from snake bite kits can be used, but suctioning seldom provides any measurable benefit).

=== Serotherapy ===
Serotherapy using antivenom is a common current treatment and has been described back in 1913. Both adaptive immunity and serotherapy are specific to the type of snake; venom with identical physiological action do not cross-neutralize. Boulenger 1913 describes the following cases:

A European in Australia who had become immune to the venom of the deadly Australian tiger snake (&quot;Notechis scutatus&quot;), manipulating these snakes with impunity, and was under the impression that his immunity extended also to other species, when bitten by a lowland copperhead (&quot;Austrelaps superbus&quot;), an allied elapine, died the following day.

In India, the serum prepared with the venom of monocled cobra &quot;Naja kaouthia&quot; has been found to be without effect on the venom of two species of kraits (&quot;Bungarus&quot;), Russell&#x27;s viper (&quot;Daboia russelli&quot;), saw-scaled viper (&quot;Echis carinatus&quot;), and Pope&#x27;s pit viper (&quot;Trimeresurus popeiorum&quot;). Russell&#x27;s viper serum is without effect on colubrine venoms, or those of &quot;Echis&quot; and &quot;Trimeresurus&quot;.

In Brazil, serum prepared with the venom of lanceheads (&quot;Bothrops&quot; spp.) is without action on rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus&quot; spp.) venom.

Antivenom snakebite treatment must be matched as the type of envenomation that has occurred. In the Americas, polyvalent antivenoms are available that are effective against the bites of most pit vipers. Crofab is the antivenom developed to treat the bite of North American pit vipers. These are not effective against coral snake envenomation, which requires a specific antivenom to their neurotoxic venom. The situation is even more complex in countries such as India, with its rich mix of vipers (Viperidae) and highly neurotoxic cobras and kraits of the Elapidae.

<text>CFXJ-FM (93.5 FM, &quot;New Country 93.5&quot;) is a radio station in Toronto, Ontario. Owned by Stingray Radio, it broadcasts a country music format. Its studios are located on Yonge Street at St. Clair Avenue in Toronto&#x27;s Deer Park neighbourhood.

CFXJ was Canada&#x27;s first Black-owned radio station, and was launched on February 9, 2001 under the on-air brand of &quot;Flow 93.5&quot;. From its launch through 2022, the station gravitated between various urban contemporary and rhythmic contemporary formats, maintaining the &quot;Flow&quot; branding for all but a three-year period from 2016 to 2019 where it branded as &quot;The Move&quot; instead.

The station went through several ownership changes, with CTVglobemedia buying the station in 2010, followed by Newcap Broadcasting in 2013 (as a condition of Bell Media&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media). Newcap was acquired by Stingray Group in 2018. In 2022, the station dropped the &quot;Flow&quot; format and flipped to adult hits as &quot;Today Radio&quot;, with Stingray reaching an agreement with the new owner of fellow urban station CKFG-FM to move the &quot;Flow&quot; branding there. In August 2024, the format was dropped, and the station began to soft launch a new country music format—which formally launched on September 3, 2024 as &quot;New Country 93.5&quot;.

CFXJ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 1,058 watts (3,706 watts peak). The main transmitter is located atop First Canadian Place in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District.

==History==
===Launch===
Milestone Radio, a company incorporated by Denham Jolly, first applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for an urban contemporary music station in 1989. Milestone was passed over in favour of a country music station, CISS. Jolly applied again in 1997, and was passed over in favour of CBLA, the Radio One station, which the CBC wanted to move to FM as it was leaving its longtime Toronto AM outlet, CBL.

Both decisions sparked controversy in Toronto, a city with Canada&#x27;s largest minority population but with no urban contemporary outlet. Some accused the CRTC of passing over an urban station in favour of existing radio services as an example of racism. The lack of an urban station also created difficulties for Canadian hip-hop, reggae and R&amp;B musicians, who had no radio outlets in Canada to play and promote their music.

As well, the 99.1 signal which was awarded to the CBC was believed to be the last available FM frequency in the city. However, in 1998, the CBC found that it was able to surrender two of the CBC&#x27;s repeater transmitters outside of Toronto due to CBLA&#x27;s superior coverage of the region. In 2000, the CRTC opened applications for new services on these two frequencies. With Milestone&#x27;s third application, the CRTC awarded the 93.5 frequency to the company on June 16 of that year.

CFXJ signed on the air at 9:35 p.m. on February 9, 2001, under the name &quot;Flow 93.5&quot;. &quot;Roots, Rock, Reggae&quot; by Bob Marley and the Wailers was the first song played. For several weeks, the station was automated. Live programming launched on March 1. Before the station became prominent in the Greater Toronto Area, many listeners would try to tune in to Buffalo, New York&#x27;s WBLK, which has aired an urban contemporary format since the 1960s. Since CFXJ&#x27;s debut, many Canadian hip hop and R&amp;B musicians, including Jully Black, k-os, Kardinal Offishall and Jarvis Church have made the types of significant career breakthroughs that often eluded Canadian urban musicians in the 1990s.

===Rhythmic top 40 era (2007–2014)===
In 2005, the station began to shift towards a more rhythmic direction. In 2007, the station re-branded as &quot;The New Flow 93.5&quot;, completing its shift to a rhythmic contemporary format. By 2009, with Rogers&#x27; relaunch of the &quot;Kiss&quot; Top 40 (CHR) format on CKIS, CFXJ shifted back towards an urban direction. However, this proved unsuccessful, and many of the adult urban tracks were dropped by March 2010.

On June 23, 2010, it was announced that CTVglobemedia&#x27;s CHUM Radio would acquire the station, subject to CRTC approval. The transaction was approved on December 23. CHUM previously had a joint venture with Milestone with CHBN-FM in Edmonton, which was later sold to Rogers Radio along with CHST-FM in London. The station&#x27;s headquarters were relocated from their longtime home at 211 Yonge Street to CTV&#x27;s 250 Richmond Street West (near 299 Queen Street West, where MuchMusic and other CTV specialty television stations were based). In February 2011, the sale to CTVglobemedia (which was acquired by shareholder Bell Canada and renamed Bell Media several months later) was completed. Upon the closure of the sale, many on the staff were laid off, all specialty programming was cancelled, and the station shifted back to a rhythmic contemporary format.

CHUM&#x27;s vice president of programming, David Corey, replaced Wayne Williams as PD and reshuffled the lineup. He brought in fellow ex-WJMN Boston imaging director Scott Morello as APD, and re-teamed morning host Melanie Martin with her fellow CKIS alumnus J.J. King. Midday personality Miss Ange, afternoon drive time personality Jeni, swing personality Peter Kash, MD Justin Dumont, promotions coordinator Angelique Knights, morning show producer Johnny Michaels, creative writer John Shannon, and producer Korey Bray, along with former sales manager Byron Garby and some other account representatives, were all retained. With the launch of urban AC competitor CKFG-FM, the station moved back to an urban direction once more. However, by December 2012, the station had moved back to a rhythmic CHR format.

In March 2013, the Competition Bureau approved a proposal by Bell Media to acquire Astral Media, under the condition that it divest itself of several television services and radio stations. Following the closure of the merger in July 2013, CFXJ was placed in a blind trust pending its eventual sale. CFXJ and four other Astral Media radio stations were sold to Newcap Radio for $112 million. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 19, 2014, and the sale closed on March 31, 2014. With the sale, CFXJ moved its studios to the former CFRB and CKFM studios at 2 St. Clair West (at Yonge and St. Clair).

===Classic hip hop era (2014–2016)===
In late 2014, influenced by the popularity of &quot;The Back in the Day Buffet&quot; noon-hour mix-show, as well as the growing popularity of the classic hip-hop format in the United States, the station revamped its playlist to include hip-hop hits, R&amp;B and reggae tracks from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, while still playing some currents. In addition, CFXJ added a secondary slogan: &quot;The Best Throwbacks and Hottest Hits&quot;.

By March 2015, the station&#x27;s primary slogan was altered to &quot;All The Best Throwbacks&quot;.

=== The Move, return to Flow (2016–2022)===
On February 25, 2016, CFXJ went jockless and began promoting a &quot;big move&quot; to take place at 8 a.m. the following Monday (February 29). At that time, after playing &quot;Over&quot; by Toronto native Drake, the station flipped to rhythmic adult contemporary as &quot;93.5 The Move&quot;, with a focus on rhythmic and hip-hop hits from the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The first song on &quot;The Move&quot; was &quot;The Way You Move&quot; by OutKast. CFXJ joined CKBE Montreal as the only English-language rhythmic AC outlets in Canada.

As part of the rebrand, the station also axed numerous on air hosts, including Melanie Martin of the &quot;JJ &amp; Melanie&quot; morning show, midday host Miss Ange, and evening host Megan Coady. Weekend host J&#x27;ness moved to sister station CIHT-FM in Ottawa prior to the rebrand. On November 6, 2017, CFXJ switched back to a rhythmic contemporary format once again, while maintaining the &quot;Move&quot; branding and a small amount of rhythmic recurrents. CFXJ also changed slogans to &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Hits. Toronto&#x27;s Throwbacks.&quot; before changing to &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Hip Hop&quot;.

Newcap Radio was acquired by Stingray Group in October 2018. On February 11, 2019, CFXJ reverted to the &quot;Flow 93.5&quot; branding and returned to an urban contemporary format.

===&quot;Flow&quot; moves to 98.7; &quot;Today Radio&quot; (2022–2024)===

On February 9, 2022, Stingray announced that it had reached an agreement with CKFG-FM and its new owner, Neeti P. Ray&#x27;s CINA Media Group, to move the &quot;Flow&quot; branding to that station beginning February 14, and that 93.5 would launch a new format the same day. CFXJ subsequently went jockless, and much of its on-air staff was let go.

A Stingray executive stated that the company had originally wanted to &quot;[bring] &quot;Flow&quot; back to its roots as a community-driven station&quot;. However, after realizing that this would have competed directly with CKFG, Stingray instead reached an agreement to transfer the &quot;Flow&quot; brand to that station. CINA plans to position the station as serving the entirety of Toronto&#x27;s Black Canadian community by essentially merging the two formats into one station, adding the hip-hop already heard on &quot;Flow&quot; to its existing format of R&amp;B and Afro-Caribbean music.

On February 13, CFXJ began stunting with a self-described &quot;random selection&quot; of pop songs, interspersed with promos redirecting &quot;Flow&quot; listeners to CKFG, and sweepers stating that &quot;Today&quot; was &quot;arriving tomorrow&quot;. The following day at midnight, CFXJ relaunched as &quot;93.5 Today Radio&quot;, an adult hits format with a focus on topical discussions and interactions with listeners. The brand and format were licensed from a Vancouver-based marketing company. The format is also aired on Pattison Media&#x27;s CKCE-FM in Calgary, with similarities to the &quot;Now!&quot; hot adult contemporary format used by its sister stations CKNO-FM Edmonton and CHNW-FM Winnipeg.

On September 20, 2022, the CRTC published applications by Stingray to add boosters for CFXJ on the 93.5 frequency in Mississauga and in the North York district of Toronto, which Stingray said would be the first single-frequency network implementation of its kind in Canada. The applications, which were opposed by a subsidiary of Evanov Communications, were denied in September 2023, on the grounds that they would have constituted a &quot;service expansion&quot; beyond the station&#x27;s current licensed area.
===&quot;New Country 93.5&quot; (2024-present)===
On August 29, 2024, at 10a.m., CFXJ dropped the &quot;Today Radio&quot; format, with Stingray citing an inability to grow its audience. The station then began stunting with a playlist of country music hits, interspersed with sweepers teasing an official launch of a country format at 6 a.m. on September 3; at that time, the station officially relaunched as &quot;New Country 93.5&quot;. Its branding is shared with other Stingray-owned country stations. Some of the airstaff from the &quot;Today Radio&quot; format was maintained, particularly afternoon host Vanessa Newman, and former CMT personality Paul McGuire (who moved to mornings; McGuire hosts a networked show for the other &quot;New Country&quot; stations).&quot;&quot; Evenings feature &quot;The Casey Clarke Show&quot; from Penticton sister station CIGV-FM, hosted by the former CMT personality.

The flip gave Toronto its first in-market country music station since 1999, when CISS flipped to CHR. Its main competition are rimshot stations out of Ajax (CJKX-FM), Hamilton (CHKX-FM), and Newmarket (CKDX-FM).&quot;&quot;

<text>Stuart Christie (10 July 1946 – 15 August 2020) was a Scottish anarchist writer and publisher. When aged 18, Christie was arrested while carrying explosives to assassinate the Spanish caudillo, General Francisco Franco. He was later alleged to be a member of the Angry Brigade, but was acquitted of related charges. He went on to found Cienfuegos Press, an anarchist publishing house, as well as radical publications &quot;The Free-Winged Eagle&quot; and &quot;The Hastings Trawler&quot;, and in 2006 the online Anarchist Film Channel, which hosts films and documentaries with anarchist and libertarian socialist themes. His memoir &quot;Granny Made Me an Anarchist&quot; was published in 2004.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christie was born in the Partick area of Glasgow, Scotland, and was raised in Blantyre by his mother and grandparents, becoming an anarchist at a young age. He ascribed this to his grandmother&#x27;s influence: &quot;Basically, what she did was provide a moral barometer which married almost exactly with that of libertarian socialism and anarchism, and she provided the star which I followed.&quot; He joined the Anarchist Federation in Glasgow in 1962, at the age of 16. He became active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), attracted to the more militant approach of the Direct Action Committee and Committee of 100, and took part in the confrontational Faslane Naval Base CND demonstration on 14 February 1963, among others.

===Attempt to assassinate Franco===
On the last day of July 1964, an 18-year-old Christie departed London for Paris, where he picked up plastic explosives from the anarchist organisation Defensa Interior.

Before he left England, he was interviewed for a television programme with Malcolm Muggeridge, a known MI6 contact, and asked whether he felt the assassination of Franco would be right. He answered that it would; when the programme was broadcast after his arrest in Spain, these comments were edited out.

Christie hitchhiked into Spain and was arrested in Madrid on 11 August 1964 in possession of explosives. He faced a military trial and a possible execution sentence by garrote, but was instead sentenced to twenty years in prison. An accomplice, Fernando Carballo Blanco, was sentenced to thirty years&#x27; imprisonment. He served three years in Carabanchel Prison, where he studied for A-Levels and was brought into contact with anarchist prisoners, including Miguel García García, Luis Andres Edo and Juan Busquets. Christie was later freed. The official reason given by Francoist Spain was that it was due to a plea from Christie&#x27;s mother.

===Back in Britain===

After his release he continued his activism in the British anarchist movement, re-formed the Anarchist Black Cross and &quot;Black Flag&quot; with Albert Meltzer, was acquitted of involvement with the Angry Brigade, and started the publishing house Cienfuegos Press, which for a number of years he operated from Sanday, Orkney, where he also edited and published a local Orcadian newspaper, &quot;The Free-Winged Eagle&quot;.

Christie had various writing and journalistic jobs including as editor of an unauthorised British edition of &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Argumenty i Fakty&quot; (&quot;Arguments and Facts International&quot;) in the late years of the Soviet Union and the early years of the Russian Federation.

=== Later Life ===
Christie attracted criticism from some fellow anarchists for making a gestural protest vote against Labour and its war in Iraq by voting for George Galloway&#x27;s Respect - The Unity Coalition in the European Parliament elections that year, because of the general anarchist stance against participating in capitalist democracy.

Christie&#x27;s wife of more than 50 years, Brenda Christie, herself a committed anti-fascist anarchist and militant who co-founded Cienfuegos Press alongside her husband, died of cancer at the age of 70 in June 2019. Stuart Christie himself died aged 74, also from cancer, on 15 August 2020.

==Published work==
An updated and single-volume version of his autobiography &quot;Granny Made Me an Anarchist&quot; was published in 2004 by Scribner. It had previously been published in three parts, the other titles being &quot;General Franco Made Me a Terrorist&quot;, and &quot;Edward Heath Made Me Angry&quot;. Christie also wrote articles attacking freemasonry.

He also wrote, with Albert Meltzer, &quot;The Floodgates of Anarchy&quot;. Christie&#x27;s other books include &quot;Stefano Delle Chiaie: Portrait of a Black Terrorist&quot;, (on Italian neo-fascist terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie, founder of &quot;Avanguardia Nazionale&quot; and member of P2 masonic lodge) and &quot;We, the Anarchists!: A Study of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), 1927–1937&quot; (2000).

As a publisher Christie founded Cienfuegos Press in 1972 and edited the &quot;Cienfuegos Anarchist Review&quot; (c. 1977–1982), Refract Publications (1982), The Meltzer Press (1996) and Christiebooks/Christiebooks.com/Read &#x27;N&#x27; Noir. His &quot;The Christie File&quot; was published by the Cienfuegos Press in 1980. He also edited &quot;The Hastings Trawler&quot;, a monthly magazine that ran from 2005 to 2006.

Christie also translated into English the biography of Francisco Sabate Llopart, &quot;Sabate: An Extraordinary Guerrilla&quot;, by Antonio Téllez Solá.

<text>A [[snake]] [[skeleton]] consists primarily of the skull, vertebrae, and ribs, with only vestigial remnants of the limbs.

==Skull==

The skull of a snake is a very complex structure, with numerous joints to allow the snake to swallow prey far larger than its head.

The typical snake skull has a solidly ossified braincase, with the separate frontal bones and the united parietal bones extending downward to the basisphenoid, which is large and extends forward into a rostrum extending to the ethmoidal region. The nose is less ossified, and the paired nasal bones are often attached only at their base. The occipital condyle is either trilobate and formed by the basioccipital and the exoccipitals, or a simple knob formed by the basioccipital; the supraoccipital is excluded from the foramen magnum. The basioccipital may bear a 
curved ventral process or hypapophysis in the vipers.

The prefrontal bone is situated, on each side, between the frontal bone and the maxilla, and may or may not be in contact with the nasal bone.

The postfrontal bone, usually present, borders the orbit behind, rarely also above, and in the pythons a supraorbital bone is between it and the prefrontal bone.

The premaxillary bone is single and small and as a rule, connected with the maxillary only by ligament.

The paired vomer is narrow.

The palatine bone and pterygoid are long and parallel to the axis of the skull, the latter diverging behind and extending to the quadrate or to the articular extremity of the mandible; the pterygoid is connected with the maxillary by the ectopterygoid or transverse bone, which may be very long, and the maxillary often emits a process towards the palatine, the latter bone being usually produced inwards and upwards towards the anterior extremity of the basisphenoid.

The quadrate is usually large and elongate, and attached to the cranium through the supratemporal (often regarded as the squamosal).

In rare cases, (&quot;Polemon&quot;) the transverse bone is forked and articulates with the two branches of the maxilla.

The quadrate and maxillary and palatopterygoid arches are more or less movable to allow for the required by the passage of prey, often much exceeding the size of the mouth. For the same reason, the rami of the lower jaw, which consist of dentary, splenial, angular, and articular elements, with the addition of a coronoid in the boas and a few other small families, are connected at the symphysis by a very extensible elastic ligament.

The hyoid apparatus is reduced to a pair of cartilaginous filaments situated below the trachea, and united in front.

There are various modifications according to the genera. A large hole may be present between the frontal bones and the basisphenoid (&quot;Psammophis&quot;, &quot;Coelopeltis&quot;); the maxillary may be much abbreviated and movable vertically, as in the Viperidae; the pterygoids may taper and converge posteriorly, without any connection with the quadrate, as in the Amblycephalidae; the supratemporal may be much reduced, and wedged in between the adjacent bones of the cranium; the quadrate may be short or extremely large; the prefrontals may join in a median suture in front of the frontals; the dentary may be freely movable, and detached from the articular posteriorly.

The deviation from the normal type is much greater still when we consider the degraded wormlike members of the families Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae, in which the skull is very compact and the maxillary much reduced. In the former this bone is loosely attached to the lower aspect of the cranium; in the latter, it borders the mouth and is suturally joined to the premaxillary and the prefrontal. Both the transverse bone and the supratemporal are absent, but the coronoid element is present in the mandible.

===Joints of the snake skull===

*Red A: the joint between the mandible and quadrate. It is analogous to the joint in mammalian jaws.
*Red B: the joint between the quadrate and the supratemporal. It is highly mobile in most directions, allowing a wider gape (i.e., the snake can open its mouth wider) and greater jaw flexibility.
*Red C: the joint between the prefrontal and maxilla. It allows the maxilla to pivot in the plane of the photograph, and while it does not increase gape, it does facilitate the complex action by which the snake draws prey into its mouth.
*Green A: the joint between the frontal bone and nasal bone. It allows the nose to upturn slightly, increasing gape and assisting in swallowing.
*Green B: allows the lower jaws to bow outwards, further increasing the gape.
*Blue: the joint between the supratemporal and parietal. Immobile, except for &quot;Dasypeltis&quot;.

===Snake dentition===
In most snakes, teeth are located on the dentary of the lower jaw, the maxilla, the palatine bone and the lateral pterygoid plate. The latter form an &quot;inner row&quot; of teeth that can move separately from the rest of the jaws and are used to help &quot;walk&quot; the jaws over prey. Several snake lineages have evolved venom which is typically delivered by specialized teeth called fangs located on the maxilla.

Most snakes can be placed into one of four groups, based on their teeth, which correlate strongly with venom and lineage.

====Aglyph====
Aglyphous snakes (&quot;lacking grooves&quot;) have no specialized teeth; each tooth is similar in shape and often size. When teeth vary in size, as in some bird eaters, they do not vary in shape. Most aglyphous snakes are non-venomous; some, like &quot;Thamnophis&quot;, are considered mildly venomous. The feature is not a synapomorphy.

====Opisthoglyph====
Opisthoglyphous (&quot;rearward grooves&quot;) snakes possess venom injected by a pair of enlarged teeth at the back of the maxillae, which normally angle backward and are grooved to channel venom into the puncture. Since these fangs are not located at the front of the mouth, this arrangement is vernacularly called &quot;rear-fanged&quot;. In order to envenomate prey, an opisthoglyphous snake must move the prey into the rear of its mouth and then penetrate it with its fangs, presenting difficulties with large prey although they can quickly move smaller prey into position. The opisthoglyphous dentition appears at least two times in the history of snakes. The venom of some opisthoglyphous snakes is strong enough to harm humans; notably, herpetologists Karl Schmidt and Robert Mertens were killed by a boomslang and a twig snake, respectively, after each underestimated the effects of the bite and failed to seek medical help. Opisthoglyphous snakes are found mostly in the families Colubridae and Homalopsidae. 

====Proteroglyph====
Proteroglyphous snakes (&quot;forward grooved&quot;) have shortened maxillae bearing few teeth except for a substantially enlarged fang pointing downwards and completely folded around the venom channel, forming a hollow needle. Because the fangs are only a fraction of an inch long in even the largest species, these snakes must hang on, at least momentarily, as they inject their venom. Some spitting cobras have modified fang tips allowing them to spray venom at an attacker&#x27;s eyes. This form of dentition is unique to elapids. 

====Solenoglyph====
Solenoglyphous snakes (&quot;pipe grooved&quot;) have the most advanced venom delivery method of any snake. Each maxilla is reduced to a nub supporting a single hollow fang tooth. The fangs, which can be as long as half the length of the head, are folded against the roof of the mouth, pointing posteriorly. The skull has a series of interacting elements that ensure that the fangs rotate into biting position when the jaws open. Solenoglyphous snakes open their mouths almost 180 degrees, and the fangs swing into a position to allow them to penetrate deep into the prey. While solenoglyph venom is typically less toxic than that of proteroglyphs, this system allows them to deeply inject large quantities of venom. This form of dentition is unique to vipers. 

====Exceptions====
A few snakes do not conform to these categories. &quot;Atractaspis&quot; is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, allowing it to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps allowing it to hunt in small tunnels. Scolecophidia (blind burrowing snakes) typically have few teeth, often only in the upper or lower jaw.

====Informal or popular terminology====
Common names for the various types of snake dentition originate largely from older literature, but still are encountered in informal publications. Aglyphous snakes are commonly called fangless; opisthoglyphous snakes rear-fanged or back-fanged; and both Proteroglyphous and Solenoglyphous snakes are referred to as front-fanged.

===Taxonomic key of skull modifications===
Modifications of the skull in the European genera:

*I. Quadrate articulating with the cranium, supratemporal absent; mandible much shorter than the skull, with coronoid bone; maxillary small, on lower aspect of cranium; pterygoids not extending to quadrate; nasals forming long sutures with the premaxillary, prefrontals, and frontal: &quot;Typhlops&quot;.
*II. Quadrate suspended from the supratemporal; mandible at least as long as the skull; pterygoids extending to quadrate or mandible.
:*A. Mandible with coronoid bone; nasals in sutural contact with frontals and prefrontals; transverse bone short, not projecting much beyond cranium; maxillary not half as long as mandible, which is not longer than skull (to occiput): &quot;Eryx&quot;.

::*1. Maxillary elongate, not movable vertically.
:::*a. Maxillary half as long as mandible.

==Vertebrae and ribs==
A snake has from 175 to more than 400 vertebrae in its backbone. The means by which vertebrae are secured are twofold: either a ball and socket joint, or zygopophyses, which stick out from each vertebra to poke rear-pointing projections from the vertebrae ahead of it. This results in a spine well-adapted to the snake&#x27;s method of movement. 

The vertebral column consists of an atlas (composed of two vertebrae) without ribs; numerous precaudal vertebrae, all of which, except the first or first three, bear long, movable, curved ribs with a small posterior tubercle at the base, the last of these ribs sometimes forked; two to ten so-called lumbar vertebrae without ribs, but with bifurcate transverse processes (lymphapophyses) enclosing the lymphatic vessels; and a number of ribless caudal vertebrae with simple transverse processes. When bifid, the ribs or transverse processes have the branches regularly superposed.

The centra have the usual ball and socket joint, with the nearly hemispherical or transversely elliptic condyle at the back (procoelous vertebrae), while the neural arch is provided with additional articular surfaces in the form of pre- and post-zygapophyses, broad, flattened, and overlapping, and of a pair of anterior wedge-shaped processes called zygosphene, fitting into a pair of corresponding concavities, zygantrum, just below the base of the neural spine. Thus the vertebrae of snakes articulate with each other by eight joints in addition to the cup-and-ball on the centrum, and interlock by parts reciprocally receiving and entering one another, like the mortise and tenon joints. The precaudal vertebrae have a more or less high neural spine which, as a rare exception (Xenopholis), may be expanded and plate-like above, and short or moderately long transverse processes to which the ribs are attached by a single facet. The centra of the anterior vertebrae emit more or less developed descending processes, or haemapophyses, which are sometimes continued throughout, as in &quot;Tropidonotus&quot;, &quot;Vipera&quot;, and &quot;Ancistrodon&quot;, among European genera.

In the caudal region, elongate transverse processes take the place of ribs, and the haemapophyses are paired, one on each side of the haemal canal. In the rattlesnakes the seven or eight last vertebrae are enlarged and fused into one.

==Vestigial limbs==

No living snake shows any remains of the pectoral arch, but remains of the pelvis are found in:

*Boas and Pythons: a long ilium, attached to the lower branch of the first bifurcate transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae, bearing three short bones, the longest of which, regarded as the femur, terminates in a claw-like pelvic spur which usually appears externally on each side of the cloaca.
*Leptotyphlopidae: ilium, pubis, and ischium, and rudimentary femur, the ischium forming a ventral symphysis.
*Aniliidae
*Typhlopidae: a single bone on each side.

<text>Gambart is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Insularum, near the central region of the Moon. It is named after French astronomer Jean-Félix Adolphe Gambart. It can be located to the south-southeast of the prominent ray crater Copernicus. In the past, the floor of Gambart has been flooded with lava, leaving a relatively flat surface surrounded by a smooth but somewhat polygon-shaped outer rim. To the southwest of Gambart is an area of hilly terrain deposited from ejecta during the Mare Imbrium impact, known as the Fra Mauro Formation.

The smaller Gambart C crater is located to the northeast of Gambart itself. Roughly between Gambart and Gambart C is a lunar dome, a type of shield volcano. The Surveyor 2 probe crashed to the northeast of Gambart C.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gambart.

<text>Area codes 508 and 774 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. state of Massachusetts. The numbering plan area comprises south-central and most of southeastern Massachusetts (LATA 128). It includes Worcester, Outer south and southwest Greater Boston (such as the MetroWest region), as well as Fall River, New Bedford, Cape Cod, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket.

==History==
Massachusetts was originally divided into two numbering plan areas, when AT&amp;T published the configuration of the first nationwide telephone numbering plan for Operator Toll Dialing in 1947. Area code 617 was assigned to the eastern two-thirds of Massachusetts from roughly the western end of Worcester County to Boston, The Cape and Islands, and the South Coast, while the western part received area code 413.

Area code 508 was activated for service on July 16, 1988, in an area code split of 617, with a semicircle around Boston retaining 617 and the central offices in the northern, western, and southern parts of the area being reassigned to area code 508. Permissive dialing of 617 and 508 continued until January 1, 1989.

On September 1, 1997, numbering plan area 508 was split, whereby area code 978 was assigned to the northern part of the service area.

Area code 774 was added to the 508 numbering plan area on May 2, 2001, forming an overlay complex and making ten-digit dialing mandatory for all calls.

Some mobile telephone numbers assigned in the 1990s in communities in the former northern half of 508 (now the 978 area code) kept the area code after the split.

As of 2018, NPA 508/774 is projected to be exhausted by 2045.

==Service area==
The numbering plan area of area codes 508 and 774 includes the southern parts of the regions of Worcester County and MetroWest, as well as Cape Cod, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and the South Coast.

The major towns and cities are Attleboro, Barnstable, Bridgewater, Brockton, Dartmouth, Fall River, Framingham, Franklin, New Bedford, Plymouth, Taunton, and Worcester.

<text>Gärtner is the lava-flooded remnant of a crater in the northeast part of the Moon. It is located on the northern edge of the Mare Frigoris. The southern half of the formation is completely missing, and Gärtner forms a semi-circular basin along the edges of the lunar mare. To the north lies the crater Democritus.

The surviving parts of the crater rim are heavily worn and eroded, with notches and indentations formed by past impacts. The floor has a few low rises in the northern half. A rille designated Rima Gärtner runs from the midpoint of the crater toward the northeast rim, for a total length of about 30 kilometers. The bowl-shaped craterlet Gärtner D is located near the midpoint between the two ends of the crater rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gärtner.

<doc id="999649" wikidata="Q7593163" url="?curid=999649" title="St George's Cricket Club">
<text>The St George&#x27;s Cricket Club, also referred to as the St George Cricket Club, was the leading cricket club in the United States from the 1840s to the 1870s. Founded in 1839, with assistance from prominent members of the St George&#x27;s Society of New York, it was originally located in Manhattan, New York, and later moved to Hoboken, New Jersey. Nicknamed the &quot;Dragon Slayers&quot;, in 1844 the club hosted the first international cricket match, between teams representing Canada and the United States. It disbanded in 1898.

==History==
The St George&#x27;s Cricket Club (SGCC) was founded in Manhattan, New York. As recalled in 1894 by one of the SGCC&#x27;s early players, Robert Waller, the club&#x27;s name was not adopted until St George&#x27;s Day (April 23) 1840, although it had been formed the previous year. However, according to Henry Chadwick, its first match was played (as &quot;New York&quot; against &quot;Long Island&quot;) on October 22–23, 1838. In July 1840, an advert was placed in the &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, stating that the SGCC was &quot;open to play a friendly Match between any Club, or any eleven players in the United States, for a sum not less than $100, or over $500&quot; (a &quot;Match&quot; was to consist of one game in New York, and another at any location between Philadelphia and Troy). On September 24–25, 1844, it hosted the first international cricket match, between Canada and the United States.

Most of its playing members were British-born and excluded Americans from participating in their &quot;English game&quot;. The local resentment of this English social exclusivity amongst New York ball players may have been the impetus for cricket to be designated as an &quot;English&quot; game in the US, though it had been played for over a century at the time. The SGCC club traveled to Canada on several occasions in the 1850s, encouraging a touring tradition for American sports which culminated in George Parr&#x27;s All-England XI visiting New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal in 1859. This was the first occasion that a professional team of players in any sport had played in the United States. The All England Team of professionals played a US XXII team that included five SGCC players.

In 1866, it was reported that the SGCC had 200–300 members and was in a &quot;flourishing condition&quot;, being able to field &quot;three excellent elevens&quot;. It continued its dominant New York cricket organizational role until 1876, when the founding of the New York Metropolitan league and the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club at Walker Park ushered in a new era of league cricket in New York. Its first ground was located in Midtown Manhattan off of Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) between 30th and 31st Street. The ground was located behind the Casper Samler farmstead, which was later replaced by the Gilsey Hotel. By November 1845, the SGCC was looking for another venue as this site had been &quot;cut through&quot; by the opening of Fifth Avenue. On May 4, 1846, it was reported that the club had purchased a new ground &quot;near the Red House on the Harlem Road&quot;, which it was in the process of &quot;levelling and filling&quot;. The planned opening on St George&#x27;s Day had already been postponed due to the &quot;unfit state&quot; of the ground, but on May 18 it was advertised that a match would take place two days later. Known colloquially and referred to in the press as the &quot;Red House&quot; ground, the club&#x27;s new home was situated to the east of Third Avenue, where 105th and 106th streets now cross First Avenue (as laid out in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811). Red House hosted domestic competitions between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as well as international matches with Canadian teams, including a match between the United States and Canada in 1853.

In 1854, the SGCC moved across the Hudson River to New Jersey, where beginning on May 10, they were invited to play their matches on the ground of the New York Cricket Club. After the Civil War, St George&#x27;s was slated to get a ground in Central Park before moving to Hudson City. St George&#x27;s opponents included the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, the Philadelphia Cricket Club, and the Toronto Cricket Club. George Wright includes a picture of St George&#x27;s cricket grounds in his biography.

George Wright&#x27;s older brother Harry also played for St George&#x27;s team. The Wrights&#x27; father, Samuel, was the professional groundskeeper for the team and is depicted, along with his son Harry, in a famous daguerreotype holding a cricket bat while Harry holds a baseball bat.

The SGCC did not send a representative to the first national cricket convention, held in Philadelphia in 1878, when the Cricketers&#x27; Association of the United States was established. However, it did participate the next year, when a club member was elected as one of the organisation&#x27;s two vice-presidents.

===Tennis and the decline of cricket===

In May 1881, the SGCC became one of the founding members of the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA), with club treasurer Berkley Mostyn being elected to the committee. The following year, the ground was expanded to provide a number of extra courts, and by 1884 there were 20 in total. St George&#x27;s approached the USLTA with the idea of holding the country&#x27;s first regional tennis tournament, and duly hosted the inaugural Middle States Tennis Championship on June 10–12, 1885. A clay court was amongst several further courts added in 1887.

The popularity of tennis increased rapidly during 1880s, and St George&#x27;s was not the only club to experience a corresponding decline in the importance of cricket to its members. Indeed, by 1888, the SGCC had become &quot;so absorbed&quot; in the new sport that the press considered the playing of a cricket match to be a noteworthy event. Whilst a revival of interest in the game was reported that year, a writer in &quot;The Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine noted in 1891 that it had been had supplanted by tennis, commenting that &quot;unless its membership be frequently recruited by newly arriving Englishmen, the probability is that cricket will survive only in the club’s title&quot;. This was a prophetic observation, as despite efforts to prolong its existence, the cricket team disbanded around the beginning of June 1898. The club continued to provide tennis facilities, and following an overhaul of the ground in 1902 by Richard Stevens, the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that its grass courts were &quot;without question the finest in the country&quot;.

<doc id="999653" wikidata="Q5905576" url="?curid=999653" title="Horse Under Water">
<text>Horse Under Water (1963) is the second of several Len Deighton spy novels featuring an unnamed British intelligence officer. It was preceded by &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; and followed by &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot;.

==Background==
The novel is set mostly in a small fishing village in Portugal, during the António de Oliveira Salazar dictatorship. It retains the style of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; — multiple plots twists, Gauloises cigarettes, the grime- and soot-stained British winter. In common with several of Deighton&#x27;s other early novels, the chapter headings have a running theme. In &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; these are crossword puzzle clues, reflecting the protagonist&#x27;s habit of endlessly writing and replacing words in crossword puzzles. The first edition of &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; published by Jonathan Cape was shorter than the later Penguin edition, which included a detailed description of the anonymous British agent&#x27;s diving course and also introduced characters later seen in the book, such as Chief Petty Officer Edwardes.

==Plot==
The plot centres on retrieving items from a Type XXI U-boat sunk off the Portuguese coast in the last days of World War II. Initially, the items are forged British and American currency, for financing a revolution in Portugal on the cheap. Later, it switches to heroin (the &quot;Horse&quot; of the title), and eventually it is revealed that the true interest is in the &quot;Weiss list&quot; – a list of Britons prepared to help the Third Reich set up a puppet government in Britain, should Germany prevail. Thrown into the mix is secret &quot;ice melting&quot; technology, which could be vital to the missile submarines then beginning to hide under the Arctic sea ice.

==Technology==
The secret weather buoys generally used by the wartime Kriegsmarine were not as sophisticated as the one described in the novel. They were not submersible and, at the end of their expected battery life of two months, they were supposed to self-destruct with an explosive charge. See also Weather Station Kurt.

==Film adaptation==
A 1968 film adaptation of &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; was planned, but following the poor reception of &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; it was abandoned.

<text>Nichollstown and Berry Islands was a district of the Bahamas. It included the northern portion of the island of Andros, with a population of 3,444 in the year 2000, as well as the nearby Berry Islands, which had a population of 809 at that time [1]. Since 1996, the Berry Islands have been established as a separate district, while the Nichollstown area has been redefined as part of the district of North Andros [2].

Since 1996 the Berry Islands have been constituted as a separate district, and with the Nicholls Town area now the district of North Andros.

<text>Goclenius is a lunar impact crater that is located near the west edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It lies to the southeast of the lava-flooded crater Gutenberg, and north of Magelhaens. To the northwest is a parallel rille system that follow a course toward the northwest, running for a length of up to 240 kilometers. This feature is named the Rimae Goclenius.

The rim of this crater is worn, distorted and irregular, having a somewhat egg-like outline. The crater floor has been covered in lava, and a rille cuts across the floor towards the northwest, in the same direction as the other members of the Rimae Goclenius. A similar rille lies across the floor of Gutenberg, and it is likely that these features were all formed at the same time, after the original craters were created.

There is a low central rise located to the northwest of the crater&#x27;s midpoint.

The crater is named for Rudolf Goclenius, Jr. (1572–1621), German physician and professor of physics, medicine and mathematics.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Goclenius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Goclenius A — &quot;See&quot; Ibn Battuta.

<text>Lal Nishan Party (Red Flag Party, LNP) was a communist political party in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It was founded in 1965. The LNP&#x27;s main work was trade union activism. The trade union of the party was called Sarva Shramik Sangh (SSS). The party publication was called &quot;Nave Parva&quot;. Earlier, SSS published a Marathi daily newspaper from Pune called &quot;Shramik Vichar&quot;. During the 1980s, the LNP developed a close cooperation with Kamgar Aghadi.

In 1988, a split occurred when a hardline section, critical of the Perestroika, broke away and formed the Lal Nishan Party (Leninvadi). The LNP participated in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists. In 2017 August, the LNP merged with the Communist Party of India.

<text>Guericke is the remnant of a lunar impact crater at the north part of the Mare Nubium. It is named after German scientist Otto von Guericke. To the north-northwest lies the large Fra Mauro crater, along with the co-joined craters Parry and Bonpland. To the east are the craters Kundt and Davy.

The surviving rim of Guericke has been worn, battered, and partly submerged by the basaltic lava that covers the floor. The wall is now little more than a circular series of ridges that join with rises that flow to the north, northwest, and south. The flooded crater remnant Guericke F is attached to the southwest exterior. The interior flood has a few small rises in the otherwise nearly flat surface. Two craters (Guericke D and H) mark the floor in the southwest quadrant.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Guericke.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Guericke C — &quot;See&quot; Kundt.

<text>The Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa is a comprehensive dictionary of the Portuguese language, published in Brazil, first compiled by Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira. It is popularly known as the Dicionário Aurélio, or simply Aurélio or Aurelião (&quot;Big &quot;Aurélio&quot;&quot;&#x27;).

The first edition was published in 1975, and it has since then re-printed dozens of times, and also published in electronic form. According to publisher&#x27;s data, it had sold over 5 million copies by 1986, and over 40 million by 2005 (counting all derivative works and special editions). The 4th edition published in 2009 is written in the new orthography (o Novo Acordo da Língua Portuguesa de 7 de maio de 2008), (with CD).

==Publication history==

The second edition (copyright date 1986; 32nd reprinting, 1995) has 1809 pages plus front matter and bibliography, and was published by Editora Nova Fronteira. This edition was organized by Margarida dos Anjos, Marina Baird Ferreira (Aurélio&#x27;s widow), Elza Tavares Ferreira, Joaquim Campelo Marques, Stella Rodrigo Octávio Moutinho, and Giovani Mafra e Silva.

A third edition, &quot;Dicionário Aurélio Século XXI&quot;, was published in 2001.

In 2004 a new publisher (Positivo) acquired the rights to distribute the dictionary with the title &quot;Novo Dicionário Aurélio da Língua Portuguesa&quot;, with 435,000 entries.

This can be achieved with intentional malapropism (e.g. replacing &quot;erection&quot; for &quot;election&quot;), enallage (giving a sentence the wrong form, eg. &quot;we was robbed!&quot;), or simply replacing a letter with another letter (for example, in English, &quot;k&quot; replacing &quot;c&quot;), or symbol (&quot;$&quot; replacing &quot;s&quot;). Satiric misspelling is found widely today in informal writing on the Internet, but is also made in some serious political writing that opposes the status quo.
== &quot;K&quot; replacing &quot;c&quot; ==
===In political writing===
Replacing the letter &quot;c&quot; with &quot;k&quot; in the first letter of a word was used by the Ku Klux Klan during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group. For something similar in the writing of groups opposed to the KKK, see , below.

In the 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, the Yippies sometimes used &quot;Amerika&quot; rather than &quot;America&quot; in referring to the United States. According to &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot;, it was an allusion to the Russian and German spellings of the word and intended to be suggestive of fascism and authoritarianism.
A similar usage in Italian, Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese is to write &quot;okupa&quot; rather than &quot;ocupa&quot; (often on a building or area occupied by squatters), referring to the name adopted by &quot;okupación&quot; activist groups. It stems from a combination of English borrowings with k in them to those languages, and Spanish anarchist and punk movements which used &quot;k&quot; to signal rebellion.

===In humor===
Replacing &quot;c&quot; with &quot;k&quot; was at the center of a Monty Python joke from the Travel Agent sketch. Eric Idle&#x27;s character has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in &quot;blassified&quot; instead of &quot;classified&quot;. Michael Palin asks him if he can say the letter K; Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C. Idle replies: &quot;what, you mean, pronounce &#x27;blassified&#x27; with a K? [...] Klassified. [...] Oh, it&#x27;s very good! I never thought of that before! What a silly bunt!&quot;

===&quot;KKK&quot; replacing &quot;c&quot; or &quot;k&quot;===
A common satiric usage of the letters &quot;KKK&quot; is the spelling of &quot;America&quot; as Amerikkka, alluding to the Ku Klux Klan, referring to underlying racism in American society. The earliest known usage of &quot;Amerikkka&quot; recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is in July 1970, in an African-American magazine called &quot;Black World&quot;.

The spelling &quot;Amerikkka&quot; came into greater use after the 1990 release of the gangsta rap album &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; by Ice Cube.
The letters &quot;KKK&quot; have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:
* &quot;Republikkkan&quot; (U.S. Republican Party)
* &quot;Demokkkrat&quot; (U.S. Democratic Party)
* &quot;KKKapitalism&quot; (capitalism)
* &quot;David DuKKKe&quot; (David Duke), former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, candidate for United States Senate, candidate for Governor of Louisiana, and antisemitic conspiracy theorist

==Currency signs==

Currency symbols like €, $ and £ can be inserted in place of the letters &quot;E&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;L&quot; respectively to indicate plutocracy, greed, corruption, or the perceived immoral, unethical, or pathological accumulation of money. For example:
* &quot;Bu$h&quot; (for George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, or the Bush family)
* Congre$$ (for United States Congress)
* &quot;Co$&quot; or &quot;$cientology&quot; (for the Church of Scientology): see also Scientology controversies.
* &quot;Di$ney&quot; and &quot;Di$neyland&quot; (for The Walt Disney Company and Disneyland): see also Criticism of the Walt Disney Company and Disneyland § Tickets
* &quot;E$$o&quot; (for Esso): Used by the UK-based Stop Esso campaign encouraging people to boycott Esso, in protest against Esso&#x27;s opposition to the Kyoto Protocol.
* &quot;€urope&quot; (for Europe)
*Ke$ha (singer-songwriter): adopted the dollar sign in her name while financially struggling as an ironic gesture.
*&quot;Micro$oft&quot;, &quot;M$&quot;, &quot;M$FT&quot; (for Microsoft): see also Criticism of Microsoft
* &quot;$ony&quot; (for Sony)
*&quot;United $tates&quot; (for the United States)
*&quot;£$€&quot; for the London School of Economics

==Word-in-word==
Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:
* After the controversial 2000 United States presidential election, the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as &quot;pResident&quot; and &quot;(p)resident&quot; for George W. Bush. The same effects were also used for Bill Clinton during and after Clinton&#x27;s impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the &quot;resident&quot; of the White House rather than the legitimate leader.
* The controversial United States law &quot;USA PATRIOT Act&quot; is sometimes called &quot;USA PAT RIOT Act&quot; or &quot;(Pat)Riot Act&quot; by its opponents. This is done to avoid using the common term &quot;Patriot Act&quot;, which implies the law is patriotic.
* Feminist theologian Mary Daly has used a slash to make a point about patriarchy: &quot;gyn/ecology&quot;, &quot;stag/nation&quot;, &quot;the/rapist&quot;.
* In French, where &quot;con&quot; is an insulting word meaning &quot;moron&quot;, the word &quot;conservateur&quot; (conservative) has been written &quot;con-servateur&quot;, &quot;con... servateur&quot;, or &quot;con(servateur)&quot;. The American English term &quot;neo-con&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;neo-conservative&quot;, becomes a convenient pun when used in French. In English, the first syllable of &quot;con&quot;servative can be emphasized to suggest a con artist.
* Filipino netizens gave Senator Ramon &quot;Bong&quot; Revilla Jr. the derisive nickname &quot;MandaramBONG&quot; (Filipino word for plunderer) to highlight allegations that he pocketed pork barrel funds through the use of fake non-government organizations.
*Jair Bolsonaro has been called BolsoNero, due to the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires and indifference to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==In internet memes==

===Lolcats===
In the mid-2000s, lolcat image macros were captioned with deliberate misspellings, known as &quot;lolspeak&quot;, such as a cat asking &quot;I can haz cheezburger?&quot; Blogger Anil Dash described the intentionally poor spelling and fractured grammar as &quot;kitty pidgin&quot;. 

===&quot;B&quot; emoji replacing hard consonants===
The negative squared letter B (🅱️; originally used to represent blood type B) can be used to replace hard consonants as an internet meme. This originates from the practice of members of the Bloods replacing the letter &quot;C&quot; with the letter &quot;B&quot;, but has been extended to any consonant. Common examples are:

* Ni🅱️🅱️a, replacing &quot;nigga&quot;. Some non-black people have been criticised for using this as if the taboo around the word did not apply.
*🅱️loods for Bloods.
*🅱️eter for Peter Griffin.

===Misspelled animal names===
Various different instances of intentional misspellings of animal names have been made as internet memes. The mid-2000s lolcat memes used spellings such as &quot;kitteh&quot; for kitty.

The internet slang of DoggoLingo, which appeared around the same time, spells dog as &quot;doggo&quot; and also includes respelled words for &quot;puppy&quot; (&quot;pupper&quot;) and other animals such as &quot;bird&quot; (&quot;birb&quot;) and &quot;snake&quot; (&quot;snek&quot;). Respellings in DoggoLingo usually alter the pronunciation of the word.

== Other significant respellings ==
Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.

Journalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.

The British political satire magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; has a long-standing theme of insulting the law firm Carter-Ruck by replacing the R with an F to read Carter-Fuck. The law firm once requested that Private Eye cease spelling its name like that; the magazine then started spelling it &quot;Farter-Fuck&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Private Eye&quot; often refers to &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;The Grauniad&quot;, due to the newspaper&#x27;s early reputation for typographical errors.

===Backronyms===

Plays on acronyms and initialisms are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, Richard Stallman and other Free Software Foundation executives often refer to digital rights management as &quot;digital &quot;restrictions&quot; management&quot;. a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user&#x27;s ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times. Likewise, the National Security Agency is often referred to as the &quot;National &quot;Surveillance&quot; Agency&quot; and sometimes &quot;National Socialist Agency&quot; by opponents of its PRISM program, who view it as dystopian encroachment on personal privacy.

<text>Gutenberg is a lunar impact crater that lies along the west edge of Mare Fecunditatis, in the eastern part of the visible Moon. It is named after German inventor Johannes Gutenberg. To the southeast are the craters Goclenius, Magelhaens and Colombo. To the west-southwest is the crater Gaudibert, across the Montes Pyrenaeus that run south from Gutenberg.
The rim of Gutenberg is worn and eroded, most notably in the east where it is broken by the overlapping crater Gutenberg E. This crater in turn has gaps in its southeast and southwest rims, forming a passage to the lunar mare to the east. There are also clefts and valleys in the southern rim where it joins Gutenberg C. The crater Gutenberg A intrudes into the southwest rim.

The floors of Gutenberg and Gutenberg E have been flooded in the past by lava, forming a relatively flat plain across the bottom. This surface is broken across the northeast by a pair of clefts that form a part of the Rimae Goclenius. These extend northwest from the Goclenius region. The central rise of Gutenberg is a semi-circular range of hills that are the most prominent in the south, and the concave part lies open to the east. The floor is otherwise not marred by any significant craters.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gutenberg.

<doc id="999675" wikidata="Q2608710" url="?curid=999675" title="Muqam">
<text>A Muqam (; ) is the melody type used in the music of the Uyghurs, that is, a musical mode and set of melodic formulas used to guide improvisation and composition.

==Twelve muqams==
The twelve muqams are: 
#Rak (; , &quot;Lākè&quot;)
#Chebbiyat (; , &quot;Qiěbǐyǎtè&quot;)
#Sëgah (; , &quot;Sīgǎ&quot;)
#Chahargah (; , &quot;Qiàěrgǎ&quot;)
#Penjigah (; , &quot;Pāněrgǎ&quot;)
#Özhal (; , &quot;Wūzīhālēi&quot;)
#Ejem (; , &quot;Àiqiě&quot;)
#Oshaq (; , &quot;Wūxiàkè&quot;)
#Bayat (; , &quot;Bāyǎtí&quot;)
#Nawa (; , &quot;Nàwǎ&quot;)
#Mushawrek (; , &quot;Mùxiàwúláikè&quot;)
#Iraq (; , &quot;Yīlākè&quot;)

Each of the 12 muqams consists of a main section that begins with a long free rhythm introduction, followed by pieces with characteristic rhythmic patterns that gradually increase in speed. Each muqam consists of three parts, including naghma, dastan and mashrap. These pieces are arranged in the same sequence in each muqam, although not all muqams have the same pieces. These parts are known as &quot;teze, nuskha, small seliqe, jula, senem, large seliqe, peshru&quot; and &quot;tekit&quot;. Some have an associated instrumental piece known as a &quot;merghul&quot; (&quot;decoration&quot;) following it. Although each named piece has its characteristic rhythmic pattern, the melodies differ, so each piece is generally known by the muqam and the piece: for example, &quot;the Rak nuskha&quot; or &quot;the Segah jula&quot;. There are about 20 to 30 pieces of songs and musics, which might take approximately 2 hours to finish performing. It will take about 24 hours to perform all pieces of 12 muqams.

After the main section, there are two other sections, originally associated with other musical traditions, but included in muqams by performers such as Turdi Akhun and therefore included in the present 12 muqam tradition. The &quot;Dastan&quot; section includes songs from several of the romantic dastan narratives found widely in Central and South Asia and the Middle East. Each dastan song is followed by an instrumental märghul. The &quot;Meshrep&quot; section consists of more lively dance songs that were originally connected with the performances of sama by dervish musicians of Turkistan.

==History and preservation==
Some Chinese scholars believe that the Uyghur Muqam can be traced back to the &quot;Great Western Region Melody&quot; () developed during the Han (206 BCE–220 CE) and Tang (618–907) dynasties, from which it was imported and enjoyed in the courts of Central China. It is however more likely that it was influenced by the Arabic maqam modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of Eurasia and North Africa. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after their historic oasis towns which are currently in Xinjiang, such as Dolan, Ili, Kumul and Turpan. The most fully developed at this point is the Western Tarim region&#x27;s 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers Turdi Akhun and Omar Akhun among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish taksim performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The concubine Amannissa Khan of the Yarkent Khanate (1526–1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam, while reshaping its style to draw more from the indigenous traditions of the Tian Shan mountains and purging it of the Perso-Arabic. After the Chinese Communist Revolution, the state commissioned musicians Wan Tongshu and Turdi Akhun to record the Muqams on tape, so that it could not be lost. They published their first album in 1960. From 2004 to 2008, over 7,000 performers have collaborated in a Chinese state project to proliferate seminars, research projects and recordings of the Muqam.

In 2005, UNESCO designated The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

<text>The Eight Legged Groove Machine is the debut album by the Wonder Stuff, released in the UK on 8 August 1988. &quot;NME&quot; listed it as the 27th best album of the 1980s.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; opined that &quot;this is a great debut by a caustic if-we-knew-then &#x27;60s-style foursome, an irresistibly catchy recycledelic album that sounds like a world-weary Romantics—or the Flaming Groovies after 20 years in the coffee generation.&quot;

<text>Hansteen is a lunar impact crater that lies near the southwest edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. To the southeast is the flooded crater Billy. The rim of Hansteen is somewhat polygonal in form, especially along the eastern side. There are a few s along the northwestern inner wall. The inner floor contains several ridges, hills, and some grooves, many of which parallel the outer rim. There is a flat patch of lower-albedo material in the northeast part of the interior.

Paralleling the southwest outer wall is the brief rille designated Rima Hansteen, a formation with a length of about 25 kilometers. To the southeast of the crater rises Mons Hansteen, or Hansteen Alpha (α). This is roughly triangular in shape and occupies an area about 30 km across on the mare. This feature is younger than Hansteen crater and is thought to be an extrusion of volcanic material.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hansteen.

<text>Gana Abhiyan Orissa (Popular Campaign Odisha), also called Orissa Gana Abhiyan, was a political organization in the Indian state of Odisha. The organization was formed a splinter group of Socialist Unity Centre of India, when the local party leader Mayadhar Naik had been expelled from SUCI in the end of the 1990s. Naik claims that the expulsion was motivated by ideological differences, whereas SUCI claimed Naik was guilty of corruption.

GAO has worked to a large extent with organizing adivasis and dalits.

In the elections 1999 GAO did not launch any candidates of their own, but support &#x27;left and democratic forces&#x27;. Ahead of the 2004 a cooperation with the Indian National Congress was discussed. The exact status of the organization today is unclear, it might be that Naik joined Congress.

<text>Hercules is a prominent crater located in the northeast part of the Moon, to the west of the crater Atlas. It lies along the east edge of a southward extension in the Mare Frigoris. To the west across the mare is Bürg. To the south is the ruined crater Williams.

The interior walls of Hercules have multiple s, and there is a small outer . The crater floor has been flooded by lava in the past, and contains several areas of low albedo. The central peak has been buried, leaving only a low hill near the midpoint. The satellite crater Hercules G is located prominently just to the south of the center. The small crater Hercules E lies along the southern rim of Hercules.

Hercules is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

The name Hercules was formally recognized by the IAU in 1935.

In the past this crater has been reported as the site of some transient lunar phenomenon.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hercules.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Hercules A — &quot;See&quot; Keldysh.

<text>An oath of citizenship is an oath taken by immigrants that officially naturalizes immigrants into citizens. It is often the final step in this process, and is usually done in a ceremonial capacity. An oath of citizenship is designed to be a statement of patriotism and loyalty to the new country. In countries which retain a monarchical system of government, an oath of allegiance to the monarch is often required as well. Adding an oath to God to the end of an oath is usually optional.

==Oaths==

=== Belgium ===
Dutch version:&quot;Ik verklaar Belgisch staatsburger te willen worden en de Grondwet, de wetten van het Belgische volk en het Verdrag tot bescherming van de rechten van de mens en de fundamentele vrijheden te zullen naleven.&quot;French version:&quot;“Je déclare vouloir acquérir la nationalité belge et me soumettre à la Constitution, aux lois du peuple belge et à la Convention de sauvegarde des droits de l’homme et des libertés fondamentales.”&quot; The English translation:“I declare my desire to acquire the Belgian nationality and to submit myself to the Constitution, the laws of Belgium, and to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.”

===Brazil===
Portuguese version:Declaro expressamente que assumo o compromisso de bem cumprir os deveres de cidadão brasileiro, observando e respeitando os preceitos da Constituição Federal.The English translation:I expressly declare that I assume the commitment to well comply the Brazilian citizen duties, observing and respecting the principles of the Federal Constitution.

===Canada===

The Oath of Citizenship, or Citizenship Oath (in French: &quot;serment de citoyenneté&quot;), is a statement recited and signed by candidates who wish to become citizens of Canada. Administered at a ceremony presided over by assigned officers, most often a citizenship judge. The oath is a promise or declaration of fealty to Canada in the name of the Canadian monarch and a promise to abide by Canada&#x27;s laws and customs; upon signing the oath, citizenship is granted to the signer. New citizens must take the oath. As Canada is officially bilingual in English and French, the presiding official leads new citizens in both languages at citizenship ceremonies. It is mandatory that the presiding official and/or the citizenship officials observe each applicant reciting the oath.

English version:I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles the Third, King of Canada, His Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada, including the Constitution, which recognizes and affirms the Aboriginal and treaty rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, and fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.

French version: Je jure (ou j&#x27;affirme solennellement) que je serai fidèle et porterai sincère allégeance à Sa Majesté le Roi Charles Trois, Roi du Canada, à ses héritiers et successeurs, que j&#x27;observerai fidèlement les lois du Canada, y compris la Constitution, qui reconnaît et confirme les droits ancestraux ou issus de traités des Premières Nations, des Inuits et des Métis, et que je remplirai loyalement mes obligations de citoyen canadien.

===Colombia===
The Colombian Oath of Allegiance (Acta de Juramento), does not have an official text. The oath is usually made before a Mayor, if the applicant was born in a Latin American country, or the Governor if the applicant was born anywhere else, and is administered in the form of a question. In special cases the oath may also be taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canciller), or the President of the Republic. An example of an oath that is given is: 

Spanish Version:
&quot;Señor/Señora [inserte nombre aquí], ¿Jura usted que es de su libre voluntad ser colombiano(a) y como tal de cumplir, sostener y defender la Constitución y las leyes de la República de Colombia?&quot;

If the applicant responds in the affirmative, the oath taker finishes the oath by saying:

&quot;Si así lo hiciera, Dios y la patria os la premien, y si no, Él y Ella os lo(a) demanden.&quot;
English Translation: &quot;Mr/Mrs. [Insert Name Here]: Do you swear that you freely wish to become Colombian and as such to fulfill, uphold and defend the constitution and the laws of the Republic of Colombia?&quot;

If the applicant responds in the affirmative, the oath taker finishes the oath by saying:

&quot;If you do so, may God and the motherland reward you, and if not, may he and she demand it from you.&quot;

===Germany===
According to § 16 National Act the oath of citizenship reads as follows. German version:Ich erkläre feierlich, dass ich das Grundgesetz und die Gesetze der Bundesrepublik Deutschland achten und alles unterlassen werde, was ihr schaden könnte.English version:I solemnly declare that I will respect and observe the Basic Law and the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, and that I will refrain from any activity which might cause it harm. 

===Hungary===
Officially called the &quot;Oath of Allegiance&quot;.

Hungarian version:Én, [name] esküszöm, hogy Magyarországot hazámnak tekintem. Magyarországnak hű állampolgára leszek, az Alaptörvényt és a jogszabályokat tiszteletben tartom és megtartom. Hazámat erőmhöz mérten megvédem, képességeimnek megfelelően szolgálom. Isten engem úgy segéljen.English version:I, [name], do solemnly swear that I shall consider Hungary my homeland. I shall be a loyal citizen of the Republic of Hungary, and shall honour and observe its Constitution and laws. I shall defend my homeland in function with my force, and shall serve it to the best of my ability. So help me God!The &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; is the same with the exception of &quot;So help me God!&quot; [&quot;Isten engem úgy segéljen.&quot;] and is of equal value.

===India===
Officially called the &quot;Oath of Allegiance&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
English Version:I, [name] do solemnly affirm (or, swear in the name of God) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of India and fulfil my duties as a citizen of India.&lt;br&gt;
Hindi version:मैं...[नाम]...शपथ लेता/लेती हूँ (अथवा सत्यनिष्ठा से प्रतिज्ञान करता/करती हूँ) कि मैं भारत के संविधान के प्रति श्रद्धावान एवं सच्ची निष्ठा रखूँगा/रखूँगी, जो विधि द्वारा स्थापित है तथा भारत के नागरिक के रूप में भारत के कानूनों और अपने कर्तव्यों का निष्ठापूर्वक पालन करूँगा/करूँगी।

===Indonesia===

Indonesian oath of allegiance:Saya bersumpah (&quot;atau&quot; berjanji) bahwa saya melepaskan seluruhnya, segala kesetiaan kepada kekuasaan asing, bahwa saya mengaku dan menerima kekuasaan yang tertinggi dari Republik Indonesia dan akan menepati kesetiaan kepadanya, bahwa saya akan menjunjung tinggi Undang-undang Dasar dan hukum-hukum Republik Indonesia dan akan membelanya dengan sungguh-sungguh, bahwa saya memikul kewajiban ini dengan rela hati dan tidak akan mengurangi sedikitpun.

The English Translation: I swear (&quot;or&quot; promise) that I release all and every allegiance to foreign powers, that I acknowledge and accept the highest powers from the Republic of Indonesia and will fulfill allegiance upon them, that I will highly honor the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Indonesia and will solemnly defend them, that I assume these obligations freely and will not diminish them even a little.

===Ireland===
The Declaration of Fidelity to the Nation and Loyalty to the State is the final act in the naturalisation process. The declaration is as follows:

“I (name) having applied to the Minister for Justice and Equality for a certificate of naturalisation, hereby solemnly declare my fidelity to the Irish nation and my loyalty to the State. I undertake to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.”

===Israel===
Non-Jews who wish to become citizens by way of naturalization must take an oath reading:

: &quot;I declare that I will be a loyal national of the State of Israel.&quot;

===Italy===
In Italy, Article 54 of the Constitution states that every citizen has the duty to be loyal to the Republic and to uphold its Constitution and laws, while Provision XVIII requires every citizen to faithfully observe the Constitution as the fundamental law of the Republic. New citizens take an oath to that effect at the end of their naturalization process:

The oath in Italian is:
Giuro di essere fedele alla Repubblica e di osservare la Costituzione e le leggi dello Stato.&lt;br&gt;

The English translation of the oath is:
I swear to be loyal to the Republic and to observe the Constitution and the laws of the State.

===Jamaica===
I, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles the Third, His Heirs and Successors according to the Laws of Jamaica and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Jamaica and fulfil my duties as a citizen of Jamaica. So help me God.

===Netherlands===

Immigrants who have applied for Dutch citizenship by naturalization or by option must make a Declaration of Solidarity (&quot;Verklaring van verbondenheid&quot;) before they become citizens:

Ik zweer dat ik de grondwettelijke orde van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, haar vrijheden en rechten respecteer. En zweer de plichten die het staatsburgerschap met zich meebrengt getrouw te vervullen. Zo waarlijk helpe mij God almachtig. (Dutch)
&quot;I swear that I will respect the constitutional order of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its liberties and rights and I swear that I will faithfully fulfill the duties which this citizenship imposes on me. So help me God.&quot;

For those who are not religious or who so choose, the following affirmation is also an option:

Ik verklaar dat ik de grondwettelijke orde van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, haar vrijheden en rechten respecteer. En beloof de plichten die het staatsburgerschap met zich meebrengt getrouw te vervullen. Dat verklaar en beloof ik. (Dutch)
&quot;I declare that I will respect the constitutional order of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its liberties and rights and I declare and promise that I will faithfully fulfill the duties which this citizenship imposes on me. This I declare and promise.&quot;

===New Zealand===
According to New Zealand law, new citizens are given the option of taking the oath in either English or Maori when swearing in at a citizenship ceremony.

English versions:

Oath of allegiance:
I, [full name], swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His (or Her) Majesty [specify the name of the reigning Sovereign, as thus: King Charles the Third, King of New Zealand] His (or Her) heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of New Zealand and fulfil my duties as a New Zealand citizen. So help me God.
Those who object to adding &quot;God&quot; to the end of an oath may take the affirmation of allegiance instead:
I [name] solemnly and sincerely affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His (or Her) Majesty [specify the name of the reigning Sovereign, as thus: King Charles the Third, King of New Zealand] His (or Her) heirs and successors according to the law and that I will faithfully observe the laws of New Zealand and fulfil my duties as a New Zealand citizen.

Maori versions:

Oath of allegiance:
Tenei au, a [name], te oati nei ka pirihongo au, ka noho au hei haumi tuturu ki te Mana Roera, ki a Kuini Irihapeti te Tuarua, te Kuini o Aotearoa, ana kawa me ana piki turanga i raro i te ture, a, ka u marika au ki nga ture o Aotearoa, ka whakatutuki ano hoki i nga kawenga kei runga i a au hei kirirarau o Aotearoa, i runga i nga manaakitanga a te atua.
Affirmation of allegiance:
Tenei au, a [name], te whakau nei i runga i te ngakau pono, i te ngakau pai, ka pirihongo au, ka noho au hei haumi tuturu ki a Kuini Irihapeti te Tuarua, te Kuini o Aotearoa, ana kawa me ana piki turanga i raro i te ture, a, ka u marika au ki nga ture o Aotearoa, ka whakatutuki ano hoki i nga kawenga kei runga i a au hei kirirarau o Aotearoa.

===Philippines===
I, (name), solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines and obey the laws and legal orders promulgated by the duly constituted authorities of the Philippines and I hereby declare that I recognize and accept the supreme authority of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; and that I imposed this obligation upon myself voluntarily without mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God.

===Russia===
Russian version:
Я, Ф. И. О., добровольно и осознанно принимая гражданство РФ, клянусь соблюдать Конституцию и законодательство РФ, права и свободы ее граждан, исполнять обязанности гражданина РФ на благо государства и общества, защищать свободу и независимость РФ, быть верным России, уважать ее культуру, историю и традиции.
The English translation:
I, (surname, name, middle name), swear that, by taking the citizenship of the Russian Federation, I will observe the Constitution and laws of the Russian Federation, and the rights and freedoms of its citizens; that I shall fulfill my duties as a citizen of the Russian Federation for the welfare of the state and society; that I will protect the freedom and independence of the Russian Federation; and that I will be loyal to Russia and respect its culture, history and traditions.

===Singapore===
I, [name], do solemnly swear that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the Republic of Singapore, and that I will observe the laws and be a true, loyal and faithful citizen of Singapore.

===South Africa===
I, [name], do hereby solemnly declare that I will be loyal to the Republic of South Africa, promote all that will advance it and oppose all that may harm it, uphold and respect its Constitution and commit myself to the furtherance of the ideals and principles contained therein.

===Switzerland===
The oath is different in each canton. The formula below is the English translation of the one used in Geneva.
I swear or I solemnly promise: to be loyal to the Republic and the canton of Geneva as to the Swiss Confederation; to scrupulously observe the constitution and the laws; to respect the traditions, to justify my adhesion to the community of Geneva by my actions and behavior; and to contribute with all my power to keeping it free and prosperous.

===United Kingdom===

I, [name], [swear by Almighty God] [do solemnly, sincerely and truly affirm and declare] that, on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty Charles III, his heirs, and successors, according to law.

Since 1 January 2004, applicants for British citizenship are also required to make a pledge (see Pledges below).

===United States===

The United States Oath of Allegiance (officially referred to as the &quot;Oath of Allegiance,&quot; 8 C.F.R. Part 337 (2008)) is an oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens.
I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.

For people who object to taking an oath (or are not religious), the words &quot;on oath&quot; can be replaced with &quot;and solemnly affirm&quot;, and the words &quot;so help me God&quot; can be omitted.

==Pledges==
In some countries, a pledge is taken by a new citizen, as opposed to an oath. Pledges and oaths differ, the former being &quot;the things one swears by&quot; and the latter &quot;promises to which one binds oneself in swearing by things&quot;.

===Australia===

Officially called the &quot;Pledge of Commitment&quot;:

:From this time forward, [under God],
:I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,
:whose democratic beliefs I share,
:whose rights and liberties I respect, 
:and whose laws I will uphold and obey.

All new citizens have the choice of making the pledge with or without the words &quot;under God&quot;.

===Czech Republic===
Slibuji na svou čest věrnost České republice. Slibuji, že budu dodržovat její Ústavu a ostatní zákony České republiky.
I pledge my loyalty to the Czech Republic on my honor. I promise to abide by its Constitution and other laws of the Czech Republic.

===Norway===
Som norsk statsborger lover jeg troskap til mitt land Norge og det norske samfunnet, og jeg støtter demokratiet og menneskerettighetene og vil respektere landets lover.As a citizen of Norway I pledge loyalty to my country Norway and the Norwegian society, and I support democracy and human rights and will respect the laws of the country.Applicants for Norwegian citizenship are not required to take the oath; it is optional.

===Romania===
Jur să fiu devotat patriei și poporului român, să apăr drepturile și interesele naționale, să respect Constituția și legile RomânieiI pledge my devotion to my country and to the Romanian people, to defend the nation&#x27;s rights and interests, to respect the Constitution and laws of Romania

===United Kingdom===
Since 1 January 2004, applicants for British citizenship are also required, in addition to swearing the oath or affirmation of allegiance, to make a pledge to the United Kingdom as follows:I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.Persons acquiring British overseas territories citizenship make an equivalent pledge to the relevant British Overseas Territory. In the very unusual cases of an acquisition of British Overseas citizenship, or British subject status, no pledge would be required.

<doc id="999701" wikidata="Q1783502" url="?curid=999701" title="Rate of convergence">
<text>In mathematical analysis, particularly numerical analysis, the rate of convergence and order of convergence of a sequence that converges to a limit are any of several characterizations of how quickly that sequence approaches its limit. These are broadly divided into rates and orders of convergence that describe how quickly a sequence further approaches its limit once it is already close to it, called asymptotic rates and orders of convergence, and those that describe how quickly sequences approach their limits from starting points that are not necessarily close to their limits, called non-asymptotic rates and orders of convergence. 

Asymptotic behavior is particularly useful for deciding when to stop a sequence of numerical computations, for instance once a target precision has been reached with an iterative root-finding algorithm, but pre-asymptotic behavior is often crucial for determining whether to begin a sequence of computations at all, since it may be impossible or impractical to ever reach a target precision with a poorly chosen approach. Asymptotic rates and orders of convergence are the focus of this article. 

In practical numerical computations, asymptotic rates and orders of convergence follow two common conventions for two types of sequences: the first for sequences of iterations of an iterative numerical method and the second for sequences of successively more accurate numerical discretizations of a target. In formal mathematics, rates of convergence and orders of convergence are often described comparatively using asymptotic notation commonly called &quot;big O notation,&quot; which can be used to encompass both of the prior conventions; this is an application of asymptotic analysis. 

For iterative methods, a sequence formula_1 that converges to formula_2 is said to have asymptotic &quot;order of convergence&quot; formula_3 and asymptotic &quot;rate of convergence&quot; formula_4 if 
:formula_5
Where methodological precision is required, these rates and orders of convergence are known specifically as the rates and orders of Q-convergence, short for quotient-convergence, since the limit in question is a quotient of error terms. The rate of convergence formula_4 may also be called the &quot;asymptotic error constant&quot;, and some authors will use &quot;rate&quot; where this article uses &quot;order.&quot; Series acceleration methods are techniques for improving the rate of convergence of the sequence of partial sums of a series and possibly its order of convergence, also. 

Similar concepts are used for sequences of discretizations. For instance, ideally the solution of a differential equation discretized via a regular grid will converge to the solution of the continuous equation as the grid spacing goes to zero, and if so the asymptotic rate and order of that convergence are important properties of the gridding method. A sequence of approximate grid solutions formula_7 of some problem that converges to a true solution formula_8 with a corresponding sequence of regular grid spacings formula_9 that converge to 0 is said to have asymptotic &quot;order of convergence&quot; formula_10 and asymptotic &quot;rate of convergence&quot; formula_4 if

formula_12

where the absolute value symbols stand for a metric for the space of solutions such as the uniform norm. Similar definitions also apply for non-grid discretization schemes such as the polygon meshes of a finite element method or the basis sets in computational chemistry: in general, the appropriate definition of the asymptotic rate formula_4 will involve the asymptotic limit of the ratio of an approximation error term above to an asymptotic order formula_10 power of a discretization scale parameter below.

In general, comparatively, one sequence formula_15 that converges to a limit formula_16 is said to asymptotically converge more quickly than another sequence formula_17 that converges to a limit formula_18 if 

formula_19

and the two are said to asymptotically converge with the same order of convergence if the limit is any positive finite value. The two are said to be asymptotically equivalent if the limit is equal to one. These comparative definitions of rate and order of asymptotic convergence are fundamental in asymptotic analysis and find wide application in mathematical analysis as a whole, including numerical analysis, real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis. 

==Asymptotic rates of convergence for iterative methods==
=== Definitions ===
Suppose that the sequence formula_1 of iterates of an iterative method converges to the limit number formula_2 as formula_22. The sequence is said to &quot;converge with order formula_10 to formula_2&quot; and with a &quot;rate of convergence&quot; formula_4 if the formula_22 limit of quotients of absolute differences of sequential iterates formula_27 from their limit formula_2 satisfies

formula_29

Thus formula_15 converges Q-linearly with a convergence rate of formula_31; see the first plot of the figure below.

More generally, for any initial value formula_32 in the real numbers and a real number common ratio formula_33 between -1 and 1, a geometric progression formula_34 converges linearly with rate formula_35 and the sequence of partial sums of a geometric series formula_36 also converges linearly with rate formula_35. The same holds also for geometric progressions and geometric series parameterized by any complex numbers formula_38

The staggered geometric progression formula_39 using the floor function formula_40 that gives the largest integer that is less than or equal to formula_41 converges R-linearly to 0 with rate 1/2, but it does not converge Q-linearly; see the second plot of the figure below. The defining Q-linear convergence limits do not exist for this sequence because one subsequence of error quotients starting from odd steps converges to 1 and another subsequence of quotients starting from even steps converges to 1/4. When two subsequences of a sequence converge to different limits, the sequence does not itself converge to a limit. Generally, for any staggered geometric progression formula_42, the sequence will not converge Q-linearly but will converge R-linearly with rate formula_43 these examples demonstrate why the &quot;R&quot; in R-linear convergence is short for &quot;root.&quot;

The sequence 
formula_44
converges to zero Q-superlinearly. In fact, it is quadratically convergent with a quadratic convergence rate of 1. It is shown in the third plot of the figure below.

Finally, the sequence 
formula_45
converges to zero Q-sublinearly and logarithmically and its convergence is shown as the fourth plot of the figure below.

=== Convergence rates to fixed points of recurrent sequences ===
Recurrent sequences formula_46, called fixed point iterations, define discrete time autonomous dynamical systems and have important general applications in mathematics through various fixed-point theorems about their convergence behavior. When &quot;f&quot; is continuously differentiable, given a fixed point &quot;p&quot;, formula_47 such that formula_48, the fixed point is an attractive fixed point and the recurrent sequence will converge at least linearly to &quot;p&quot; for any starting value formula_49 sufficiently close to &quot;p&quot;. If formula_50 and formula_51, then the recurrent sequence will converge at least quadratically, and so on. If formula_52, then the fixed point is a repulsive fixed point and sequences cannot converge to &quot;p&quot; from its immediate neighborhoods, though they may still jump to &quot;p&quot; directly from outside of its local neighborhoods.

=== Order estimation ===
A practical method to calculate the order of convergence for a sequence generated by a fixed point iteration is to calculate the following sequence, which converges to the order formula_10:
formula_54

For numerical approximation of an exact value through a numerical method of order formula_10 see.

=== Accelerating convergence rates ===

Many methods exist to accelerate the convergence of a given sequence, i.e., to transform one sequence into a second sequence that converges more quickly to the same limit. Such techniques are in general known as &quot;series acceleration&quot; methods. These may reduce the computational costs of approximating the limits of the original sequences. One example of series acceleration by sequence transformation is Aitken&#x27;s delta-squared process. These methods in general, and in particular Aitken&#x27;s method, do not typically increase the order of convergence and thus they are useful only if initially the convergence is not faster than linear: if formula_1 converges linearly, Aitken&#x27;s method transforms it into a sequence formula_15 that still converges linearly (except for pathologically designed special cases), but faster in the sense that formula_58. On the other hand, if the convergence is already of order ≥ 2, Aitken&#x27;s method will bring no improvement.

==Asymptotic rates of convergence for discretization methods==
=== Definitions ===
A sequence of discretized approximations formula_7 of some continuous-domain function formula_8 that converges to this target, together with a corresponding sequence of discretization scale parameters formula_9 that converge to 0, is said to have asymptotic &quot;order of convergence&quot; formula_10 and asymptotic &quot;rate of convergence&quot; formula_4 if

formula_12

for some positive constants formula_4 and formula_10 and using formula_67 to stand for an appropriate distance metric on the space of solutions, most often either the uniform norm, the absolute difference, or the Euclidean distance. Discretization scale parameters may be spacings of a regular grid in space or in time, the inverse of the number of points of a grid in one dimension, an average or maximum distance between points in a polygon mesh, the single-dimension spacings of an irregular sparse grid, or a characteristic quantum of energy or momentum in a quantum mechanical basis set.

When all the discretizations are generated using a single common method, it is common to discuss the asymptotic rate and order of convergence for the method itself rather than any particular discrete sequences of discretized solutions. In these cases one considers a single abstract discretized solution formula_68 generated using the method with a scale parameter formula_69 and then the method is said to have asymptotic &quot;order of convergence&quot; formula_10 and asymptotic &quot;rate of convergence&quot; formula_4 if

formula_72

again for some positive constants formula_4 and formula_10 and an appropriate metric formula_75 This implies that the error of a discretization asymptotically scales like the discretization&#x27;s scale parameter to the formula_10 power, or formula_77 using asymptotic big O notation. More precisely, it implies the leading order error is formula_78 which can be expressed using asymptotic small o notation asformula_79

In some cases multiple rates and orders for the same method but with different choices of scale parameter may be important, for instance for finite difference methods based on multidimensional grids where the different dimensions have different grid spacings or for finite element methods based on polygon meshes where choosing either average distance between mesh points or maximum distance between mesh points as scale parameters may imply different orders of convergence. In some especially technical contexts, discretization methods&#x27; asymptotic rates and orders of convergence will be characterized by several scale parameters at once with the value of each scale parameter possibly affecting the asymptotic rate and order of convergence of the method with respect to the other scale parameters.

=== Example ===
Consider the ordinary differential equation
:formula_80

with initial condition formula_81. We can approximate a solution to this one-dimensional equation using a sequence formula_82 applying the forward Euler method for numerical discretization using any regular grid spacing formula_69 and grid points indexed by formula_84 as follows:
:formula_85

which implies the first-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients
:formula_86

Given formula_81, the sequence satisfying that recurrence is the geometric progression

formula_88

The exact analytical solution to the differential equation is formula_89, corresponding to the following Taylor expansion in formula_90:
formula_91

Therefore the error of the discrete approximation at each discrete point is
:formula_92
For any specific formula_93, given a sequence of forward Euler approximations formula_94, each using grid spacings formula_95 that divide formula_96 so that formula_97, one has

formula_98

for any sequence of grids with successively smaller grid spacings formula_95. Thus formula_94 converges to formula_101 pointwise with a convergence order formula_102 and asymptotic error constant formula_103 at each point formula_104 Similarly, the sequence converges uniformly with the same order and with rate formula_105 on any bounded interval of formula_106, but it does not converge uniformly on the unbounded set of all positive real values, formula_107

== Comparing asymptotic rates of convergence ==

=== Definitions ===
In asymptotic analysis in general, one sequence formula_108 that converges to a limit formula_2 is said to asymptotically converge to formula_2 with a faster order of convergence than another sequence formula_111 that converges to formula_2 in a shared metric space with distance metric formula_113 such as the real numbers or complex numbers with the ordinary absolute difference metrics, if

formula_114

the two are said to asymptotically converge to formula_2 with the same order of convergence if 

formula_116

for some positive finite constant formula_117 and the two are said to asymptotically converge to formula_2 with the same rate and order of convergence if 

formula_119

These comparative definitions of rate and order of asymptotic convergence are fundamental in asymptotic analysis. For the first two of these there are associated expressions in asymptotic O notation: the first is that formula_120 in small o notation and the second is that formula_121 in Knuth notation. The third is also called asymptotic equivalence, expressed formula_122

=== Examples ===
For any two geometric progressions formula_123 and formula_124 with shared limit zero, the two sequences are asymptotically equivalent if and only if both formula_125 and formula_126 They converge with the same order if and only if formula_126 formula_34 converges with a faster order than formula_129 if and only if formula_130 The convergence of any geometric series to its limit has error terms that are equal to a geometric progression, so similar relationships hold among geometric series as well. Any sequence that is asymptotically equivalent to a convergent geometric sequence may be either be said to &quot;converge geometrically&quot; or &quot;converge exponentially&quot; with respect to the absolute difference from its limit, or it may be said to &quot;converge linearly&quot; relative to a logarithm of the absolute difference such as the &quot;number of decimals of precision.&quot; The latter is standard in numerical analysis.

For any two sequences of elements proportional to an inverse power of formula_131 formula_132 and formula_133 with shared limit zero, the two sequences are asymptotically equivalent if and only if both formula_125 and formula_135 They converge with the same order if and only if formula_135 formula_137 converges with a faster order than formula_138 if and only if formula_139 

For any sequence formula_108 with a limit of zero, its convergence can be compared to the convergence of the shifted sequence formula_141 rescalings of the shifted sequence by a constant formula_117 formula_143 and scaled formula_10-powers of the shifted sequence, formula_145 These comparisons are the basis for the Q-convergence classifications for iterative numerical methods as described above: when a sequence of iterate errors from a numerical method formula_146 is asymptotically equivalent to the shifted, exponentiated, and rescaled sequence of iterate errors formula_147 it is said to converge with order formula_10 and rate formula_149

== Non-asymptotic rates of convergence ==

Non-asymptotic rates of convergence do not have the common, standard definitions that asymptotic rates of convergence have. Among formal techniques, Lyapunov theory is one of the most powerful and widely applied frameworks for characterizing and analyzing non-asymptotic convergence behavior.

For iterative methods, one common practical approach is to discuss these rates in terms of the number of iterates or the computer time required to reach close neighborhoods of a limit from starting points far from the limit. The non-asymptotic rate is then an inverse of that number of iterates or computer time. In practical applications, an iterative method that required fewer steps or less computer time than another to reach target accuracy will be said to have converged faster than the other, even if its asymptotic convergence is slower. These rates will generally be different for different starting points and different error thresholds for defining the neighborhoods. It is most common to discuss summaries of statistical distributions of these single point rates corresponding to distributions of possible starting points, such as the &quot;average non-asymptotic rate,&quot; the &quot;median non-asymptotic rate,&quot; or the &quot;worst-case non-asymptotic rate&quot; for some method applied to some problem with some fixed error threshold. These ensembles of starting points can be chosen according to parameters like initial distance from the eventual limit in order to define quantities like &quot;average non-asymptotic rate of convergence from a given distance.&quot;

For discretized approximation methods, similar approaches can be used with a discretization scale parameter such as an inverse of a number of grid or mesh points or a Fourier series cutoff frequency playing the role of inverse iterate number, though it is not especially common. For any problem, there is a greatest discretization scale parameter compatible with a desired accuracy of approximation, and it may not be as small as required for the asymptotic rate and order of convergence to provide accurate estimates of the error. In practical applications, when one discretization method gives a desired accuracy with a larger discretization scale parameter than another it will often be said to converge faster than the other, even if its eventual asymptotic convergence is slower.

<text>Herschel is a lunar impact crater located just to the north of the walled plain Ptolemaeus. Its diameter is 39 km. It was named after German-born British astronomer William Herschel.

Just to the north is the flooded crater Spörer, and around 30 km due east lies the disintegrated crater Gyldén. About a crater diameter to the northwest (35 km) is the walled plain Flammarion, along the southern edge of the Sinus Medii.

The rim of this crater is generally circular, although the western side is straight. It has a well-defined edge that is not significantly worn, and the inner walls are d. On the rough inner floor is a notable central rise. This peak is offset slightly to the west of the crater midpoint. The small crater Herschel G is attached to the south-southwest rim, and a tiny craterlet lies across the southern rim.

Herschel is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Herschel.

<text>Hippalus is the remnant of a lunar impact crater on the eastern edge of Mare Humorum. It was named after ancient Greek explorer Hippalus. To the southeast is the crater Campanus, and to the northwest is the small flooded crater Loewy.

The southwest rim of Hippalus is missing, and the crater forms a bay along the edge of the mare. The surviving rim is worn and eroded, forming a low, circular mountain range. The lava-flooded floor of Hippalus is bisected by a wide rille belonging to the Rimae Hippalus. This rille follows a course to the south before curving gently to the southwest for a total length of 240 kilometers. The crater floor to the east of this rille is more rugged than the area in the western half.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hippalus.

<doc id="999710" wikidata="Q3124760" url="?curid=999710" title="Salix discolor">
<text>Salix discolor, the American pussy willow or glaucous willow, is a species of willow native to North America, one of two species commonly called pussy willow.

It is native to the vast reaches of Alaska as well as the northern forests and wetlands of Canada (British Columbia east to Newfoundland), and is also found in the northern portions of the contiguous United States (Washington east to Maine, and south to Maryland).

It is a weak-wooded deciduous shrub or small tree growing to tall, with brown shoots. The leaves are oval, 3–14 cm long and 1–3.5 cm broad, green above and downy grey-white beneath.

The flowers are soft silky silvery catkins, borne in early spring before the new leaves appear, with the male and female catkins on different plants (dioecious); the male catkins mature yellow at pollen release.

The fruit is a small capsule 7–12 mm long containing numerous minute seeds embedded in cottony down.

==Cultivation and uses==
Like other willows, it contains salicin, and was used by Native Americans as a painkiller.

As with the closely related &quot;Salix caprea&quot; (European pussy willow), it is also often grown for cut flowers. Pussy willow has further cultural information and other uses.

==Ecology==
Male flowers provide pollen for bees, and it is a popular larval host, supporting the Acadian hairstreak, black-waved flannel moth, cecropia moth, Compton&#x27;s tortoiseshell, cynthia moth, dreamy duskywing, eastern tiger swallowtail, elm sphinx, imperial moth, Io moth, modest sphinx, mourning cloak, polyphemus moth, promethea moth, red-spotted purple, small-eyed sphinx, twin-spotted sphinx, and viceroy.

<text>Hortensius is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Mare Insularum. It was named after 17th century Dutch astronomer Martin van den Hove (Latinized as &quot;Martinus Hortensius&quot;). 
It lies some distance to the west-southwest of the prominent crater Copernicus. Hortensius is circular and cup-shaped, with a small floor at the midpoint of the sloping interior walls. The interior has a higher albedo than the surrounding lunar mare, despite traces of ray material from Copernicus.

To the north of this feature is a collection of six lunar domes, many having a tiny craterlet at the summit. These are shield volcanoes that were formed by a highly viscous type of lava. The domes are generally circular in form, with a diameter of 6–8 kilometers (4–5 mi), and rising as high as 400 meters (1300 ft). They are formed of the same material as the surrounding mare, although from a different process.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hortensius.

<text>Hup is the second album by English alternative rock band the Wonder Stuff, released in 1989.

==Song information==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down, Gently&quot; and &quot;Golden Green&quot; were both released as singles from the album, reaching number 19 and number 33 respectively in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Piece of Sky&quot; was originally planned to be the next single after &quot;Golden Green&quot;, but this plan was abandoned when Rob Jones left the band in December 1989. The promotional video originally filmed for &quot;Piece of Sky&quot; was re-worked (notably with all shots of Rob Jones being removed) and ultimately used for their next single, &quot;Circlesquare&quot;, which was written on the same day as &quot;Can&#x27;t Shape Up&quot;; May 9, 1989.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Shape Up&quot; was originally much slower and played on acoustic guitar with harmonica. One version featured references to Rick Astley. The slower version was released on the &quot;Welcome to the Cheap Seats&quot; EP.

&quot;Unfaithful&quot; is the folksy ballad on the album, and does not feature percussion, only strings and acoustic guitar. &quot;Golden Green&quot; was originally a purely electric guitar and percussion song which had Martin Bell&#x27;s fiddle and banjo added. There was an alternate chorus to &quot;Golden Green&quot; which was not included in the version on &quot;Hup.&quot;

<doc id="999720" wikidata="Q631476" url="?curid=999720" title="Julius Caesar (crater)">
<text>Julius Caesar is a lava-flooded lunar impact crater with a low, irregular, and heavily worn wall. Its diameter is 85 km. It was named after Roman statesman Julius Caesar. It is located to the west of Mare Tranquillitatis, and directly southeast of the crater Manilius on the Mare Vaporum. To the east is the rounded Sosigenes.

The interior floor of Julius Caesar is relatively level, especially in the southwest half. The northern half of the interior has a lower albedo (darker) than the south. Most likely the floor has been covered or modified by ejecta from the impact that created the Imbrium basin. There are a number of crater remnants overlapping the rim along the south and northeast edges. A low ridge crosses the floor across the northeast sections of the crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Julius Caesar.

<text>Construction for the Modern Idiot is the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s fourth album, released in October 1993, and their last studio album before their split on 15 July 1994. The album was a UK Top 5 Album (No. 4) which yielded 3 UK hit singles, of which &quot;On the Ropes (EP)&quot; made the Top 10 (No. 10) and &quot;Hot Love Now&quot; (No. 19) and &quot;Full of Life (Happy Now)&quot; No. 29 both made it inside the Top 30.

The album was dedicated to the memory of Rob &quot;The Bass Thing&quot; Jones, the band&#x27;s original bassist who died from a heart attack in New York soon after leaving the band. It was released as Polydor 519894-2.

==Artwork==
Much of the artwork came from 1960s photographs of a space observation project at Oakmead School in Bournemouth.

The person featured on the album cover is Peter Johnson - Head of Geography at Oakmead School for Boys, Duck Lane Bournemouth later to become its Deputy Head. This invention won for Peter Johnson an FRGS (Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society).

After the album was released the machine was rediscovered in a science storeroom at Oakmead School and started to be used again in science lessons.

<doc id="999726" wikidata="Q6778621" url="?curid=999726" title="Marxist Co-ordination Committee">
<text>The Marxist Co-ordination Committee (MCC, , , abbreviated मासस &#x27;maasas&#x27;) was a political party in Jharkhand, India, based around the coal mining region of Dhanbad. The Party operated from 1971 to 2024.

Marxist Co-ordination Committee since its inception was closely associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation and merged with the party in September 2024. CPI(ML)L held its first meeting after the merger on 10–11 September where five MCC leaders were inducted into its central committee.

Originally founded as &quot;Janwadi Kisan Sangram Samiti&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was formed in 1971 after local communist leader A. K. Roy had been expelled from the Communist Party of India (Marxist). JKSS was later renamed to the MCC. The party was led by Roy, who has been elected MP three times.

Roy was active in the Jharkhand movement and helped develop the organisation which would later become Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. As Jharkhand Mukti Morcha developed into a political party, the relations between the two soured.

In 1980, A. K. Roy (then an MP) and K.S. Chatterjee, a member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, were arrested under the National Security Act. In total, Roy has been jailed four times.

Chatterjee had been elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly twice as an Independent candidate. He joined the Indian National Congress and won in 1985 on a Congress ticket. He is a prominent trade union leader in the Dhanbad region and is the President of Bihar Pradesh Colliery Mazdoor Congress.

In 1998, the only member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly representing the MCC, Gurudas Chatterjee, was murdered by the coal mafia. Chatterjee&#x27;s son, Arup Chatterjee, took over his mandate after a by-poll.

== Members of Lok Sabha ==
== Merge in to CPIML ==

On 9 September 2024, MCC party merge in to CPIML(L) after a rally was organised by the CPIML(L) &amp; Marxist Co-ordination Committee jointly at Dhanbad, Jharkhand.

On 11 September 2024, MCC party General Secretary Comrade Arup Chatterjee selected as new Central Committee member of CPIML(L).

<doc id="999733" wikidata="Q5130098" url="?curid=999733" title="Claymills Pumping Station">
<text>Claymills Pumping Station is a restored Victorian sewage pumping station on the north side of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England DE13 0DA. It was designed by James Mansergh and used to pump sewage to the sewage farm at Egginton.
The main pumping plant consists of four Woolf compound, rotative, beam pumping engines. These are arranged in mirror image pairs, in two separate engine houses, with a central boiler house (containing five Lancashire boilers with economisers) and chimney. The engines were built in 1885 by Gimson and Company of Leicester. All the engines are similar, and the following description is limited to only one, but applicable to all.

The high-pressure cylinder is 24-inch bore by 6-foot stroke, and the low-pressure cylinder is 38-inch bore by 8-foot stroke. Steam is distributed by means of double beat &#x27;Cornish&#x27; valves, mounted in upper and lower valve chests. The cylinders act on one end of the beam, via Watt&#x27;s parallel motion. The beam itself is 26 feet 4 inches between end centres, 4 feet deep at the centre, weighs 13 tons and is carried on bearings.

All four wolf compound Beam engines are now in steam (2023) around 14 weekends a year. The site now boasts a collection of 33 original running steam engines. The Four main pumping engines where all operational till 1969 when A &amp; B engines where halted with C &amp; D engines continuing till 1971. The engines where returned to steam in the following order : D engine (2001) C engine (2002) B engine (2017) and finally A engine (2023). 
The modern sewage works, run by Severn Trent Water, is alongside the pumping station.

==Restoration==
The site was operational until 1971 when following this date the site fell into a state of severe disrepair. The Claymills pumping engines trust gained access to the site in 1993 and have been working to restore the site ever since. the site&#x27;s good condition today is thanks to the commitment and skills of these volunteers.

Following the closure of the site in 1971 the site&#x27;s former chief engineer went to great length to ensure the auxiliary steam plant was saved, dispersing a great number of the smaller steam engines on site to other museums and collections to ensure they were safe. thanks to these efforts the trust has been able to reacquire the vast majority of these engines. 

==Dynamo House==

The pumping station complex has a pair of steam driven dynamo engines, a Buxton &amp; Thornley horizontal engine driving a 1889 Crompton open frame dynamo of 50 amps &amp; a 1906 Claymills made engine driving a smaller closed frame 30 amp dynamo. Both dynamos are 200 volts DC and are both restored to running order.
The main use of these dynamos was the supply of lighting to the site complex and accompanying workers cottages with the larger 50 amp dynamo running at night and the smaller 30 amp unit in the day. These provided all of the site electricity until 1971.
The Claymills made engine driving the 30 amp dynamo is believed to have been manufactured on site in the workshop. It is a piston valve twin cylinder engine and the trust still have the wooden patterns for the cylinder block. 
The Large Buxton and Thornley horizontal steam engine driving the 1889 open frame dynamo has a version of Meyer shut off valve gear.

==Workshop==

The site complex was significantly extended in 1900 when Burton corporation built a fairly sizable workshop on site. This remained the borough workshop until 1971. Following this all of the machinery was removed and disposed of. the vast majority has been required by the trust and the workshop has been restored to full running order.

==Boiler House==
Steam for the pumping engines and auxiliary engines is raised in five Lancashire boilers , with the first set of boilers being made by Robert Stephenson and co. In normal operation only two out of the five boilers would be in steam with one on hot reserve and the other two having maintenance work. The boilers were on an 8 weekly rotation. These boilers were of wrought iron construction and were later renewed in 1936 with steel replacements by John Thomson and co. The changing of the boilers was done one at a time as the plant had to be kept operational during these upgrades. 
The fuel source of these boilers is coal. When the plant was first constructed the boilers were hand fired with the first steam driven mechanical stokers being installed in 1908. A second more reliable generation of mechanical stokers were phased in around 1920, with the boilers being upgraded to the new type of stokers as they dropped out of use. The engine and line shafting from the first set of stokers remained. These mechanical stokers are still in use to this day on the trusts steaming days (2023)
The trust have been experimenting with firing on Biomass.

<doc id="999734" wikidata="Q47592" url="?curid=999734" title="Kepler (lunar crater)">
<text>Kepler is a lunar impact crater that lies between the Oceanus Procellarum to the west and Mare Insularum in the east. To the southeast is the crater Encke. Kepler is named for the 17th century German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler.

== Description ==
Kepler is most notable for the prominent ray system that covers the surrounding mare. The rays extend for well over 300 kilometers, overlapping the rays from other craters. Kepler has a small of ejecta surrounding the exterior of its high rim. The outer wall is not quite circular, and possesses a slightly polygonal form. The interior walls of Kepler are slumped and slightly d, descending to an uneven floor and a minor central rise.

One of the rays from Tycho, when extended across the Oceanus Procellarum, intersects this crater. This was a factor in the choice of the crater&#x27;s name when Giovanni Riccioli was creating his system of lunar nomenclature, as Kepler used the observations of Tycho Brahe while devising his three laws of planetary motion. On Riccioli&#x27;s maps, this crater was named &quot;Keplerus&quot;, and the surrounding skirt of higher albedo terrain was named &quot;Insulara Ventorum&quot;.

Due to its prominent rays, Kepler is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kepler.

<doc id="999743" wikidata="Q16153025" url="?curid=999743" title="International Military Education and Training">
<text>International Military Education and Training (IMET) is the title of a United States security assistance program, a type of student exchange program.

== History ==
Congress established the IMET program in the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (Pub. L. No. 94-329, June 30, 1976), which amended the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (Pub. L. No. 87-195, Sept. 4, 1961). The policies underlying this program are directed by the United States Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and the constituent projects are administered by the United States Department of Defense. The program has trained more than 

In 1990, the United States Congress expanded IMET to include the training of international civilian personnel and courses on responsible defense resource management, respect for democracy and civilian rule of law, civilian control of the military, military judicial systems and military codes of conduct and also added human rights vetting.

In December 2019, the Department of Defense had 5,181 foreign students from 153 countries for security training. 

== Mission ==
The mission of the IMET is to enhance regional stability through mutually beneficial military-to-military relations.

Projects under the program include, but are not limited to, invitations for officers from foreign countries to attend various military schools in the United States, such as the U.S. Army War College or the National Defense University, as well as providing funding for trainers to travel to foreign countries to provide specific, localized training. Topics of instruction are varied and range from English language classes to familiarization training with human rights concepts and the law of war. A complete list of topics varies by year, and may encompass several hundred distinct courses.

The program has supports instruction in Spanish to U.S. and Latin American students at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (previously called U.S. Army School of the Americas), the Inter-American Air Forces Academy and the Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School. 

== Operations ==
=== Afghanistan ===
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States spent approximately $26 million for IMET for Afghan National Security Forces between 2002 and 2020.

=== Egypt ===
In 2016, Egypt was allocated $1.8 million for IMET.

=== Pakistan ===

Pakistan Army officers have been trained through the IMET program since the early 1960s and since the September 11 attacks after the program was briefly being suspended in the 1990s.

In September 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would suspend Pakistan&#x27;s participation in the IMET program to pressure it to crack down on Islamist militants in the region. Pakistan&#x27;s participation was suspended in August 2018. In December 2019, a State Department spokesperson announced that Washington &quot;has approved the resumption of the International Military Education and Training program.&quot; However, the training program has not yet been restored due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan and other reasons.

=== Mali ===
U.S. military officers suspected that the recruitment of Malian Armed Forces officers for IMET was distorted by bribery.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Saudi Arabia&#x27;s participation in IMET was restricted in the aftermath of the 2019 Naval Air Station Pensacola shooting where an officer participant from the Royal Saudi Air Force shot and killed three men.

=== Senegal ===
Senegal has been frequently cited as a country that has immensely benefitted from IMET by using military aid and training received to build a skilled domestic workforce. Former Armed Forces of Senegal military engineers have become contractors, medics and military doctors have become private practitioners, Senegalese Air Force pilots and mechanics join Air Senegal and senior officers schooled in national planning and strategy in the United States and France have been involved in local and national governments.

== Criticism ==
The IMET program has been criticized for failing to sufficiently emphasize military professionalism, civilian control of militaries and the importance of democracy and human rights in its admission processes and curriculum. Training in skills like engineering, transportation, policing and communications has also been criticised for being provided to militaries with a history of human-rights abuses and corruption. Critics have also pointed out that training militaries weakens militaries&#x27; respect for civilian authority instead of improving civil-military relations. IMET has also been criticised for being insufficiently funded to be an effective program.

<text>A  (plural ) was an administrative subdivision created in a number of areas annexed by Nazi Germany between 1938 and 1945.

==Overview==

The term was formed from the words (realm, empire) and , the latter a deliberately medieval-sounding word with a meaning approximately equivalent to &quot;shire&quot;. The were an attempt to resolve the administrative chaos resulting from the mutually overlapping jurisdictions and different boundaries of the NSDAP Party , placed under a Party , and the federal states, under a responsible to the Ministry of the Interior (in the Prussian provinces, the equivalent post was that of ). Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick had long desired to streamline the German administration, and the were the result: the borders of party and those of the federal states were to be identical, and the party also occupied the post of . Rival interests and the influence the wielded with Hitler prevented any reform from being undertaken in the &quot;Old Reich&quot; (), which meant Germany in its borders of 1937 before the annexation of other territories like Austria, the , and Bohemia, and the scheme was therefore implemented only in newly-acquired territories. 

There were several :
* (German: &quot;Ostmark&quot;) formed from the formerly independent Austria
* , formed from a substantial part of the German-speaking outer rim areas of the former Czechoslovakia occupied in 1938
* (German: &quot;Danzig-Westpreußen&quot;) and , formed from the Free City of Danzig and areas annexed from Poland

The East March was subsequently subdivided into seven smaller , generally coterminous with the former Austrian (federal provinces).

==List of ==
=== in Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia established in 1938===
=== established during the Second World War===
===Planned that were never established===
=== Planned for a post-Nazi Germany ===

The conservative wing of the German resistance to Nazism, namely Ludwig Beck and Carl Goerdeler, had planned to divide all of Germany (in the borders of 1938 plus the pre-1918 Prussian lands) after a successful takeover of the government into &quot;Reichsgaue&quot;, modeled after the counties in the UK and the provinces of Prussia. According to Goerdelers 1941 memorandum &quot;Das Ziel&quot; («The Goal»), every &quot;Gau&quot; should have been self-administered by a &quot;Gau Landtag&quot; and overseen by a &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; (similar to a British lord-lieutenant). In every &quot;Gau&quot;, there should have been a &quot;Gau&quot; court (i. e. &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot;), a &quot;Gau&quot; attorney, and a &quot;Gau&quot; president of each the &quot;Reichsbahn&quot;, the &quot;Reichspost&quot;, and the revenue services.

<doc id="999748" wikidata="Q4871158" url="?curid=999748" title="Battle of Guantánamo Bay">
<text>The Battle of Guantánamo Bay was fought from June 6 to June 14 in 1898, during the Spanish–American War, when American and Cuban forces seized the strategically and commercially important harbor of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Capturing the bay from the Spanish forces was instrumental in the following Battle of Santiago de Cuba and the subsequent invasion of Puerto Rico. Although overshadowed by the land and sea battles at Santiago, the establishment of the United States naval base at Guantánamo Bay and the rout of defending Spanish troops by American and Cuban forces was important in the final Spanish defeat.

==Background==
Cuba had been in rebellion against Spain since 1895. Soon after the rebellion began, two insurgent leaders – José Martí and General Máximo Gómez – had landed at the beach of Cajobabo, between Guantánamo Bay and Cape Maisí, but after three years of fighting throughout the island, the rebels had only been successful in two provinces – Oriente and Camagüey.

Following the explosion of the battleship in Havana harbor in February 1898, the U.S. declared war on Spain in support of the Cuban insurgents. Havana harbor was blockaded, and by the end of May the Spanish fleet was bottled up in Santiago Bay, west of Guantánamo Bay, by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. In the U.S., an army expeditionary force was rapidly being readied at the same time for action in Cuba. Thus, America was allied with the Cuban insurgents. Guantánamo Bay had a measure of commercial importance because of the sugar port of Caimanera on the western shore of the inner bay, some five statute miles (8 km) from the sea.

===Spanish positions===
Despite the nominal offensive position of the insurgents in the vicinity of Guantánamo Bay, Spanish regulars and guerrillas held Guantánamo City, the port of Caimanera and the railroad connecting the two cities, the large sugar mills, and other outlying strong points. The Guantánamo garrison consisted of some 5,000 men under the command of General Felix Pareja. A Spanish blockhouse stood on the hill overlooking the village on Fisherman&#x27;s Point near the entrance to the bay, and a fort on Cayo del Toro commanded the relatively narrow channel leading from outer to inner bay. The Spanish gunboat &quot;Sandoval&quot; was based at Caimanera on the inner bay, and a string of blockhouses defended the railroad to Guantánamo City, inland.

The Cuban insurgents maintained coastal outposts from the mouth of the Yateras River, east of the bay, to a point west of Santiago, and were in undisputed possession of the western point at the entrance to the bay.

==Battle==
===Naval battle of Guantánamo Bay===
The first successful U.S. foray against Guantánamo Bay occurred on 6 June, with the arrival of the unprotected cruiser , captained by Commander Bowman H. McCalla, and the auxiliary cruisers and , commanded by Willard H. Brownson. Commander McCalla had been detached by Admiral Sampson from the blockading fleet at Santiago and ordered to reconnoiter the bay for a naval base. The captain of &quot;St. Louis&quot; was to cut the cables which had their terminus in a small station on Fisherman&#x27;s Point, and connected Cuba with Haiti and the outside world.

On a previous occasion, &quot;St. Louis&quot;, on a similar mission, had been driven from the bay by the Spanish gunboat &quot;Sandoval&quot;. This time, as the three warships came into the bay at dawn, Spanish soldiers clustered about the blockhouse on the hill known today as McCalla Hill. The blockhouse and the village were speedily cleared by fire from &quot;Marblehead&quot;″s six-pounder gun, along with a single shell. The Spanish gunboats &quot;Alvarado&quot; and &quot;Sandoval&quot; came down the channel from Caimanera to meet the attack but retired precipitately on discovering the caliber of guns against them. The one cannon of the fort on Cayo del Toro opened fire on &quot;Marblehead&quot; without effect until it was silenced.

The telegraph cables leading east to Cap-Haïtien, west to Santiago, and the small cable in the bay connecting Caimanera and Guantánamo City with Cap-Haïtien were all successfully cut, and from 7 June to 5 July the town of Guantánamo had no communication with the outside world.

Upon returning to the blockading fleet from the reconnaissance, &quot;Marblehead&quot; carried two Cuban officers who had been brought off to the ship from Leeward Point (the western side) of Guantánamo Bay. They had been sent to Admiral Sampson by General Calixto García (the same who figured with U.S. Lieutenant Rowan in the famous &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot;) to report that the Cuban forces, whose outposts occupied positions on the coast from the mouth of the Yateras to a point west of Santiago were at the disposition of the U.S. Commander-in-Chief. Commander McCalla thereafter maintained close liaison with General Pedro Pérez, commanding the Cuban forces around Guantánamo City, through the latter&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Colonel Vieta, and thus received valuable advice and assistance.

===Marine assault landing===

With the decision to establish a base at Guantánamo Bay, the First Battalion of Marines, consisting of six companies of around 650 men (four infantry and one artillery company), was ordered to proceed in the converted transport , and join the fleet off Santiago. The First Battalion, under the command of Lt. Col. Robert W. Huntington USMC, had been undergoing battalion exercises while awaiting orders at Key West. &quot;USS Panther&quot; reached Santiago on 9 June 1898. That same day, in advance of the battalion landing, Navy Commander Bowman H. McCalla of the , the officer in command of the landings, approved a camp site selected for the Marines by Lt. Col. Huntington. The site selected was a flat ridge on top of a hill, above the village on Fisherman&#x27;s Point, and designated Camp McCalla. In addition to an artillery company equipped with a battery of four 3-inch rapid-firing artillery pieces and two Model 1895 Colt–Browning machine guns, each marine was equipped with the Navy&#x27;s new rapid-firing magazine rifle, the Model 1895 Lee Navy. Both the Colt machine gun and the Lee rifles used a new high-velocity smokeless powder cartridge, the 6 mm Lee Navy.

The Marine battalion landed unopposed on 10 June with four of its six companies, leaving A company and F company (the artillery company) aboard to unload the ship, as Commander Reiter, the captain of the &quot;Panther&quot;, had refused to authorize the use of ship&#x27;s personnel for unloading duties. Reiter also refused to permit the unloading of the remainder of the Marines&#x27; small arms ammunition, claiming that it was needed as ship&#x27;s ballast. Lt. Col. Huntington sought assistance from Commander McCalla, who ordered Reiter to release the Marines&#x27; ammunition at once: &quot;Sir, break out immediately and land with the crew of &quot;Panther&quot;, 50,000 rounds of 6-mm. ammunition,&quot; McCalla ordered. &quot;In the future, do not require Colonel Huntington to break out or land his stores with members of his command. Use your own officers and men for this purpose, and supply the Commanding Officer of Marines promptly with anything he may desire.&quot;

The Marines burned crude huts of the village and the remains of the blockhouse with all their contents to avoid the possibility of yellow fever. The Spanish had fled in such a hurry that clothing, money, jewelry and weapons had been left behind. The battalion raised the American flag, the first U.S. military unit to do so on Cuban soil, and sent out detachments for outpost duty.

Lt. Col. Huntington ordered Company C to occupy a 150-ft tall hill located some distance from the main Marine position, and which could not be supported by the main body at Camp McCalla. Two forward outposts were established, one at a road junction located several hundred yards ahead of the camp and known as the &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and one called &quot;The Bridge&quot; placed across a road a mile and a half from the American camp, where Spanish forces bringing artillery from Caimanera were expected. With the sea at their backs, a lack of mutual support between outposts, and the thorny scrub and cacti of the arid hills stretching in a dense tangle before them, the Marines had a less-than-ideal tactical position. Commander McCalla pointed out to Lt. Col. Huntington that his outposts were too far forward and could not be seen or supported in the dense undergrowth between the outposts and the main camp. Three of the companies stacked arms and returned to the ship to help with unloading operations. Shortly after sundown, the Marines had their first meal of coffee and hardtack. Soon afterwards the first alarm came. Voices were heard and lights seen in the thicket, but no attack came that night. Spanish forces defending the area were desperately short of food, and delayed attacking until the Marines had completed unloading their stores in hopes of seizing the American supplies.

By daybreak, the Marines had completed unloading their stores and equipment, though the artillery pieces and their ammunition were left aboard ship. The remaining companies of the battalion came ashore, and Company C was withdrawn from its isolated hill outpost. The only sound in the thickets was the cooing of mourning doves, a sound which Marines would later learn was a favorite signal call used by Spanish loyalist guerrilla forces.

Lt. Col. Huntington was joined in the afternoon by Colonel Laborde of the Cuban army, who for several days had been with Commander McCalla as pilot on &quot;Marblehead&quot;, and now had been sent ashore to assist the Marines and provide intelligence about the enemy.

Laborde reported the major Spanish force in the area had its headquarters at the &quot;Well of Cuzco&quot;, southeast of Fisherman&#x27;s Point. The well provided the only fresh water in the area. This occupying force of about 500 soldiers and guerrillas, joined by the troops driven from the blockhouse on the bay, constituted the gravest threat to the U.S. base of operations. Laborde noted that seizing Cuzco Well and destroying it would inevitably force Spanish forces to retreat all the way to Ciudad Guantánamo (Guantánamo City).

As they spoke, firing began in the thicket in front of their position. Lt. Col. Huntington led most of his command forward. However, the thorny tangle of trees, underbrush, and cactus forced him to proceed with only one company.

===Battle of Camp McCalla===

Although Huntington was now assured of naval gunfire support, Camp McCalla was tactically unsound. No attack had been expected, so no trenches were dug. The Marines&#x27; artillery had not even been sent ashore. Located on the sands of the open beach, the Marine campsite proved an ideal target for snipers concealed in the brush.

At daybreak (05:00) on Saturday, 11 June, Spanish guerrillas opened fire on the Marines at Camp McCalla from the surrounding brush. Firing a fusillade from their rapid-firing Mauser rifles, the guerrillas advanced towards the camp. After heavy fighting, and supported by the reserve company (Company C) the Marines drove the enemy back into the bush, pursuing the enemy until the chase was abandoned at dark. Two pickets on outpost duty, Privates William Dumphy and James McColgan, who were posted as an early-warning patrol 100 yards ahead of the &quot;Crossroads&quot; forward outpost were later found dead, shot and cut numerous times in the face and body. Their weapons, shoes, belts, and part of their clothing had been taken.

This was the beginning of what Huntington&#x27;s executive officer, Major Henry Clay Cochrane, later called &quot;its 100 hours of fighting&quot;. At Camp McCalla, the Marines dug in and began firing at the concealed Spaniards, aided by three 3-inch field pieces and two additional 6 mm Colt–Browning machine guns which had been landed on 12 June by the . Gunfire from &quot;Marblehead&quot; passed overhead and impacted in the nearby hills. Wearing large palm leaves tied to their uniforms for camouflage, and firing smokeless powder cartridges, the Spanish forces were difficult to locate as they moved from bush to bush in the dense undergrowth.

On the evening of 12 June, enemy forces came within fifty yards of Camp McCalla, and a desperate firefight began. Marines responded with their Lee straight-pull rifles, along with machine gun and artillery fire from the Marine 3-inch field pieces. Perhaps deterred by the intense artillery and machine gun fire, the Spanish did not attempt to overrun the camp. Acting Assistant Surgeon John Blair Gibbs and Sergeant Charles H. Smith were both killed in this exchange of fire. Marines later found several blood trails, but no bodies, as the guerrillas removed their wounded and dead to conceal their casualty figures.

The next day, the Marines were reinforced by about 60 Cubans under Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Thomas. The Cubans had been equipped with rifles and white duck sailor uniforms by Commander McCalla from the USS &quot;Marblehead&quot;. Familiar with guerrilla tactics, the Cuban insurgents deployed in pairs in front of the camp, burning the brush and undergrowth as they advanced, thus denying to the enemy of cover. The &quot;Marblehead&quot;, which had provided shore bombardment on several occasions, steamed down the coast and shelled the well at Cuzco. Nevertheless, the Spanish attack was resumed at dusk, and two more Marines—acting Sergeant Major Henry Good and Private Goode Taurman—were killed.

By nightfall on 13 June, the Marines were exhausted. They had not slept nor rested for 100 hours. Relief or reinforcements was impossible, since U.S. Army troops had yet to leave the U.S. The fighting continued for two more days.

===Battle of Cuzco Well===
Lt Col. Thomas of the Cuban rebel forces advised Colonel Huntington to attack the Spanish garrison at Cuzco Well, consisting of four companies of Spanish infantry and two companies of loyalist guerrilla forces totaling some 500 men. By capturing and destroying the only nearby source of fresh water, it was hoped that the defending Spanish forces would be forced to leave the area. Commander McCalla approved the plans, and the attack was scheduled for 08:00 the next day.

Marine companies C and D, about 160 men, under Captain George F. Elliott, a future Commandant of the Marine Corps, joined by the fifty Cubans under Lt. Col. Thomas, would approach Cuzco along the cliffs by the sea. A smaller Marine force would advance by an inland valley, holding a picket line for the main force, with men in reserve to assist if necessary. The gunboat was assigned to support the attack from sea.

The day was already hot when the combined U.S.-Cuban force began its march on 14 June. Colonel Laborde guided the main force, and a Cuban scout named Polycarpio guided a smaller force led by 2nd Lt. Magill. The march was slowed by rough terrain, vicious undergrowth, and increasing heat; at one point, the captains of Companies C and D in the main column had fallen behind owing to heat exhaustion. It was almost 11:00 when the main force reached the steep, horseshoe-shaped hill around Cuzco valley; the commanders of Companies C and D rejoined their units fifteen minutes later.

About the same time, the Cubans, who were marching ahead of the Marine companies, were spotted by the enemy. A race for the crest of the hill began. The Marines and the Cubans reached the summit first, under heavy fire from the Spanish and guerrillas. The smaller Marine force approached on the double, using their 6 mm (0.236-inch) Lee rifles to pour a deadly crossfire on the enemy flank. Three of the four M1895 Colt–Browning machine guns accompanying the Marines were used by Company C in the fighting. According to Pvt. John Clifford of Company D, the machine guns were instrumental in supporting the Marine assault. This was the first known tactical use of machine gun fire for mobile fire support in offensive combat.

The light weight of the Marines&#x27; new 6mm Lee cartridge proved to be of considerable benefit, allowing each Marine and machine gun crew to transport large amounts of ammunition over the mountainous, jungled terrain. Midway through the battle, the Cuban rebel forces ran out of 6 mm cartridges, and were resupplied with an additional six clips (30 cartridges) from the belts of individual Marines, yet none of the Americans ran short of ammunition, despite firing some sixty shots apiece in the battle.

During this portion of the fighting, Captain Elliott had requested that &quot;Dolphin&quot; provide fire support to the Marines by shelling the Spanish blockhouse and nearby positions with her naval guns. Through a miscommunication of signals, however, the gunboat began unknowingly dropping shells in the direct path of a small force of fifty marines and ten Cuban irregulars led by 2nd Lt. Magill, who was attempting to flank the Spanish position and potentially cut off any avenue of retreat. Affixing his handkerchief to a long stick and braving the Spanish fire, Sergeant John H. Quick took up an exposed position on the ridge to immediately wigwag a flag signal to &quot;Dolphin&quot; to adjust her gunfire. War Correspondent Stephen Crane, who had accompanied the Marines, later described the scene in his war tale &quot;Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo&quot;:

&quot;Sergeant Quick arose, and announced that he was a signalman. He produced from somewhere a blue polka-dot neckerchief as large as a quilt. He tied it on a long, crooked stick. Then he went to the top of the ridge, and turning his back to the Spanish fire, began to signal to the &quot;Dolphin&quot;. Again we gave a man sole possession of a particular part of the ridge. We didn&#x27;t want it. He could have it and welcome. If the young sergeant had had the smallpox, the cholera, and the yellow fever, we could not have slid out with more celerity.

As men have said often, it seemed as if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope that he would not be hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.

I watched his face, and it was as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very embodiment of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.

To say the least, a fight at close range is absorbing as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.

I saw Quick betray only one sign of emotion. As he swung his clumsy flag to and fro, an end of it once caught on a cactus pillar, and he looked sharply over his shoulder to see what had it. He gave the flag an impatient jerk. He looked annoyed.&quot;

When Sergeant Quick finished this message, the ship answered. Quick then picked up his Lee rifle and resumed his place on the firing line. For his gallant and selfless conduct during this action, Quick would later receive the Medal of Honor.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; shifted her fire onto the enemy camp and blockhouse, and by 14:00, the Spanish had broken and fled the blockhouse. Unfortunately, 2nd Lt. Magill&#x27;s men were delayed sufficiently to prevent them from cutting off a Spanish retreat, though his men did capture the Spanish signaling station and its heliograph equipment. As the Spanish forces withdrew through a gully on the other side of the valley, Marines opened fire at a distance of 1,200 yards, firing volley after volley. The Spanish were unable to accurately return fire, allowing Marine Company B and the Cuban rebels to close the distance, firing as they advanced. The Spanish first attempted to concentrate their fires on the Cubans and managed to kill two of them, but were forced back by Marine rifle fire once again, at which point the remaining enemy, which up to that point had been withdrawing in good order, broke and scattered.

===Spanish retreat===
By 15:30, the enemy had abandoned the battlefield, and all firing had ceased. Most of the Spanish had escaped, but a lieutenant and 17 enlisted men were captured, and the enemy suffered casualties of 60 killed and 150 wounded. They had left behind 30 modern 7mm Mauser rifles and ammunition. Two Marines and two Cuban rebels had been wounded, and two Cuban rebels killed, who were buried where they fell. The most serious casualties suffered by the Marines were from heat exhaustion, which disabled one officer and 22 men. Gunboat &quot;Dolphin&quot; took these aboard after the fighting was over for the trip back to Camp McCalla. The Spanish headquarters building (blockhouse) was burned, and the freshwater well at Cuzco was destroyed, thus ending its immediate usefulness, including to the Marines, whose officers would not let them drink from it prior to its destruction. Water was eventually brought up from the USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; after a wait of two hours.

Spanish forces retreated in small groups of stragglers to Guantánamo, via Cayo del Toro and Caimanera. Apparently expecting the U.S. forces to follow up the victory, they fortified Dos Caminos, a small settlement at the crossing of two roads, and added several blockhouses to the number already erected on the rail line. The Spanish soldiers were apparently impressed by Marine firepower; upon arrival at Ciudad Guantánamo (Guantánamo City), the surviving members of the Cuzco Well garrison informed General Pareja that they had been attacked by 10,000 Americans.

Camp McCalla saw no further attacks by Spanish or guerilla forces, and was disestablished on August 5, 1898.

Meanwhile, attention was soon focused on other areas of the bay. The Spanish were adding to their earthworks on Cayo del Toro, where they had three bronze guns and a modern Krupp gun. At Caimanera, on the bluff south of the village, were mounted three more of the guns, and the small gunboat &quot;Sandoval&quot; had a battery of one six-pounder and an automatic one-pounder Maxim gun.

==Aftermath==
===Bombardment of Fort Toro===
Admiral Sampson decided to shell the fort of Cayo del Toro, and on 16 June he sent USS &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;Yankee&quot; to join with USS &quot;Marblehead&quot; in this plan. Fire from the three ships temporarily dismounted two of the enemy&#x27;s big guns, destroyed the buildings on the Cay, and drove the troops from all guns and trenches. Their combined firepower had reduced the Spanish fort to impotency within 15 minutes of initially engaging it. One enemy shell landed near the bow of the Marblehead, sinking within ten yards of the ship, but no hits were scored.

As the Americans proceeded slowly, a lookout on &quot;Marblehead&quot; reported that the starboard propeller was foul of a buoy. The engine was stopped, and the propeller was cleared of the &quot;buoy&quot;, which turned out to be a contact mine. The mine was successfully disarmed. Afterward, it was learned that the ships had passed through a field of 18 such mines, or torpedoes, on the trip up the bay and through the same field on the return trip, without injury of any kind. A few days after the attack on Cayo del Toro, the mine field was thoroughly explored, and 14 mines were recovered. Their failure to explode on contact was attributed to mechanical faults, plus a healthy growth of barnacles on the contact levers.

The minesweeping operation, carried out without specialized equipment, involved two steam launches and two whaleboats from &quot;Marblehead&quot; and &quot;Dolphin&quot;. A launch and whaleboat side by side, connected to the other launch and whaleboat by a rope with a chain drag in the center, swept the channel. When the drag met an obstruction, the boats came together and crossed the ends of the drag. The boats were then hauled carefully up to the mine, which was brought to the surface and disarmed. Twice the drag brought up two mines together.

While sweeping for mines, the boats had been fired on from Hicacal Beach, where 250 Spanish infantry were posted to guard the mine field. It was determined to rout the last enemy force remaining in the vicinity of the bay, and on 25 June Lt. Col. Huntington led two companies of Marines and 40 Cubans in an amphibious assault on Hicacal Beach. It proved to be a bloodless encounter, since the Spanish had left a day or two earlier.

===Santiago===
With &quot;Guantánamo&quot; Bay successfully occupied, US interest centered on operations at Santiago. An American expeditionary force of 17,000 officers and men under Major General William R. Shafter was landed east of the city at the small ports of Daiquirí and Siboney between 22 and 25 June, without opposition. A week later, on 1 July, the historic battles of El Caney and San Juan Hill ended in victory for U.S. forces, opening up the approaches to Santiago itself. On the morning of 3 July, a demand was sent to the Spanish commander, General Arsenio Linares, to surrender or suffer bombardment of the city as an alternative. On the same morning, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera sallied forth from Santiago Bay, only to meet with complete destruction at the hands of the U.S. fleet. Major Spanish resistance at Santiago was at an end, although it was not until 15 July that a preliminary agreement was signed. U.S. forces occupied the city on 17 July.

The 7,000 Spanish troops at the city of Guantánamo – only away – did not march to the aid of Linares&#x27; besieged army, because prior to the cutting of his communications, General Pareja had been directed by his superiors to hold the city of Guantánamo at all costs. This was so ordered because the Spanish feared that the Guantánamo valley might be used as an invasion route by U.S. forces, as the English had once used it to advance on Santiago. After the Navy cut the cables and established a base at Guantánamo Bay, General Pareja remained in complete ignorance concerning the course of the war because the Cuban insurgents maintained such a tight ring about the city that not one messenger got through their lines. Fifteen were caught and executed as spies. None of General Linares&#x27; frantic requests for aid reached Pareja.

The threat posed by U.S. Naval forces and a battalion of Marines at Guantánamo Bay, plus the stranglehold on land communications by 1,000 Cuban insurgents, effectively pinned down an army of 7,000 men which might have changed the outcome of the fighting at Santiago. Less than a week after the surrender of Santiago, the base at Guantánamo Bay was used to launch the invasion of Puerto Rico, to the east. Three thousand five hundred troops under General Miles sailed from the Bay on 21 July. This was the last important event in the Spanish–American War phase of Guantánamo Bay; on August 12, the war ended with the signing of the peace protocol and an armistice.
The new U.S. Naval Base was not formalized by lease agreement between the U.S. and Cuba until five years later, when in 1903 it was acquired as a &quot;coaling and Naval station&quot;, but its worth was already proven.

Lt. Col. Huntington&#x27;s Marine First Battalion, which had reembarked aboard the during the siege and surrender of Santiago, sailed for the United States, and after a stop at New York, arrived at Portsmouth Harbor, disembarking her marines on the evening of 24 August 1898.

<doc id="999749" wikidata="Q4741685" url="?curid=999749" title="Amboy Crater">
<text>Amboy Crater is a dormant cinder cone volcano that rises above a lava field in the eastern Mojave Desert of southern California, within Mojave Trails National Monument.

It is about equidistant from Barstow to the west and Needles to the east, and south of historic U.S. Route 66, near the town of Amboy in San Bernardino County. In 1973, Amboy Crater was designated the Amboy Crater National Natural Landmark.
==Location==
The crater&#x27;s location is southwest of the town of Amboy and the Route 66-National Trails Highway. The Bullion Mountains are to the west, and the Bristol Mountains to the northeast.

==Description==

This cinder cone is estimated to be 79,000 years old (+/- 5,000 years) and was formed in layers of mostly vesicular pahoehoe during the Pleistocene geological period. The interior has a solidified lava lake. Lava flows as old as Amboy Crater itself blanket the surrounding area. The most recent eruption was approximately 10,000 years ago.

The crater is above sea level, about above the surrounding basalt lava plains. The scenic and solitary Amboy Crater was a popular sight and stop for travelers on U.S. Route 66 in California before the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973. Other than a stretch of U.S. Route 66 in New Mexico, Amboy Crater is one of just a few extinct volcanoes along the entire route, so generations of U.S. Route 66 travelers from the 1920s through the 1960s could boast that they had climbed a real volcano. Visits decreased after Interstate 40 opened, but have increased in recent years with the nearby Mitchell Caverns, Mojave National Preserve, and renewed historical tourism interest in &quot;old Route 66&quot;.

==Visiting==

The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recommends using the Western Cone Trail to reach the volcano peak&#x27;s rim, a steep and rocky hiking trail. The trailhead is at the Amboy Crater day-use parking area, which provides shaded and open picnic tables and public restrooms. Regular desert precautions apply here: being alert for rattlesnakes and old military explosives, and having a hat, sunscreen, sturdy shoes and abundant drinking water. Educational and organized groups are advised to contact the BLM before going to Amboy Crater.

==Media==
Amboy Crater was used as a location in the 1959 movie &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, with matte paintings used to alter the shape of the cone and place it within the landscape of Iceland. Fires were set inside the crater to simulate a volcanic eruption. Amboy Crater was also featured in the Viceland network show &quot;Abandoned&quot;, Season 1, episode 6: &quot;Route 66&quot;. In HBO&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; Apollo 15 episode, Amboy Crater is overflown during astronaut training as a stand-in for the terrain of the San Francisco Volcanic Field outside of Flagstaff, AZ.

<doc id="999751" wikidata="Q630636" url="?curid=999751" title="La Caille (crater)">
<text>La Caille is a lunar impact crater located in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It was named after the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. It is located to the northeast of the crater Purbach. Nearly attached to the southeast rim are the remains of Blanchinus, and the two are separated by a rugged stretch of terrain. To the northeast is Delaunay, a formation split in half by a ridge.

The floor of La Caille has been flooded in the past by lava, and the surface is relatively smooth and flat with no central rise. Only a few tiny craterlets along the north and northwest edges disrupt the surface. Ray material lies across the central and southern parts of the floor, most likely from Tycho to the southwest.

The rim of this crater is heavily worn and battered, with notches around the interior edge and craters across the top and along the exterior. The most notable of these is La Caille B which lies across the eastern rim.

For a few hours before the first quarter, the crater&#x27;s rim contributes to the Lunar X visual phenomenon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to La Caille.

<text>Lithocarpus is a genus in the beech family, Fagaceae. Trees in this genus are commonly known as the stone oaks and differ from &quot;Quercus&quot; primarily because they produce insect-pollinated flowers on erect spikes and the female flowers have short styles with punctate stigmas. At current, around 340 species have been described, mostly restricted to Southeast Asia. Fossils show that &quot;Lithocarpus&quot; formerly had a wider distribution, being found in North America and Europe during the Eocene to Miocene epochs. The species extend from the foothills of the Hengduan Mountains, where they form dominant stands of trees, through Indochina and the Malayan Archipelago, crossing Wallace&#x27;s Line and reaching Papua. In general, these trees are most dominant in the uplands (more than above sea level) and have many ecological similarities to the Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant lowland tree group. These trees are intolerant of seasonal droughts, not being found on the Lesser Sunda Islands, despite their ability to cross numerous water barriers to reach Papua.

The North American [[tanoak]] or tanbark oak (&quot;Notholithocarpus densiflorus&quot;) was previously included in this genus but recent evidence indicates the similarities in flower and fruit morphology are due to convergent evolution. Both genetic and morphological evidence demonstrate that the tanoak is a distant relative to Asian stone oaks, and therefore tanoak has been moved into a new genus, &quot;Notholithocarpus&quot;.

&quot;Lithocarpus&quot; trees are evergreen trees with leathery, alternate leaves, the margins of which are almost always entire, rarely toothed. The seed is a nut similar to an oak acorn with a cupule enclosing the basal part of the fruit. Cupules of stone oaks demonstrate a wide variety in the type and arrangement of lamellae and scales on the outside of the cupule, with some of them completely enclosing the nut, even becoming irregularly dehiscent in a few species. The seeds are often protected by a hard woody shell (hence the genus name, from Greek , , &quot;stone&quot; and , , &quot;seed&quot;). In some sections of the genus, the seed is embedded in the basal material of the fruit which becomes highly lignified and hard, lending greater mechanical protection to the seed, creating a novel type of fruit. The kernel is edible in some species (e.g. &quot;Lithocarpus edulis&quot;), but inedible, and very bitter, in others.

Several of the species are very attractive ornamental trees, used in parks and large gardens in warm temperate and subtropical areas.

==Classification==
In 1948, Aimee Camus produced a comprehensive treatment of the two major genera in the family, given the specimens available to her at the Natural History Museum in Paris. Because of the many collections available from the French colonies in subtropical and tropical Indochina, she worked extensively with stone oaks from the region. Most importantly, she provided the only existing infrageneric structure within the genus but unfortunately, many of the species from the Malesian region, south of the Isthmus of Kra, are not incorporated into this system.

Her classification system included 13 subgenera, including the subgenus &quot;Pasania&quot; which is by far the largest division within the genus. About 100 Asian species were treated separately in &quot;Pasania&quot;, at the genus level, and occasionally the old name persists on some herbarium sheets that have not been annotated. Several of the other subgenera possess fewer than ten species and have distinctive morphologies. Few of the Malesian species are treated in Camus&#x27; system and Soepadmo, who wrote the Flora Malesiana treatment, made no attempt to update or integrate these species into Camus&#x27; system, therefore a lot of work obviously remains to be done. Camus&#x27; system was highly detailed, as three levels of organization are recognized below the subgenus, but the classification is not systematic at the lowest level.

List of subgenera (No. of species in Camus&#x27; treatment): &quot;Castanicarpus&quot; (1); &quot;Corylopasania&quot; (2); &quot;Cryptostylis&quot; (1); &quot;Cyclobalanus&quot; (58); &quot;Cyrtobalanus&quot; (1); &quot;Eulithocarpus&quot; (11); &quot;Gymnobalanus&quot; (10); &quot;Liebmannia&quot; (3); &quot;Oerstedia&quot; (1); &quot;Pachybalanus&quot; (14); &quot;Pasania&quot; (209); &quot;Pseudosynaedrys&quot; (9); &quot;Synaedrys&quot; (15); indeterminate (12).

Early researchers into the family often suggested that the stone oaks were primitive in the family. An exhaustive study of the inflorescence and fruits of 73 species from eight of Camus&#x27; subgenera found that important development and evolutionary characters distinguish the major groups in the genus and indicate differences among the genera of the family.

<text>The Cuban cactus scrub is a xeric shrubland ecoregion that occupies on the leeward coast of Cuba. Most of it occurs in the southeastern part of the island in the provinces of Guantánamo and Santiago de Cuba. The ecoregion receives less than of rainfall annually. The principal soils are coastal rendzinas that were derived from coralline limestone. Cuban cactus scrub contains four vegetation zones: xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland, coastal thorny semidesert, coastal sclerophyllous scrubland, and rocky coastal scrublands.

==Xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland==
Vegetation in the xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrublands reaches a height of and is dominated by palms and succulents, especially cacti. Common evergreen plants include (&quot;Bourreria virgata&quot;), (&quot;Capparis cynophallophora&quot;), (&quot;Eugenia foetida&quot;), &quot;Bursera glauca&quot;, &quot;B. cubana&quot;, &quot;Croton&quot; spp., &quot;Cordia&quot; spp., &quot;Calliandra colletioides&quot;, &quot;Caesalpinia&quot; spp., &quot;Acacia&quot; spp., &quot;Phyllostylon brasiliense&quot;, &quot;Pseudosamanea cubana&quot; and (&quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot;). (&quot;Opuntia stricta&quot;), &quot;O. militaris&quot;, (&quot;Harrisia eriophora&quot;), (&quot;H. taetra&quot;), (&quot;Pilosocereus polygonus&quot;), (&quot;Dendrocereus nudiflorus&quot;), (&quot;Agave&quot; spp.), (&quot;Melocactus&quot; spp.) and &quot;Leptocereus&quot; spp. are typical succulents.

==Coastal thorny semidesert==
Coastal thorny semidesert is similar to xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland in that they both have the same succulent composition and reach a height of . However, succulents represent a smaller proportion of the plant life in this zone. Other plant species include (&quot;Cordia sebestena&quot;), (&quot;Hippomane mancinella&quot;) and (&quot;Plumeria filifolia&quot;).

==Coastal sclerophyllous scrubland==
The vegetation in this zone is sclerophyllous, meaning that their leaves are hard. It reaches a height of with emergent trees up to . This zone represents the transition between xeric shrublands and moister dry forests. Plant life includes (&quot;Picrodendron baccatum&quot;), (&quot;Maytenus buxifolia&quot;), (&quot;Pictetia spinosa&quot;), (&quot;Brya ebenus&quot;) and (&quot;Diospyros grisebachii&quot;).

==Rocky coastal scrublands==
The most sparse and stunted vegetation is found in this zone, which occurs adjacent to the ocean on karstic soil. The flora is tolerant of wind and salt spray, and includes (&quot;Borrichia arborescens&quot;), (&quot;Tournefortia gnaphalodes&quot;), and (&quot;Sesuvium maritimum&quot;).

==Fauna==
Birds of the cactus scrub include the Zapata sparrow (&quot;Torreornis inexpectata sigmani&quot;), Cuban vireo (&quot;Vireo gundlachii&quot;), Cuban gnatcatcher (&quot;Polioptila lembeyei&quot;), and Oriente warbler (&quot;Teretistris fornsi&quot;). The yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (&quot;Eleutherodactylus limbatus&quot;) is a species of frog endemic to this ecoregion, while several anole species and the Cuban rock iguana (&quot;Cyclura nubila nubila&quot;) are endemic lizards.

<text>Lalande is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the central part of the visible Moon, on the eastern edge of Mare Insularum. It was named after French astronomer Jérôme Lalande. The crater is surrounded by a high-albedo area of ejecta that extends into a ray system with a maximum radius of over 300 kilometers. The interior wall has a system, and there is a small central rise at the midpoint of the floor. It was formed during the Copernican period of the moon extending from 1.1 billion years ago to the present. Its young age is indicated by the bright rays of ejecta surrounding the crater, its sharp features, and the relative lack of later impacts in its interior. The rays of ejecta from Lalande overlay the ejecta rays from Copernicus Crater, meaning it is younger than Copernicus, and thus no more than 800 million years old.

In 2002, a meteorite was discovered in the Oman desert by Edwin Gnos of the University of Berne. This rock, identified as Sayh al Uhaymir 169, is believed to have originated from the Moon. It was ejected from the surface during an impact that occurred less than 340,000 years in the past. Scientists now think that the rock originated from the crater ejecta blanket surrounding Lalande.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lalande.

<doc id="999764" wikidata="Q624662" url="?curid=999764" title="Lambert (lunar crater)">
<text>Lambert is a lunar impact crater on the southern half of the Mare Imbrium basin. It was named after Swiss polymath Johann Heinrich Lambert. It lies to the east and somewhat south of the slightly larger crater Timocharis. To the south is the smaller Pytheas, and some distance to the west-southwest is Euler.

The crater is relatively easy to locate due to its isolated position on the mare. It has an outer , d inner walls, and a rough interior that has a comparable albedo to its surroundings. Instead of a central peak, a small craterler lies at the midpoint of the interior.

Just to the south of Lambert&#x27;s ramparts is the lava-covered rim of Lambert R, a crater that is almost completely covered by the mare. The diameter of this ghost crater is larger than Lambert, but it is difficult to spot except when the Sun is at a very low angle, casting long shadows.

Lambert is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lambert.

<text>.bo is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bolivia. BO is the ISO 3166-1 code for Bolivia.

== Management ==
It is administered by ADSIB. As of February 2011, the NIC was offering a registration fee of about US$40 per year or 280 $Bs for third-level domain and US$140 per year or 980 $Bs for second level domain.
Registration is at the second or third level.

Brazilian TV Globo has also used this domain for shortener with the glo.bo URL.

<doc id="999770" wikidata="Q5200873" url="?curid=999770" title="Cyril Sidlow">
<text>Cyril Sidlow (26 November 1915 – 12 April 2005) was a Welsh football goalkeeper. He played for several football clubs, most notably Wolverhampton Wanderers (commonly referred to as Wolves) and Liverpool.

== Life and playing career ==
Sidlow was born in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, North Wales. He played for Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Major Frank Buckley signed Sidlow to the Wolves in 1937. Sidlow was the first choice Wolves keeper before World War II, but the signing of Bert Williams after the war limited his chances. His career included a notable international match between England and Wales at Ninian Park where the Wolves supplied both the England keeper (Williams) and Welsh keeper (Sidlow). 

Wolves had two international goalkeepers, which led to Sidlow being surplus to requirements. In February 1946, Liverpool manager George Kay signed him for a then-record £4,000. Sidlow made his debut for Liverpool on 31 August 1946 in a league match at Bramall Lane and kept his first clean sheet for the club, with Len Carney scoring a late goal for the Reds in the 90th minute.

At 24, Sidlow&#x27;s career was curtailed with the beginning of the World War II. He was almost 31 when he re-signed for the Reds. Sidlow, with Charlie Ashcroft and Ray Minshull, were the goalkeepers vying for the number one jersey at Anfield for the 1946/47 season: the first competitive season following the war. Even with the competition, Sidlow was given the position, which he held for 34 of the 42 games in a season that saw Liverpool win their first championship in 24 years. Much of this win is owed to Sidlow as the final game of the season was a must-win for the Reds. Sidlow&#x27;s former employers, the Wolves, needed just a point to win the title and Liverpool had to face them at Molineux. The Reds were a point back on their hosts and needed a victory to win the league title. After a comprehensive 5–0 win at Anfield, the Wolves were favorites to win the game and take the title. But goals from Jack Balmer and Albert Stubbins — plus Sidlow and the backline keeping Wolves down to one goal — meant the Championship trophy would be heading to Merseyside. His performance in this pivotal game against his former club is often considered the high point of Sidlow&#x27;s Liverpool career.

Sidlow tasted disappointment with the Reds too when they reached their first Wembley final in 1950. Arsenal, the opposition, took the FA Cup back to Highbury after a 2–0 win. Sidlow&#x27;s Liverpool days were drawn to a close during the 1950/51 after he originally begun the season as first choice. Charlie Ahcroft and Russell Crossley took over for four games before Sidlow came back in to play his last match for the club. Anfield was the place and Newcastle United were the visitors. Things didn&#x27;t go well for Sidlow and the Reds as The Magpies went back to St James&#x27; Park with the points after a 4–2 win. Crossley came back into the side, and Sidlow retired in the August 1952. Upon retirement from the top level, he went on to play for New Brighton.

Sidlow earned seven caps playing for Wales during his career.

== Memorial ==
Sidlow died at 89 in 2005. After his death, his daughter sponsored a local award in Perton and Codsall, where her father lived until his death, to recognize local players&#x27; achievements.

=== Liverpool ===
*Football League Championship (level 1) winners medal (1947)

<text>.br is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Brazil. It was administered by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee until 2005 when it started being administered by Brazilian Network Information Center. A local contact is required for any registration. Registrations of domain names with Portuguese characters are also accepted.

With the exception of universities, the second-level domain is fixed and selected from a list that defines the category. For example, is in the art (music, folklore &quot;etc.&quot;) category, and is in the non-governmental organization category. Institutions of tertiary education were allowed to use the ccSLD , although some use and others (mainly public universities) use . There are also some other few exceptions that were allowed to use the second level domain until the end of 2000. As of April 2010, most domain registrations ignore categories and register in the domain, which has over 90% of all registered domains. The (Judiciary), and (banks) domains have mandatory DNSSEC use.

== History ==
Created and delegated to Brazil in 1989 by Jon Postel, initially the domain was operated manually by Registro.br and administered by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP). Originally, only researchers and institutions to which they belonged had the interest and ability to adopt the new system and register domains under .br.

At the time, networks prevalent in the Brazilian academic setting were the BITNET (&quot;Because It&#x27;s Time NETwork&quot;), the HEPnet (&quot;High Energy Physics Network&quot;) and the UUCP (&quot;Unix-to-Unix Copy Program&quot;). As such, even before Brazil officially connected to the Internet in 1991, the .br domain was used to identify the machines participating in networks already in use by academics.

In 1995 the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (, or simply CGI.br) was created with an objective to coordinate the allocation of Internet addresses (IPs) and the registration of .br domain names. There were 851 domains registered with the Brazilian DNS by the beginning of 1996, thereafter experiencing rapid growth with the mass arrival of companies, Internet providers and media onto the Internet. The registration system was automated in 1997 and was developed using open source software.

In 2005, CGI.br created its own executive arm, the Brazilian Network Information Center (, or simply NIC.br), which currently serves in both administrative and operational capacity for the registry.

In 2017, accounts associated with DNS records of Brazilian banks were hacked. Kaspersky&#x27;s researchers pointed out to a vulnerability in NIC.br&#x27;s website and suggested its infrastructure had been compromised. NIC&#x27;s director at the time, Frederico Neves, denied that NIC.br was &quot;hacked&quot;, although NIC.br admitted the vulnerability.

== Domain registry ==
To register any domains under .br, it is necessary to enter into contact with Registro.br. Entities legally established in Brazil as a company (&quot;pessoa jurídica&quot;) or a physical person (&quot;profissional liberal&quot; and &quot;pessoas físicas&quot;) that has a contact within Brazil can register domains. Foreign companies that have a power-of-attorney legally established in Brazil can also do it by following specific rules.

The registration of domains including non-ASCII Portuguese characters (à, á, â, ã, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, ü and ç) is accepted since 2005.

=== Syntactic rules for .br domains ===
* Minimum of 2 and maximum of 26 characters, not including the category. For example, in the field XXXX.COM.BR, this limitation relates to the XXXX.
* Valid characters are [A-Z, 0-9], the hyphen, and the following accented characters: à, á, â, ã, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, ü, ç.
* Domains cannot contain only numbers.
* To maintain the integrity of the registry, Registro.br sets up an equivalence mapping to compare domain names with and without accented characters. The mapping is done by converting accented characters and the cedilla for their non-accented versions and &quot;c&quot;, respectively, and discards hyphens. A new domain will only be allowed to be registered when there is no equivalent to a pre-existing domain, or when the applicant is the same entity that owns the domain equivalent.

:Specifically for the domain .NOM.BR, it is necessary to choose two names, i.e.: NAME1.NAME2.NOM.BR.

==Second-level domains==
=== Direct registration ===
In 1991, it was decided that universities and research institutes would be allowed second-level .br domains directly. For example: Federal University of Rio de Janeiro got &quot;ufrj.br&quot;; University of São Paulo got &quot;usp.br&quot;; National Institute for Space Research got &quot;inpe.br&quot;; and so on.

In late 2000, the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee reported abuse in this system, and called for all institutions directly under .br to be moved to .edu.br – so, for example, &quot;ufrj.br&quot; would become &quot;ufrj.edu.br&quot;. During a meeting in early 2001, however, the Committee decided it would be of public interest to not move every second-level domain as to avoid confusion, but instead established rules regarding their registration:

* No longer accepting automatic registration of second-level domains, and evaluating every request for one individually;
* Creating edu.br, and forwarding requests from education and research institutions to it;
* Concession to education and research institutes that already had a second-level .br domain, as long as its usage is appropriate and that domain name is related to the institution&#x27;s name or acronym. Domains approved are automatically duplicated under edu.br as well, and both may exist concurrently – for example, the still existing &quot;ufrj.br&quot; also has a registered &quot;ufrj.edu.br&quot;, although the latter is not used;
* Other institutions not approved above must be migrated permanently to edu.br (but would be given sufficient time for the transition).

As of September 2024, Registro.br reports 1207 domains registered directly under .br.

=== Predefined domains ===
As of November 2024, there are 142 different second-level domains of .br under which custom domains can be registered, and they are divided into eleven categories: &quot;Generic&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Culture&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Personals&quot;, &quot;Entertainment&quot;, &quot;Public Authority&quot;, &quot;Locations&quot;, &quot;Professions&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot; and &quot;Third Sector&quot;. They are the following:







==== Special second-level domains ====
From 2000 until 2009, during election cycles, electoral candidates could register domains under CAN.br, with the format &quot;[name][number].can.br&quot; – where the name is the registered candidate name, and the number is the identification number for that candidate in the election (related to the party&#x27;s identification number). The second-level domain was in a category of its own, called &quot;natural persons, special&quot;.

As an example, during the 2004 elections for mayor of Aracaju:

* Marcelo Déda had the website &quot;deda13.can.br&quot; (his surname and Worker&#x27;s Party&#x27;s identification number, 13);
* Susana Azevedo had the website &quot;susana23.can.br&quot; (her first name and Cidadania&#x27;s identification number, 23);
* Jorge Alberto had the website &quot;jorgealberto15.can.br&quot; (his name and MDB&#x27;s identification number, 15).

Domains were free for registered candidates. Additionally, domains were automatically cancelled at the end of the first round if the candidate lost, and remaining ones were cancelled after the end of the second round.

No new .can.br domains have been registered since 2009.

==== Online gambling ====
In late 2024, legislation regulating online gambling in Brazil – usually referred to simply as &quot;bets&quot; in the country – was passed. Among the stipulations was that, from January 2025 onward, such companies must operate under a BET.br domain. By definition, any online gambling websites not operating under a .bet.br domain are operating illegally.

=== Agencies ===
There are multiple agencies registered directly under .br, as second-level domains, that are not higher education or research institutions. The following list might not be exhaustive:

Most of these agencies are subsidiaries of CGI.br and, as such, they follow a similar corporate identity. The &quot;logos&quot; are combinations of the names of the agencies with the logo for .br, all of which are simply typed out with Brandon Schoech (Tepid Monkey)&#x27;s freeware font &quot;Qhytsdakx&quot;:

=== Networks ===
There are multiple networks registered directly under .br, usually of academic nature. Again, this list may not be exhaustive:

== Usage statistics ==
As of September 2024, .BR is the 9th most used TLD in the world and the 6th most used ccTLD, accounting for approximately 1.5% of all domain names. It is also the most used Portuguese language TLD.

As of 9 September 2024, Registro.br&#x27;s statistics page reported the following:

* total domains registered under .BR;
* () domains using DNSSEC.

The &quot;Education&quot; category also includes ( of the total) custom second-level domains registered directly under .BR – for example, the National Observatory at ON.BR.

<text>.bv is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) reserved for the uninhabited Norwegian dependent territory of Bouvet Island. The domain name registry and sponsor is Norid, but is not open for registration. was designated on 21 August 1997 and was placed under the registry Norid. Norwegian policy states that is sufficient for those institutions connected to Bouvet Island, and therefore the domain is not open to registration. It is Norwegian policy not to commercialize domain resources, so there are no plans to sell . Should the domain later come into use, it will be under the regulation of the Norwegian Communications Authority and follow the same policy as .

==History==
Bouvet Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It was claimed by Norway in 1927. The domain was allocated on 21 August 1997, at the same time was allocated for Svalbard and Jan Mayen. The allocation occurred because the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns ccTLDs to all entities with an ISO 3166 code, for which Bouvet Island is designated .

In March 2012, Norid began an initial collaboration with the Dutch domain registry SIDN, with the purpose of examining the possibility of utilizing the domain on the Dutch market. BV is the most common form of limited company in the Netherlands, which could have made a popular domain. The collaboration ended in June 2016, when The Ministry of Transport and Communications advised that dispensation from certain parts of the Norwegian Domain Regulations, which would have opened for the sale of the domain, should not be granted.

In June 2015, Norwegian computer scientist Håkon Wium Lie and the Socialist Left Party proposed using the domain, along with , as online free havens. The proposal aims at protecting both the Norwegian authorities and foreign dissidents from surveillance.

==Policy==
Management of lies with Trondheim-based Norid, which is also the domain name registry for and the unused . Norid is a limited company owned by Uninett, which is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. The legal right to manage the domains is twofold, based both on an agreement with the IANA and regulations via the &quot;Telecommunication Act&quot; which is supervised by the Lillesand-based Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority.

The policy for the use of is regulated by the &quot;Regulation Concerning Domain Names Under Norwegian Country Code Top-level Domains&quot;, also known as the &quot;Domain Regulation&quot;. This regulation also regulates Norway&#x27;s other two ccTLDs, and . Should eventually come into use, the same rules and procedures as those currently regarding would be used for . The domain remains reserved for potential future use.

<text>Lansberg is a lunar impact crater on the Mare Insularum. It can be located by following a line south-southwest from Copernicus to Reinhold, then southwest to Lansberg. The crater has a high rim and a central mountain. There are s along the inner walls, and the tops have slumped to produce a sharp edge. This formation is not noticeably eroded, and there are no significant impact craters within the interior.

The crater is correctly spelled &quot;Lansberg&quot;, but has sometimes been written &quot;Landsberg&quot; instead. It is named for the Belgian/Dutch astronomer Philippe van Lansberge.

Lansberg is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

Approximately 40 km to the southeast of Lansberg is the landing site of the Luna 5 probe, and a further 60 km in the same direction is the landing site of Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lansberg.

<text>.bw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Botswana. It is officially administered by the Botswana Communication Regulatory Authority since 2013, previously being administered by the University of Botswana.

== Operations ==
Most current registrations are at the third level beneath second-level names such as co.bw and org.bw, but some second-level registrations also exist, such as Botswana Telecommunications Corporation&#x27;s website. However, registrations at the second level have been stopped, and all entities who are currently registered under this level will be given a three year grace period to migrate to any other level.

The most visited .bw domain is google.co.bw by Google Inc. in Botswana.

Botswana Communication Regulatory Authority operates a WHOIS service for .bw domains and was previously operated by Botswana Telecommunications Corporation.

<text>.by is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Belarus. It is administered by the Operations and Analysis Centre under the President of the Republic of Belarus (Оперативно-аналитический центр при Президенте Республики Беларусь). The BY code originates from the ISO code for &quot;Byelorussia&quot;, the former name of the country. The ccTLD was created for Belarus on 10 May 1994.

== Eligibility ==
The Operations and Analysis Centre under the President of the Republic of Belarus allows for anyone (not only for those who reside in Belarus) to register a second level domain such as &quot;something&quot;.by. However, third-level domains .gov.by and .mil.by are reserved for government use only. The names chosen for second-level domains must not conflict with those already registered or with well-known brand names. The names also must have two or more Latin characters and they cannot either start or finish with a hyphen (-). Second-level names that might have words or phrases that are deemed to be vulgar or illegal can also be rejected by the Administrator of ccTLD BY.

== History ==
At the very beginning there was only one company in Belarus which carried out the registration of domains .by – Open Contact Ltd. In October 2006 two other Belarusian companies got the licence to provide technical protection of information, including its execution by cryptographic means, and comprising the usage of a digital signature. Those were Reliable Software Inc. and Business Network JV. The former one has started to receive inquiries and carry out domain registration since 27 March 2007. On 3 September 2007 the licence was granted also to Extmedia and on 29 June to Active Technologies. At present each of the five companies carries out domain registration officially. Since 1994 the only Technical Administrator of the .by domain has been Open Contact Ltd.

According to the results of the competition conducted in September 2010 by the Operations and Analysis Centre (OAC), the authorised government body for the purposes of security of the Internet, the .by domain was redelegated to Reliable Software Inc. (hoster.by). On 7 February 2012 ICANN approved the candidacy of the company unequivocally.

In 2007 while Open Contact Ltd. was the Technical Administrator of the .by domain it announced the reduction of price on national domains from (US$88) to ($60). This measure triggered the process of transmission of Belarusian web-sites from generic top-level domains to the national one.

Since 2012, when Reliable Software Inc. (hoster.by) became the Technical Administrator of the .by domain, several changes have been adopted: the assessment of inquiries in the Operations and Analysis Centre (OAC) and a free 30-day reservation of a domain name have been eliminated and WHOIS-service has started to work.

== Fees ==
Since 2011 due to changes in currency exchange rate the price has decreased. The costs to use a .by domain is a US$12 fee for the first year and second payment of $12 to maintain the domain. The renewal of the domain occurs yearly. The maximum upfront payment is 1 years. The payment of the fees occur by bank transfer, WebMoney, credit card or cash depending on the registrar.

== Internationalized country code top-level domain ==
Belarus applied for the Cyrillic top-level domain .бел, intended to be used with subdomains in the same script, which was approved by the ICANN in 2015.

== Other uses ==

The .by code is used for domain hack by institutions from the German state of Bavaria (), such as bayern.by, the Bavarian Tourism Agency. Since &quot;&quot; means &quot;town&quot; or &quot;city&quot; in Norwegian, it&#x27;s also used by some Norwegian newspapers, such as osl.by for an Oslo newspaper, and trd.by for a Trondheim newspaper.

<text>Bamber Bridge Football Club is a football club based in Bamber Bridge, near Preston, Lancashire, England. They are currently members of the and play at the Sir Tom Finney Stadium. The club is fully owned by a community organisation that represents supporters of the club.

==History==
A Bamber Bridge club played in the late 19th century, but the modern club was established in 1952. The new club joined the Preston &amp; District League, progressing to the Senior Division. In 1974 they merged with Walton-le-Dale, continuing in the Preston &amp; District League. They went on to win the league&#x27;s Guildhall Cup in 1978–79, before completing a Premier Division and cup double in 1980–81. After winning the Lancashire FA Amateur Shield in 1981–82 and another Guildhall Cup win in 1984–85, they won back-to-back Premier Division titles in the next two seasons, before winning a league and cup double in 1989–90.

In 1990 Bamber Bridge moved up to Division Two of the North West Counties League. Their second season in the league saw them win the division, resulting in promotion to Division One; they also reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, where they lost 2–0 to Wimborne Town. After finishing as runners-up in Division One in the following season (1992–93), a second successive promotion was achieved when the club moved up to Division One of the Northern Premier League.

In 1994–95, a second-place finish saw Bamber Bridge promoted to the Premier Division, with the club also winning the league&#x27;s Challenge Cup in their first season in the league and victory in the final of the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy. The following season they won the Premier Division, which would have usually resulted in promotion to the Football Conference. However, Irongate was not deemed up to standard for the fifth tier, and the club remained in the Northern Premier League,

In 1999–2000 Bamber Bridge reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. After beating St Albans City 2–0, they lost 1–0 at Cambridge United in the second round. The club remained in the Premier Division until the end of the 2001–02 season, in which they finished bottom; although they beat Radcliffe Borough 3–2 in the promotion/relegation play-off semi-final, they were beaten 2–1 by Ashton United in the final.

Although Bamber Bridge returned to the Premier Division as a result of league restructuring following the creation of the Conference North and South, their stay was short-lived as they were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2004–05 season. However, the season did see them win the President&#x27;s Cup. When the league added a third division in 2007, the club were placed in Division One North.

A fourth-place finish in 2013–14 saw Bamber Bridge qualify for the promotion play-offs. After beating Warrington Town 1–0 in the semi-finals, they lost 3–2 to Ramsbottom United in the final. In the following season they finished third, again qualifying for the play-offs, this time losing 2–0 to Darlington 1883 in the final after beating Northwich Victoria 2–1 in the semi-final. A fourth-place finish in 2017–18 saw the club reach the play-offs, in which they defeated Tadcaster Albion 2–1 in the semi-finals and Prescot Cables 1–0 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The club qualified for the play-offs again in 2022–23 after finishing third in the league; following a 5–4 win on penalties against Gainsborough Trinity in the semi-finals (after a 1–1 draw), they lost the final 1–0 to Warrington Town.

==Ground==
Following the 1974 merger, the club played at the King George&#x27;s Playing Field. In 1983 they purchased a plot of derelict land to build their own ground, with the name Irongate taken from the local area. The first game was played in August 1987. The ground was officially named the Sir Tom Finney Stadium after Finney&#x27;s death in 2014. It currently has a capacity of 2,642, of which 499 is seated.

The record attendance of 2,300 was set for a friendly match against the Czech Republic national team shortly before Euro 96, as the Czechs were using Irongate as a training ground; the result was a 9–1 win for the Czechs. The ground has also formerly hosted the home games of the Preston North End women&#x27;s team and Blackburn Rovers Ladies (2016–2022).

<text>Le Monnier is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that has been partly inundated by lava flows. It was named after French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. It is located on the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, and the western part of the rim is missing so that it now forms a large bay. To the north is the crater Chacornac.

The interior of this formation is relatively flat and smooth, with no significant craterlets to mark the surface. The outer rim is battered, worn, and notched with past impacts. Only slight wrinkle ridges now mark where the western rim once lay.

The landing site of the Luna 21 space probe is located near the southern rim of Le Monnier. Lunokhod 2, a robotic roving vehicle deposited on the surface by Luna 21, covered a distance of 37 kilometers across the crater floor. It also surveyed the southern edge of the crater rim.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Le Monnier. 

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Le Monnier B — &quot;See&quot; Very (lunar crater).
* Le Monnier C — &quot;See&quot; Borel (crater).

<text>A Master of Engineering (abbreviated MEng, ME, M.E. or M.Eng.) is a professional master&#x27;s degree in the field of engineering.

==International variations==

===Australia===
In Australia, the Master of Engineering degree is a research degree requiring completion of a thesis. Like the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master&#x27;s degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework, and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.

===Finland===
There are two distinct degrees in Finland, a taught university degree (&quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot;) and a polytechnic master&#x27;s degree&#x27;s (&quot;insinööri (ylempi AMK)&quot;). While the former is translated as &quot;Master of Science in Technology&quot;, the term &quot;Master of Engineering&quot; is predominantly used by Universities of Applied Sciences, which offer master&#x27;s degree programs to holders of polytechnic bachelor&#x27;s degrees (&quot;insinööri (amk)&quot;). As European Bologna process directs, in order to get an M. Eng. degree, B.Eng. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a master&#x27;s thesis. Most of the M. Eng. degree programs are taught in Finnish, but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.

===France===
In France there are two distinct kinds of Master of Engineering. A master&#x27;s degree taught in university and an engineer degree Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur taught in engineer schools, which is a parallel education system of university, named Grande école. Master of engineering and engineer&#x27;s degree are both equal in term of level education, and generally leads to the same positions. The engineer&#x27;s title in France is strictly protected and can be used only after a successful graduation in an Engineer School accredited by state. While a university&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree of engineering is a grade which does not give the right to use the Engineer&#x27;s title, even if position&#x27;s level and responsibilities are same. For the same reason, Bachelor of Engineering does not allow a graduate to be called &quot;Engineer&quot; or to work as an engineer. To work as an engineer requires 5 years of education in university or Engineer&#x27;s school and using the title of engineer requires graduation from an engineer school.

===Germany===
In Germany, the local engineer&#x27;s degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after five years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after four years of study) were abolished in most universities and &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.).

The first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the Bologna process. This type of master&#x27;s degree is usually offered by &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; (Universities of Applied Sciences) and a few smaller German universities and is typically a two-year program (fachhochschulen and universities) with application-oriented coursework and an applied or research thesis.

The entry requirement is the successful completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks.

The nine leading German technical universities (Group of TU9), like most European universities of technology, prefer awarding the Master of Science degree for completing engineering science studies in a master&#x27;s program.

=== India ===
The Master of Engineering (M.E.) is a postgraduate degree in engineering, typically awarded after two years of advanced study. It offers specializations in fields such as Computer Science and Engineering, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, and Structural Engineering. The M.E. is considered a path for in-depth technical expertise and career advancement in the engineering sector. The Eligibility is a Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering like B.E./B.Tech/AMIE in an engineering discipline. Admission often requires performance in the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering), though some universities may have their own entrance exams.

An M.E. degree opens doors to advanced roles in industry, academia, or research. Graduates work in sectors like software, telecommunications, automotive, construction, and energy. Many M.E. graduates also pursue a Ph.D. or take up teaching roles. The M.E. degree in India provides engineers with advanced knowledge and expertise, enhancing career opportunities in both technical and managerial roles across various industries.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities (University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, etc.). Similar to the UK&#x27;s Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master&#x27;s degree.

In Auckland University of Technology (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway).

===Slovakia===
FIIT STU Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) accreditation for two master&#x27;s degree study programs: Intelligent Software Systems (combined fields of study Software Engineering – major and Artificial Intelligence – secondary) and Internet Technologies (in the field of study Computing Engineering); three bachelor&#x27;s degree study programs and two doctoral degree study programs.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng) is the highest award for undergraduate studies in engineering. It is the standard university-level qualification taken by people wishing to become chartered engineers registered with the Engineering Council (EngC). The MEng degree represents the minimum educational standard required to become a chartered engineer, but there are other equally satisfactory ways to demonstrate this standard, such as the completion of a BEng Honours and a subsequent postgraduate diploma, MA or MSc or through experiential learning. The UK MEng (undergraduate degree) is typically equivalent to the European &quot; Diplom Ingenieur&quot; (Dipl.-Ing.) and &quot; Civilingenjör&quot; degrees.

Universities are free to set their own entry requirements. Some universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge and some courses at Imperial only admit students to study for the MEng degree. (Their courses usually allow a student to leave with a bachelor&#x27;s degree after three years. More information on which courses are accredited by the Engineering Council for registration as a Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer can be found at https://www.engc.org.uk/education-skills/accreditation-of-higher-education-programmes/) Other universities, such as the University of Greenwich, University of Surrey, Coventry University, Brunel University and Swansea University, admit students to read for BEng Honours and MEng courses and allow students to change between the two during the early years of the course. The Open University offers the MEng degree as a postgraduate qualification but requires students to complete its course within four years of completing a BEng Honours degree.

Requirements for professional registration as an Incorporated Engineer or a Chartered Engineer is based on a standard of professional competence and commitment, as set out in the professional standard UK-SPEC. Individuals generally develop these through education and working experience.

====History====
Since its introduction, the MEng has become the degree of choice for most undergraduate engineers, as was intended. The most common exception to this is international students who, because of the substantially higher fees they are charged, sometimes opt to take the tradition BEng/B.Sc. route where that is available. Most of the engineering institutions have now made an MEng the minimum academic standard necessary to become a Chartered Engineer. Students who graduated before the changes in the rules will still be allowed to use their bachelor&#x27;s degree for this purpose and those who have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree since the changes can usually take some additional courses (known as &#x27;further learning&#x27;) over time to reach an equivalent standard to the MEng Some older universities such as Durham allow students to obtain the BEng degree after the third year before continuing on to the fourth year.

===United States===
In the United States, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a professional degree offered as a coursework-based alternative to the traditional research-based Master of Science. It is typically a one-year program, entered after the completion of a 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree and many universities allow students to choose between the Master of Engineering and the Master of Science.

The Master of Engineering degree is offered at many leading universities in the United States on either a full-time and part-time (weekends or evenings) basis.

Some MEng degree programs require a scholarly project in addition to coursework. They require additional courses beyond those required for Master of Science students in order to better prepare students for professional careers. Some of them highly encourage students to participate in collaborative consulting projects. These courses may include topics such as business fundamentals, management and leadership.

<text>.bz is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Belize. It is administered by the University of Belize.

== Usage ==
At one point, .bz domains were being marketed by an American company as standing for &quot;business&quot;, and that company took legal action against ICANN in an attempt to block the .biz domain as &quot;unfair competition&quot;. 

Currently, the registry is in Belize, but is still marketing the domain outside the country as &quot;meaning business&quot;. Internationalized domains with a wide assortment of non-ASCII characters are also available.

== Domains ==
There are some second-level domains in use, however these are not required:

It also might have use for typosquatting for misspellings of .biz domains.

=== Domain hack ===
Many websites in Italy use this domain, because of the abbreviation of Bolzano, the capital of the province of South Tyrol, and the fact that the official abbreviation of the province is BZ. Many websites use the Italian subdomain .bz.it. 

Servers for the open source game &quot;BZFlag&quot; often use names ending in .bz.

<text>Albert Rothenberg (born June 2, 1930) is an American psychiatrist who has carried out long term research on the creative process in literature, art, science and psychotherapy. As Principal Investigator of the research project &quot;Studies in the Creative Process&quot;, Rothenberg has focused on the creative processes of consensually recognized and defined creators. These have included Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine and physiology; Pulitzer Prize and other literary prize winners; and consensually designated young literary and artistic creators.

He has also practiced clinical psychiatry and been administrator and therapist at the Yale Psychiatric Institute, New Haven, Connecticut; John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington, Connecticut; the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, as well as undertakinging private psychiatric outpatient practice in Chatham, New York.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Rothenberg was born in New York City on June 2, 1930, to Gabriel Rothenberg and Rose Goldberg Rothenberg. His father Gabriel was born in Romania and came to the United States at the age of seventeen. At 23 years old, Gabriel fought in the US Army during the First World War. Other than attending night school for English, Gabriel had no formal advanced education but later become a successful manufacturing businessman in Danbury, Connecticut. His mother, born in New Haven, Connecticut, was a pianist and became a principal secretary after attending a New York City secretarial school. An eldest brother died immediately after childbirth and Rothenberg&#x27;s -year-older brother, Jerome Rothenberg, who was quite sickly as a child, survived to become a distinguished American Economist. Rothenberg attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York where he graduated as Salutatorian.

=== Career ===

As an undergraduate at Harvard College, Rothenberg majored in Social Relations and graduated with honors. There, he was influenced to pursue later research in creativity through the example and thought of psychologists Henry Murray and George Klein. His medical career began at Tufts University School of Medicine where he was awarded both the annual Dermatology Prize and Medical Alumni Award. After graduation as doctor of medicine he went on to pursue residency training in psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.

In 1960, he was appointed to the Yale Medical School faculty. During early years at Yale, he was supported in research and teaching by two successive 5-year federal Research Career Investigator Grants. There was an interruption of two years when Rothenberg served as Captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps as Chief Psychiatrist for American military personnel in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean area. For this service, he received both a Letter of commendation and a Certificate of Merit. He then returned to Yale Medical School, where he remained for nearly 20 years.

In 1976, Rothenberg moved to the University of Connecticut Department Of Psychiatry at Farmington, where he served as the Clinical Director and Director of Psychiatric Residency for the next three years. In 1979, he became the Director of Research at the Austen Riggs Center, an open psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty.

Rothenberg was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard in 1986. The same year, he began a course of three separate research years as a Fellow at institutes for advanced study. In 1986, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University; In 1993, he was a Fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Wassenaar; and he returned as a Fellow to CASBS in 2014.

In addition to his research on creativity, he has published two novels: &quot;Living Color&quot; (2001), a story about the slashing of a famous painting in the modern art museum in Amsterdam and &quot;Madness and Glory&quot; (2012), a story about Dr. Phillipe Pinel, the father of modern psychiatry.

=== Research ===
Rothenberg has carried out controlled experimental research with young writers and artists and controlled interview investigations with outstanding prize-winning authors. He found that three interrelated cognitive processes were responsible for their creative achievements. Also, through extensive and intensive research with Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry the same processes were found to be operating in their far-reaching and outstanding creative achievements. The three cognitive processes, all of which disrupt the past and the usual and lead to creations are:

&quot;Janusian process&quot; (previously designated as &quot;janusian thinking&quot;; derived from the Roman god &quot;Janus&quot;), consists of actively conceiving and using multiple opposite or antithetical thoughts or constructions simultaneously. The janusian process leads to creation in conceptual and verbal modalities.

&quot;Homospatial process&quot; (derived from Greek &quot;homo&quot;) consists of actively conceiving and using two or more discrete entities in the same mental space, a conception leading to the articulation of new identities. The homospatial process leads to creation primarily in the metaphoric and spatial modalities.

&quot;Sep-con articulation process&quot; consists of actively conceiving and using separation (sep) and connection (con) concomitantly. The sep-con articulation process leads to integrative effects and integration in creation.

==== Significance ====
Although, as commonly used, the term creativity has been applied to a wide range of behavior, events, and practices, these have often consisted of simply different or deviant, uncommon, or unusual occurrences. Many studies have been derived from personal intuition or anecdotes, and have often focused simply on skills, divergent thinking or employment in particular types of artistic or scientific occupations. On an operational basis, however, creativity and creative activity is positively valued, usually definitively so, and the value must be consensually validated and stand the test of time.

Moreover, creativity differs from productivity or competence alone—it consists of yielding something novel or new. Rothenberg&#x27;s work and findings have consistently focused on a strict definition of creativity as the state or production of both &quot;newness&quot; and &quot;value&quot; (intrinsic or instrumental). Clear-cut results and applications of these investigations have measured, in whole or in part, all types and levels of creativity. The findings produced by his research consist, for the first time, of empirically determined highly specific and operational types of creative processes. These have been described through his work in the fields of science and literature, visual art, and psychotherapy.

=== Personal life ===
Rothenberg is married to Julia Johnson Rothenberg, Emerita Professor of Education at Sage Colleges and noted visual artist and musician. They divide residence each year between homes in the U.S. and southern France.

<text>Lee is the lava-flooded remnant of a lunar impact crater that lies on an inlet of the Mare Humorum, in the southwestern part of the Moon. It was named after British astronomer John Lee. To the east is the crater Vitello, and just to the north is the lava-flooded crater Doppelmayer.

The rim of Lee is worn and somewhat eroded, with a wide gap along the northeast where lava entered and covered the floor. The interior is relatively flat and free of significant impacts. The craterlet Lee A is attached to the exterior of the southern rim of Lee.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lee.

<doc id="999808" wikidata="Q1137067" url="?curid=999808" title="Ovambo people">
<text>The Ovambo people (), also called Aawambo, Ambo, Aawambo (Ndonga, Nghandjera, Kwambi, Kwaluudhi, Kolonghadhi, Mbalantu, mbadja), or Ovawambo (Kwanyama), are a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa, primarily modern Namibia. They are the single largest ethnic group in Namibia, accounting for about half of the population. Despite concerted efforts from Christian missionaries to wipe out what they believed to be &#x27;pagan practices&#x27;, the Ovambo have retained many aspects of their traditional cultural practices. They are also found in the southern Angolan province of Cunene, where they are more commonly referred to as &quot;Ambo&quot;. 

The Ovambo consist of a number of kindred Bantu ethnic tribes who inhabit what was formerly called Ovamboland. In Angola, they are a minority, accounting for about two percent of the total Angolan population.

In the early 21st century, the Ovambo ethnic group numbered about 2 million people. They are predominantly of the Lutheran (97%) and traditional faiths (3%), the former having followed conversion by German missionaries.

==Demographics==

The Ovambo people reside in the flat sandy grassy plains of north Namibia and the Cunene Province in southwestern Angola, sometimes referred to as Ovamboland. These plains are generally flat, without many stones, and located at a high altitude.

Water courses, known as &quot;oshanas&quot;, irrigate the area. In the northern regions of Ovamboland, tropical vegetation is sustained by abundant but seasonal rainfall that floods the region, creating temporary lakes and islands. In dry season, these pools of water empty out. The Ovambo have adapted to the widely varying seasonal weather patterns with their housing, agriculture, and livestock practices.

The Ovambo people are a Bantu-speaking group. In Namibia, these are the AaNdonga, Ovakwanyama, Aakwambi, Aangandjera, Aambalantu, Ovaunda, Aakolonkadhi, Aakwaluudhi and Aambandja. In Angola, they are the Ovakwanyama, Aakafima, Evale and Aandonga. The Ovakwanyama are the largest sub-tribe.

==History==
The Ovambo started migrating to their current location around the 14th century from the Zambia region to the northeast. They settled near the Angola-Namibia border, with expansion further south into Namibia in the 17th century. They have a close cultural, linguistic and historical relationship to the Herero people, who are found in more southern parts of Namibia, and Kavango people to their east, who settled around the Okavango River.

In contrast to most ethnic groups in Africa, the Ovambo people were largely unaffected by Swahili-Arab and European traders before the 19th century. They were relatively isolated and had a low-density, pastoral and nomadic lifestyle.

When Germany established a colony in Namibia in 1884, they left the Ovambo people undisturbed. The Germans focused on the southern and coastal regions which were better for resources and trading. After World War I and the victory of the Allies, the South African government annexed Namibia into the Union of South Africa. It was known as the Territory of South West Africa. This brought major changes. The South Africans introduced large plantations, cattle ranching, and mining operations to the Ovamboland. 

The Portuguese colonial administration in Angola, who had previously focused on their coastal, northern and eastern operations, entered southern Angola to form a border to defend against the expanding South African presence. The Ovambo people launched several armed rebellions against South African rule in the 1920s and 1930s, which were all suppressed by the Union Defence Force.

The South African administration in Namibia continued the so-called &quot;Police Zone&quot; in the south. This region was created by the Germans with a veterinary Red Line covering about two-thirds of the province that later became Namibia. 

The Ovambo were not allowed to move into the Police Zone, neither could other tribes nor Europeans move north without permits. This isolated the Ovambo people. Their traditional authorities were preserved and the number of White farmers in the north was reduced. 

However, because of a labor shortage in the Police Zone and South Africa, in part because of the massacre of native Africans through such actions as the Herero and Namaqua genocide, the South African government allowed migrant wage labor. Numerous Ovambo people became migrant laborers in South African towns such as Cape Town and in the Police Zone. They were constrained by racial segregation and lived under highly restricted human rights.

In 1948, with a change in government after World War II, South Africa introduced Apartheid rule to the Ovamboland. 

The South African government declared the Ovamboland an independent province in 1973. But they appointed chiefs who were aligned with the South African government&#x27;s policies. The Ovambo people rejected these developments. In 1975 the appointed chief minister of Ovamboland was assassinated. In conjunction with the armed SWAPO movement, Namibia and its Ovambo people gained independence from South Africa in 1990.

==Religion==
===Traditional religion===
The traditional religion of the Ovambo people is the primary faith of less than 3%. In the 21st century, most state Christianity as their primary faith. The Ovambo&#x27;s traditional religion envisions a supreme being named &quot;Kalunga&quot;, with their rites and rituals centered around sacred fire. This is similar to religious traditions of many ethnic groups in southwestern Africa. The &quot;Kalunga&quot; cosmology states that the Supreme Being created the first man and first woman, who had a daughter and two sons. It is the daughter&#x27;s lineage that created the Ovambo people. Their traditional beliefs are expressed through their matrilineal kinship system.

The rituals involve elaborate fire making and keeping ceremonies, a rain making dance, and the use of herbs and smoke. Certain rites include throwing herbs in the fire and inhaling the rising smoke. The head priest traditionally was the king of a tribe. His role in part was to attend to the supernatural spirits and be the chief representative of the Ovambo tribe to the deities.

===Christianity===

Christianity arrived among the Ovambo people in the late 19th century. The first Finnish missionaries arrived in Ovamboland in the 1870s. They were Lutheran and influenced the conversion of Ovambo people to that Protestant faith. The Finnish missions influenced both religion and cultural practices. For example, the typical dress style of contemporary Ovambo women, which includes a head scarf and loose full-length maxi, was derived from those of the 19th-century Finnish missionaries.

The Ovambo now predominantly follow Christian theology, prayer rituals and festivities. Some traditional religious practices have continued, such as the use of ritual sacred fire. They also invoke their supreme creator &quot;Kalunga&quot;. Thus, the Ovamba have adopted a syncretic form of Christianity. 

Most weddings, for instance, feature a combination of Christian beliefs and Ovambo traditions. Their traditional dancing is done to drumming (Oshiwambo folk music).

==Society and culture==

The traditional home is a complex of huts surrounded by a fence of large vertical poles linked by two horizontal poles on each side. The complex is a maze with two gates but it is easy to get lost within the homestead. Each hut generally has a different purpose, such as a &quot;Ondjugo&quot; (the woman of the homestead&#x27;s hut) or &quot;Epata&quot; (kitchen area).

The Ovambo people lead a settled life, relying mostly on a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. The staple crops have been millet and sorghum (&quot;iilyavala&quot;), and beans (&quot;omakunde&quot;) are another popular crop. In drier regions or seasons, pastoral activity with herds of cattle (&quot;eengobe&quot;/&quot;eenghwandabi&quot;), goats (&quot;iikombo&quot;/&quot;onakamela&quot;) and sheep (&quot;eedi&quot;) becomes more important. The animal husbandry is not for meat (&quot;ombelela&quot;), but primarily as a source of milk (&quot;omashini&quot;). Their food is supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering.

During the colonial era, the Ovambo were active in elephant (&quot;eenjaba&quot;) hunting for their tusks to supply the ivory demand, and they nearly hunted the elephants in their region to extinction.
Each Ovambo tribe had a hereditary chief who is responsible for the tribe. Many tribes adapted representation by having a council of headmen who run tribal affairs. Members of the royal family of the Owamboland are known as &quot;aakwanekamba&quot;, &quot;ovakwaluvala&quot;, &quot;ovakwamalanga&quot;, &quot;ovakwaanime&quot;, &quot;aakwanyoka&quot; and many more; only those who belong to this family by birth, through the maternal line, have a claim to chieftainship. The tribes figure their descent by a matrilineal kinship system, with hereditary chiefs arising from the daughter&#x27;s children, not the son&#x27;s. Polygyny is accepted, with the first wife recognized as the senior.
Ovambo brew a traditional liquor called &quot;ombike&quot;. It is distilled from fermented fruit mash and particularly popular in rural areas. The fruit to produce ombike are collected from makalani palms (&quot;Hyphaene petersiana&quot;), jackal berries (&quot;Diospyros mespiliformis&quot;), buffalo thorns (&quot;Ziziphus mucronata&quot;), bird plumes and cluster figs (&quot;Ficus racemosa&quot;). &quot;Ombike&quot;, with additives like sugar, is also brewed and consumed in urban areas. This liquor is then called &quot;omangelengele&quot;; it is more potent and sometimes poisonous. &quot;New Era&quot;, a Namibian English-language daily newspaper, reported that clothes, shoes, and tyres have been found to have been brewed as ingredients of &quot;omangelengele&quot;.

<text>The Pangboche Hand is an artifact from a Buddhist monastery in Pangboche, Nepal. Supporters contend that the hand is from a Yeti, a scientifically unrecognized animal purported to live in the Himalayan mountains. A finger bone from the hand was tested and the DNA shown to be human.

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
According to members of the Pangboche monastery, Lama Sangwa Dorje once walked into a cave to meditate. During his stay, a yeti revered him, bringing him food, water and fuel, and eventually became his Buddhist disciple. When the yeti died, Sangwa collected the hand and scalp and took them back to the monastery, where they remained as sacred relics, periodically paraded around the village as a fertility ritual, until they were discovered in the modern age.

=== Western discovery and initial theft by Byrne ===
Oil businessman and adventurer Tom Slick first heard accounts of a &quot;Yeti hand&quot; held as a ritual artifact in the monastery at Pangboche during one of his first &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot; treks in 1957. The Slick expeditions were the first to bring photographs of the hand back to the West.

During later Tom Slick-sponsored expeditions in and around the Himalayas, his associates gathered more information on the &quot;Pangboche hand,&quot; and an effort to further examine it was planned. In 1959, a member of Slick&#x27;s expedition that year, Peter Byrne, reportedly stole pieces of the artifact after the monks who owned it refused to allow its removal for study. Byrne stated that he was shown what looked to be a large, mummified primate hand. Byrne claimed to have replaced the stolen bone fragments with human bones, rewrapping the hand to disguise his theft.

Byrne smuggled the bones from Nepal into India, after which actor James Stewart allegedly smuggled the hand out of the country in his luggage, bypassing security by hiding it among his wife&#x27;s undergarments. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman rediscovered this story while writing Tom Slick&#x27;s biography in the 1980s. Coleman confirmed details of the incidents with written materials in the Slick archives, interviews with Byrne, and correspondence with Stewart. Byrne later confirmed the Pangboche hand story via a letter from Stewart that Byrne published in a general book on Nepalese wildlife.

During the highly publicized 1960 World Book expedition, which had many goals including gathering intelligence on Chinese rocket launchings, Sir Edmund Hillary and Marlin Perkins took a sidetrip in Nepal to investigate the hand. Hillary was unaware of the possibility that he was looking at a combination of the original material and the human bones placed there by Byrne. Hillary determined the artifact was a hoax.

=== Later studies and developments ===
London University primatologist William Charles Osman Hill conducted a physical examination of the pieces that Byrne supplied. His first findings were that it was hominid in nature, and later in 1960 he decided that the Pangboche fragments were a closer match with a Neanderthal.

In 1991, in conjunction with Coleman&#x27;s research, it was discovered that the Slick expedition consultant and American anthropologist George Agogino had retained samples of the alleged Yeti hand. The NBC program &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; obtained samples and determined they were similar to human tissue, but were not human, and could only verify they were &quot;near human.&quot; After the broadcast of the program, the entire hand was stolen from the Pangboche monastery, and reportedly disappeared into a private collection via the illegal underground in the sale of antiquities. George Agogino, before his death on September 11, 2000, transferred his important files on the Pangboche Yeti hand to Loren Coleman.

In 2010, Wētā Workshop produced a replica skull and hand based on photos of the missing hand and skull. Mike Allsop handed over the replica skull and hand to monks at Pangboche in May 2011.

On 27 December 2011 it was announced that a finger belonging to the hand contained human DNA, following tests carried out in Edinburgh. Rob Ogden commented that &quot;We have got a very, very strong match to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases... Human was what we were expecting and human is what we got.&quot;

<text>Lichtenberg is an isolated lunar impact crater located in the western part of the Oceanus Procellarum. The nearest crater of note is Briggs to the south.

Lichtenberg has a small system of rays, a characteristic of Copernican Period craters. The rays extend to the north and west of the crater but not elsewhere. The remaining flanks of the surface about the crater exhibit the low albedo of the lunar mare, and several mare flows have overlaid the existing rays on the east and south sides of the crater. These are thus among the youngest deposits of basaltic lava on the Moon, and are believed to be less than 1 billion years in age based on high-resolution crater statistics of the thin superposed lava flow. The most recent lunar geologic map (2020) identifies the older mare next to Lichtenberg as being as Upper Imbrian.

Lunar scientist Paul Spudis advocates an unmanned sample-return mission to the young mare to obtain an absolute radiometric date that would constrain the time period of the formation of the maria on the moon.

The rim of this crater is circular and sharp-edged, with negligible wear. On the inner sides the loose material has slid to the base, forming a ring of scree about the interior floor. Both the rim and the interior floor exhibit a relatively high albedo, which is usually an indication of a younger crater that has not been darkened by space weathering. Lichtenberg overlies a larger, ring-shaped ghost crater to the northwest, which has a low central rise. This feature is covered by ray material.

Lichtenberg has been noted in the past for occurrences of transient lunar phenomenon. These typically take the form of a temporary, red-hued patch.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lichtenberg.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Lichtenberg G — &quot;See&quot; Humason (crater).

<text>José Eustasio Rivera Salas (February 19, 1888 – December 1, 1928) was a Colombian lawyer and author primarily known for his national epic &quot;The Vortex&quot;.

==Early life==
José Eustasio Rivera was born on February 19, 1888, in Aguas Calientes, a hamlet of the city of Neiva, later that year the hamlet was incorporated into the newly created municipality of San Mateo, which was later renamed Rivera in honour of José Eustasio. His parents were Eustasio Rivera Escobar and Catalina Salas, and he was the first boy and fifth child out of eleven children, of whom eight reached adulthood: José Eustasio, Luis Enrique, Margarita, Virginia, Laura, Susana, Julia and Ernestina.

In spite of his family&#x27;s economic situation, he received a Catholic education thanks to the help of other relatives and his own efforts. He attended Santa Librada school in Neiva and then San Luis Gonzaga in Elías. In 1906 he received a scholarship to study at the normal school in Bogotá. In 1909, after graduating, he moved to Ibagué where he worked as a school inspector. In 1912 he enrolled at the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences of National University, graduating as a lawyer in 1917.

==Career==
After a failed attempt to be elected to the senate, he was appointed Legal Secretary of the Colombo-Venezuelan Border Commission to determine the limits with Venezuela, there he had the opportunity to travel through the Colombian jungles, rivers, and mountains, giving him a first hand experience of the subjects he would later write. Disappointed with the lack of resources offered by his government for his trip, he abandoned the commission and continued travelling on his own. He later rejoined the commission, but before that he went to Brazil, where he became acquainted with the work of important Brazilian writers of his time, particularly Euclides da Cunha. In this venture he became familiar with life in the Colombian plains and with problems related to the extraction of rubber in the Amazon jungle, a matter that would be central in his major work, &quot;La vorágine&quot; (1924) (translated as &quot;The Vortex&quot;), now considered one of the most important novels in Latin American literary history. To write this novel he read extensively about the situation of rubber workers in the Amazon basin.

After the success of his novel, he was elected, in 1925, as a member for the Investigative Commission for Exterior Relations and Colonization. He also published several articles in newspapers in Colombia. In these pieces, he criticized irregularities in government contracts, and denounced the abandonment of the rubber areas of Colombia and the mistreatment of workers. He also publicly defended his novel, which had been criticized by some Colombian literary critics as being too poetic. This criticism would be largely silenced by the wide praise the novel was receiving everywhere else.

==Death==
Rivera had arrived in New York the last week of April 1928 in the hopes of translating his novel into English, publishing it in the United States, and turning it into a motion picture film with the goal of exporting Colombian culture abroad. His venture, although riddled with difficulties, was moving along when on November 27 he suffered an attack of seizures and was taken to the Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital where he remained for four days in a comatose state until his death on December 1, 1928.

After his death, his body was transported by ship from New York to Barranquilla on the United Fruit Company&#x27;s ship the &quot;Sixaola&quot;. At his arrival on port, his body was transported in procession to the Pro-Cathedral of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino where a requiem mass was given and the body laid in &quot;chapelle ardente&quot;. The casket then made its way down the Magdalena onto Bogotá on the mail steamship &quot;Carbonell González&quot;, arriving in Girardot and finishing by train to arrive in Bogotá on January 7, 1929, and was taken directly to the Capitolio Nacional, where it was placed lying in state for public viewing. His body was finally laid to rest in the Central Cemetery of Bogotá on January 19.

<text>Rangers International Football Club, commonly known as Enugu Rangers, is a Nigerian professional association football team founded in 1970. Based in Enugu, the Rangers play their home games at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Enugu Rangers are one of the three oldest clubs in Nigeria, the other two being Bendel Insurance and Kano Pillars, and the only Nigerian club never to have been relegated from the Nigeria Premier League.

==History==
===The 1970s===
Enugu Rangers won a nationally organized tournament in 1970 which allowed them to qualify for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. Rangers lost in the quarterfinal 0–3 on aggregate to ASEC Mimosas.

In the same year, they almost achieved domestic success in the Nigerian FA Cup cup as well, but lost the final 2–1 to Shooting Stars F.C.

After winning the 1974 double, including a 2–0 cup final win over Mighty Jets, the Enugu players were given cars and promotions at the Nigerian Sports Council.

Rangers lost the 1975 African Cup of Champions Clubs to Guinea&#x27;s Hafia FC, earning left-back Silvanus Okpala the nickname &quot;Hafia&quot; for his poor play in the final. Enugu had overturned a 3–1 defeat in Egypt in the semifinal to qualify for the final. Founding Ranger Ernest Ufele retired after the defeat.

In 1977, the club, now managed by their first-ever captain, Godwin Achebe, faced ASF Police of Dakar in the quarterfinals. Held to a goalless draw at home, Rangers took the lead twenty minutes into the second half of the away leg, silencing the Senegal stadium, and eventually winning the match 2–1. After the game ended, team members were physically assaulted by Senegalese fans, according to Nigerian press reports, and three were stabbed. A military plane was flown to Dakar to evacuate the victors.

The 1977 semi-finals set up one of the greatest ties in Nigerian football history as Rangers were drawn against Shooting Stars. Rangers would go on to defeat Canon Yaounde 5–2 on aggregate in the final, including a 4–1 win on Nigerian soil.

During this time period, Rangers boasted a number of Nigerian national team players such as Christian Chukwu, goalkeeper Emmanuel Okala Aloysius Atuegbu and Luke Jaz Bucana Okpala.

===The 1980s===
Led by coach Christian Chukwu, Enugu Rangers won the 1983 Nigerian Cup, defeating DIC Bees of Kaduna 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.

Rangers won their sixth title in 1984 with a number of players who had led Nigeria to the 1980 African Cup of Nations. Louis Igwilo captained the team.

===The 1990s: lean years===
Rangers joined the new fully professional league in 1990 and made cup final that year, losing to Stationery Stores on 5–4 on penalty kicks. They would not make another cup final appearance in the decade, and sadly their best league finish was third place in 1998.

===The 2000s===
Rangers topped the table after the 2001 home and away season but finished bottom of the four-team championship playoff group.

Enugu Rangers made the group stage of the 2004 CAF Confederation Cup and missed out on winning the group and making the final after losing a head-to-head tiebreaker to Asante Kotoko. Rangers drew 0–0 against Angola&#x27;s Petro de Luanda and celebrated, thinking they had advanced on goal difference, but the first tiebreaker was head-to-head.

In the 2005 season, Rangers finished as Runners-up in the league, five points off eventual champions Enyimba.

In 2008–09, they played some games in nearby Abakaliki and Nnewi as their stadium was renovated for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Before the season started, Enugu State governor Sullivan Chime paid the backlog of sign-on fees dating to three years ago and all other debts owed the players.

In November 2008, Rangers became the first Nigerian club side to be a public company and sell ownership stock. However the deal fell through, and the club began the 2009 season in debt. The club is currently owned by the state government.

Enugu did begin a 12-year run of success in a minor trophy, the local state FA Cup, which they won every year from 2005 to 2017.

===2016–current: Success again===
After a 2015 season which nearly saw them relegated, Enugu won the 2016 Nigeria Premier League, their first championship since 1982. Their closest challengers Rivers United needed Enugu to lose on the final day of the season, but Rangers won their game against El-Kanemi Warriors 4–0 to win the championship.

2017 saw Enugu struggle, dropping into the relegation zone halfway through the season. They recovered, finishing 14th and keeping alive their record of never being relegated from the top flight.

The club went on to win their first Nigerian Cup in 35 years in 2018. Rangers stunned Kano Pillars, coming back from a 3–0 deficit to win the trophy on penalties. Ajani Ibrahim scored on a diving header two minutes into stoppage time to tie the game 3–3. Rangers played in the final five times from 1987 to 2007, never winning once.

In the first championship playoff clash on Wednesday, June 13, 2019, Enugu Rangers defeated FC IfeanyiUbah 4–2 in a six-goal thriller to secure a CAF Confederation Cup ticket.

Many Nigerians remember with fondness watching Enugu Rangers play in the 1970s and 1980s.

On matchday 35 of the 2023-24 edition of the NPFL, 44,000 people showed up for a game between Rangers International and rivals Enyimba FC at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, the best-attended match in the NPFL during that football season. On 16th June 2024 under coach Fidelis Ilechukwu, Rangers won the 2023/2024 NPFL championship title after defeating Bendel Insurance by 2-0 with a game to play, this extended their league title wins to 8. Their success has been extended to other national trophies and championship. They have won 5 times between the year 1974 - 1983.

==Rivalries==
Enyimba and Rangers compete in the &quot;Oriental derby.&quot; It will be the first time Enugu Rangers Coach Ogunbote Gbenga who was in charge of Eyinmba last season will be facing his former Club this season.

<text>Haarlem oil (), also called medicamentum gratia probatum, is a dietary supplement. The potion is a mixture of sulfur, herbs and terebinth oil. It is produced in Haarlem, Netherlands.

It was invented in 1696 by Claes Tilly and was marketed as a cure for many ailments.

The word &quot;haarlemmerolie&quot; (with a lowercase &#x27;h&#x27;) is now used in Dutch to indicate a fix for all problems. For example: &quot;lowering taxes will be like haarlemmerolie for the economy&quot;. This is also used sarcastically.

Benefits to race horses -
- Greatly improves the urinary system and removes most toxins in the horse&#x27;s system.

- Haarlem oil guarantees against infections, such as respiratory, urinary, biliary, and intestinal.

- Naturally stimulates the horse&#x27;s own hormone secretions without side effects.

- Helps assist the rapid recovery process after the horse competes.

- Fights any and all arthritic actions.

<doc id="999817" wikidata="Q42190" url="?curid=999817" title=".cc">
<text>On the Internet, .cc is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an Australian territory. 

== Management ==
It is administered by a United States company, VeriSign, through a subsidiary company, eNIC, which promotes it for international registration as &quot;the next .com&quot;. 

The .cc domain was originally assigned to eNIC in October 1997 by the IANA; eNIC manages the TLD alongside SamsDirect Internet.

== Registration ==
Registration is made directly at second-level.

=== Second level domains ===

=== gov.cu.cc, com.cc, net.cc, edu.cc, org.cc===
A number of second-level domain names are also maintained by CoCCA, including &quot;com.cc&quot;, &quot;net.cc&quot;, &quot;edu.cc&quot;, and &quot;org.cc&quot;.

===cc.cc, co.cc, cu.cc, cz.cc===
These are not official hierarchies of .cc, but domains owned by companies who offer free subdomain registration.

=== co.cc ===
The co.cc URL has been known to host spammers, who create spam blogs, or &quot;splogs&quot;, often with nonsense names. 

Due to such spamming, in July 2011 Google removed over 11 million .co.cc websites from its search results. 

Legitimate sites (per Google&#x27;s Webmaster Guidelines) on the .co.cc subdomain could send a reconsideration request to Google to have their specific site excluded from the ban.

The abundance of cheap .co.cc domains had also been used by those who sold fake &quot;anti-virus&quot; programs.

From 2012 to 2014, the co.cc website and name servers were not online. There was no formal statement by the company, but they did stop accepting new registrations some time before they closed.

In 2018, co.cc was listed for sale for US$500,000.00. As of 2019, co.cc is registered to and in use by another entity.

== Usage ==
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus also uses the .cc domain, along with .nc.tr. 

Google treats .cc as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted.&quot;

The TLD is preferred by many cricket and cycling clubs, as well as churches and Christian organizations, since &quot;CC&quot; can be an abbreviation for &quot;Christian Church&quot; or &quot;Catholic Church&quot;. 

Some open-source/open-hardware projects, such as the Arduino project, use a .cc for their home pages, since &quot;CC&quot; is also the abbreviation for &quot;Creative Commons&quot;, whose licenses are used in the projects. 

Business owners in Southern Massachusetts are rapidly adopting Cape Cod CC domains for local identity. Canadian Club whiskey has also used .cc domains for marketing purposes. 

It is also used for some community colleges, though other domains, such as .edu, are more popular.

== Issues ==
In 2016, the Anti-Phishing Working Group stated that the .cc, .com, .pw, and .tk domain names account for 75% of all malicious domain registrations.

<doc id="999820" wikidata="Q1865962" url="?curid=999820" title="Littrow (crater)">
<text>Littrow is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, on the east edge of Mare Serenitatis. Its diameter is 29 km. The crater is named after Bohemian astronomer Joseph Johann von Littrow (1781–1840). Some distance to the northeast is the prominent crater Römer, while to the south is Vitruvius.

The rim of Littrow is heavily worn and eroded, especially along the southern wall. The interior has been flooded with lava in the past, leaving a relatively smooth, featureless surface with no central rise.

==Rimae Littrow==
Just to the northwest of Littrow is a system of rilles designated the Rimae Littrow. These are located at selenographic coordinates 22.1° N, 29.9° E, and have a maximum diameter of 115 km. To the south-southwest is the Taurus–Littrow valley that is notable for being the landing site of the Apollo 17 mission.

Part of Rimae Littrow (northwest of the crater Clerke) was considered for a landing site of an early Apollo mission, primarily because the mare materials in the area are anomalously dark, and also because there are abundant wrinkle ridges in the area. The site would have been the landing site of Apollo 14 had Apollo 13 suceeeded in landing in the Fra Mauro formation lunar highlands. Apollo 14 was redirected there following the failure of Apollo 13 to make a lunar landing.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Littrow.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Littrow B — &quot;See&quot; Clerke (crater).

== Catena Littrow ==
There is a (crater chain), named after crater Littrow.

<text>Manilius is a lunar impact crater on the northeast edge of Mare Vaporum. Its diameter is 38 km.

==Description==
Manilius has a well-defined rim with a sloping inner surface that runs directly down to the ring-shaped mound of scree along the base, and a small outer . The small crater interior has a higher albedo than the surroundings, and it appears bright when the sun is overhead. Within the crater is a central peak formation near the midpoint.

The crater also possesses a ray system that extends for a distance of over 300 kilometers. Despite the presence of these rays, which generally indicate the age of the crater as Copernican, the crater is currently mapped as Eratosthenian age.

==Names==
Manilius is named after the Roman astronomer Marcus Manilius. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Isabellae Reg. Hisp.&quot; (Isabella, Queen of Spain), and Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Insula Besbicus&quot; after the island in Turkey now known as İmralı.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Manilius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Manilius A — &quot;See&quot; Bowen.
* Manilius F — &quot;See&quot; Yangel&#x27;.

<doc id="999843" wikidata="Q3201692" url="?curid=999843" title="The Neutronium Alchemist">
<text>The Neutronium Alchemist is a science fiction novel by British writer Peter F. Hamilton, the second book in &quot;The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy&quot;. It follows on from &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; and precedes &quot;The Naked God&quot;. It was published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 20 October 1997. The first United States edition, which is broken into two volumes, &quot;Consolidation&quot; and &quot;Conflict&quot;, followed in April and May 1998 from Time Warner Books. The second US edition, as a single volume, was published in December 2008 by Orbit Books. This novel, along with others in the series, is noted for its length (more than 1,000 pages long in paperback) and technological depth.

==Background==

In &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot;, the presence of an energy-based alien lifeform during the death of a human on the colony world of Lalonde somehow &#x27;jammed open&#x27; the interface between this universe and &#x27;the beyond&#x27;, an energistic vacuum where the souls of dead humans (and possibly other races) have become trapped after death. They are able to cross back over into this universe and possess the living, gaining tremendous strength, agility and the ability to create and alter matter. They overrun the planet Lalonde in a matter of weeks and spread beyond to the planets Atlantis and Norfolk and to the independent habitat Valisk, among others. The Kulu Kingdom colony world of Ombey is also infiltrated and a veteran of the Lalonde fiasco, Ralph Hiltch, is drafted in to help contain the menace. At the end of &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; the truth of the nature of the threat is discovered by several survivors of a botched attempt to rescue the situation on Lalonde. However, a second threat has also emerged. Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of the feared &#x27;Alchemist&#x27; weapon of mass destruction, has escaped from Tranquillity and apparently seeks revenge on Omuta, the world that destroyed her own home planet of Garissa thirty years earlier.

==Plot summary==
The voidhawk &quot;Oenone&quot; reaches Jupiter and docks with one of the 4,250 habitats orbiting the planet. Whilst medical assistance and trauma counselling begin to help heal Syrinx, the information from Laton and the events on Atlantis is transmitted to the Jovian Consensus. As they become aware of the scale of the crisis, the Edenists immediately switch their economy to a war footing, rendering Jupiter space impregnable to attack. They also develop personality-query systems which should render all Edenists, voidhawks and habitats immune to possession. They detach a quarter of the voidhawk fleet and assign it to reinforce the Confederation Navy. Admiral Aleksandrovich summons an emergency session of the Confederation Assembly on its meeting world of Avon.

On Avon the Confederation Assembly is stunned to learn of the threat from the possessed. The Confederation Navy shuts down all interstellar flights to contain the threat and goes to its highest state of alert. In a startling move, the Tyrathca immediately cut themselves off from all contact with humanity for the duration of the crisis. The Kiint ambassador reveals that, many thousands of years ago, they also suffered a &#x27;possession crisis&#x27;, as the secret of death is one that is eventually discovered by all sentient races. They claim that their solution to the crisis is not applicable to humanity, who must find their own way.

Alkad Mzu departs from the blackhawk &quot;Udat&quot;, leaving behind a virus in its jump system which causes the destruction of &quot;Udat&quot; whilst making a wormhole transit. She does this both to protect knowledge of her whereabouts and also as revenge: &quot;Udat&quot; was one of the blackhawks which crippled the &quot;Beezling&quot; just before the Garissan Genocide.

On the planet Norfolk, the possessed succeed in over-running most of the planet. Louise Kavanagh&#x27;s father, Grant, is possessed and gives up his home estate to forces loyal to Quinn Dexter. However, Dexter&#x27;s attempts to have Louise and her sister Genevieve possessed are thwarted by another possessed, who assists Louise and Genevieve in reaching the nearest aerodrome. He reveals his name – Fletcher Christian – and vows to protect them from those who mean them harm. He bemoans the lack of chivalry and honour among his fellow returnees. They flee to the capital, which is in danger of falling, and briefly find refuge with Louise&#x27;s cousins, the Hewsons. One of the cousins, Roberto, attempts to rape Louise, but fortunately is thwarted. After this, with her parents declared missing, Louise takes control of the Kavanagh fortune and is able to use this to book passage on a starship fleeing the system for Earth. They end up on a ship owned by SII (Mars&#x27; national company) and eventually reach High York, an asteroid in the O&#x27;Neill Halo in orbit above Earth. Christian&#x27;s true nature is detected and he, Louise and Genevieve are all arrested.

On Ombey Ralph Hiltch assists the local police and military in tracking down the possessed from Lalonde. Princess Kirsten authorises the use of lethal force and, in a move which establishes a precedent across the Confederation, the planet&#x27;s own strategic defence platforms are turned against the possessed, destroying an aircraft and several buses carrying them. One bus manages to get onto Mortonridge, a hilly peninsula, and the entire human population of nearly two million is possessed. SD platforms and the military manage to seal off the peninsula, containing the possessed in this one area. The leader of the possessed, Annette Ekelund, agrees to a cessation of hostilities until a more permanent solution to the crisis is found. However, the Kulu Kingdom is unwilling to look inactive whilst its citizens are in danger, and contingency plans are made. Hiltch visits Kulu itself and is shocked to learn that there was an outbreak of possession in Nova Kong, the capital, but it was put down hard by the authorities. King Alastair agrees to authorise an alliance with the Edenists, who will provide bitek soldiers to help retake Mortonridge. They know now that the possessed fear zero-tau and plan to use thousands of zero-tau pods to force the possessed to give up their bodies. The campaign will likely be bloody, but the Confederation badly needs a victory.

Joshua Calvert and the crew of the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot; return to Tranquillity with news of events on Lalonde. Kelly Tirrel becomes an overnight celebrity for her reports of the conflict on Lalonde, and the children rescued from the planet are well-treated in the habitat&#x27;s children&#x27;s home. Ione asks Joshua Calvert to take his ship and pursue Alkad Mzu and &quot;Udat&quot; wherever they have gone. Ione believes that the Alchemist may pose as great a threat as the possessed. Joshua reluctantly agrees. Before he departs, Father Horst Elwes relates to him a story about how he was able to &#x27;exorcise&#x27; a possessing spirit on Lalonde and tells Joshua to have faith.

On New California a few possessed manage to get loose on the planet, but they are disorganised and unable to make much headway. One of the possessed appears to be a raving lunatic, but as the days pass the possessing soul&#x27;s presence in a normally-functioning brain restore his sanity and his memory. The possessing soul turns out to be Al Capone, a famed gangster from 20th century Chicago. Capone organises the possessed and they take over the planet in a matter of weeks. Capone realises they need to keep the planet&#x27;s economy and starship-building capability going to defend themselves from any counter-attack, so many citizens are spared from possession (the act of which interferes with electrical systems nearby) as long as they contribute to the expansion of Capone&#x27;s &#x27;Organisation&#x27;. The interstellar superstar Jezebelle (a singer and &#x27;mood-fantasy&#x27; artist) is on the planet at the time and she rapidly becomes Capone&#x27;s lover, but also proves to be a valuable source of intelligence on the Confederation. The Organisation spreads to another planet and its ships begin causing problems for the Confederation Navy. First Admiral Samual Aleksandrovich learns that the Organisation&#x27;s next conquest will be the planet Toi Hoi and develops a plan to intercept and destroy their fleet there.

Quinn Dexter leaves Norfolk and travels to Earth, hoping to infiltrate the arcologies there. However, Earth&#x27;s defences and security measures are far too strong for him to penetrate. He instead travels to a planet called Nyvan, one of the earliest colonies founded before the policy of ethnic-streaming colonies came into effect. As a result, the planet is locked in a permanent state of cold war. Dexter effectively takes over one of the orbital asteroids. During his conquest he discovers it is possible to shift his body into a &#x27;ghost realm&#x27;, where he finds more dead souls. They claim that when someone dies only some are trapped in a beyond, whilst others become locked in a ghost-like state. Although he has no use for the ghosts, Dexter realises he can use this new ability to break through Earth&#x27;s security again.

In the Valisk habitat, the possessed, aided by Dariat, become organised and swiftly take over much of the habitat. Rubra, the personality controlling the habitat, tries to reason with Dariat to little avail. Kiera, the leader of the possessed on Valisk (and the possessor of Marie Skibbow), travels to New California and is able to secure an alliance with the Organisation. Thanks to Dariat&#x27;s knowledge of bitek systems, he is able to arrange for several dozen blackhawks to be possessed. The resulting &#x27;hellhawks&#x27; become a valuable asset and Kiera is able to sell their skills to the Organisation. However, Dariat becomes gradually opposed to the possessed, due to their brutal tactics and penchant for destruction. He decides to side with Rubra, helps some of the non-possessed population to evacuate, and then merges his personality with Rubra&#x27;s in the neural strata. The resulting blast of energy ends the threat of the possessed but also rips Valisk out of the material universe and into a strange realm of grey mists. Dariat is horrified to wake up and discover that he is now a ghost.

At Jupiter, Syrinx recovers from her injuries. She visits Eden, the original habitat, where the personality of Wing-Tsit Chong, Edenism&#x27;s founder, lives on in the habitat&#x27;s neural strata. With his guidance, Syrinx is able to overcome both the trauma of her experience and also her prejudice against Adamists. Syrinx and &quot;Oenone&quot; begin flying again and are assigned to a Confederation Navy squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Meredith Saldana, which is assigned to the upcoming Toi Hoi interception mission. Saldana&#x27;s squadron travels to Tranquillity, where Ione Saldana agrees – reluctantly – to let them use the habitat as a staging ground for the attack.

On Trafalgar, the Confederation Navy HQ asteroid orbiting Avon, a possessed prisoner demands a hearing to confirm her human rights and stop the Navy personnel running tests on her. However, she nearly escapes during the hearing and manages to have several other people possessed, one of whom has knowledge of the Toi Hoi operation. She re-kills this individual, and then surrenders to the staff.

At New California the possessing soul from Trafalgar manages to get reincarnated and warns Capone of the Toi Hoi ambush. Capone prepares his own plan in response.

In Tranquillity the Kiint researchers at the Ruin Ring project become intrigued by reports reaching them about a Tyrathca religion they previously did not know about (when one of the children from Lalonde tells a Kiint youth about it). They acquire the relevant data about the Sleeping God from Kelly Tirrel. Tranquillity observes this and Tirrel gives Ione a copy of the data. Ione is puzzled – the Tyrathca are a notably unimaginative species and have no need for supernatural deities – but her advisors suggest that the Sleeping God is actually a real entity who was able to aid the Tyrathca centuries ago, and may be able to aid humanity now against the threat of the possessed.

Joshua Calvert&#x27;s hunt for Mzu and the Alchemist takes him to several worlds and asteroid settlements. On Ayachuko asteroid, in the Dorados, he is shocked to discover that he has a half-brother, Liol, the result of a liaison between Joshua&#x27;s father Marcus and a local woman nearly thirty years ago. With possessed loosed on Ayachucko, Joshua agrees to let Liol depart with them. Joshua is attacked by a possessed but his attempt to &#x27;exorcise&#x27; him as per Elwes&#x27; instruction fails, apparently because the possessing spirit was a Sunni Muslim and has no fear of Joshua&#x27;s crucifix. Joshua and his crew manage to escape. Mzu&#x27;s trail leads them to Nyvan. Joshua&#x27;s pursuit is hampered by agents from the Edenist Intelligence service (led by Samual) and the Kulu External Security Agency (led by Monica Foulkes) who have surprisingly joined forces in their own pursuit of Mzu. Possessed loosed on Nyvan have also learned of Mzu&#x27;s weapon and are searching for her. The pursuit culminates in a showdown at an iron yard. Joshua and his companions survive thanks to the intervention of a man with strange abilities named Dick Keaton, and are able to extract Mzu safely, although they also have to pick up Monica and Samual. Dexter destroys an orbital asteroid with nuclear bombs, causing a rain of asteroid chunks to fall on and annihilate the planet&#x27;s biosphere. Satisfied with the chaos he has caused, Dexter departs for Earth. He abandons his comrades, slips into the ghost realm to evade security, and reappears in the space elevator descending towards the planet.

Safely aboard Joshua&#x27;s ship Mzu explains how thirty years ago she and other Garrisan starships were on a mission to deploy the Alchemist when they were ambushed and left for dead by Omutan hired blackhawks (as portrayed in the first chapter of &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot;). They were left with two badly damaged ships, one with an active ZTT drive and the other without. With a difficult decision ahead, they decided to place 30 crewmembers in zero-tau and the Alchemist on the damaged Beezling, and send them to the nearest uninhabited star two and a half light-years away at sub-light speed (9% the speed of light due to the lack of a ZTT drive), what would be a 28-year journey. Mzu and others escaped via ZTT jump on the remaining ship with the intentions of rendezvousing with the Beezling upon its arrival in 28 years.

Mzu finally reveals the location coordinates of the uninhabited star that the Beezling is now orbiting and Joshua and his crew race to the star with the intentions of intercepting and destroying the Alchemist. Upon their arrival they discover the Alchemist and the Beezling with most of its crew intact. During the rescue Joshua&#x27;s ship is ambushed by two Organization hellhawks that pursued them from Nyvan. Finding himself greatly outmaneuvered, Joshua pulls off a daring stunt by deploying the Alchemist into a nearby gas giant causing it to go nova, destroying the two Organization ships. Joshua meanwhile uses his ship&#x27;s anti-matter drive to safely accelerate away from the nova at forty-two gees to a distance where they can make a proper ZTT jump.

With knowledge of the Confederation&#x27;s Toi Hoi assault fleet grouping and refuelling at Tranquility, the Organisation fleet, aided by a large number of hellhawks, stages a massive assault on Tranquillity, surrounding the habitat and its few blackhawk mercenary and Confederation Navy defenders. They demand Tranquillity&#x27;s immediate surrender. When Ione hesitates, they launch over 5,000 anti-matter weapons at the habitat.

Later, when &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; arrives at Mirchusko, they find a vast radioactive dead zone where Tranquillity used to be. However, there is insufficient debris or disintegrated matter in orbit to suggest the station was destroyed. Its fate is unknown.

The story concludes in &quot;The Naked God&quot;.

== Notes ==
This novel features two appearances by actual historical figures among the possessed. Fletcher Christian, who led the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, and 1930s American gangster Al Capone, both have prominent storylines. There is also a comedic interlude between two men both claiming to be Elvis Presley, although the implication is that both are merely Elvis impersonators.

Two lengthy subplots were cut from the novel. Taking place on Srinagar, the Hindu-ethnic planet in the same system as Valisk, this would have had an army of possessed conquering the planet with bitek constructs. The second plot would have involved Louise and Genevieve&#x27;s ship crash-landing on Mars. Both plots were dropped for space reasons.

<text>Samuel Zachary Arkoff (June 12, 1918 – September 16, 2001) was an American film producer, known as the co-founder of American International Pictures.

== Life and career ==
Arkoff was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa, to Russian Jewish parents. He was the son of Helen (Lurie) and Louis Arkoff, who ran his Louis Clothing Co. Arkoff first studied to be a lawyer. He began his career in Hollywood as a producer of &quot;The Hank McCune Show&quot;, a seminal sitcom produced in 1951.

In 1954, James H. Nicholson founded the American Releasing Corporation, which later became known as American International Pictures, and made Arkoff the vice-president. AIP films were mostly low-budget, with production completed in a few days, though nearly all of them became profitable. Along with business partner James H. Nicholson and producer-director Roger Corman, he produced eighteen films.

Arkoff is also credited with starting a few genres, such as the &quot;Beach Party&quot; and outlaw biker movies, and his company played a substantial part in bringing the horror film genre to a novel level with successes such as &quot;Blacula&quot;, &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; and &quot;The Thing with Two Heads&quot;. American International Pictures movies starred many established actors in principal or cameo roles, such as Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Peter Lorre, and Vincent Price, as well as others who later became household names, including Don Johnson, Nick Nolte, Diane Ladd, and most notably Jack Nicholson. A number of actors shunned or overlooked by most of Hollywood during the 1960s and 1970s, such as Bruce Dern and Dennis Hopper, also found work in one or more of Arkoff&#x27;s productions. Arkoff&#x27;s most financially successful film was the 1979 adaptation of Jay Anson&#x27;s book &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;.

Following the sale of AIP to Filmways in 1979 for $30 million, Arkoff was unhappy with the direction of the company and resigned in December 1979 to set up his own production company, Arkoff International Pictures., receiving a payout worth $1.4 million.

Arkoff&#x27;s 1992 autobiography was titled &quot;Flying Through Hollywood by the Seat of my Pants: From the Man who Brought You I was a Teenage Werewolf and Muscle Beach Party&quot;.

In 2000, Arkoff was featured alongside former collaborators including Roger Corman, Dick Miller and Peter Bogdanovich in the documentary &quot;SCHLOCK! The Secret History of American Movies&quot;, a film about the rise and fall of American exploitation cinema.

== Personal life and death ==
He was married to Hilda Rusoff until her death in July 2001. They had two children: Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Arkoff, who was also his producing partner; and Donna Roth, who is a movie producer married to the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios Joe Roth. He also had five grandchildren and a great-grandson.

Arkoff died in Burbank, California, on September 16, 2001, at the age of 83.

== The &quot;ARKOFF Formula&quot; ==
During a 1980s television talk show appearance, Arkoff shared with viewers his &quot;ARKOFF Formula&quot; for making successful, memorable films. The formula—or, more accurately, the checklist—forms an acronym of his surname, and it identifies the content elements that should be considered and included in a movie, especially in a low-budget production:

* Action (exciting, entertaining drama)
* Revolution (novel or controversial themes and ideas)
* Killing (a modicum of violence)
* Oratory (notable dialogue and speeches)
* Fantasy (acted-out fantasies common to the audience)
* Fornication (sex appeal, for young adults)

<doc id="999846" wikidata="Q3222317" url="?curid=999846" title="The Naked God">
<text>The Naked God is a science fiction novel by British writer Peter F. Hamilton, the third book in &quot;The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy&quot;, following on from &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; and &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist&quot;. It was published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 8 October 1999. This was the first novel by Hamilton to be published in hardcover in the United States, on 22 October 1999. As with the first two volumes, the US paperback was split into two volumes, entitled &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;, published in November and December 2000. In February 2009 Orbit Books issued the first one-volume paperback edition of the novel in the US.

Even by the standards of the first two books, &quot;The Naked God&quot; is an extremely large volume. It was only possible to publish the UK paperback in one volume by moderately decreasing the font size compared to the previous novels.

Although the final novel so far in the Night&#x27;s Dawn Universe (a &#x27;guidebook&#x27; to the setting, &quot;The Confederation Handbook&quot;, was later published), Hamilton has occasionally hinted at returning to the setting in future books in the form of a sequel series set up to 500 years after the events in the trilogy.

== Background ==

In &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot;, the presence of an energy-based alien lifeform during the death of a human on the colony world of Lalonde somehow &#x27;jammed open&#x27; the interface between this universe and &#x27;the beyond&#x27;, an energistic vacuum where the souls of dead humans (and other races, although they inhabit different areas within that realm) have become trapped after death. They are able to cross back over into this universe and possess the living, gaining tremendous strength, agility and the ability to create and alter matter. They overrun the planet Lalonde in a matter of weeks and spread beyond to many other worlds and asteroid settlements. A failed attempt to conquer the planet Atlantis alerts the Edenists to the threat.

In &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist&quot;, the Confederation learns of the extent of the danger and imposes a complete shut-down of all interstellar flight to quarantine the possessed on the few planets they have secured a foothold on. However, quarantine-busting flights soon spread the possessed further. The deployment of military forces against the possessed is complicated by the fact that killing the possessor also kills the possessed victim. This depressing fact, creating the greatest hostage situation in human history, threatens to undermine morale. Eventually, the Kulu Kingdom joins forces with their ideological opponents, the Edenists, to retake the peninsula of Mortonridge on their colony world of Ombey from the possessed to provide the Confederation with proof that the possessed can be beaten. Elsewhere, the most infamous &#x27;returnee&#x27; of the possessed, Al Capone, uses his organisational skills to conquer the planet New California and turn it into the hub of an expanding empire, &#x27;The Organisation&#x27;, with the Confederation Navy hard-pressed to deal with checking its advance whilst maintaining the quarantine.

At the conclusion of &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist&quot;, the personnel of Tranquillity learned that over a thousand years ago a Tyrathca arkship encountered a space-borne entity known as the &#x27;Sleeping God&#x27; which exhibited enormous powers which may be of use against the possessed. Before this information could be passed onto anyone, the habitat came under concerted attack by the Organisation. When Captain Calvert and the crew of the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot; arrived back at Tranquillity, they found the habitat missing, presumed possessed and taken out of the universe.

== Plot summary ==

Jay Hilton, one of the surviving children from Lalonde, is awoken when Tranquillity falls under attack by the Organisation and its hellhawk allies. With the habitat in imminent danger of destruction, the Kiint personnel immediately evacuate by triggering their &#x27;Emergency Exodus Facility&#x27;, personal wormholes that transport them to the real Kiint home star system. An infant Kiint, Haile, decides that she cannot let Jay be killed in the attack and activates the Emergency Exodus Facility on her, removing her from Tranquillity as well, to the displeasure of her parents, Nang and Lieria. Jay finds herself on a planet which appears to be just one in a necklace of hundreds orbiting a star in the same orbit. Haile&#x27;s parents reluctantly confirm that this, the Kiint home system, is actually in another galaxy, and the supposed Kiint homeworld of Jobis was actually just a single scientific outpost. They regretfully announce that Tranquillity has either been destroyed or forced to surrender to the possessed.

The Jovian Consensus is placed on an emergency alert when a colossal wormhole opens above Jupiter. They are shocked when the habitat Tranquillity appears. Ione Saldana reveals that Michael Saldana feared that whatever destroyed the Laymil might return to its system, and gave Tranquillity the means to escape that threat.

The &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; journeys to Trafalgar and there reveal the events of their mission to the First Admiral, who is happy that the Alchemist has been destroyed and Alkad Mzu is no longer at large. Because Joshua Calvert knows the mechanics of the Alchemist he must not risk death due to the event his soul is brought back in a different body and is tortured/interrogated by the possessed about his knowledge of the Alchemist. After thoroughly debriefing the crew, the First Admiral allows them to travel on to Tranquillity. A meeting is held and Ione proposes that Tranquillity and the Jovian Consensus join forces to track down the Tyrathca Sleeping God and see what use it could be in the fight with the possessed. Syrinx and the voidhawk &quot;Oenone&quot; volunteer for the mission and Joshua Calvert agrees to take the &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; on the mission. The Confederation Navy and the Kulu ESA also agree to support the venture. Because the mission will involve travelling several thousand light-years far outside Confederation territory, &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; is authorised to use antimatter on this mission. The Confederation Navy has located the antimatter production facility that is fuelling Capone&#x27;s Organisation. They allow &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; to fuel up and then destroy it. The Organisation hellhawk &quot;Stryla&quot; observes the attack and notes that the &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; jumped to the Tyrathca prime colony world in Confederation space, and delivers that information to the Organisation. Several Organisation ships are despatched to pursue and investigate.

On Ombey, the Liberation Campaign begins with a massive assault on Mortonridge by tens of thousands of regular troops and Edenist bitek soldiers. Although the campaign is costly, ground is won and thousands of the possessed are forcibly ejected from their hosts. Eventually the possessed fall back on a small patch of land at the tip of the peninsula and by combining their energistic powers are able to teleport the entire patch of land into a strange grey realm. The possessed and the attacking soldiers agree to a truce until they can work out how to survive in this strange place.

The Valisk habitat is trapped in yet another realm, nicknamed &quot;the dark continuum&quot;. Energistic power is weak in this place, and entropic decay is far more powerful than normal. As a result, Valisk&#x27;s energy is being lost into the &#x27;dark continuum&#x27;, as it has been named. Even worse, what energy it does manage to generate attracts the attention of monstrous, immortal, shape-shifting predators known as Orgathé, who attack the habitat with enthusiasm to feed on its power. There is a gravitational incline in this dimension which leads to a horrifying place called the Mélange, a liquid nitrogen–cold sea of beings trapped in this continuum, unable to accumulate enough energy to escape. Dariat escapes from Valisk in an escape pod with Tolton before it hits the Mélange and explodes, but they ponder that it is only a matter of time until the pod runs out of fuel and dissolves, forcing them to join the tortured beings outside.

The Confederation Navy research team discovers a possible way of killing the possessed, an &#x27;anti-memory&#x27; device that will eradicate both the possessed and the possessing soul. The First Admiral is horrified about the weapon and even more horrified when President Haakar, panicking as the possession crisis spreads to more worlds, authorises its development. The scientists hope to create a more powerful version that will obliterate all of the tens of billions of souls in the beyond, which becomes a controversial idea among the Confederation government. Although the first weapon is completed, further research is suspended when a lone Organisation suicide attacker detonates an antimatter bomb right outside the habitat, irradiating it and destroying dozens of ships outside. The internal staff survive, but have to transfer their personnel and equipment to Avon. Furious, the First Admiral orders that the Organisation be permanently eradicated.

A fleet of over a thousand Confederation warships mobilises and attacks the worlds the Organisation have conquered, forcing them to withdraw back to New California. The other worlds, freed from the need to supply the Organisation with materials, are shifted out of the universe by their possessed populations.

Joshua Calvert and Syrinx begin their search for the Sleeping God by visiting the only known Tyrathca planet in the Confederation, breaking into the abandoned arkship in orbit around the planet, to determine the origin of the Tyrathca, whose original home planet appears to be on the far side of the Orion Nebula. On the way, however, the Tyrathca break into the arkship as well and pursue the expeditionary team, who also find evidence in the arkship&#x27;s systems of prior use by the Kiint. The humans manage to escape by duplicating the manoeuvre of the blackhawk &quot;Udat&quot;, swallowing into a hollow chamber in the arkship and swallowing out again to extricate the expeditionary team.

On Earth, Louise Kavanagh returns to London after warning Banneth of Quinn Dexter&#x27;s intention of killing her. It is eventually revealed that Quinn&#x27;s actions had been discovered by a secret Govcentral security council named B7. They are in contact with Banneth and attempt to use her as bait, to lure Dexter out of hiding and then hit the building he is in with an orbital gamma laser. Quinn sees through their trap though, and arranges for a double of himself to be in the building while it is destroyed, thereby killing Banneth and the double, and making B7 think he is dead. His plan is foiled, though, by a person calling himself &quot;a friend of Carter McBride&quot; (the boy Laton killed to expose Quinn&#x27;s cult on Lalonde), and B7 is once again on Quinn&#x27;s tracks. Louise is summoned by a member of B7, the Western Europe Supervisor. He reveals to her the truth about B7: it is a consortium of incredibly wealthy individuals whose &quot;financial institutions own a healthy percentage of the human race&quot;. They believe themselves to be immortal, as they use affinity to transfer their memories and personality into clone bodies to avoid death, in much the same way as Edenists (although the Kiint reveal that souls are different from &quot;memory constructs&quot;, and that therefore they actually died every time their old bodies were destroyed, with their souls moving on). He also reveals that they were the actual cause behind the schism between Adamists and Edenists, which began as their attempt to keep bitek technology all for themselves (a plan that was foiled when Wing-Tsit Chong created Edenism). He arranges for Louise to meet up with Fletcher Christian in London. From there they would find Dexter and use the anti-memory device to kill him forever. The operation fails, and Louise finally confronts Quinn at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, where he attempts to bring the Night to the Universe by opening a dimensional rift to summon &quot;fallen angels&quot; to Earth. The first creatures to emerge from it are none other than Dariat and Tolton (as the rift turns out to lead directly into the Mélange). A confrontation ensues, with Louise, Fletcher, Dariat, Tolton, and a returned-from-the-beyond Powel Manani (the friend of Carter McBride) faced off against the army of the possessed and the entities fleeing the Mélange.

The &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Oenone&quot; continue on to the Tyrathca home system, now swallowed by a red giant. At first they believe the system is uninhabited, until they catch sight of dozens of habitats ringing the Red Giant. They contact the nearest and make contact with the Mosdva, who turn out to have once been the Tyrathca&#x27;s slaves, being used to mine and build the ships and habitats since they were more versatile in zero gravity. The &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;″s arrival leads to a war breaking out amongst the dominions on the habitat, which ends when they gain a Tyrathca star map, and give the dominions their FTL technology. After a lengthy journey they find the &quot;Sleeping God&quot;, a naked singularity supplied by controlling vacuum energy. The Sleeping God was originally created to remove its creator race from the current universe, and was built to help sentient entities. It reveals, among other things, that souls remain trapped in the beyond because they are unable to accept their death; all souls are indeed destined for the Beyond, but those that let go travel through the time of the spaceless dimension to the &quot;omega point&quot;, the end of the Universe where all souls combine into one and contribute to the nature of the next universe to be born. Joshua Calvert uses the god to return every stolen Confederation planet to the Universe, before moving them out of the Galaxy, altering the wormholes to remove the possessed. He also makes Quinn into a vessel for all of the human souls in the beyond, to transport them all to the Omega point instead of letting them suffer in eternal purgatory. He then gives himself affinity and returns to Tranquility, marries young girl Louise and settles down to live on Norfolk.

Numerous plot strands are also tied up in the closing pages, revealing Dariat&#x27;s reunion with Anastasia in some unknown realm, the fate of the members of B7 and Andre Duchamp (who Joshua ironically strands on a penal planet), Ralph Hiltch&#x27;s &#x27;conversion&#x27; to Edenism, Syrinx reawakening Erik Thakrar, and the settling of the Hiltons on Norfolk.

<text>Ensiferum (Latin: , n adj., meaning &quot;sword bearing&quot;) is a Finnish folk metal band from Helsinki. The members of the band label themselves as &quot;melodic folk metal&quot;.

==History==
===Formation, demos and &quot;Ensiferum&quot; (1995−2002)===
&quot;Ensiferum&quot; was founded in 1995 by Markus Toivonen (guitar), Sauli Savolainen (bass) and Kimmo Miettinen (drums). In the next year, Jari Mäenpää was taken into the band as singer and second guitar-player. In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs.


In 1998, Savolainen and Miettinen left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo Miettinen&#x27;s little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band&#x27;s confidence. In November 1999 a third demo &quot;Hero in a Dream&quot; was recorded, and was successful in obtaining a record deal with Spinefarm Records. The logo that appears on all the band&#x27;s releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos. In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, &quot;Ensiferum&quot;, which was released in July 2001. In the same year, Meiju Enho joined them as a keyboard-player.

===&quot;Iron&quot;, Line-up changes, &quot;Dragonheads&quot; and &quot;10th Anniversary Live&quot; (2003−2006)===
In early 2004, after the work was completed on the second album, &quot;Iron&quot;, Mäenpää was fired from the band due to conflicts between scheduled studio work on his side project Wintersun and touring with Ensiferum. For the tour with Finntroll starting in April, Petri Lindroos from Norther replaced Mäenpää on guitar and as singer, and became a member of the band after the tour. In December 2004, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen left the band and was replaced by Sami Hinkka (Rapture). Fokin also left in 2005 to be replaced by Janne Parviainen.

The new Ensiferum line-up entered the studio later that year to record an EP to be called &quot;Dragonheads&quot;, which was released in February 2006. As well as the title track, it also contained two reworked demo songs; an Amorphis cover and a short rendition of the Kalevala melody, as well as a medley of three traditional Finnish songs.

In June 2006, Ensiferum released their live DVD, &quot;10th Anniversary Live&quot;, which was recorded in Nosturi, Helsinki, on 31 December 2005.

===&quot;Victory Songs&quot; and Meiju&#x27;s departure (2006−2009)===
The recording of the third studio album, called &quot;Victory Songs&quot;, took place between November 2006 and early 2007, and was released on 20 April 2007. A single titled &quot;One More Magic Potion&quot; (after the track of the same name) was released on 7 February. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band released through the producer&#x27;s MySpace page, a music video for the song &quot;Ahti,&quot; which included all band members featured as extras. The video was released after the album release due to video filming problems.

On 10 September 2007, it was announced that keyboardist Meiju Enho would leave the band. This was posted in a bulletin on their MySpace page and later confirmed on their website. The band used Emmi Silvennoinen of Exsecratus as a touring fill-in. Silvennoinen later became a permanent member of the band during the recording of the &quot;From Afar&quot; album.

Ensiferum headlined the Paganfest tour in Europe and North America in 2008. Others playing the tour included Týr and Eluveitie, with Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani also joining them on the European part of the tour, and Turisas in North America. They also supported Megadeth on the opening night of their United Abominations – Tour of Duty European tour. Ensiferum also supported Amon Amarth on their North American &quot;Twilight of the Thunder God&quot; tour.

Shortly before their Russian tour in 2008, Lindroos fell &quot;seriously ill&quot; and was unable to participate. The band hired ex-bassist Jukka-Pekka Miettinen to assume Lindroos&#x27; guitar duties, while bassist Sami Hinkka took over his lead vocal duties for the tour.

In the first half of 2009, Ensiferum performed at a string of festivals including Frostrock in Belgium, Finnish Metal Expo and Tuska Open Air in Finland, Winterfire, Rocktower, Legacy and Rock am Härtsfeldsee in Germany, Summer Nights in Austria, and Z7 Metal Dayz in Switzerland. In June and July they toured North America as part of the Summer Slaughter Tour with Necrophagist, Darkest Hour, Suffocation, Blackguard, Dying Fetus, Beneath the Massacre, Origin, and Winds of Plague. In August they performed at the Global East Rock Festival in Ukraine, Ankkarock and Jurassic Rock in Finland, and Let&#x27;s Open Air in Turkey.

=== &quot;From Afar&quot; and &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; (2009−2012) ===
Ensiferum released their fourth studio album, &quot;From Afar&quot;, on 9 September 2009 with Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Nightwish producer Tero Kinnunen and &quot;Victory Songs&quot; producer Janne Joutsenniemi, and it was mixed by producer Hiili Hiilesmaa. The limited edition of the album includes a cover of Swedish folk rock group Nordman with guest vocalist Heri Joensen of Faroese band Týr. Following the release, the group embarked on a European tour with Estonian folk metal band Metsatöll and Finnish melodic death metal band Tracedawn. In October they performed at Hellflame Festival – The South Side of Hell and Devil&#x27;s Revenge festival in Germany, and Tattoo the Mind in France. Ensiferum performed on the second day of the inaugural Screamfest Festival in Sydney, Australia, on New Years Day 2010. In November/December they toured North America with Ex Deo (on selected dates), and Blackguard.

Ensiferum were also confirmed to play Bloodstock Open Air at Catton Hall, United Kingdom in 2010. In October 2010, Ensiferum embarked on their first ever South African tour. This tour consisted of four shows in two cities, and they were accompanied by numerous local metal bands including Riddare av Koden, Empery and All Forlorn. The final show, at The Black Dahlia in Johannesburg, was filmed to potentially appear on their next live DVD. In early 2011 Ensiferum embarked on The Ugly World Tour 2011 with labelmates Children of Bodom, Amon Amarth, Machinae Supremacy supporting them for segments of their tour in the US and Canada. The tour took place within a 4-month period of time and spanned 23 countries.

The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot;, was released on 24 August 2012. It&#x27;s also their final album for Spinefarm Records. The next year, Ensiferum signed with Metal Blade Records after thirteen years with their previous label. After release of the album, Ensiferum embarked on a tour of Europe and South America.

=== New label, &quot;One Man Army&quot;, and &quot;Two Paths&quot; (2013−2019) ===
Ensiferum&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;One Man Army&quot;, was released on 20 February 2015. The album was recorded at Astia Studio with producer Anssi Kippo. A music video for the title track &quot;One Man Army&quot; was released prior to the album&#x27;s release. In March of that year, Ensiferum announced on their Facebook page that keyboardist Emmi Silvennoinen would not be able to make the European and North American &quot;One Man Army Tour&quot; due to personal commitments at home. Former Turisas accordion player Netta Skog filled her role for the tour. Skog had performed clean vocals on the &quot;One Man Army&quot; songs &quot;Cry for the Earth Bounds&quot; and &quot;Neito Pohjolan&quot;. Heri Joensen of Týr makes an appearance on the track &quot;Heathen Horde&quot;, quoting stanza 16 of &quot;Hávamál&quot; in Old Icelandic.

On 31 March 2016 it was announced that Emmi Silvennoinen would take a leave of absence from the band because of personal issues. Netta Skog was confirmed as her permanent replacement. With Skog in the line-up, the band entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, &quot;Two Paths&quot;. Anssi Kippo, who had produced &quot;One Man Army&quot;, was again chosen to produce the album. The band focused on a more &quot;organic&quot; sound for &quot;Two Paths&quot;, using analog recording and neglecting to use a click track for certain songs. &quot;Two Paths&quot; was released on 15 September 2017.

Skog left the band in December 2017.

=== &quot;Thalassic&quot; and &quot;Winter Storm&quot; (2020−present) ===

On January 7, 2020, the band announced that they had begun recording a follow-up record to &quot;Two Paths&quot;, at Studio Petrax in Hollola, Finland. This release coincides with the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. On February 27, the band confirmed Pekka Montin as their new keyboard player and clean vocalist.

The single &quot;Rum, Women, Victory&quot; was released on May 6, followed by a music video of the second single &quot;Andromeda&quot; on June 17. The band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Thalassic&quot;, was released on 10 July 2020.

On 14 June 2024, it was announced the band would release their ninth studio album, &quot;Winter Storm&quot;, on 18 October.

<doc id="999850" wikidata="Q1892265" url="?curid=999850" title="Maraldi (lunar crater)">
<text>Maraldi is a worn, eroded crater on the western edge of the Sinus Amoris, in the northeast part of the Moon. To the west-southwest is the crater Vitruvius, and to the northwest lies the worn Littrow crater. Just to the northeast of the crater is the dome-like Mons Maraldi rise.

The crater is named after two Italian-born French astronomers: Giovanni Domenico Maraldi and Giacomo F. Maraldi.

Maraldi has a very worn outer wall that is deeply incised and has the appearance of a circular range of peaks rather than a crater rim. The interior has been flooded with basaltic lava, leaving a flat surface with a low albedo. There is a low ridge just to the northwest of the midpoint, and several tiny craters mark the floor surface.

Maraldi is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maraldi.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Maraldi B — &quot;See&quot; Lucian (crater).
* Maraldi M — &quot;See&quot; Theophrastus (crater).

<text>.ch is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Switzerland in the Domain Name System of the Internet. 

== Naming ==
The domain &quot;ch&quot;, as with other ccTLDs, is based on the ISO 3166-2 code for Switzerland derived from &quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot; (Helvetic Confederation), the Latin name for the country, which was used because of its neutrality with regard to the four official languages of Switzerland.

== Registration ==
Made available in 1987, only two years after .com, it is administered by SWITCH Information Technology Services.

Second-level domain names must be at least three letters long. Two-letter subdomain names are restricted to the Swiss cantons, as well as the domain ch.ch of the Federal Chancellery of Switzerland. 

The only exception has been the former domain of the Expo.02 which was held in Switzerland, www.expo.02.ch.

Registrations of internationalized domain names have been accepted since March 2004.

=== In the Chinese domain market ===

.ch has been of a rising interest to Chinese domain investors for several reasons. According to EuropeID.com, the domain .ch still has many valuable English keywords and short letter and number combinations left. 

A contributing factor may be because the majority of .ch registrations are in German, leaving many English words available. 

In addition, with two million domains under .ch being registered, most of the reserved domains have the European market in mind, allowing valuable domains for other languages such as Chinese keywords in the Latin script being registered at a normal price.

== Domain hacks ==
The .ch domain is very popular in domain hacks, used to spell words and names that end in &quot;ch&quot;. 

For example, Techcrunch&#x27;s tcrn.ch, as well as the University of Michigan&#x27;s myumi.ch and umresear.ch. 

This phenomenon is not limited to English; to take another example, the domain scha.ch (&quot;Schach,&quot; German for &quot;chess&quot;) has been registered.

== .swiss ==
The Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) has begun registering .swiss domains as of 7 September 2015 meant to augment the traditional .ch TLD. 

Applicants must currently have a &quot;registered place of business and a physical administrative base in Switzerland&quot; to apply.

<doc id="999857" wikidata="Q6941990" url="?curid=999857" title="Music of Alberta">
<text>Alberta has a diverse music scene of pop, rock, country, jazz, folk, caribbean, classical, and blues music. Music festivals in the Summers are representing these genres. Choral music, ethnic music of many nationalities, all are found in Alberta.

The independent music scene was covered by independent magazines: Fast Forward Weekly in Calgary, and Vue Weekly in Edmonton, neither magazine is currently active. BeatRoute Magazine is still in publication, but covers a wider scope (western Canada, including British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba).

== History ==
Aboriginal music has been present in Alberta since the end of the last ice age, nearly 10,000 years ago in Southern Alberta, around 8,000 year ago in the North. Aboriginal instruments in this part of North American were limited to the voice and the easily made and portable drum. During the fur trade, European fur traders (mostly Orcadian Scots and French-Canadians) added a variety of their own instruments, such as the guitar and the accordion, but most importantly the fiddle. The fiddle became the basis of a distinctive style used in the Western fur trade and associated with the Métis people in particular. In his memoir Buffalo Days and Nights, respected Métis guide and interpreter Peter Erasmus writes that French Métis fiddlers from Lac Ste. Anne played for the Christmas celebrations at Fort Edmonton in 1856. This tradition persisted even after Ontarian and European immigration began to increase after 1870. A list of dances published in the &quot;Edmonton Bulletin&quot; on 3 February 1896 includes several of Métis and Scottish origin.

<text>Maskelyne is a solitary lunar impact crater that lies in the southeast part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 22 km. It was named after British astronomer Nevil Maskelyne. The outer rim has a somewhat polygonal shape, although it is generally circular. The inner walls are d and there is a low central rise at the midpoint of the floor.

Tranquility Base, the landing site of the 1969 Apollo 11 expedition, is located about 250 kilometers to the west-southwest. To the northeast are Wallach and Aryabhata. To the southeast is the bright Censorinus. To the south are the lunar mountains informally known as Duke Island and Boot Hill. There are sinuous rilles southwest and west of Maskelyne - these were informally named &quot;Sidewinder&quot; and &quot;Diamondback&quot; by the Apollo 10 crew and referred to as such by later missions, especially Apollo 11.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maskelyne.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Maskelyne E — &quot;See&quot; Aryabhata (crater).
* Maskelyne H — &quot;See&quot; Wallach (crater).

<text>Mercator is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Nubium, in the southwest part of the Moon. It was named after 16th-century Southern Dutch cartographer Gerardus Mercator. It is located to the southeast of the crater Campanus, and the two are separated by a narrow, winding valley.

The Rupes Mercator fault is tangential with the northeastern outer rim of Mercator. The eastern edge of Palus Epidemiarum reaches the west rim of Mercator, and a rille from the Rimae Ramsden reaches the western rim at the site of the craterlet Mercator C.

The rim of Mercator is only somewhat eroded, and several tiny craters lie on the west and eastern rims. The interior floor has been flooded by lava in the past, leaving a relatively smooth and featureless surface.

Mercator is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mercator.

<doc id="999864" wikidata="Q2453548" url="?curid=999864" title="Trinity (video game)">
<text>Trinity is an interactive fiction video game written by Brian Moriarty and published in 1986 by Infocom. It is widely regarded as one of the company&#x27;s best works.

The plot blends historical and fantastic elements as part of a prose poem regarding the destructive power of the atomic bomb and the futile nature of war in the atomic age. The name refers to the Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion, which took place in July 1945. It is Infocom&#x27;s twentieth game and the last game released by the company when it was solvent.

== Plot ==
As the game begins, the player&#x27;s character is spending a final day of a London vacation in the Kensington Gardens. The evening flight back to the United States is looking increasingly unlikely for a number of unusual reasons. Hordes of nannies are blocking all exits from the Gardens, and the grass actively resists efforts to be walked upon. Worst of all, a gleam on the horizon soon heralds the unwelcome arrival of a Soviet nuclear missile. Time begins to slow as the missile approaches, and with some ingenuity the player&#x27;s character finds an incongruous door hovering in mid-air. There&#x27;s no telling where it may lead, but it cannot possibly be worse than the alternative of being at ground zero of a nuclear detonation...

The doorway leads to a strange land, where impossible objects exist. Space and time do not seem to behave in the familiar ways here. Exploring this new environment, the player finds several other mysterious doors, each of which leads to another chapter in the history of nuclear weaponry. After visiting test sites (including ones in Siberia, Nevada, and the Eniwetok Atoll) and Nagasaki just before each device is detonated, the player has one scenario left to deal with. The final door leads to the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, mere minutes before the test-firing that will change the course of history. But something is wrong at the &quot;Trinity&quot; site, and without the player&#x27;s intervention things will go horribly awry.

The player is witness to, or rather narrowly escapes being a witness to, a number of nuclear explosions in the game. The sites visited, and the markings on the sundial that represent them, are:
* London, near future (fictional, Omega)
* Low Earth Orbit, near future (fictional, Mercury)
* Nevada (underground), 1970 (historical, Pluto)
* Eniwetok Atoll, Pacific Ocean, 1952 (historical, Neptune)
* Siberia, 1949 (historical, Libra)
* Nagasaki, Japan, 1945 (historical, Mars)
* Trinity, New Mexico, 1945 (historical, Alpha)

Each of the symbols has a meaning relevant to the incident it represents. Trinity was the site of the first atomic explosion, and is therefore represented by an alpha, which is the first character of the Greek alphabet. The bombing of Nagasaki was an act of war, and Mars is the Roman god of war. The test in Siberia (actually in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) was an example of another superpower attempting to establish balance in the nuclear arms race, and the zodiacal sign of Libra is represented by the scales, making a reference to restoring the balance. The Eniwetok Atoll test took place in the middle of the ocean; hence it is symbolized by Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. The Nevada test is underground, and thus represented by Pluto, god of the underworld. The fictional incident in London was chronologically the latest to take place, and omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. The symbols also appear at the corresponding locations in &quot;The Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb&quot; comic, which was included with the game. The fictional Low Earth Orbit (Mercury) detonation is very likely a reference to the space interceptor subproject of the Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot;, contemporary with the game&#x27;s development. &quot;Trinity&quot; also includes numerous references to British children&#x27;s literature, including the Alice books of Lewis Carroll, the Mary Poppins books of P. L. Travers, and especially J. M. Barrie″s novel &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;.

==Development==
Brian Moriarty created &quot;Trinity&quot;″s story in 1983. After joining Infocom in 1984 he proposed it to the company, but management believed that it was too large for the z-machine at the time. After completing &quot;Wishbringer&quot; Moriarty began working on &quot;Trinity&quot; in May 1985, researching the history of nuclear weapons and visiting the Trinity site and Los Alamos, New Mexico. He attempted to make the game accurately depict the geography of New Mexico and Kensington Gardens. Moriarty completed the game in June 1986, and later stated that &quot;writing it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience, I can tell you that. It&#x27;s not easy to sit down and write that stuff ... It was hard to live with that game for a year&quot;. He added, however, that &quot;&quot;Trinity&quot; is not a funeral, and [don&#x27;t] be afraid of it. It&#x27;s kind of a dark game, but it&#x27;s also, I like to think, kind of a fun game, too. But I do want people to think about what they see.&quot;

==Release==
The packaging for &quot;Trinity&quot; contained several items, called feelies, related to the plot of the game. These feelies included: 
* A map of the Trinity site
* A cardboard sundial marked with odd symbols
* &quot;The Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb&quot;, an &quot;educational&quot; comic book laden with ironic statements regarding the feelings of patriotism, idealism, and jingoism surrounding the production of atomic weaponry
* Instructions on how to fold an origami crane (orizuru) using the Yoshizawa–Randlett system (a reference to Sadako Sasaki), and a small square of origami paper with which to do it.

==Reception==
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Trinity&quot; at number 100 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;&quot;Trinity&quot; takes the same types of serious themes of &quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot;, and adds to them a heavy dose of mythology and fantasy. ... this is not only one of the most socially and politically powerful game experiences ever created, but also a landscape upon which puzzles of trademark Infocom quality can appear.&quot; Later the same year, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; listed &quot;Trinity&quot; at #120 among their top 150 best games of all time. The editors called it &quot;a tense, ethical tightrope walk through the Cold War&quot;.

==Legacy==
Trinity was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

Video game designer and programmer Jonathan Blow mentioned &quot;Trinity&quot; as one of his formative influences 
and was a significant inspiration for his game, Braid.

<text>thumb|240px|View of Mersenius from Earth [2013-07-19 23:19

Mersenius is a lunar impact crater that is located to the west of the Mare Humorum, in the southwestern part of the Moon. To the southwest is the crater Cavendish, and to the south-southeast lies Liebig. Mersenius is 84 kilometers in diameter and 2.3 kilometers deep. It is from the Nectarian period, 3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago.

The rim of Mersenius is heavily worn, especially in the low northern section. The crater Mersenius N lies across the southwestern rim. The interior has been flooded by basaltic lava, which bulges upwards forming a domed shape with an estimated height of 450 metres relative to the floor edges. This was most likely formed by lava upwelling beneath the surface. There are several tiny craters across the floor surface, but little in the way of a central peak. At least two faint rilles lie along the surface of the floor.

To the east of the crater on the surface and edges of the Mare Humorum is a rille system designated Rimae Mersenius. These rilles are generally parallel and run to the north-northeast for a length of about 230 kilometers.

The crater was named after the 17th-century French philosopher and physicist Marin Mersenne in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mersenius.

<doc id="999875" wikidata="Q2647616" url="?curid=999875" title="Roy of the Rovers">
<text>Roy of the Rovers is a British comic strip about the life and times of a fictional footballer and later manager named Roy Race, who played for Melchester Rovers. The strip first appeared in the &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) comic, published by IPC and Fleetway from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature.

The weekly strip ran until 1993, following Roy&#x27;s playing career until its conclusion after he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy&#x27;s son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly &quot;Match of the Day&quot; football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine&#x27;s closure in May 2001.

In 2018, following the acquisition of the strip&#x27;s rights by comic book publisher Rebellion, a brand new rebooted &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; story, following the adventures of a 16-year-old Roy in the present day, began publication as a series of original graphic novels and prose novels.

Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; was the most popular. The strip usually saw Rovers competing for honours at the top of the English and European game, although in some years the storylines would see the club struggle for form, including a relegation from the First Division in the early 1980s. As well as dealing in on-pitch action, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; featured high drama off the pitch, with kidnapping storylines a recurring feature of its early decades. From the 1970s onwards, stories included a shooting, a terrorist atrocity, and several celebrity guest appearances. Rovers played in a fictional universe made up of invented teams; however, real-life players including Emlyn Hughes, Bob Wilson and Malcolm Macdonald made appearances in the strip, as did former England manager Alf Ramsey.

The stock media phrase &quot;real &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; stuff&quot; is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip&#x27;s trademark.

==Publication history==
=== &quot;Tiger&quot; ===
Roy of the Rovers first appeared on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine &quot;Tiger&quot;, debuting on the front page of the first issue.

=== Self-titled weekly comic ===
After 22 years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851 issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features.

At the peak of the comic&#x27;s success, about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; was serialised in the now-defunct &quot;Today&quot; newspaper. The strip concluded abruptly, mid-story, on 29 August 1987. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. A new strip was launched in the Daily Star on 13 November 1989, written by regular writer Tom Tully and drawn by veteran Roy artist Yvonne Hutton. Hutton&#x27;s final Roy of the Rovers artwork appeared on 17 January 1992, with Mike Western debuting on the art the following day. The strip concluded on 14 May 1993, two months after the cancellation of the weekly comic. Between 1988 and 1993, a &quot;Best of Roy of the Rovers&quot; monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.

Following the closure of the weekly title in 1993, the strip appeared in a relaunched monthly publication in September that year, with grittier storylines intended to attract teen and young adult fans who had read the weekly comic in their youth. Between January 1994 and January 1995, the monthly strips were mirrored by a weekly edition in &quot;Shoot&quot; magazine, which had in the late 1980s published a parody called &quot;Ray of the Rangers&quot;. The relaunched &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; comic ended in 1995.

=== &quot;Match of the Day&quot; ===
The comic strip was resurrected in July 1997, printed as short (usually two-page) features in the BBC&#x27;s monthly &quot;Match of the Day&quot; magazine. These strips ran until the magazine&#x27;s demise in May 2001. By then the strip&#x27;s wholesome tone, often espousing the virtues of fair play and strong moral character, was beginning to seem old-fashioned. The editor of &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; comic, Barrie Tomlinson, has commented that &quot;everyone seemed to be growing up a bit more quickly, and they wanted stories that were more realistic&quot;. This series ran until 2001.

=== Re-issues and collections ===
Then-rights holder Egmont published a 64-page &quot;collectors edition&quot; of the comic strip in April 2009, gathering together a number of 1980&#x27;s era &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; stories in addition to other backup strips from the comic. Two &quot;Best of Roy of the Rovers&quot; books, featuring successive runs of strips from the 1980s and 1970s, were published in June 2008 and 2009 respectively.

In 2016, the rights to &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; and the rest of the Fleetway comics library were acquired by Rebellion Developments, who subsequently rebooted the series to follow the modern-day adventures of Roy as a teenager. A series of hardcover graphic novels began publication in 2018, written by Rob Williams and drawn by Ben Willsher, running in parallel with a series of novels for younger readers written by Tom Palmer with illustrations by Lisa Henke.

==Plot==

The story followed Roy Race, a striker for the fictional football team Melchester Rovers, based in a town of the same name in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20 years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40 seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.

Roy won a number of trophies during his career with Rovers, including nine league titles, eight FA Cups, three League Cups, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup, and four Cup Winners&#x27; Cups, and he also made several appearances for England. He married club secretary Penny Laine at the end of the 1975–76 season, with whom he had three children: Roy Jr. (later known as Rocky), Melinda, and Diana. Penny left Roy in the early 1980s, in a high-profile storyline that was covered on national television news. The following year Roy was shot in his office by a mystery gunman, in an incident clearly mirroring the shooting of J. R. Ewing in the hit television series &quot;Dallas&quot; the previous year. Roy lay in a coma for several weeks. The culprit was eventually revealed to be Elton Blake, an actor who had been cast as Roy in a television series about the Rovers, but who blamed him for his dismissal. In early 1983 Roy swapped Melchester Rovers for ambitious London side Walford Rovers after a fallout with the Melchester directors, but his stint away was short-lived and he was back at his spiritual home by the end of the year. In July 1986 eight members of the Rovers team were killed during a club tour of the fictional Middle Eastern country of Basran, when terrorists accidentally crashed a bomb-laden car into the team bus. Roy escaped with a dislocated shoulder. Author Mick Collins has commented that &quot;Even as youngsters, we knew that this certainly bordered on bad taste, and probably overstepped the mark.&quot;
The final incident of Roy&#x27;s playing career came in the closing pages of the last weekly issue, in March 1993, when he lost control of his helicopter and crashed into a field. Thus the weekly strip ended its 39-year unbroken run on a downbeat and unresolved cliffhanger, as Roy was taken into hospital while fans, the media and his family awaited news on his condition. The mystery of whether or not Roy had survived his crash was unresolved until the first issue of the new &quot;Roy of the Rovers Monthly&quot; in September 1993, in which readers discovered that the accident had resulted in the amputation of his famous left foot, ending his playing career and resulting in his move to Italy as the manager of Serie A side AC Monza (a fictional top-level Italian club, rather than the real club of the same name).

Reconciling the continuity of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story&#x27;s writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester&#x27;s history, and shortened Roy Sr.&#x27;s recorded playing career to a more realistic level.

By the time the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, on the verge of bankruptcy, and their long-term future far from certain. When the strip returned in &quot;Match of the Day&quot; magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic&#x27;s new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.

Roy was persuaded to rejoin Melchester as manager and part-owner, backed by the unscrupulous Vinter brothers, and he arrived just in time to save the club from relegation. The following season, Roy and Rocky resolved their differences. Rocky rejoined Melchester, and the club was promoted back into the Premier League at the end of the year. When the magazine closed in 2001, Rovers were attempting to achieve a league placing that would secure them UEFA Champions League football, giving them financial security. Although this storyline was never resolved, there was nevertheless a certain sense of closure as, shortly beforehand, Roy Sr. had wrested full control of the club from the Vinters, thus completing his 44-year progression from player to owner.

=== 2018 revival ===

The 2018 revival series of graphic novels and younger reader novels follows 16-year-old Roy Race as he attempts to earn a trial at Melchester Rovers, a once-proud club that now sit down in League One. Roy divides his time between college and looking after his disabled father, but dreams of playing for Melchester as a striker. He impresses Melchester manager Kevin &quot;Mighty&quot; Mouse and coach Johnny &quot;Hard Man&quot; Dexter at his trial, and is signed on as a trainee – but suddenly finds himself, along with the rest of the youth team, promoted to the first team squad when the club&#x27;s entire roster of professional players are sold to ensure Melchester&#x27;s financial survival. The first season follows Roy and the Melchester squad as they strive to qualify for the playoffs and gain promotion to the Championship.

Along with Mouse and Dexter, several other characters from &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; history are repurposed for the reboot, including goalkeeper Gordon Stewart (formerly the star of backup series &quot;The Safest Hands in Soccer&quot;), club captain Vic Guthrie (a Welsh under-17 star and Roy&#x27;s main rival in the series), towering central defender Lofty Peak (brought to Rovers by his friend Roy after showing his prowess playing basketball), and Roy&#x27;s childhood friend William &quot;Blackie&quot; Gray, who joins Rovers on loan from Premier League side Islington. New characters created for the series include Roy&#x27;s younger sister Roxanne, nicknamed &quot;Rocky&quot; (a homage to Roy&#x27;s son from the original series), and Vic Guthrie&#x27;s sister Ffion.

==Recurring characteristics==
Over the years, the strip became famous for its employment of certain types of storyline and stylistic storytelling devices. For example, despite the fast-paced nature of a football match, exposition would be provided by members of the crowd apparently commenting to one another. Fans made lengthy comments in the short time it took the ball to travel through the air; as the ball was struck towards the goal a member of the crowd might be seen saying &quot;Racey&#x27;s had a shot!&quot;, followed by another responding &quot;The &#x27;keeper won&#x27;t make it!&quot;. Nonetheless, loyal readers would usually suspend disbelief, a characteristic later parodied by &quot;Viz&quot; magazine&#x27;s Billy the Fish, a fish with a human head who plays in goal for Fulchester United.

In the interests of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours at the top of the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next.

Storylines often centred on new signings who were unable to settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and expected the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that made it difficult for the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.

When playing foreign teams, particularly in the European club competitions, the opposition would often cynically employ overt gamesmanship or downright dirty tactics. Continental sides were considered to be &quot;sneaky&quot;:


The strip followed the structure of the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something more exciting than the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. &quot;Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle than they ever did in more mundane settings.&quot; The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle-Eastern state, offered him £1 million to coach the national team.

Especially during the 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars Bob Wilson and Emlyn Hughes were brought out of retirement to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans of the strip Martin Kemp and Steve Norman, of the pop group Spandau Ballet. Geoff Boycott served for several years as Melchester&#x27;s chairman, and Sir Alf Ramsey had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy lay in his coma. Players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, despite the fact that the clubs they played for in real life were never featured in the strip.

The concept of TV pundits and anchormen making appearances was a later development. When Roy announced his resignation as Rovers manager in 1992, he did so live on Sky Sports in front of shocked presenters Richard Keys and Andy Gray.

==Creators==

===Writers===
Roy was created by the author Frank S. Pepper, who had created the similar strip, &quot;Danny of the Dazzlers&quot;, but he only wrote four installments of &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; because of his commitments to another of his characters, &quot;Captain Condor&quot;. Pepper&#x27;s role was taken by the strip&#x27;s first artist Joe Colquhoun, who used the pen-name &quot;Stewart Colwyn&quot;. He was replaced after four-and-a-half years by Derek Birnage, the editor of &quot;Tiger&quot;, who had commissioned the strip. In 1960, in an attempt to whip up publicity, it was announced that the footballer Bobby Charlton had taken over as writer, although in reality it was still written by Birnage (who claimed that he did consult with Charlton occasionally for story ideas). The longest-serving writer of the strip was Tom Tully, who began in 1969 on an intermittent basis and then continuously from 1974 until the end of the weekly comic in 1993. Ian Rimmer became the main writer for the strip during the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; years, until the magazine&#x27;s closure in May 2001. The 2018 reboot is written by Rob Williams (graphic novels) and Tom Palmer (novels).

===Artists===
After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded first by Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who illustrated from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque took over in 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, he was responsible for one of the strip&#x27;s more definitive looks in its early &#x27;80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former &quot;2000 AD&quot; artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White&#x27;s. A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip&#x27;s creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; annuals and also drew the &quot;Roy&#x27;s Action Replay&quot; strip that appeared in &quot;All Action Monthly&quot; in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; strips for all four years.

The rebooted graphic novels that began publication in 2018 are drawn by Ben Willsher, while Lisa Henke illustrates the prose novels.

==Cultural impact==
The phrase &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; has become a trope familiar to generations of British football fans and sports commentators, used to describe a memorable sporting achievement such as winning against the odds, or an unexpected comeback. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper of 10 April 1995, for instance, described future England captain Alan Shearer as &quot;the classic working class sporting hero ... everything legend demands an English centre-forward should be ... As a striker he comes closer to fitting the &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; fantasy than anyone else lately admired by English crowds&quot;. Shearer was at that time the leading goal-scorer for &quot;unfashionable&quot; Blackburn Rovers F.C., who were on the verge of winning the Premiership title.

Comparisons have been drawn between the fictional Roy Race and the captain of England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup winning team, Bobby Moore, whose playing career spanned a similar time-scale to that of Roy&#x27;s. Moore&#x27;s death in 1993, just days after the last edition of the &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; comic was published, produced a &quot;literature of tribute&quot;, framed around themes &quot;remarkably similar to those at the center of the Roy Race fiction and ideology ... there was a clear sense of mourning for the loss of an age&quot;.
==Spin-offs and merchandise==
&quot;Roy of the Rovers Annual&quot;s were produced every year from 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; in 1999, in the form of a cardboard cut-out.

A &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; computer game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was split into two parts: the first an adventure game, in which – taking the role of Roy Race – the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match to raise funds for the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, but only 3/10 from &quot;Sinclair User&quot;.

A number of official Melchester Rovers Subbuteo teams were produced in the 1980s and 1990s. There was also an officially licensed board game in the 1980s, which saw players take on the role of Roy Race and manage the club. Replica Melchester Rovers shirts have been available at various stages of the series&#x27; life, up to and including a strip designed and produced by Hummel for the 2018 reboot.

In 1990, &quot;Roy Race&quot; and footballer Gary Lineker released a single, &quot;Europe United&quot;, described in the comic as &quot;a hot rocking heavy metal rap&quot;, which failed to chart in the UK Top 40. The confectionery company McCowans produced a pineapple-flavoured &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; chew bar in the 1990s.

==Collected editions==
On 29 February 2008 it was announced that Titan Books had acquired worldwide book publishing rights to a range of Egmont&#x27;s comic strips, including &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;. The first of their compilations of Roy&#x27;s playing days, &quot;The Best of Roy of the Rovers: The 1980s&quot; was released in May 2008 and included the &quot;Relegation&quot; and &quot;Who Shot Roy&quot; story arcs. &quot;The Bumper Book of Roy of the Rovers&quot; was published in October 2008, and reprinted strips, articles, short stories and features taken from Roy annuals dated from 1957 to 1971. Two further titles were released in 2009, &quot;The Best of the 1970s and The Second Bumper Book&quot;, and a third &quot;Best of&quot;, focusing on the World Cup, was released in 2010. All five of the titles were edited and compiled by David Leach.

<text>Western Sahara is a disputed territory, and as such it has no country code top-level domain (ccTLD). .eh is reserved for this purpose, and will be assigned if the Western Sahara conflict results in an agreement between the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Morocco. IANA has not designated a ccTLD manager for the .eh domain.

==History==
The letters .eh correspond to &quot;Sáhara Español&quot; (ESH, as Western Sahara was previously called Spanish Sahara) and also match Saguia el-Hamra, one of two provinces in the earlier Spanish Sahara.

On August 1, 2007, an international consortium made a bid to IANA to administer the .eh domain on behalf of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Morocco, which controls most of Western Sahara, has made competing claims to the domain.

On October 16, 2007, ICANN decided not to delegate &quot;.eh&quot; at all, with the explanation that:
there are currently two applicants for the delegation of the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .EH (Western Sahara). Both requests meet the technical criteria for managing a top-level domain. In cases like this, IANA has a long-standing policy of requesting that the two contesting applicants work together to find a mutual solution that will serve the needs of the local Internet community in the best possible fashion. ICANN does not see a way to approve the .EH ccTLD delegation to one of the applicants without violating its long-standing policy unless the contesting parties are able to reach an agreement.The two applicants remain armed belligerents; no such agreement has been reached and the domain remains inactive.

==Publicity==
On April 1, 2013 the Canadian Internet Registration Authority announced it would be releasing .eh domain names to consumers as part of an April Fools&#x27; Day joke, the TLD being a play on the interjection &quot;eh&quot;, which is stereotypically associated with Canadians and Canada.

<text>Meton is a compound formation on the Moon that consists of several merged crater rings that have been flooded with lava, forming the remnant of a walled plain in the shape of a clover leaf. It is located near the northern lunar limb, and is viewed from a low angle and foreshortened. The crater Barrow is attached to the southwest rim. To the northwest is the crater Scoresby, and to the east are Baillaud and Euctemon.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Meton.

<text>.kp is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for North Korea (DPRK). It was created on 24 September 2007.

==History==
The DPRK applied for the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in 2004. ICANN, however, refused because the DPRK did not meet some of the requirements. Another attempt was later made via the Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe in 2006. The main body of KCC and the DPRK Ambassador to the United Nations petitioned ICANN again. They were refused again for providing insufficient information. A new application was sent in January 2007, and an ICANN delegation visited the country in May. This time, ICANN finally agreed to assign to the DPRK.

One of the first organizations to adopt a domain was the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in 2009.

Previously, the domain was managed by the Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe. A large number of websites were also hosted by KCC Europe in Germany. However, in 2011, management was transferred to the Pyongyang-based Star Joint Venture.

== Second-level domains ==
Neither the DPRK government agencies nor the central registry have published the second-level domain registration rules. However, according to the using practices shown by the currently existing and accessible DPRK domains and websites, while regarding the worldwide country code second-level domain distribution rules, the second-level domain rules in the DPRK can be interpreted as below.

* &quot;aca.kp&quot; : Academic research institutes
* &quot;com.kp&quot; : Companies
* &quot;edu.kp&quot; : Higher education institutions
* &quot;law.kp&quot; : Legal firms
* &quot;org.kp&quot; : Organizations
* &quot;gov.kp&quot; : Government departments
* &quot;rep.kp&quot; : Agencies associated with the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea
* &quot;net.kp&quot; : Internet service providers and email service providers
* &quot;sca.kp&quot; : Affiliated institutes under the Ministry of Culture

The following are externally accessible domain name examples of the use of second-level domain names:

* &quot;aca.kp&quot; : mirae.aca.kp
* &quot;com.kp&quot; : airkoryo.com.kp, knic.com.kp, friend.com.kp
* &quot;edu.kp&quot; : ryongnamsan.edu.kp, kut.edu.kp, gpsh.edu.kp
* &quot;law.kp&quot; : fia.law.kp
* &quot;org.kp&quot; : cooks.org.kp, koredufund.org.kp, kass.org.kp
* &quot;gov.kp&quot; : mfa.gov.kp, moph.gov.kp, tourismdprk.gov.kp
* &quot;rep.kp&quot; : rodong.rep.kp, vok.rep.kp, gnu.rep.kp
* &quot;net.kp&quot; : [Usually appears as the extension for email addresses published elsewhere on other DPRK websites: e.g. &quot;@star-co.net.kp&quot;]
* &quot;sca.kp&quot; : korart.sca.kp

<doc id="999890" wikidata="Q687478" url="?curid=999890" title="Meade Instruments">
<text>The Meade Instruments (also shortened to Meade) was an American multinational company headquartered in Watsonville, California, that manufactured, imported and distributed telescopes, binoculars, spotting scopes, microscopes, CCD cameras, and telescope accessories for the consumer market. It was, at one point, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of telescopes.

Besides selling under its &quot;Meade&quot; brand name, the company sells solar telescopes under the brand &quot;Coronado&quot;.

In July 2024, Sky and Telescope magazine reported that Optronic Technologies, the owner of Meade Instruments and Orion Telescopes, had closed their facilities in California and had laid off all of their employees. As of July 15, there had been no official announcement from the company, and S&amp;T said they were trying to get more information from their sources. As of December, 2024, the Sky&amp;Telescope website announced that the assets of Meade, Coronado and Orion Telescopes and Binoculars would be listed for auction and that these companies were ceasing operations. 

==Origins and history==
Founded in 1972 by John Diebel, Meade started as a mail order seller of small refracting telescopes and telescope accessories manufactured by the Japan-based Towa Optical Manufacturing Company. Meade started manufacturing its own line of products in 1976, introducing 6&quot; and 8&quot; reflecting telescopes models in 1977. In 1980, the company ventured into the Schmidt-Cassegrain market that up to that time had been dominated by Celestron Corporation. Meade has a long history of litigation with other companies over infringement of their patents, particularly with its once bitter rival Celestron. In August 2008, Meade modified their line of Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with changes to the optical surfaces in design they call &quot;Advanced Coma-Free optics&quot; (ACF Optics).

Past production sites include 16542 Millikan Avenue in Irvine, which was used in the 1990s. Meade production was consequently moved to a new build plant in 6001 Oak Canyon, located as well in Irvine. The Oak Canyon plant was in use for about a decade until 2009, after which production was moved to an expanded plant in Tijuana, Mexico.

In October 2013, Meade Instruments merged with Ningbo Sunny Electronic, a Chinese manufacturer, and Joseph Lupica became CEO of Meade. In February 2015, Victor Aniceto succeeded Lupica as president.

On November 26, 2019, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a federal jury found that Ningbo and Meade suppressed competition and fixed prices for consumer telescopes in the United States in violation of federal antitrust laws (case# 16-06370). Optronic Technologies, Inc. was awarded $16.8 million in damages.

On December 4, 2019, Meade Instruments Corp. filed bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Central District of California as case number 19-14714.

==Products==
Products produced by Meade include:

===Catadioptric cassegrains===

====ACF telescopes====
ACF (&quot;Advanced Coma-Free&quot;) is an altered version of the Meade&#x27;s previous schmidt-cassegrain telescopes that replaces the traditional spherical schmidt-cassegrain secondary mirror with a hyperbolic secondary mirror. In the new design the full aperture corrector is slightly altered in shape and combined with a spherical primary mirror. Meade&#x27;s literature describes their ACF as a variation on the Ritchey-Chrétien telescope, although it does not use the two hyperbolic mirror combination in that design (being more of an &quot;aplantic&quot; design).
;Models
* LX90-ACF, 8&quot; to 12&quot;
* LX200-ACF, a series of LX200 with ACF Optics 8&quot; to 16&quot;
*LX400-ACF, 16 to 20&quot; f/8, w/ robotic equatorial mount
*LX800

====Maksutov telescopes====

Meade produces a line of Maksutov telescopes under their ETX series (Everybody&#x27;s Telescope). They were first produced in 90 mm (3-1/2&quot;) Maksutov Cassegrain telescope in 1996. They range in size from 90 mm to 125 mm.

===Newtonian telescopes===

* Schmidt-Newtonian telescopes (6 to 10 inches).
* LightBridge Dobsonian telescopes (currently 8, 10, 12 and a 16-inch model)
* Meade Model 4504: equatorial reflecting telescope

===GoTo telescopes===
Many Meade telescope lines are classified by the self aiming computerized alt-azimuth and equatorial mounts they come on, a technology commonly called a &quot;GoTo&quot; mount.
;Models
* LXD75, including Newtonian, Schmidt-Newtonian, Advanced Coma-Free, and achromatic refractor telescopes
* ETX-LS, 150mm (6 in) and 200mm (8 in) F/10 ACF telescope on a single-fork arm with integral GPS and &#x27;Eclips&#x27; camera for self-alignment.
* DS-2000 Series, 80mm (3.1&quot;) refractor, 114mm (4.5&quot;) and 130mm (5.1&quot;) reflector on altazimuth Goto mounts
* LX80, LX90
* ETX-70, ETX-80
* LX85, including Newtonian, Schmidt-Newtonian, Advanced Coma-Free, and achromatic refractor telescopes

===Solar telescopes===
In 2004, Meade acquired &quot;Coronado Filters&quot; from founder and designer David Lunt, who produce an extensive range of specialty telescopes that allow views of the sun in Hydrogen-Alpha, and formerly, at &quot;Calcium K line&quot; wavelengths. The Meade Coronado telescopes are called &quot;Solarmax 40&quot; or higher depending on the model.

===Other products===
* Achromatic refractors (5 and 6-inch)
* Meade also sells under the &quot;Meade&quot; name imported low to moderate cost reflectors and refractors intended for the beginner retail market.

===Telescope accessories===
Accessories produced by Meade include the series 5000 eyepieces that are comparable in construction to those of Chester, New York-based Tele Vue Optical&#x27;s &quot;Nagler&quot; (82-degree field of view), &quot;Panoptic&quot; (68-degree field of view), and &quot;Radian&quot; (60-degree field of view) eyepieces. Meade sells Deep Sky and Lunar digital imagers for telescopes. They also market the &quot;mySKY&quot; &amp; &quot;mySKY Plus&quot;, multi-media GPS devices guiding users to the sky, similar to the competing Celestron SkyScout.

==Litigation==
In November, 2006, plaintiffs including Star Instruments and RC Optical Systems, manufacturers of traditional Ritchey-Chrétien optics and telescopes, filed a civil lawsuit against Meade, several dealerships, and other individuals in federal court (New York Southern District). The complaint was against Meade advertising their RCX400 and LX200R models as &quot;Ritchey-Chrétien.&quot; The plaintiffs claimed these models did not use true Ritchey-Chrétien optics and therefore Meade and its retailers were committing false advertising infringing on the plaintiff&#x27;s market. In January 2008, Meade settled, with a &quot;small&quot; amount paid to the plaintiffs and the requirement to rename the affected products, not using any initials that might suggest Ritchey-Chrétien.

On September 27, 2006, Finkelstein, Thompson &amp; Loughran filed a class action lawsuit against Meade. The complaint alleged that, throughout the Class Period, defendants misrepresented and omitted material facts concerning Meade&#x27;s backdating of stock option grants to two of its officers. A settlement of $2,950,000 was reached in December, 2007.

==Financial problems==
Meade has had financial problems in the past and has survived with the help of its founder, John Diebel, purchasing back the company. However, Meade in the past few years has run into another round of financial woes, since Diebel sold the company again. The previous CEO since May 2006, Steve Muellner had announced various bad news for the company since he had the lead role for Meade. Meade&#x27;s Irvine, California manufacturing plant was closed, with manufacturing moved to a new plant in Mexico, and a majority of the administrative positions were cut. Meade&#x27;s customer service line has also been affected by the move to Mexico, including shorter operating hours and the elimination of the callback option. Meade is also looking at other options for the uncertain future of the company. No matter what the future was holding for the company, Muellner and some of the board members signed an agreement to cover themselves financially.

In April 2008, Meade sold two of its three non-telescope product brands (Weaver/Redfield) to two companies for a total of $8 million. However, as compensation for divestiture of these two brands, out-going VP of Sales, Robert Davis, received a $100,000 bonus from the company. On June 13, 2008, Meade sold their last non-telescope brand Simmons to Bushnell for $7.25 million. Also in 2008, Meade&#x27;s stock value fell below one dollar, bringing up the possibility of Meade being delisted from the stock exchange. On October 3, 2008, Meade eliminated Donald Finkle&#x27;s Senior Vice President position with the company providing him with one year of salary as severance and certain other benefits.

Meade announced on January 29, 2009 that it had sold Meade Europe, its European subsidiary, for 12.4 million dollars, thus relieving much of Meade&#x27;s debt. However, that reduced the company&#x27;s assets greatly. Further changes and unknown stability of the company was announced on February 5, 2009, with the resignation of Steve Muellner, chairman of the board Harry Casari and fellow board member James Chadwick. Former CEO Steven Murdock was reinstated as Meade CEO. On March 5, 2009, the company announced the resignation of CFO Paul Ross and the assumption of the position by John Elwood. With his resignation, Ross receives a severance in the lump sum of $260,000. During the summer of 2009, Meade announced a 20:1 reverse stock split in hopes of raising the value of their stock.

By July 8, 2013, Meade Instruments was tipping their hand on whether to recommend selling the company to a Chinese co. or a San Jose venture capital firm, plow ahead alone, or possibly seek bankruptcy protection. In September 2013, Sunny Optics Inc, a unit of the Chinese firm Ningbo Sunny Electronic Co Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Meade.

In November 2019, Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars won a lawsuit against Ningbo Sunny Electronic Co Ltd for price fixing and anti-competitive practices costing Sunny Ningbo an estimated 20 million dollars in settlement. Meade under Ningbo Sunny ownership shortly after declared bankruptcy. On June 1, 2021, Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars announced the acquisition rescue of Meade Instruments, following the approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California.

<doc id="999895" wikidata="Q689128" url="?curid=999895" title="Haitian Revolution">
<text>The Haitian Revolution ( or ; ) was a successful insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign state of Haiti. The revolution was the only known slave uprising in human history that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery (though not from forced labour) and ruled by non-whites and former captives.

The revolt began on 22 August 1791, and ended in 1804 with the former colony&#x27;s independence. It involved black, biracial, French, Spanish, British, and Polish participants—with the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture emerging as Haiti&#x27;s most prominent general. The successful revolution was a defining moment in the history of the Atlantic World and the revolution&#x27;s effects on the institution of slavery were felt throughout the Americas. The end of French rule and the abolition of slavery in the former colony was followed by a successful defense of the freedoms the former slaves had won, and with the collaboration of already free people of color, of their independence from white Europeans.
The revolution was the largest slave uprising since Spartacus&#x27; unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1,900 years earlier, and challenged long-held European beliefs about alleged black inferiority and about slaves&#x27; ability to achieve and maintain their own freedom. The rebels&#x27; organizational capacity and tenacity under pressure inspired stories that shocked and frightened slave owners in the hemisphere.

Compared to other Atlantic revolutions, the events in Haiti have received comparatively little public attention in retrospect: historian Michel-Rolph Trouillot characterizes the historiography of the Haitian Revolution as being &quot;silenced&quot; by that of the French Revolution.

==Background==
===Slave economy in Saint-Domingue===
Much of Caribbean economic development in the 18th century was contingent on Europeans&#x27; demand for sugar. Plantation owners produced sugar as a commodity crop from cultivation of sugarcane, which required extensive labor. The colony of Saint-Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, but these were smaller and less profitable than the sugar plantations. The commodity crops were traded for European goods.

Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex irrigation systems to increase sugarcane production. By the 1740s, Saint-Domingue, together with the British colony of Jamaica, had become the main suppliers of the world&#x27;s sugar. Production of sugar depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans. An average of 600 ships engaged every year in shipping products from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux, and the value of the colony&#x27;s crops and goods was almost equal in value to all of the products shipped from the Thirteen Colonies to Great Britain. The livelihood of 1 million of the approximately 25 million people who lived in France in 1789 depended directly upon the agricultural imports from Saint-Domingue, and several million indirectly depended upon trade from the colony to maintain their standard of living. Saint-Domingue was the most profitable French colony in the world, indeed one of the most profitable of all the European colonies in the 18th century.

Slavery sustained sugar production under harsh conditions; diseases such as malaria (brought from Africa) and yellow fever caused high mortality, thriving in the tropical Caribbean climate. In 1787 alone, the French imported about 20,000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue, while the British imported about 38,000 slaves total to all of their Caribbean colonies. The death rate from yellow fever was such that at least 50% of the slaves from Africa died within a year of arriving, so while the white planters preferred to work their slaves as hard as possible, providing them only the bare minimum of food and shelter, they calculated that it was better to get the most work out of their slaves with the lowest expense possible, since they were probably going to die of yellow fever anyway. The death rate was so high that polyandry—one woman being married to several men at the same time—developed as a common form of marriage among the slaves. As slaves had no legal rights, rape by planters, their unmarried sons, or overseers was a common occurrence on the plantations.

===Demographics===
The largest sugar plantations and concentrations of slaves were in the north of the island, and whites lived in fear of slave rebellion. Even by the standards of the Caribbean, French slave masters were extremely cruel in their treatment of slaves. They used the threat and acts of physical violence to maintain control and suppress efforts at rebellion. When slaves left the plantations or disobeyed their masters, they were subject to whipping or to more extreme torture such as castration or burning, the punishment being both a personal lesson and a warning for other slaves. King Louis XIV of France passed the &quot;Code Noir&quot; in 1685 in an attempt to regulate such violence and the treatment of slaves in general in the colony, but masters openly and consistently broke the code. During the 18th century, local legislation reversed parts of it.

In 1758, the planters began passing legislation restricting the rights of other groups of people until a rigid caste system was defined. Most historians classify the people of the era into three groups:

The first group were white colonists, or &quot;les blancs&quot;. This group was generally subdivided into the plantation owners and a lower class of whites who often served as overseers or day laborers, as well as artisans and shopkeepers.

The second group were free people of color, or &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;, who were usually mixed-race (sometimes referred to as mulattoes), being of both African and French descent. These &quot;gens de couleur&quot; tended to be educated and literate, and the men often served in the army or as administrators on plantations. Many were children of white planters and enslaved mothers, or free women of color. Others had purchased their freedom from their owners through the sale of their own produce or artistic works. They often received education or artisan training, and sometimes inherited freedom or property from their fathers. Some &quot;gens de couleur&quot; owned and operated their own plantations and became slave owners.

The third group, outnumbering the others by a ratio of ten to one, was made up of mostly African-born slaves. A high rate of mortality among them meant that planters continually had to import new slaves. This kept their culture more African and separate from other people on the island. Many plantations had large concentrations of slaves from a particular region of Africa, and it was therefore somewhat easier for these groups to maintain elements of their culture, religion, and language. This also separated new slaves from Africa from creoles (slaves born in the colony), who already had kin networks and often had more prestigious roles on plantations and more opportunities for emancipation. Most slaves spoke a &quot;patois&quot; of the French language known as Haitian Creole, which was also used by island-born mulattoes and whites for communication with the workers.

The majority of the slaves were Yoruba from what is now modern Nigeria, Fon from what is now Benin, and Kongo from the Kingdom of Kongo in what is now modern northern Angola and the western Congo. The Kongolese at 40% were the largest of the African ethnic groups represented amongst the slaves. The slaves developed their own religion, a syncretic mixture of Catholicism and West African religions known as Vodou, usually called &quot;voodoo&quot; in English. This belief system implicitly rejected the Africans&#x27; status as slaves.

===Social conflict===
Saint-Domingue was a society seething with hatred, with white colonists and black slaves frequently coming into violent conflict. The French historian Paul Fregosi wrote:

Many of these conflicts involved slaves who had escaped the plantations. Many runaway slaves—called maroons—hid on the margins of large plantations, living off the land and what they could steal from their former masters. Others fled to towns, to blend in with urban slaves and freed blacks who often migrated to those areas for work. If caught, these runaway slaves would be severely and violently punished. However, some masters tolerated petit marronages, or short-term absences from plantations, knowing these allowed release of tensions.

The larger groups of runaway slaves who lived in the hillside woods away from white control often conducted violent raids on the island&#x27;s sugar and coffee plantations. Although the numbers in these bands grew large (sometimes into the thousands), they generally lacked the leadership and strategy to accomplish large-scale objectives. The first effective maroon leader to emerge was the charismatic Haitian Vodou priest François Mackandal, who inspired his people by drawing on African traditions and religions. He united the maroon bands and established a network of secret organizations among plantation slaves, leading a rebellion from 1751 through 1757. Although Mackandal was captured by the French and burned at the stake in 1758, large armed maroon bands persisted in raids and harassment after his death.

===Slavery in Enlightenment thought===
French writer Guillaume Raynal attacked slavery in his history of European colonization. He warned, &quot;the Africans only want a chief, sufficiently courageous, to lead them on to vengeance and slaughter.&quot; Raynal&#x27;s Enlightenment philosophy went deeper than a prediction and reflected many similar philosophies, including those of Rousseau and Diderot. Raynal&#x27;s admonition was written thirteen years before the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which highlighted freedom and liberty but did not abolish slavery.

In addition to Raynal&#x27;s influence, Toussaint Louverture, a free black who was familiar with Enlightenment ideas within the context of European colonialism, would become a key &quot;enlightened actor&quot; in the Haitian Revolution. Enlightened thought divided the world into &quot;enlightened leaders&quot; and &quot;ignorant masses.&quot; Louverture sought to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few by striking a balance between Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint-Domingue. Louverture wrote a constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars prior to the French Revolution. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, he exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language,

Like Louverture, Jean-Baptiste Belley was an active participant in the insurrection. The portrait of Belley by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies, creating a stark dichotomy between the refinement of Enlightenment thought and the reality of the situation in Saint-Domingue, through the bust of Raynal and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet&#x27;s portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject&#x27;s sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony&#x27;s attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.

==Situation in 1789==
===Social stratification===
In 1789, Saint-Domingue produced 60% of the world&#x27;s coffee and 40% of the sugar imported by France and Britain. The colony was not only the most profitable possession of the French colonial empire, but it was the wealthiest and most prosperous colony in the Caribbean.

The colony&#x27;s white population numbered 40,000; mulattoes and free blacks, 28,000; and black slaves, an estimated 452,000. This was almost half the total slave population in the Caribbean, estimated at one million that year. Enslaved blacks, regarded as the lowest class of colonial society, outnumbered whites and free people of color by a margin of almost eight to one.

Two-thirds of the slaves were African born, and they tended to be less submissive than those born in the Americas and raised in slave societies. The death rate in the Caribbean exceeded the birth rate, so imports of enslaved Africans were necessary to maintain the numbers required to work the plantations. The slave population declined at an annual rate of two to five percent, due to overwork, inadequate food and shelter, insufficient clothing and medical care, and an imbalance between the sexes, with more men than women. Some slaves were of a creole elite class of urban slaves and domestics, who worked as cooks, personal servants and artisans around the plantation house. This relatively privileged class was chiefly born in the Americas, while the under-class born in Africa labored hard, and often under abusive and brutal conditions.

Among Saint-Domingue&#x27;s 40,000 white colonists, European-born Frenchmen monopolized administrative posts. The sugar planters, or &quot;grands blancs&quot; (literally, &quot;big whites&quot;), were chiefly minor aristocrats. Most returned to France as soon as possible, hoping to avoid the dreaded yellow fever, which regularly swept the colony. The lower-class whites, &quot;petits blancs&quot; (literally &quot;small whites&quot;), included artisans, shopkeepers, slave dealers, overseers, and day laborers.

Saint-Domingue&#x27;s free people of color, or &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;, numbered more than 28,000. Around that time, colonial legislations, concerned with this growing and strengthening population, passed discriminatory laws that required these freedmen to wear distinctive clothing and limited where they could live. These laws also barred them from occupying many public offices. Many freedmen were also artisans and overseers, or domestic servants in the plantation houses. Le Cap Français (Le Cap), a northern port, had a large population of free people of color, including freed slaves. These men would become important leaders in the slave rebellion and later revolution.

===Regional conflicts===
Saint-Domingue&#x27;s Northern province was the center of shipping and trading, and had the largest population of &quot;grands blancs&quot;. The Plaine-du-Nord on the northern shore of Saint-Domingue was the most fertile area, having the largest sugar plantations and therefore the most slaves. It was the area of greatest economic importance, especially as most of the colony&#x27;s trade went through these ports. The largest and busiest port was Le Cap, the former capital of Saint-Domingue. Enslaved Africans in this region lived in large groups of workers in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by the high mountain range known as the &quot;Massif du Nord&quot;.

The Western province, however, grew significantly after the colonial capital was moved to Port-au-Prince in 1751, becoming increasingly wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. The Southern province lagged in population and wealth because it was geographically separated from the rest of the colony. However, this isolation allowed freed slaves to find profit in trade with Jamaica, and they gained power and wealth here. In addition to these interregional tensions, there were conflicts between proponents of independence, those loyal to France, and allies of Britain and Spain—who coveted control of the valuable colony.

==Effects of the French Revolution==

After the establishment of the French First Republic, the National Assembly made radical changes to French laws and, on 26 August 1789, published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, declaring all men free and equal. The Declaration was ambiguous as to whether this equality applied to women, slaves, or citizens of the colonies, and thus influenced the desire for freedom and equality in Saint-Domingue. White planters saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow them to take control of the island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth and power. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the new French republic, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their stated ideology.

The African population on the island began to hear of the agitation for independence by the planters, who had resented France&#x27;s limitations on the island&#x27;s foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as they understood that if Saint-Domingue&#x27;s independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The planters would be free to operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.

Saint-Domingue&#x27;s free people of color, most notably Julien Raimond, had been actively appealing to France for full civil equality with whites since the 1780s. Raimond used the French Revolution to make this the major colonial issue before the National Assembly. In October 1790, another wealthy free man of color, Vincent Ogé, demanded the right to vote under the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. When the colonial governor refused, Ogé led a brief 300-man insurgency in the area around Le Cap, fighting to end racial discrimination in the area. He was captured in early 1791, and brutally executed by being &quot;broken on the wheel&quot; before being beheaded. While Ogé was not fighting against slavery, his treatment was cited by later slave rebels as one of the factors in their decision to rise up in August 1791 and resist treaties with the colonists. The conflict up to this point was between factions of whites, and between whites and free blacks. Enslaved blacks watched from the sidelines.

Leading 18th-century French writer Count Mirabeau had once said the Saint-Domingue whites &quot;slept at the foot of Vesuvius&quot;, suggesting the grave threat they faced should the majority of slaves launch a sustained major uprising.

==1791 slave rebellion==


===Onset of the revolution===
Guillaume Raynal attacked slavery in the 1780 edition of his history of European colonization. He also predicted a general slave revolt in the colonies, saying that there were signs of &quot;the impending storm&quot;. One such sign was the action of the French revolutionary government to grant citizenship to wealthy free people of color in May 1791. Since white planters refused to comply with this decision, within two months isolated fighting broke out between the former slaves and the whites. This added to the tense climate between slaves and &quot;grands blancs&quot;.

Raynal&#x27;s prediction came true on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint-Domingue rose in revolt; thousands of slaves attended a secret vodou ceremony as a tropical storm came in — the lightning and the thunder were taken as auspicious omens — and later that night, the slaves began to kill their masters and plunged the colony into civil war. The signal to begin the revolt had been given by Dutty Boukman, a high priest of vodou and leader of the Maroon slaves, and Cecile Fatiman during a religious ceremony at Bois Caïman on the night of 14 August. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. Whites kept control of only a few isolated, fortified camps. The slaves sought revenge on their masters through &quot;pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and death&quot;. The long years of oppression by the planters had left many blacks with a hatred of all whites, and the revolt was marked by extreme violence from the very start. The masters and mistresses were dragged from their beds to be killed, and the heads of French children were placed on pikes that were carried at the front of the rebel columns. In the south, beginning in September, thirteen thousand slaves and rebels led by Romaine-la-Prophétesse, based in Trou Coffy, took supplies from and burned plantations, freed slaves, and occupied (and burned) the area&#x27;s two major cities, Léogâne and Jacmel.

The planters had long feared such a revolt, and were well armed with some defensive preparations. But within weeks, the number of slaves who joined the revolt in the north reached 100,000. Within the next two months, as the violence escalated, the slaves killed 4,000 whites and burned or destroyed 180 sugar plantations and hundreds of coffee and indigo plantations. At least 900 coffee plantations were destroyed, and the total damage inflicted over the next two weeks amounted to 2 million francs. In September 1791, the surviving whites organized into militias and struck back, killing about 15,000 blacks.

Though demanding freedom from slavery, the rebels did not demand independence from France at this point. Most of the rebel leaders professed to be fighting for the king of France, who they believed had issued a decree freeing the slaves, which had been suppressed by the colonial governor. As such, they were demanding their rights as Frenchmen which had been granted by the king.

By 1792, slave rebels controlled a third of Saint-Domingue. The success of the rebellion caused the National Assembly to realize it was facing an ominous situation. The Assembly granted civil and political rights to free men of color in the colonies in March 1792. Countries throughout Europe, as well as the United States, were shocked by the decision, but the Assembly was determined to stop the revolt. Apart from granting rights to free people of color, the Assembly dispatched 6,000 French soldiers to the island. A new governor sent by Paris, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, abolished slavery in the Northern Province and had hostile relations with the planters, whom he saw as royalists. The same month, a coalition of whites and conservative free blacks and forces under French &quot;commissaire nationale&quot; Edmond de Saint-Léger put down the Trou Coffy uprising in the south, after André Rigaud, then based near Port-au-Prince, declined to ally with them.

===Britain and Spain enter the conflict===
Meanwhile, in 1793, France declared war on Great Britain. The &quot;grands blancs&quot; in Saint-Domingue, unhappy with Sonthonax, arranged with Britain to declare British sovereignty over the colony, believing that the British would maintain slavery. The British prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, believed that the success of the slave revolt in Saint-Domingue would inspire insurrections in the British Caribbean colonies. He further thought that taking Saint-Domingue, the richest of the French colonies, would be a useful bargaining chip in eventual peace negotiations with France, and in the interim, occupying Saint-Domingue would mean diverting its great wealth into the British treasury. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was Pitt&#x27;s Secretary of State for War, instructed Sir Adam Williamson, the lieutenant-governor of the Colony of Jamaica, to sign an agreement with representatives of the French colonists that promised to restore the Ancien Régime, slavery and discrimination against mixed-race colonists, a move that drew criticism from abolitionists William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson. The troops who came to Saint-Domingue from Britain had an extremely low survival rate, often dying to diseases such as yellow fever. The British government would send less trained adolescents to maintain strong regiments. The incompetence of the new soldiers, combined with the ravaging of disease upon the army, led to a very unsuccessful campaign in Saint-Domingue. The American journalist James Perry notes that the great irony of the British campaign in Saint-Domingue was that it ended as a complete debacle, costing the British treasury millions of pounds and the British military thousands upon thousands of dead, all for nothing.

Spain, which controlled the rest of the island of Hispaniola (Santo Domingo), also joined the conflict and fought with Britain against France. The proportion of slaves was not as high in the Spanish portion of the island. Spanish forces invaded Saint-Domingue and were joined by the rebels. For most of the conflict, the British and Spanish supplied the rebels with food, ammunition, arms, medicine, naval support, and military advisors. By August 1793, there were only 3,500 French soldiers on the island. On 20 September 1793, about 600 British soldiers from Jamaica landed at Jérémie to be greeted with shouts of, &quot;Vivent les Anglais!&quot; from the French population. On 22 September 1793, Mole St. Nicolas, the main French naval base in Saint-Domingue, surrendered to the Royal Navy peacefully. However, everywhere the British went, they restored slavery, which made them hated by the mass of common people.

===French declare slavery abolished===
To prevent military disaster, and secure the colony for republican France as opposed to Britain, Spain, and French royalists, separately or in combination, the French commissioners Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel offered freedom to the slaves who would agree to fight alongside them. Then, under pressure, they gradually emancipated all the slaves of the colony. On 29 August 1793, Sonthonax proclaimed the abolition of slavery in the northern province. On 31 October, Étienne Polverel did the same in the other two western and southern provinces.

Sonthonax sent three of his deputies, namely the colonist Louis Duffay, the free black army officer Jean-Baptiste Belley and a free man of color, Jean-Baptiste Mills, to seek the National Convention&#x27;s endorsement for the emancipation of slaves near the end of January 1794. On 4 February, Dufay gave a speech to the convention arguing that abolishing slavery was the only way to keep the colony in control of the French, and that former slaves would willingly work to restore the colony. The convention deputies agreed and made the dramatic decree that &quot;slavery of the blacks is abolished in all the colonies; consequently, it decrees that all men living in the colonies, without distinction of color, are French citizens and enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the constitution&quot;.

The National Convention abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies, and granted civil and political rights to all black men in the colonies. The French constitutions of 1793 and 1795 both included the abolition of slavery. The constitution of 1793 never went into effect, but that of 1795 did; it lasted until it was replaced by the consular and imperial constitutions under Napoleon Bonaparte. Despite racial tensions in Saint-Domingue, the French revolutionary government at the time welcomed abolition with a show of idealism and optimism. The emancipation of slaves was viewed as an example of liberty for other countries, much as the American Revolution was meant to serve as the first of many liberation movements. Georges Danton, one of the Frenchmen present at the meeting of the National Convention, expressed this sentiment:

Representatives of the French people, until now our decrees of liberty have been selfish, and only for ourselves. But today we proclaim it to the universe, and generations to come will glory in this decree; we are proclaiming universal liberty ... We are working for future generations; let us launch liberty into the colonies; the English are dead, today. 

In nationalistic terms, the abolition of slavery also served as a moral triumph of France over England, as seen in the latter half of the above quote. Yet Toussaint Louverture did not stop working with the Spanish Army until sometime later, as he was suspicious of the French.

The British force that landed in Saint-Domingue in 1793 was too small to conquer the colony, being capable only of holding only few coastal enclaves. The French planters were disappointed as they had hoped to regain power; Sonthonax was relieved, as he had twice refused ultimatums from Commodore John Ford to surrender Port-au-Prince. In the meantime, a Spanish force under Captain-General Joaquín García y Moreno had marched into the Northern Province. Louverture, the ablest of the Haitian generals, had joined the Spanish, accepting an officer&#x27;s commission in the Spanish Army and being made a knight in the Order of St. Isabella.

The main British force for the conquest of Saint-Domingue under General Charles Grey, nicknamed &quot;No-flint Grey&quot;, and Admiral Sir John Jervis set sail from Portsmouth on 26 November 1793, which was in defiance of the well-known rule that the only time that one could campaign in the West Indies was from September to November, when the mosquitoes that carried malaria and yellow fever were scarce. After arriving in the West Indies in February 1794, Grey chose to conquer Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Guadeloupe. Troops under the command of John Whyte did not arrive in Saint-Domingue until 19 May 1794. Rather than attacking the main French bases at Le Cap and Port-de-Paix, Whyte chose to march towards Port-au-Prince, whose harbour was reported to have forty-five ships loaded with sugar. Whyte took Port-au-Prince, but Sonthonax and the French forces were allowed to leave in exchange for not burning the sugar-loaded ships. By May 1794, the French forces were severed in two by Toussaint, with Sonthonax commanding in the north and André Rigaud leading in the south.

===Spanish depart Saint Domingue===
In May 1794, Toussaint suddenly joined the French and turned against the Spanish, ambushing his allies as they emerged from attending mass in a church at San Raphael on 6 May 1794. The Haitians soon expelled the Spanish from Saint-Domingue. Toussaint proved to be forgiving of the whites, insisting that he was fighting to assert the rights of the slaves as black French people to be free. He said he did not seek independence from France, and urged the surviving whites, including the former slave masters, to stay and work with him in rebuilding Saint-Domingue.

Rigaud had checked the British in the south, taking the town of Léogâne by storm and driving the British back to Port-au-Prince. During the course of 1794, most of the British forces were killed by yellow fever, the dreaded &quot;black vomit&quot; as the British called it. Within two months of arriving in Saint-Domingue, the British lost 40 officers and 600 men to yellow fever. Of Grey&#x27;s 7,000 men, about 5,000 died of yellow fever while the Royal Navy reported losing &quot;forty-six masters and eleven hundred men dead, chiefly of yellow fever&quot;. The British historian Sir John Fortescue wrote, &quot;It is probably beneath the mark to say that twelve thousand Englishmen were buried in the West Indies in 1794&quot;. Rigaud failed in attempt to retake Port-au-Prince, but on Christmas Day 1794, he stormed and retook Tiburon in a surprise attack. The British lost about 300 soldiers, and Rigaud&#x27;s forces took no prisoners, executing any British soldier or sailor who surrendered.

===British &quot;great push&quot;===
At this point, Pitt decided to launch what he called &quot;the great push&quot; to conquer Saint-Domingue and the rest of the French West Indies, sending out the largest expedition Britain had yet mounted in its history, a force of about 30,000 men to be carried in 200 ships. Fortescue wrote that the aim of the British in the first expedition had been to destroy &quot;the power of France in these pestilent islands ... only to discover when it was too late, that they practically destroyed the British army&quot;. By this point, it was well known that service in the West Indies was virtually a death sentence. In Dublin and Cork, soldiers from the 104th, 105th, 111th, and 112th regiments rioted when they learned that they were being sent to Saint-Domingue. The fleet for the &quot;great push&quot; left Portsmouth on 16 November 1795 and was wrecked by a storm, before sending out again on 9 December. The overall forces in St Domingue was at that time under the command of the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, Sir Adam Williamson. He was optimistically given the title &quot;Governor of St Domingue&quot;, and among his British forces were Jamaican &quot;Black Shot&quot; militias.

General Ralph Abercromby, the commander of the forces committed to the &quot;great push&quot;, hesitated over which island to attack when he arrived in Barbados on 17 March 1796. He dispatched a force under Major General Gordon Forbes to Port-au-Prince. Forbes&#x27;s attempt to take the French-held city of Léogâne ended in disaster. The French had built a deep defensive ditch with palisades and Forbes had neglected to bring along heavy artillery. The French commander, the mulatto General Alexandre Pétion, proved to be an excellent artilleryman, who used the guns of his fort to sink two of the three ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hyde Parker in the harbour, before turning his guns to the British forces; a French sortie led to a rout of the British, and Forbes retreated back to Port-au-Prince. As more ships arrived with British troops, more soldiers died of yellow fever. By 1 June 1796, of the 1,000 from the 66th Regiment, only 198 had not been infected with yellow fever; and of the 1,000 men of the 69th Regiment, only 515 were not infected with yellow fever. Abercromby predicted that at the current rate of yellow fever infection, all of the men from the two regiments were dead by November. Ultimately, 10,000 British soldiers arrived in Saint Domingue by June, but aside from some skirmishing near Bombarde, the British remained in Port-au-Prince and other coastal enclaves, while yellow fever continued to kill them all off. The government attracted criticism in the House of Commons about the mounting costs of the expedition to Saint-Domingue. In February 1797, General John Graves Simcoe arrived to replace Forbes with orders to pull back the British forces to Port-au-Prince. As the human and financial costs of the expedition mounted, people in Britain demanded a withdrawal from Saint-Domingue, which was devouring money and soldiers, while failing to produce the expected profits.

On 11 April 1797, Colonel Thomas Maitland of the 62nd Regiment of Foot landed in Port-au-Prince, and wrote in a letter to his brother that British forces in Saint-Domingue had been &quot;annihilated&quot; by the yellow fever. Service in Saint-Domingue was extremely unpopular in the British Army owing to the terrible death toll caused by yellow fever. One British officer wrote of his horror of seeing his friends &quot;drowned in their own blood&quot; while &quot;some died raving Mad&quot;. Simcoe used the new British troops to push back the Haitians under Toussaint, but in a counter-offensive, Toussaint and Rigaud stopped the offensive. Toussaint retook the fortress at Mirebalais. On 7 June 1797, Toussaint attacked Fort Churchill in an assault that was as noted for its professionalism as for its ferocity. Under a storm of artillery, the Haitians placed ladders on the walls and were driven back four times, with heavy losses. Even though Toussaint had been repulsed, the British were astonished that he had turned a group of former slaves with no military experience into troops whose skills were the equal of a European army.

===British withdrawal===
In July 1797, Simcoe and Maitland sailed to London to advise a total withdrawal from Saint-Domingue. In March 1798 Maitland returned with a mandate to withdraw, at least from Port-au-Prince. On 10 May 1798, Maitland met with Toussaint to agree to an armistice, and on 18 May the British left Port-au-Prince. The British forces were reduced to only holding the western peninsular towns of Mole St Nicholas in the north and Jeremie in the south. The new governor of Jamaica, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, urged Maitland not to withdraw from Mole St Nicholas. However, Toussaint sent a message to Balcarres, warning him that if he persisted, to remember that Jamaica was not far from St Domingue, and could be invaded.

Maitland knew that his forces could not defeat Toussaint, and that he had to take action to protect Jamaica from invasion. British morale had collapsed with the news that Toussaint had taken Port-au-Prince, and Maitland decided to abandon all of Saint-Domingue, writing that the expedition had become such a complete disaster that withdrawal was the only sensible thing to do, even though he did not have the authority to do so. On 31 August, Maitland and Toussaint signed an agreement whereby in exchange for the British pulling out of all of Saint-Domingue, Toussaint promised to not support any slave revolts in Jamaica. Rigaud took control of Jeremie without any cost to his forces, as Maitland withdrew his southern forces to Jamaica. In the end of 1798, Maitland withdrew the last of his forces from Mole St Nicholas, as Toussaint took command of the fortress. Maitland disbanded his &quot;Black Shot&quot; troops and left them in Saint-Domingue, fearing they might return to Jamaica and start a slave rebellion. Many of them joined Toussaint&#x27;s army.

===Toussaint consolidates control===
After the departure of the British, Toussaint turned his attention to Rigaud, who was conspiring against him in the south of Saint Domingue. In June 1799, Rigaud initiated the War of Knives against Toussaint&#x27;s rule, sending a brutal offensive at Petit-Goâve and Grand-Goâve. Taking no prisoners, Rigaud&#x27;s predominantly mulatto forces put blacks and whites to the sword. Though the United States was hostile towards Toussaint, the U.S. Navy agreed to support Toussaint&#x27;s forces with the frigate USS &quot;General Greene&quot;, commanded by Captain Christopher Perry, providing fire support to the blacks as Toussaint laid siege to the city of Jacmel, held by mulatto forces under the command of Rigaud. To the United States, Rigaud&#x27;s ties to France represented a threat to American commerce. On 11 March 1800, Toussaint took Jacmel and Rigaud fled on the French schooner &quot;La Diana&quot;. Though Toussaint maintained he was still loyal to France, to all intents and purposes, he ruled Saint Domingue as its dictator.

==Leadership of Louverture==
===Toussaint Louverture===
Toussaint Louverture, although a self-educated former domestic slave, was one of the most successful black commanders. Like Jean François and Biassou, he initially fought for the Spanish crown. After the British had invaded Saint-Domingue, Louverture decided to fight for the French if they would agree to free all the slaves. Sonthonax had proclaimed an end to slavery on 29 August 1792. Louverture worked with a French general, Étienne Laveaux, to ensure that all slaves would be freed. Louverture abandoned the Spanish Army in the east and brought his forces over to the French side on 6 May 1794 after the Spanish refused to take steps to end slavery.

Under the military leadership of Toussaint, the former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelled the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Having made himself master of the island, however, Toussaint did not wish to surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals, including: the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French white man who gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; André Rigaud, a free man of color who fought to keep control of the South in the War of Knives; and Comte d&#x27;Hédouville, who forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before escaping to France. Louverture led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo (December 1800), and freed the slaves there on 3 January 1801.

In 1801, Louverture issued a constitution for Saint-Domingue that decreed he would be governor-for-life and called for black autonomy and a sovereign black state. In response, Napoleon Bonaparte dispatched a large expeditionary force of French soldiers and warships to the island, led by Bonaparte&#x27;s brother-in-law Charles Leclerc, to restore French rule. They were under secret instructions to restore slavery, at least in the formerly Spanish-held part of the island. Bonaparte ordered that Toussaint was to be treated with respect until the French forces were established; once that was done, Toussaint was to be summoned to Le Cap and arrested; if he failed to show, Leclerc was to wage &quot;a war to the death&quot; with no mercy and all of Toussaint&#x27;s followers to be shot when captured. Once that was completed, slavery would be ultimately restored. The numerous French soldiers were accompanied by mulatto troops led by Alexandre Pétion and André Rigaud, mulatto leaders who had been defeated by Toussaint three years earlier.

===Napoleon invades Haiti===
The French arrived on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian commander Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc to turn over the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: &quot;Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for you, since it has been only too well earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty of your fellow citizens&quot;. When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: &quot;General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic&quot;. Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited Saint-Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: &quot;At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled...This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country&quot;.

===Haitian resistance and scorched-earth tactics===
In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French using scorched-earth: &quot;Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweat must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve&quot;. Dessalines never received the letter as he had already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed Léogâne. The Haitians burned down Léogâne and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines&#x27;s actions at Léogâne: &quot;Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns&quot;. The French had been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves, as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites, and were stunned to learn how much the Haitians hated them for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of Léogâne wrote: &quot;They heaped up bodies&quot; which &quot;still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces&quot;.

Leclerc ordered four French columns to march on Gonaives, which was the main Haitian base. One of the French columns was commanded by General Donatien de Rochambeau, a proud white supremacist and a supporter of slavery who detested the Haitians for wanting to be free. Toussaint tried to stop Rochambeau at Ravine-à-Couleuvre, a very narrow gully up in the mountains that the Haitians had filled with chopped down trees. In the ensuring Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres, after six hours of fierce hand-to-hand fighting with no quarter given on either side, the French finally broke through, albeit with heavy losses. During the battle, Toussaint personally took part in the fighting to lead his men in charges against the French. After losing 800 men, Toussaint ordered a retreat.

===Crête-à-Pierrot fortress===
The Haitians next tried to stop the French at a British-built fort up in the mountains called Crête-à-Pierrot, a battle that is remembered as a national epic in Haiti. While Toussaint took to the field, he left Dessalines in command of Crête-à-Pierrot, who from his fastness could see three French columns converging on the fort. Dessalines appeared before his men standing atop of a barrel of gunpowder, holding a lit torch, saying: &quot;We are going to be attacked, and if the French put their feet in here, I shall blow everything up&quot;, leading his men to reply &quot;We shall die for liberty!&quot;. The first of the French columns to appear before the fort was commanded by General Jean Boudet, whose men were harassed by skirmishers until they reached a deep ditch the Haitians had dug. As the French tried to cross the ditch, Dessalines ordered his men who were hiding to come out and open fire, hitting the French with a tremendous volley of artillery and musket fire, inflicting heavy losses on the attackers. General Boudet himself was wounded and as the French dead and wounded started to pile up in the ditch, the French retreated. The next French commander who tried to assault the ditch was General Charles Dugua, joined shortly afterwards by the column commanded by Leclerc. All of the French assaults ended in total failure, and after the failure of their last attack, the Haitians charged the French, cutting down any Frenchmen. General Dugua was killed, Leclerc was wounded and the French lost about 800 dead. The final French column to arrive was the one commanded by Rochambeau, who brought along heavy artillery that knocked out the Haitian artillery, though his attempt to storm the ditch also ended in failure with about 300 of his men killed. Over the following days, the French kept on bombarding and assaulting the fort, only to be repulsed every time while the Haitians defiantly sang songs of the French Revolution, celebrating the right of all men to be equal and free. The Haitian psychological warfare was successful with many French soldiers asking why they were fighting to enslave the Haitians, who were only asserting the rights promised by the Revolution to make all men free. Despite Bonaparte&#x27;s attempt to keep his intention to restore slavery a secret, it was widely believed by both sides that was why the French had returned to Haiti, as a sugar plantation could only be profitable with slave labour. Finally after twenty days of siege with food and ammunition running out, Dessalines ordered his men to abandon the fort on the night of 24 March 1802 and the Haitians slipped out of the fort to fight another day. Even Rochambeau, who hated all blacks was forced to admit in a report: &quot;Their retreat—this miraculous retreat from our trap—was an incredible feat of arms&quot;. The French had won, but they had lost 2,000 dead against an opponent whom they held in contempt on racial grounds, believing all blacks to be stupid and cowardly, and furthermore, that it was shortages of food and ammunition that forced the Haitians to retreat, not because of any feats of arms by the French army.

After the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot, the Haitians abandoned conventional warfare and reverted to guerrilla tactics, making the French hold over much of the countryside from Le Cap down to the Artibonite valley very tenuous. With March, the rainy season came to Saint-Domingue, and as stagnant water collected, the mosquitoes began to breed, leading to yet another outbreak of yellow fever. By the end of March, 5,000 French soldiers had died of yellow fever and another 5,000 were hospitalized with yellow fever, leading to a worried Leclerc to write in his diary: &quot;The rainy season has arrived. My troops are exhausted with fatigue and sickness&quot;.

===Capture of Toussaint===
On 25 April 1802, the situation suddenly changed when Christophe defected, along with much of the Haitian Army, to the French. Louverture was promised his freedom if he agreed to integrate his remaining troops into the French army. Louverture agreed to this on 6 May 1802. Just what motivated Toussaint to give up the fight has been the subject of much debate with most probable explanation being that he was just tired after 11 years of war. Under the terms of surrender, Leclerc gave his solemn word that slavery would not be restored in Saint-Domingue, that blacks could be officers in the French Army, and that the Haitian Army would be allowed to integrate into the French Army. Leclerc also gave Toussaint a plantation at Ennery. Toussaint was later deceived, seized by the French and shipped to France. He died months later in prison at Fort-de-Joux in the Jura Mountains. Shortly afterwards, the ferocious Dessalines rode into Le Cap to submit to France and was rewarded by being made the governor of Saint-Marc, a place that Dessalines ruled with his customary cruelty. However, the surrender of Christophe, Toussaint, and Dessalines did not mean the end of Haitian resistance. Throughout the countryside, guerrilla warfare continued and the French staged mass executions via firing squads, hanging, and drowning Haitians in bags. Rochambeau invented a new means of mass execution, which he called &quot;fumigational-sulphurous baths&quot;: killing hundreds of Haitians in the holds of ships by burning sulphur to make sulphur dioxide to gas them.

==War of independence==
===Rebellion against reimposition of slavery===

For a few months, the island was quiet under Napoleonic rule. But when it became apparent that the French intended to re-establish slavery (because they had nearly done so on Guadeloupe), black cultivators revolted in the summer of 1802. Yellow fever had decimated the French; by the middle of July 1802, the French lost about 10,000 dead to yellow fever. By September, Leclerc wrote in his diary that he had only 8,000 fit men left as yellow fever had killed the others.

In 1802, Napoleon added a Polish legion of around 5,200 to the forces sent to Saint-Domingue to fight off the slave rebellion. However, the Poles were told that there was a revolt of prisoners in Saint-Domingue. Upon arrival and the first fights, the Polish soldiers soon discovered that what was actually taking place in the colony was a rebellion of slaves fighting off their French masters for their freedom.
During this time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the occupying forces of Russia, Prussia, and Austria that began in 1772. Many Poles believed that if they fought for France, Bonaparte would reward them by restoring Polish independence, which had been ended with the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their freedom and independence by organizing an uprising. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their opponents, to eventually turn on the French army and join the Haitian slaves. Polish soldiers participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, contributing to the establishment of the world&#x27;s first free black republic and the first independent Caribbean state.

Haiti&#x27;s first head of state Jean-Jacques Dessalines called Polish people &quot;the White Negroes of Europe&quot;, which was then regarded a great honor, as it meant brotherhood between Poles and Haitians. Many years later François Duvalier, the president of Haiti who was known for his black nationalist and Pan-African views, used the same concept of &quot;European white negroes&quot; while referring to Polish people and glorifying their patriotism.
After Haiti gained its independence, the Poles acquired Haitian citizenship for their loyalty and support in overthrowing the French colonialists, and were called &quot;black&quot; by the Haitian constitution.

===Dessalines and Pétion join Haitian forces===
Dessalines and Pétion remained allied with France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and fought against the French. As Leclerc lay dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap to be killed by drowning in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army.

His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, killing everyone who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15,000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had been trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. (Other sources suggest the dogs may have been dogo cubanos sourced in their hundreds from Cuba rather than Jamaica.) At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned. No one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward, as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing that most of his army in Saint-Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French held only Port-au-Prince, Le Cap, and Les Cayes, sent about 20,000 reinforcements to Rochambeau.

Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau&#x27;s atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given. The Haitians burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied them to a board and sawed them into two.

===War between France and Britain===

With Napoleon&#x27;s inability to send the requested massive reinforcements after the outbreak of war on 18 May 1803 with the British, the Royal Navy immediately despatched a squadron under Sir John Duckworth from Jamaica to cruise in the region, seeking to eliminate communication between the French outposts and to capture or destroy the French warships based in the colony. The Blockade of Saint-Domingue not only cut the French forces out from reinforcements and supplies from France, but also meant that the British began to supply arms to the Haitians. Trapped, engaged in a vicious race war, and with much of his army dying of yellow fever, Rochambeau fell to pieces. He lost interest in commanding his army and as James wrote, he &quot;amused himself with sexual pleasures, military balls, banquets and the amassing of a personal fortune&quot;.

The Royal Navy squadrons soon blockaded the French-held ports of Cap Français and Môle-Saint-Nicolas on the Northern coast of the French colony. In the summer of 1803, when war broke out between the United Kingdom and the French Consulate, Saint-Domingue had been almost completely overrun by Haitian forces under the command of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. In the north of the country, the French forces were isolated in the two large ports of Cap Français and Môle-Saint-Nicolas and a few smaller settlements, all supplied by a French naval force based primarily at Cap Français.

On 28 June, the squadron encountered a French convoy from Les Cayes off Môle-Saint-Nicolas, capturing one ship although the other escaped. Two days later an independently sailing French frigate was chased down and captured in the same waters. On 24 July, another British squadron intercepted the main French squadron from Cap Français, which was attempting to break past the blockade and reach France. The British, led by Commodore John Loring gave chase, but one French ship of the line and a frigate escaped. Another ship of the line was trapped against the coast and captured after coming under fire from Haitian shore batteries. The remainder of the squadron was forced to fight two more actions on their return to Europe, but did eventually reach the Spanish port of Corunna.
On 8 October 1803, the French abandoned Port-au-Prince as Rochambeau decided to concentrate what was left of his army at Le Cap. Dessalines marched into Port-au-Prince, where he was welcomed as a hero by the 100 whites who had chosen to stay behind. Dessalines thanked them all for their kindness and belief in racial equality, but then he said that the French had treated him as less than human when he was a slave, and so to avenge his mistreatment, he promptly had the 100 whites all hanged. On 3 November, the frigate HMS &quot;Blanche&quot; captured a supply schooner near Cap Français, the last hope in supplying the French forces. On 16 November 1803, Dessalines began attacking the French blockhouses outside of Le Cap. The last battle on land of the Haitian Revolution, the Battle of Vertières, occurred on 18 November 1803, near Cap-Haïtien fought between Dessalines&#x27; army and the remaining French colonial army under the Vicomte de Rochambeau; the slave rebels and freed revolutionary soldiers won the battle. By this point, Perry observed that both sides were &quot;a little mad&quot; as the pressures of the war and yellow fever had taken their toll, and both the French and the Haitians fought with a reckless courage, seeing death in battle as preferable to a slow death by yellow fever or being tortured to death by the enemy.

===Haitian victory===
Rochambeau, seeing defeat inevitable, procrastinated until the last possible moment, but eventually was forced to surrender to the British commander—by the end of the month the garrison was starving, having reached the conclusion at a council of war that surrender was the only way to escape from this &quot;place of death&quot;. Commodore Loring, however, refused the French permission to sail and agreed terms with Dessalines that permitted them to safely evacuate provided they had left the port by 1 December. On the night of 30 November 1803, 8,000 French soldiers and hundreds of white civilians boarded the British ships to take them away. One of Rochambeau&#x27;s ships was almost wrecked while leaving the harbour, but was saved by a British lieutenant acting alone, who not only rescued the 900 people on board, but also refloated the ship. At Môle-Saint-Nicolas, General Louis de Noailles refused to surrender and instead sailed to Havana, Cuba in a fleet of small vessels on 3 December, but was intercepted and mortally wounded by a Royal Navy frigate. Soon after, the few remaining French-held towns in Saint-Domingue surrendered to the Royal Navy to prevent massacres by the Haitian army. Meanwhile, Dessalines led the rebellion until its completion, when the French forces were finally defeated by the end of 1803.

On 1 January 1804, from the city of Gonaïves, Dessalines officially declared the former colony&#x27;s independence, renaming it &quot;Haiti&quot; after the indigenous Arawak name. Although he lasted from 1804 to 1806, several changes began taking place in Haiti. The independence of Haiti was a major blow to France and its colonial empire, but the French state would take several decades to recognize the loss of the colony. As the French retreated, Haiti, which had once been called the &quot;Pearl of the Antilles&quot;, the richest French colony in the world, was impoverished, as its economy was in ruins after the revolution. Haiti struggled to recover economically from the war. The Haitians had paid a high price for their freedom, losing about 200,000 dead between 1791 and 1803, and unlike the majority of the European dead, who were killed by yellow fever, the majority of the Haitian dead were the victims of violence.

==Casualties==
In the early 21st century, historian Robert L. Scheina estimated that the slave rebellion resulted in the death of 350,000 Haitians and 50,000 European troops. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of African American Politics&quot;, &quot;Between 1791 and independence in 1804 nearly 200,000 blacks died, as did thousands of mulattoes and as many as 100,000 French and British soldiers.&quot; Yellow fever caused the most deaths. Geggus points out that at least 3 of every 5 British troops sent there in 1791–1797 died of disease. There has been considerable debate over whether the number of deaths caused by disease was exaggerated.

An estimated 37,000 French soldiers were killed in action during the Haitian Revolution, exceeding the total French soldiers killed in action across various 19th-century colonial campaigns in Algeria, Mexico, Indochina, Tunisia, and West Africa, which resulted in approximately 10,000 French soldiers killed in action combined. Between 1793 and 1798, the expedition to Saint-Domingue had cost the British treasury four million pounds (in 1798 money) and 100,000 men either dead, wounded, or permanently disabled from the effects of yellow fever.

==Free republic==
On 1 January 1804, Dessalines, the new leader under the dictatorial 1805 constitution, declared Haiti a free republic in the name of the Haitian people, which was followed by the massacre of the remaining whites. His secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated, &quot;For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!&quot; Haiti was the first independent nation in Latin America, the first post-colonial independent black-led nation in the world, and the only nation whose independence was gained as part of a successful slave rebellion.

The country was damaged from years of war, its agriculture devastated, its formal commerce nonexistent. The country, therefore, had to be rebuilt. To realise this goal, Dessalines adopted the economic organisation of serfdom. He proclaimed that every citizen would belong to one of two categories, laborer or soldier. Furthermore, he proclaimed the mastery of the state over the individual and consequently ordered that all laborers would be bound to a plantation. Those that possessed skills outside of plantation work, like craftsmanship and artisans, were exempt from this ordinance. To avoid the appearance of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. His chief motivator nonetheless was production, and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations&#x27; overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Many of the workers likened the new labor system to slavery, much like Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture&#x27;s system, which caused resentment between Dessalines and his people. Workers were given a fourth of all wealth produced from their labor. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the country and in raising production levels, thus slowly rebuilding the economy.

Dessalines paid large sums of money to liberate slaves on slave ships near the Haitian coast. He paid for the expenses of the returns of the thousands of Haitian refugees that left during the revolution.

Fearing a return of French forces, Dessalines first expanded and maintained a significant military force. During his reign, nearly 10% of able-bodied men were in active service resulting in a military force of up to 37,000 men. Furthermore, Dessalines ordered the construction of massive fortifications throughout the island, like the Citadelle Laferrière, the largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere. Cities and commercial centers were moved to the interior of the country, while less important ones were kept to the coast, so they could be burnt down completely to discourage the French; many commentators believe that this over-militarization contributed to many of Haiti&#x27;s future problems. In fact, because young fit men were the most likely to be drafted into the army, the plantations were thus deprived of the workforce needed to function properly.

There was growing frustration between the workers, the elites, and Dessalines. A conspiracy led by the mulatto elites ultimately led to Dessalines&#x27; assassination and two separate sovereign states of Haiti.

== 1804 massacre of the French ==

The 1804 massacre was carried out against the remaining white population of French colonists and loyalists, both enemies and traitors of the revolution, by the black population of Haiti on the order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who declared the French as &quot;barbarians&quot;, demanding their expulsion and vengeance for their crimes. The massacre—which took place in the entire territory of Haiti—was carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804. During February and March, Dessalines traveled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. Despite his orders, the massacres were often not carried out until he personally visited the cities.

The course of the massacre showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited. Before his arrival, there were only a few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former French authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area&#x27;s French population be carried out. Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed-race, so that blame would not rest solely on the black population. Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred. Women and children were generally killed last. White women were &quot;often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death&quot;.

By the end of April 1804, some 3,000 to 5,000 people had been killed practically eradicating the country&#x27;s white population. Dessalines had specifically stated that France is &quot;the real enemy of the new nation.&quot; This allowed certain categories of whites to be excluded from massacre who had to pledge their rejection to France: the Polish soldiers who deserted from the French army; the group of German colonists of Nord-Ouest who were inhabitants before the revolution; French widows who were allowed to keep their property; select male Frenchmen; and a group of medical doctors and professionals. Reportedly, also people with connections to Haitian notables were spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men. In the 1805 constitution that declared all its citizens as &quot;black&quot;, it specifically mentions the naturalizations of German and Polish peoples enacted by the government, as being exempt from Article XII that prohibited whites (&quot;non-Haitians;&quot; foreigners) from owning land.

==Post-Revolution era==
An independent government was created in Haiti, but the country&#x27;s society remained deeply affected by patterns established under French colonial rule. As in other French colonial societies, a class of free people of color had developed after centuries of French rule here. Many planters or young unmarried men had relations with African or Afro-Caribbean women, sometimes providing for their freedom and that of their children, as well as providing for education of the mixed-race children, especially the boys. Some were sent to France for education and training, and some joined the French military. The mulattoes who returned to Saint-Domingue became the elite of the people of color. As an educated class used to the French political system, they became the elite of Haitian society after the war&#x27;s end. Many of them had used their social capital to acquire wealth, and some already owned land. Some had identified more with the French colonists than the slaves. Many of the free people of color, by contrast, were raised in French culture, had certain rights within colonial society, and generally spoke French and practiced Catholicism (with syncretic absorption of African religions.)

Following Dessaline&#x27;s assassination, another of Toussaint&#x27;s black generals, Henri Christophe, succeeded his in control of the north, while Alexandre Pétion presided over mulatto rule in the south. There were large differences in governance between Petion&#x27;s republic, and what would eventually become Christophe&#x27;s kingdom. While the southern republic did not have as much focus on economic development, and put more attention on liberal land distribution and education, the northern kingdom went on to become relatively wealthy, though wealth distribution was disputed. As a result of temporary trade agreements between Christophe, the United States, and British colonies, Christophe was able to rebuild the northern region. There were large investments in education and public works, military infrastructure, and many chateaux, the most notable being the Sans Souci palace in Milot. However, much like his predecessors, this was achieved through forced labor which ultimately led to his downfall. Contrarily, Petion was beloved by his people, but despised by his northern counterpart. A major effort by Christophe to take Port-au-Prince in mid–1812 failed. The mulattoes were harassed by a pocket of black rebellion in their rear from February 1807 to May 1819. A black leader named Goman kept alive the angry spirit of Dessalines in the southern mountains of the Grand-Anse, resisting several mulatto punitive expeditions. Finally, in 1819, the new mulatto leader, Jean-Pierre Boyer, sent six regiments into the Grand-Anse to ferret out Goman. The black rebel was trapped and shot off a 1,000-foot-high cliff. In 1820, the island nation was finally reunified when Christophe, ill and surrounded by new rebellions, killed himself. Boyer with 20,000 troops marched into Cap-Haïtien, the northern capital, shortly afterward to establish his power over all of Haiti. Not too long after, Boyer was able to secure cooperation with the general of the neighboring Spanish Haiti, and in February 1822 began a 22 year long unification with the eastern state.

=== Independence debt ===

The nascent state&#x27;s future was hobbled in 1825 when France under Charles X forced it (with French warships anchored off the coast during the negotiations) to pay 150 million gold francs in reparations to French ex-slaveholders—as a condition of French political recognition and to end the newly formed state&#x27;s political and economic isolation. By an order of 17 April 1825, the King of France renounced his rights of sovereignty over Santo Domingo, and recognized the independence of Haiti. President Jean-Pierre Boyer believed that the constant threat of a French invasion was stymieing the Haitian economy and thus felt the need to settle the matter once and for all.

Though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million francs in 1838, Haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947. The indemnity bankrupted the Haitian treasury and left the country&#x27;s government deeply impoverished, causing long-term instability. Haiti was therefore forced to take out a loan from French banks, who provided the funds for the large first installment, severely affecting Haiti&#x27;s ability to prosper.

=== Influence on other abolitionist and post-colonial movements ===
While Haiti suffered major economic setbacks during the early years of the post revolutionary era, the ideals of freedom and anti-colonialism never ceased to be part of the Haitian consciousness. Citizenship was offered to any slave or oppressed person that made it to Haiti&#x27;s shores as mandated by Dessaline&#x27;s constitution. All four of Haiti&#x27;s earlier rulers, Dessalines, Christophe, Petion, and Boyer all had programs that involved swaying African Americans to resettle there and assure their freedom. Slave boats that were captured and brought to Haiti&#x27;s shores resulted in the liberation and integration of all captives on board into Haitian society. On one occasion, President Alexandre Petion protected Jamaican slaves from re-enslavement after they escaped their plantation and landed in the southern city of Jérémie. On multiple occasions, Haiti&#x27;s leaders offered asylum to liberal revolutionaries globally. One of the more notable examples of this included Haiti&#x27;s involvement with Gran Colombia, where Dessalines and Petion both offered aid, ammunitions, and asylum to Francisco de Miranda and Simón Bolívar, who even went as far as to credit Haiti for the liberation of his country. Dessalines offered citizenship and assistance to slaves in Martinique and Guadeloupe so that they could start their own uprisings. Mexican nationalists, Francisco Javier Mina and José Joaquín de Herrera took asylum in Les Cayes and were welcomed by Petion during Mexico&#x27;s War of Independence. The Greeks later received support from President Boyer during their fight against the Ottomans.

The end of the Haitian Revolution in 1804 marked the end of French colonialism on the island. However, the social conflict cultivated under slavery continued to affect the population for years to come. Mulatto domination of politics and economics, and urban life after the revolution, created a different kind of two-caste society, as most Haitians were rural subsistence farmers. The &quot;affranchi&quot; élite, who continued to rule Haiti while the formidable Haitian army kept them in power. France continued the slavery system in French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe.

==Influence on slavery in the Americas==

Historians continue to debate the importance of the Haitian Revolution. David Geggus asks: &quot;How much of a difference did it make?&quot; A limited amount, he concludes, for slavery flourished in the western hemisphere for many more decades. In the opposing camp, African American historian W. E. B. Du Bois said that the Haitian Revolution was an economic pressure without which the British parliament would not have accepted abolitionism as readily.

Other historians say the Haitian Revolution influenced slave rebellions in the U.S. as well as in British colonies. The biggest slave revolt in U.S. history was the 1811 German Coast uprising in Louisiana. This slave rebellion was put down and the punishment the slaves received was so severe that no contemporary news reports about it exist. The neighboring revolution brought the slavery question to the forefront of U.S. politics, and though inspiring to the enslaved themselves the resulting intensification of racial divides and sectional politics ended the idealism of the Revolutionary period. The American President Thomas Jefferson—who was a slaveholder himself—refused to establish diplomatic relations with Haiti (the United States did not recognize Haiti until 1862) and imposed an economic embargo on trade with Haiti that also lasted until 1862 in an attempt to ensure the economic failure of the new republic as Jefferson wanted Haiti to fail, regarding a successful slave revolt in the West Indies as a dangerous example for American slaves.
Beginning during the slave insurrections of 1791, white refugees from Saint-Domingue fled to the United States, particularly to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, and Charleston. The immigration intensified after the journée (crisis) of 20 June 1793, and soon American families began to raise money and open up their homes to help exiles in what became the United States&#x27; first refugee crisis. While some white refugees blamed the French Revolutionary government for sparking the violence in Haiti, many supported the Republican regime and openly expressed their support of the Jacobins. There is also some historical evidence suggesting that displaying solidarity with the French Revolution was the easiest way for the refugees to earn the support and sympathy of the Americans, who had just recently lived through their own revolution. American slaveholders, in particular, commiserated with the French planters who had been forcibly removed from their plantations in Saint-Domingue. While the exiles found themselves in a peaceful situation in the United States—safe from the violence raging in both France and Haiti—their presence complicated the already precarious diplomatic relations among Britain, France, and the U.S.

Many of the whites and free people of color who left Saint-Domingue for the United States settled in southern Louisiana, adding many new members to its French-speaking, mixed-race, and black populations. The exiles causing the most alarm were the African slaves who came with their refugee owners. Some southern planters grew concerned that the presence of these slaves who had witnessed the revolution in Haiti would ignite similar revolts in the United States. Other planters, however, were confident they had the situation under control.

In 1807, Haiti was divided into two parts, the Republic of Haiti in the south, and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Land could not be privately owned; it reverted to the State through &quot;Biens Nationaux&quot; (national bonds), and no French whites could own land. The remaining French settlers were forced to leave the island. Those who refused were slaughtered. The Haitian State owned up to 90% of the land and the other 10% was leased in 5-year intervals.

Since the resistance and the murderous disease environment made it impossible for Napoleon to regain control over Haiti, he gave up hope of rebuilding a French New World empire. He decided to sell Louisiana to the U.S. The Haitian Revolution brought about two unintended consequences: the creation of a continental America and the virtual end of Napoleonic rule in the Americas.

There never again was such a large-scale slave rebellion. Napoleon reversed the French abolition of slavery in law, constitution, and practice, which had occurred between 1793 and 1801, and reinstated slavery in the French colonies in 1801–1803—which lasted until 1848.

==Relationship between the French and Haitian Revolutions==
===Reason for revolution===

The Haitian Revolution was a revolution ignited from below, by the underrepresented majority of the population. A huge majority of the supporters of the Haitian revolution were slaves and freed Africans who were severely discriminated against by colonial society and the law.

===Brutality===
Despite the idealist, rational and utopian thinking surrounding both uprisings, extreme brutality was a fundamental aspect of both uprisings. Besides initial cruelty that created the precarious conditions that bred the revolution, there was violence from both sides throughout the revolution. The period of violence during the French Revolution is known as the Reign of Terror. Waves of suspicion meant that the government rounded up and killed thousands of suspects, ranging from known aristocrats to people thought to oppose the leaders. They were killed by guillotine, &quot;breaking at the wheel&quot;, mobs and other death machines: death toll estimates range from 18,000 to 40,000. Total casualties for the French Revolution are estimated at 2 million. In the Caribbean, total casualties totaled approximately 162,000. Violence in Haiti was largely characterized by military confrontations, riots, killing of slave owners and their families, and guerrilla warfare.

===Lasting change===
The Revolution in Haiti did not wait on the Revolution in France. The call for modification of society was influenced by the revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion in history. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On 4 April 1792, the French Legislative Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Saint-Domingue. The revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent state solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France&#x27;s transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti&#x27;s influence spanned every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential revolution in history.

==Historiographical debates==
While acknowledging the cross-influences, most contemporary historians distinguish the Haitian Revolution from the French Revolution. Some also separate it from the earlier armed conflicts by free men of color who were seeking expansion of political rights for themselves, but not the abolition of slavery. These scholars show that if the agency of the enslaved blacks becomes the focus of studies, the Revolution&#x27;s opening and closing dates are certain. From this premise, the narrative began with the enslaved blacks&#x27; bid for freedom through armed struggle and concluded with their victory over slavery powers and the creation of an independent state. In April 1791, a massive black insurgency in the north of the island rose violently against the plantation system, setting a precedent of resistance to racial slavery. In cooperation with their former mulatto rivals, blacks ended the Revolution in November 1803 when they decidedly defeated the French Army at the Battle of Vertières. The French had already lost a high proportion of their troops to yellow fever and other diseases. After acknowledging defeat in Saint-Domingue, Napoleon withdrew from North America, agreeing to the Louisiana Purchase by the United States.

Although the series of events during these years is known under the name of &quot;Haitian Revolution&quot;, alternative views suggest that the entire affair was an assorted number of coincidental conflicts that ended with a fragile truce between free men of color and blacks. Historians debate whether the victorious Haitians were &quot;intrinsically [a] revolutionary force&quot;. One thing is certain: Haiti became an independent country on 1 January 1804, when the council of generals chose Jean-Jacques Dessalines to assume the office of governor-general. One of the state&#x27;s first significant documents was Dessaliness&#x27; &quot;Liberty or Death&quot; speech, which circulated broadly in the foreign press. In it, the new head of state made the case for the new nation&#x27;s objective: the permanent abolition of slavery in Haiti.

The role of women in the Haitian Revolution was for a long time given little attention by historians, but has in recent years garnered significant attention.

==Contemporary press response==
The revolution of African slaves brought many fears to colonies surrounding Haiti and the Caribbean. Prominent wealthy American slave owners, reading about the revolution, also read speculation about what might come in their own states. Anti-abolitionist critics of the revolution dubbed it &quot;the horrors of Santo Domingo&quot;. However, newspapers like the &quot;Columbian Centinel&quot; took extra steps to support the revolution, comparing it to the American Revolution. The French media also played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, with contributions that made many French upstarts quite interested in the young, passionate Toussaint&#x27;s writings of freedom.

There were many written discussions about the events in Haiti during the revolution in both France and England, however, they were generally written by anonymous authors. These texts also generally fell into two camps—one being proslavery authors who warned of a repetition of the violence of St. Domingue wherever abolition occurred; and the other being abolitionist authors who countered that white owners had sown the seeds of revolution.

However, all was not simple in the press. A top critic who significantly drove Toussaint into fear of backlash from France was Sonthonax, who was responsible for many outlooks of Haiti in the French newspapers. Yet Sonthonax was one of the few contenders who truly pushed for the independence of the African slaves and became a major factor in Toussaint&#x27;s decision of declaring independence from France.

<text>.tl is the current country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for East Timor (Timor-Leste). It is administered through the Council of Country Code Administrators (CoCCA) and second-level registration is available through resellers worldwide with no local presence requirement.

.tl complies with the ISO 3166-1 standard for the two-letter codes of the name of countries and can be used as an abbreviation in either of the country&#x27;s two official languages: &quot;Timor Lorosa&#x27;e&quot; in Tetum or &quot;Timor-Leste&quot; in Portuguese.

Registration is normally directly at second-level; one subdomain in use in the country itself is gov.tl, for government ministries. For example, the Government Portal is &quot;www.timor-leste.gov.tl&quot;.

The previous ccTLD for East Timor was .tp. This ccTLD was, according to IANA, assigned in May 1997. According to the registry, all registrants in .tp were automatically given the equivalent domains in .tl, and no further .tp registrations were accepted until its removal from the root zone in February 2015.

For several years, the .tl WHOIS information at IANA showed no sponsoring organization or registry, and the domain did not appear to work even though the country involved claimed to be transitioning to it. However, as of 30 September 2005, there is contact information in the IANA WHOIS and a registry site at nic.tl, although the site has been inactive since 2021. A WHOIS service remains accessible.

The majority of current .tl registrations are domain hacks directly at the second-level by various international entities, often with no direct connection with Timor Leste.

<text>Vital statistics is accumulated data gathered on live births, deaths, migration, fetal deaths, marriages and divorces. The most common way of collecting information on these events is through civil registration, an administrative system used by governments to record vital events which occur in their populations. Efforts to improve the quality of vital statistics will therefore be closely related to the development of civil registration systems in countries. Civil registration followed the practice of churches keeping such records since the 19th century.

This article covers mainly the US, UK and Canada, with references to global standards.

==Definitions==
A vital statistics system is defined by the United Nations &quot;as the total process of (a) collecting information by civil registration or enumeration on the frequency or occurrence of specified and defined vital events, as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and the person or persons concerned, and (b) compiling, processing, analyzing, evaluating, presenting, and disseminating these data in statistical form&quot;

Civil registration is defined by the United Nations as the&quot; continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events (live births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces) and other civil status events pertaining to the population as provided by decree, law or regulation, in accordance with the legal requirements in each country.&quot;

==History==
===United Kingdom===
Prior to the creation of the General Register Office (GRO) in 1837, there was no national system of civil registration in England and Wales. Baptisms, marriages and burials were recorded in parish registers maintained by Church of England (Anglican) clergy. However, with the great increase in nonconformity and the gradual relaxation of the laws against Catholics and other dissenters from the late 17th century, more and more baptisms, marriages and burials were going unrecorded in the registers of the Anglican Church.

The increasingly poor state of English parish registration led to numerous attempts to shore up the system in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The Marriage Act 1753 attempted to prevent &#x27;clandestine&#x27; marriages by imposing a standard form of entry for marriages, which had to be signed by both parties to the marriage and by witnesses. Additionally, except in the case of Jews and Quakers, legal marriages had to be carried out according to the rites of the Church of England. Sir George Rose&#x27;s Parochial Registers Act 1812 (52 Geo. 3. c. 146) laid down that all events had to be entered on standard entries in bound volumes. It also declared that the church registers of Nonconformists were not admissible in court as evidence of births, marriages and deaths. Only those maintained by the clergy of the Church of England could be presented in court as legal documents, and this caused considerable hardship for Nonconformists. A number of proposals were presented to Parliament to set up centralised registries for recording vital events in the 1820s but none came to fruition.

Eventually, increasing concern that the poor registration of baptisms, marriages and burials undermined property rights, by making it difficult to establish lines of descent, coupled with the complaints of Nonconformists, led to the establishment in 1833 of a parliamentary Select Committee on Parochial Registration. This took evidence on the state of the parochial system of registration, and made proposals that were eventually incorporated into the Registration Act 1836 and the Marriage Act 1836. In addition, the government wanted to survey matters such as infant mortality, fertility and literacy to bring about improvements in health and social welfare. The medical establishment advocated this because a rapidly growing population in the northern industrial towns – caused by the Industrial Revolution – had created severe overcrowding, and the links between poor living conditions and short life expectancy were now known.

The answer was the establishment of a civil registration system. It was hoped that improved registration of vital events would protect property rights through the more accurate recording of lines of descent. Civil registration would also remove the need for Nonconformists to rely upon the Church of England for registration, and provide medical data for research. As a result the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 86) was passed that ordered the civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales. This took effect from 1 July 1837. A General Register Office was set up in London and the office of Registrar General was established.

England and Wales were divided into 619 registration districts (623 from 1851), each under the supervision of a superintendent registrar. The districts were based on the recently introduced poor law unions. The registration districts were further divided into sub-districts (there could be two or more), each under the charge of registrars who were appointed locally.

The General Register Office for Scotland was created in 1854. The General Register Office (Northern Ireland) holds records from 1864 onward for what is now Northern Ireland.

==Methods==
While the number of births and deaths can be obtained by enumeration at certain points in time (e.g. censuses and surveys), civil registration collects this information on a continuous basis and is the only source that provides individuals with a legal document. For instance, the importance of birth registration as the first legal recognition of the child is emphasized in Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that &quot;the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents&quot;. United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) and a number of non-governmental organizations (Plan International, Save the Children Fund, World Vision, etc.) have particularly promoted the human rights aspects of registration, while the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) have focused more on the statistical aspects of civil registration.

Registration generally takes place at the local level, and the data are then aggregated to province or state and then national totals.

==Convention on Rights of the Child==
Countries which are signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are therefore expected to set up systems to register the births of all children. Non-registration of a child can have negative consequences on the wider enjoyment of a child&#x27;s fundamental rights to benefits such as identity, inheritance, education, health and other social services. Birth registration is also part of a broader strategy to ensure that children are less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, especially if separated from their parents. In the absence of a functioning birth registration system, it is difficult to see how a country can enforce age-related legal concerns such as schooling, child labour, juvenile justice, early marriage, sexual exploitation and military recruitment. Recent natural disasters and calamities have also demonstrated the utility of a birth certificate for reuniting lost children with their families.

==Records of death and cause of death==
Many civil registration systems also collect information on causes of death. Statistics based on these death records are of particular importance in public health for identifying the magnitude and distribution of major disease problems, and are essential for the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of health programmes and policies.

Toronto scientist, professor Prabhat Jha argues that inexpensive recording of vital statistics in developing countries is the most effective means to improve global health and has outlined 5 options for expanding Cause of Death reporting.

&quot;Despite the importance of tracking causes of death and the tradition since 1893 of standardisation of definitions and coding for causes of death in the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD), global assessments of causes of death are a major analytical challenge. Vital registration systems that include medical certification of the cause of death captured about 18.8 million deaths of an estimated annual total of 51.7 million deaths in 2005, which is the latest year for which the largest number of countries reported deaths from a vital registration system. Even for these deaths, the comparability of findings on the leading causes of death is affected by variation in certification skills among physicians, the diagnostic and pathological data available at the time of completing a death certificate, variations in medical culture in choosing the underlying cause, and legal and institutional frameworks for governing mortality reporting. For the remaining deaths that are not medically certified, many different data sources and diagnostic approaches must be used from surveillance systems, demographic research sites, surveys, censuses, disease registries, and police records to construct a consolidated picture of causes of death in various populations. Because of the variety of data sources and their associated biases, causes of death assessments are inherently uncertain and subject to vigorous debate.&quot;

==National agencies==
===United States===

The recording of vital statistics in the United States is the responsibility of the states, not the federal government. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control:
In the United States, legal authority for the registration of these events [i.e., births, deaths, marriages, and divorces] resides individually with the 50 States, 2 cities (Washington, DC, and New York City), and 5 territories (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). These jurisdictions are responsible for maintaining registries of vital events and for issuing copies of birth, marriage, divorce, and death certificates.

Individuals seeking documentation of a particular birth, death, or marriage must contact the appropriate state, city, or territory office that holds those records.

The CDC&#x27;s National Center for Health Statistics gathers statistics from the states, whose registration procedures may be centralized or decentralized. The CDC analyzes the data gathered to publish monthly and annual reports on such topics as infant mortality, family size, maternal and infant healthcare, fertility rates, death rates, and so on.

In addition, the Social Security Death Index provides nationwide birth and death records of deceased individuals. The Census Bureau publishes voluminous reports based on census data, including the American Community Survey, the U.S. Economic Census, and the Current Population Survey. However, the Census Bureau is forbidden by law from releasing personal information about individuals until 72 years after the information was gathered.

===United Kingdom===
The agency responsible for overseeing this system in the United Kingdom is the Office for National Statistics. Vital statistics for the UK can be found here.

===Canada===
The agency responsible for overseeing the vital statistics system in Canada is the Vital Statistics Program of the Centre for Population Health Data, a division of Statistics Canada. Vital statistics for Canada can be found here.

===India===
In India the vital statistics system is called Civil Registration System (CRS). This system is overseen by the vital statistics division of the Office of Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. Vital statistics for India can be found at CRSORGI

<text>.jp is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Japan. It was established in 1986 and is administered by the Japan Registry Services.

==History==
At the establishment of the .jp domain, the domain was administered by the JPNIC, as part of their role as an overseeing technical body for the Internet in Japan. It was originally proposed by Jun Murai for the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California on August 5, 1986. Handling of the domain was first managed within the &quot;junet-admin&quot; admin group, which was responsible for the operations of JUNET, an early computer network in which Murai was a part of.

In April 1989, the junet-admin group began formally registering .jp domain names. However, due to the growing importance and size of the .jp registry, it was decided at the 11th General Meeting of JPNIC in December 2000 to create a new corporation that would manage the .jp domain. Thus, the Japan Registry Service was created, and on June 30, 2003, officially assumed the duties of the .jp registry.

.jp registrations are only allowed if the registrant has a physical address in Japan. Registrations are processed via accredited registrars and domain names with Japanese characters (kanji, hiragana or katakana) may be registered at the second level.

==Second-level domains==
While any party with a Japanese mailing address can get a second-level domain (&quot;example.jp&quot;) there are several restricted-use second-level domains, listed below.

* ac.jp: higher level academic institutions, such as universities
* ad.jp: JPNIC members
* co.jp: most forms of incorporated companies, including foreign companies registered in Japan
* ed.jp: educational institutions for individuals under 18
* go.jp: Japanese government ministries and their endeavours
* gr.jp: groups of two or more people, or groups of registered companies
* lg.jp: local government authorities
* ne.jp: network service providers
* or.jp: registered organizations and non-profit organizations

=== Geographical type jp domain names ===
*&quot;(organization)&quot;.&quot;(cityname)&quot;.&quot;(prefecturename)&quot;.jp

Domains listed below are reserved for the local governments in Japan:
* metro.tokyo.jp: reserved for the government of Tokyo Metropolis
* pref.&quot;(prefecturename)&quot;.jp: reserved for the prefectural government
* city.&quot;(cityname)&quot;.jp: reserved for cities designated by government ordinance
* city.&quot;(cityname)&quot;.&quot;(prefecturename)&quot;.jp: reserved for non-designated cities and, wards and cities within Tokyo
* town.&quot;(townname)&quot;.&quot;(prefecturename)&quot;.jp: reserved for towns
* vill.&quot;(villagename)&quot;.&quot;(prefecturename)&quot;.jp: reserved for villages

==Internationalized top-level domains==
Japan has considered registering an internationalized country code top-level domain, .. 
In 2008, a preliminary application was made.
 no such domain has been registered.

Private companies have registered the following internationalized generic top-level domains using Japanese script:
*

*.okinawa (Okinawa)
*.osaka (Osaka)
*.ryukyu (Ryukyu, a former kingdom, often used as a traditional alias of Okinawa)

<text>Mösting is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the southeastern fringes of the Mare Insularum. It was named after Danish benefactor Johan Sigismund von Mösting. The ruined crater Sömmering lies to the northwest. To the southeast is the large crater-bay of Flammarion. Mösting has a d inner wall and a small central hill at the midpoint of the floor.

To the south-southeast lies the bowl-shaped Mösting A. This small feature formed the fundamental location in the selenographical coordinate system. It was defined as having the following coordinates:
Later the coordinate system became even more precisely defined using the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mösting.

<text>.ws is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Samoa. It is administered by SamoaNIC, for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Samoa.

The .ws domain is an abbreviation for &quot;Western Samoa&quot;, which was the nation&#x27;s official name in the 1970s when two-letter country codes were standardized. Although there are no geographic restrictions on registration of most second-level .ws domains, .org.ws, .gov.ws, and .edu.ws registration is restricted.

Prior to March 14, 2008, .ws domains were not allowed to be transferred from one domain registrar to another.

The .ws country code has been marketed as a domain hack, with the ws purportedly standing for &quot;world site&quot;, website or web service, providing a &quot;global&quot; Internet presence to registrants, as it supports all internationalized domain names. A popular use for the domain is for news organizations for URL shortening purposes, mainly suffixed as &quot;(organization name)ne.ws&quot;.

Due to its potential popularity, a sliding scale of prices is operated by the registrar, depending on the brevity of the desired domain. Domains with four characters or more are competitively priced while three-, two-, and single-character domains have their own pricing tiers, quickly scaling into thousands of United States dollars. A company named &quot;Global Domains International&quot; operates a multi-level marketing scheme for .ws domain reselling.

In 2016, .ws gained popularity as one of the first domain name registries to offer emoji domains.

, there are approximately 25,000 emoji domains registered on .ws.

Google treats the .ws ccTLD as a generic top level domain gTLD.

<text>.tm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Turkmenistan. It is operated by Internet Computer Bureau.

Nic.tm offers domain name purchase, registration, management and renewal as well as Internationalized Domain Name registration for entities who wish to register their domain names using local Turkmen language characters.

It has been marketed as a domain for businesses with trademarks, due to the common use of &quot;TM&quot; in this context.

== Registrars ==
Domains can be bought directly from the registry or from accredited registrars. The registry currently has registrars from 25 different countries.

Domains can be transferred between accredited registrars via an Auth-Code.

== Second-level domains ==
Since 2020, domain registration services in Turkmenistan are provided exclusively by the Türkmen Domen Economic Society. Türkmen Domen ES was founded in 2014 under the original name &quot;Coordination Center of the National Domain of Turkmenistan&quot; under the auspices of the Turkmenaragatnashyk Agency. The founders of the enterprise were Turkmentelecom, Altyn Asyr and Ashgabat City Telephone Network.

The total number of domain names registered in Turkmenistan as of November 2023 is 1034. The full list is published on the Türkmen Domen ES website.

=== Generic second-level domains ===
* gov.tm — Turkmen government
* edu.tm — education
* mil.tm — Turkmen military

<text>.mn is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Mongolia. It is administered by .MN Registry, Datacom. The domain name is composed of the consonants in the first syllable of the country name. The .MN registry is operated under the thick registry model. Administrative, Billing, Technical and Registrant contacts are required. The Redemption Grace Period (RGP) is available for .MN domains.

The following second-level domains registration for free to qualifying entities:
* .gov.mn – government institutions
* .edu.mn – educational institutions
* .org.mn – non-profit organizations

.MN Registry signed the .mn zone with DNSSEC on 18 November 2010.

==Use outside Mongolia==

The .mn domain name has been used to represent the U.S. state of Minnesota, such as by the Minnesota Legislature (senate.mn and house.mn), but such use is not official in the state.

The .mn domain elsewhere outside Mongolia is used primarily as a domain hack, for example vita.mn (a play on vitamin). Another example is cart.mn (a play on the &quot;South Park&quot; character Eric Cartman, which redirects to www.southparkstudios.com).
