==Early motor routes==
The Good Roads Movement established in May 1860 agitated for better roads for bicyclists. At the turn of the 20th century, interest in the bicycle began to wane in the face of increasing interest in automobiles. In 1913 the Lincoln Highway Association was formed to plan and promote and sign a highway suitable for automobiles using existing roads from Times Square in New York City to San Francisco, California. This was a success and was followed by the development of named auto trails throughout North America. Most of these were subsequently converted to numbered highways.

<text>The Exatron Stringy Floppy (or ESF) is a continuous-loop tape drive developed by Exatron.

== History ==

The company introduced an S-100 stringy floppy drive at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire, and a version for the Radio Shack TRS-80 in 1979. Exatron sold about 4,000 TRS-80 drives by August 1981 for $249.50 each, stating that it was &quot;our best seller by far&quot;. The tape cartridge is about the size of a business card, but about thick. The magnetic tape inside the cartridge is wide.

== Format ==

There is no single catalog of files; to load a specific file the drive searches the entire tape, briefly stopping to read the header of each found file. The tape loop only moves in one direction, so a file that starts behind the current location cannot be read until the drive searches the entire loop for it. The device is capable of reading and writing random access data files (unlike a datacassette). If a record being sought has been overshot, the drive advances the tape until it loops around to the beginning and continues seeking from there.

According to &quot;Embedded Systems&quot; magazine, the Exatron Stringy Floppy uses Manchester encoding, achieving 14K read-write speeds and the code controlling the device was developed by Li-Chen Wang, who also wrote a Tiny BASIC, the basis for the TRS-80 Model I Level I BASIC.

== Reception ==
In the July 1983 issue of &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, the Exatron Stringy Floppy for the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64 was reviewed. Calling the peripheral &quot;a viable alternative&quot; to tape or disk, the magazine noted that &quot;under ideal conditions, a Stringy Floppy can outperform a VIC-1540/1541 disk drive&quot;. Texas Instruments licensed the Stringy Floppy as the Waferdrive for its cancelled TI 99/2 computer and a Compact Computer 40 peripheral which never shipped.

== Use and distribution ==

The Exatron drive was initially used in the Prophet-10 music synthesizer and was later replaced with a micro-cassette drive from Braemar, reportedly due to unreliability and poor mutual compatibility of the former.

Cartridges, or &quot;wafers&quot;, were available in tape lengths ranging from . Known data capacities/tape length are: 4 kB/5 feet, 16 kB/20 feet, 48 kB/50 feet, and 64 kB/75 feet. One complete cycle through a tape takes 55 to 65 seconds, depending on the number of files it contains.

<text>SuperBASIC is an advanced variant of the BASIC programming language with many structured programming additions. It was developed at Sinclair Research by Jan Jones during the early 1980s. 

Originally SuperBASIC was intended as the BASIC interpreter for a home computer code-named &quot;SuperSpectrum&quot;, then under development. This project was later cancelled; however, SuperBASIC was subsequently included in the ROM firmware of the Sinclair QL microcomputer (announced in January 1984), also serving as the command line interpreter for the QL&#x27;s QDOS operating system.

It was one of the first second-generation BASICs to be integrated into a microcomputer&#x27;s operating system (unlike BBC BASIC which preceded it in 1981), making the OS user-extendable—as done by Linus Torvalds in his formative years.

== Advanced features ==

* RESPR for resident procedures, e.g. to extend QDOS
* choice of parameters passed to procedures
* procedures return parameters as chosen
* codice_1 - codice_2 - codice_3 - codice_4
* codice_5 - codice_6 - codice_7 - codice_8
* codice_9 - codice_6 - codice_7 - codice_12
* codice_13 - codice_14 - codice_15 - codice_16
* arbitrarily codice_17 from within procedures &amp; functions
* data type coercion between numeric and string variables
* actual parameters passing data type to formal parameters
* array operations: slicing, joining etc.
* codice_18 arrays &amp; (string) variables
* codice_19 line numbering
* relative codice_20 &amp; codice_21

The function below illustrates the last eight of these features. After having codice_22 it, entering

 PRINT weekdays$(Iso(&quot;19631122&quot;,1))

will print &lt;samp&gt;FRI&lt;/samp&gt; to the screen. Until cleared (e.g. by entering codice_23), the function will act like an extension to the operating system. Similarly, according to the QL User Guide, &quot;many of the operating system commands are themselves defined as procedures.&quot;

== Example ==

 AUTO 11,2
 DEFine FN Iso(S,O)
 LOCal y%,m%,d%,i$,n%,w%
 REM Step 0 - to isolate components of date-stamp S=&quot;YEARMoDa&quot;

<doc id="980059" wikidata="Q1368353" url="?curid=980059" title="Jion kata group">
<text>Ji&#x27;in, Jion, and Jitte form a group of kata used in Shotokan and other karate styles, beginning with the same characteristic kamae of the left hand covering the right, which apparently has roots in ancient Chinese boxing. Their origin is thought to be from the Tomari-te school, however Hirokazu Kanazawa speculates that the Jion kata were devised in the Jionji 慈恩寺, the Jion temple, where martial arts were famously practiced. From there, Kanazawa believes the Jion kata were spread into the Tomari region.

==Ji&#x27;in==
Ji&#x27;in 慈陰 (&quot;Temple Ground&quot;) is important for the execution of many simultaneous techniques and the often-repeated stances, enabling swift changes of direction while maintaining balance, power and steps of equal length. It has, however, been removed from the Japan Karate Association teaching and grading syllabus.

==Jion==
Jion 慈恩 (&quot;Temple Sound&quot; ) is a representative kata in the Shotokan system because of the importance of the perfection of the basic stances it contains, notably zenkutsu dachi (front stance) and kiba dachi (horse stance).
Also practiced in some Shitō-ryū organizations, emphasis is also placed on Kokutsu dachi, or back stance.

==Jitte==
The name Jitte 十手 (&quot;Ten Hands&quot;) expresses that mastery of this kata which enables one to fight like ten men. Jitte teaches techniques usable against armed attacks, especially the bo.
It consists of 24 movements and should be performed in about 60 seconds.

Also known in some styles as Sip Soo.

Both &quot;Jitte&quot; and &quot;Jutte&quot; are correct pronunciations and romanized spellings of the kanji 十手.

<doc id="980073" wikidata="Q4639143" url="?curid=980073" title="4 mm scale">
<text>4 mm scale is the most popular model railway scale used in the United Kingdom. The term refers to the use of 4 millimeters on the model equating to a distance of 1 foot (305 mm) on the prototype (1:76.2). It is also used for military modelling.

For historical reasons, a number of different standards are employed.

==Standard gauge==
Three different gauges are used for modelling standard gauge railways in the United Kingdom.

===OO gauge===
OO gauge uses 4 mm scale with 16.5 mm gauge track, which is inaccurately narrow since it is correct for HO scale (1:87.1). It is the most popular standard in the UK for 4 mm scale trains and is produced by the two main manufacturers in the UK. The traditional standard for wheels and track is a very coarse one with extremely oversize rails and flanges; in recent years, some manufacturers have switched to using the American National Model Railroad Association HO standard S-4 instead.

===EM gauge===
EM was originally defined to use 18mm as the track gauge (hence the name: Eighteen Millimetres). This was revised, and today EM gauge uses an track gauge, which is closer to accurate but not fully to scale. It was developed as an early improvement on the standard OO system. It is still popular with FineScale modellers today because it utilises larger than scale flanges on the wheels of rolling stock, and because point and crossing (P&amp;C) work is a little easier due to an overscale flangeway clearance. These two concessions in scaling down the prototype make for reliable running. This factor explains the continued popularity of EM as a scale for finescale modellers working today.

===P4===
P4, otherwise known as Protofour, or &quot;18.83&quot;, is a close to exact 4 mm:1 ft replica of real-life track and wheel dimensions. The gauge of track built to these standards is 18.83 mm. Along with EM Gauge It is also a popular choice for finescale modellers working today. The main advantage of P4 over the other 4 mm standards is that the wheel flanges are approximately to scale and the flangeway gaps on P&amp;C work are also close to scale. This is most noticeable in photographs of the model where in many cases is it almost impossible to detect that you are looking at a model, as opposed to the real thing. The disadvantages of near to scale flanges and flangeway crossings are that the trackwork has to be laid and built to very close tolerances and needs to be flat. If this is not the case then the reliability of rolling stock on the trackwork is compromised leading to poor running and derailments. This problem can, to an extent, be mitigated by the use of some form of suspension system in the locomotives and rolling stock used on the layout. There are different ways to do this and reference to one of the societies supporting modelling to this standard is recommended.

==Conversion to EM and P4==
00 models can be converted to work on EM or P4 by replacing or reprofiling wheels, fitting the correct width axles and moving the locomotive or carriage frames outward to suit. Modern products from Hornby, Bachmann UK and others have some element of springing in their suspension to aid this, and many aftermarket chassis kits exist from a variety of vendors such as high level kits, Comet, DJH, and others. Products intended for the more dedicated modeller are generally designed to be buildable to fit any of the three standards, though one side effect of underscale locomotive frames for 00 gauge is that the width between the frames is limited, which can limit the size of electric motor that may be fitted.

==Irish Broad Gauge==
Irish Broad Gauge is 5&#x27; 3&quot;. OO models are available from Bachmann and have previously been available from Lima. P4 standards can also be used with a track gauge of 21 mm.

==Narrow gauge==

===OO9===

9 mm gauge (N gauge) track used to model 2&#x27;–2&#x27;6&quot; gauge prototypes.

===OOn3===

12 mm gauge (TT gauge) track used to model prototypes which were common in Ireland and the Isle of Man.

<doc id="980074" wikidata="Q1173673" url="?curid=980074" title="Hangetsu">
<text>Hangetsu (半月) (Japanese: &quot;Half Moon&quot;) is an advanced kata practiced in Shotokan karate. It originates from the Naha-te school. The first part is executed slowly with strong breathing, stressing the development of the hara, or energy field. This sequence shares a strong similarity with Seisan. The second part of the kata is more dynamic in its execution, with an explosion of punches as well as graceful mae geri (front kicks). Due to the shared principles of expansion and contraction, Gichin Funakoshi substituted Hangetsu for Sanchin in the Shotokan curriculum. Mastery of this kata rests on mastery of hangetsu-dachi (half-moon stance) which is characterized by its semi-circular step movement of the back leg to the center, and then forward. The kata consists of 41 movements. The older Okinawan version of this kata is known as Seisan.

<text>Grecìa Salentina (Griko for &quot;Salentine Greece&quot;) is an area in the peninsula of Salento in southern Italy, near the town of Lecce which is inhabited by the Griko people, an ethnic Greek minority in southern Italy who speak Griko, a variant of Greek.

==Overview==
The Union of the Towns of Grecìa Salentina (&quot;Unione dei Comuni della Grecìa Salentina&quot;) consists of eleven towns and forms part of the province of Lecce in the administrative area of Apulia (&quot;Puglia&quot;), and was founded by the Griko population in 1966. The purpose of this union was to promote the knowledge of Griko and preserve its culture, by organizing research at the university, teaching the language at schools and publishing books and poetry in the endangered dialect.

The following towns are members of the Union: Calimera, Martano, Castrignano dei Greci, Corigliano d&#x27;Otranto, Melpignano, Soleto, Sternatia, Zollino, Martignano, Carpignano Salentino and Cutrofiano. The towns of Carpignano Salentino and Cutrofiano joined the Union in 2007, though the inhabitants of these two towns have not spoken their original Greek dialect called &quot;griko&quot; for two centuries.

<doc id="980081" wikidata="Q690747" url="?curid=980081" title="Gojūshiho">
<text> is a &quot;kata&quot; practiced in karate. Gojushiho was developed by Sokon Matsumura, one of the key founders of Okinawan martial arts and named it &quot;Uesheishi&quot;, which literally means 54 methods in Chinese. In some styles of karate, there are two versions of this &quot;kata&quot; - &quot;Gojūshiho Shō&quot; and &quot;Gojūshiho Dai&quot;. An advantage of the two versions of the &quot;kata&quot; is to better master the difficult techniques presented therein, but not without facing some confusion, for many sequences are the same and others only slightly different. The &quot;embusen&quot; of both &quot;Gojūshiho Shō&quot; and &quot;Gojūshiho Dai&quot; are nearly identical. &quot;Gojūshiho Shō&quot; begins straight off with a wide variety of advanced techniques and, as such, is highly recommended for study. &quot;Gojūshiho Dai&quot; consists of many advanced open-handed techniques and attacks to the collar-bone.

Gojushiho movement is quite similar with Aikido grappling technique in terms of flowing knife hand or &quot;tate-shuto-uke&quot; or vertical knife hand block. &quot;Tate-shuto-uke&quot; does not resemble other shuto uke which resemble as &quot;block technique&quot;. Rather it was throwing technique in &quot;aiki-jujutsu&quot;. Another &quot;shuto&quot; technique as &quot;shuto-nagashi-uke&quot; or &quot;knife-hand-flowing-block&quot; has become the unique characteristic of Gojushiho because of flowing movement which is not merely interpreted as &quot;block&quot;, but &quot;throw&quot;.

&quot;Gojūshiho Shō&quot; and &quot;Gojūshiho Dai&quot; are two versions in Shotokan of the Shōrin-ryū &quot;kata&quot; called Useishi (54) or Gojūshiho. The oft-repeated story about the JKA having to rename the Gojushiho kata due to a tournament mix-up; and Kanazawa Hirokazu, because of his seniority, keeping the original names in his SKIF organisation is without foundation. In fact, Kanazawa is on record as saying that when he formed SKIF he changed the names of the two kata as he felt the “sho” designation suited the smaller, more difficult, kata better. Kanazawa also mentioned this kata was introduced into the JKA before its sibling, and this explained why the JKA decided to call it “dai” when they introduced the second Gojushiho into the syllabus.
This kata is also practiced in Tang Soo Do and is called &quot;O Sip Sa Bo&quot; in Korean. It is said it also has some influences of Ng Ying Kungfu (Chinese: 五形功夫). Due to its difficulty, this kata is often reserved for advanced students, usually for those who are 6th degree black belts and above.

Gojushiho is also practiced in Goshin Kagen Goju Karate, a modified style of Goju founded by Hanshi Gerald Thomson

<text>The Calouste Gulbenkian Museum houses one of the world&#x27;s most important private art collections. It includes works from Ancient Egypt to the early 20th century, spanning the arts of the Islamic World, China and Japan, as well as the French decorative arts, the jewellery of René Lalique and some of the most important painters of all times works such as Rembrandt, Monet, Rubens, Manet, Renoir, Degas and Turner. 

==Collection==
The permanent exhibition and galleries are distributed chronologically and in geographical order to create two independent circuits within the overall tour.

The first circuit highlights Greco-Roman art from classical antiquity, as well as art from the ancient Near East and the Nile Valley. Among the artworks are ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Persian, and Armenian pieces, as well as Persian art from the Islamic period.

The second circuit includes European art, with sections dedicated to the art of the book, sculpture, painting and the decorative arts, particularly 18th century French art and the work of René Lalique. In this circuit, a wide-ranging number of pieces reflect various European artistic trends from the beginning of the 11th century to the mid-20th century. The section begins with works in ivory and illuminated manuscript books, followed by a selection of 15th, 16th and 17th century sculptures and paintings. Renaissance art produced in the Netherlands, Flanders, France and Italy is on display in the next room.

French 18th century decorative art has a special place in the museum, with outstanding gold and silver objects and furniture, as well as paintings and sculptures. This section is followed by galleries exhibiting a large group of paintings by the Venetian Francesco Guardi, 18th and 19th century English paintings, and finally a superb collection of jewels and glass by René Lalique, displayed in its own room.

Some of the works in the collection were bought during the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings. Of about 6000 items in the museum&#x27;s collections, a selection of around 1000 is on permanent exhibition. Gulbenkian&#x27;s motto was &quot;only the best&quot;; hence the museum has masterpieces by western European artists such as Domenico Ghirlandaio, Rubens, Rembrandt, Rodin, Carpeaux, Houdon, Renoir, Dierick Bouts, Vittore Carpaccio, Cima da Conegliano, Van Dyck, Corot, Degas, Nattier, George Romney, Stefan Lochner, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour, Édouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, Claude Monet, Jean-François Millet, Sir Edward Burne-Jones, Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Mallord William Turner, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Giovanni Battista Moroni, Frans Hals, Ruisdael, Boucher, Largillière, Andrea della Robbia, Pisanello, Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, Antonio Rossellino, André-Charles Boulle
, Charles Cressent, Oeben, Riesener, Antoine-Sébastien Durand, Charles Spire, Jean Deforges, François-Thomas Germain.

==History==

Vasco Maria Eugénio de Almeida acquired part of the Parque de Santa Gertrudes, in April 1957, for the construction of the Foundation buildings and public/private park. Two years later, a competition was launched for a project to construct the organization&#x27;s headquarters. It was eventually won by the team that included architects Alberto J. Pessoa, Pedro Cid and Ruy Jervis d&#x27;Athouguia (1917-2006), in addition to the landscaping architects António Viana Barreto and Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles, who were responsible for designing the park surrounding the building. Later, Francisco Caetano Keil do Amaral was added to the team, as a consultant, and Frederico Henrique George joined the team working on the building.

In December 1961, the anterior project of the park was begun, while work on the earthworks and retaining walls beginning the following year. A sculpture panel was installed in the headquarters building by architect Artur Rosa in 1962. By 1967, the interior finishing were adjudicated, with the project concluded in 1968. On 2 October 1969, the buildings and gardens were inaugurated.
The 12th International Federation of Landscaping Architects Congress was held in September 1970 on the grounds of the Gulbenkian Foundation. In 1975, the property was distinguished with the Valmor Prize.

==Architecture==
The museum was designed as a showcase for the collection, which was relatively unique for an art museum at a time when most museums were housed in buildings originally built for other purposes. The landscaping and museum building interact, with views into woods and wetlands punctuating the artwork on display, while woodland paths offer views of the dramatic building, the edges of which include terraces and water features that blur the border between built and natural environment. The grouped buildings are set within a park bordered by the &quot;Avenida de Berna&quot; (north), &quot;Avenida António Augusto de Aguiar&quot; (west), &quot;Rua Marquês de Sá da Bandeira&quot; (east) and the &quot;Centro de Arte Moderna&quot; (south).

The shape of the museum and headquarters is relatively simple, with T-shaped wings, each with an entrance. The massive volume, long and horizontal was used for administration, services and as auditoriums, off of the main, single entry space. It is in this entrance that the panel &quot;Começar&quot;, by Almada Negreiros is situated.

&quot;Vleeshal&quot; means meat-hall, as it was the only place in Haarlem where fresh meat was allowed to be sold from 1604 to the 18th century; salted meat was instead sold in the Warmoesstraat, the street next to the building. This function is illustrated by the ox-heads on the front of the building.

It was designed in renaissance style by Lieven de Key. It was built from 1602 to 1603. Before that there was already a small Vleeshal on the crossing of the Spekstraat and the Warmoesstraat, but around 1600 it had become too small, and the meat had to be sold outside. The new building was a prestigious project; expensive materials and a beautiful design were used. It opened on November 1, 1604. There was room for 40 different meat merchants in the building.

The building was in use as meat-hall until 1840. Afterwards it was used by the National Archive (&quot;Rijksarchief&quot;) and the Haarlem Public Library.

==Two Museums==
Since 1950 the building has been in use as a gallery by the Frans Hals Museum, which holds art exhibitions there under the name &quot;Frans Hals Museum - Hal&quot;. The entrance to that museum is through the house directly to the right of the building. The cellar of the Vleeshal is used by the Archaeological Museum Haarlem, which has a permanent exhibition on various aspects of the archeology of Haarlem, as well as a modest exhibition area for new finds. The entrance to that museum is through the small door on the left leading down into the cellar.

==Replicas==
The West End Collegiate Church on West End Avenue in Manhattan, New Amsterdam is modeled after the Vleeshal.

<text>The 30 mm caliber is a range of autocannon ammunition. It includes the NATO standardized Swiss 30×173mm (STANAG 4624), the Soviet 30×155mmB, 30×165mm and 30×210mmB, the Czechoslovak 30×210mm, the Yugoslav 30×192mm, the British 30×113mmB, and the French 30×150mmB and 30×170mm cartridges.

==Usage==
Ammunition in 30 mm is typically not used against personnel but rather as an anti-materiel or armor-piercing round. Rounds of this size can be effective against lightly armored vehicles as well as fortified bunkers. It is also a popular caliber for shipboard close-in weapons systems (CIWS), such as the Russian AK-630 and Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation use their 30 mm weapons in a variety of vehicles, including the Su-25 attack aircraft, Mi-24 helicopter, Mi-28 attack helicopter, Ka-50 attack helicopter, and the BMP-2, BMP-3, and BTR-90 infantry fighting vehicles. The most modern anti-aircraft gun systems in use by Russia are chambered in 30 mm. 

The U.S. military uses 30 mm weapons in their A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack aircraft, AC-130 gunship (AC-130J Ghostrider variant), and AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. It was going to be used in the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, until the project was canceled. The United States Navy uses 30 mm weapons on the &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class amphibious transport dock and on and s as part of the surface warfare (SuW) package. In 2012, the Navy decided to replace the Mk 110 57 mm cannons on s with the Mk 46 GWS (Gun Weapon System), a navalized mounting of the Mk44 Bushmaster chain gun.
In 2022, the United States Coast Guard announced plans to install 30 mm Mk44 chain guns on newly-built Polar Security Cutters (PSCs), though existing cutters would retain their 25mm Mark 38 mounts.

==Types of ammunition==
30 mm calibre weapons are used in a variety of roles. As a result, ammunition in 30 mm comes in several varieties: armor-piercing (AP), high-explosive (HE), airburst, and target practice (TP) rounds. Both AP and HE cartridges commonly possess incendiary or tracer elements, which may be noted in its designation; API and HE-T are Armor-Piercing Incendiary and High-Explosive Tracer respectively.

<doc id="980091" wikidata="Q898799" url="?curid=980091" title="Trasianka">
<text>Trasianka or trasyanka (, ) is an informal term for mixed form of speech in which Belarusian and Russian elements and structures are combined arbitrarily. Due to the negative connotation of the word &quot;trasianka&quot; it has been suggested that in the linguistic debate the term &quot;Belarusian-Russian mixed speech&quot; should be used.

== Etymology ==
In Belarusian, the word means a kind of low quality fodder: hay is mixed with cut straw (unlike hay, straw has no nutritional value) by thoroughly shaking the mixture (shake: , ) when the owner is low on hay supply. The word acquired the second meaning (&quot;language mixture of low quality&quot;) relatively recently, in the second half of the 1980s, when a series of publications in the literary newspaper () criticized developments in the use of the Belarusian language under Soviet rule. Zianon Pazniak is often said to be the one who has popularized the use of the word for the Belarusian-Russian language mixture. For the Belarusian-Russian borderland it has been reported that the phenomenon usually referred to by the term is called (mixed-up [language]) instead (this information is based on an interdisciplinary research carried out in the district of Horki and Drybin in 2004).

== History ==
===Mixed speech in pre-Soviet and early Soviet era===
In the area of present-day Belarus the mixing of speech has a relatively long history. This is because the Belarusian (and, similarly, Ukrainian) territories were for a long time borderlands in which local dialects contacted with closely related socially dominant languages (Polish, Russian). Whether such older forms of mixing Belarusian with Russian should be referred to as “trasianka” is arguable as there was no intergenerational transfer of speech in those times. A literary example for this kind of mixing can be found in the 19th-century play by Wincenty Dunin-Marcinkiewicz &quot;The Gentry of Pinsk&quot; (see the 1984 edition). Although it is a piece of art and not a record of everyday speech, it can be assumed that it reflects real language use (in certain situations with certain types of people) of that time. A first academic and journalistic debate on Belarusian-Russian mixed speech took place in the 1920s.

===After World War II===
The phenomenon referred to as “trasianka” since the 1980s had its origins in the fundamental socio-demographic changes which took place in Soviet Belarus after World War II, and in the eastern parts of Belarus partially already before World War II. The industrialization of Soviet Belarus led to a massive labor migration from villages to towns. While in 1959 31% of the population lived in towns, in 1990 the urban share had already reached 66%. At the same time ethnic Russians from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated to Soviet Belarus and, in many cases, took on leadership tasks in the Belarusian communist party, administration and state companies. Consequently, the language use of former Belarusian villagers - and new town dwellers - had to adapt from (mostly dialectal) Belarusian to standard Russian, a target which speakers seldom reached, however. As a result of this struggle for linguistic accommodation, the so-called &quot;trasianka&quot; in its contemporary form emerged, and, moreover, children of its speakers grew up using mixed Belarusian-Russian variety.

== Linguistic status ==
Due to the negative connotation of the word “trasianka” it has been suggested to abandon it in the linguistic debate and use the term “Belarusian-Russian mixed speech” instead.
Scientific discussion on Belarusian-Russian mixed speech began in the first half of the 1990s. Influential Belarusian scholars have pointed out the spontaneous, individual, “piecemeal” or even “chaotic” fashion of Belarusian-Russian speech mixing. These ‘early’ debates were based mainly on informal observations though, due to a lack of text bodies in the mixed speech. A first empirical case study on the phenomenon has been undertaken only in the early 2000s in the capital Minsk.
In the years 2008-2013 a research project carried out by linguists and social scientists at the University of Oldenburg (in cooperation with partners from the Belarusian State University in Minsk) has created two bodies of oral texts in the mixed speech . The linguistic results of the mentioned research project attested the older view that Belarusian-Russian mixed speech could yet not be classified as one relatively stable, homogenous fused lect all over Belarus. On the other hand, on all levels of the linguistic structure several country-wide relatively stable patterns could be observed which the mixed speech shares with one or both of its “donor” languages (Belarusian and Russian) or which, respectively, make the mixed speech differ from both donor languages. Russian elements and traits clearly dominate in the lexicon as well as in morphosyntax. The inflectional morphology is obviously a hybrid, and even the pronunciation is influenced by Russian. All in all, the Belarusian-Russian mixed speech in its current stage is classified as a complex of regional social dialects.

== Sociology of mixed speech use ==
The sociological and sociolinguistic component of the above-mentioned research project on mixed language use in Belarus showed, inter alia, the following results: Asked about their ‘native language’, roughly 38% of around 1200 respondents named the Belarusian-Russian mixed speech, 49% Belarusian and 30% Russian (more than one answer was allowed). As their ‘first language’ roughly 50% declared the mixed speech, 42% Russian and 18% Belarusian (again more than one answer was allowed). Finally, as their ‘primarily used language’ roughly 55% named Russian, 41% the mixed speech and 4% Belarusian.
The results of the research project contradict the popular opinion that the use of Belarusian-Russian mixed speech is an indicator for a poor education level and a lack of proficiency in Russian or Belarusian standard language. The mixed speech is widespread among Belarusians from all educational levels and age groups and used alongside the standard language, which in most cases is Russian. The degree to which individuals tend to approximate ‘their’ mixed speech use to Russian or, respectively, to Belarusian depends on such factors as interlocutors, conversation place, topic etc. Among young Belarusians the relative weight of mixed speech use decreases in favour of Russian.

== Phonology ==

The Phonology of Belarusian-Russian mixed speech is closer to Belarusian. From the point of view of the Russian speaker, the following distinctions are noticeable:
* presence of palatal affricate consonants , instead of , , i.e. – &quot;дзень&quot; &quot;day&quot; – instead of &quot;день&quot;, – &quot;цихий&quot; &quot;quiet&quot; – instead of &quot;тихий&quot;
* absence of palatalization of the consonant in front of , i.e. – &quot;пъют&quot; &quot;(they) drink&quot; – instead of &quot;пьют&quot;
* assimilative palatalization of the consonants, i.e. – &quot;дзвери&quot; &quot;doors&quot; – instead of &quot;двери&quot;
* aspirate , i.e. (&quot;сьвята&quot; &quot;holiday&quot;), (&quot;шесьть&quot; &quot;six&quot;)
* “hard” hushing sibilants, [ʈ͡ʂ] as in Belarusian instead of [t͡ɕ] as in Russian, i.e. – &quot;чашка&quot; &quot;cup&quot; – instead of 
* “hard” instead of , i.e. – &quot;трапка&quot; &quot;rag&quot; – instead of &quot;тряпка&quot;
* presence of non-syllabic bilabial in place of etymological (в) and (л) instead of Russian normative at the end of the word, i.e. – &quot;праўда&quot; &quot;truth&quot; – instead of правда, – &quot;воўк&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; – instead of &quot;волк&quot;, – &quot;писаў&quot; &quot;(he) wrote&quot; – instead of &quot;писал&quot;

== Vocabulary ==

Belarusian-Russian mixed speech mostly includes Russian words which have a Belarusian analogue shaped by Belarusian phonology and morphology. Some examples of high-frequency Russian words are (Belarusian and English translations are given in parentheses):
* Nouns: ( &quot;child&quot;), ( &quot;flower&quot;), ( &quot;money&quot;)
* Verbs: ( &quot;to work&quot;), ( &quot;to do&quot;), ( &quot;to wait&quot;)
* Adjectives: ( &quot;past&quot;), ( &quot;next&quot;), ( &quot;beautiful&quot;), ( &quot;bad&quot;)
Many words have Russian stem, but other morphemes come from Belarusian.

Part of vocabulary comes exclusively from Belarusian (Russian and English translations are given in parentheses when necessary):
* Family titles: ( &quot;mother&quot;), ( &quot;father&quot;), ( &quot;daughter&quot;); some words sound the same in both languages: (&quot;son&quot;), (&quot;brother&quot;), (&quot;grandma&quot;); or differ by regular phonetic substitutions: (&quot;sister&quot;), (&quot;son-in-law&quot;), (&quot;daughter-in-law&quot;), (&quot;grandpa&quot;), (&quot;grandson&quot;), (&quot;bride&quot;), (&quot;bridegroom&quot;).
* Name of some fruits and vegetables: (, &quot;potato&quot;), (, &quot;beet&quot;), (, &quot;thyme&quot;)
* The word (, &quot;home”)

Professional and urban words are borrowed almost exclusively from Russian.

== Morphology ==

Inflection mostly conforms with the norms of the Belarusian language. Russian and Belarusian have different norms of declension, especially case declension. For instance, in the instrumental case in Russian masculine nouns ending in -а have inflection -ей, -ой, while in Belarusian the ending becomes -ам – the norm that is present in Belarusian-Russian mixed speech: гаварыла з Мишам, з Вовам (&quot;spoke with Misha, with Vova&quot;).

Verbs in the 3rd person singular miss final -т, including verbs coming from Russian: атвячае (&quot;(she) answers&quot;), знае (&quot;(she) knows&quot;), таргуе (&quot;(she) sells&quot;). Sometimes, it is replaced with -ць: атвячаець, знаець, таргуець. In the infinitive form of Russian verbs final -ть is replaced with -ць: весіць (&quot;to weight&quot;), знаць (&quot;to know&quot;).

Postfix -ся is more frequently used, even when Russian norm requires -сь: началася (&quot;(she has) started&quot;), баялася (&quot;(she) was afraid&quot;), прышлося (&quot;had to&quot;), спуталася (&quot;become tangled&quot;), учыліся (&quot;(they) studied&quot;).

<doc id="980096" wikidata="Q7196828" url="?curid=980096" title="Pioneer Valley Transit Authority">
<text>The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) oversees and coordinates public transportation in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts, offering fixed-route bus service, paratransit service, and senior van service. PVTA was created by Chapter 161B of the Massachusetts General Laws in 1974. Based in Springfield, Massachusetts, PVTA serves Hampden and Hampshire counties, and provides connecting service to CT&quot;transit&quot; in Hartford County, Connecticut, to FRTA in Franklin County, and to WRTA in Worcester County. It is the largest regional transit authority, and second largest public transit system in Massachusetts after the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, providing service to over 11 million riders annually across 24 municipalities in the region, with about 70% of all riders using the system as their primary mode of transit.

==Organizational structure==

As per Section 25, Chapter 161B of the Massachusetts General Laws, regional transit authorities in Massachusetts are not permitted to directly operate their service, but must instead contract with other entities to operate the buses. As such, the PVTA contracts with two entities to provide fixed-route service in the service area: First Transit and UMass Transit Services. The contractors run semi-autonomous garages that act as vehicle depots for the surrounding areas.

===Springfield Area Transit Company===
The Springfield Area Transit Company (SATCo) operates the southern portion of PVTA&#x27;s service area, servicing Hampden County. SATCo, located at 665 Cottage Street in Springfield, is managed by First Transit. All SATCo fixed-route buses are numbered in the 1000 series. SATCo transports more than 9 million passengers annually.

===UMass Transit Services===
UMass Transit Services operates PVTA&#x27;s routes through the Five Colleges area in eastern Hampshire County and neighboring towns, with most of the routes centered around UMass Amherst, the largest ridership generator in the service area. UMass Transit Services is a department within the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The UMass Transit garage is located on-campus at 255 Governors Drive, Amherst. All UMass Transit fixed-route buses are numbered in the 3000 series. UMass Transit is a student-based organization with more than 90% of the employees (i.e. bus drivers, mechanics, dispatchers) being UMass students, with the remaining employees falling under University 03 employment status or full time administrators. UMass Transit Services is one of the oldest student driver groups in the country, having been founded in 1969 as a demonstration grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration. UMass Transit Services operates 10 routes with a fleet of 40 transit vehicles (35&#x27; - 60&#x27;). Service runs 12 months a year, 20 hours per day, seven days per week. UMass Transit Services transports more than 3.5 million passengers annually.

==Fares==

===One-way===
One-way fixed-route fares are noted below.

&quot;NOTE: Buses operated by UMass Transit Services (3000-series) do not have fareboxes (see UMass Transit buses below).&quot;

One-way fares for adults 13 and older are $1.40 if purchased at the PVTA Customer Service Center at Springfield Union Station. Transfers for children 6-12 are $0.25, and transfers for mobility impaired passengers and seniors are $0.10.

===Passes===
All passes are good through the end of the service day.
*1-Day passes are sold on PVTA Springfield and Northampton buses at the fareboxes, as well as at ticket vending machines at Springfield Union Station, Holyoke Transportation Center, and Westfield Olver Transit Pavilion. 
*7- and 31-day passes are sold at Big Y supermarkets in the service area, at Springfield Union Station (at the PVTA Customer Service Center as well as the ticket vending machines), at the Holyoke Transportation Center (at the customer service center as well as the ticket vending machine), at the Westfield Olver Transit Pavilion (ticket vending machines only), and by the Western New England University&#x27;s bursar office.

=== Mobile ticketing ===
PVTA offers riders the ability to purchase tickets and passes on their smartphone, removing the need to pay cash on board or purchase physical passes ahead of time, using the MassDOT BusPlus app. Tickets and passes purchased on smartphones are validated electronically with mobile ticket validators, located inside the front door of the bus on the right side. Tickets are visually validated by bus operators when mobile ticket validators are unavailable. This program launched on July 19, 2020, and mobile ticket validators entered service on January 2, 2024.

===Routes operated by UMass Transit Services===
PVTA buses operated by UMass Transit do not charge fares. See here for more details.

==Ridership increase==

Ridership is up 12% in September 2014 and 9% in October.

==Accounting errors investigation==
An audit in 2005 revealed that the PVTA made approximately $10 million in accounting errors on a transportation development project at Springfield&#x27;s Union Station. Initial reports said PVTA could owe the federal government as much as $4 million. That amount was reduced in 2009 to less than $1 million. A federal probe in 2006 also targeted some PVTA employees. Subsequently, Administrator Gary Shepard resigned in 2006 after being put on leave by the Advisory Board, but he was never charged with any offense.

<text>Andrea Mitchell (born October 30, 1946) is an American television journalist, anchor and commentator for NBC News, based in Washington, D.C.

She is NBC News&#x27; chief foreign affairs &amp; chief Washington correspondent, reporting on the 2008 presidential election campaign for NBC News broadcasts, including &quot;NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt,&quot; &quot;Today&quot; and MSNBC. She anchored &quot;Andrea Mitchell Reports,&quot; which aired from noon to 1 p.m. ET weekdays on MSNBC. On October 29, 2024, in closing remarks on her show, Mitchell announced she will be leaving the full time anchor chair in early 2025. Mitchell will remain in her role as chief foreign affairs correspondent.

Mitchell has both appeared on and guest hosted &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; She was also often a guest on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; and &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show.&quot;

In 2019, Mitchell earned a Lifetime Achievement Emmy for her journalistic work.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Mitchell was raised in a Jewish family, from New Rochelle, New York, the daughter of Sydney Mitchell, a businessman, and his wife, Cecile Mitchell. Her family&#x27;s original surname was Metchik. The family is of Russian-Jewish descent.

Her father was the chief executive officer and partial owner of a furniture manufacturing company in Manhattan. He was also the president of Beth El Synagogue in New Rochelle for 40 years. Her mother was an administrator at the New York Institute of Technology in Manhattan. Her brother Arthur and his wife, Nancy Mitchell, moved to British Columbia in the 1970s. He has dual American and Canadian citizenship, becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly of Yukon and the leader of the Yukon Liberal Party in the 2000s.

Mitchell is a graduate of New Rochelle High School. She went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1967. While at Penn, she served as news director of student radio station WXPN. Staying in Philadelphia after graduation, she was hired as a reporter at KYW radio. She rose to prominence as the station&#x27;s City Hall correspondent during the Mayor Frank Rizzo’s administration and also reported for sister station KYW-TV.

She moved in 1976 to CBS-affiliate WTOP (now WUSA) in Washington, D.C. Two years later, Mitchell moved to NBC&#x27;s network news operation, where she served as a general correspondent. In 1979, she was named NBC News&#x27; energy correspondent and reported on the late-1970s energy crisis and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. Mitchell also covered the White House from 1981 until becoming chief congressional correspondent in 1988.

==NBC News and MSNBC==

Mitchell has been with NBC News since late July 1978. She has been its chief foreign affairs correspondent since November 1994. Previously, she served as chief White House correspondent (1993–1994) and chief Congressional correspondent (1988–1992).

In 2005, Mitchell&#x27;s book, &quot;Talking Back... to Presidents, Dictators, and Assorted Scoundrels,&quot; (), was published. It chronicles her work as a journalist.

From 2008 to 2025, Mitchell hosted &quot;Andrea Mitchell Reports&quot; on MSNBC. She stepped down from that position on February 7, 2025, but will remain NBC News&#x27; chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent. 

==Controversies==
===Plame affair===
A report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (&quot;Bush Administration Is Focus of Inquiry CIA Agent&#x27;s Identity Was Leaked to Media&quot; by Mike Allen and Dana Priest, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, September 28, 2003) that Mitchell had leaked Valerie Plame&#x27;s identity led to her being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In October 2003, on the &quot;Capitol,&quot; Mitchell said&quot;,&quot; &quot;It was widely known amongst those of us who cover the intelligence community and who were actively engaged in trying to track down who among the foreign service community was the envoy to Niger. But, frankly, I wasn&#x27;t aware of [Plame&#x27;s] actual role at the CIA, and the fact that she had a covert role involving weapons of mass destruction, not until Bob Novak wrote it.&quot;

===Sudanese incident===
During a July 2005 news conference in Khartoum, Mitchell was forcibly ejected from a room after asking Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir some pointed questions. They included: &quot;Can you tell us why the violence is continuing?&quot; (referring to genocide in Sudan&#x27;s Darfur province) and &quot;Can you tell us why the government is supporting the militias?&quot; &quot;Why should Americans believe your promises?&quot; 

After the incident Mitchell said, &quot;It is our job to ask. They can always say &#x27;no comment&#x27;... but to drag a reporter out just for asking is inexcusable behavior.&quot;

Before the incident, Sudanese officials had expressed reservations about allowing American newspaper or television reporters to join the Sudanese press pool. Sean McCormack, the State Department&#x27;s assistant secretary for public affairs, said to his Sudanese counterpart, &quot;I&#x27;ll convey your desires about not permitting reporters to ask questions, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll do. We have a free press.&quot; McCormack&#x27;s Sudanese counterpart replied, &quot;There is no freedom of the press here.&quot;

===Offensive remarks ===
During an appearance on MSNBC on June 5, 2008, Mitchell referred to the voters of the southwest Virginia region as rednecks. On June 9, she apologized on air, saying &quot;I owe an apology to the good people of Bristol, Virginia, for something stupid that I said last week. I was trying to explain, based on reporting from Democratic strategists, why Barack Obama was campaigning in southwest Virginia, but without attribution or explanation, I used a term strategists often use to demean an entire community. No excuses, I&#x27;m really sorry.&quot;

Having been led to believe that a clip showed that presidential candidate Mitt Romney was impressed by a touchscreen at a Wawa convenience store, Mitchell and contributor Chris Cillizza laughed when it was shown on &quot;Andrea Mitchell Reports&quot;, alluding to a widely held myth that George H. W. Bush was unfamiliar with a supermarket scanner in an incident during his 1992 campaign. She suggested this might be Romney&#x27;s &quot;supermarket scanner moment.&quot; She said, &quot;I get the feeling that Mitt Romney has not been in too many Wawas along the roadside of Pennsylvania.&quot; The full clip puts his comments in the context of his claim that Wawa&#x27;s &quot;touchtone keypads&quot; (touchscreens) show efficiency in the private sector compared to his statement that it took multiple filings of a 33-page government form for an optometrist to change his address.

Mitchell briefly addressed complaints from the Republican National Committee and Romney&#x27;s campaign the following day. Introducing the full clip, Mitchell stated, &quot;The RNC and the campaign both reached out to us, saying that Romney had more to say on that visit about federal bureaucracy and innovation in the private sector. We didn&#x27;t get a chance to play that, so here it is now.&quot;

In February 2019, Mitchell characterized the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising as being against &quot;the Polish and Nazi regimes.&quot; She apologized on Twitter for her comment. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance sued Mitchell in Polish court for alleging that Poland played a role in the Holocaust.

==Personal life==

She married her second husband, then Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, on April 6, 1997, following a lengthy relationship. Previously, she was married to Gil Jackson; that marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970s.

On September 7, 2011, Mitchell revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer during a doctor&#x27;s visit a few weeks earlier. It was caught early and treated.

<doc id="980101" wikidata="Q1503636" url="?curid=980101" title="Unsū">
<text>, is the most advanced kata found in the Shotokan, Shito-Ryu and Wado-Ryu karate styles and is generally taught to karateka at the 3rd to 4th Dan. It contains many intricate hand techniques, such as the ippon-nukite (one finger strike) in the opening sequence. Unsu also contains a 360-degree spinning double-kick with a double-leg take down at the same time, landing on the floor face-down before continuing. Because of this, it is a very common kata in tournaments and seen as method of testing the competitors knowledge, spirit and skill. 

Per Bruce Clayton in his book, &quot;Shotokan&#x27;s Secret&quot;, Unsu was created by Seisho Arakaki sometime around 1860-1870. Arakaki was a Japanese and Chinese language interpreter to the Shuri court, and a master of monk fist and white crane styles. It is somewhat a condensation of other katas (e.g., Bassai, Kanku, Jion, Empi, Jitte and Gankaku), hence it is essential to have mastered these before practicing Unsu.

The movement, Unsu, or hands in the cloud, is used to sweep away the hands of the opponent and is said to signify the gathering clouds in a thunderstorm. 

Masatoshi Nakayama suggests in &quot;the Best Karate&quot; volume containing Unsu, that the name derives from the constant transformations, expansions, contractions, shifting, etc. of the body as the Kata is performed, just as clouds constantly change and transform. It consists of 48 moves.

<doc id="980103" wikidata="Q4950060" url="?curid=980103" title="Bounty jumper">
<text>Bounty jumpers were men who enlisted in the Union or Confederate army during the American Civil War only to collect a bounty and then leave. The Enrollment Act of 1863 instituted conscription but allowed individuals to pay a bounty to someone else to fight in their place. Bounty jumpers commonly enlisted numerous times in the army, collecting many bounties in the process.

==Methods==
Being a bounty jumper was more profitable in the North. A month after the Battle of Fort Sumter the United States Congress passed a law allowing for bounties up to $300. The Confederate government did likewise, starting at $50 and then later in the war increased the bounty to $100. As the US dollar was also worth more than the Confederate dollar ever was, the Northern government had greater luck with bounties, and was more likely to have to deal with bounty jumpers. With state and local governments also adding to bounties, the total could amount to $1000, a considerable amount. As the typical Northern private was paid $13 a month, the bonuses were considerable.

Typically, the bounty jumper would desert his unit before arriving on the front lines, traveling to a new area to gain another bounty. One bounty jumper collected at least 32 bounties. Another bounty jumper, John Larney aka &quot;Mollie Matches&quot;, claimed to have enlisted and deserted from 93 regiments for bounties.

==Consequences==
Due to the number of bounty jumpers taking advantage of being substitutes for those drafted, the Confederate Congress withdrew the law making substitutions possible in December 1863.

Not all bounty jumpers successfully left their new unit. During the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in 1864, one bounty jumper who was a member of the 35th Massachusetts Regiment shouted &quot;Retreat!&quot; causing the entire unit to panic and run back to their earthworks.

A popular place for bounty jumpers to go to was New York City. At one time 3,000 professional bounty jumpers were believed to be in the city. A dozen a day were found in a brief campaign to catch jumpers in February 1863; many were caught while enjoying themselves at a brothel. Toward the end of the war, detective Lafayette Baker captured 183 bounty jumpers in a single day by having an infamous broker named Theodore Allen help him use a fake recruitment office; ironically, Allen eventually ran off to Canada with $50,000 that was intended for capturing the bounty jumpers.
One bounty jumper became particularly famous. Adam Worth became an international thief, with Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s painting &quot;Duchess&quot; being his most famous acquisition. He would become known as the &quot;Napoleon of Crime&quot;, a label Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would borrow when creating the character Professor Moriarty, whom Doyle loosely based on Worth. According to William Pinkerton, Worth did actually fight once, for the Union in the Battle of the Wilderness, and once collected a $30 Confederate bounty, only to eventually fight for the Union. Pinkerton further said that Worth did what he did due to greed and lack of patriotism, not cowardice.

Northerners typically saw bounty jumpers as either &quot;urban, largely foreign underclass&quot; worthy of contempt, or viewed as urban dandies. The view of them as cowardly was generally universal. This wide view allowed Northern authorities to punish bounty jumpers more harshly than other deserters.

==Punishment==

Bounty jumping could be a capital offense. The most notable execution of bounty jumpers in the Union Army took place at Beverly Ford, Virginia on August 29, 1863. Five bounty jumpers had been recaptured after deserting from the 118th Pennsylvania &quot;Corn Exchange&quot; Regiment and sentenced to death. Appeals were sent all the way to President Lincoln, who decided that the desertion of bounty jumpers was becoming too severe a problem and denied the appeal. The execution of the five deserters took place with the entire V Corps (to which the 118th Pennsylvania belonged) assembled to witness the shooting. In 1864 three bounty jumpers were executed on the parade grounds of Camp Morton in Indianapolis. At Governor&#x27;s Island in early 1865, bounty jumper James Develin was executed; he had been turned in by his wife after she caught him with another woman. Bounty jumpers were more likely to receive death sentences than those deserters who left due to homesickness, or to help the family farm, or simply as a lark against authority. In another incident, a bounty jumper attempting to escape his captors was shot when one of them overtook him, placing the pistol directly to the back of the man&#x27;s head while both were running.

Not all punishments were capital. When a man who bounty jumped 32 times was caught, he was sentenced to four years in prison. The infamous Andersonville prison held hundreds of bounty jumpers.

Bounty jumpers also faced torture. One method to torture bounty jumpers was by use of thumbscrews.

<text>Felton &quot;Corky&quot; McCorquodale (August 23, 1904 – November 23, 1968) was a professional poker player, noted as the person who introduced Texas hold &#x27;em to Las Vegas in 1963.

Poker had been legal in Las Vegas since 1931, but Texas hold &#x27;em was not played. In 1963, McCorquodale introduced Texas hold&#x27;em at the California Club in Las Vegas. The game became popular and quickly spread to the Golden Nugget, Stardust and Dunes.

He was a respected no-limit player in his career. Since McCorquodale&#x27;s death in 1968, Texas hold ‘em has now become one of the most popular forms of the game in the world.

He was a posthumous charter inductee into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1979.

<text>Sōchin (壯鎭) (Japanese: &quot;Tranquil Force&quot;, or &quot;Preserve the Peace&quot;) is a kata practiced in several styles of karate. It may have derived from Dragon style kung fu, and was taught in the Naha-te school in Okinawa by Seisho Arakaki. It was then passed down to Shitō-ryū. Later, a variation of it was introduced into the Shotokan style by Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s son, Yoshitaka. Some branches of Tang Soo Do have added it to their curriculum under the name &quot;Sojin&quot;.

The rhythm of the kata is dynamic, characterized by slow, deliberate movements interspersed with explosive bursts of speed. In the Shotokan version of the kata, the dominant stance is &quot;sōchin-dachi&quot; aka &quot;fudo-dachi&quot; (rooted stance). In the Shitō-ryū version, it employs several stances including &quot;nekoashi-dachi&quot; (cat stance) and &quot;zenkutsu dachi&quot; (front stance). Rhythm is important in its execution. This kata has been said to develop chi/ki energy.

Sōchin is practiced in Shuri Style Karate, not from Naha Style.

<text>Nijūshiho or Niseishi, Nandan sho (二十四歩) (Japanese: Twenty-Four Steps) is an advanced &quot;kata&quot; practiced in Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, Chito-ryu, Ryūei-ryū, Shuri-ryū and Wadō-ryū karate.

The origin of &quot;Nijūshiho&quot; is unknown, but it is presumed that it originates from the Aragaki group like Sochin and others. This is shown through the similarity to Unsu. In introducing karate from Okinawa to Japan, Gichin Funakoshi changed the name of the &quot;kata&quot; from &quot;Niseishi&quot; to &quot;Nijūshiho&quot;. Both names mean &quot;Twenty-Four Steps.&quot;

This kata is also practiced in Tang Soo Do and is called &quot;E Sip Sa Bo&quot; in Korean. Due to its difficulty, this kata is often reserved for advanced black belt level students. Like its Japanese and Okinawan counterparts, &quot;E Sip Sa Bo&quot; also translates to “Twenty-Four Steps.”

In Shuri-ryu this kata is taught to students achieving the rank of shodan.

<text>The Ford Fusion Hybrid is a gasoline-electric hybrid powered version of the mid-sized Ford Fusion sedan manufactured and marketed by Ford, which had two generations. A plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi, was released in the U.S. in February 2013. The last model year for all Ford Fusions was 2020.

The first generation was launched to the U.S. market in March 2009 for model year 2010, together with its badge-engineered variants, the Mercury Milan Hybrid and the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid. The second generation was launched under the Ford and Lincoln brands for model year 2013, went on sale in the U.S. in October 2012.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid at combined city/highway. The second generation hybrid improved the fuel economy rating to for combined city/highway driving. The EPA rated the Energi&#x27;s combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.7 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 106 mpg-imp). In hybrid operation (charge-sustaining mode), the Energi has a combined fuel economy of .

The Fusion Hybrid won the 2010 North American Car of the Year Award, and the entire 2013 Ford Fusion line-up, including the Fusion hybrid and plug-in variants, won the 2013 Green Car of the Year. , over 285,000 units of the Fusion hybrid family were sold in the United States since 2009, including the plug-in hybrid variant. , sales of the Fusion Energi totaled 43,327 units delivered in its main market, the U.S.

==First generation==
===History and development===

The hybrid electric version of the Fusion was announced at the 2005 North American International Auto Show, along with the public introduction of the original 2006 Fusion. At that time Ford announced that the hybrid version was scheduled to be introduced in early 2009 for the 2010 model year, with a suggested retail price of US$27,270. The new Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Sport officially debuted at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2008.

The Fusion Hybrid was manufactured at Ford&#x27;s Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly plant, located in Sonora, Mexico. Ford set a modest sales target of about 25,000 vehicles a year for the Fusion Hybrid and the similar Mercury Milan.

The Fusion Hybrid was made available for press testing in December 2008 and launched to the U.S. market in March 2009, along with the Mercury Milan Hybrid.

The Fusion was the first new hybrid vehicle the Ford brand offered in five years, and, after the Ford Escape Hybrid, the second Ford hybrid vehicle.

The 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, launched in the U.S. market in September 2010, shares the hybrid powertrain from the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids, and delivers an estimated fuel economy of . The MKZ Hybrid offers several improvements of Ford&#x27;s Smart Gauge with EcoGuide, first introduced in the 2010 Fusion Hybrid.

===Design and technology===

The Fusion Hybrid is a &quot;full&quot; hybrid because both propulsion sources, an electric motor powered by a Sanyo supplied 275 V nickel-metal hydride battery, and a 2.5L Atkinson cycle I4 156 hp 136 ft.lb. gasoline engine with intake variable cam timing(iVCT), have substantial power ratings and either can be used alone to propel the vehicle. When braking or decelerating, the Fusion&#x27;s hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle&#x27;s momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. Ford claims that nearly 94 percent energy recovery is achieved by first delivering full regenerative braking followed by friction brakes during city driving. Under ideal conditions, Ford claims the Fusion Hybrid can cruise at up to on battery power alone.

Once perceived as a laggard in hybrid technology, Ford now claims nearly 500 hybrid patents that allow the Fusion Hybrid to achieve 41 MPG on the highway. According to Hybridcars.com, Ford has pointed to its talented inventors, making &quot;special mention of Ming Kuang who has helped Ford since 2000 to expand its portfolio of hybrid patents from just 10 patents when he began to 461 today.&quot; Quoted in Autotrader.com, the veteran engineer says &quot;it&#x27;s about helping make the world my children live in-and the world my children&#x27;s children will live in-a better place.&quot;

===Safety===
The Ford Fusion line-up was included in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2010 &quot;Top Safety Pick&#x27;s&quot; rating for the mid-size category. As of June 2010, Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids were the only two mid-size hybrid vehicles in the list. Due to the fact that Ford recently modified and strengthened the roof structure of the Flex, Fusion, and MKT vehicles, these 2010 ratings apply only to Lincoln MKZs, Mercury Milan, and Fusions built after April 2010.

===Fuel economy and environmental performance===

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the fuel economy for the 2010 Fusion Hybrid at city, highway. The following table compares fuel economy, carbon footprint, and petroleum consumption between the hybrid version and other drivetrains of the Fusion family as estimated by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy:

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; found that their Fusion Hybrid delivered only in of mixed driving, 5 mpg off the EPA combined rating. Over another of testing against a Toyota Camry Hybrid, the same car only achieved , while the Camry Hybrid delivered . &quot;If our early numbers hold up, the Fusion Hybrid would be a rare instance of the EPA relapsing into the world of mileage make-believe.&quot; However, they noted that when driven very conservatively, the EPA numbers could be achieved. &quot;In typical driving, you might as well throw the Fusion&#x27;s EPA numbers out the window. But if you decide to really work at it, they&#x27;re possible.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; also tested a Fusion Hybrid and achieved no more than over of driving, which was greater than the Camry Hybrid () or Nissan Altima Hybrid () though not by the margin indicated by the EPA ratings.

According to Ford, the vehicle was built to have a fuel efficiency of 41 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway by EPA standards. In December 2008, Autoblog Green staff reported they had obtained in-city mileage of 43.1 mpg on the streets of Los Angeles. In addition, a Los Angeles Times reporter informed in December 2008 that he had obtained 52 mpg in mixed city-highway driving with little difficulty.

On a single-tank publicity stunt conducted in April 2009, a Fusion Hybrid managed on a 1,445.7 mile trip.

Edmunds&#x27; InsideLine received a 2010 Fusion Hybrid as a long-term test car. Over of driving, their vehicle had only averaged , with a best tank of and a worst tank of .

Reduced Electric Vehicle Operation of 2010 - 2012 Fusion Hybrid

Many owners complained to Ford about greatly reduced gas mileage after nine years of operation because of reduced electric vehicle operation and increased gasoline engine operation. Ford notified their dealers that they were investigating a fix:

TSB #SSM 48238 &quot;Oct 3 2019 8922 - 2010-2012 Fusion HEV, 2010-2011 Milan HEV, 2011-2012 MKZ HEV - Reduced Electric Vehicle Operation

Some 2010-2012 Fusion hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), 2010-2011 Milan HEV, and 2011-2012 MKZ HEV vehicles may experience reduced electric vehicle operation and increased gasoline engine operation. Do not attempt repairs at this time. Engineering is investigating, monitor OASIS for updates.&quot;

Customer satisfaction program number 22G04 was issued by Ford in September 2022. Ford performed the BECM/PCM update free of charge through Sept 28, 2023. Owners were eligible for a refund if they paid to have this performed at a dealer previously. Title: Application Performance Upgrade 22G04 Certain 2010 – 2012 Model Year Fusion / MKZ / Milan Hybrid Vehicles Hybrid Battery Reduced Electric Vehicle Operation BECM and PCM Software Update

===Payback time===
According to Edmunds.com, the price premium paid for the Fusion Hybrid takes five years to recover in fuel savings as compared to its non-hybrid sibling, and is one of the quickest payback periods among top selling hybrids as of February 2012. Edmunds compared the hybrid version priced at with a comparably-equipped gasoline-powered Fusion priced at and found that the payback period is six years for gasoline at per gallon, for years at per gallon, and drops to three years with gasoline prices at per gallon. These estimates assume an average of annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com&#x27;s true market value estimates. For the same two vehicles, the U.S. EPA estimated the Fusion Hybrid annual fuel cost at while the gasoline-powered Fusion has an annual fuel cost of . EPA estimates are based on 45% highway and 55% city driving, over 15,000 annual miles, and gasoline price of per gallon, the national average as of February 2012. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid has no price premium.

===SmartGauge for eco driving===

The Fusion Hybrid comes with a SmartGauge with the EcoGuide which features two 4.3-inch high-resolution, full-color LCD screens on either side of the vehicle&#x27;s analog speedometer. The objective of these panel displays is to coach drivers on how to optimize the performance of their hybrid by keeping track of their eco driving improvements.

These screens can be configured to show different levels of driver information, including fuel and battery power levels, and average and instant fuel economy. When set in tutorial mode, the instrument panel in the right side &quot;grows&quot; leaves and vines on-screen to reward fuel-efficient driving. The more leaves and vines that appear, the more efficient the driving behavior is and the more fuel is being saved. Long-term fuel efficiency can also be displayed as a traditional chart. The left side display shows when the car is in pure-electric mode, and shows the state of battery charge.

The 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, launched in September 2010, offered an improvement of Ford&#x27;s SmartGauge with EcoGuide introduced with the 2010 Fusion and Milan hybrids.

In 2012, with the introduction of the second generation Fusion, Ford redesigned its SmartGauge with EcoGuide system giving it a newer look and new customizable MyView features. One of the new features, Brake Coach, gives instant feedback on the driver&#x27;s braking habits and gives advice to maximize the efficiency of the regenerative braking system. 

===Tax credit===
The Fusion Hybrid qualified for a maximum hybrid tax credit of US$3,400 if purchased by March 31, 2009. The credit dropped to US$1,700 if purchased by September 30, 2009, to US$850 if purchased from October 2009 and March 31, 2010, and phased out on April 1, 2010.

===Other markets===
The Brazilian version of the Fusion Hybrid was unveiled at the 2010 São Paulo International Auto Show. Sales began in November 2010 at a price of (). The Fusion Hybrid was the first full hybrid car sold in Brazil. Imported from Mexico, the Fusion Hybrid engine performance and fuel system durability was tested with the Brazilian mandatory E20 to E25 ethanol blends.

==Second generation==
A complete redesign of the Ford Fusion lineup for the model year 2013 was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. The new lineup included three optional engines for the conventional four-cylinder-only gasoline model, a next-generation hybrid version, and a plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi. The Ford Fusion was the first production sedan to offer these three powertrain options. In April 2012 Ford announced that an auto start-stop system would be available for the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine non-hybrid version, at a price of . The expected fuel economy was a combined . Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid version began in the U.S. in October 2012.

Sales in Europe and Asia, under the Ford Mondeo name, were planned to start in 2013. Ford began taking orders of the Mondeo Hybrid in Germany in August 2014. Production of the Mondeo Hybrid began at Ford&#x27;s Valencia, Spain, plant in November 2014.

The nickel-metal hydride batteries used in the hybrid first generation were replaced with lithium-ion batteries. The 2013 model year Fusion Hybrid is more fuel efficient than its predecessor, with a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rating of combined, in city and in highway driving.

The second generation hybrid has a powertrain with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-four – downsized from the 2.5-liter unit used in the first generation Fusion Hybrid. Total output is estimated at and , running to the front wheels via an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission. The lithium-ion battery pack saves weight and generates more power than the previous NiMH batteries, and raised its maximum speed under electric-only power from .

The 2013 Fusion Hybrid includes driver assistance and technologies based on sensors, cameras and radar that enable the car to see and respond. Fusion can help drivers maintain proper lane position (Lane Keeping System); adjust vehicle speed to changing traffic conditions through adaptive cruise control; active park assist to help identify suitable parking spaces and help park; and Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, which consists of sensors in both rear quarter-panels that are able to detect traffic in a driver&#x27;s blind spot, providing both audible and visual warnings if traffic unseen by the driver is detected. BLIS technology enables cross-traffic alert, even aiding drivers backing out of parking space where visibility is obstructed.

===Lincoln MKZ Hybrid===

During the 2012 North American International Auto Show, Ford also unveiled the Lincoln MKZ concept model. Ford offered a hybrid option of the redesigned 2013 Lincoln MKZ, and like the previous MKZ generation, the MKZ Hybrid is available for the same price as the non-hybrid model.

The EPA rated initially the 2013 MKZ Hybrid at with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. After the ratings of six Ford models were downgraded in June 2014, the MKZ was the model with the largest fuel economy reduction, 7 mpg-US in city/highway combined. The revised EPA ratings of 2013/14 MKZ Hybrid are combined, in city and in highway driving. Despite sharing the same powertrain, the 2013/14 MKZ Hybrid is rated 4 mpg-US combined less than its sibling the second generation Ford Fusion Hybrid, and 6 mpg-US less in city driving.

===Ford Mondeo Hybrid===
The Mondeo Hybrid shares the same powertrain of the Fusion Hybrid combining a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with an electric motor and 1.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. Under the New European Driving Cycle the Mondeo is rated at in combined driving, and for urban driving, with emissions of 99 g/km. Ford set a pricing for the Mondeo Hybrid that is competitive with Mondeo diesel powertrain variants. Retail deliveries are scheduled to begin in the UK in December 2014 at a pricing starting at .

===Controversy over fuel economy ratings===

In December 2012, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; reported that &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; and &quot;Green Car Reports&quot; have found that the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple EPA ratings in real-world use. After running both vehicles through &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; real-world tests, the magazine found that 2013 Fusion hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of , with for city and highway. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; concluded that the overall fuel economy for the Fusion Hybrid is off by 8 mpg, representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA&#x27;s combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within 2 mpg margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the Toyota Prius c and the Prius liftback/fastback, respectively.

A few days later the Environmental Protection Agency said it will review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles were not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA&#x27;s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan commented that hybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional vehicle. Most vehicles&#x27; real-world gasoline mileage is less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than the sticker number depending on speed, temperature, and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop. Ford responded in a statement, saying that, &quot;Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary.&quot; A Ford spokesman also said they followed EPA&#x27;s test guidelines and the company is standing by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols.

In July 2013, Ford issued a voluntary software update for the 2013 model year Fusion, C-Max, and MKZ Hybrid to improve on the lower-than-expected MPG claims.
Some of the changes included:
* Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from , allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway
* Optimizing the use of Active Grille Shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions including cold weather, during air conditioner use, and when the engine coolant temperature is higher
* Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan&#x27;s energy consumption
* Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50 percent to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts
* Optimizing the climate control system to minimize use of the air conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold weather operation.

In August 2013, due to the criticism and after several lawsuits about the worse-than-expected fuel economy, Ford voluntarily lowered all three EPA ratings of the C-Max Hybrid and paid a rebate to 32,000 C-Max owners. The revised fuel economy ratings for combined was lowered from to .

In June 2014, Ford announced it had discovered an error in the company&#x27;s internal testing data, and downgraded the fuel economy ratings on six of its 2013 and 2014 model year vehicles, including all its C-Max, Fusion, and MKZ full hybrids and its two plug-in Energi models. Ford made goodwill payments to around 200,000 customers affected by its mistake. After the ratings were lowered, the 2013/14 Fusion Hybrid still slightly outperformed the 2012/2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE by 1 mpg-US city and 2 mpg-US highway, and the Camry XLE by 4 mpg-US city and 3 mpg-US highway.

==Ford Fusion Energi==
The Fusion Energi is a plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show, and retail sales in the U.S. began in February 2013. Initially it was priced at , and in January 2014 the starting price was reduced to . Due to the capacity of its battery pack, the Energi qualified for a federal tax credit up to and any applicable state and local incentives. Energi models purchased in or after 2010 were eligible for a $4,007 tax credit, based on the capacity of the battery. The 2013 Fusion Energi is eligible for access to California&#x27;s high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) with a solo driver, and had a California state tax rebate.

A refreshed 2017 Fusion Energi was released by mid-2016. In addition to a new fascia and other technological upgrades, the 2017 model year has more efficient electric motors, allowing the refreshed 2017 model year Fusion Energi to increase its all-electric range and to improve its EPA fuel economy ratings. , over 43,700 units had been sold in North America, with 43,327 units delivered in the U.S. and about 386 units in Canada.

Unlike the regular hybrid there is no Lincoln MKZ version of the Energi.

===Specifications and range===
The Fusion Energi uses the same non-turbo 2-liter 4-cylinder engine supplements as the 2013 Fusion Hybrid to assist the electric motor. The Energi has a 7.6 kWh lithium-ion battery that powers the electric motor. The plug-in hybrid delivers total horsepower of 195 (145 kW) with a fully charged battery and has an electric-only top speed of , more than the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid.
The Fusion Energi, model years 2013 through 2016, has an official EPA all-electric range of and a total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery of . The all-electric range of the 2017 and newer model year Fusion Energi is with total range of .

The EPA&#x27;s 2015 edition of the &quot;Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends&quot; presents utility factors for plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, in electric only or blended modes. Both the Fusion and C-Max Energi models have a utility factor in EV mode of 45%, compared with 83% for the BMW i3 REx, 66/65% for the Chevrolet Volt/Cadillac ELR, 43% for the McLaren P1, 37% for the BMW i8, and 29% for the Toyota Prius PHV.

In May 2016, Ford reported, based on data collected from more than 610 million miles (976 million km) logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system, that drivers of these vehicles run an average of annually on their vehicles, with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode. A breakdown of these figures shows an average daily commute of for Ford Energi plug-in hybrid drivers. According to Ford data, currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home.

===Fuel economy===
Initially, the EPA rated the Energi&#x27;s combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 100 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.4 L gasoline equivalent/100 km). Later, due to complaints from owners not achieving the sticker fuel economy, and following a technical review, the official EPA rating in EV mode was downgraded to 88 MPG-e (). The Fusion Energi combined fuel economy equivalent is the same as the 2013 Ford C-Max Energi. In a similar way, in hybrid operation, initially the Energi had an EPA combined city/highway fuel economy of . It was later downgraded by the EPA to . EPA&#x27;s rating for combined EV/hybrid operation is 51 MPG-e (4.6 L gasoline equivalent/100 km), which allowed the Fusion Energi to rank at the time in sixth place, together with the C-Max Energi, among the top ten EPA-Rated Fuel Sippers since 1984.

The refreshed 2017 model year Fusion Energi has an increased EPA rated fuel economy in all-electric mode to 97 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) () for combined city/highway driving, with an energy consumption of 35 kWh/100 mi. The EPA rating in hybrid operation rose to .

A police pursuit version achieves , whereas the regular Interceptor gets .

===2009–2012===
During 2009, the Fusion Hybrid sold in the U.S. market a total of 15,554 units and the Milan Hybrid 1,486 units, as reported by the manufacturers. Although the Fusion Hybrid helped Ford bypass Honda to become the second biggest seller of hybrids in the US market in the month of December 2009, for the whole year of 2009, Honda sold more hybrid vehicles (35,691 units) than Ford (33,520 units) and the 2010 Honda Insight also outsold the Fusion Hybrid, with 20,572 units.

For 2010, U.S. sales of Ford Fusion Hybrid reached of 20,816 units, helping the model to become the third best selling hybrid in 2010 after the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. The Milan Hybrid sold 1,416 units in 2010 and its production was discontinued as part of Ford&#x27;s decision to phase out the entire Mercury brand. Purchases by the US Government at the behest of the Obama administration accounted for almost a third of the Ford Fusion Hybrids produced between 2009 and late 2010.

Ford reported that Fusion sales reached 151,004 units through July 2011, of which, 7,780 were the hybrid version, representing a 5.1% market share of all Fusion sales. During year 2011, the Fusion Hybrid sold 11,286 units and the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid sold 5,739 units, ranking sixth and tenth correspondingly, in hybrid sales for calendar year 2011. Fusion hybrid sales in 2012 increased 24.9% over 2011 sales, and hybrid models represented a 5.8% share of the 241,263 Fusion sold in 2012.

===2013===

The introduction of the redesigned 2013 model year Fusion, with a more fuel efficient second generation powertrain, resulted in increased sales of the hybrid version, and by August 2013, sales were up 275.2% over the same period in 2012. The Fusion Energi achieved record sales in August 2013. Also during this month, the Fusion Hybrid recorded its best sales month ever in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Seattle, and its second best-selling month in Los Angeles, another key hybrid market. This rapid increase in sales contributed to Ford achieving its best August electric drive vehicle sales ever. The Fusion Hybrid sales increased 164.3% from 2012 and ended 2013 as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. after the Prius liftback, the Prius c and the Toyota Camry Hybrid.

The redesigned 2013 model year Lincoln MKZ hybrid also experienced somewhat stronger sales during 2013. In July 2013, Ford announced that for the 2014 model year MKZ hybrid it would increase the share of production allocated to the hybrid version, from 20% for the 2013 model year to 40% of the 2014 model year. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is popular among consumers in part because it has the same base price as the non-hybrid MKZ.

===2014===

Sales of hybrid electric cars in the U.S. in 2014 declined 8.8% from 2013. Following the trend of the hybrid market, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 5.0% from 2013, and continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid continued its growth trend with sales up 34.3% from a year earlier. The American plug-in hybrid market in 2014 was up 13.1% from 2013, while combined sales of both of Ford&#x27;s Energi models (Fusion and C-Max) increased by 50.9% despite the reduction of their fuel economy ratings. Sales of the Fusion Energi were up 89.7% from 2013 while C-Mx Energi sales were up only by 17.9%.

===2015===

The American hybrid electric segment continued to decline in 2015, down 15% from 2014. Following the general U.S. trend, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 30.3% from 2014, and the Fusion continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid fell 16.2% from a year earlier. The American plug-in hybrid market in 2015 was up 5.8% from 2014, however, sales of the Fusion Energi were down 15.6% from 2014, and C-Max Energi sales were down by 10.0%. The Fusion Energi ranked as the second top selling plug-in hybrid in the country after the Chevrolet Volt, up from third place in 2014, and passing the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid.

===2017===

In 2017, after a redesign which improved efficiency, Ford Fusion Hybrid sales surged by 70.8%, making it the number two selling hybrid car in America, after the Toyota Prius Liftback, which had 12.5% more sales. In contrast, the newly released Prius Prime surged 745%, consuming all the growth in the PHEV market, and American PHEVs like the Fusion (-39.6%) and Chevy Volt (-17.7%) suffered steep declines as new PHEV models from Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes ate into American car sales.

===Total US sales===

Since 2009 a total of 356,534 units of the Fusion hybrid family, including the Energi plug-in hybrid, have been sold in the United States through December 2017. U.S. sales by year for each model and the share of hybrids out of total model sales are shown in the following table:

<text>Salento (, Salentino: &quot;Salentu&quot;, Salentino Griko: &quot;Σαλέντο&quot;), is a cultural, historical, and geographic region at the southern end of the administrative region of Apulia, in southern Italy. It is a sub-peninsula of the Italian Peninsula, sometimes described as the &quot;heel&quot; of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;. It encompasses the entire administrative area of the Province of Lecce, most of the Province of Brindisi (all of it except Fasano and Cisternino), and the south-eastern part of the Province of Taranto (like Grottaglie and Avetrana, but not Taranto itself).

== Etymology ==
In ancient times the peninsula was named &quot;Sallentina&quot;, &quot;Calabria&quot;, or &quot;Messapia&quot;.

==History==
=== Early history ===
In the eleventh century BC, Messapians migrated to Apulia from the Illyrian coast, to what was Messapia (Greek: &quot;Μεσσαπία&quot;) which was the ancient name of a region of Italy largely corresponding to modern Salento. Following the migration, the Greeks arrived in Messapia from Sparta, and giving Salento the name &quot;Magna Grecia&quot;.

In the fourth century BC, the Roman Empire built the Appian Way or Via Appia, connecting the capital Rome to Apulia. The Romans expelled the Greeks and took control of the region in 272 BC. Under Roman occupation, Salento developed a flourishing agricultural economy growing wheat, and producing olive oil. The Roman Empire collapsed in 476 AD.

=== Byzantine Era to 1480 ===
Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Salento came under the control of the Ostrogoths. Otranto in the sixth century AD became the seat of the Byzantine government, which during the Byzantine era, the Greek population had returned to Salento, bringing the Greek language, religious beliefs, artistic influences, agriculture, and trade. Greek is still seen in parts of Salento as Salentino Griko. Following the Greek return, the Lombards tried to conquer Apulia and Salento in 569 AD, but were pushed back by the Byzantines in Northern Apulia. The Saracen people occupied Bari, Ugento, and Taranto in 847 AD, but the Byzantines and Greeks still remained in the un-occupied regions of Salento. Following this occupation, the Saracens in 870 AD destroyed Ugento, and deported all the inhabitants of Ugento to Africa, which after the destruction of Ugento, Taranto was also destroyed by the Saracens. In 1016, the Normans arrived in Southern Italy, landing in Salerno.

Apulia became governed in 1059 by the Norman Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and this was the beginning of a period of prosperity for the region of Salento. Apulia became a part of the Holy Roman Empire under Henri VI von Hohenstaufen, followed by his son, the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II. Between 1266-1442, the French Angevins came to power and Apulia became part of the Kingdom of Naples, taken from the Kingdom of Sicily. Following the merger with Naples, the Kingdom of Naples became a part of the Crown of Aragon until 1458.

=== 1480-1815 ===
In 1480, the Ottomans under Gedik Ahmed Pasha lay siege to and ransack Otranto. Hundreds to almost a thousand men were slaughtered over the age of 15 by the Ottomans when they refused to convert to Islam, causing them to be beheaded. Neighboring towns to Otranto were fortified in an attempt to protect themselves from the Ottomans and further onslaughts. During this period, between the years of 1482 and 1484, the Venetians briefly gained control of Salento. In 1534, Emperor Charles V realises the strategic importance of Salento as a base to fight against the Turks. Charles V restores several castles, among them the castle of Lecce.

In 1713, Austria was granted Salento in the Treaty of Utrecht, although the Venetians and Ottoman Turks continued to attack the region. Following Austria being granted access, in 1734, the Battle of Bitonto, Spain defeatee Austria and took control of Apulia once more. In 1806, the abolition of feudal society within the Kingdom of Naples under the French, near the start of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples.

=== Risorgimento to 1900s ===
Following the abolition of feudal society in 1816, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily went through a state merger, becoming the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Late Bronze Age settlements were complex and comparatively rich. They lost their wealth at the beginning of the Iron Age and degraded into dispersed huts.

In 1861, during the Risorgimento, Apulia joined the new Kingdom of Italy, which following Apulia joining the young nation, the Catholic Church was forced to sell the majority of its land by the Kingdom.

=== Modern history ===
In 1922, under Mussolini the production of grain, olives and wine is increased in Apulia to try to make Italy a self-sufficient nation. In 1939, the Second World War had started, which German troops were placed in Salento and Italy. In 1943 in the ongoing the Second World War, Italy joined the allied powers, causing the ports of Bari, Brindisi and Taranto to suffer heavy bombing as Allied troops attempted to remove German forces from Apulia.

==Geography==

The Salento peninsula is composed of limestone, dividing the Gulf of Taranto to the west from the Strait of Otranto on the east, with the Adriatic Sea to the north and the Ionian Sea to the south. Known also as &quot;peninsula salentina&quot;, from a geo-morphologic point of view it encompasses the land borders between Ionian and the Adriatic Seas, to the &quot;Messapic threshold&quot;, a depression that runs along the Taranto-Ostuni line and separates it from the Murge.

The climate is typically Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters which provides suitable conditions for the cultivation of olives, citrus fruits and palm trees. The generally flat topography and surrounding seas can make Salento prone to windy weather year round. 

Winters are mild and rainy with temperatures generally hovering in the teens °C during the day. Occasional bora winds from the northeast can bring colder temperatures to the east of the Italian Peninsula. Snowfall has been recorded as recently as 2017 but is generally very rare in coastal Salento. In contrast, southerly sirocco winds can bring warm temperatures of 20°C+ even during the midwinter months. Alongside much of southern Italy, summers are hot, dry and sunny. While the seas which surround Salento moderate it from the extreme heat seen in Foggia and Basilicata, summer temperatures are still high with temperatures occasionally reaching 40°C or higher during heatwaves. Sirocco winds from the south occasionally deposit dust and sand from the Sahara in the coastal towns of Salento during such heatwaves. Humidity levels can be high and summer thunderstorms are not unknown. 

Its borders are:
* Taranto, in the Province of Taranto
* Pilone, in the territory of Ostuni, in the Province of Brindisi
* Santa Maria di Leuca, in the Province of Lecce.

===Cities and towns in Salento===
== Culture ==

=== Language ===
In Salentino, the Salentino dialect of Extreme Southern Italian is predominantly spoken, although an old Hellenic dialect (known as Griko) is also spoken in a few inland towns.

=== Food and gastronomy ===
Some of the popular dishes from the Salento area include: 
* &quot;Orecchiette&quot;, &#x27;ear-shaped&#x27; pasta, often cooked with tomato sauce and a strong creamy cheese called &quot;ricotta schianta&quot;, or with &quot;rapini&quot;
* &quot;Parmigiana di melanzane&quot;, made with aubergines, tomato sauce and cheese like mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
* &quot;Pitta di patate&quot;, a savoury pie made with mashed potatoes.
*&quot;Turcinieddhri&quot;, also known as gnummareddi, grilled lamb offal. 
* &quot;Purciaddruzzi&quot;, fried hand-made small cookies with honey, eaten at Christmastime.

==Transportation==
The nearest international airports are those of Brindisi and Bari (the latter is out of Salento but not far).

A 2-lane freeway connects Salento to Bari. The main railway line ends at Lecce. Other locations are served by regional railroads.

Leisure ports are those of: Taranto, Brindisi, Campomarino di Maruggio&#x27;s tourist and leisure Marina, Gallipoli, Santa Maria di Leuca, Otranto.

==Tourism==
In the province of Lecce, the Ciolo cave is one of the main tourist destinations.

===Festivals===
Salento&#x27;s &quot;sagre&quot; food festivals show off local cuisine, cooking traditions and local culture. These communal feasts are vibrant, welcoming occasions that provide an introduction to Salento&#x27;s cuisine. 

Salento is a major holiday destination for the Italian gay population, developing around the southern town of Gallipoli, the lidos at Baia Verde and nearby naturist beaches. Salento Pride is celebrated annually.

=== Coastal towers ===
The coastal towers in Salento are coastal watchtowers, as the peninsula&#x27;s coast was long subject to maritime attacks by the Saracens. The first towers may have been built by Normans. The remaining historic towers are mostly from the 15th and 16th centuries. Many are now in ruins.

<doc id="980126" wikidata="Q179377" url="?curid=980126" title="Humphead wrasse">
<text>The humphead wrasse (&quot;Cheilinus undulatus&quot;) is a large species of wrasse mainly found on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also known as the Māori wrasse, Napoleon wrasse, Napoleon fish, &quot;so mei&quot; 蘇眉 (Cantonese), &quot;mameng&quot; (Filipino), and &quot;merer&quot; in the Pohnpeian language of the Caroline Islands.

==Description==
The humphead wrasse is the largest extant member of the family Labridae. Males, typically larger than females, are capable of reaching up to 2 meters and weighing up to 180 kg, but the average length is a little less than 1 meter. Females rarely grow larger than one meter. This species can be easily identified by its large size, thick lips, two black lines behind its eyes, and the hump on the foreheads of larger adults. Its color can vary between dull blue-green to more vibrant shades of green and purplish-blue. Adults are usually observed living singly, but are also seen in male/female pairs and in small groups.
== Habitat ==
The humphead wrasses can be found on the east coast of Africa around the mouth of the Red Sea, and in some areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Juveniles are usually found in shallow, sandy ranges bordering coral reef waters, while adults are found mostly in offshore and deeper areas of coral reefs, typically in outer-reef slopes and channels, but also in lagoons.

==Reproduction==
The humphead wrasse is long-lived, but has a very slow breeding rate. Individuals become sexually mature at five to seven years, and are known to live for around 30 years. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, with some becoming male at about 9 years old. The factors controlling the timing of sex change are not yet known. At certain times of year, adults move to the down-current end of the reef and form local spawning aggregations (groups). They likely do not travel very far for their spawning aggregations.

The pelagic eggs and larvae ultimately settle on or near coral reef habitats. Eggs are 0.65 mm in diameter and spherical, with no pigment.

==Ecology==

Very opportunistic predators, &quot;C. undulatus&quot; preys primarily on invertebrates such as mollusks (particularly gastropods, as well as pelecypods, echinoids, crustaceans, and annelids) other fish, and even the highly venomous Crown-of-thorns starfish. Because half of echinoids and most pelecypods hide under the sand, wrasses may rely on fish excavators like stingrays, or they themselves may excavate by ejecting water to displace sand and nosing around for prey. Like many other Red Sea wrasses, humphead wrasses often crack sea urchins (echinoids) by carrying them to a rock in their mouths and striking them against the rock with brisk, sideways head movements.

They sometimes engage in cooperative hunting with the roving coral grouper.

Adults are commonly found on steep coral reef slopes, channel slopes, and lagoon reefs in water deep. 
The species actively selects branching hard and soft corals and seagrasses at settlement. Juveniles tend to prefer a more cryptic existence in areas of dense branching corals, bushy macroalgae, or seagrasses, while larger individuals and adults prefer limited home ranges in more open habitat on the edges of reefs, channels, and reef passes.

==Conservation==
The humphead wrasse is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list and in Appendix II of CITES. Its numbers have declined due to multiple threats, including: 
# Intensive, species-specific removal by the live reef food-fish trade throughout its core range in Southeast Asia
# Destructive fishing techniques, including bombs and cyanide 
# Habitat loss and degradation
# Local consumption, and its perception as a delicacy to locals and tourists
# A developing export market for juveniles for the marine aquarium trade
# Lack of coordinated, consistent national and regional management
# Inadequate knowledge of the species
# Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
Unsustainable and severe overfishing within the live reef food fish trade is the primary threat. Sabah, on Borneo Island, is a major source of humphead wrasses. The fishing industry is vital to this state because of its severe poverty. The export of humphead wrasses out of Sabah has led to a roughly 99% decline in the area&#x27;s population. In an effort to protect it, export of the humphead wrasse out of Sabah has been banned; however, it has not prevented illegal, unreported and unregulated activities. Protection by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is managed in this area by the federal Department of Fisheries Malaysia, which issues permits to regulate fishing activity. Two pieces of legislation have also been implemented to protect the species: The Fisheries Act 1985 controls the transport of live fish and prohibits destructive fishing techniques; and the International Trade in Endangered Species Act 2008 supports Malaysia&#x27;s adoption of CITES.

The humphead wrasse is considered an umbrella species, which means many other species are sympatric with it and have much smaller ranges—thus the conservation of the humphead wrasse&#x27;s habitat would benefit these other species as well. Understanding the concept of an umbrella species can lead to a better understanding of endangered species protection.

The humphead wrasse has historically been fished commercially in northern Australia, but has been protected in Queensland since 2003 and in Western Australia since 1998.

In Guangdong Province, southern mainland China, permits are required for the sale of the species. Indonesia allows fishing only for research, mariculture and licensed artisanal fishing. The Maldives instituted an export ban in 1995; Papua New Guinea prohibits export of fish over ; and Niue has banned all fishing for this species.

The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has classified the humphead wrasse as a species of concern—one about which it has concerns, but for which it has insufficient information to list under the Endangered Species Act.

In Taiwan it is a protected species with fines of between NT$300,000 and $1.5 million and jail sentences of between 6 months and 5 years under the Wildlife Conservation act for hunting or killing of the species having been added to the protection list in 2014.

== Population conservation by genetics ==

In 1996, following a decade of rapid population decline, the humphead wrasse was placed on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. The wrasse&#x27;s genomes must be analyzed to help keep the species alive.

Since so little was known about the wrasse&#x27;s genetic relationships at a geographical scale, researchers utilized a test using microsatellite loci to facilitate population genetic studies. (DNA markers could not be used for testing, as the humphead wrasse lack such markers.) Of the 15 microsatellite loci used in the test, only four seemed to have different outcomes than the other 11. These loci were all prone to null alleles. However, with the presence of these null alleles, the results may have been slightly biased, or they may be related to a particularity of the &quot;C. undulatus&quot;, which are highly restricted to coral reef habitats.

==Illegal, unregulated and unreported activities==
The Philippines, Indonesia, and Sabah Malaysia are the three largest exporters of the humphead wrasse. It has one of the highest retail values in Asia, especially when caught alive, and it is considered a delicacy in places like Malaysia. Illegal, unregulated, and unreported activities have been identified as the major factor for the failure of conservation efforts. Although the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has banned its export, the fish are still smuggled across the Malaysia–Philippines border.

Four main factors have allowed illegal, unregulated and unreported activities to persist: 
# Lack of capacity – A lack exists of formal procedures and personnel to monitor fishing activities and enforce fishing regulations
# Lack of disincentives – Fishers do not have alternatives for the humphead wrasse, due to its value, and sanctions for illegal fishing are not harsh enough to discourage them
# Weak accountability systems – Because a number of people are involved in the species&#x27;s trade, it is difficult to trace its source; and importers and consumers cannot be held responsible for illegal exportation.
# Absent domestic trade controls – Domestic catching, possession, and trade are not sufficiently restricted. Fishers may illegally source the fish or intend to illegally trade it, but cannot be prosecuted if they are in Malaysian waters with appropriate permits.

Most exports of the humphead wrasse in Malaysia occur in Sandakan, Papar, and Tawau, where the fish could recently be purchased for between US$45.30 and $69.43, with its retail price ranging from $60.38 to $120.36.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz A-Class is a subcompact car manufactured by Mercedes-Benz and marketed across fourth generations as a front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger, five-door hatchback, with a three-door hatchback offered for the second generation.

As the brand&#x27;s entry-level vehicle, the first generation A-Class, internally coded W168, was introduced in 1997, the second generation (W169) in late 2004 and the third generation (W176) in 2012. The fourth generation model (W177), which was launched in 2018, marked the first time the A-Class was offered in the United States and Canada. This fourth generation A-Class is also the first to be offered both as a hatchback (W177) and sedan (V177).

Styled by Steve Mattin and launched at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show, the A-Class was noted for its short, narrow footprint, its overall height, and an interior volume and level of equipment competing with larger cars. The A-Class subsequently gained length and width over its successive generations, losing some of its height. Approximately 3.3 million A-Class models had been manufactured by the 2021 model year. 


==First generation (W168; 1997)==

=== History ===
In 1994, Mercedes-Benz confirmed that it would be launching a compact car - the A-Class (A 160) - by early 1997, and (A 190) by early 1999, which would be the company&#x27;s first venture in this sector of the market; it was hinted at this stage that the new car would be shorter than the average supermini but as spacious and practical inside as a large family car.

The A-Class was presented to the motoring press late in 1996, and launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in the autumn of 1997, the W168 A-Class was quite unusual for Mercedes-Benz featuring a front-wheel drive layout and unusual tall but yet short body and Avantgarde at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show and 1999 Frankfurt Motor Show.

This was the first complete exterior designed by Coventry University trained Steve Mattin, for which he was named Autocar magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Designer of the Year&#x27;. Earlier, Mattin had mostly worked on design for the W210 E-Class in 1991. Concurrent to the W168, he designed the exterior of the W220 S-Class. The final design freeze occurred in January 1995, at 32 months before August 1997 start of production.

Between 1997 and 2004, 1.1 million first generation A-Class models had been sold. Overall, Daimler lost €1,440 per vehicle produced.

The A-Class was facelifted in February 2001, with minor alterations to the headlights, front and rear bumper design and the addition of a new longer wheelbase version. It was launched at the Geneva Motor Show.

=== Elk Test Issue/Recall ===
The W168 became infamous in 1997 after flipping over during the traditional &quot;elk test&quot; performed by the Swedish automobile publication &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot;. According to the report, the W168 overturned when manoeuvring to avoid the &quot;elk&quot;. Mercedes initially denied the problem, but then took the surprising step of recalling all units sold to date (2,600) and suspending sales for three months until the problem was solved by adding electronic stability control and modifying the suspension. The company spent DM 2.5 billion in developing the car, with a further DM 300 million to fix it.

=== Engines ===
All A-Class models are powered by four-cylinder engines, with 1.4 L and 1.6 L petrol models at launch (M 166 series), followed by two versions of a 1.7 L diesel engine (OM 668 series). In 1999, a larger 1.9 L petrol model was added, with the 2.1 the last W168 version to be launched in 2002. Also two AMG versions were produced, a 3.2 in 2001 and a 3.8 in 2000, though very few of these were made.

=== Safety ===
=== Production ===
DaimlerChrysler invested EUR 900 million in developing the Rastatt plant where the A-Class is produced, and created 1600 new jobs (for a total of 4700). A further 600 people work in the office building at the plant site.

Mercedes-Benz began W168 production on 17 February 1999 at its new Brazilian facility in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais. The Brazilian plant was the company&#x27;s first factory in South America dedicated to passenger cars, with an investment of US$840 million and 10,000 employees. The factory initially produced A-Class and C-Class models, assembling them from pieces manufactured in Germany. The target for the cars was regional markets (from Argentina to Mexico) with modifications made to the cars to suit local conditions, like a protection for the motor base. By May 2004 production stopped in Rastatt plant. In September 2005 Brazilian Juiz de Fora factory stopped production of A-Class cars.

==== Mercedes-Benz A-Class &quot;F-Cell&quot; (2004–) ====

It is a version of 5-door A-Class hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with electric motor. It has a driving range of .

Three A-Class F-Cell cars were used in the 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show for press shuttle service. On 18 June 2004, 4 production F-Cell vehicles were delivered to Deutsche Telekom and BEWAG/Vattenfall Europe in Berlin.

In 2007, the A-Class F-Cell were delivered to Landsvirkjun and Reykjavik Energy.

A DHL version of F-Cell was unveiled in FC EXPO 2008.

=== Reception ===
According to a 2008 British satisfaction survey by &quot;Which?&quot;, the A-Class came third from bottom out of 217 models surveyed with a score of 65 percent.

== Second generation (W169; 2004) ==

=== Initial release ===
The W169 is constructed with high-strength steel alloys with bonded joints. Standard equipment included front as well as combined head and thorax-protection side airbags. The front airbags are adaptive with two-stage gas generators operating according to the severity of accident. Optionally rear side airbags (for side-impacts in the backseats) and side-curtain airbags were available.

The force exerted by the seat belt system during a collision adapts dynamically to collision characteristics. The &#x27;active&#x27; head restraints (standard for driver and front passenger) reduce neck injury, especially in rear collisions.

The cargo capacity of the W169 was increased by 15 percent over the W168.

Seven four-cylinder engines were available: four petrol (gasoline) (A 150, A 170, A 200, A 200 Turbo) and three diesel (A 160 CDI, A 180 CDI, A 200 CDI) partnered with either five- or six-speed manual gearbox. A continuously variable transmission system called &quot;Autotronic Constantly Variable Transmission&quot; (CVT) is an optional feature.

The petrol A 200 Turbo provides and of torque (rotational force); the diesel A 200 CDI has and .

The most powerful engine achieved 0- in 8.0 seconds with a top speed of .
The newly developed direct-injection CDI diesel units use a common-rail direct injection system that improves fuel consumption and reduces exhaust emissions and engine noise.

All the engines meet the tight EU4 emissions limits. A particulate filter system is available as an option for the diesel units to reduce particulate emissions by about 99% without the need for additives.

The A-Class is a front wheel drive car and features traction control (ASR) as standard, as well as electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes (ABS).

Handling is improved by precision tracking and anti-roll support, and by a Parabolic Rear Axle.

A &quot;Selective Damping System&quot;, in which the shock absorber forces respond differently according to conditions, is standard. For example, under normal conditions it operates at soft absorption; while cornering at speed it changes to full damping force.

Sales of the W169 were targeted at 50,000 units in 2004. Dr. Joachim Schmidt, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing, Mercedes Car Group, said that target had been reached even before vehicles arrived in dealer showrooms.

Japan models went on sale in 2005-02-04. Early models include 5-door right drive versions of A 170, A 170 Elegance, A 200 Elegance. 5-door right drive version of A 200 TURBO Elegance was added in 2005-11-10. Due to the body width being larger than 1700 mm, it could not be registered as small car in Japan. (See Vehicle size class#Japan)

=== 2008 update ===
The W169 Model facelift changes included redesigned front and rear fascias and lights, and optional stop-start function on A 150 and 170 models. Active Park Assist enables the car to parallel park itself, with only throttle and brake inputs required from the driver.

The five-door Hatchback and the three-door Coupé vehicles debuted in spring 2008, alongside the refreshed 2009 M-Class and B-Class. Early models include A 160 CDI, A 180 CDI, A 200 CDI, A 150, A 170, A 200, A 200 TURBO.

Japan models went on sale in late August 2008. Early models 5-door versions of A 170, A 170 Elegance. Japan models of A 170 was renamed to A 180 in August 2009.

==== A-Class Special Edition 2009 (2009) ====
The Special Edition is a limited (5500 units) version for all model variants of the A-Class. It includes the BlueEfficiency package, black radiator louvres, 16-inch titanium silver light-alloy wheels in a new 9-spoke design (tyre size 195/55 R16), a &quot;Special Edition&quot; badge on the mirror triangle, two-tone colour scheme in black and grey, Audio 20 radio with CD player and Bluetooth hands-free system and the Light and Sight package with a rain sensor, automatically dimming rear-view mirror, an illuminated vanity mirror in the sun visor, separately adjustable reading lights in the rear, a reading light for the driver and illuminated front foot wells, Seating Comfort package (height-adjustable front passenger seat, seat cushion angle adjustment and lumbar supports for the driver and front passenger). Standard exterior features also include fog lamps and a free choice of metallic paint finish.

==== Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-CELL (2010) ====
The Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-CELL was introduced in September 2010 and debuted at the October 2010 Paris Motor Show. The E-Cell has a range of capable of developing a peak output of , a continuous power rating of and a maximum torque of 290 N·m (214 lb·ft). The Mercedes A-Class E-Cell can accelerate from 0–60 km/h (37 mph) in 5.5 seconds, and its top speed is .

Tesla Motors, as part of its collaboration with Mercedes-Benz, built electric powertrain components for the E-Cell. The 36 kWh battery contains approximately 4,000 individual lithium-ion cells. Mercedes has developed a modular system for electric vehicles with battery and fuel-cell. This system allows the efficient use of shared parts in all the brand&#x27;s electric vehicles. Thanks to the modular approach the electric drive of the A‑Class E‑Cell is also used in the B‑Class F‑Cell, and the energy storage units in the A‑Class EV are the same as the battery in the Smart fortwo electric drive.

A limited production of 500 A-Class E-Cell electric cars will be built, for trial purposes, at the Mercedes Rastatt plant, near Stuttgart beginning in September 2010. As part of a demonstration program, the cars will be leased to selected customers in several European countries, including Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Daimler is not planning to sell the electric version outside Europe.

==== A 180 Final Edition (2012) ====
The Final Edition is a limited (300 units) version of 5-door righthand drive A 180 for the Japanese market. It included calcite white body colour, black interior colour, sport package (chrome exhaust tip, 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels, chrome iridium silver front grille, stainless acceleration and brake pedals with rubber stud, leather wrapped sport steering wheel and silver shift knob, silver meter panel), bi-xenon headlights and headlight washer, cornering lights, fog lamps (front/rear), rain sensor, sun visor with illuminating mirror, anti-glare mirrors, &#x27;Final Edition&#x27; emblem, and floor mats with &#x27;Final Edition&#x27; silver logo plates.

The vehicle went on sale on 28 May 2012.

=== Technical data ===


=== Production ===
As of 4 December 2006, 371,700 second generation A-Class units had been sold since September 2004, making it a total of 1,500,000 A-Class produced at DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s Rastatt plant in ten years.

As of 26 June 2009, the 750,000th second generation A-Class vehicle was built at the Rastatt plant.

As of 1 February 2012, 1 million second generation A-Class vehicles had been delivered since autumn 2004.

In 2021, the Mercedes A-Class achieved the title of 4th best-selling car in the UK having achieved a total of 30,710 registrations.

== Third generation (W176; 2012) ==
The model was introduced at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show officially as a subcompact executive / C-segment model for the first time after being a supermini / B-segment for fifteen years. This model does not offer a 3-door model, due to the decreasing popularity of 3-door models and its larger size. The W176 was available in some markets from September 2012. Models in the Japanese market went on sale in January 2013.

The design for the third generation of A-Class was based on the 2011 Concept A-Class and was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The facelifted model of the W176 was presented in Q3 2015. Orders for the facelifted model had started in July 2015, and mass production started in September. The facelift had added updated lights, technology, and models. The model was initially built exclusively in Rastatt. However, from late 2013 it was also built in Uusikaupunki, Finland for certain countries.

== Fourth generation (W177; 2018) ==
The W177 hatchback was launched in 2018 as the successor to the W176 Mercedes-Benz A-Class and sales commenced in March 2018. It is available as a 5-door hatchback (W177 model code), 4-door sedan (V177), and a long-wheelbase sedan exclusive to China (Z177). In North America, the hatchback is available in Canada and Mexico, but in the US, only the sedan is available.

The fourth generation A-Class hatchback was unveiled to media in February 2018 in Amsterdam ahead of its public debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. At launch Mercedes-Benz revealed the vehicle&#x27;s &quot;predator face&quot;, which is also implemented in the C257 CLS and C118 CLA, which will not spread throughout the brand&#x27;s entire range of cars.

<doc id="980128" wikidata="Q2668352" url="?curid=980128" title="Mock Turtle">
<text>The Mock Turtle is a fictional character devised by Lewis Carroll from his popular 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Its name is taken from a dish that was popular in the Victorian period, mock turtle soup.

==&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;==
Carroll enjoyed such puns on Victorian fashions and etiquette, and showed this frequently. The description and drawing by John Tenniel gives comedic value to the Mock Turtle, as he is clearly an assemblage of creatures, therefore not a real turtle as his name rightly suggests.

Alice encounters the Mock Turtle with the Gryphon. The Mock Turtle is a very melancholic character, his somber attitude is believed to be a result of him having been a real turtle. He tells Alice his history of going to school in the sea. He says his teacher was an old sea turtle called Tortoise and when Alice asks him why he was called Tortoise if he was a turtle the Mock Turtle answers, &quot;We called him tortoise because he taught us!&quot; (&quot;tortoise&quot; and &quot;taught us&quot; both being pronounced in Carroll&#x27;s dialect).

==Media incarnations==
* The Mock Turtle appeared in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1931) played by Gus Alexander.
* The Mock Turtle appeared in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933) played by Cary Grant.
* When it came to the development of Disney&#x27;s animated &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), the Mock Turtle was planned to appear. However, the Mock Turtle alongside the Jabberwock and the Gryphon were discarded for pacing reasons. The Mock Turtle did appear in a Disney commercial with Alice and the Gryphon.
* The Mock Turtle appeared in &quot;The Hall of Fame&quot; (1955) episode &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; played by the puppeteer Burr Tillstrom.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (1965) episode &quot;Alice&quot; played by Norman Scace. He later appeared in the episode &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; played by John Gielgud.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1972) played by Michael Hordern.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Alicja&quot; (1982) played by Jack Wild.
* The Mock Turtle appears in the &quot;Great Performances&quot; (1983) episode &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; played by Donald O&#x27;Connor.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1985) (TV) played by Ringo Starr.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Dreamchild&quot; (1985) performed by Steve Whitmire and voiced by Alan Bennett. The Mock Turtle, along with the Gryphon, are the first Wonderland characters encountered in the dreams and imaginations of the now elderly Alice Hargreaves. The perpetually sobbing turtle symbolizes the Rev. Charles Dodgson (who stutteringly performs the character&#x27;s song to a young adult Alice&#x27;s derision). After making her peace with Dodgson&#x27;s memory, following an Oxford University choir&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Mock Turtle Song,&quot; Alice dreams again, with Dodgson in a crouching position akin to that of the turtle. The grinning Dodgson turns around, and joins Alice and the Gryphon in joyous laughter. The mock turtle himself, however, remains morose, prompting his companion to tell him to shut up.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1986) (TV) played by Roy Skelton.
* The Mock Turtle appears in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1999) (TV) played by Gene Wilder. This version eschews the bovine elements and is portrayed as a man in a turtle&#x27;s shell, rendering the name meaningless.
*The Mock Turtle appears in the Sunsoft&#x27;s 2006 mobile game . He is the head chef employed by the Queen of Hearts and tries to cook Ariko (the &quot;Alice&quot; of the game), but is stopped by the Queen.
* The Mock Turtle makes an appearance in the computer game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, having the head of a bull and the body of a turtle. In the beginning, Alice has to help the Mock Turtle find his shell, which was stolen by the Duchess.
* In the sequel &quot;&quot; he is a ship&#x27;s captain and helps Alice reach the Carpenter&#x27;s underwater theater. 
* There is a creature called a Mock Turtle in &quot;The Elder Scrolls Legends: Battlespire&quot;.

* In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), the Mock Turtle does not appear, but a portrait of him can be seen clearly in the Hatter&#x27;s room to the left of the Knave when he breaks in.
* The Mock Turtle appeared in the &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot; episode &quot;Trust Me&quot;. In this show, the Mock Turtle is a giant aquatic turtle that is as large as a small island (somewhat similar to the turtle variation of the Aspidochelone). Alice and the Knave of Hearts end up on it after being dropped by Silvermist. Upon this discovery, Alice takes advantage of this and commands the Mock Turtle to take it to the other side of the lake.
* The Mock Turtle appears in Marissa Meyer&#x27;s novel &quot;Heartless&quot; in which we get to see the reason for his transformation from turtle to mock turtle.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Mock Turtle&quot; was the name of a costumed criminal obsessed with Alice in Wonderland and other fantasies in the &quot;Astro City&quot; universe (as a possible reference to DC Comics&#x27; similarly Wonderland-obsessed villain, the Mad Hatter).
* In the 1940 screwball comedy film &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, Cary Grant&#x27;s character Walter Burns shouts at another character, &quot;Get back in there, you Mock Turtle!&quot; Grant had played the Mock Turtle in the 1933 &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.
* Steely Dan recorded a demo entitled &quot;The Mock Turtle Song;&quot; this song was never recorded for a studio album but has been released on compilations and the band has played it live. The lyrics were directly taken from a song in the section in the book (&quot;The Lobster Quadrille&quot;).
* Jazz fusion band Bruford recorded a song entitled &quot;Fainting in Coils,&quot; which is included as the fifth track of the band&#x27;s 1979 release &quot;One of a Kind&quot;. The song includes narration by Sam Alder, Anthea Norman Taylor and band founder Bill Bruford as the Mock Turtle, consisting of a 74-word excerpt from &quot;The Mock Turtle&#x27;s Story.&quot; In this excerpt, the Mock Turtle tells Alice about some of things he studied in school, which among other things included &quot;...Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.&quot;
*The Mock Turtles are an English indie rock band. Their most famous song &quot;Can You Dig It?,&quot; which was released in the UK in 1991, charted at number 18; and then, slightly remixed, it again reached number 18 when re-released in 2003.
*Mock Turtle characters appear in the 1994 video game &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VII&quot; and the 1997 video game &quot;An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire&quot;.

<text>Woodley is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Wokingham, in Berkshire, England. Woodley is east of Reading and adjoined to Earley which is to the west of the town and Woodley is from Wokingham. Nearby are the villages of Sonning, Twyford, Winnersh, Hurst and Charvil.
Woodley is the largest town in Berkshire without a railway station.

==History==
The toponym Woodley is derived from Old English words meaning &quot;a clearing in the wood&quot;. Anciently, Woodley was part of the ecclesiastical parish of Sonning. Woodley was not mentioned in the Domesday Book. The first written record of the name was in The Register of St Osmund, which is housed in the archives of Salisbury Cathedral. St Osmund was Bishop of Salisbury between 1074 and 1099. The document states that St Osmund visited Sonning and says: &quot;Osbertus de Woodleghe holds a dwelling house and yard and is able to pasture his pigs on the Lord of the Manor&#x27;s woods&quot;. The 1550 Survey of Sonning, housed in Berkshire Record Office, includes the first modern spelling of the name Woodley. In the west of Woodley, Old Bulmershe Manor once belonged to the Abbey of Reading but was later the home of the Blagrave family and probable birthplace of the 17th-century mathematician, John Blagrave. The adjoining house of Bulmershe Court, otherwise Woodley Lodge, was built in 1777 by James Wheble. Bulmershe (also spelled Bullmarsh) Heath was a marshy area where bulls were pastured. The annual Reading Races were held from 1727 to 1814 on Bulmershe Heath. Horses were entered for the races at The Mitre Tavern in Reading. Owners living in Berkshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire could enter horses. The races were advertised in The Reading Mercury newspaper and ran every August. After 1814 they moved to Kings Meadow in Reading. In the 1820 enclosure of lands in Woodley, the two major landowners were James Wheble of Woodley Lodge and Robert Palmer of Holme Park in Sonning. People lost their rights to cut furze for fuel, catch rabbits and pasture their animals on Bulmershe Heath. In compensation, they were given the Poor&#x27;s Gardens which were allotments on Headley Road.

Woodley Lodge, later known as Bulmershe Court, was bought by Henry Addington, who lived there every summer 1790–1801. He was Speaker of the House of Commons and later 1801–1804 Prime Minister. He was a friend of William Pitt the Younger. Addington was the Captain Commandant of Woodley Yeomanry, a volunteer cavalry regiment formed by gentlemen and wealthy farmers who owned horses. King George III reviewed Woodley Yeomanry on Bulmershe Heath in 1799 and 1805. Addington became Viscount Sidmouth in 1805. He and his wife gave land on which the Royal Berkshire Hospital was built. His name is remembered in Addington Gardens and Addington School in Woodley. In the Second World War the house was used by the US Army. In the 1960s it was demolished and replaced by a teacher training college that subsequently become part of the University of Reading in 1989. The area was sold in 2013/2014 and is now a new housing estate of houses, flats and a care home.

The 1847 Kelly&#x27;s Directory of Berkshire described Woodley as &quot; a scattered village and consists principally of farm houses. James Wheble has a neat residence here called Bulmershe Court. There is a market for fat cattle, held at Loddon Bridge every Monday, which is well attended by butchers from Reading and the vicinity&quot;. The directory listed the main farmers, public houses and tradesmen. The pubs were The Bull and Chequers at Woodley Green, The Chequers at Bulmershe Heath, The Lands End and The George at Loddon Bridge.

===Woodley Aerodrome===
Until the 1930s Woodley was a village of little significance. In 1929, Woodley Aerodrome was opened in a field belonging to Sandford Farm. Jack Phillips and Charles Powis started a business The Phillips and Powis School of Flying, offering flying lessons at 12s 6d each. Pauline Gower, later Commander of the Women&#x27;s Air Transport Auxiliary, earned her pilot&#x27;s licence there in September 1930. Flight magazine of 10 May 1933 advertised &quot;Learn to Fly for £37 irrespective of the total number of hours taken&quot; at the P and P School of Flying. The short-lived Berks, Bucks and Oxon Flying Club and the Reading Aero Club were also based at the Aerodrome.

In 1932 F.G. Miles came to Woodley and Charles Powis agreed &quot;to place at Mr Miles&#x27; disposal a newly equipped Aircraft Workshop&quot;. F.G. Miles was joined by his wife Blossom who was a skilled designer and took an active role in the business. In 1936 his brother George joined the company. Phillips left the company in 1932 and Powis in 1937. The first major success for the company was the Miles Hawk aeroplane, a wooden monoplane which sold for £395. Flying was a hobby for the rich, but this was the most affordable civilian plane of the time. Designed by modernist architect Guy Morgan, the Falcon Hotel was built in 1937 to accommodate visitors and serve as a new accommodation for the Reading Aero Club.

The company name was Phillips and Powis until 1943 when it was changed to Miles Aircraft Ltd. Two of the firm&#x27;s most famous aeroplanes were the Magister and the Master which were used for basic training of RAF pilots. In the years before the war numerous aviators visited Woodley, including Charles Lindbergh and Amy Johnson; Douglas Bader lost his legs in a flying accident on the airfield in 1931. He was in the RAF and had been forbidden from doing low level stunts because of the danger. He recorded the accident in his log book &quot; Crashed slow-rolling near ground. Bad show&quot;. The Reading Mercury reported the eyewitness testimony of Captain R.L. Bateman, who was chief instructor at the Aerodrome &quot;I was in the clubhouse when I heard the machine flying overhead. I looked out and saw that the pilot was about 200 feet above the ground. At the time, his machine was going into a slow roll and I was rather surprised at such a thing with the machine at that height. I do not think that the pilot realised that he was so low. At any rate, as he came off his back he lost height and speed and pancaked into the ground. The engine came away from the machine whilst the machine itself rolled over for some distance. The pilot was extracted within a couple of minutes of his machine touching the ground. We did not know the pilot at Woodley and we have no idea why he came here&quot;. Bader was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital and operated on by the chief surgeon Mr Joyce. His legs could not be saved and both were amputated. He was fitted with tin legs and had to learn to walk again. Bader became a famous pilot and his story is told in the book and film Reach For The Sky. He was always grateful to the Royal Berkshire Hospital and helped them with fund-raising. In 1956 he returned to Woodley to open The Coronation Hall, the community hall which replaced the old village Hut.

From 1935 a civilian flying school was operated by the Philips and Powis company, where trainees were prepared for service in the RAF. The company won a £2M Air Ministry order for 500 M.9 Master Is on 11 June 1938 and this was Britain&#x27;s largest order for training aeroplanes at the time and required considerable and urgent expansion of the busy factory later that year. By 1939 Phillips and Powis had 1,000 employees and major extensions to the factory and an impressive new &#x27;art deco&#x27; headquarters designed by Guy Morgan were officially opened by Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood on 27 January 1939. When war broke out that September, the airfield and factory buildings were camouflaged and the grass runways were disguised by false hedges. The nearby &#x27;Eleven Elms&#x27; were cut down because it was feared they were a landmark which could identify the Aerodrome. In 1940 the company was awarded a Spitfire repair and service contract and at the height of World War Two there was a 24-hour 7 day working week and 5,000 employees and many dispersed production and storage sites around the local area. The RAF formed No. 10 Flying Instructors&#x27; School in 1942 from the former No. 8 Elementary Flying Training School. The aerodrome was bombed three times in 1940 but the damage was minor and there were no deaths.

Around 6,000 civil and military aircraft were built and first flown here from 1933 to 1962 and, in 1939, the Phillips &amp; Powis factory installed Britain&#x27;s first moving track assembly line for aircraft production, to build the Miles Master advanced training aeroplane. After the Second World War, Woodley continued to grow, with other industries relocating here from Reading. By early the 1960s the aerodrome was little-used and all flying finally ceased soon after the Handley Page (Reading) Ltd aircraft factory closed in 1962-63. After gravel extraction in the 1960s and 70s, aerodrome was redeveloped for housing and light industry by Adwest Properties Ltd in the 1980s. The Adwest Group and its tenants continued to use many of the former Miles aircraft factory buildings into the 21st century. Today, Woodley&#x27;s aviation heritage is mainly commemorated by the Museum of Berkshire Aviation and also many aviation-related road names on the former aerodrome.

==Government==
The Office for National Statistics places Woodley within the Reading Urban Area, but for purposes of local government it is in the unitary authority of Wokingham, and outside the area of Reading Borough Council. Woodley is a civil parish with town status (adopted in 1974) and an elected town council. The town council and unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government. Woodley was previously divided between the Reading East and Maidenhead parliamentary constituencies, until 2024 when boundary changes led to the whole town becoming part of the new Earley and Woodley constituency.

==Landmarks==
Woodley Congregational church is a Gothic Revival building completed in 1834. It became a United Reformed Church and is now offices. Church of St John the Evangelist was designed by Henry Woodyer, paid for by Robert Palmer of Holme Park and built in 1873. Woodley was a made separate ecclesiastical parish in 1881.

==Education==
Woodley has two secondary comprehensive schools that have achieved specialist school status, Waingels College (Mathematics and Computing), and The Bulmershe School (Sports). Primary schools include ones at Highwood, Beechwood, St Dominic&#x27;s Roman Catholic, Rivermead, Woodley Church of England, Southlake and Willow Bank.

==Geography==
Woodley has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the east of the town, called Lodge Wood and Sandford Mill The town has three local nature reserves, and they are called Alder Moors, Highwood and Lavells Lake.

==Sport==
Woodley&#x27;s football team is Woodley United F.C. The club was formed in 1904, though it is thought that a team existed in Woodley in the nineteenth century. In 2009, Woodley Town ran three teams in the Reading Football League. The 1st team won the Senior Division in 2008–09 (Step 7 of the FA Football Pyramid System) and the BTC Senior Cup to complete the League and Cup double. It is a FA Charter Standard Development Club. The club runs a youth section, Woodley Town Kestrels, with boys and girls teams from under-7 to under-17 age groups.

Woodley is home to the Kingfisher Table Tennis Club, who play in the Reading &amp; District League and the Bracknell, Wokingham &amp; District League. Kingfisher TTC also participate in the British League. In 2019 Maria Tsaptsinos of Kingfisher won the England championship title. Southlake Angling Society runs the Southlake fishery near Woodley town centre. It was established in the early 1960s on the former estate lake with which it shares its name. The Society has added Redlands, a local lake in Hurst, and a stretch of the River Loddon that flows close to the east of Woodley and Earley. There is a park run in Woodford park every Saturday, and a junior park run every Sunday.

<text>Enno Friedrich Wichard Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (22 December 1848 – 25 September 1931) was a German classical philologist. Wilamowitz, as he is known in scholarly circles, was a renowned authority on Ancient Greece and its literature.

== Life ==

=== Youth ===
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was born in Markowitz (Markowice), a small village near Hohensalza (Inowrocław), in the then Province of Posen (now part of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship), to a Germanized family of distant Polish ancestry. His father, a Prussian Junker, was Arnold Wilamowitz, of Szlachta origin and using the Ogończyk coat of arms, while his mother was Ulrika, née Calbo. The couple settled in a small manor confiscated from a local noble in 1836. The Prussian part of their name, von Moellendorf, was acquired in 1813 when Prussian field marshal Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf adopted Ulrich&#x27;s ancestors. Wilamowitz, a third child, grew up in East Prussia.

In 1867 Wilamowitz passed his &quot;Abitur&quot; at the renowned boarding school at Schulpforta. Here he was educated and learned, amongst the rest, the English language, also studying privately with Dietrich Volkmann, teacher and then Master of the school.

=== Studies ===
Until 1869, he studied Classical Philology at the University of Bonn. His teachers, Otto Jahn and Hermann Usener, had a formative influence on him. Willamowitz&#x27;s relationship with Usener was strained. He developed a lifelong rivalry with his fellow student Friedrich Nietzsche and a close friendship with his contemporary Hermann Diels.

Together with Diels, he moved to Berlin in 1869, where he graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy cum laude in 1870. After voluntary service in the Franco-Prussian War, he embarked on a study tour to Italy and Greece.

=== Conflict with Nietzsche and Wagner ===
Even before he gained a professorial title, Wilamowitz was a member of a scholarly dispute about Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Tragedy&quot; that attracted much attention. In 1872–73, he published two unusually aggressive polemics (German: &quot;Zukunftsphilologie&quot;, i.e. &quot;Philology of the future&quot;), which strongly attacked Nietzsche (then Professor at the University of Basel) and Professor Erwin Rohde (University of Kiel). Richard Wagner, whose views on art had influenced Nietzsche and Rohde, reacted by publishing an open letter and Rohde wrote a damning response. The issue at stake was the deprecation of Euripides, on whom Nietzsche blamed the destruction of Greek tragedy. Wilamowitz saw the methods of his adversaries as an attack on the basic tenets of scientific thought, unmasking them as enemies of the scientific method. His polemic was considered as Classical philology&#x27;s reply to Nietzsche&#x27;s challenge.

At the age of 80 when Wilamowitz wrote his memoirs, he saw the conflict with Nietzsche less passionately but did not retract the essential points of his critique. He stated that he had not fully realised at the time that Nietzsche was not interested in scientific understanding but rather in Wagner&#x27;s musical drama, but also that he was nevertheless right to take his position against Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;rape of historical facts and all historical method&quot;.

=== Greifswald ===

In 1875, he gained a professorial title for his study &quot;Analecta Euripidea&quot;. In the same year, he gave his first public academic lecture in Berlin. In 1876, he was employed as &quot;Ordinarius&quot; (full professor) for Classical Philology at Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität at Greifswald. During this period, he also married Marie Mommsen, the eldest daughter of Theodor Mommsen, and published &quot;Homeric Studies&quot; (&quot;Homerische Studien&quot;).

=== Göttingen ===
In 1883, he took a further professorial position at Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen. Here, he continued to teach Classical Philology but also gave replacement lectures in Ancient History. His influence ensured the employment of his Greifswald colleague, Julius Wellhausen, in Göttingen. In 1891, he became vice-chancellor of the university, and he was appointed a member of Göttingen&#x27;s Royal Academy of Sciences one year later. When Wilamowitz left Göttingen, he was succeeded by Georg Kaibel, a close associate from his student days and his successor at Greifswald.

=== Berlin ===
In 1897, with the support of his friend Diels, Wilamowitz was offered a position at the Royal Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität at Berlin, as successor to Ernst Curtius. He stayed until his retirement in 1921. In 1915, he was appointed chancellor of the university for one year. Together with Diels, he founded the Berlin Institute for Ancient Studies (&quot;Institut für Altertumskunde&quot;) in 1897. His public lectures on subjects of Classical antiquity, which took place twice a week, attracted large audiences.

=== Teaching activities and memberships ===
In 1891, Wilamowitz was elected a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and he was a full member from 1899. In 1902 he took the academy&#x27;s presidency. As a member of the Göttingen Academy, he strongly encouraged the publication of the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot;. From 1897 he also worked as a member of the academy&#x27;s Commission for Patristics. In 1894 he was elected full member of the German Archaeological Institute. He also was editor of the series &quot;Philologische Untersuchungen&quot; from 1880 to 1925.

Further, Wilamowitz taught as a guest lecturer in Oxford (1908) and Uppsala (1912), was a corresponding member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1909) and the Scientific Society of Lund (1921).
===&quot;Inscriptiones Graecae&quot;===
During his presidency of the Prussian Academy, Wilamowitz oversaw the continuation of August Böckh&#x27;s and Adolf Kirchhoff&#x27;s publication series, the &quot;Inscriptiones Graecae&quot;. Wilamowitz had a formative influence on the further development of that project, which he directed until his death.

=== World War I ===
Wilamowitz was an initiator of the memorandum &quot;Erklärung der Hochschullehrer des Deutschen Reiches&quot; (&quot;Declaration by the University Teachers of the German Reich&quot;), in which 3,016 signatories supported German participation in the First World War. Shortly after, he also signed the &quot;Manifesto of the Ninety-Three&quot;, from which he distanced himself later. In 1914, his son, Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who was also active as a classical philologist, fell in the battle of Ivangorod. The memorandum appeared a few days later.

=== Family ===
In 1878, he married Maria Mommsen, the eldest daughter of the famous ancient historian, Theodor Mommsen, whom he actively assisted in the completion of his &quot;Roman History&quot;.

Wilamowitz spent his last years in seclusion, suffering from severe kidney problems. He died in Berlin on 25 September 1931, having been in a coma for a short time. He is buried in his native village, along with his wife, Maria (1855–1936), and their only son, Tycho. He also had a daughter, Dorothea Freifrau Hiller von Gaertringen, wife of archaeologist Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen, who died on 24 March 1972.

== Achievements ==
Wilamowitz is one of the central figures of 19th and 20th century Classical philology. As a great authority on the literature and history of Ancient Greece, Wilamowitz took a stance against traditional methodology and textual criticism. As a representative of Postclassicism, he concentrated less on literary history but rather aimed to extract biographical information on the respective authors from the preserved texts. Thus, he employed historical perspectives to serve philology.

Apart from his seminal general works (&quot;Greek Literature from Antiquity&quot;, &quot;Hellenistic Poetry&quot;), he published numerous detailed studies of Euripides, Homer, Aeschylus, Pindar and Aristotle. As a scientific organiser, he was also responsible for the publication of important standard-setting source material publications, such as &quot;Inscriptiones Graecae&quot;.

He also passionately supported the preservation of Classical education in the German school system.

Notable pupils of his include Felix Jacoby, Karl Mittelhaus, Wolfgang Schadewaldt, Eduard Fraenkel, Werner Jaeger, Johannes Geffcken, Paul Maas, Eduard Schwartz, Gilbert Murray, Paul Friedländer, Friedrich Solmsen and Johannes Sykutris.

In recent decades, the American scholar William M. Calder III has been publishing a series of important documents about and by Wilamowitz, including much of his correspondence with Diels, Eduard Norden, Mommsen, Paul Wendland, and others.

<text>The Mississippi embayment is a physiographic feature in the south-central United States, part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. It is essentially a northward continuation of the fluvial sediments of the Mississippi River Delta to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois. The current sedimentary area was formed in the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic by the filling with sediment of a pre-existing basin. An explanation for the embayment&#x27;s formation was put forward by Van Arsdale and Cox in 2007: movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust brought this region over a volcanic &quot;hotspot&quot; in the Earth&#x27;s mantle causing an upthrust of magma which formed the Appalachian-Ouachita range. Subsequent erosion caused a deep trough that was flooded by the Gulf of Mexico and eventually filled with sediment from the Mississippi River.

==Geography==

The embayment is a topographically low-lying basin that is filled with Cretaceous to recent sediments. The northern end of the embayment appears as an anomalous break in regional geologic structure with Paleozoic sedimentary rocks both to the east in Kentucky and Tennessee and to the west in Missouri and Arkansas. The current sedimentary basin results from the filling of a Cretaceous tectonic basin and existed as a large bay in the Cretaceous through early Cenozoic shoreline.

The New Madrid Seismic Zone lies at the northern end of the embayment. It was the site of the large New Madrid earthquakes of 1811-12. The area is underlain by some anomalous geology. The Reelfoot Rift is an ancient failed continental rift, an aulacogen, which dates back to the Precambrian break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia. The more recent opening of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico during late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic break-up of Pangea no doubt affected and may have partially re-activated the old rift.

==Formation of the embayment==

The Mississippi embayment represents a break in what was once a single, continuous mountain range comprising the modern Appalachian range, which runs roughly on a north–south axis along the Atlantic coast of the United States, and the Ouachita range, which runs on a rough east–west axis west of the Mississippi River. The ancestral Appalachian-Ouachita range was thrust up when the tectonic plate carrying North America came into contact with the plates carrying South America and Africa when all three became joined in the ancient supercontinent Pangaea about 300 million years ago.

As Pangaea began to break up about 200 million years ago, North America passed over a volcanic &quot;hotspot&quot; in the Earth&#x27;s mantle (specifically, the Bermuda hotspot) that was undergoing a period of intense activity. The upwelling of magma from the hotspot forced the further uplift to a height of perhaps 2–3 km of part of the Appalachian-Ouachita range, forming an arch. The uplifted land quickly eroded and, as North America moved away from the hot spot and as the hotspot&#x27;s activity declined, the crust beneath the embayment region cooled, contracted and subsided to a depth of 2.6 km, forming a trough that was flooded by the Gulf of Mexico. As sea levels dropped, the Mississippi and other rivers extended their courses into the embayment, which gradually became filled with sediment.

Evidence for this explanation is found in the presence of the seismic zones centered on New Madrid, Missouri, and Charleston, South Carolina, each the source of devastating earthquakes in the 19th century, and in diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes in Arkansas, which are products of volcanism.

<doc id="980138" wikidata="Q1009534" url="?curid=980138" title="Bunkai">
<text>, literally meaning &quot;analysis&quot; or &quot;disassembly&quot;, &quot;is a term used in Japanese martial arts referring to process of analysing kata and extracting fighting techniques from the movements of a &#x27;form&#x27; (&quot;kata&quot;). The extracted fighting techniques are called &quot;Oyo&quot;.&quot;

==Process==
Bunkai is usually performed with a partner or a group of partners which execute predefined attacks, and the student performing the &quot;kata&quot; responds with defenses, counterattacks, or other actions, based on a part of the &quot;kata&quot;. This allows the student in the middle to understand what the movements in &quot;kata&quot; are meant to accomplish. It also illustrates how to improve the technique by adjusting distances (Maai), timing, rhythm (Ritsudo) and fluidity (Nagare) in combat properly, in order to adapt and adjust any technique depending on the size of an opponent.

Some &quot;kata&quot; have another layer of application that is taught using an &quot;Oyo Bunkai&quot;, an &quot;application of the kata in ways other than the standard bunkai.&quot; Different practitioners will learn or discover alternative applications, but the bunkai, like the &quot;kata&quot;, varies based on the style and the teacher. 

A single &quot;kata&quot; posture or movement may be broken into anywhere from a few to a few dozen applications, and the same sequence of &quot;kata&quot; moves may sometimes be interpreted in different ways resulting in several bunkai. Students are encouraged to consider each movement and technique in a kata in response to multiple possible attacks, for example: use of a particular movement against a kick, against a punch, against various forms of grappling. Through analysis of the move and practice in variant scenarios, the student will unlock new techniques and expand their understanding of known ones. Some martial arts require students to perform bunkai for promotion.

Bunkai can be obvious or elusive depending on the technique in question, the moves preceding and following it, and the individual practitioner. There are usually many stages of depth of comprehension of bunkai only reached through the passage of time. The terms &quot;toridai&quot; and &quot;himitsu&quot; are used to refer to techniques not readily seen to the casual observer and hidden techniques within &quot;kata&quot;. For example, in Gōjū-ryū karate, two-man &quot;kata&quot; training is used to reinforce bunkai and correct technique. If techniques in the &quot;kata&quot; are not performed correctly they will not be effective in two man training.

==Rule sets for the process of bunkai==

There are sets of rules which can be used to aid the correct analysis of kata for meaningful applications. Historically these were reputed to have been kept secret to prevent those without the rules from deciphering the meaning of the kata. The rule set used by Gōjū-ryū masters was known as Kaisai no genri. Similar but expanded and clarified rule sets have become available which are generally applicable to other styles of karate kata.

==Historical contention==
It has been claimed by martial arts historian Nathan Johnson that the few original antique kata found in karate were actually intended for weapons combat or (in one example) for grappling, as opposed to ballistic strikes.

<text>The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; University of the Year is an annual award given to a British university or other higher education institution by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The current University of the Year for 2025 is the London School of Economics and Political Science.

The award is given as part of the annual &quot;Times and Sunday Times University Guide&quot; since the second supplement&#x27;s second edition in 1999. Though the guide contains a league table of UK universities compiled from various statistics, the award is not necessarily given to the university at the top (in fact, it only has been in 2007 and 2010). Instead, a university is chosen by a panel of experts based on all round academic excellence.

In addition to the winner, shortlisted universities are also named. A runners-up position was introduced in 2006.

From 2009 onwards, the &quot;University Guide&quot; took the year of its name from the following year (so the guide published in 2009 is known as 2010, the guide published in 2010 is known as 2011 etc.)

Although similar in name, this award has no connection to the &quot;University of the Year&quot; award given by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;.

<doc id="980151" wikidata="Q4743104" url="?curid=980151" title="American Association of University Professors">
<text>The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is an organization of professors and other academics in the United States. AAUP membership includes over 500 local campus chapters and 39 state organizations.

The AAUP&#x27;s stated mission is to advance academic freedom and shared governance, to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and to ensure higher education&#x27;s contribution to the common good. Founded in 1915 by Arthur O. Lovejoy and John Dewey, the AAUP has helped to shape American higher education by developing the standards and procedures that maintain quality in education and academic freedom in the country&#x27;s colleges and universities.

== History ==

=== Issues around academic freedom and tenure before the AAUP ===
In the 1890s and early 1900s, there were a number of attempts to dismiss college faculty members from their academic posts, including a failed attempt to dismiss Richard Ely at the University of Wisconsin in 1894. The following year Edward Bemis was dismissed from a post at the University of Chicago and George D. Herron from one at Grinnell College in 1899.

Perhaps most prominent of these incidents was the 1900 dismissal of eugenicist, economics professor, and sociologist Edward Alsworth Ross from Stanford University. Ross&#x27;s work criticizing the employment of Chinese laborers by the Southern Pacific Railroad, run by Stanford&#x27;s founder Leland Stanford, led Leland&#x27;s widow, Jane Stanford, to intervene and, over the objections of the president and the faculty, to succeed in getting Ross eventually dismissed. A number of faculty colleagues resigned in protest, including Arthur O. Lovejoy.

=== Foundation ===
In January 1915, the Association of University Professors was formed after a series of meetings held at the Chemists&#x27; Club in New York City. John Dewey would serve as President of the organization, with Lovejoy, who had by then moved on to Johns Hopkins, serving as Secretary.

In February 1915, the dismissals of two professors and two instructors at the University of Utah by President Joseph T. Kingsbury—and the subsequent resignations of 14 faculty members in protest—launched the AAUP&#x27;s first institutional academic freedom inquest. An earlier 1911 controversy at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, had involved some of these same professors.

In December 1915, the inaugural volume of the &quot;Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors&quot; was published, including the document now known as the &quot;1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure&quot;—the AAUP&#x27;s foundational statement on the rights and corresponding obligations of members of the academic profession.

=== Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure ===
As the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) details the history of their policy on academic freedom and tenure, the association maintains that there &quot;are still people who want to control what professors teach and write.&quot; The AAUP&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot; is the definitive articulation of the principles and practices and is widely accepted throughout the academic community. The association&#x27;s procedures ensuring academic due process remain the model for professional employment practices on campuses throughout the country.

At the time, the ideas of academic freedom at the time were not entirely well received, and even the &quot;New York Times&quot; criticized the declaration, but that today the statement remains &quot;almost as nearly inviolate as the U.S. Constitution.&quot;

The AAUP offers the original principles, including the 1940 interpretations of the statement and a 1970 interpretation, which codified evaluation of the principles since the time they were adopted. The statement is straightforward, based on three principles of academic freedom. Briefly summarized, the first principle states that teachers are entitled to &quot;full freedom in research and in publication of the results&quot; and that the issue of financial gains from research depends on the relationship with the institution. The second principle of academic freedom is that teachers should have the same freedom in the classroom. The third asserts that college and university professors are citizens and should be free to speak and write as citizens &quot;free from institutional censorship.&quot;

The 1970 interpretation believes that the statement is not a &quot;static code but a fundamental document to set a framework of norms to guide adaptations to changing times and circumstances.&quot; The commentary iterates key points of the 1940 interpretations. The statement does not discourage controversy but emphasizes professionalism, believing that professors should be careful &quot;not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject.&quot;

Based upon five principles, the statement on academic tenure is equally simple and to the point. The first principle maintains that the terms of appointment are to be stated in writing. The second details the conditions and length of time professors are given to attain tenure. The third notes that during the probationary period before attaining tenure, the teacher &quot;should have all the academic freedom that all other members of the faculty have.&quot; Detailing terms for appeal of the decision to deny tenure, the fourth point notes that both faculty and the institution&#x27;s governing board should judge whether tenure is to be granted or denied. The final point suggests that if the faculty member is not granted tenure appointment for reasons of financial restraint upon the university, the &quot;financial exigency should be demonstrably bona fide.&quot;

The interpretive statement also maintains that while professors have the rights of citizens, both scholars and educational officers &quot;should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances,&quot; noting that every effort should be made &quot;to indicate they are not speaking for the institution.&quot; The comments provide for further insights into the evaluation for tenure appointment and direct to the &quot;1968 Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure,&quot; which recommends policy based upon the 1940 statement and a later documents on standards for faculty dismissal.

=== Academic freedom and the Supreme Court ===
In &quot;Sweezy v. New Hampshire&quot; (1957), the Supreme Court of the United States acknowledged the essential role of academic freedom as a protected right under the First Amendment. This case set a precedent that significantly influenced university policies across the United States, affirming the importance of academic discourse and inquiry without governmental interference. However, &quot;at the time of the Sweezy decision, the AAUP was deeply ambivalent about the constitutionalization of academic freedom, because some members feared the long-term consequences of having judges rather than professors elaborate and apply the protective rules of academic life.&quot;

In &quot;Keyishian v. Board of Regents&quot; (1967), the constitutionality and legal basis for AAUP&#x27;s principles of academic freedom were established.

=== Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities ===
The American Association of University Professors published its first &quot;Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities&quot; in 1920, &quot;emphasizing the importance of faculty involvement in personnel decisions, selection of administrators, preparation of the budget, and determination of educational policies. Refinements to the statement were introduced in subsequent years, culminating in the 1966 &quot;Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities.&quot;

The statement was jointly formulated by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB). The statement clarifies the respective roles of governing boards, faculties, and administrations. The document does not provide for a &quot;blueprint&quot; to the governance of higher education.

Also, the purpose of the statement was not to provide principles for relations with industry and government although it establishes direction on &quot;the correction of existing weaknesses.&quot; Rather, the statement aimed to establish a shared vision for the internal governance of institutions. Student involvement is not addressed in detail. The statement concerns general education policy and internal operations with an overview of the formal roles for governing structures in the organization and management of higher education.

=== Recent events ===
Since 2010, the AAUP has published the &quot;Journal of Academic Freedom&quot;, an online-only open-access annual journal.

In June 2022, the AAUP affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers.

In 2024, AAUP president Todd Wolfson referred to United States Senator JD Vance as a &quot;fascist,&quot; during that year&#x27;s presidential election.

== Conflict with religious institutions ==
The AAUP has censured numerous religious institutions, including The Catholic University of America in 1990 and Brigham Young University in 1998. Some have criticized the AAUP&#x27;s stance regarding academic freedom in religious institutions as contradicting its 1940 statement on academic freedom, which permits religious institutions to place limits on academic freedom if those limitations are clearly stated. In 1970, the AAUP criticized its 1940 statement, positing that most religious institutions &quot;no longer need or desire&quot; to place limits on academic freedom.

In 1988, the AAUP offered up another interpretation, stating that the &quot;1970 de-endorsement clause&quot; requires a religious institution to forfeit its &quot;right to represent itself as an &#x27;authentic seat of higher learning.&#x27;&quot; But the AAUP&#x27;s Committee A did not endorse it, thus the issue on whether a religious institution can place limits on academic freedom if those limitations are clearly stated appears to be unresolved.

== Censured and sanctioned institutions ==
The AAUP censures institutions that violated standards of academic freedom and tenure and sanctions institutions that have infringed university governance standards through &quot;serious departures by the administration and/or governing board from generally accepted standards of college and university government&quot;.

In 1930, the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University and Mississippi University for Women, were placed on a list of &quot;non-recommended&quot; institutions, after Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo and member of the Ku Klux Klan fired the presidents of all three institutions as well as 179 faculty members.

The censure list was officially created in 1938. Between that year and 2002, 183 colleges and universities were placed on the list at various times. As of 2024, there are 59 institutions on AAUP&#x27;s censure list.

Fourteen colleges in the United States are currently on AAUP&#x27;s list of sanctioned institutions for violations of shared governance. 
== Collective bargaining ==

In 2009, AAUP began its reorganization amongst its thinktank, its non-organized advocacy chapters and its support for collective bargaining chapters. AAUP currently represents approximately 70 affiliates across the United States in such institutions as University of Connecticut, Portland State University, University of Alaska, the California State University system, Rutgers, University of Oregon, Eastern Michigan University, University of Illinois Chicago, University of Rhode Island, State University of New York, and many others in both the public and private sector.

Unlike the American Federation of Teachers and other more traditional labor unions, AAUP is not a servicing parent organization. All of its affiliates (at least those that are not affiliated with any other labor union) are independent organizations that completely provide for all their own services, such as staff, attorneys, consultants and organizers. Also, the AAUP does not have the power of receivership in its constitution and so it can not take over any of its affiliates, supplant any of its elected leaders, or dictate policy or bargaining proposals or agenda upon them.

Several university chapters have been involved in labor strikes, including at Boston University in 1979, Wright State University and Oregon Tech in 2021, and Rutgers University in 2023.

== Contingent faculty ==

The AAUP has released a number of reports on contingent faculty: in 2008, a report on accreditors&#x27; guidelines pertaining to part-time faculty and a report of an investigation involving alleged violations of the academic freedom and due process rights of a full-time contingent faculty member; and in 2006, an index providing data on the number of contingent faculty at various colleges. Also in 2006, the AAUP adopted a new policy dealing with the job protections that should be afforded to part-time faculty members. In 2003, it had released its major policy statement Contingent Appointments and the Academic Profession. The statement makes new recommendations in two areas: increasing the proportion of faculty appointments that are on the tenure line as well as improving job security and due process protections for those with contingent appointments.

== Leadership ==

=== Presidents ===
=== Secretaries, general secretaries, and executive directors ===
Apart from the elected leadership, the AAUP has been led in its day to day operations by what has been at various times called a secretary, later a general secretary, and most recently an executive director, and includes the following individuals:

<text>Tyrrellspass (, IPA:[ˈbʲaləxˈanˠˈtʲɪɾʲiəliː]) is a Georgian village in County Westmeath, Ireland. It is from Dublin, in the south of the county on the R446 (formerly the N6) road. Tyrrellspass won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1969. As of the census in April 2016, the population of Tyrrellspass was 483.

==History==
The origins of the village settlement lie in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594-1603), also called Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion. In 1597 there was a battle in Tyrrellspass and the Irish, between 300 and 400 strong and led by Richard Tyrrell, attacked and defeated the English army. Out of 1,000 English troops only one survived.
There is a historic castle on the edge of the town. It is the only remaining castle of the Tyrrells, who came to Ireland around the time of the Norman invasion.

The current core of the village is a planned estate village dating from the late 18th century, and was influenced by the English style of planned villages.

The village has a distinctive green and crescent of houses, including the Church of Ireland church and what was previously the court house, which was redeveloped c. 1820 under the patronage of Jane MacKey, Countess of Belvedere (d. 1836). The Catholic church, the Church of St. Stephen, is located across from Tyrrellspass Castle. The Church of Ireland church is St. Sinian&#x27;s.

The Belvedere Protestant Children&#x27;s Orphanage operated in Tyrellspass from 1842 until 1943.

During the 1916 Easter Rising, some rebels barricaded a house in Meedin, Tyrrellspass, with the intention of waiting for reinforcements and then attacking surrounding police barracks. Local legend has it that Michael Collins stayed in this house, the home of the Malones, who still occupy it. The RIC attempted to capture the house three times. Twice they were repelled with gunfire, before they eventually succeeded on the Wednesday after Easter week, and arrested the two remaining rebels, Thomas and Joseph Malone. They were the last two men captured under arms during the Rising.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic football team, Tyrrellspass GAA, team won the Westmeath Senior Football Championship in 1999, 2006 and defended their title in 2007. In the 2007 Leinster Club Football Championship they progressed as far as the final, where they were beaten by the eventual All Ireland Club champions St. Vincents of Dublin.

The village also has a golf course, New Forest Golf Resort, which is located a mile outside the village. It is designed by golf course designer Peter McEvoy.

<text>Twining Models of Northampton, England, was founded in 1920 by Ernest W. Twining. The firm had its origins in work Twining was doing as a sub-contractor to Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s. It undertook, mostly for Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s, (though never a formal part of that company), the manufacture of high quality glass-case models, which were often marketed under Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s name. Twining sold out in 1940, and the firm was run until 1967 as Twining Models (E. H. Clifton) Ltd.. E. H. Clifton had been a director of Twining Models, having started working for Twining as a school-leaver before Twining Models was first established.

Throughout its forty-seven-year history, Twining Models established a reputation as one of the foremost British model makers. It specialised in architectural, industrial, and transport models. Before WW2 it made a number of models for the Queen Mary&#x27;s Dolls&#x27; House, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and now at Windsor Castle, stained-glass work (on which Twining was an expert) and astronomical telescopes. After WW2 the firm made a number of planning models used in the re-development of bomb-damaged cities, also various kinds of power stations and industrial developments. The firm was never large, usually employing only a handful of craftsmen. In all some 400 models were made by the firm during its existence.

<text>Mark Bell (22 February 1971 – 8 October 2014) was a British DJ, record producer, and member of the pioneering techno group LFO. He recorded on Warp Records, and also collaborated with artists such as Björk and Depeche Mode.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mark Bell&#x27;s early musical influences came from three specific sources. One was an art teacher in school who taught art and played music by Jean-Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk, an older sister who played disco, funk music and electro from her bedroom, and a music shop in Leeds Mark described as having &quot;arcade games like &quot;Tempest&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;&quot; and that it would play &quot;loads of early hip hop like Schoolly D. I remember feeling this is mine and my friend’s place&quot;. Bell&#x27;s first experiments in electronic music involved him making a deal with his girlfriend&#x27;s father who made his musical ballads listened to despite disliking them. Bell convinced him he required a real backing band and purchased his drum machine from him.

Bell went to college to study photography and graphic design, where he met the West Yorkshire DJ Martin Williams and Gez Varley. With money from Varley&#x27;s grandmother, Bell had access to a bedroom full of equipment. In 1988, Varley, Bell and Martin began to play gigs as LFO, named after the low frequency oscillator, a function of many synthesizers.

===LFO===
LFO were performing at the Warehouse, a club in Leeds, when Steve Beckett and Rob Mitchell arrived and noticed the positive reception club goers had to the track &quot;LFO&quot;. Beckett and Mitchell were the original creators of the Warp record label, but had not officially created the label yet. Despite this, Beckett and Mitchell offered to put out a 12-inch single, which was expected to sell about 2,000 copies but eventually became a Top 20 hit. The label released their first studio album &quot;Frequencies&quot; in 1991. Following the album&#x27;s release, Bell continued to release singles for other independent labels such as Carl Craig&#x27;s Planet E. 

While working on a follow-up album, Bell began his partnership with Björk before the release of her album &quot;Post&quot;. Bell gave her a cassette of LFO demo material allowing her to use what she wanted for a future release. Björk chose a track that would later become her song &quot;I Go Humble&quot;, which would show up again in instrumental form as &quot;Shove Piggy Shove&quot; on the LFO album &quot;Advance&quot; in 1996. When asked about the long gap between records, Bell stated “It’s not intentional...It&#x27;s easy doing your first album as you have all the first part of your life to express. The second one is harder unless you&#x27;re going to repeat yourself... and repetition bores me a bit, it&#x27;s a complete wasted opportunity to be creative.&quot; After the release of &quot;Advance&quot;, Bell and Varley parted ways, with Bell retaining rights to the name LFO. Bell continued to perform under the LFO moniker.

Bell released one more LFO album, &quot;Sheath&quot; in 2003.

===Production work===

Bell worked on almost every Björk album until &quot;Biophilia&quot; in 2011.

Björk had initially wanted Bell to contribute to her albums &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;, however, he started a real collaboration with her on the album &quot;Homogenic&quot;. Bell was credited for the majority of the album&#x27;s production, including the songs &quot;Pluto&quot;, &quot;Alarm Call&quot;, and the bassline in &quot;Jóga&quot;. Björk stated that she &quot;trusts and respects what [Bell] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell&quot;.

Bell would also produce Björk&#x27;s &quot;Selmasongs&quot;, the soundtrack to the Lars von Trier&#x27;s film &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;.

Bell also produced Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Exciter&quot;. Bell commented that he found working with the group fun but strange, stating he had listened to the group when he was 12 and found the band asking him for days off or for &quot;what they should eat&quot;.

===Other collaborations===
Other collaborations included contributing to Deltron 3030&#x27;s self-titled album.

===Death===
Bell died on 8 October 2014 at the age of 43. His death was reported on 13 October 2014 due to complications after surgery.

<text>Kilbeggan () is a town in County Westmeath, Ireland. It is in the barony of Moycashel.

==Geography==
Kilbeggan is situated on the River Brosna, in the south of County Westmeath. It lies south of Lough Ennell, and Castletown Geoghegan, north of the boundary with County Offaly, about 9 kilometres north of Tullamore. Kilbeggan is surrounded by the gently rolling Esker Riada, the linear sand hills that stretch across the Irish midlands, which were left by retreating glaciers at the end of the last ice age. It is famous as the location of the oldest recorded incidence of a tornado in Europe.

Kilbeggan comprises 29 townlands: Aghamore, Aghuldred, Ardnaglew, Ballinderry Big, Ballinderry Little, Ballinwire, Ballymacmorris, Ballynasudder, Ballyoban, Brownscurragh, Camagh, Clonaglin, Coola, Demesne or Mearsparkfarm, Grange and Kiltober, Grangegibbon, Greenan, Guigginstown, Hallsfarm, Kilbeggan, Kilbeggan North, Kilbeggan South, Kiltober / Kiltubber and Grange, Loughanagore, Meadowpark, Meeldrum, Meeniska, Meersparkfarm or Demesne, Shureen and Ballynasuddery, Skeahanagh, Stonehousefarmand Tonaphort.

The neighbouring civil parishes are: Castletown Kindalen to the north, Newtown to the east, Rahugh to the east and south, Durrow to the south and Ardnurcher or Horseleap to the west.

==Transport==

The N6 - the main route between Dublin and Galway - originally passed through Kilbeggan, meeting the N52 in the town centre. Both the N6 and N52 have been re-routed to bypass the town to the south, with the road through the centre now reclassified as the R446 regional road.
Kilbeggan being situated on the main Dublin-Galway route means it has public transport options to these main cities. A townlink service also connects the main surrounding towns such as Mullingar and Tullamore. It is the first Westmeath town that Kearns transport stops in en route to Dublin.

==History==

St Bécán, one of the &#x27;Twelve Apostles of Ireland&#x27;, founded a monastery here in the 6th century, giving rise to the town&#x27;s Irish name , meaning &quot;the church of St Bécán&quot;. In time the monastery fell into disuse and disrepair. A new monastery was founded on the site in 1150, by a member of the Mac Loghlan family, the ruins of the previous one having been rebuilt by the Dalton family. It was subsequently home to Cistercian monks from Mellifont Abbey. The great priest of Clonmacnois, O&#x27;Catharnaigh (O&#x27;Kearney), died at the monastery in 1196 and Hugh O&#x27;Malone, Bishop of Clonmacnois, was buried there in 1236. In 1217 the monastery was involved in the riot of Jerpoint, and the abbot was punished as a result. Following the Conspiracy of Mellifont, the monastery was made subject to Buildwas Abbey. After its dissolution in 1539, the monastery and its extensive lands were granted to the Lambart family. The monastery was subsequently totally demolished and its location was lost. However, the location and full plan of the monastery were uncovered by geophysical survey by Archaeological Projects in 2003 west of the early-medieval graveyard (Hayden 2003). A later parish church was built northeast of the early medieval church and served as the parish church for the reformed Church of Ireland. The church is no longer in use. The tower survives, in a ruinous state.

A ford crossing the River Brosna at Kilbeggan was the site, in 972, of a battle between the Danes and the Irish. A skirmish led by the United Irishmen took place in the town, as part of the Irish Rebellion of 1798

The Lambart family came to be politically dominant in the midlands. They firmly established themselves in and around Kilbeggan, gradually 
replacing the Geoghegan Family who were the leaders of Moycashel and the formidable Irish of (West) Meath Alliance who kept the English of (East) Meath in check from the Norman Invasion through the War of the Three Kingdoms, during which they sat as members for the two county Westmeath boroughs, 
and after The Restoration were restored to some land up to the ultimate defeat of the Irish by William and Mary&#x27;s forces and allies and the Treaty of Limerick.

Sir Oliver Lambart was made Governor of Connaught in 1601 upon the completion of the Tudor Conquest and the last great battle for a Gaelic Ireland at Kinsale, where Bryan Geoghegan and his small band was the great holdout at Dunboy. At payback time Lambart was charged with curbing the intransigent Geoghegans and their allies and was subsequently granted plan for a model Tudor of land and 60 houses. Lambart inaugurated a weekly market in the town in 1606. Kilbeggan became a borough town by charter of James I in 1612. Kilbeggan&#x27;s market became important to the surrounding agricultural community. The substantial market house still stands in the town, though no longer used for its original purpose.

Kilbeggan Distillery, standing on the banks of the River Brosna, commenced whiskey production in 1757. Within the distillery complex, the owner constructed a house and gardens on an island in the river. A member of the Locke family established the Convent of Mercy in the town in 1879.

A branch of the Grand Canal, between Dublin and the River Shannon, served the town, opening in 1835. The inhabitants of Kilbeggan have been attempting to have the Kilbeggan branch of the Grand canal restored at the junction of Murphy&#x27;s bridge to Kilbeggan harbour.

Rostella (Rosdalla), 3 km south of Kilbeggan is the site of the earliest recorded tornado in Europe, which occurred on 30 April 1054.

==Amenities==

The town serves as a service centre for the local farming community; hosts some light industry, including sand and gravel extraction in the surrounding area. It is increasingly seen as a Dublin commuter town, particularly since the improvement of the N6/M6 and the extension of the M4 motorway west of the city.

The canal branch closed in the 1960s and the basin is now dry. The harbour buildings, however, have survived and are now in use as offices and workspace.

Although whiskey production ended at Locke&#x27;s Distillery in the 1950s, the buildings survived and were reopened as a visitor attraction. Distillation has recently recommenced.

Kilbeggan Racecourse is around 1 kilometre north of the town. It is Ireland&#x27;s only all-National Hunt course.

Kilbeggan is home to Mercy Secondary School, which stands on the Dublin Road. It is linked to the Mercy Convent, situated in the town.

Durrow Abbey is located around 4 kilometres south of the town, just across the county boundary with Offaly.

Kilbeggan is home to a significant Brazilian diaspora community, and possesses a shop offering ethnic Brazilian goods and money transfer services.

==Events==

The &#x27;Kilbeggan Knighthood Festival&#x27; takes place during the first weekend in June and commemorates the knighting of Thomas Cuffe, a local innkeeper that was knighted by Lord Townshend after a night of drinking in 1772. During this weekend, various activities take place such as parades, a market in the square and reenactment events.

<text>An air vortex cannon is a toy that releases doughnut-shaped air vortices — similar to smoke rings but larger, stronger and invisible. The vortices can ruffle hair, disturb papers or blow out candles after travelling several metres.

An air vortex cannon can be made easily at home, from just a cardboard box.
Air cannons are used in some amusement parks such as Universal Studios to spook or surprise visitors.

The Wham-O Air Blaster toy introduced in 1965 could blow out a candle at . The commercial Airzooka was developed by Brian S. Jordan who claims to have conceived it when still a boy. A feature of the Airzooka is a loose non-elastic polythene membrane, tensioned by a bungee cord, rather than elastic membranes. This allows a much greater volume of air to be displaced.

A large air vortex cannon, with a wide barrel and a displacement volume of was built in March 2008 at the University of Minnesota, and could blow out candles at .

In 2012, a large air vortex cannon was built for Czech Television program &quot;Zázraky přírody&quot; (). It was capable of bringing down a wall of cardboard boxes from in what was claimed to be a world record.

<text>&quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot;: Further Adventures of a Curious Character is an edited collections of reminiscences by the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. Released in 1988, the book covers several instances in Feynman&#x27;s life and was prepared from recorded audio conversations that he had with Ralph Leighton, his close friend and drumming partner. It follows the same format established in &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;, published in 1985.

==Overview==
The book was prepared as Feynman struggled with liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer from which he died in February 1988. The book is the last of his autobiographical works.

The first section presents a series of humorous stories from different periods of his life, while the second chronicles his involvement on the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In one chapter, he describes an impromptu experiment in which he showed how the O-rings in the shuttle&#x27;s rocket boosters could have failed due to cold temperatures on the morning of the launch. Later, this failure was determined to be the primary cause of the shuttle&#x27;s destruction. Feynman&#x27;s comments on the reliability of the shuttle, published as an appendix to the Rogers Commission&#x27;s final report, are included. The second section of the book was dramatized in a television movie by BBC/Science Channel titled &quot;The Challenger Disaster&quot;.

The book is much more loosely organized than the earlier &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; It contains short stories, letters, photographs, and a few of the sketches that Feynman created in later life when he had learned to draw from an artist friend, Jirayr Zorthian.

The titular story of the book focuses on Feynman&#x27;s first wife, Arline, who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis before their marriage. Its title is taken from a question she often put to him when he seemed preoccupied with the opinions of his colleagues about his work, thereby echoing his own earlier words to her. She died while Feynman was working on the Manhattan Project. 

The book concludes with a chapter titled &quot;The Value of Science&quot;, an address Feynman gave at the 1955 autumn meeting of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; said &quot;The book makes excellent reading both for its entertaining style and for Feynman&#x27;s keen insights&quot;.

<doc id="980176" wikidata="Q2084537" url="?curid=980176" title="Rochfortbridge">
<text>Rochfortbridge () is a village in County Westmeath, Ireland. The village is located at the intersection of the R400 and the R446 (formerly the N6) roads. As of the 2016 census, the population of Rochfortbridge was 1,473.

==History==
Rochfortbridge is spread between the townlands of Castlelost and Rahanine, both within Castlelost parish, which was inhabited at least as early as 590 AD by monks under Mo Chutu (later St. Carthage). The village was originally known as Beggar&#x27;s Bridge, supposedly after a beggar who died at a river crossing; enough money was found in his pockets to build a bridge.

The village proper was set out  1700 by Robert Rochfort, MP for Westmeath from 1651 to 1727. As part of the village building programme, Rochfort financed and built a new bridge over the River Derry, giving the village its new name. Following the death of Rochfort in 1727, the village was controlled by his son George Rochfort. George died just three years later, in 1730, and the village was then under the control of his son Robert Rochfort (soon to become 1st Earl of Belvedere). On the death of the 1st Earl, the village passed to his son and heir George Augustus Rochfort, the 2nd Earl of Belvedere.

In 1797 Lt. Col. Robert Rochfort, son of the 1st Earl and brother of the 2nd Earl, died; his estate passed to the Cooper family. The other great Rochfort estate at Gaulstown passed to Lord Kilmaine. In 1847 Josias Cooper and Lord Kilmaine rebuilt the village as part of a famine relief programme. Almost all of the original village dwellings were demolished during this rebuilding effort; the only remaining Rochefort-era building is the former Church of Ireland.

===Mercy Convent and St. Joseph&#x27;s===
In 1862 three nuns established Mercy Convent Rochfortbridge, moving into a purpose-built building in 1872 with the monetary support of a local family. At the urging of Thomas McNulty, Bishop of Meath, Mother Mary Stanislaus O&#x27;Neill established St. Joseph&#x27;s Institute for the Deaf and Dumb in 1892, which provided education and vocational training for deaf and dumb girls until its closure in 1942 due to low attendance. In 1948 St. Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School opened, expanding to admit boys as well as girls in 1963.

In September 2016, it was announced the Convent of Mercy was to be retired, with the final three nuns in Rochfortbridge officially retiring on 16 September 2016 following a celebration of thanksgiving.

===Historic sites===

Other historic sites in the village area include Castlelost Castle, moat, and graveyard. There is also an example of a ring fort in the middle of the village.

The Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception dates back to 1857.

The Church of Ireland church, Castlelost Parish Church, dates to 1815.

==Amenities and development==
The village has one primary school and one secondary school; the boys primary school (formally called schoil bhride) amalgamated with the neighbouring girls school in 2014. There are two more primary schools in the wider area.

Rochfortbridge was bypassed in 2006 by the new M6 motorway, which superseded the N6 national primary road running through the centre of the village.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 census there were 1,494 people in Rochfortbridge: 743 males and 751 females. Rochfortbridge has been established as a commuter location, moving away from its historically agricultural background. At the time of the census 346 workers were employed outside of the area, out of 479 workers total, while only six were employed in agricultural, forestry, or fishing industries.

Non-Irish nationals accounted for only 6.4% of the population, with the two largest sub-groups being UK nationals (26 persons) and Nigerians (15 persons). The dominant religion was Catholicism, with 1,356 adherents; 92 people stated they were of other religions, with 38 claiming to be of no religion. Unemployment was higher in the Rochfortbridge area than nationally, at 27.1% compared to 19.0%.

<doc id="980182" wikidata="Q2722475" url="?curid=980182" title="Gary Driscoll">
<text>John Gary Driscoll (April 18, 1946 – June 8, 1987) was an American R&amp;B-style rock drummer who performed in a number of successful bands from the 1960s until his unsolved murder.

==Music career==
He first entered the music scene when he joined Ronnie Dio and the Prophets in June 1965, fronted by Ronnie James Dio. The band transformed into the Electric Elves, the Elves, and finally Elf in 1969, releasing a few singles along the way. They were eventually discovered by Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover who went on to produce all three of Elf&#x27;s studio albums.

Elf disbanded in 1975 when Gary Driscoll, Ronnie James Dio, Micky Lee Soule (Elf&#x27;s keyboardist), and Craig Gruber (their bassist) were recruited by Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore to form the rock band Rainbow.

Driscoll was dismissed from Rainbow shortly after their debut album, entitled &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, was recorded. It is speculated that firing Gary was simply due to his R&amp;B style of drumming, which did not sit well with Blackmore. Driscoll was later replaced with British hard rocker, Cozy Powell. 

Although he was dismissed from Rainbow, Blackmore later remembered the drummer fondly but said he was very clumsy in the studio and live with Elf.

After his departure from Rainbow, Driscoll played in the band Dakota (1978–1980, from Scranton, formerly the Jerry Kelly Band), before starting Bible Black with Craig Gruber, future Blue Cheer guitarist Duck MacDonald and singer Jeff Fenholt. This band released their self-titled album as well as the albums &quot;Ground Zero&quot; and, with a few other musicians, &quot;Burning at the Speed of Light&quot;, none of which sold well. Driscoll found a day job in tile installation, and made a little extra money on the side as a session musician.

==Murder==
Driscoll was murdered in Ithaca, New York, on June 8, 1987. He had a residence nine miles away in Newfield. Driscoll often visited his friend Robert Gelinas in Ithaca, and it was in the basement of this building that Driscoll was found dead, severely beaten and stabbed, with two gunshots to the head. Gelinas sold drugs out of his apartment, and had recently resorted to sleeping in a motel with his girlfriend Lynette Tome in order to hide from persistent customers disturbing him late at night, especially John Shillingford who had argued angrily with Gelinas over a cocaine sale. Shillingford carried a 32-caliber handgun which he stated was for defense against Charles Harvey who was an associate of Gelinas in the drug trade. 

Driscoll stopped by the apartment on June 7 as Gelinas and Tome were leaving for the night, and they said he could stay if he wanted to. Shillingford apparently entered the building and beat Driscoll late that night or early the next morning, cut him with a knife, and fired his gun twice at Driscoll&#x27;s head. The gun was discarded nearby, recovered by police. Shillingford&#x27;s fingerprints were identified on Driscoll&#x27;s car found abandoned a few miles north at Cayuga Shopping Center. Shillingford was acquitted after his attorney successfully challenged the handgun evidence. The handgun had been found on a roadway with a broken grip, and pieces of the grip were also found in a grassy field. Defense alleged that police investigators had planted evidence at the crime scene, involving pieces of the gun grip reportedly found days later on the carpet of the apartment, which had already been searched thoroughly.

<text>Humorous Interpretation (often shortened to &quot;HI&quot;, or &quot;Humor&quot;) is an event in competitive middle and high school forensics leagues such as the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association and the National Speech and Debate Association. It consists of a piece from any published work, edited to fit within a 10-minute span with a 30-second grace period (it does not have a minimum and cannot be above 10:30). It is judged based upon how the person portrays his or her characters and whether the piece is humorous. Ideally proper portrayal of characters should achieve a comedic effect to the judge. Humorous Interpretation and Dramatic Interpretation pieces are often used for the National Catholic Forensic League category of Dramatic Performance, which has similar rules but allows for a wider variety of pieces.

== Rules ==
While rules vary by state, a piece must be published, cannot exceed ten minutes, and must be of a humorous nature. Performance must include an introduction that states the title of the selection and the author. The introduction is an original work that should remain very brief. A teaser may precede the introduction. However, there may not be any more than 100 added words throughout the piece, including the introduction. 

In addition to the introduction being original, competitors may also incorporate verbal transitions, so long as they do not exceed 100 words or change the intent of the author. Other than for transitional and introductory purposes, though, no original words may be added to the piece. Gratuitous vulgarity refers to any unnecessary vulgar actions. Gratuitous vulgarity is not permitted and may result in being marked down. Singing and dancing is allowed in Humorous Interpretation, but it must be motivated by the text and easily justifiable. 

Props and costumes are not permitted. Humorous Interpretation must also remain a solo performance. No partners are permitted. Finally, the speech that a competitor is using for Humorous Interpretation, he or she may not use in any other event he or she is entered in.

== Choosing a piece ==
When choosing a piece, competitors may use any form of published material - whether it be a dictionary, movie script or a novel. Pieces that tend to be more popular, though, are movie scripts, novels and plays. Picking a piece that can be cut down to ten minutes can be very difficult, but it is important that when choosing a piece, performers keep in mind how they might go about cutting it down. In addition, it is very important that performers pick out pieces that are not commonly done. According to Darren C. Goins, picking a &quot;fresh&quot; piece is one of the best ways to ensure a successful season. One very good source student can turn to in order to find good pieces is winning pieces of play writing contests and such.

== Humorous Interpretation in Performance ==
Pieces must be memorized in Humorous Interpretation. No scripts are allowed. The number of characters that can be present in the piece is entirely dependent upon the competitor&#x27;s level of ability. It may range anywhere from one character to multiple characters. Each different character is distinguished by a different posture and character voice. Throughout the piece, competitors switch back and forth between characters with character pops. 

Pops are a quick transition between characters where the performer quickly re-adjusts his or her body to the appropriate character. There are different styles and ways of popping in and out of characters. A different style of pops is one that is more of a slide into the other character, it is much less abrupt. Regardless of how one decides to go about alternating between characters, though, the one thing performers must make sure of is that it is very clear they are portraying a different character. This doesn&#x27;t have to be done with just posture alone, a competitor may also utilize different voices to differentiate between characters. 

The voices that represent each character should be vastly different and distinct. Because competitors are not allowed to use props or costumes, they must pantomime a prop when necessary. When performing, competitors are expected to dress in business attire and be professional. Humorous Interpretation rounds will often have anywhere between five and seven competitors. The rounds are ranked first to last, the smallest number being the best.

<text>is a Japanese youth subculture associated with customized motorcycles. The first appearance of these types of biker gangs was in the 1950s. Popularity climbed throughout the 1980s, peaking at an estimated 42,510 members in 1982. Their numbers dropped dramatically in the 2000s, with fewer than 7,297 members in 2012. Later, in 2020, a rally that used to attract thousands of members only had 53 members, with police stating that it was a long time since they had to round up that many people. 

 style traditionally involves boilersuits similar to those of manual laborers or leather military jackets with baggy pants, and tall boots. This uniform became known as the and is often adorned with kanji slogans. Typical accessories to this uniform are , surgical masks, and patches displaying the Rising Sun Flag. members are known for taking Japanese road bikes and adding modifications such as over-sized fairings, lifted handle bars shifted inwards, large seat backs, extravagant paint jobs, and modified mufflers. styles take inspiration from choppers, greasers, and Teddy boys.

== History ==

 first started as groups of returning World War II veterans. The disobedient subculture originated in the 1950s when the young pilots came back from World War II. Many veterans faced difficulty readjusting to society after the war, and some turned to custom car making and gang-like activities on city streets to gain an adrenaline fix. These early took inspiration from American greaser culture and imported Western films; became known for its many similarities to old American biker culture. Many younger individuals began to see this style of life as very appealing, especially marginalized individuals looking for change. Eventually, these youngsters took over the identity, becoming the foundation for the modern .

The 1970s were when the term of first truly began to emerge. This was a period of time characterized by actual riots between police and many of these youth groups. The term was not actually created by these biker groups, but was eventually widely adopted and used by these various groups. In the 1980s and 1990s, would often embark on massed rides, in which up to 100 bikers would cruise together slowly en masse down an expressway or major highway. The motorcyclists would run toll booths without stopping and would ignore police attempts to detain them. New Year&#x27;s Eve was a popular occasion for the massed rides. The bikers would sometimes smash the cars and threaten or beat up any motorists or bystanders who got in the way or expressed disapproval of the bikers&#x27; behavior. Participation in the gangs peaked at 42,510 members in 1982. This made the prevailing form of youth delinquency within Japan.

Numbers slowly began to decline following the 1980s peak. It is reported that, by the 1990s there were around 28,000 sprinkled throughout the country. In 2004, the Japanese government passed a revised road traffic law which gave the police more power to arrest bikers riding recklessly in groups. With increased arrests and prosecutions, participation rapidly went into decline. As of 2010, police reported that the new trend among was to ride together in much smaller groups and to ride scooters instead of heavily modified motorcycles. Aichi prefecture was reported to have the highest number of riders, followed by Tokyo, Osaka, Ibaraki and Fukuoka. By 2015, there were only a reported 6,771 active throughout Japan. In 2013, the National Police Agency re-classified biker gangs as &quot;pseudo-yakuza&quot; organizations.

== Traits ==

 are usually between the ages of 16 and 20 years old. They are known for their style that heavily mimics greaser culture within the United States. This includes a pompadour style haircut, uniforms, which were often modified and embroidered jumpsuits, inspired by those worn by manual laborers during the WWII era, baggy pants and military boots. were often embroidered with various slogans and large, intricate designs. They were seen as a status symbol to many, symbolizing both their pride in themselves and their strength. They were often worn open in the front, with bandage wrappings around their waist. They would also often be accompanied by rounded sunglasses and tasuki.

The word is also applied to motorcycle subculture with an interest in motorcycle customizing, often illegal, and making noise by removing the mufflers on their vehicles so that more noise is produced. These groups sometimes ride without motorcycle helmets (which in Japan is illegal), also engage in dangerous or reckless driving, such as weaving in traffic, and running red lights. Another activity is speeding in city streets, not usually for street racing but more for thrills. With many bikes involved, the leading one is driven by the leader, who is responsible for the event and is not allowed to be overtaken. Japanese police call them (police code or ) and occasionally dispatch police vehicles to trail the groups of bikes for the reason of preventing possible incidents, which may include: riding very slowly through suburbs at speeds of , creating a loud disturbance while waving imperial Japanese flags, and starting fights that may include weapons (such as wooden swords, metal pipes, baseball bats, and Molotov cocktails).

==Vehicles==

 are known to modify their motorcycles in peculiar and showy ways, which are called . The general style of bike modification appears to combine elements of an American chopper bike and a British café racer. Examples of modifications that are taken from these styles are raised handle bars like those on a chopper or over-sized fairings like those found on café racers (though usually fit them much higher on the bike than their original position, and angled upwards at the front).

A typical customized bike starts off by taking an average 250-400cc Japanese road bike, adding a exhaust system (multiple tube header), squeezing the handlebars inwards (known as , from the verb , &quot;to squeeze&quot;), and adding a three- or four-trumpet horn - or , respectively.

Loud paint schemes on the fenders or the gas tanks with motifs such as flames or kamikaze-style &quot;rising sun&quot; designs are also quite common. The bikes will often be adorned with stickers and/or flags depicting the gang&#x27;s symbol or logo.

There are also marked regional differences in motorcycle modifications. For example, Ibaraki are known to modify their motorcycles in an extensively colorful, flashy way. They will often have three or four oversized fairings in a tower-like way in and an abundance of lights.

In America, the term &quot;Bosozoku&quot; is also applied to cars that have undergone extreme modification. The term generally only applies to Japanese manufactured vehicles, and is somewhat interchangeable with the term &quot;Kaido Racer&quot;. Broadly, &quot;Bosozoku&quot; refers to the concept of Japanese vehicle modification, whereas &quot;Kaido Racer&quot; refers specifically to car modification.

== Ties to organized crime ==
In general, the Japanese government sees as highly organized groups, affiliated under several national federations. They generally have clear cut rules, uniforms, symbols, and other marks of organization. Some groups have membership fees and set punishments. These groups also make up a large proportion of Japanese criminal activity, being involved in vandalism, road traffic violations, and other criminal activity.

Their lives of crime generally do not end after they turn twenty though. It is estimated that around 25% of are above the age of twenty. Alongside that, they have been shown to have ties to various yakuza organizations. In fact, some numbers predict that as many as one-third of yakuza recruits come from one of a few . However, as these groups become less common, their ties to the yakuza become less apparent, as they begin recruiting from other marginalized groups, such as the Japanese or Zainichi ethnic Koreans.

<text>The East Kent Railway (EKR) is a heritage railway in Kent, England. It is located at Shepherdswell station on the London and Chatham to Dover mainline. The line was constructed between 1911 and 1917 to serve the Kent Coalfields. See East Kent Light Railway for details of the original lines. The Kent Collieries were mostly a failure with only Tilmanstone on the line producing any viable commercial coal and commercial traffic over the line.
The line is operated by heritage diesel locomotives. It is home to a collection of heritage diesel locomotives including a British Rail Class 08, DEMU and electric multiple units including an in service British Rail Class 404 built in the 1930s and a more modern British Rail Class 365, which is to be used as a restaurant and a major events venue.

At Shepherdswell, there is a large cafe, a large woodland area with walking routes, a gauge miniature railway, a gauge woodland miniature railway, a model railway and a small museum. Shepherdswell is where the railway undertakes it maintenance and overhaul works and is very much a working railway yard.

At Eythorne, there is a Class 365 EMU that has been converted to a restaurant and bar. There is a General Utility Van built by BR that used to carry elephants which is in the process of being converted to a small holiday let. The old Selling Signal Box is also here with a history of the East Kent Railway both past and present inside along with the original Faversham signalling panel. Eythorne Station plays host to a variety of features on special event days. Eythorne is the picture of a pretty countryside station.

The railway holds special events throughout the year, ranging from railway enthusiast events to beer festivals along with family fun weekends.

On the line there is Golgotha Tunnel (situated between Shepherdswell and Eythorne), long, making it the eighth longest tunnel on a UK Heritage Railway in Preservation. The tunnel was built in typical Colonel Stephens style by building double track portals but only excavating a single track internally to save money.

== The EKR today as a Heritage Railway ==

A preservation group was formed in 1987 to preserve part of the abandoned line as far as the old coal mine at Tilmanstone. By 1989 a majority of the lineside vegetation had been cleared and by 1995 the first heritage train was run.

Following the reopening of the railway, a new platform was constructed on the site of the former equivalent at Eythorne and the former signalbox from Selling was moved to the northern end of the platform in the mid 1990s. The railway also owns the Barham Signal Box from the closed Elham Valley Line which houses a detailed mural painting of the old East Kent Railway route, this can be found at Shepherdswell.

The EKR operates on most Sundays and Bank Holidays between April and September.

The EKR also owns an extensive ancient woodland known as &quot;The Knees&quot;. The railway uses The Knees as an educational resource, woodland walks - the bluebells in spring are a popular attraction and for special events such as halloween.

The railway hosts other groups, including the Southern Electric Group, 400 Series Preservation and the 427 Locomotive Group. The Network SouthEast Railway Society also have a facility here in the form of a display container which is splendidly painted in the classic Toothpaste Livery.

The railway hosts two apprenticeship schemes for Permanent Way and Civil Engineering training. The railway also hosts other organisations and offers facilities for 3rd parties to undertake training.

<doc id="980207" wikidata="Q7102556" url="?curid=980207" title="Original Oratory">
<text>Original Oratory (often shortened to &quot;OO&quot;) is a competitive event in the National Speech and Debate Association, Stoa USA, National Catholic Forensic League, and other high school forensic competitions in which competitors deliver an original, factual speech on a subject of their choosing. Though the rules for the category change from organization to organization, a speech must generally be written and memorized by the performer and should be no more than ten minutes in length, and at most only 150 words can be quoted. The finished speech must be approved by the National Speech and Debate Association. This speech is frequently highly persuasive and is normally about a slightly controversial topic. An orator is given free choice of subject and judged solely on the effectiveness of development and presentation.

Oratory topics are usually related to current problems in the world, and are delivered in a persuasive way as to motivate the audience to make a choice. However, this may not always be the case. Some speeches may alert the audience of an imminent threat or inspire them to act now to initiate change. According to the National Speech and Debate Association, the competitor is judged on:
* the degree to which the inspiration or purpose of the speech elicits a reaction from the audience.
* gestures performed by the speaker to help the audience visualize ideas better.
* evidence which supports the speaker&#x27;s assertions.
* the veracity of the speech.

== Judges ==

Judges are typically Original Oratory competitors, coaches, sponsors, parents, or friends of the host tournament. Coaches are prohibited from judging their own schools, and alumni competitors must wait two years before they are allowed to judge the school from which they graduated. In some states and leagues, alumni are not allowed to judge the school from which they graduated for up to four years to prevent biased judgement on one&#x27;s former teammates.

<doc id="980211" wikidata="Q180416" url="?curid=980211" title="Das Experiment">
<text>&#x27; (English: The Experiment&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a 2001 German drama thriller film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. It is based on Mario Giordano&#x27;s novel &quot;Black Box&quot; and deals with a social experiment which resembles Philip Zimbardo&#x27;s Stanford prison experiment of 1971.

==Plot==
While reading a newspaper advertisement, taxi driver Tarek Fahd discovers an invitation to participate in an experiment, in which 4,000 German marks are offered to the participants of a simulation of a prison situation. The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in.

Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. After a car accident he suffers shortly before the experiment, Tarek meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists.

In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as the obligation to completely finish their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoner&#x27;s name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner number 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards&#x27; superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner&#x27;s lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates Steinhoff and Schütte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after only a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached, but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him.

The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners&#x27; fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners&#x27; side, this is Tarek, and on the guards&#x27; side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: &quot;Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles.&quot; From that moment on, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners. The scientists engage in a discussion whether or not to abort the experiment. Dr. Grimm suggests putting an end to the alarming situation, but Professor Thon refuses to stop the experiment until the violence has reached a maximum.

Dora meanwhile returns to Tarek&#x27;s apartment and discovers his participation contract for the experiment. She surprises him by showing up for a visit day. Tarek, who was forced to clean the toilet with his own clothes, pleads to the friendly guard Walther Bosch to secretly bring her a message. Berus intercepts Bosch, however, and tells Dora that everything is all right and refuses to let Tarek see Dora.

The situation becomes critical and more violence is involved. The prisoners are being abused and their self-esteem is drastically decreased by the guards&#x27; power. Most of the violence is directed against Tarek and he is locked up in solitary confinement inside a &quot;black box&quot; resembling a safe. Schütte, protesting this, is beaten severely, bound and gagged with duct tape and forced to sit on a chair. Later he suffocates to death due to his bloody nose drying up while gagged.

Bosch is beaten by the other guards for his &quot;betrayal&quot; and is put into confinement. Lars, a member of Thon&#x27;s team, notices this and attempts to contact Professor Thon, who is attending a conference. The guards, who are aware that the professor cannot be reached by phone, are convinced by Berus that the entire situation is a test put up by Thon&#x27;s team, in order to make the guards handle an exceptional situation. They take over control of the facility and capture Lars, Dr. Grimm and the other scientists, who are put into confinement as well, and gradually start their own prison in which they engage in brutally sadistic games with total control.

Dora comes to the facility a second time to speak to Tarek and is lured into a room by Berus, where he locks her up. Dr. Grimm is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape while the guard Eckert attempts to rape her. He is stopped by Tarek, who escaped from solitary confinement through the use of a screwdriver that he found inside the &quot;black box&quot;. Tarek knocks down Eckert and frees Lars, Bosch, Steinhoff, Dr. Grimm and the other prisoners. They manage to escape by removing the wall paneling of one of the cells with the screwdriver. Meanwhile, Professor Thon hears Lars&#x27; desperate message in his voicemail and leaves for the facility.

Meanwhile, Steinhoff and Tarek stay behind in order to prevent Berus from coming after them. Professor Thon reaches the facility and demands an explanation from Eckert, who accidentally injures him with a pistol. The fleeing prisoners are ambushed by the guards and trapped. Bosch, who could not keep up with the others, loses his sanity and kills Eckert with a fire extinguisher. Dora then escapes the room she was locked up in, and steals Eckert&#x27;s gun. She injures one of the guards while he is engaged in fighting Tarek and Steinhoff, leaving only Berus to fight them. Tarek incapacitates Berus, who is nearly choked to death by Steinhoff until Tarek convinces him not to kill Berus.

The film ends with a news break, confirming two deaths (Schütte and Eckert) and three severely injured (Thon, Berus, and Bosch). Both Berus and Thon will be put on trial, Berus for multiple homicides and torture with rape, and Thon for allowing an illegal and unethical experiment. In last scene Dora and Tarek are sitting together happily on the beach.

==Production==
The film was inspired by the events of the Stanford prison experiment in the US. It is based on the novel &quot;Black Box&quot; by Mario Giordano.

==Release and reception==
 premiered on 7 March 2001 in Berlin and was released with a theatrical release in Germany one day later. In the UK it was released on 22 March 2002 as &quot;The Experiment&quot; and in the United States on 20 September 2002.

In a positive review, Roger Ebert stated that he was impressed by the film&#x27;s effectiveness, even though he viewed its outcome as predetermined. According to Karen Durbin of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the movie can be seen as an allegory for the rise of authoritarian governments such as the Nazi regime.

==Remake==

An American remake released in 2010 was directed by Paul Scheuring and stars Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Maggie Grace, and Cam Gigandet. Filming began in Iowa in July 2009. When the film was still shooting, the North American distribution rights were acquired by Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group, which released the film direct-to-video in the United States on 21 September 2010 through its Stage 6 Films label.

<doc id="980216" wikidata="Q2516180" url="?curid=980216" title="Car club">
<text>A car club or automotive enthusiast community is a group of people who share a common interest in motor vehicles. Car clubs are typically organized by enthusiasts around the type of vehicle (e.g. Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Mustang), brand (e.g. Jeep), or similar interest (e.g. off-roading). Traditional car clubs were off-line organizations, but automotive on-line communities have flourished on the internet.

==Traditional car clubs==

Car clubs have been a form of gathering car aficionados for many years that focus a passion for a certain type of car or driving activity.

Historically, car clubs refer to off-line entities, typically organized as non-profits and run by volunteers (who were most often elected). Some clubs were large enough to be run as a paid business with salaried employees; in the 1960s, some were sponsored by car dealers.

Many car clubs charge membership fees in exchange for benefits, such as publications and events. The publications typically contain photographs, messages from other members, service and parts advice, items and vehicles wanted and/or for sale, and historical material of interest to the membership. Car clubs often host gatherings (called &quot;meets&quot;) which often also welcome interested non-members. Car clubs also may engage in other activities of various types, including races, cruising, shows, &quot;mod&quot; days when garage equipment and service tools are available for members to perform and assist each other with DIY work, or community service activities. Meets are a time for the club to be with one another, talk about cars, and participate in other activities, such as eating, sightseeing, movies, etc.

Additionally, some car clubs have a &quot;prospecting&quot; status, where prospective members of the club meet with established club members, to assess their suitability within the club. During this time, prospective members will help work on club cars, attend events, and sometimes perform tasks; such as helping to park cars at a show, or assisting with ticket sales, etc. Upon the completion of their prospect status, members will be &quot;patched in,&quot; whereupon they are considered full members of the club. In traditional car clubs in the US, this is typically signified by the awarding of a jacket or T-shirt with the club&#x27;s name and logo on the back, and the awarding of a metal &quot;drag plate,&quot; to be hung on the car, displaying their membership status and club name.

Many (if not most) traditional car clubs have now added online presences, although most of the content typically resides in a walled garden for members only. Most clubs have an online presence mainly through their car forums relevant to their car of interest. Some clubs also have their website. They usually use the forums or their site to organize their meets and gatherings. For example, before a big event, they would organize to see how many people are going, where to meet up, and how to caravan to their destination. Many car club members consider what they do to be not merely a hobby, but a lifestyle.

==Internet communities==
The Internet accelerated the growth of participation as online communities attracted large numbers of members. The Internet encouraged and fostered the development of many clubs centered on specific vehicles, including niche makes and models.

Unlike traditional clubs, the content of most online communities is open to all for free. This has facilitated their growth and made them a resource for potential owners or newbies. Larger online communities report registered members in the hundreds of thousands. The Internet communities typically provide features such as forums, content databases (which include vehicle specifications, driving characteristics, repair information, and car tuning advice), Instant messaging services, photo-sharing, and commercial services (such as for sale by owner listings, part supplier directories, and referrals to mechanics and car dealers).

Most automotive communities were founded by individual enthusiasts/entrepreneurs, but some have been acquired by various internet and communication companies.

As with traditional car clubs, some Internet automotive communities sponsor or operate off-line meets. Many of the leading Internet communities feature active directories of regional meets.

Communities have also begun to form around digital media outlets such as YouTube channels and podcasts. Car enthusiasts can comment and share opinions, allowing for an element of connection not found with other media variants. These platforms are being used by smaller studios and individuals to distribute content to a mass audience without needing a large budget. Production value is often high given the technology available to amateurs in the forms of software, cameras, microphones, and other producing equipment.

<text>Pavel Jozef Šafárik (; 13 May 1795 – 26 June 1861) was an ethnic Slovak philologist, poet, literary historian, historian and ethnographer in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was one of the first scientific Slavists.

==Family==
His father Pavol Šafárik (1761–1831) was a Protestant clergyman in Kobeliarovo and before that a teacher in Štítnik, where he was also born. His mother, Katarína Káresová (1764–1812) was born in a poor lower gentry family in Hanková and had several jobs in order to help the family in the poor region of Kobeliarovo.

P.J. Šafárik had two elder brothers and one elder sister. One brother, Pavol Jozef as well, died before Šafárik was born. In 1813, after Katarína&#x27;s death, Šafárik&#x27;s father married the widow Rozália Drábová, although Šafárik and his brothers and sister were against this marriage. The local teacher provided Šafárik with Czech books.

On 17 June 1822, when he was in Novi Sad (see below), P. J. Šafárik married 19-year-old Júlia Ambrózy de Séden (; 1803–1876), a highly intelligent member of Hungarian lower gentry born in 1803 in modern-day Serbia.

She spoke Slovak, Czech, Serbian and Russian, and supported Šafárik in his scientific work. In Novi Sad, they also had three daughters (Ľudmila, Milena, Božena) and two sons (Mladen Svatopluk, Vojtěch), but the first two daughters and the first son died shortly after their birth. Upon Šafárik&#x27;s arrival in Prague, they had 6 more children, out of which one died shortly after its birth.

His eldest son Vojtěch (1831–1902) became an important chemist, Jaroslav (1833–1862) became a military doctor and later the supreme assistant at the Joseph Academy in Vienna, Vladislav (born 1841) became a professional soldier, and Božena (born 1831) married Josef Jireček (1825–1888), a Czech literary historian, politician and a tutor in Šafarík&#x27;s family. Vojtech wrote an interesting biography of his father – &quot;Co vyprávěl P. J. Šafařík&quot; (What Šafárik said) – and the son of Božena and Jireček the study &quot;Šafařík mezi Jihoslovany&quot; (Šafárik among the Southern Slavs).

==Life==
===Early years (1795–1815)===
Pavel spent his childhood in the region of Kobeliarovo in northern Gemer (Gömör) characterized by attractive nature and rich Slovak culture. He gained his basic education from his father. As P. J. Šafárik&#x27;s son Vojtech put it later in his book (see Family):
In 1805–08 Šafárik studied at a &quot;lower gymnasium&quot; (in some sources described as Protestant school which was just changed into a middle Latin school) in Rožňava (Rozsnyó), where he learned Latin, German and Hungarian. Since he did not have enough money to finance his studies, he continued his studies in Dobšiná (Dobsina) for two years, because he could live there with his sister.

At that time, it was absolutely necessary for anyone who wanted to become a successful scientist in the Kingdom of Hungary (which included today&#x27;s Slovakia) to have a good command of Latin, German, and Hungarian. Since the school in Rožňava specialized in Hungarian and the school in Dobšiná in German, and Šafárik was an excellent student and both schools had a good reputation, all prerequisites for a successful career were fulfilled as early as at the age of 15.

In 1810–1814 he studied at the Evangelical lyceum of Kežmarok (Késmárk), where he got to know many Polish, Serbian and Ukrainian students and his most important friend Ján Blahoslav Benedikti, with whom they together read texts of Slovak and Czech national revivalists, especially those of Josef Jungmann. He was also familiarized with classical literature and German esthetics (also thanks to the excellent library of the lyceum), and started to show interest in Serbian culture.

He graduated from the following branches of study: philosophy (including logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, &quot;economia ruralis&quot;, Latin style, comparative philosophy and history of the Kingdom of Hungary), politics and law (including &quot;jus naturae&quot;, &quot;jus privatum civile et criminale&quot;, &quot;scienciae politicae&quot;), and theology (including dogmatic and moral theology, hermeneutics, Greek, Hebrew, physics, medicine, natural law, state law and international law). The studies at this school were very important; since this was a largely German school, he was able to get a (partial) scholarship for a university in Germany.

He worked as a private tutor in the family of Dávid Goldberger in Kežmarok between 1812 and 1814, which he also did one year after the end of his studies in Kežmarok. His mother died in late 1812 and his father remarried 6 months later. His first larger work was a volume of poems entitled &quot;The Muse of Tatras with a Slavonic Lyre&quot; published in 1814 (see Works). The poems were written in the old-fashioned standard of the Moravian Protestant translation of the Bible that the Slovak Lutherans used in their publications with many elements from Slovak and some from Polish.

===Germany (1815–1817)===
In 1815 he began to study at the University of Jena, where he turned from a poet into a scientist. It was the wish of his father, who financed him, to study there.

He attended lectures in history, philology, philosophy and natural sciences (lectures held by the professors Fries, Oken, Luden, and Eichenstädt), studied books of Herder and Fichte, was observing current literature and studied classical literature. While there he translated into Czech the &quot;Clouds&quot; of Aristophanes (issued in the Časopis Českého musea [Journal of the Bohemian museum] in 1830) and the &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; of Schiller (issued in 1831).

In 1816, he became a member of the Latin Society of Jena. 17 of Šafárik&#x27;s poems written at this time (1815–16) appeared in the &quot;Prvotiny pěkných umění&quot; by Hromádka in Vienna and made Šafárik well known among the Slovaks and the Czech lands. In Jena, which Šafárik liked very much, he mainly learned to apply scientific methods and found a lot of new friends. One of them was the important Slovak writer Ján Chalupka, and another one, Samuel Ferjenčík, introduced him to Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Although he was an excellent student, Šafárik had to leave the University of Jena in May 1817 for unknown reasons (probably lack of money).

In 1817, on his way back home, he visited Leipzig and Prague. In Prague, where he was searching for a tutor job, he spent one month and joined the literary circle, whose members were Josef Dobrovský, Josef Jungmann and Václav Hanka, whom Šafárik thus got to know in person.

===Return to homeland (1817–1833)===
Between the summer of 1817 and June 1819, he worked as a tutor in Pressburg (Bratislava) in the well-known family of Gašpar Kubínyi. He also became a good friend of the Czech František Palacký, with whom he had already exchanged letters before and who was also a tutor in Pressburg at that time. The town of Pressburg was a social and intellectual center of the Kingdom of Hungary at that time. In the spring of 1819, Šafárik befriended the important Slovak writer and politician Ján Kollár.

Before he left for the southern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Serbia), Šafárik spent some time in Kobeliarovo and with his grandfather in Hanková. This was the last time Šafárik saw his native country.
In April 1819, his friend Ján Blahoslav Benedikti helped him to get a doctor&#x27;s degree, which he needed in order to become headmaster of a new gymnasium in Novi Sad (Újvidék), in the south of the Kingdom of Hungary, where he befriended the teacher and writer Georgije Magarašević. From 1819 to 1833 he was headmaster and teacher at the Serbian Orthodox gymnasium at Novi Sad. All other teachers at the gymnasium were Serbs, including novelist Milovan Vidaković, who taught there at the same time as Šafárik. He himself taught mathematics, physics, logic, rhetoric, poetry, stylistics and classic literature in Latin, German, and when Magyarization (Hungarisation) by the authorities intensified, also in Hungarian. From 1821 onwards, he also worked as a tutor of the son of the nephew of Metropolitan Stefan Stratimirović. In 1824 he had to renounce the post of headmaster because the Austrian government prohibited the Serbian Orthodox Church from employing Protestants from the Kingdom of Hungary. This caused Šafárik, who had to finance his newly arisen family, to lose a substantial source of income. He therefore tried to find a teaching position in his native country, but for various reasons he did not succeed. In Novi Sad he studied Serbian literature and antiquities, and he acquired many rare – especially Old Church Slavonic – books and manuscripts, which he used in Prague later. He also published a collection of Slovak folk songs and sayings in collaboration with Ján Kollár and others (&quot;see Works&quot;). In 1826 his &quot;Geschichte der slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach allen Mundarten&quot; was published. This book was the first attempt to give anything like a systematic account of the Slavonic languages as a whole.

===Bohemia (1833–1861)===
In 1832 he finally decided to leave Novi Sad and tried to find a teacher or librarian job in Russia, but again without success. In 1833, with the help of Ján Kollár and on invitation of influential friends in Prague who promised to finance him, he went to Prague, where he spent the remainder of his life. During his entire stay in Prague, especially in the 1840s, his very existence depended on the 380 florins he received annually from his Czech friends under the condition which explicitly expressed František Palacký: &quot;From now on, anything you write, you will write it in Czech only.&quot; Šafárik was an editor of the journal &quot;Světozor&quot; (1834–1835). In 1837 poverty compelled him to accept the uncongenial office of censor of Czech publications, which he abandoned in 1847. Between 1838 and 1842 he was first editor, later conductor, of the journal &quot;Časopis Českého musea&quot;, since 1841 he was a custodian of the Prague University Library. In Prague, he published most of his works, especially his greatest work &quot;Slovanské starožitnosti&quot; (&quot;Slavonic Antiquities&quot;) in 1837. He also edited the first volume of the &quot;Výbor&quot; (selections from old Czech writers), which appeared under the auspices of the Prague literary society in 1845. To this he prefixed a grammar of Old Czech (&quot;Počátkové staročeské mluvnice&quot;).

In the papers collection &quot;Hlasowé o potřebě jednoty spisowného jazyka pro Čechy, Morawany a Slowáky&quot; (&quot;Voices on the necessity of a united standard language for the Bohemians, Moravians and Slovaks&quot;) published by Ján Kollár in 1846, Šafárik moderately criticized Ľudovít Štúr&#x27;s introduction of a new Slovak standard language (1843) that replaced the previously used Lutheran standard which was closer to the Czech language (the Slovak Catholics used a different standard). Šafárik – as opposed to most of his Czech colleagues – always considered the Slovaks a separate nation from the Czechs (e.g. explicitly in his works &quot;Geschichte der slawischen Sprache...&quot; and in &quot;Slovanský národopis&quot;) but he advocated the use of Slovacized Czech (&quot;Slovak style of the Czech language&quot;) as the only standard language among the Slovak people.

During the Revolution of 1848 he was mainly collecting material for books on the oldest Slavic history. In 1848 he was made head of the University Library of Prague and a masterful professor of Slavonic philology in the University of Prague, but resigned to the latter in 1849 and remained head of the university library only. The reason for this resignation was that during the Revolution of 1848–49 he participated at the Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848 and thus became suspicious for Austrian authorities. During the absolutistic period following the defeat of the revolution (so-called Bach&#x27;s absolutism), he lived a secluded life and studied especially older Czech literature and Old Church Slavonic texts and culture.

In 1856/57, as a result of persecution anxieties, overwork, and ill health, he became physically and mentally ill and burned most of his correspondence with important personalities (e.g. with Ján Kollár). In May 1860, his depressions made him jump into the Vltava river, but he was saved. This event produced considerable sensation among the general public. In early October 1860 he asked for retirement from his post as University Library head. The Austrian emperor himself enabled him this in a letter written by his majesty himself and granted him a pension, which corresponded to Šafárik&#x27;s previous full pay. 

Šafárik died in 1861 in Prague and was buried in the evangelical cemetery in Karlín Quarter.

<doc id="980232" wikidata="Q612034" url="?curid=980232" title="Timocharis (crater)">
<text>Timocharis is a prominent lunar impact crater located on the Mare Imbrium. It was named after ancient Greek astronomer Timocharis. The closest crater of comparable dimensions is Lambert to the west. The smaller craters Feuillée and Beer lie to the east of Timocharis.

The rim of Timocharis has a somewhat polygonal outline, with an outer that extends over 20 kilometers in all directions. The interior wall is slumped and sharply terraced. The center of the floor is occupied by a craterlet that lies on a slight rise. This impact has almost completely removed the original central peak. The crater may have a minor ray system that extends for over .

The crater is likely to have been formed in the Eratosthenian, between 3.2 and 1.1 Billion years ago, as it lacks a prominent ray system, but has not been significantly eroded by impacts.

Timocharis is a potential target for lunar exploration due to its young age, which may give information on the formation of central peak craters elsewhere on the lunar surface.

To the north of Timocharis is a tiny crater chain named the Catena Timocharis. THere are also a number of smaller craters in the immediate vicinity - notably Heinrich, Landsteiner, and Pupin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Timocharis.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Timocharis A — &quot;See&quot; Heinrich (crater).
* Timocharis F — &quot;See&quot; Landsteiner (crater).
* Timocharis K — &quot;See&quot; Pupin (crater).

<doc id="980233" wikidata="Q6273462" url="?curid=980233" title="Sunspot, New Mexico">
<text>Sunspot is an unincorporated community in the Sacramento Mountains in the Lincoln National Forest in Otero County, New Mexico, United States, about south of Cloudcroft. Its elevation is . The Sunspot Solar Observatory and Apache Point Observatory are located in Sunspot in the Sacramento Mountains. The site of Sunspot is leased by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from the US Forest Service (USFS), and is operated and maintained by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The telescope and site are both open to the public, and the visitors center offers guided tours of the site on Saturdays and Sundays. On other days there is a self-guided 1/2 mile trail around the telescope and White Sands overlook.

==History==
Sunspot is an unincorporated community located the Lincoln National Forest which has a diverse range of native flora and fauna including more than 200 species of birds, as well as mule deer.

It was named after the presence of the National Solar Observatory on Sacramento Peak, in a vote that was allegedly rigged by the observatory&#x27;s director John Evans. The road leading to Sunspot from Cloudcroft is New Mexico State Road 6563, named for the brightest wavelength of hydrogen emission, H-alpha. This scenic byway features signposts marking the relative locations of the planets from the sun in proportion to their distance to Sunspot.

==Temporary closure and conspiracies==

On September 6, 2018, AURA voluntarily evacuated the site of Sunspot for security reasons. This prompted the formation of multiple conspiracy theories, including presence of aliens, military intelligence operations, impending solar storms, and FBI raids. These all originated from false information provided by the local sheriff.

A local TV station provided a call-in from a supposed employee with a disguised voice, although this was later found to be faked by the reporter. On September 17 AURA re-opened Sunspot, following an investigation into criminal activity involving Apache Point Observatory personnel. Later, court documents reported that the closure was due to threats from the Apache Point Observatory janitor who was subsequently the center of a federal investigation. During the course of the investigation, AURA had decided to evacuate the site and terminated the contract that had been held by the janitor. Apache Point Observatory had not been closed despite the ongoing presence of the suspect at that location during the investigation. The suspect was known by a few others who had been previously removed from Sunspot, or fired. Once the threat was no longer present, Sunspot was reopened by AURA.

==Future==
On September 24, 2018 Wired magazine published an article on the observatory. It stated that &quot;Assuming New Mexico State gets a contract that goes till 2021, the site’s ultimate future may still be in flux. The National Science Foundation presented four potential ending options, and their impacts, earlier this year.&quot; Of these 4, NSF determined to keep Sunspot in operation in partnership with New Mexico State University.

==Education==
It is zoned to Cloudcroft Municipal Schools.

<text>Peter King, 1st Baron King, (c. 1669 – 22 July 1734), commonly referred to as Lord King, was an English lawyer and politician, who became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Life==
King was born in Exeter in 1669, and educated at Exeter Grammar School.
In his youth he was interested in early church history, and published anonymously in 1691 &quot;An Enquiry into the Constitution, Discipline, Unity and Worship of the Primitive Church that flourished within the first Three Hundred Years after Christ&quot;. This treatise engaged the interest of his cousin, John Locke, the philosopher, by whose advice his father sent him to the Leiden University, where he stayed for nearly three years. He entered the Middle Temple in 1694 and was called to the bar in 1698.

In 1700 he was returned to Parliament of England as the member for Bere Alston in Devon, holding the seat until 1715.

He was appointed recorder of Glastonbury in 1705 and recorder of London in 1708. Made a Serjeant-at-Law, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1714 to 1725, when he was raised to the peerage as a Lord Justice and Speaker of the House of Lords. In June of the same year he was made Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, holding office until compelled by a paralytic stroke to resign in 1733.

He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 14 November 1728.

He died at Ockham, Surrey, on 22 July 1734 and was buried in All Saints&#x27; Church. In 1735, the King Chapel was added to the church, separated from the main aisle by a round headed, and there is a vaulted plaster ceiling springing from angle pilasters. Intended as a chapel over the family vault of the Lords King of Ockham and their descendants, the Earls of Lovelace, it features several church monuments, including the monument to Peter King, 1st Baron King, and his wife Anne Seys, which was sculpted by Michael Rysbrack. It is on the north wall, white marble in Palladian style, with two figures sitting either side of large urn in front of pyramidal ground. Symbols of office surround Lord King.

==Family==
King married Anne Seys in 1704. They had six children: two daughters and four sons. Each of their sons succeeded in turn as Lord King, Baron of Ockham.

After his death in 1734, the widowed Lady King lived in Grosvenor Square until her death in 1767.

In 1835 his great-great-grandson William King (1805–1893), married Ada Byron, the only daughter of Lord Byron and was later created Earl of Lovelace. Another descendant Peter John Locke King was a Member of Parliament for Surrey from 1847 to 1849 and won some fame as an advocate of reform, being responsible for the passing of the Real Estate Charges Act 1854, and for the repeal of a large number of obsolete laws.

==Assessment as Lord Chancellor==

Lord King as chancellor failed to sustain the reputation which he had acquired at the common law bar. Nevertheless, he left his mark on English law by establishing the principles that a will of immovable property is governed by the &quot;lex loci rei sitae&quot;, and that where a husband had a legal right to the personal estate of his wife, which must be asserted by a suit in equity, the court would not help him unless he made a provision out of the property for the wife, if she required it. He was also the author of the Act (Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730) by virtue of which English superseded Latin as the language of the courts.

==Works==
Lord King published in 1702 a &quot;History of the Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot; (Leipzig, 1706; Basel, 1750) which went through several editions and was also translated into Latin. His earlier work &quot;An Enquiry into the Constitution, Discipline, Unity and Worship of the Primitive Church that flourished within the first Three Hundred Years after Christ&quot; was published 1691 and was quoted by &quot;John Wesley&quot; in many of his correspondences and is seen as influencing many of his view on the order of the Church.

==Cases==

Some notable cases on which he was involved:
*&quot;R v Woodburne and Coke&quot;
*&quot;Keech v Sandford&quot; (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61
*&quot;Coppin v Coppin&quot; (1725) – a will settling land in England must conform to the rules of English law, even when made abroad
*&quot;Croft v Pyke&quot; (1733) – a partner&#x27;s joint estate is liable first to the debts of the partnership, before payment of legacies to heirs
*&quot;Milner v Colmer&quot; (1731)
*&quot;Brown et Uxor v Elton&quot; (1733) – the practice of the court was to compel a husband to make a settlement on the wife before recovering his wife&#x27;s portion by equity
Spoke in support of the second article brought against Henry Sacheverell, February 28, 1709/10 – &#x27;Tryal of Dr.Sacheverell&#x27; printed London 1710

<text>A tachistoscope is a device that displays a picture, text, or an object for a specific amount of time. It can be used for various purposes such as to increase recognition speed, to show something too fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which elements of a display are memorable.

Early tachistoscopes were mechanical, using a flat masking screen that containing a window. The screen concealed the picture or text until the sceen moved, at a known speed, the window over the picture or text, revealing it. The screen continued to move until it hid the picture or text again. Later tachistoscopes used a shutter system typical of a camera in conjunction with a slide or transparency projector. Even later, tachistoscopes used brief illumination, such as from fast-onset and fast-offset fluorescent lamps, of the material to be displayed. By the late 1990s, tachistoscopes had largely been replaced by computers for displaying pictures and text.

== History ==
The first tachistoscope was originally described by the German physiologist A.W. Volkmann in 1859. Samuel Renshaw used it during World War II in the training of fighter pilots to help them identify aircraft silhouettes as friend or foe.

== Applications ==
Before computers became universal, tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research to present visual stimuli for controlled durations. Some experiments employed pairs of tachistoscopes so that an experimental participant could be given different stimulation in each visual field.

Tachistoscopes were used during the late 1960s in public schools as an aid to increased reading comprehension for speed reading. There were two types: the student would look through a lens similar to an aircraft bombsight viewfinder and read letters, words, and phrases using manually advanced slide film. The second type projected words and phrases on a screen in sequence. Both types were followed up with comprehension and vocabulary testing.

Tachistoscopes continue to be used in market research, where they are typically used to compare the visual impact, or memorability of marketing materials or packaging designs. Tachistoscopes used for this purpose still typically employ slide projectors rather than computer monitors, due to
* the increased fidelity of the image which can be displayed in this way and
* the opportunity to show large or life-size images.

<doc id="980242" wikidata="Q1881315" url="?curid=980242" title="MDK">
<text>MDK is a 1997 third-person shooter video game developed by Shiny Entertainment for Windows and subsequently ported to Mac OS by Shokwave, and to the PlayStation by Neversoft. The game was published on all systems by Playmates Interactive Entertainment (PIE) in North America, while Shiny handled the European release.

The game tells the story of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who reluctantly attempts to save Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-sized vehicles named &quot;Minecrawlers&quot;. The Minecrawlers are ruthlessly harvesting Earth&#x27;s natural resources and crushing any people and cities that get in their way. Assisted by his somewhat eccentric boss, Dr. Fluke Hawkins, an inventive scientist, and an unusual robotic companion named Bones, Kurt embarks on a quest to infiltrate each Minecrawler and eliminate its pilot. After accomplishing this dangerous task, he must return to Dr. Hawkins&#x27; in-orbit space station, the Jim Dandy.

Conceived and co-designed by Nick Bruty, &quot;MDK&quot; was Shiny&#x27;s first PC game, and was notable for using software rendering, requiring a Pentium or equivalent microprocessor, rather than necessitating any GPU enhancements, despite its large 3D levels and complex polygonal enemies. As the developers were attempting very ambitious things, they wrote their own programming language. Additionally, when in sniper mode, the player has the ability to zoom up to 100x, but the developers chose not to employ any of the standard solutions to pop-up, such as clipping or fogging. They also worked to ensure the game ran at a minimum of 30 fps at all times on all machines. The game&#x27;s original system requirements were a 60 MHz Pentium, 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage, an SVGA-compatible video card, and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card.

&quot;MDK&quot; received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, the level design, the sardonic sense of humor, the game&#x27;s technical accomplishments, and the use of sniper mode. The most often repeated criticisms included that the game was too short, and the story was weak. The game was a commercial success, and Interplay approached Bruty to work on a sequel immediately. However, he was already developing &quot;&quot;, so BioWare was hired to develop the game. &quot;MDK2&quot; was published for Windows and the Dreamcast in 2000, and for the PlayStation 2 (as &quot;MDK 2: Armageddon&quot;) in 2001. In 2007, Interplay announced a third game was planned, but it was never made.

==Gameplay==
For the most part, &quot;MDK&quot; is a run-and-gun third-person shooter. It also features several minigames, and allows the player to enter first-person mode at any time they wish to use their sniper weapon. The basic design of the game involves distinct levels in which the player character, Kurt Hectic, must infiltrate a &quot;Minecrawler&quot;, fight his way through an array of enemies, tackle some rudimentary puzzles, and reach the control center, where he must then eliminate the pilot in a boss fight. Every level is completely different; enemies, level design, aesthetic, and control center layout, with a different strategy required to eliminate each pilot.

During the run-and-gun gameplay, the player must frequently use Kurt&#x27;s &quot;ribbon chute&quot;, a parachute contained within his outfit that can be used indefinitely. The chute allows Kurt to make long jumps, survive long falls, and utilize updrafts. It deploys immediately and retracts automatically when not being used. Kurt also has access to a smart bomb feature, where he can call Max to fly a bomber over the battle area and drop bombs on the enemies. To call Max, Kurt must have collected an airstrike pickup within the game. He must enter sniper mode to select the area he wants Max to target. Additionally, the airstrike can only be used in exterior locations on the Minecrawler. Other weaponry in the game includes grenades, &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Interesting Bomb&quot; (when Kurt throws the bomb, all enemies within the vicinity will approach it, at which point Kurt can detonate it), &quot;The Very Large Hamster Hammer&quot; (a giant hammer that causes the ground to vibrate violently, damaging any nearby enemies), and &quot;The World&#x27;s Smallest Nuclear Explosion&quot; (used for opening locked doors).

In addition to the run-and-gun/sniper modes, there are several additional gameplay modes in &quot;MDK&quot;. All levels start out with an &quot;atmospheric entry&quot; in which Kurt jumps from his base ship, the &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; space station, which is in orbit around Earth, to the Minecrawler on the planet&#x27;s surface. As he descends, the Minecrawler activates its radar, which, if touched, triggers the launch of anti-air missiles, which must be dodged. Some levels feature Kurt taking over an enemy bombing ship and performing bombing runs, some feature a glider which Kurt must ride to a specific location. One level features several snowboarding sequences, where Kurt must navigate obstacles while destroying enemies. Additionally, once a level has been completed, the Minecrawler disintegrates, and is sucked back into the energy stream from which it emerged, taking Kurt with it. Kurt then has a set period of time in the energy stream, during which he pursues a health power-up, which, if collected, grants 150% health for the start of the next level. If he touches the walls of the stream, he loses health and decelerates. At the end of the set period, Max will enter the stream on a tether and pull Kurt back to the &quot;Jim Dandy&quot;.
Kurt&#x27;s main defense against his enemies is his &quot;Coil Suit&quot;, a skin-tight armor made of a Kevlar-like material, and created on a &quot;nuclear-blast proof sewing machine&quot;. This suit serves as a bulletproof vest during the combat sections of the game, and also protects Kurt from friction and heat during the atmospheric entry sections. Kurt&#x27;s weapon is a chain gun, which is attached to his arm, and carries unlimited ammo. The other major weapon in the game is a sniper gun. This is created when Kurt detaches his chain gun from his arm and mounts it onto his helmet. The sniper weapon can zoom up to 100x, and has the capability of supporting five different types of ammunition, including homing missiles and mortar shells. Kurt does not actually see out of the helmet, rather, he sees out of a HUD, which he uses to aim. There are also three &quot;Bullet Cams&quot; that track each projectile and linger briefly after impact, showing any damage done. However, when Kurt is in sniper mode, he is unable to move, and can thus be easily targeted by enemies.

The enemies in &quot;MDK&quot; are a collective of aliens called &quot;Streamriders&quot; under the command of Gunter Glut. Each Minecrawler is manned primarily by various types of soldiers named &quot;Grunts.&quot; Some areas contain &quot;Grunt generators&quot; which create an infinite number of enemies until destroyed. Apart from Grunts, and each Minecrawler&#x27;s unique pilot, Kurt also encounters various types of robots, tanks, automated and manned turrets, animals, small attack ships, troop transport ships, and sentry drones.

==Plot==
The story of the game begins in 1996 when inventor/scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins believes he has made a revolutionary discovery; an outer space phenomenon he calls &quot;Flange Orbits&quot;. However, when he approaches the scientific community with his discovery, he is ridiculed. Determined to prove his colleagues wrong, Hawkins builds a space station, the &quot;Jim Dandy&quot;, and bribes aboard his laboratory janitor, Kurt Hectic, by means of Hungarian goulash. He then launches the station into orbit, projecting that the mission will last five days. However, after a week, Hawkins realizes Flange Orbits do not actually exist, but rather than return to Earth in shame, he decides to remain on the &quot;Dandy&quot; to try to discover something, anticipating another week in space. Kurt is extremely unhappy with this development, but once Hawkins shows him how to program the VCR, he calms down.

A year later, having made no discoveries, Hawkins begins work building a genetically engineered robotic dog, which he plans to call &quot;Bones&quot;. After a year, Bones is fully operational, although both Bones and Kurt prefer the name Max. Despite having four arms and two legs, and being full of energy, Max proves more than a little reluctant to help Hawkins with the chores on the &quot;Dandy&quot;, proving more interested in tending to his vegetable garden.

Another year passes without Hawkins making a breakthrough until he notices streams of energy moving through the Solar System towards Earth. He sends a warning down to Earth (along with some of Max&#x27;s oranges), but it is ignored. Upon reaching Earth, the streams disgorge gigantic &quot;Minecrawlers&quot;, city-sized vehicles designed to strip mine the natural resources from a planet, crushing anything and everything in their path. The aliens, known as &quot;Streamriders&quot;, and under the command of Gunter Glut, easily demolish all of Earth&#x27;s military forces, and so Hawkins decides to take action to save the planet. Hawkins reasons the only way to fight the aliens is with his newly invented &quot;Coil Suit&quot;, but due to his advancing years and Max&#x27;s extra pair of legs, Kurt is the only one who can wear it, and, thus, becomes the very reluctant hero.

As such, Kurt is dispatched on &quot;Mission: Deliver Kindness&quot;. This involves Kurt entering the Minecrawlers from above, and destroying them from the inside-out, shooting his way through to the pilot, whom he then kills, before being extracted back to the &quot;Jim Dandy&quot;. Kurt fights his way through a number of Minecrawlers, destroying them one by one, until he reaches the Crawler piloted by Gunter Glut himself. Kurt destroys the final Minecrawler, but Glut captures Max, and escapes into an energy stream leading to his base ship. Kurt gives chase and frees Max, who tricks Glut into eating him. Max then kills Glut by exploding him from within. The two then escape and destroy Glut&#x27;s ship. The ending sequence is a monochrome mix of a French music video (&quot;Non Non Rien N&#x27;a Changé&quot; by Billy Ze Kick) and clips from the &quot;MDK&quot; promotional video.

==Development==
===Origins===
&quot;MDK&quot;″s writer, co-designer and co-artist Nick Bruty has said the initial impetus for the game was his desire to move away from the type of game on which he had previously been working; family-friendly games such as &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1993), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1993), &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; (1994) and &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot; (1995), all of which Bruty had worked on for the Sega Genesis. According to Bruty,

Bruty&#x27;s first image for the game was a doodle of an armor suit with a self-contained machine gun, and a helmet that could be used as a sniper rifle. Once he had this concept in place, he wrote a rough draft of the story, and brought together a small team of people with whom he had worked before; programmer Andy Astor, designer Tim Williams, artist and designer Bob Stevenson, animator Shawn Nelson and, later, programmer Martin Brownlow. One of the first decisions the team made was not to develop the game for the system with which they had the most experience, the Sega Genesis, but instead to develop it for the PC, making it Shiny&#x27;s first PC game.

Developing for the PC brought a number of advantages, not the least of which was it allowed the team to make the game using 3D computer graphics. As Bruty explains, &quot;I wanted to work on PC because the game was 3D, which wasn&#x27;t an option on consoles at that point.&quot; Tim Williams explains another advantage of working on PC was &quot;it meant I wouldn&#x27;t have to tone the game down to deal with the Sega and Nintendo&#x27;s ratings boards. I loved [the concept]. I could see the game immediately would have a unique look and plenty of design opportunities. We were all big fans of the &quot;Alien&quot; movies and H. R. Giger, so that probably had some influence.&quot; As Shiny intended the game to be gory, even going so far as to study tapes of people dying in gruesome manners to see the effects of violent deaths on the human body, this lack of censorship was ideal. Once the decision was made to develop for the PC, the team quickly decided they wanted to make a game that would push the boundaries of PC gaming beyond anything seen up to that point.

The naming of Kurt Hectic was inspired by two disparate sources. In the early stages of development, some of the team saw the 1993 Mike Leigh film, &quot;Naked&quot;, in which David Thewlis&#x27; character says to a junkie, &quot;What is it like in your head? Hectic?&quot; Bruty and Williams loved the line, and decided Hectic should be the character&#x27;s surname. When trying to think of his first name, they wanted to name him after someone who lived a notoriously hectic life, and settled on Kurt Cobain.

===Gameplay development===
At the time, the shooter game market was dominated by first-person shooters, most of which worked off the template set by &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. However, the developers were never interested in making a first-person shooter. Bruty was particularly passionate about this aspect of the game, arguing &quot;I feel the player is more involved in the world when they can see their own character.&quot; Williams agrees; &quot;We wanted the player to see all the cool actions the main character would be performing, so third-person was the natural choice and challenge we went for.&quot;

From the earliest stages of level design, it was decided each level would begin with a free-fall minigame, before the level proper begins. Initially, the plan was for Kurt to travel through each level on a futuristic motorcycle, which would morph around him to protect him and would be integrated into his Coil Suit. However, this idea was ultimately scrapped in favor of a more straightforward 3D &quot;run-and-gun&quot; style gameplay. Another early concept that was scrapped was that sniper mode would only be available to the player during the boss fight at the end of each level. This was changed so the player could use sniper mode whenever they wished. An early concept which did make it into the final game was the notion of ridiculous weaponry. One of the first such weapons conceived was the &quot;World&#x27;s Smallest Nuclear Bomb,&quot; as the team wanted to come up with the most over-the-top way imaginable to open a door.

===Visual design===
Each level in the game was crafted by a different designer, resulting in a diverse and distinct visual experience throughout. To achieve lifelike movements for Kurt and the enemies, the developers utilized motion capture, a groundbreaking technology in video game development at that time. Unlike previous motion capture implementations, they broke down the motion scripts for individual limbs, enabling them to mix and match animations, leading to a broader range of movements.

Creating Kurt&#x27;s character involved a critical consideration: ensuring a seamless transition between third-person and sniper modes. To tackle this challenge, the developers ingeniously designed Kurt&#x27;s sniper rifle to be the same as his machine gun, allowing him to attach the gun to his helmet effortlessly. This decision aligned well with the game&#x27;s theme, making Kurt&#x27;s Coil Suit a self-contained and versatile offensive/defensive ensemble. When designing the suit, Bruty drew inspiration from elegant and ornate Spanish armor, seeking to bring more flair to the character&#x27;s appearance.

During atmospheric entry sequences, a 3D model of Kurt was employed, while pre-rendered sprites were predominantly used during gameplay for optimal performance. Zeschuk found inspiration for Max&#x27;s character in figures like Chow Yun-fat, Snoopy and Gromit. He described the Doctor as an archetypal kooky inventor and Kurt as the straight man - the ordinary person navigating a bizarre world.

The process of designing enemies involved sketching each type on paper before constructing a 3D wire-frame model, which was then integrated into the gaming environment. Subsequently, these models were transformed into texture-mapped polygons and animated using data gathered from the motion capture system. The attention to detail extended to larger enemies, whose polygon structures allowed players to target specific body parts, such as legs, arms, and even the eyes of certain adversaries.

===Technology===
MDK attempted things never before seen in a PC game, so the team decided to write their own programming language. Rather than having the programmers write the language, the designers and artists also worked on it, allowing a more collaboratively creative atmosphere than is usual, and facilitating the language to work specifically to accommodate the elements of the game which the designers and artists wished to achieve.

Sniper mode was a major part of the game, with the ability to zoom up to 100x. The team decided not to employ any of the usual techniques to limit pop-up, such as clipping and fogging. A major technical issue was the frame rate. Shiny felt most PC games maintained frame rate by using big pixels in low resolution, which works as long as the game is not running SVGA mode. Based on their experiences developing for consoles, they wanted to take a different approach; using small pixels in high resolution. They set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and play-tested the game multiple times. When the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate back up to where they wanted without having to reduce resolution or increase pixel size. According to Bruty, &quot;We had no idea how fast we could get the engine when we started. The game would run too slow if we textured everything, so some parts were just flat-shaded for speed. We did our best to make that look like a design choice, or shadows, but it was a tricky balance.&quot;

When the game debuted at the 1996 E3 event in April, producer David Perry emphasized that he felt Shiny&#x27;s lack of experience on the PC was to their advantage; &quot;instead of simply rewriting a game that&#x27;s already been written and having to meet a set of expectations, we can shoot really high.&quot;

&quot;MDK&quot; was designed at a time when 3D gaming was becoming popular, but GPUs hadn&#x27;t had much impact on game development, and as such, &quot;graphics would be designed to operate in software.&quot; Ultimately, the initial release of the game relied wholly on software rendering, without any additional GPU requirements. The game&#x27;s original system requirements were a 60 MHz Pentium (although 90 MHz was recommended), 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage for basic installation (37MB for full installation), an SVGA compatible video card, and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card; basic specs for the time. However, patches were later released that added support for then-popular 3D APIs.

===Mac OS port===
Playmates Interactive finalized the publishing deal for a Macintosh version of &quot;MDK&quot; in August 1997, but the conversion to the Macintosh OS had already been in development for some time before that. This version was bundled with the original iMac.

===PlayStation port===
In December 1996, it was revealed the game was being ported to the PlayStation by Neversoft. The Neversoft team had an initial deadline of six months. According to developer Mick West, the sheer size of the PC version presented problems for the port, but in some respects, the PlayStation version would improve on the PC version;

Because the PC version was still months away from completion when work on the PlayStation port began, the Neversoft team had to continually adjust their work in response to updates they received from Shiny.

===Meaning of &quot;MDK&quot;===
While the precise meaning of the title&#x27;s three-letter acronym is never revealed during the game, the gaming press and fans adopted &quot;Murder, Death, Kill&quot;, which was coined in the 1993 film &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. Another possibility is documented in the game manual, where Kurt&#x27;s mission is named &quot;Mission: Deliver Kindness&quot;. It could also stand for the first initials of the game&#x27;s characters; Max, Dr. Hawkins, and Kurt. In the README for the PC version of the game, it is stated &quot;It stands for whatever we say it stands for on any given day; i.e., today it stands for Mother&#x27;s Day Kisses...&quot; In the European PC release, the background images during installation present many possible meanings for the letters; one of which is &quot;Murder, Death, Kill&quot;. In the Japanese release, on the back cover it says in bold yellow letters: &quot;My Dear Knight&quot;. During the installation of &quot;MDK2&quot;, various meanings are shown, again including &quot;Murder, Death, Kill&quot;. The original meaning of &quot;MDK&quot; from the company&#x27;s initial promo video was in fact &quot;Murder Death Kill&quot;. In a 2009 interview with &quot;NowGamer&quot;, David Perry revealed that because the North American publisher PIE was supposed to make toys based on the game, they did not like the title, so the words were removed and simply replaced with &quot;MDK&quot;.

In 2011 on the official GOG.com forum for the game, Nick Bruty (creator of MDK) posted that the letters do indeed stand for &quot;Murder Death Kill&quot;.

===Digital re-release===
&quot;MDK&quot; became available digitally for newer Windows releases on GOG.com in September 2008 among the service&#x27;s first games. A macOS version was added on October 26, 2012.

==Reception==
It received generally positive reviews on both PC and PlayStation. The Windows version holds an aggregate score of 89% on GameRankings, based on five reviews. The PlayStation version holds a score of 76%, based on six reviews.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, stating that &quot;&quot;MDK&quot; is a game that no self-respective gamer will want to miss.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor), saying it &quot;easily lives up to all its rampant hype, delivering one of the year&#x27;s most creative, engrossing, and just plain fun games.&quot; The reviewer particularly applauded the &quot;floating third-person view&quot;, Kurt&#x27;s arsenal of abilities, the effective realization of the setting, and the varied gameplay experiences. Game Revolution&#x27;s Johnny Lee called the game &quot;Non-stop 3D shooting, killing, exploding, dodging, parachuting, running, ambushing, assassinating, jumping, mind blowing action!&quot; He commented that it stands out from other games with its requisite parachuting skills, sniping mode, bombing minigame, and acerbic sense of humor. He concluded &quot;&quot;MDK&quot; combines sweet graphics and &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; gameplay and design concepts to put it in a class by itself.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Sengstack called it &quot;a visually exciting, mentally challenging shooter with a humorous and twisted viewpoint.&quot; He praised the wide-open environments, variety of visual styles, gameplay innovations, sniper mode, humor, ingeniousness of the puzzle designs, and the originality of some of the weaponry and enemies, though he was critical of the controls and the short length of the game.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) and &quot;IGN&quot; both strongly approved of the quality of the PlayStation port, particularly citing the retention of all the content of the PC version and the addition of the new warp rooms. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jay Boor said it &quot;has to be one of the most impressive PC to PlayStation ports I have ever seen.&quot; However, &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that the graphics, though outstanding by PlayStation standards, were downgraded from the PC version, and judged that the new content was not enough to merit a replay from those who had already played the PC version. They nonetheless gave the PlayStation version a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (fun factor, graphics, sound, and control), remarking, &quot;&quot;MDK&quot; is riveting, combining tensely paced run-n-gun gameplay with the stealthy, strategic stalking that the sniper helmet enables.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; were not as convinced, citing polygon breakup, control issues, excessively low difficulty, and the brevity of the game. Crispin Boyer of &quot;EGM&quot; summarized, &quot;This heavily hyped shooter/platform hybrid is intense, fun, funny, over the top - and over way too soon.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Josh Smith wrote &quot;&quot;MDK&quot; is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they&#x27;re really pretty simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells.&quot; Reviews widely praised the sniper mode, graphics, and overall unique gameplay and style.

===Sales and sequel===
The game was both a critical and a commercial success, and Interplay decided to begin work on a sequel immediately. According to the publisher, global sales of &quot;MDK&quot; surpassed 400,000 copies by June 1998. Its sales had reached 500,000 copies by early 2000. Interplay approached Bruty for ideas, but he did not want to go straight into another &quot;MDK&quot; game; &quot;I hadn&#x27;t liked rushing from &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; to its sequel without a creative break, and I felt the game suffered because of that.&quot; In any case, his new development studio, Planet Moon Studios, was already working on &quot;&quot;. Bruty asked Interplay if they would consider waiting until he was finished on &quot;Giants&quot; before beginning on &quot;MDK2&quot;, but they chose to press on with the game without him, handing development over to BioWare.

==TV series==
An &quot;MDK&quot; animated TV series, set to be produced by Mainframe Entertainment, was announced for a 1998 release but was ultimately never aired.

<doc id="980248" wikidata="Q706287" url="?curid=980248" title="Giovanni Maria Nanino">
<text>Giovanni Maria Nanino (also Nanini; 1543 or 1544 – 11 March 1607) was an Italian composer and teacher of the late Renaissance. He was a member of the Roman School of composers, and was the most influential music teacher in Rome in the late 16th century. He was the older brother of composer Giovanni Bernardino Nanino.

== Life ==
Nanino was born in Tivoli, and served as a boy soprano in the cathedral at Viterbo. In the 1560s he probably studied with Palestrina at San Luigi de&#x27; Francesi in Rome; at any rate, he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; there after Palestrina left. In 1577 he joined the papal choir as a tenor, and remained in the choir for the rest of his life, occasionally taking the rotating post of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;.

During the 1590s he was renowned as a teacher; he and his brother established what is thought to be the first Italian-run public music school in Rome and many future composers studied with him and sang in his choirs, including Felice Anerio, Antonio Brunelli, Antonio Cifra and Gregorio Allegri (composer of the famous Miserere).

== Works ==
Nanino&#x27;s output as a composer was not large, but it was distinguished, and his music—especially his madrigals—were extremely popular at the time. Almost no collections of madrigals were published in Rome which did not include at least one contribution by Nanino, often in the most prominent position in the book—even ahead of Palestrina. Stylistically his madrigals are extremely varied. While not as comprehensive as Marenzio, who after all wrote more than 500 madrigals, Nanino&#x27;s examples of the genre vary from the highly serious, angular and contrapuntal, to the lightest canzonette; in expressive intensity he is sometimes compared to Marenzio.

In addition to his famous madrigals, he wrote motets, settings of the Lamentations, canons, and sacred songs. As of 1980, no complete edition of his works had been prepared, and much of his music remained in manuscript.

<text>A playtest is the process by which a game designer tests a new game for bugs and design flaws before releasing it to market. Playtests can be run &quot;open&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, or otherwise, and are very common with board games, collectible card games, puzzle hunts, role-playing games, and video games, for which they have become an established part of the quality control process. An individual involved in testing a game is referred to as a playtester.

An &quot;open&quot; playtest could be considered open to anyone who wishes to join, or it may refer to game designers recruiting testers from outside the design group. Prospective testers usually must complete a survey or provide their contact information in order to be considered for participation. A &quot;closed&quot; playtest is an internal testing process not available to the public. &quot;Beta testing&quot; normally refers to the final stages of testing just before going to market with a product, and is often run semi-open with a limited form of the game in order to find any last-minute problems. With all forms of playtesting it is not unusual for participants to be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, in order to protect the game designer&#x27;s copyrights.

The word &#x27;playtest&#x27; is also commonly used in unofficial situations where a game is being tested by a group of players for their own private use, or to denote a situation where a new strategy or game mechanic is being tested. Playtesting is a part of usability test in the process of game development. 

==Video games==
In the video game industry, playtesting refers specifically to the process of exposing a game in development (or some specific parts of it) to its intended audience, to identify potential design flaws and gather feedback. Playtests are also used to help ensure that a product will be commercially viable upon release, by providing a way for consumers to play the game and provide their opinions. Playtesting should not be confused with quality assurance (QA) testing, in which professional testers look for and report specific software bugs to be fixed by the development team.

The first user research employee in the video game industry was Carol Kantor, who was employed by Atari, Inc. in 1976. Prior to this, the company had evaluated their games primarily via coin-collection data, however playtesting became a core method by which Atari evaluated the commercial viability of new games.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described playtesting as &quot;what everyone says is the least favorite part of the game-building operation&quot;. Steve Meretzky of Infocom said that &quot;the first part of debugging is exciting; it&#x27;s the first feedback. Somebody is actually playing your game. But by the end, you get sick of the little problems. You have spent three months inventing the game, and now you have to spend just as much time cleaning it up&quot;. The requirements for a person to be considered for participation in a playtest vary. Some playtests are open to anyone willing to volunteer, while others specifically target professional gamers and journalists. Some playtests also try to evaluate the game&#x27;s appeal to players with different levels of experience by selecting players with varying exposure to the game&#x27;s genre.

An example of a video game that made extensive use of open playtesting is Minecraft, which was made available for purchase in its pre-alpha stages. This both helped to financially support the game and provide feedback and bug testing during its early stages. Playtesting began even before the game features included multiplayer or the ability to save games. Mojang continues to make use of playtesting with &quot;Minecraft&quot; through weekly development releases, allowing players to experiment with unfinished additions to the game and provide feedback on them.

Some games make use of playtesting with only part of their content, leaving other important sections unexposed to the public. StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm was tested in this manner; its playtest only included the multiplayer portion of the game, while the single-player campaign was not revealed. Heart of the Swarm is also an example of a playtest where average players are not being considered for entry; the initial wave of testers are only being selected from the ranks of professional SCII gamers and from the media.

The open-source video game engine remake OpenRA, which recreates the early Command &amp; Conquer games, publishes playtests to the public during the release process so that a broader range of testers can verify that new features don&#x27;t introduce critical errors such as desync problems in the lockstep protocol and unwanted side effects on the gameplay can be balanced out prior to the next stable release.

Team Fortress 2 uses a method of playtesting whereby players that purchased the game can participate in an open beta. The beta is nearly identical to the actual game itself, but includes items that are on their way to being released in the full game. The purpose of this beta is to test those items before their release, to ensure that they are balanced and fair; in this way, the game is constantly being playtested despite the fact that it has been released.

Valve does not often make use of open playtesting, in keeping with the company&#x27;s tradition of tightly controlling what information they release to the public. However, both Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive were openly playtested, with beta invites being distributed to (and in some cases by) volunteers. Valve also has a general beta signup form on their website; this survey is intended to recruit testers both in the Seattle/Bellevue area and from other locations, to test new games and gaming hardware that Valve is developing.

==Role-playing games==

Due to the nature of pen-and-paper RPGs as opposed to video games, RPG playtests tend to focus more on ensuring that the game&#x27;s mechanics are balanced and that the game flows smoothly in play. It is also more typical to see feedback from players cause game mechanics to be adjusted or altered, as it is usually easier to make such changes with an RPG than it would be with a video game.

An example of a role-playing game that was heavily playtested is the 5th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. For this game, Wizards of the Coast (WotC) used an open playtest with volunteers from their online community to evaluate the game as it was being developed. New playtest packets were distributed to the testers as WotC revised the game. WotC focused heavily on the results of this testing owing to the mixed reactions that the 4th edition rules received, showcasing another advantage of playtesting: helping to ensure that the final product will be a commercial success. The process produced feedback to WotC regarding which aspects of the game needed modifications or redesigns.

While D&amp;D&#x27;s 4th edition did see some playtesting, this was mainly restricted to classes added after the game&#x27;s initial release, such as the monk and the bard. The playtest documents were released through the online &quot;Dragon&quot; Magazine, and were originally available for both subscribers and non-subscribers.

Fantasy Flight Games is running a playtest of the first installment of their new Star Wars RPG. This playtest is similar to &quot;Minecraft&quot;&#x27;s in that the players must purchase the beta rules from Fantasy Flight before playing; the rules are not being released freely to the public. Updates made to the rules are released in PDF format on their website, but there is no word on whether playtesters will get a copy of the actual final draft.

Paizo Publishing ran a completely open playtest through the alpha and beta stages of their Pathfinder Roleplaying Game in 2008 and 2009, releasing the rules as free PDF&#x27;s (and also in print for the beta version) on their web store. Anyone could join the playtest by downloading the documents, running games using them, and posting their feedback on the Paizo message boards. This playtest, which was active for over a year, is the longest-running open playtest in RPG history to date, as well as being one of the largest due to its unrestricted nature.

==Board games==

In the board game industry, playtesting applies both to feedback gathered during the early design process as well as late stage exposure to the target audience by a game&#x27;s publisher. Major types of boardgame testing include local testing — where a designer, developer, or publisher representative moderates the test in person, and remote testing, where groups receive copies of the game or files to assemble their own version.

Wizards of the Coast ran a public playtest of their new Dungeon Command miniatures game. In this case, they used the feedback generated on the rules to improve the game but also used feedback on the playtest itself to improve logistics on the D&amp;D Next playtest.

Steve Jackson Games uses Munchkin players from the area around their offices to test new cards and expansions, as well as distributing playtest packages at conventions. According to the SJG website, this is done &quot;so we [the developers] can observe carefully which cards work well, which jokes aren&#x27;t as funny as we thought, and so on.&quot;

==Other games==

The playtest concept has been carried over into a full-fledged sport. Jim Foster, inventor and founder of the Arena Football League, tested his concept of indoor football in a special one-time game in 1986. This game was organized at the behest of NBC in order to test the viability of the game&#x27;s concept. The Rockford Metros and the Chicago Politicians played the game in Rockford, Illinois. The test proved successful, and four teams began the league&#x27;s first season the following year.

==Disadvantages==

The most dangerous risks with playtesting is that the playtest version of the game could be released over the internet, particularly if it is a video game or something presented in an electronic format. There are ways to prevent this; for example, requiring all players to log-on to the game&#x27;s servers before it will launch, or implementing other forms of DRM.

Even if the game itself is not leaked, details regarding its gameplay still may be. It is likely that over the course of an open playtest, even one where testers signed NDAs, that some details will be leaked onto the web. This is a major risk for companies wishing to preserve secrecy, particularly in nations where there are no way to prevent leaks from occurring.

<text>Perekop (Ukrainian &amp; Russian: Перекоп; ; ) is a village located on the Perekop Isthmus connecting the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian mainland. It is known for the Or Qapi fortress, which served as the gateway to Crimea. The village currently is part of Armiansk Municipality. Population: 

==Name==
The original name was of the Greek settlement of &quot;Taphros&quot; () which means a dug-out locality. The people were called Taphrians ()

Thereafter it was known by the equivalent name of &quot;Or Qapı&quot; in the Crimean Tatar language meaning &quot;Or&quot; - trench and &quot;Qapı&quot; - gate. In the Middle Ages, Perekop was known as Tuzla. Subsequently, it was known as &quot;Perekop&quot; in the Slavic languages, which literally means an over-dug locality.

==History==
Due to its key position, Perekop has endured many sieges.

During the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739), Russian field marshal Burkhard Christoph von Munnich successfully stormed the fortifications on June 17, 1736 and left the Tatar fortress in ruins. This was a serious, if not mortal, blow to the independence of the Crimean Khanate.

The town was virtually wiped out during the Siege of Perekop by the Red Army in 1920. The siege was a key episode of the Russian Civil War. The success of the Bolsheviks allowed them to oust Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Army from the Crimea. Twelve years later, the Soviets founded the new town of Krasnoperekopsk to the south.

During World War II, Perekop was occupied by the German Army from September 27, 1941 to November 1, 1943. The capture of Perekop (by both the Wehrmacht in 1941 and the Red Army in 1943) was used to cut off Crimea from Ukraine.

<doc id="980257" wikidata="Q165258" url="?curid=980257" title="Diospyros">
<text>Diospyros is a genus of over 700 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. The majority are native to the tropics, with only a few species extending into temperate regions. Individual species valued for their hard, heavy, dark timber, are commonly known as [[ebony]] trees, while others are valued for their fruit and known as [[persimmon]] trees. Some are useful as ornamentals and many are of local ecological importance. Species of this genus are generally dioecious, with separate male and female plants.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The generic name &quot;Diospyros&quot; comes from a Latin name for the Caucasian persimmon (&quot;D. lotus&quot;), derived from the Greek διόσπυρος : dióspyros, from &quot;diós&quot; () and &quot;pyrós&quot; (). The Greek name literally means &quot;Zeus&#x27;s wheat&quot; but more generally intends &quot;divine food&quot; or &quot;divine fruit&quot;.

The genus is a large one and the number of species has been estimated variously, depending on the date of the source. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, list has over 1000 entries, including synonyms and items of low confidence. Over 700 species are marked as being assigned with high confidence.

The oldest fossils of the genus date to the Eocene, which indicate by that time &quot;Diospyros&quot; was widely distributed over the Northern Hemisphere.

==Chemotaxonomy==

The leaves of &quot;Diospyros blancoi&quot; have been shown to contain isoarborinol methyl ether (also called cylindrin) and fatty esters of α- and β-amyrin. Both isoarborinol methyl ether and the amyrin mixture demonstrated antimicrobial activity against &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Trichophyton interdigitale&quot;. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have also been shown for the isolated amyrin mixture.

==Ecology==
&quot;Diospyros&quot; species are important and conspicuous trees in many of their native ecosystems, such as lowland dry forests of the former Maui Nui in Hawaii, Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests, Khathiar–Gir dry deciduous forests, Louisiade Archipelago rain forests, Madagascar lowland forests, Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests, New Caledonian sclerophytic vegetation, New Guinea mangroves or South Western Ghats montane rain forests. 

The green fruits are avoided by most herbivores, perhaps because they are rich in tannins. When ripe, they are eagerly eaten by many animals however, such as (in East Africa) the rare Aders&#x27; duiker (&quot;Cephalophus adersi&quot;). The foliage is used as food by the larvae of numerous Lepidoptera species:

Arctiidae:
* &quot;Eupseudosoma aberrans&quot;
* &quot;Eupseudosoma involutum&quot; (snowy eupseudosoma)
* &quot;Hypercompe indecisa&quot;
Geometridae:
* &quot;Gymnoscelis rufifasciata&quot; (double-striped pug) – recorded on persimmons
Limacodidae:
* &quot;Monema flavescens&quot;
Lycaenidae:
* &quot;Neopithecops zalmora&quot; (Quaker)
Nymphalidae:
* &quot;Charaxes khasianus&quot; (Kihansi charaxes) – recorded on &quot;D. natalensis&quot;
* &quot;Dophla evelina&quot; (redspot duke) – recorded on &quot;D. candolleana&quot;
Saturniidae:
* &quot;Actias luna&quot; (Luna moth) – recorded on persimmons
* &quot;Callosamia promethea&quot; (promethea silkmoth) – recorded on persimmons
* &quot;Citheronia regalis&quot; (regal moth) – recorded on American persimmon (&quot;D. virginiana&quot;)
Tortricidae:
* &quot;&quot;Cnephasia&quot; jactatana&quot; (black-lyre leafroller moth)

An economically significant plant pathogen infecting many &quot;Diospyros&quot; species – &quot;D. hispida&quot;, kaki persimmon (&quot;D. kaki&quot;), date-plum (&quot;D. lotus&quot;), Texas persimmon (&quot;D. texana&quot;), Coromandel ebony (&quot;D. melanoxylon&quot;) and probably others – is the sac fungus &quot;Pseudocercospora kaki&quot;, which causes a leaf spot disease.

==Use by humans==

The genus includes several plants of commercial importance, either for their edible fruit (persimmons) or for their timber (ebony). The latter are divided into two groups in trade: the pure black ebony (notably from &quot;D. ebenum&quot;, but also several other species), and the striped ebony or calamander wood (from &quot;D. celebica&quot;, &quot;D. mun&quot; and others). Most species in the genus produce little to none of this black ebony-type wood; their hard timber (e.g. of American persimmon, &quot;D. virginiana&quot;) may still be used on a more limited basis.

Leaves of the Coromandel ebony (&quot;D. melanoxylon&quot;) are used to roll South Asian beedi cigarettes. Several species are used in herbalism, and &quot;D. leucomelas&quot; yields the versatile medical compound betulinic acid. Extracts from &quot;Diospyros&quot; plants have also been proposed as novel anti-viral treatment. Though bees do not play a key role as pollinators, in plantations &quot;Diospyros&quot; may be of some use as honey plants. &quot;D. mollis&quot;, locally known as &quot;mặc nưa&quot;, is used in Vietnam to dye the famous black &quot;lãnh Mỹ A&quot; silk of Tân Châu district.

The reverence of these trees in their native range is reflected by their use as floral emblems. In Indonesia, &quot;D. celebica&quot; (Makassar ebony, known locally as &quot;eboni&quot;) is the provincial tree of Central Sulawesi, while ajan kelicung (&quot;D. macrophylla&quot;) is that of West Nusa Tenggara. The emblem of the Japanese island of Ishigaki is the &quot;Yaeyama kokutan&quot; (&quot;D. ferrea&quot;). The Gold apple (&quot;D. decandra&quot;), called &quot;Trái thị&quot; in Vietnamese, is a tree in the Tấm Cám fable. It is also the provincial tree of Chanthaburi as well as Nakhon Pathom Provinces in Thailand, while the black-and-white ebony (&quot;D. malabarica&quot;) is that of Ang Thong Province. The name of the Thai district Amphoe Tha Tako, literally means &quot;District of the &quot;Diospyros&quot; pier&quot;, the latter being a popular local gathering spot.

<text>The British Rail Class 411 (4CEP) electric multiple units were built at Eastleigh works from 1956–63 for the newly electrified main lines in Kent. These units, which used the British Railways Mark 1 bodyshell, were based on the earlier Southern Railway 4 COR design, built in 1937. Variants of the class 411 design included the class 410 and class 412 4 BEP units, which contained a buffet car in place of a standard trailer. They were later used on services in Sussex and Hampshire; following the privatisation of British Rail in 1995, the units were used by the Connex South Central, Connex South Eastern and South West Trains franchises. They were replaced by Juniper, Desiro, and Electrostar units. The fleet&#x27;s lifespan was 49 years. These units are the longest-lived BR Mark 1 EMUs.

== Description ==
A total of 133 units were built, as two different types. The majority of units were &#x27;standard&#x27; passenger-only units, complemented by units containing a buffet car.

=== Standard units ===
The standard units contained passenger seating only, and formed the backbone of the new fleet. 111 units were built in several batches, initially numbered in the range 7101-7211. Units 7101-7104 were the prototype units, and were followed by &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units (7105-7153) and subsequently &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; units (7154-7211).

Units were formed of two outer driving motors cars with 2nd class (later Standard Class) seating in open saloons, sandwiching two intermediate trailer cars – one a corridor second and the other a First/Second corridor composite.

=== 4 BEP units ===
The 4 BEP units were similar to the standard units, but contained a buffet car in place of the second class open trailer. The buffet trailer had a dining room, a large kitchen pantry, and a buffet counter with some seats.

22 units were built, initially numbered in the range 7001-7022. The first two units (7001-7002) were prototypes, and were followed by &#x27;Phase 1&#x27; units (7003-7012) and &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; (7013-7022).

The 4 BEP fleet were classified as Class 410 by British Rail under the new computer numbering system introduced in 1968.

== Vehicle numbering ==
The numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.
== Refurbishment ==

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, British Rail recognised that the 4 CEP fleet was in need of refurbishment. This was carried out at BR&#x27;s Swindon Works. Refurbishment included moving the guard&#x27;s compartment from both the motor cars to one of the intermediate trailers. Many of the 4BEP fleet were converted to standard units, since the requirement for buffet cars had declined.

The first refurbished unit was no. 7153, which was later renumbered to 1500. This unit was experimentally refurbished in 1975 at Eastleigh Works. Following evaluation, the contract for the refurbishment of the rest of the fleet was awarded to BR&#x27;s Swindon Works. At the same time, units were renumbered from their original sequence into the later BR standard system reflecting TOPS class and sub-class, though in Southern Region style, only the last four digits were carried - so for example 411 501 was abbreviated to 1501. Units were renumbered in order of refurbishment, not reflecting their original numerical order. Subsequent refurbished standard units were renumbered in the range 1501–1621, and reclassified as Class 411/5. Only seven 4 BEP units were retained and refurbished, being renumbered in the range 2301–2307, and reclassified as Class 412/3. The remaining 4BEP units were converted into 4CEP units by replacing the buffet car with a standard trailer converted from conventional locomotive-hauled coaching stock. Refurbished buffet cars had a small dining room, while a second class room, seating 24, took the place of the buffet.

=== 4 TEP units ===
Between 1983 and 1986, several 4 Big units required extensive refurbishment. To cover their workings, four temporary 4 TEP units were created, formed of three carriages from a refurbished CEP unit, with an unrefurbished buffet car from a BEP unit. The units were renumbered in the range 2701–2704. They were based at Brighton depot and operated mostly on the London to line. The units were disbanded by 1986, once the refurbishment programme was complete, and were reformed as standard 4 CEP units. The unrefurbished buffet carriages were scrapped.

Unit formation are given below:
== Final operations ==
After rail privatisation in the mid-1990s, the different divisions of British Rail were divided up into different franchises. The three former SR division; South-Eastern, South Central and South-Western; all operated 4 CEP units, and are dealt with separately here.

=== Connex South Central ===
The South Central (SC) division, operated as Connex South Central, briefly operated 4 CEP units in the period 1995–1998. Three standard units were converted to Class 411/6 by fitting them with high-speed Mk.6 motor bogies. These units were renumbered into the series 1697–1699. They were chiefly employed on London Bridge to Brighton express services. However, as the units were non-standard in the SC fleet, they were withdrawn and transferred to South West Trains.

=== South Eastern Trains ===

The South Eastern (SE) division inherited the largest fleet of 4 CEP units. The franchise was originally operated by Connex South Eastern, but after Connex lost the franchise it became South Eastern Trains. In 1996, when the franchise was awarded, a fleet of 85 standard units were in traffic. Many of these were quickly withdrawn from traffic, or transferred to the SW division. In early 1999, five units were converted to Class 411/9 3CEP units, with the removal of the second class open trailer. These removed trailers had not had so much work carried out on them at the time of refurbishment (as they were basically unchanged apart from cosmetic appearance and installation of hopper windows) and many had become severely corroded. This was necessary, as some stations could only accommodate 11 carriages. A further 13 units were later converted. The 3 CEP units were renumbered into the series 1101–1118.

The Connex fleet contained two &#x27;celebrity&#x27; units. The first, no. 1592, was repainted by staff at Ramsgate depot into its original Green livery, to commemorate the final months in traffic for these units. The second, no. 1602, was the only 4 CEP unit repainted into Connex livery, after it received derailment damage outside London Bridge station, and had to be repaired at Eastleigh works. Both of these units were popular with railtours and excursion trains.

Withdrawal of units started in 1999, after they were replaced by new Class 375 &#x27;Electrostar&#x27; units. The original aim was to totally replace the 4 CEP fleet by 2000. However, poor reliability of the new units saw the 4 CEP&#x27;s retained beyond this date. By the end of 2002, the fleet was again being reduced, with many standard units being sent to Immingham for scrap. The 3 CEP units were all withdrawn by March 2003, as units in traffic beyond this date had to be fitted with TPWS equipment. In the event, only seven units, nos. 1562, 1590, 1592, 1593, 1594, 1602 and 1615 were retained.

By the beginning of 2004, the seven units were withdrawn as they were due overhaul. They were replaced with units cascaded from South West Trains, which included the three Class 411/6 units. However, these units were themselves slowly retired, and it was expected the final units would have been withdrawn from service before the end of 2004. However, the Class 411/6 units were eventually withdrawn in July 2005, following the introduction of refurbished Class 465/9 &quot;Networkers&quot;. Units 1697 and 1699 were sent for scrap, but 1698 was retained for working railtours. Due to a unit shortage It was later reinstated in August 2005, and remained in traffic until late September. It was one of three units to work a Ramsgate to Weymouth railtour, the others being 4 Cig 1866 and 4Vep 3545. Following this, it was quickly despatched for scrap.

=== South West Trains ===

The South West (SW) division franchise was won by the Stagecoach Group and was operated as South West Trains (SWT). SWT did not inherit any standard 4 CEP units, but it did operate the seven 4 BEP units. However, in 1996, a shortage of trains led to SWT hiring two sets (nos. 1568 and 1589) on a short-term lease. These units were quickly followed by more, until by 1998, SWT had a fleet of 29 standard 4 CEP units. These were gradually overhauled, and were employed on a range of duties, including services to Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth. Additionally, units commonly worked services on the Lymington branch.

The fleet stayed reasonably static until 2002, when SWT reformed several sets. The buffet cars from the 4 BEP units were inserted into seven standard units, which were renumbered 2321–2327 (reclassified as Class 412/2). The displaced carriages were inserted into the 4 BEP units, which were renumbered 2311–2317 (reclassified as Class 412/1). The reason behind this was that the 4 BEP units had faster acceleration, and the buffet cars were no longer used. Therefore, the reformations allowed a higher seating capacity in the faster units.

By 2003, SWT had ordered new trains, to replace all its slam door trains. These were designated Class 444 for express trains and Class 450 for suburban trains. The first units to be replaced were the units in the 232x series, which were due for early withdrawal. Of the seven sets, one, set no. 2323, was withdrawn in 2002 due to fire damage, but was later converted back to a standard unit. Another, set no. 2326, was reduced to a 3 CEP, for operating the &quot;Lymington Flyer&quot; service on the Lymington branch, and was renumbered 1199. The remaining five units lasted until December 2003, when they were withdrawn. One, set no. 2325 was preserved, whilst the rest were scrapped.
The standard units lasted until early 2004, when they were either withdrawn and scrapped, or transferred to South Eastern Trains. One of the 4 BEP units, no. 2314, was converted into a 3CEP to replace no. 1199, and was renumbered 1198. Of the remaining six 4 BEP units, four were withdrawn in October 2004, leaving just two units remaining in traffic into 2005. The 3 CEP unit, no. 1198, was withdrawn at the end of December 2004, and was preserved by the EMU Preservation Society on the Dartmoor Railway before moving in 2008 to the Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway and then in 2013 to the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway. A replacement came in the form of 3Cig unit no. 1499. The final two 4 BEP units 2311 and 2315, soldiered on in traffic until withdrawal in March 2005. They were both later preserved at the Eden Valley Railway as 4CEPs.

== Further use and departmental units ==
Over the years, several unit have seen further use as departmental units. These are listed below:
*7102 – Converted to Tractor Unit 932080. Scrapped in 1996
*1500 – Converted to Tractor Unit 932081. Scrapped in 1996
*1505 – Converted to Route-learning Unit 930082 for use by Southern, including removal of end-gangways. Later converted to static training unit at Selhurst depot. Sent for scrap in September 2005.
*1512 – Used as a 3-car Tractor Unit by South West Trains at Bournemouth depot. Scrapped in June 2005 after being replaced by a Class 73 electro-diesel locomotive.
*1545 – Converted to 3 car test unit 932545 and exported to Sweden. Converted to AC Overhead Line and DC Dual Voltage and was a test bed for IGBT and Adtranz Traction Package. Scrapped there in 2002.
*1620 – Converted to test unit 932620 for central door locking trials. Then used for paint trials at Eastleigh Works. Scrapped in November 2005.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On 4 January 1969, units 7181 and 7117 formed a passenger train that overran a signal in thick fog and ran into the rear of a parcels train near , Kent. As a consequence, three cars of unit 7181 were written off.
*On 15 July 1970, unit 7015 collided with a lorry on an occupation crossing between and , Kent due to errors by the crossing keeper. The driver of the lorry and the guard of the train were killed.
*On 28 January 1993, unit 1521 overran the buffers at Ramsgate Depot, with one driving carriage left perched precariously above houses.

== Preservation ==
Four complete units have been saved for preservation.
*4 BEP unit no. 2325 (containing 3 coaches of ex 1537, ex-7105) has been preserved by the EPB Preservation Group, is currently split in different locations with the centre cars being at the Epping Ongar Railway and the driving ends at Eastleigh Works. This set was the first of the production units to be built, and it is hoped to restore it to its original condition. in January 2014, the two motor coaches were moved by road and rail to Eastleigh Works for this to begin. As of September 2016 one driving end is stripped and the other is in store.
*4 BEP unit no. 2304 has been preserved by the EMU Preservation Society on the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway. It was moved in May 2008 from the Dartmoor Railway to the Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway until August 2013, immediately prior to that railway&#x27;s closure pending re-organisation. This unit was converted from former 4 BEP unit 1198 (ex-2314, ex-2304, ex-7175) for use on the Lymington Branch Line. In 2019 the unit was renumbered to 2304 and a former BEP buffet coach 69345 was purchased to be attached to the unit.
*4 BEP units nos. 2311 and 2315 (which contains the other coach of 1537, ex-7105) are preserved on the Eden Valley Railway. These were the final two 4BEP units in service with South West Trains.
*Both driving motor coaches from unit no. 1589 (ex-7178) were preserved on the Dartmoor Railway, but was scrapped in September 2021. Its TBC carriage can be found at Snibston Discovery Park in Leicestershire, and its TSO carriage was in now disbanded Cig 1393, at the Whitwell &amp; Reepham railway station. 
*The TBC 70345 from unit no. 1500 (ex-7153), which was also in 1547, is currently preserved In a Private Garden in Sutton Bridge.

The full list is shown below. Complete units are highlighted:

<text>Henry Gerald Beenders (June 2, 1916 – October 27, 2003) was a Dutch-American professional basketball player.

==Early life==
Beenders was born in Haarlem, Netherlands, and migrated to the United States at age eight. He lived in Brooklyn, New York, and Scotch Plains, New Jersey, before moving to Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, in the late 1960s. He attended North Plainfield High School in North Plainfield, New Jersey.

==Playing career==
Beenders played the center position on the 1941 NIT champion Long Island University team, and was team captain during the 1941–42 season under Hall of Fame coach Clair Bee. He served with the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Beenders was one of the first international basketball players in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the National Basketball Association (NBA). Beenders averaged 12.3 points in his rookie season with Providence, which was 13th best in the league that season. He played for Providence the following season until he was sold to the Philadelphia Warriors on January 15, 1948. On May 1, 1948, Beenders was traded to the Boston Celtics with Chick Halbert for Ed Sadowski.

==Later life==
After ending his basketball career, Beenders worked as an international sales representative for a clothing exporting company in New York City for 35 years. He was 87 when he died at the Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, New Jersey.

<text>Delvin () is a village in County Westmeath, Ireland; it is located on the N52 road at a junction with the N51 to Navan. The town is from Mullingar (along the N52).

The word Delvin comes from Delbhna. That tribe settled in what is present-day Delvin, along with a branch of the Soghain, in &quot;Tricha céd na Delbna Móire agus na Sogan&quot;.

==Delvin Castle and Clonyn Castle==

Delvin Castle (or Nugent Castle), now a ruin, was built in 1181 by Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath for his brother-in-law, Gilbert de Nugent. De Nugent came to Ireland with de Lacy in 1171 and settled on some land in Delvin. De Nugent was granted the title Baron of Delvin within the Lordship of Meath, a title now held by the Earl of Westmeath. The ruins of Nugent Castle (not publicly accessible) remain near the centre of the town.

A second castle was built several centuries later, hundreds of metres from the centre of the Delvin settlement of that time. This building, known as Clonyn Castle, is situated south of Delvin between the N52 and the Collinstown road. Built in the mid-19th century, by Lord and Lady Greville Nugent, it was sold by the Nugent family in 1922. Changing hands several times during the 20th century, it is now a private residence.

==Amenities==
The 18-hole Delvin Castle Golf Club is located near the town.

Between the 2002 and 2016 census, the population of the town more than doubled from 270 to 740 people. In addition to other developments, plans were unveiled for the provision of a new sports and leisure facility within the village To date, a walking track, floodlit football pitch and basic changing facilities have been provided on site.

== Education ==
National (primary) schools in the area include St. Patrick&#x27;s (Crowenstown), St. Tola&#x27;s (Hiskinstown), and St. Ernan&#x27;s National Schools.

==People==

* Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet, landowner and father of T. E. Lawrence, was brought up at a large manor house near Delvin
* Laurence Ginnell, nationalist politician, was also from Delvin
* Brinsley MacNamara, writer and Delvin native, set the 1918 novel &quot;Valley of the Squinting Windows&quot; in Delvin (under the fictitious name of &quot;Garradrimna&quot;)
* Mary McEvoy, actress who played Biddy Byrne in &quot;Glenroe&quot; is from Delvin

<doc id="980282" wikidata="Q3642742" url="?curid=980282" title="Gas lift">
<text>A gas lift or bubble pump is a type of pump that can raise fluid between elevations by introducing gas bubbles into a vertical outlet tube; as the bubbles rise within the tube they cause a drop in the hydrostatic pressure behind them, causing the fluid to be pulled up. Gas lifts are commonly used as artificial lifts for water or oil, using compressed air or water vapor.

Gas lifts have been used for a variety of applications: 
*Coffee percolators and electric drip coffeemakers use vaporized water to lift hot water
*Airlift pumps use compressed air to lift water
*Pulser pumps use a subterranean air chamber to lift underground water
*Suction dredges use a variety of the gas lift called an &quot;airlift pump&quot; to vacuum mud, sand and debris
*Mist lifts use vaporized water to draw seawater in ocean thermal energy conversion systems

==Petroleum industry uses==
In the United States, gas lift is used in 10% of the oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure to produce the well. In the petroleum industry, the process involves injecting gas through the tubing-casing annulus. Injected gas aerates the fluid to reduce its density; the formation pressure is then able to lift the oil column and forces the fluid out of the wellbore. Gas may be injected continuously or intermittently, depending on the producing characteristics of the well and the arrangement of the gas-lift equipment.

The amount of gas to be injected to maximize oil production varies based on well conditions and geometries. Too much or too little injected gas will result in less than maximum production. Generally, the optimal amount of injected gas is determined by well tests, where the rate of injection is varied and liquid production (oil and perhaps water) is measured. Alternatively, mathematical models can be used to estimate the optimum gas injection rate. Such models offer significant economic benefit, since they allow one to simulate the performance of an actual or planned gas-lifted well using a digital replica of the well.

Although the gas is recovered from the oil at a later separation stage, the process requires energy to drive a compressor to raise the pressure of the gas to a level where it can be re-injected.

The gas-lift mandrel is a device installed in the tubing string of a gas-lift well onto which or into which a gas-lift valve is fitted. There are two common types of mandrels. In a conventional gas-lift mandrel, a gas-lift valve is installed as the tubing is placed in the well. Thus, to replace or repair the valve, the tubing string must be pulled. In the side-pocket mandrel, however, the valve is installed and removed by wireline while the mandrel is still in the well, eliminating the need to pull the tubing to repair or replace the valve.

A gas-lift valve is a device installed on (or in) a gas-lift mandrel, which in turn is put on the production tubing of a gas-lift well. Tubing and casing pressures cause the valve to open and close, thus allowing gas to be injected into the fluid in the tubing to cause the fluid to rise to the surface. In the lexicon of the industry, gas-lift mandrels are said to be &quot;tubing retrievable&quot; wherein they are deployed and retrieved attached to the production tubing. See gas-lift mandrel.

Gas lift operation can be optimized in different ways. The newest way is using risk-optimization which considers all aspects for gas lift allocation.

==History==
Invented by Norman J. Rees and Albert W Zeuthen in 1956, Current Assignee ExxonMobil Oil Corp. Air lift uses compressed air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It is also found in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve at the bottom of the string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using compressed air, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the pressurized bellows valve that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.

<text>Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is a former officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He argued that he was subjected to unfair dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that to do so would breach state security.

Tomlinson was imprisoned under the Official Secrets Act 1989 in 1997 after he gave a synopsis of a proposed book detailing his career with MI6 to an Australian publisher. He served six months of a twelve-month sentence before being paroled, after which he fled Britain. The book, named &quot;The Big Breach,&quot; was published in 2001 and was subsequently serialised by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The book detailed various aspects of MI6 operations, alleging that it employed a mole in the German Bundesbank and that it held a &quot;licence to kill&quot;, the latter later confirmed by the head of MI6 at a public hearing.

Tomlinson then attempted to assist Mohamed al-Fayed in his privately funded investigation into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and al-Fayed&#x27;s son Dodi. Tomlinson claimed that MI6 had considered assassinating Slobodan Milošević, the president of Serbia, by staging a car crash using a powerful strobe light to blind the driver, and suggested that Diana and Dodi might have been killed by MI6 in the same way. MI6 confirmed that plans of that nature had been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected by management.

In 2009 MI6 apologised for its treatment of Tomlinson, dropped all threat of charges and agreed to unfreeze royalties on his book. Staff at MI6 have been allowed employment tribunals since 2000, and have been able to unionise since 2008.

==Early life==
Richard John Charles Tomlinson was born in Hamilton, New Zealand, and raised in the nearby town of Ngāruawāhia. He was the middle child in a family of three brothers. His father came from a Lancashire farming family and he worked for the Ministry of Agriculture, and had met his wife whilst studying agriculture at Newcastle University. The family moved to the village of Armathwaite in Cumbria, England, in 1968. The young Tomlinson won a scholarship for the independent Barnard Castle School in County Durham, where he was a contemporary of Rory Underwood and Rob Andrew, who went on to become England rugby internationals. He excelled at mathematics and physics, and won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1981.

His fellow student, historian Andrew Roberts, remembers Tomlinson as &quot;a bright and charming undergraduate, popular with the boys for his drinking and sporting prowess, and with the girls for his dark good looks.&quot; His friends included Gideon Rachman, who wrote him a reference after his tutor refused to do so. Tomlinson completed flying training with Cambridge University Air Squadron and won a Half Blue for Modern Pentathlon. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a starred First Class honours degree in aeronautical engineering in 1984, and was approached by MI6 shortly afterwards, whose offer he turned down. Following his graduation he took examinations to join the Royal Navy as a Fleet Air Arm Officer, but he failed the medical examination due to childhood asthma. Instead he applied for and was awarded a Kennedy Scholarship, which allowed him to study technology policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with full funding during 1986–7. Following this, he was awarded a prize from the Rotary Foundation, allowing him to study in the country of his choice for a year. Consequently, he enrolled in a political science course at the University of Buenos Aires, where he became fluent in the Spanish language. He continued to pursue his aeronautical interests and qualified as a glider pilot with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. During 1988–9, Tomlinson worked in Mayfair, London, for management consultancy company Booz Allen Hamilton.

==Military and MI6 service==

Finding his desk job unsatisfying, Tomlinson joined the Territorial Army in September 1989 and, after passing selection, served as a reservist with the SAS in the Artists Rifles, and then 23 SAS, qualifying as a military parachutist and radio operator. He represented Britain in the 1990 Camel Trophy, competing in Siberia, and crossed the Sahara desert solo on a motorcycle. He enjoyed the experience, subsequently applied to join MI6, and officially joined the Service on 23 September 1991. He completed his training with MI6 and claims he was the best recruit on his course, being awarded the rarely given &quot;Box 1&quot; attribute by his instructing officers including Nicholas Langman.

Tomlinson worked in the &quot;SOV/OPS&quot; department, operating during the ending phases of the Cold War against the Soviet Union. He was posted to a diplomatic role in Moscow, and was one of the agents responsible for the retrieval of the Mitrokhin Archive in 1992. From March 1992 until September 1993, he worked in the Eastern European Controllerate of MI6 under the staff designation of UKA/7. Whilst working there, it was discovered that the Conservative Party had been receiving donations from Serbian supporters. In November 1993, he joined the Balkans Controllerate, and was posted to Sarajevo for six months as the MI6 representative in Bosnia during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. There he was a &quot;targeting officer&quot;, with a mission to identify potential informants and gather intelligence. A soldier who escorted Tomlinson to Bosnia described him as a &quot;liability&quot;, a &quot;sulk&quot; and &quot;totally unprofessional&quot;, although Tomlinson has disputed this.

From 1994 to 1995, Tomlinson worked in the operational counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons in order to gain intelligence on Iran&#x27;s military programme. Tomlinson&#x27;s description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.

On 13 May 1994, Tomlinson resigned from MI6, suggesting in his letter of resignation that he had lost the motivation for a career with the organisation. He was later permitted to rescind his resignation.

MI6 dismissed him on 22 May 1995 as he came to the end of his extended probationary period. Tomlinson&#x27;s probationary period had been extended over the standard six-month duration due to his senior line manager&#x27;s doubts about his personality. Tomlinson claimed that he had become suicidally depressed following the death of his long-term girlfriend from cancer and that he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress after witnessing violence against a civilian during the siege of Sarajevo, and that MI6 had been ill-equipped to handle his condition. MI6 argued that he was dismissed for &quot;not being a team player, lacking motivation and having a short-term interest in the service&quot;, but later conceded that he had experienced a &quot;personality clash&quot; with his senior line manager. Another reason given for his dismissal was for &quot;going on frolics on his own&quot;. Tomlinson claims that no formal reason for his dismissal was ever given, and that he was mid-assignment when he suddenly found himself barred from entering MI6 headquarters. Friends suggested that he was sacked after he complained about MI6&#x27;s &quot;unethical&quot; tactics. Tomlinson argued that his supervisors had unfairly disregarded his personal circumstances. Tomlinson disputed the reasons for and legality of his dismissal and attempted to take MI6 before an employment tribunal. However, MI6 obtained a public-interest immunity certificate from the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. Having no further legal recourse to appeal against his dismissal, Tomlinson left the United Kingdom, and pursued his arguments against MI6 by publishing articles in the international press protesting his treatment, whilst working on a book detailing his career in the Service.

In 1998, the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee recommended that MI6 should be subject to UK employment law. Since 2000, employees of MI6 have had the same employment rights as other British citizens, including written contracts and access to employment tribunals. However, MI6 refused to allow these procedures to be applied retroactively to Tomlinson&#x27;s case. MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining another PII certificate since the Tomlinson case.

==&quot;The Big Breach&quot;==

Tomlinson moved to the Costa del Sol in Spain for 18 months from early 1996. Realising that a disgruntled former spy could be problematic for the agency, the aide-de-camp to the head of MI6 was enlisted to attempt to appease Tomlinson in February 1997. He offered him a £15,000 loan and a marketing job with Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Formula One racing team, in return for a promise of silence. Tomlinson accepted the offer (he claims under duress) but retained the job for only a few months before he emigrated to Australia, where his younger brother lived.

Tomlinson returned to Britain, and in October 1997 was arrested and accused of breaking the Official Secrets Act 1989, after delivering a seven-page synopsis of &quot;The Big Breach&quot; to the Australian office of Transworld, a British publisher. On 18 December 1997 he was sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty.

In August 1998, after serving six months in prison and four months on probation, Tomlinson left the UK to live in exile. He set about completing &quot;The Big Breach&quot;, which was published in 2001 in Russia. The book alleged that MI6 had infiltrated the German Bundesbank with a mole, and that the Service had a special means of writing in invisible ink. Other revelations were already public knowledge, such as that MI6 recruits are trained at Fort Monckton in Hampshire, and that agents in the field often use the cover of being a journalist.

After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales ruled in his favour, the book was made available in the UK. Following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, on the grounds that the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of &quot;The Big Breach&quot;, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation&#x27;s previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. It still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson has been able to travel freely to the UK.

===Reception===
&quot;The Economist&quot; criticised the &quot;mess&quot; that MI6 had made in failing to handle the Tomlinson case properly: &quot;Recruiting Mr Tomlinson looks like a bad mistake, and his sacking seems to have been clumsily handled.&quot; The newspaper&#x27;s reviewer complained: &quot;there is little useful information in this breathless, whingeing and ill-written volume that a diligent reader of books about spying would not know already.&quot;

Jimmy Burns, reviewing the book for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, speculated that it was plausible that &quot;MI6&#x27;s senior management realised they had made a terrible mistake in recruiting someone who thought that espionage was just one big adventure.&quot; He concluded, however, that the book &quot;left me with the feeling that the spooks in Whitehall could have avoided a great deal of adverse publicity by agreeing to Tomlinson&#x27;s original proposal: an employment tribunal held &quot;in camera&quot;.&quot;

Former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela reacted angrily to Tomlinson&#x27;s accusation in the book that he had a long-standing relationship with MI6, describing it as a &quot;disgraceful fabrication&quot;. Tomlinson removed the references to Mandela in the British edition of the book, conceding that Mandela was probably unaware that the officials with whom he spoke were affiliated with MI6.

==Other alleged breaches and assertions==

===List of MI6 agents===
In May 1999, a list of 116 alleged MI6 agents was sent to the LaRouche movement&#x27;s publication &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, a weekly magazine which published it online. Its names included Andrew Fulton, who had recently retired, Christopher Steele, David Spedding and Richard Dearlove. MI6 biographer Stephen Dorril explained that most of the names were &quot;light-cover&quot; sources who worked out of embassies or missions posing as diplomats. Dorril argued, &quot;it is well known that rival intelligence networks know who these people are and accept them.&quot; MI6 claimed that Tomlinson had originated the list, which was something he had previously threatened to do, although he denied responsibility for it, and MI6 were unable to substantiate their accusation.

Tomlinson wrote, &quot;If MI6 had set out to produce a list that caused me the maximum incrimination, but caused them the minimum damage, they could not have done a better job.&quot; He also said, &quot;It mystifies me why MI6 gave the list credibility. If they were really worried about the safety of their agents they could have denied it.&quot; After &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper called Tomlinson a &quot;traitor&quot; and published his email address, he received death threats, and fearing for his life, went into hiding for a time. Government officials later conceded that the list did not originate from Tomlinson.

===Diana, Princess of Wales===
During 2008, Tomlinson was a witness for the inquest into the deaths of the Princess of Wales and Dodi al Fayed. He had suggested that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death and that her driver on the night she died, Henri Paul, had been an MI6 informant, and that her death resembled plans he saw during 1992 for the assassination of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, using a bright light to cause a traffic accident.

At the Coroner&#x27;s Inquest into the death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, speaking by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he &quot;could not remember specifically&quot; whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it &quot;would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not think the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either&quot;. He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.

==Post-MI6 activities==
In August 1998, Tomlinson left the United Kingdom for France, and shortly afterwards moved to New Zealand. Later that month he was deported from the United States, and in October 1998 he moved to Switzerland, before being expelled in June 1999 after the Swiss authorities described his presence there as &quot;undesirable&quot;. He moved to Germany until he was hounded out by officials, whereupon he moved to Italy. In 2001 he left Rimini in Italy, where he had been working as a waiter and a snowboarding instructor, for the south of France near Cannes where he worked as a yacht broker for BCR Yachts. From 2006 to 2007, Tomlinson maintained a series of blogs detailing his treatment. His Riviera home was raided by police in 2006.

In 2007, government lawyers decided not to prosecute him for publishing &quot;The Big Breach&quot;. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was no real prospect of conviction in a jury trial, which would reveal &quot;sensitive matters&quot;. In 2009, MI6 agreed to allow Tomlinson to return to Britain, unfreeze royalties from his book and drop the threat of charges if he agreed to stop disclosing information about MI6 and speaking to the media. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, MI6 also apologised for its &quot;unfair treatment&quot; of him.

He now lives permanently in France and has retrained as a professional pilot.

==Personal life==
In 1998, Tomlinson was described as possessing &quot;the air of slight arrogance that goes with good looks, a hard-trained body and a sharp intellect&quot;. The Geneva press reported that he had a &quot;perfect command of French&quot;.

<doc id="980288" wikidata="Q2641332" url="?curid=980288" title="32 County Sovereignty Movement">
<text>The 32 County Sovereignty Movement, often abbreviated to 32CSM or 32csm, is an Irish republican group that was founded by Bernadette Sands McKevitt. It does not contest elections but acts as a pressure group, with branches or &quot;cumainn&quot; organised throughout the traditional counties of Ireland.

The 32CSM had been described as the &quot;political wing&quot; of the now defunct Real IRA, but this was denied by both organisations. The group originated in a split from Sinn Féin over the Mitchell Principles. The group was designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. 

== Objectives ==
* &quot;The restoration of Irish national sovereignty&quot;.
* &quot;To seek to achieve unity among the Irish people on the issue of restoring national sovereignty and to promote the revolutionary ideals of republicanism and to this end involve itself in resisting all forms of colonialism and imperialism.&quot;
* &quot;To seek the immediate and unconditional release of all Irish republican prisoners throughout the world.&quot;

== History ==
The organisation was founded as the 32 County Sovereignty Committee on 7 December 1997 at a meeting of like-minded Irish republicans in Finglas in Dublin. Those present were opposed to the direction taken by Sinn Féin and other mainstream republican groups in the Northern Ireland peace process, which would lead to the Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) the following year. The same division in the republican movement led to the paramilitary group now known as the Real IRA breaking away from the Provisional Irish Republican Army at around the same time.

Most of its founders had been members of Sinn Féin; some had been expelled from the party for challenging the leadership&#x27;s direction, while others felt they had not been properly able to air their concerns within Sinn Féin at the direction its leadership had taken. Bernadette Sands McKevitt, wife of Michael McKevitt and a sister of hunger striker Bobby Sands, was a prominent member of the group until a split in the organisation.

The name refers to the 32 counties of Ireland which were created during the Lordship and Kingdom of Ireland. With the partition of Ireland in 1920–1922; 26 of these counties formed the Irish Free State which was abolished in 1937 and is now known as Ireland since 1949; the remaining six counties of Northern Ireland remain part of the United Kingdom. Founder Bernadette Sands McKevitt said in a 1998 interview with the &quot;Irish Mirror&quot; that people did not fight for &quot;peace&quot; – &quot;they fought for independence&quot; – and that the organisation reaffirms to the republican position in the 1919 Irish Declaration of Independence.

Before the referendums on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the 32CSM lodged a legal submission with the United Nations challenging British sovereignty in Ireland. The referendums were opposed by the 32CSM, but were supported by 71% of voters in Northern Ireland and by 94% in the Republic of Ireland. It was reported in February 2000 that the group established a &quot;branch&quot; in Kilburn, London.

In November 2005 the 32CSM launched a political initiative titled &quot;Irish Democracy, A Framework For Unity.&quot;

On 24 May 2014, Gary Donnelly, a member of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, was elected to the Derry and Strabane super council. In July 2014, a delegation from the 32 County Sovereignty Movement travelled to Canada, to take part in a six-day speaking tour. On arrival the delegation was detained and refused entry into Canada.

==Protests==

The 32CSM has protested against what it calls &quot;internment by remand&quot; in both jurisdictions in Ireland.

Other protests include ones against former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley in Cobh, County Cork, against former British Prime Minister John Major being given the Keys to Cork city, against a visit to the Republic of Ireland by Police Service of Northern Ireland head Sir Hugh Orde, and against the Israeli occupation of Palestine and Anglo-American occupation of Iraq.

In 2015, the 32CSM organised a demonstration in Dundee, Scotland, in solidarity with the men convicted of shooting Constable Stephen Carroll, the first police officer to be killed in Northern Ireland since the formation of the PSNI. The organisation says the &quot;Craigavon Two&quot; are innocent and have been victims of a miscarriage of justice.

==Legality==
The group is currently considered a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in the United States, because the group is considered to be inseparable from the Real IRA, which is designated as an FTO. At a briefing in 2001, a spokesman for the US Department of State stated that &quot;evidence provided by both the British and Irish governments and open source materials demonstrate clearly that the individuals who created the Real IRA also established these two entities to serve as the public face of the Real IRA. These alias organizations engage in propaganda and fundraising on behalf of and in collaboration with the Real IRA.&quot; The US Department of State&#x27;s designation made it illegal for Americans to provide material support to the Real IRA, requires US financial institutions to block the group&#x27;s assets and denies alleged RIRA members visas into the US.

==Outside Ireland==
The 32CSM also operates outside of the island of Ireland to some extent. The Gaughan/Stagg Cumann covers England, Scotland and Wales, and has an active relationship of mutual promotion with a minority of British left wing groups, and antifascist organisations. The James Larkin Republican Flute Band (founded in 1996) in Liverpool, and the West of Scotland Band Alliance (founded in 1979)—the largest section of which is the Glasgow-based Parkhead Republican Flute Band—are also supporters of the 32CSM (the larger flute band communities in these areas tend to be aligned to Sinn Féin instead). As of 2014, the 32CSM&#x27;s alleged paramilitary wing, the Real IRA, was reported to have been still involved in attempts to perpetrate bombings in Britain as part of the Dissident Irish republican campaign, which has been ongoing since 1998.

<doc id="980304" wikidata="Q1888852" url="?curid=980304" title="Zubr (political organization)">
<text>Zubr () was a civic youth organization of the Belarusian opposition, formerly active in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. The organization drew inspiration from Otpor! student movement (formerly of Yugoslavia) which contributed to the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in 2000, and from Gene Sharp&#x27;s writings on nonviolent action. Zubr became noticed internationally in 2005 when US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was visiting Lithuania, met their leaders, who risked imprisonment upon their return. Some reporters have credited Zubr&#x27;s leaders with the idea of a &#x27;Denim Revolution&#x27;, which, they hoped would attract popular support as Ukraine&#x27;s Orange Revolution and Georgia&#x27;s Rose Revolution. However, Lukashenko had said that &quot;In our country, there will be no pink or orange, nor even a banana revolution&quot;.

Like many other opposition activists, Zubr members are often harassed and imprisoned by Belarus&#x27;s police and KGB. On 23 December 2005, Zubr activists Pavel Modzharo (Павел Моджаро), Aleksandr Morozov (Александр Морозов) and another colleague were arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs, which, they insisted, plainclothes security officers had planted on them. On 16 February 2006, Zubr leaders Aleh Myatselitsa and Pavel Yukhnevich were among the detained after a police break-up of a peaceful protest calling for the release of political prisoners. Two other members were arrested on 20 February for handing out stickers the same day.

During the 2006 presidential election, Zubr had supported Alaksandar Milinkievič, the opposition United Democratic Forces of Belarus candidate. After international election monitors criticized the conduct of that election, there were several demonstrations at which protestors flew the Zubr flag next to the first post-independence Belarusian white-red-white tricolour and the EU flag.

After the elections in 2006, &quot;Zubr&quot; ceased its existence.

== Polish Division of &quot;Zubr&quot; ==
After the elections in 2001, some of the activists went to emigration to Poland, where they met Polish supporters of the Belarusian opposition. Together, they made several actions of support and solidarity for Belarusian democrats:

* demonstrations near the Belarusian embassy in Warsaw on the anniversary of disappearances of Belarusian oppositionists, and so-called &quot;Chain of Concerned People&quot;
* spreading of informational leaflets for Poles about Human rights in Belarus
* cooperation with Polish youth organizations

The Polish Division of &quot;Zubr&quot; was virtually independent from the Belarusian one, but the chosen name had some disadvantages. For example, the Polish organization were trying to contact the organization in Belarus to consult common activity, and Belarusians living in Poland, working in organizations not friendly towards &quot;Zubr&quot;, refused cooperation.

Because of this, the organization decided in November 2003 to rename the organization to &quot;Union for Democracy in Belarus&quot;, a more neutral name.

<doc id="980309" wikidata="Q7973522" url="?curid=980309" title="Water injection (oil production)">
<text>In the oil industry, waterflooding or water injection is where water is injected into the oil reservoir, to maintain the pressure (also known as voidage replacement), or to drive oil towards the wells, and thereby increase production. Water injection wells may be located on- and offshore, to increase oil recovery from an existing reservoir.

Normally only 30% of the oil in a reservoir can be extracted, but water injection increases the recovery (known as the recovery factor) and maintains the production rate of a reservoir over a longer period.

Waterflooding began accidentally in Pithole, Pennsylvania by 1865. Waterflooding became common in Pennsylvania in the 1880s.

== Sources of injection water ==

Most sources of bulk water can be used for injection. The following sources of water are used for recovery of oil:

Produced water is often used as an injection fluid. This reduces the potential of causing formation damage due to incompatible fluids, although the risk of scaling or corrosion in injection flowlines or tubing remains. Also, the produced water, being contaminated with hydrocarbons and solids, must be disposed of in some manner, and disposal to sea or river will require clean-up treatment of the water stream first. However, the processing required to render produced water fit for reinjection may be equally costly.

As the volumes of water being produced are never sufficient to replace all the production volumes (oil and gas, in addition to water), additional &quot;make-up&quot; water must be provided. Mixing waters from different sources exacerbates the risk of scaling.

Seawater may be the most convenient source for offshore production facilities, and it may be pumped inshore for use in land fields. Where possible, the water intake is placed at sufficient depth to reduce the concentration of algae; however, filtering, deoxygenation, treatment with a biocide is generally required.

Aquifer water from water-bearing formations other than the oil reservoir, but in the same structure, has the advantage of purity and chemical compatibility where available. However this will not be allowed if the aquifer is a source of potable water as, for instance, in Saudi Arabia.

River water will require filtration and treatment with a biocide before injection.

== Filters ==

Filters clean the water and remove impurities, such as sediments, shells, sand, algae and other biological matter. Typical filtration is to 2 micrometres, but depends on reservoir requirements. After filtration the remaining matter in the filtrate is fine enough to avoid blockage of the pores of the reservoir. Sand filters are a commonly used filtration technology.
The sand filter has beds with various sizes of sand granules. The water flows through the first, coarsest, layer of sand down to the finest. To clean the filter the process is inverted. After the water is filtered it continues to the de-oxygenation tower.
Sand filters are bulky, heavy, have some spill over of sand particles and require chemicals to enhance water quality.
A more sophisticated approach is to use automatic self-cleaning backflushable screen filters (suction scanning).

The importance of proper water treatment is crucial; especially with river-, and seawater, intake water quality can vary significantly (algae blooming in spring, storms and current stirring up sediments from the seafloor) which may have significant impact on the performance of the water treatment facilities.
This may result in poor water quality, bioclogging of the reservoir and reduction of oil production.

== De-oxygenation ==

Oxygen must be removed from the water because it promotes corrosion and growth of certain bacteria. Bacterial growth in the reservoir can produce hydrogen sulfide, a source of production problems, and may block the pores in the rock.

A deoxygenation tower brings the injection water into contact with a gas stream (gas is readily available in the oilfield). The filtered water flows down the de-oxygenation tower, splashing onto a series of trays or packing causing dissolved air to be transferred to the gas stream.

An alternative or supplementary method, also used as a backup to deoxygenation towers, is to add an oxygen scavenging agent such as sodium bisulfite and ammonium bisulphite.

Another option is to use membrane contactors. Membrane contactors bring the water into contact with an inert gas stream, such as nitrogen, to strip out dissolved oxygen. Membrane contactors have the advantage of being lower weight and compact enabling smaller system designs.

== Water injection pumps ==

The high pressure, high flow water injection pumps are placed near to the de-oxygenation tower and boosting pumps. They fill the base of the reservoir with the filtered water to push the oil towards the wells like a piston. The result of the injection is not quick, it needs time.

== Water injection plants ==
The configuration of the plant elements described above and their operating conditions are outlined in this section. These examples are the former Amoco North West Hutton installation and the Buzzard installation in the North Sea.

=== North West Hutton ===
The water injection system had two design cases

* Case A – Injection of 100,000 barrels of water per day (BWPD) (662 m3/hr), injection pumps operating in parallel with a discharge pressure of 3,000 psi (207 bar)
* Case B – 60,000/65,000 BWPD (397/431 m3/hr), pumps in series /parallel, discharge pressure is 3,000 psi (207 bar) and 30,000/35,000 BWPD (198/232 m3/hr) with a discharge pressure of 5,000 psi (345 bar)

The two duty seawater lift pumps discharged water at 1,590 m3/hr and 30.5 psi (2.1 barg) to the seawater filters. These comprised six dual media (garnet and anthracite) filter beds. Normal flow was downwards. Backwash flow of water and air was upwards with flush water discharged overboard. Backwashing was initiated by a high differential pressure across a filter bed. 

Filtered water was routed to the top of the deaerator. This was a vertical vessel 12.6 m high and 4.0 m diameter, the internals comprise a packed bed. Air was stripped from the water by an upflow of fuel gas, gas/air was routed from the top of the vessel to the flare. Oxygen scavenger was injected into the deaerator vessel to remove any residual oxygen. Deaerated water was drawn from the base of the vessel by the deaerator pumps and was transferred to the cold water header operating at 90 psig (6.2 barg).

Process and utility coolers were supplied from the cold water header, warm water from the coolers was routed to the degassing drum where any air or gas was removed. From the degassing drum water passed to the injection filters.

Water was filtered in the water injection filters, one duty and one on standby/backwash. From the filters water was routed to the water injection pumps.

The three water injection pumps each had a capacity of 221 m3/hr with a differential head of 2068.5 metres (209 bar). The pumps discharged to the 3,000 psi manifold and wellheads. The single water injection booster pump (221 m3/hr, 1,379 m (139 bar) differential head) took its suction from the discharge of the water injection pumps and discharged to the 5,000 psi (345 bar) manifold and wellheads.

There were eight water injection wells, each well had a capacity of 15,000 BWPD (99.4 m3/hr).

=== Buzzard ===
An alternative configuration and technology is used on the Buzzard field in the North Sea. Seawater lift pumps deliver 4,000m3/hr at 12 barg to the seawater coarse filtration package. After filtration the water is used to cool the cooling medium in the cooling medium plate exchangers. 2322.7 m3/hr of seawater now at 6 barg and 20°C is routed to the fine filters and then to the sulphate removal membrane where reverse osmosis is used to remove sulphate ions from the water.

Desulphated water flows to the top of the deaerator column, this operates at a partial vacuum (0.3 bara) sustained by the deaerator vacuum unit. The deaerator internals comprise three packed beds. Deaerated water is taken from the base of the deaerator by transfer pumps which deliver 1632 m3/hr at 3.6 barg to the degasser surge drum. From the surge drum water is transferred to the water injection pumps which deliver water at up to 250,000 BWPD to up to 11 water injection wells.

Produced water is also injected into the reservoir at up to 350,000 BWPD.

<doc id="980323" wikidata="Q649778" url="?curid=980323" title="Argosy (ship)">
<text>An argosy is a merchant ship, or a fleet of such ships. As used by Shakespeare (e.g., in &quot;King Henry VI&quot;, Part 3, Act 2, Scene VI; in the &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;, Act 1, Scene I and Scene III; and in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Act 2, Scene I), the word means a flotilla of merchant ships operating together under the same ownership. 

It is derived from the 16th century city Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, in Croatia), a major shipping power of the day and entered the language through the Italian &quot;ragusea&quot;, meaning a Ragusan ship. The word bears no relation to the ship &quot;Argo&quot; from Greek mythology (Jason and the Argonauts). 

Since &quot;argosy&quot; and &quot;odyssey&quot; sound similar in British English and both refer to ships or voyage by ship (&quot;odyssey&quot; refers to Odysseus&#x27; journey, not to his ship, which goes unnamed in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;), occasionally &quot;argosy&quot; is misused as a synonym for &quot;odyssey&quot;, namely as an adventure.

<text>The Military Secretary is the British Army office with responsibility for appointments, promotion, postings and discipline of high ranking officers of the British Army. It is a senior British Army appointment, held by an officer holding the rank of major-general. The position of Deputy Military Secretary is held by an officer holding the rank of brigadier. The Military Secretary&#x27;s counterpart in the Royal Navy is the Naval Secretary. The Royal Air Force equivalent is the Air Secretary.

The post was initially established as the Public Secretary or Military Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1795 (prior to which a civilian had served as Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief).
The title was formally changed to Military Secretary to the Secretary of State for War in 1904. It was sometimes referred to in military jargon as Military Secretary at Headquarters. In 1964 it became Military Secretary to the Secretary of State for Defence.

In 1995 a new Army Personnel Centre was established in Glasgow with the Military Secretary as its Chief Executive.

<doc id="980328" wikidata="Q5054344" url="?curid=980328" title="Cauchy space">
<text>In general topology and analysis, a Cauchy space is a generalization of metric spaces and uniform spaces for which the notion of Cauchy convergence still makes sense. Cauchy spaces were introduced by H. H. Keller in 1968, as an axiomatic tool derived from the idea of a Cauchy filter, in order to study completeness in topological spaces. The category of Cauchy spaces and &quot;Cauchy continuous maps&quot; is Cartesian closed, and contains the category of proximity spaces.

==Definition==

Throughout, formula_1 is a set, formula_2 denotes the power set of formula_3 and all filters are assumed to be proper/non-degenerate (i.e. a filter may not contain the empty set). 

A Cauchy space is a pair formula_4 consisting of a set formula_1 together a family formula_6 of (proper) filters on formula_1 having all of the following properties:
# For each formula_8 the discrete ultrafilter at formula_9 denoted by formula_10 is in formula_11
# If formula_12 formula_13 is a proper filter, and formula_14 is a subset of formula_15 then formula_16 
# If formula_17 and if each member of formula_14 intersects each member of formula_15 then formula_20 
An element of formula_21 is called a Cauchy filter, and a map formula_22 between Cauchy spaces formula_4 and formula_24 is Cauchy continuous if formula_25; that is, the image of each Cauchy filter in formula_1 is a Cauchy filter base in formula_27

==Properties and definitions==

Any Cauchy space is also a convergence space, where a filter formula_14 converges to formula_29 if formula_30 is Cauchy. In particular, a Cauchy space carries a natural topology.

==Examples==

* Any uniform space (hence any metric space, topological vector space, or topological group) is a Cauchy space; see Cauchy filter for definitions.
* A lattice-ordered group carries a natural Cauchy structure.
* Any directed set formula_31 may be made into a Cauchy space by declaring a filter formula_14 to be Cauchy if, given any element formula_33 there is an element formula_34 such that formula_35 is either a singleton or a subset of the tail formula_36 Then given any other Cauchy space formula_3 the Cauchy-continuous functions from formula_31 to formula_1 are the same as the Cauchy nets in formula_1 indexed by formula_41 If formula_1 is complete, then such a function may be extended to the completion of formula_43 which may be written formula_44 the value of the extension at formula_45 will be the limit of the net. In the case where formula_31 is the set formula_47 of natural numbers (so that a Cauchy net indexed by formula_31 is the same as a Cauchy sequence), then formula_31 receives the same Cauchy structure as the metric space formula_50 

==Category of Cauchy spaces==

The natural notion of morphism between Cauchy spaces is that of a Cauchy-continuous function, a concept that had earlier been studied for uniform spaces.

<text>Malea pilosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is the only species in the genus Malea, and is native to Mexico.

Many botanists merge the species of the genus &quot;Malea&quot; into the large genus &quot;Vaccinium&quot;, where the species takes the name &quot;Vaccinium lundellianum&quot; L.O.Williams (the name &quot;Vaccinium pilosum&quot; cannot be used for this species as it already applies to a different species of &quot;Vaccinium&quot;).

<doc id="980335" wikidata="Q5526364" url="?curid=980335" title="Gas reinjection">
<text>Gas reinjection is the reinjection of natural gas into an underground reservoir, typically one already containing both natural gas and crude oil, in order to increase the pressure within the reservoir and thus induce the flow of crude oil or else sequester gas that cannot be exported. This is not to be confused with gas lift, where gas is injected into the annulus of the well rather than the reservoir. After the crude has been pumped out, the natural gas is once again recovered. Since many of the wells found around the world contain heavy crude, this process increases their production. The basic difference between light crude and heavy crude is its viscosity and pumpability—the lighter the crude the easier it is to pump. Recovery of hydrocarbons in a well is generally limited to 50% (heavy crudes) and 75–80% (light crudes). Recycling of natural gas or other inert gases causes the pressure to rise in the well, thus causing more gas molecules to dissolve in the oil lowering its viscosity and thereby increasing the well&#x27;s output. Air is not suitable for repressuring wells because it tends to cause deterioration of the oil, thus carbon dioxide or natural gas is used to repressure the well. The term &#x27;gas-reinjection&#x27; is also sometimes referred to as repressuring—the term being used only to imply that the pressure inside the well is being increased to aid recovery.

Injection or reinjection of carbon dioxide also takes place in order to reduce the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere, a form of carbon sequestration. This has been proposed as a method to combat climate change, allowing mass storage of CO2 over a geological timescale. Reinjection of carbon dioxide in the Norwegian Sleipner gas field saves the operators 1 million Norwegian Kroners per day in national carbon taxes.

<text>Ploče () is a town and seaport in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County of Croatia.

==Geography==
Ploče is located on the Adriatic coast in Dalmatia just north of the Neretva Delta and is the natural seaside endpoint of most north-south routes through the central Dinaric Alps. This makes it the primary seaport used by Bosnia and Herzegovina and the endpoint of the Pan-European corridor 5C.

Čeveljuša is a toponym in Ploče, located to the east of the town, on the intersection of the D8 highway and the D425.

=== Climate ===

Ploče is the location of Croatia&#x27;s high temperature record, measured at on 4 and 5 August 1981.

==History==
The town was first mentioned in 1387 as &quot;Ploča&quot;. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a port named Aleksandrovo after Alexander I of Yugoslavia was constructed in 1939. During the socialist Yugoslavia, between 1950 and 1954, and again from 1980 to 1990, Ploče was named Kardeljevo after the Yugoslav politician Edvard Kardelj. Some locals call their city Ploča (&quot;the stone&quot;).

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, its population was 8,220 with 4,711 living in the city proper.

The total population of Ploče was 10,135 in 2011, in the following settlements:

* Baćina, population 572
* Banja, population 173
* Komin, population 1,243
* Peračko Blato, population 288
* Plina Jezero, population 44
* Ploče, population 6,013
* Rogotin, population 665
* Staševica, population 902
* Šarić Struga, population 235

In the 2011 census, the majority of its citizens were Croats at 95.93%.

==Port==
The Port of Ploče was first mentioned on 6 November 1387, but the building of a larger port was done in recent modern times. Work on the present day harbour first began in 1939 but was destroyed during World War II. It was rebuilt in 1945 and the village of Ploče grew up to 480 inhabitants in 1948. After the Adriatic Highway and the Sarajevo–Ploče railway (the latter was connected to the port and replaced the older narrow-gauge railway) were opened in the mid-1960s, the town experienced steady growth.

Bosnia and Croatia are currently in negotiations as regards the establishment of a &quot;privileged economic zone&quot; for Bosnian businesses within the Ploče port facilities, though this development is hindered by the opposition of local government, and Croatian people to the concept of a partial loss of sovereignty over the port. The Bosnian government would like a concession, with sovereignty features, for at least 99 years, whereas the Croatian government only wishes to offer commercial passage through Croatian territory for Bosnian and Herzegovinian goods. This topic was a subject of lengthy negotiations; easier passage for Croatian citizens through the narrow strip of Bosnia and Herzegovina territory (that divides Croatia&#x27;s land territory) near Neum, in exchange for privileges for Bosnia and Herzegovina in Ploče. The Pelješac Bridge that bypasses Neum and Bosnian territory completely opened in 2022 although at first the project was strongly resisted by the Bosnian government.
==Railway transport==
Ploče is served by the Sarajevo–Ploče railway, a standard-gauge railway opened in 1966.

Previously, narrow-gauge railways operated in the area.

==Sister Cities==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Ploče is twinned with:
* Ljubljana, Slovenia
* Rodi Garganico

<doc id="980345" wikidata="Q1754876" url="?curid=980345" title="Espalier">
<text>Espalier ( or ) is the horticultural and ancient agricultural practice of controlling woody plant growth for the production of fruit, by pruning and tying branches to a frame. Plants are frequently shaped in formal patterns, flat against a structure such as a wall, fence, or trellis, and also plants which have been shaped in this way.

Espaliers, trained into flat two-dimensional forms, are used not only for decorative purposes, but also for gardens in which space is limited. In a temperate climate, espaliers may be trained next to a wall that can reflect more sunlight and retain heat overnight or oriented so that they absorb maximum sunlight by training them parallel to the equator. These two strategies allow the season to be extended so that fruit has more time to mature.

A restricted form of training consists of a central stem and a number of paired horizontal branches all trained in the same plane. The most important advantage is that of being able to increase the growth of a branch by training it vertically. Later, one can decrease growth while increasing fruit production by training it horizontally.

==History==
The word is French, coming from the Italian , meaning &quot;something to rest the shoulder () against.&quot; During the 17th century, the word initially referred only to the actual trellis or frame on which such a plant was trained to grow, but over time it has come to be used to describe both the practice and the plants themselves.

Espalier as a technique seems to have started with the ancient Romans. In the Middle Ages the Europeans refined it into an art. The practice was popularly used in Europe to produce fruit inside the walls of a typical castle courtyard without interfering with the open space and to decorate solid walls by planting flattened trees near them. Vineyards have used the technique in the training of grapes for hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years.

==Belgian fence ==
A Belgian fence is created by cutting back an unbranched, slender tree to between above the ground. The topmost three buds are allowed to form; one in the middle is trained vertically while two others are trained into a V shape. Any other buds are rubbed away. Removing the vertical stem completes the individual V-shaped espalier. By placing many similarly trained trees in a line two feet apart with their branches trained to the same plane, a Belgian fence is created.

The Belgian fence is an intermediary form that can then be used to train onward to many other forms of espalier, including: Step-over, where the branches are lowered down to the horizontal in autumn while still flexible enough and tied to a trellis; Fan, where the branches are lowered and cut back then trained further; Horizontal T, where the branches are trained to horizontal as with step-over but the vertical stem is trained up to another level and cut usually in spring of the second year, where another V shape is created and the resulting branches finally being lowered to another wire in autumn of the second year. Multiple levels of horizontal branching can be trained in this way.

==Species choices==
Certain types of trees adapt better to espalier than others, but almost any woody plant can be trained to grow along a flat plane by removing growth outside that plane.
Horizontal T training of an apple or pear tree is a good example of the ideal species for espalier. In the spring, the tree is pruned to the lowest wire perhaps above the ground. During the summer, buds lengthen into branches; one trained vertically to the next wire while others are trained along the wires. Unnecessary buds are removed by rubbing them away with a thumb. In autumn, the side branches are lowered and tied to the wires completing the level. The following year another level is created.

Examples of species for espalier include:
*Trees:
**&quot;Acer palmatum&quot; Japanese Maple
**&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot; Redbud
**&quot;Citrus spp.&quot; Lemon, Orange, Tangerine, etc.

**&quot;Malus spp.&quot; Apple, Crabapple, etc.
**&quot;Olea europia&quot; Olive
**&quot;Prunus spp.&quot; Peach, Nectarine, Plum, Almond, etc.
**&quot;Pyrus spp.&quot; Pear
**&quot;Taxus sp.&quot; Yew

*Shrubs:

**&quot;Photinia serrulata&quot; Chinese Photinia
**&quot;Podocarpus spp.&quot; Podocarpus
**&quot;Pyracantha spp.&quot; Firethorn, esp. Pyracantha coccinea&quot; Pyracantha coccinea
**&quot;Stewartia Koreana&quot; Korean Stewartia
**&quot;Viburnum sp.&quot; Viburnum

*Woody vines:
**&quot;Allamanda cathartica&quot; Allamanda
**&quot;Ficus pumila&quot; Creeping fig
**&quot;Jasminum nudiflorum&quot; Winter Jasmine
**&quot;Pyrostegia venusta&quot; Flame vine
**&quot;Trachelospermum jasminoides&quot; Confederate jasmine
==Designs==

Espalier design often uses traditional formal patterns developed over hundreds of years, but can also employ more modern informal designs. A stunted or deformed plant, or one that already has interesting or unique characteristics, might be just right for an informal espalier.

Common formal patterns include the following styles.
* V-shaped: Tree is cut to a low wire from the ground; two buds lengthen into branches which are attached to canes that keep them straight, and the canes are attached to another wire that maintains a V shape. The V shape is the first step in producing many other formal patterns.
* Belgian fence: More than one V-shaped espaliers are planted two feet apart, so their branches cross, and are tied to a trellis.
* Stepover: A Horizontal espalier with only one set of branches tied to a wire around above the ground. Start with a V shape until desired branch length is attained, but lower branches to the bottom wire by autumn of the first year. Takes only one year to produce the design from a well-rooted unbranched tree (it may take somewhat longer for it to start producing fruit).
* Horizontal T, also referred to as a horizontal cordon: Branches are trained horizontally along evenly spaced wires. Start with a V shape where a third bud is trained straight up to another wire. Train other two branches to stepover. In spring of second year prune the vertical stem to the second wire and again train to a V shape, etc. It takes one year per each level.
* Palmette or fan: Branches grow in a radiating pattern created when the branches of a V-shaped espalier are cut back and lowered slightly. Multiple buds are coaxed to form branches that are tied to a trellis in a radiating pattern.
* Baldassari palmette: A palmette design created around 1950, used primarily for training peaches.
* Cordon: Consists of a main stem with short fruiting spurs tied to a fence or a wire trellis. Probably the simplest and quickest espalier is the single vertical or angled cordon. The weakness of the vertical cordon is that it is difficult to rein in the vigor of the tree. An angled cordon reduces the vigor of its growth and increases fruit production.
* Verrier candelabra (Verrier palmette) is a type of vertical cordon with multiple upright stems that usually starts from a V shape.
* Gaucher palmette is a type of vertical cordon with multiple upright stems.
* Drapeau marchand: A cordon trained at an angle with the branches on its upper side trained to a right angle from the main stem.
* U double and other U-shaped espalier is just another way of referring to a double vertical cordon.

==Plant selection, installation, and maintenance==
Espalier plants on solid walls are usually installed from the base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and pest control. Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material. Masonry walls are ideal for placing U-bolts, eye bolts, or eye screws, anchored with either plastic plugs or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints. Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.

Suitable, established and healthy plants, three to four feet tall and perhaps in three-gallon containers, are available from most nurseries. Some may even have trellises already installed. These plants could also be good candidates for espalier treatment if their form is similar to the intended design, as they frequently have already been pruned into a flattened overall plant shape. All that is required for such specimens is transplanting. Unpruned plants benefit from being allowed to become well established following transplant, before pruning them gradually into their flattened profile and training them as designed. Any major pruning needed is generally accomplished either while the plant is dormant or, for flowering plants, during the proper season for pruning that species. Bending and training of the limbs that will remain in the design is done during the progression of the summer season, when they are most flexible.

<text>Ellipsanime Productions (formerly known as Le Studio Ellipse and Ellipse Programme) is a French animation studio that produces television programs. It was founded in 1987. In February 2000 it merged with Expand SA; Expand sold the company to Dargaud in 2003, and it became Ellipsanime in 2004. In 2014, Ellipsanime bought the assets of Moonscoop SA.

Ellipse has worked with many other animation companies, with the most reputable being Nelvana and Nickelodeon. Ellipse was best known in North America for co-producing seasons 2-4 of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Doug&quot;; it did not return to the series after The Walt Disney Company bought the &quot;Doug&quot; intellectual property and Jumbo Pictures.

On the occasion of the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June 2022, the Média-Participations group announced the creation of an umbrella brand Ellipse Animation which brings together its production labels in France Ellipsanime Productions, Dargaud Media and Dupuis Edition &amp; Audiovisual.

==History==
In 1987, the company was founded by Philippe Gildas and Robert Réa under the name &quot;Ellipse Programme&quot; with Canal+ as their first owner. Three years later in 1990, Ellipse Programme entered the animation production genre by launching their own animation division.

In February 2000, Canal+ announced that they&#x27;ve merged their subsidiary Ellipse Programme with French television production outfit Expand Images into one group under the Expand name with Ellipse Programme becoming Expand Group&#x27;s own division alongside Canal+ holding a 35% stake in the Expand Group.

In January 2003, Ellipsanime had announced that they were shutting down their executive production facility Ellipse Studio and had absorbed most of their studio&#x27;s production activity including their storyboarding and 3-D rendering work under the main animation production company. A month later in February of that same year, Ellipsanime&#x27;s then parent company Canal+ Group and its film production and distribution company StudioCanal under their subsidiary StudioExpand announced that they were planning to sell its animation studio Ellipsanime along with 19 other production companies that made up StudioExpand with Ellipsanime cutting down their annual series output.

On July 22, 2003, Ellipsanime announced that their previous parent company StudioCanal under their division StudioExpand had sold their animation production subsidiary Ellipsanime to French media entertainment conglomerate Média-Participations and their French-Belgian publishing company Dargaud, thrus marking Dargaud assuming ownership all of Ellipsanime&#x27;s production activities and gave Dargaud another animation production studio with Ellipsanime&#x27;s animated production portfolio joining Dargaud&#x27;s own animation production portfolio as Dargaud&#x27;s other animation and production unit Dargaud Marina became the largest animation production studio in France.

In January 2014, Ellipsanime announced that under the Paris bankruptcy court they&#x27;ve acquired the assets of French animation and production group MoonScoop which went into bankruptcy administration back in July 2013 with Ellipsanime retaining two of MoonScoop&#x27;s then-remaining employees and taken over MoonScoop&#x27;s production library under Dargaud&#x27;s international distribution division Mediatoon Distribution except their American division which was spliten.

In October 2017, Ellipsanime announced that they had partnered with independent game publishing and digital entertainment company Ankama to launch a joint venture 2D animation production studio based in Roubaix, Hauts-de-France named MadLab Animations to handle the two animation studios&#x27; own production services.

In June 2022 during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, Ellipsanime Productions alongside their parent company Dargaud and it&#x27;s owner Media Participations announced that their bringing their French animation production labels (which were Ellipsanime Productions, Dargaud Media and Dupuis Edition &amp; Audiovisuel) under one umbrella group named Ellipse Animation, returning to the Ellipse Animation name after 24 years.

In January 2024, Ellipse Animation announced that they have acquired a majority stake in Milan-based Italian production company Studio Campedelli. A week later in that same month, Ellipse Animation announced that they&#x27;ve expanded their operations into webtoons by launching a production division dedicated to animated series based on digital comics and will sit under Ellipse Animation&#x27;s own animation production studio Ellipse Studio Angoulême.

<doc id="980349" wikidata="Q1755111" url="?curid=980349" title="Kmara">
<text>Kmara (, ) was a civic youth resistance movement in Georgia, active in the protests prior to and during the November 2003 Rose Revolution, which toppled down the government of Eduard Shevardnadze. Consciously modeled on the Serbian nongovernmental organization (NGO) Otpor!, which had been instrumental in defeating Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s regime in 2000, the Kmara members were trained and advised by the influential Georgian NGO Liberty Institute and funded by the United States–based Open Society Institute (OSI). The movement was a hybrid of social movement and virtual NGO, which was highly successful in mobilizing the young Georgians, mostly students, against Shevardnadze&#x27;s rule. Although Kmara was allied with the opposition parties, especially Mikheil Saakashvili&#x27;s United National Movement, its behavior and tactics were nonpartisan, focusing on criticizing corruption and failures of the Shevardnadze regime, rather than promoting any particular politician or political party.

==Origin==
The Kmara movement emerged in April 2003. It was formed by the Georgian student activists which received training by the Serbian Otpor! through the funding of the OSI. The training was focused on sharing the Serbian experience of nonviolent action and Kmara&#x27;s logo was a near-exact copy of the Otpor&#x27;s clenched fist.

==Tactics==
Kmara organized a loose, decentralized network of the regional cells and employed simple, but effective methods to create a large-scale social movement against the government of Eduard Shevardnadze. Members spray-painted the word &quot;kmara&quot; (&quot;Enough!&quot;) on walls, buildings, streets, and elsewhere in even most remote places in Georgia. The slogan was quickly upheld by those who saw the Shevardnadze regime increasingly corrupt and failing. This effort was supplemented by noisy protest marches and aggressive media campaign. According to one of the co-founders of Kmara, Giorgi Kandelaki, &quot;Kmara succeeded in breaking through the public’s political apathy, particularly among young people.&quot;

==Activity==

The scale of Kmara&#x27;s actions grew as the November 2003 parliamentary election was approaching and many Georgians feared the government was ready to resort to election fraud. On April 14, 2003, Kmara made its first major appearance, staging a march of some 200 students from the Tbilisi State University to the State Chancellery, chanting their slogan &quot;kmara&quot; and demanding resignation of the &quot;corrupt government&quot; and President Shevardnadze. Since then, Kmara conducted several anti-government actions, drawing criticism from Shevardnadze&#x27;s allies, who, initially suggested that the movement was financed by the &quot;Russian special services&quot;. On August 6, 2003, police force was used to disperse the Kmara rally, protesting against the arrival of the Russian state-owned power company Unified Energy Systems (UES) to the Georgian energy market.

Kmara remained at the forefront of the mass rallies following the November 2003 parliamentary election, which was criticized by the opposition, NGOs and international observers. After the demonstrations brought about the resignation of Shevradnadze, Kmara shifted its focus in Adjara, a southwestern autonomous republic ran by Aslan Abashidze. The movement was continuously harassed by the Adjarian regime, which, in its turn, fell to the increasing pressure from the new Georgian government of Mikheil Saakashvili.

In 2005, Kmara worked with their counterparts in Belarus, named Zubr. In August 2005, two activists of the Georgian youth movement Kmara, Giorgi Kandelaki and Luka Tsuladze, were arrested in Minsk and held in prison for 15 days on charges of &quot;hooliganism&quot;. The human rights NGO Amnesty International condemned the arrest and said that it &quot;considers Luka Tsuladze and Giorgi Kandelaki to be prisoners of conscience.&quot;

<doc id="980358" wikidata="Q570615" url="?curid=980358" title="Florida High-Speed Corridor">
<text>The Florida High-Speed Corridor is a canceled once-publicly funded high-speed rail project in the U.S. state of Florida reestablished as private enterprise. Initial service would have run between the cities of Tampa and Orlando, with plans to then extend service to South Florida, terminating in Miami. Trains with a top speed of to would run on dedicated rail lines alongside the state&#x27;s existing highway network.

Construction of the line was slated to begin in 2011, with the initial Tampa-Orlando phase completed by 2014. On February 16, 2011, Florida Governor Rick Scott formally announced that he would be rejecting federal funds to construct the high-speed railway, thereby killing the Florida High-Speed Rail project. Governor Scott said the project would be &quot;far too costly to taxpayers&quot; and that &quot;the risk[s] far outweigh the benefits&quot;.

In the wake of the project&#x27;s cancellation, a private sector express passenger service running across much of the proposed route has been proposed by All Aboard Florida, now known as Brightline. This service began operations in 2018 and now runs passenger trains between Orlando and Miami. Its extension from Orlando to Tampa is in the early planning stages and has yet to be fully funded.

==Proposal==

After the original federal proposal in the 1960s, U.S. federal and state governments revisited the idea of fast trains occasionally. The Passenger Railroad Rebuilding Act of 1980 led to the funding of high-speed corridor studies in 1984. Private-sector consortia intending to build high-speed lines were created in Florida, Ohio, Texas, California, and Nevada. Maglev trains became a new field of interest. They were officially added to the definition of &quot;railroad&quot; in 1988 and were studied repeatedly. Five high-speed corridors were officially endorsed in October 1992 following the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. TEA-21 and other legislation continued to be passed with mentions of high-speed rail, but lacking funding or real direction.

==Planning==

===Original referendum===

In November 2000, Florida voters approved an amendment to Florida&#x27;s constitution mandating the state establish a system of high-speed trains exceeding to link its five largest urban areas, with construction commencing by November 1, 2003. The Florida Legislature enacted the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority Act in March 2001, creating the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA). The HSRA established a Vision Plan for the system which proposed construction in several phases. Preliminary assessments and environmental studies were begun to develop an initial phase of the system between Orlando and Tampa.

The first phase, planned for completion in 2009 under the original referendum, would have connected Orlando to Tampa (Phase 1, Part 1), with a later extension to St. Petersburg (Phase 1, Part 2). Later phases might have extended the network to Miami, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Tallahassee and Pensacola.

The Florida HSRA issued a Request for Proposal to Design, Build, Operate, Maintain and Finance (DBOM&amp;F) the Orlando to Tampa Phase In October 2002. Two of the four received in February 2003 were reviewed further, one from a consortium of Fluor Corp. and Bombardier Transportation and one from Global Rail Consortium. The proposals showed the cost of the Orlando-Tampa route to be approximately $2.4 billion. Both proposals offered private equity contributions to support operations of the system and show the willingness of the private sector to share the risk associated with projected ridership revenues. In June 2003, Florida Governor Jeb Bush vetoed funding for the project that the Florida Legislature approved. The HSRA continued moving forward with the project, using funds already authorized by the federal government, and in October 2003 ranked the Fluor Bombardier proposal first.

In early 2004, Governor Jeb Bush endorsed an effort to repeal the 2000 amendment that mandated the construction of the High-Speed Rail System. On October 27, 2004, the authority voted to prefer the consortium of Fluor Corp. and Bombardier Transportation to build and operate the system, using Bombardier&#x27;s JetTrain technology. However, a month later in November, Florida voters repealed the 2000 amendment, removing the constitutional mandate for the system. Although the amendment was repealed, no action was taken by the state legislature in regard to the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority Act. With the law still in effect, Florida&#x27;s HSRA continued to meet, and completed the environmental impact statement for the Tampa-Orlando segment in 2005. With the constitutional mandate gone, funding for the project stopped, and very little action was taken over the next several years.

===Plans revived in 2009===
Passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 designated $8 billion to develop a high-speed intercity passenger rail system. The Federal Railroad Administration named Florida one of ten high-speed rail corridors potentially eligible for federal funding. The HSRA met on February 26, 2009, to begin planning their application for these funds. Due to the passage of time, potential legal issues, and new federal funding criteria rendering the earlier bids from 2003 inapplicable, the decision was made in May 2009 that a new bidding process would be necessary. A first round application was submitted in August 2009 for $30 million to conduct a two-year environmental study on the Orlando-Miami route. In October 2009, the authority applied for the second round for the entire Tampa - Orlando - Miami corridor, broken into two components: Orlando-Tampa and Orlando-Miami. Connect Us, a political action committee, was launched on August 18, 2009, to rally public support for these applications.
On December 16, the Florida Legislature passed a bill authorizing FDOT to move forward with the purchase from CSX of the Central Florida Rail Corridor for the SunRail commuter rail project and providing additional funding for South Florida&#x27;s Tri-Rail commuter rail system. Funding of these initiatives was vital to the state&#x27;s hopes to win federal HSR funding, as it showed the state of Florida was committed to creating a comprehensive rail network allowing connectivity between high-speed rail and local mass transit systems. The legislation also replaced the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority with the Florida Rail Enterprise, a new agency created under the FDOT, responsible for construction, maintenance, and promotion of the state&#x27;s high-speed rail system, as well as development and operation of publicly funded passenger rail systems in general.
On January 28, 2010, the White House announced that Florida would receive $1.25 billion of its request, about half of the cost of the Tampa-Orlando segment. The state&#x27;s efforts towards high-speed rail between 2000 and 2005 put Florida ahead of the field in terms of the level of planning already completed, and this proved to be a major factor in winning the funds. The preservation of the I-4 corridor by the FDOT, and completion of the environmental impact studies in 2005 meant that the project could have proceeded to construction in a very short time frame for a relatively affordable cost. In March 2010 the Florida Rail Enterprise was still seeking to refine cost estimates based on advanced engineering, finish development of possible Early Works (Install permanent barrier systems along most of I-4 and remove/relocate elements in median) and contract for bid in 2010 and finally initiate a new bid procurement process specific to the Tampa to Orlando phase. In June 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration issued its record of the final decision, the final stage of approval for the design, purchase of land and construction of phase one. Tendering was thus able to begin. In October 2010, Florida received $800 million more towards construction from the FY 2010 High-Speed Rail allocations.

In December 2010 the US Department of Transportation redistributed approximately $1.2 billion in HSR funds that had been rejected by governors elected in Wisconsin and Ohio. Florida was projected to receive as much as $342.3 million of the reallocated rail funds, which would have closed the gap of the project&#x27;s projected cost. Construction of the line was to begin in 2011, with the initial phase completed by 2014.

===Cancellation===
On February 16, 2011, Governor Rick Scott formally announced that he would reject federal funds to construct the project, attempting to kill Florida High-Speed Rail. On March 4, 2011, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously turned down the request of State Senators Thad Altman, a Viera Republican, and Arthenia Joyner, a Tampa Democrat to force Scott to accept federal funding for the project. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that he would be redirecting the funds intended for Florida to other states and, on May 9, awarded $2.02 billion to 22 projects in 15 states.

== Extant construction ==

In July 2010, the Florida Department of Transportation began geotechnical sampling along the Orlando-Tampa corridor. The soil would have been tested every along the route to check soil conditions and allow proper foundation planning, had the project not been canceled.

==Route==
===Phase 1: Tampa to Orlando route===

In early planning stages, all routes but the one along the median of Interstate 4 (which has been and is being widened by several road construction projects) were dropped from consideration; alternates used the CSX tracks to the south of I-4. Stations would have been provided at downtown Tampa, northern Lakeland, Walt Disney World, and possibly at the Orange County Convention Center (see below), and at Orlando International Airport.

====Orlando area route selection====
Two routes were considered in the Orlando area. One would have split from I-4 at the interchange with SR 536, World Center Drive, and run east along SR 536 and SR 417, the Central Florida GreeneWay, to the south entrance to Orlando International Airport, from which it would head north to end at the planned South Terminal. The other route would continue along I-4 to SR 528, the Beachline Expressway, with an extra stop at the Orange County Convention Center and International Drive, and then run east along SR 528 and a new right-of-way east and southeast to the south entrance of the airport.

====Journey times====
The trains would have been capable of reaching speeds of &quot;&quot; but due to the number of proposed stations, a &quot;bullet train would beat a car by only 30 minutes.&quot; Proposed journey times for some routes:
====Planned stops====
The Orlando International Airport was planned to be the Orlando terminus of the initial Orlando-Tampa route. The airport had already invested considerably to accommodate the station, such as the extra length of the taxiway bridge over the southern access road. This station would have provided access for airport passengers and for Orlando&#x27;s Lynx local bus service.

The Orange County Convention Center is the second largest in the United States, located on International Drive, a major tourist strip connecting SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando Resort. The planned intermodal station here would have also provided access to Orlando&#x27;s Lynx local bus service, and to International Drive&#x27;s I-Ride trolley.

Walt Disney World was planning to donate a site for the station, although the exact location was never determined. The station would have linked into the extensive Disney Transport bus system. Also, the Walt Disney Company initially announced that if the SR 417 route was built, they would direct tourists to take the train from the airport to Walt Disney World. They would keep busing tourists if the SR 528 route was built. The SR 417 route was initially selected by a 7-1 vote on October 27, 2004. However, in November 2004, the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority dropped the SR 417 from consideration and selected the SR 528 route due to a lack satisfactory progress on the agreements with The Walt Disney Company and Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority.

Two locations were under consideration for a station near Lakeland, Florida. The top choice was near USF Polytechnic followed by a location near Kathleen Road.

A site in downtown Tampa had been cleared for a multi-modal station at the terminus of the route. The station would have been located next to the Marion Transit Center, the main hub of the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit system. A connection to Tampa International Airport was also being considered

=== Phase 2: Orlando to Miami route ===

The second phase of the project would have been an Orlando-Miami link. As of the Regional Rail Briefing in Lakeland, Florida, on March 24, 2010, two routes were under consideration. One route followed SR 528 past the Orlando International Airport toward Cape Canaveral, before joining and following Interstate 95 down to Miami. The other route traveled south along Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to Miami. The environmental impact study for the corridor began in 2010 and would have taken approximately two years to complete.

The higher-speed rail route of Brightline, being developed between Orlando and Miami, closely follows the Cape Canaveral route.

<text>Boxer shorts (also commonly known as simply boxers) are a type of undergarment typically worn by men.
The term has been used in English since 1944 for all-around-elastic shorts, so named after the shorts worn by boxers, for whom unhindered leg movement (&quot;footwork&quot;) is very important. Boxers come in a variety of styles and design but are characterized by their loose fit.

== History ==
In 1925, Jacob Golomb, founder of Everlast, designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as &quot;boxer trunks&quot;, immediately became famous, but were later eclipsed by the popular Jockey-style briefs beginning in the late 1930s. The two styles, briefs and boxer shorts, had varying ratios of sales for the following fifty years, with strong regional and generational preferences.

In 1985, in the U.S. men&#x27;s briefs were more popular than boxer shorts, with four times as many briefs sold compared to boxers. Around that time many of the men who preferred boxers were older men who became accustomed to wearing them during their time in the U.S. military, and best selling color of boxers was white. 

Boxer shorts got a fashion boost in 1985 when English model and musician Nick Kamen stripped to white Sunspel boxers in a 1950s-style &quot;launderette&quot; in a Levi&#x27;s commercial . After that time boxers were beginning to become popular among young men, who wore boxers with varying colors and prints.

Since the 1990s, some men also opt for boxer briefs as a compromise between the two. , one American manufacturer reported that woven boxer shorts made up 15–20 per cent of men&#x27;s underwear sales, but had been declining in popularity compared to boxer briefs since 2003.

== Design ==
Most boxer shorts have a fly in front. Boxer shorts manufacturers have a couple of methods of closing the fly: metal snaps or a button or two. However, many boxer shorts on the market do not need a fastening mechanism to close up the fly as the fabric is cut and the boxers are designed to sufficiently overlap and fully cover the opening. This is commonly known as an open fly design.

Since boxer shorts’ fabric is rarely stretchy, a &quot;balloon seat&quot;, a generous panel of loosely fitting fabric in the center rear of the shorts, is designed to accommodate the wearer&#x27;s various movements, especially bending forward. The most common sewing design of boxer shorts are made with a panel seat that has two seams running on the outer edges of the back seating area, creating a center rear panel. Most mass-produced commercial boxer shorts are made using this design.

Two less common forms of boxer shorts are &quot;gripper&quot; boxers and &quot;yoke-front&quot; boxers. Gripper boxers have an elastic waistband like regular boxers but have snaps, usually three, on the fly and on the waistband so that they open up completely.

Yoke front boxers are similar to gripper boxers in that the wide waistband yoke can be opened up completely, and the yoke usually has three snaps to close it while the fly itself, below, has no closure mechanism. There are two types of yoke boxers: one in which there is a short piece of elastic on each side of the waistband which snugs up the yoke to fit the waist; and &quot;tie-sides&quot; which have narrow cloth tapes on each side of the waist yoke, like strings, which are tightened and knotted by the wearer to make an exact fit. This style of underpant was very common during World War II, when the rubber needed for elastic waistbands had to be used for military purposes.

Boxer shorts are available in white and solid colors including pastels, and come in a variety of patterns and prints as well; Traditional patterns include &quot;geometrics&quot; (small repeating geometric designs), plaids and vertical stripes. Additionally, there are innumerable &quot;novelty&quot; boxer short patterns. Boxer shorts are produced using various fabrics including all cotton, cotton–polyester blends, jersey knits, satin, and silk.

== Fertility ==
Some studies have suggested that tight underpants (like briefs) and high temperature are not optimally conducive for sperm production. The testicles are outside the body for cooling because they operate for sperm production at a slightly lower temperature than the rest of the body, and boxer shorts allow the testicles to operate within the required temperature range. The compression of the genitals in briefs, boxer briefs, or thongs may cause the temperature to rise and sperm production to fall. There is a similar theory regarding testicular cancer risk. Other sources dispute this theory. A study in the October 1998 &quot;Journal of Urology&quot;, for example, concluded that underwear type is unlikely to have a significant effect on male fertility.

== Boxer shorts for women ==
Boxer shorts for women have come onto the market in recent years. They are often worn as loungewear. They differ from boyshorts in that they are commonly longer and more closely resemble their male counterparts. There have been reports that women have been buying men&#x27;s boxers for use as underwear.

== In popular culture ==
In 1975, a Sears catalog photo of boxer shorts created a recurring urban legend. A model appeared to have part of his penis exposed in the photo, which a Sears spokesperson stated was a printing defect. Despite widespread press interest at the time, Sears reported that only a few letters were received from the general public, and noted that when the image was reprinted in the Spring-Summer catalog, it showed no such flaw. No recall of the catalog occurred. The incident inspired the singer Zoot Fenster&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;The Man on Page 602&quot;.

A noticeable comedy routine that involves boxer shorts, most notably used in cartoons, is to have a character wear boxer shorts that has a humorous print or pattern on them, usually hearts or polka-dots, when one&#x27;s trousers had fallen down or ripped apart.

<doc id="980365" wikidata="Q281325" url="?curid=980365" title="Ring species">
<text>In biology, a ring species is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which interbreeds with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two &quot;end populations&quot; in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential gene flow between each &quot;linked&quot; population and the next. Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, &quot;end populations&quot; may co-exist in the same region (sympatry) thus closing a &quot;ring&quot;. The German term , meaning a circle of races, is also used.

Ring species represent speciation and have been cited as evidence of evolution. They illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, specifically because they represent, in living populations, what normally happens over time between long-deceased ancestor populations and living populations, in which the intermediates have become extinct. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins remarks that ring species &quot;are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension&quot;.

Formally, the issue is that &quot;interfertility&quot; (ability to interbreed) is not a transitive relation; if A breeds with B, and B breeds with C, it does not mean that A breeds with C, and therefore does not define an equivalence relation. A ring species is a species with a counterexample to the transitivity of interbreeding. However, it is unclear whether any of the examples of ring species cited by scientists actually permit gene flow from end to end, with many being debated and contested.

==History==
The classic ring species is the &quot;Larus&quot; gull. In 1925 Jonathan Dwight found the genus to form a chain of varieties around the Arctic Circle. However, doubts have arisen as to whether this represents an actual ring species. In 1938, Claud Buchanan Ticehurst argued that the greenish warbler had spread from Nepal around the Tibetan Plateau, while adapting to each new environment, meeting again in Siberia where the ends no longer interbreed. These and other discoveries led Mayr to first formulate a theory on ring species in his 1942 study &quot;Systematics and the Origin of Species&quot;. Also in the 1940s, Robert C. Stebbins described the &quot;Ensatina&quot; salamanders around the Californian Central Valley as a ring species; but again, some authors such as Jerry Coyne consider this classification incorrect. Finally in 2012, the first example of a ring species in plants was found in a spurge, forming a ring around the Caribbean Sea.

==Speciation==
The biologist Ernst Mayr championed the concept of ring species, stating that it unequivocally demonstrated the process of speciation. A ring species is an alternative model to allopatric speciation, &quot;illustrating how new species can arise through &#x27;circular overlap&#x27;, without interruption of gene flow through intervening populations…&quot; However, Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr point out that rings species more closely model parapatric speciation.

Ring species often attract the interests of evolutionary biologists, systematists, and researchers of speciation leading to both thought provoking ideas and confusion concerning their definition. Contemporary scholars recognize that examples in nature have proved rare due to various factors such as limitations in taxonomic delineation or, &quot;taxonomic zeal&quot;—explained by the fact that taxonomists classify organisms into &quot;species&quot;, while ring species often cannot fit this definition. Other reasons such as gene flow interruption from &quot;vicariate divergence&quot; and fragmented populations due to climate instability have also been cited.

Ring species also present an interesting case of the species problem for those seeking to divide the living world into discrete species. All that distinguishes a ring species from two separate species is the existence of the connecting populations; if enough of the connecting populations within the ring perish to sever the breeding connection then the ring species&#x27; distal populations will be recognized as two distinct species. The problem is whether to quantify the whole ring as a single species (despite the fact that not all individuals interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (despite the fact that it interbreeds with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that species boundaries arise gradually and often exist on a continuum.

==Examples==

Many examples have been documented in nature. Debate exists concerning much of the research, with some authors citing evidence against their existence entirely. The following examples provide evidence that—despite the limited number of concrete, idealized examples in nature—continuums of species do exist and can be found in biological systems. This is often characterized by sub-species level classifications such as clines, ecotypes, complexes, and varieties. Many examples have been disputed by researchers, and equally &quot;many of the [proposed] cases have received very little attention from researchers, making it difficult to assess whether they display the characteristics of ideal ring species.&quot;

The following list gives examples of ring species found in nature. Some of the examples such as the &quot;Larus&quot; gull complex, the greenish warbler of Asia, and the &quot;Ensatina&quot; salamanders of America, have been disputed.

*&quot;Acanthiza pusilla&quot; and &quot;A. ewingii&quot;
*&quot;Acacia karroo&quot;
*&quot;Alauda&quot; skylarks (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;, &quot;A. japonica&quot; and &quot;A. gulgula&quot;)
*&quot;Alophoixus&quot;
*&quot;Aulostomus&quot; (Trumpetfish)
*&quot;Camarhynchus psittacula&quot; and &quot;C. pauper&quot;
*&quot;Chaerephon pumilus&quot; species complex
*&quot;Ensatina&quot; salamanders
*&quot;Euphorbia tithymaloides&quot; is a group within the spurge family that has reproduced and evolved in a ring through Central America and the Caribbean, meeting in the Virgin Islands where they appear to be morphologically and ecologically distinct.
*Great tit (however, some studies dispute this example)
*The greenish warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus trochiloides&quot;) forms a species ring, around the Himalayas. It is thought to have spread from Nepal around the inhospitable Tibetan Plateau, to rejoin in Siberia, where the &quot;plumbeitarsus&quot; and the &quot;viridanus&quot; appeared to no longer mutually reproduce.
*&quot;Hoplitis producta&quot;
*House mouse
*&quot;Junonia coenia&quot; and &quot;J. genoveva&quot;/&quot;J. evarete&quot;
*&quot;Lalage leucopygialis&quot;, &quot;L. nigra&quot;, and &quot;L. sueurii&quot;
*&quot;Larus&quot; gulls form a circumpolar &quot;ring&quot; around the North Pole. The European herring gull (&quot;L. argentatus argenteus&quot;), which lives primarily in Great Britain and Ireland, can hybridize with the American herring gull (&quot;L. smithsonianus&quot;), (living in North America), which can also hybridize with the Vega or East Siberian herring gull (&quot;L. vegae&quot;), the western subspecies of which, Birula&#x27;s gull (&quot;L. vegae birulai&quot;), can hybridize with Heuglin&#x27;s gull (&quot;L. heuglini&quot;), which in turn can hybridize with the Siberian lesser black-backed gull (&quot;L. fuscus&quot;). All four of these live across the north of Siberia. The last is the eastern representative of the lesser black-backed gulls back in north-western Europe, including Great Britain. The lesser black-backed gulls and herring gulls are sufficiently different that they do not normally hybridize; thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except where the two lineages meet in Europe. However, a 2004 genetic study entitled &quot;The herring gull complex is not a ring species&quot; has shown that this example is far more complex than presented here (Liebers et al., 2004): this example only speaks to the complex of species from the classical herring gull through lesser black-backed gull. There are several other taxonomically unclear examples that belong in the same species complex, such as yellow-legged gull (&quot;L. michahellis&quot;), glaucous gull (&quot;L. hyperboreus&quot;), and Caspian gull (&quot;L. cachinnans&quot;).
*&quot;Pelophylax nigromaculatus&quot; and &quot;P. porosus/P. porosus brevipodus&quot; (the names and classification of these species have changed since the publication suggesting a ring species)
*&quot;Pernis ptilorhynchus&quot; and &quot;P. celebensis&quot;
*&quot;Perognathus amplus&quot; and &quot;P. longimembris&quot;
*&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;
*&quot;Phellinus&quot;
*&quot;Platycercus elegans&quot; (Crimson rosella) complex
*&quot;Drosophila paulistorum&quot;
*&quot;Phylloscopus collybita&quot; and &quot;P. sindianus&quot;
*&quot;Phylloscopus&quot; (Willow warblers)
*&quot;Powelliphanta&quot;
*&quot;Rhymogona silvatica&quot; and &quot;R. cervina&quot; (the names and classification of these species have changed since the publication suggesting a ring species)
*&quot;Melospiza melodia&quot;, a song sparrow, forms a ring around the Sierra Nevada of California with the subspecies &quot;heermanni&quot; and &quot;fallax&quot; meeting in the vicinity of the San Gorgonio Pass.
*&quot;Todiramphus chloris&quot; and &quot;T. cinnamominus&quot;

<text>They&#x27;re All Gonna Laugh at You! is the debut album by American actor and comedian Adam Sandler, released in 1993. The title comes from a repeated line in the track &quot;Oh Mom...&quot;, which is a parody of a scene in the film &quot;Carrie&quot;. Several of the tracks on the album feature adult humor, a departure from the material in his films, which were generally rated PG or PG-13. This is a trend that would continue on his subsequent comedy albums and live tours.

==Production==
At the time of the recording, Adam Sandler was in the middle of his five-season career at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and much of this album was made with the help of his friends from the show. Besides Sandler, the album features fellow &quot;SNL&quot; performers Rob Schneider, David Spade, Chris Farley, and Tim Meadows, as well as &quot;SNL&quot; writers Conan O&#x27;Brien, Robert Smigel, and career writing partner Tim Herlihy. The album was also produced by G. E. Smith, &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s musical director at the time. Several friends of Sandler&#x27;s also perform and co-write on the album, some of whom would go on to become recurring players in Sandler&#x27;s films, most notably Allen Covert.

In addition to several non-musical skits, the album includes five songs, two of which were performed live (and previously were performed on &quot;SNL&quot;: &quot;The Thanksgiving Song&quot; and &quot;Lunchlady Land&quot;) at The Strand in Redondo Beach, California on July 25, 1993, while &quot;Food Innuendo Guy&quot; is an uptempo George Thorogood meets Aerosmith-influenced blues rocker, &quot;At a Medium Pace&quot; is a sexually explicit love song, and &quot;My Little Chicken&quot; is a jazzy humorous number in which Sandler sings about his love for chickens.

==Reception==

The album was nominated for Best Comedy Album at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. It has been certified 2× platinum, having sold over two million copies.

As of 2014, sales in the United States have exceeded 1,831,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="980387" wikidata="Q878957" url="?curid=980387" title="Boxer briefs">
<text>Boxer briefs (sometimes spelled boxer-briefs or called tight boxers, also known as A-Fronts) are a hybrid type of men&#x27;s undergarment which are long in the leg, similar to boxer shorts, but tight-fitting like briefs. They emerged as a style in the 1990s and are commonly worn for sports and as every-day underwear.

==Etymology==
The term derives from the elasticated shorts worn by participants in the sport of boxing.

Boxer briefs are also called &quot;trunks&quot; in the United Kingdom and Australia.

==History==
Boxer briefs were once commonly thought to have been pioneered by designer John Varvatos during his 1990–1995 stint at Calvin Klein as head of menswear design. However, the style was available much earlier, as designed by Giorgio Armani and as worn by Richard Gere in the 1980 film &quot;American Gigolo&quot;. Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark &quot;Marky Mark&quot; Wahlberg, they have been called &quot;one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century&quot;. Of their creation Varvatos said in 2010, &quot;We just cut off a pair of long johns and thought, this could be cool...&quot;

== Design ==
The boxer brief design provides form-fitting coverage for the midsection from the waist to the thighs and are worn on the waist. They are usually made of a combination of cotton and spandex, polyester, or a soft, woven flannel material. Boxer brief designs can have either a keyhole fly, button (snap) front, pouch, or no fly at all. The waistband is usually a separate band of elastic material, often in a contrasting color to the main material. The elastic band often has the name of the manufacturer printed on it. There may also be additional elastic sewn around the bottom end of the thigh portion of the garment. Some boxer briefs have stitching on the rear to outline the buttocks and avoid a central seam. Boxer briefs are commonly used in athletics instead of, or in addition to, a jockstrap, but are common for everyday use as well.
A variant that reaches to the knee or near it is marketed by Jockey as &quot;midway briefs&quot;, and is also sold by other companies. Another variant are boxer briefs that have shorter leg sections than the standard type, called &quot;trunk briefs&quot; or &quot;trunks&quot;.

== Possible effect on male fertility ==
Some studies have suggested that tight underpants like boxer briefs and high temperature are not optimally conductive for sperm production. The testicles are outside the body for cooling because they operate for sperm production at a slightly lower temperature than the rest of the body, and boxer shorts allow the testicles to operate within the required temperature range. The compression of the genitals in boxer briefs, briefs, thongs, etc. may cause the temperature to rise and sperm production to fall. There is a similar theory regarding testicular cancer risk. Other sources dispute this theory. A study in the October 1998 &quot;Journal of Urology&quot;, for example, concluded that underwear type is unlikely to have a significant effect on male fertility.

Then (&quot;I&quot; : &quot;J&quot;) is itself an ideal in &quot;R&quot;. The ideal quotient is viewed as a quotient because formula_2 if and only if formula_3. The ideal quotient is useful for calculating primary decompositions. It also arises in the description of the set difference in algebraic geometry (see below).

(&quot;I&quot; : &quot;J&quot;) is sometimes referred to as a colon ideal because of the notation. In the context of fractional ideals, there is a related notion of the inverse of a fractional ideal.

==Properties==
The ideal quotient satisfies the following properties:
*formula_4 as formula_5-modules, where formula_6 denotes the annihilator of formula_7 as an formula_5-module.
*formula_9 (in particular, formula_10)
*formula_11
*formula_12
*formula_13
*formula_14
*formula_15 (as long as &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain)

==Calculating the quotient==
The above properties can be used to calculate the quotient of ideals in a polynomial ring given their generators. For example, if &quot;I&quot; = (&quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, &quot;f&quot;3) and &quot;J&quot; = (&quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2) are ideals in &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;], then
:formula_16

Then elimination theory can be used to calculate the intersection of &quot;I&quot; with (&quot;g&quot;1) and (&quot;g&quot;2):
:formula_17

Calculate a Gröbner basis for formula_18 with respect to lexicographic order. Then the basis functions which have no &quot;t&quot; in them generate formula_19.

==Geometric interpretation==
The ideal quotient corresponds to set difference in algebraic geometry. More precisely,
*If &quot;W&quot; is an affine variety (not necessarily irreducible) and &quot;V&quot; is a subset of the affine space (not necessarily a variety), then
::formula_20
:where formula_21 denotes the taking of the ideal associated to a subset.

*If &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are ideals in &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;], with &quot;k&quot; an algebraically closed field and &quot;I&quot; radical then
::formula_22

:where formula_23 denotes the Zariski closure, and formula_24 denotes the taking of the variety defined by an ideal. If &quot;I&quot; is not radical, then the same property holds if we saturate the ideal &quot;J&quot;:
::formula_25
:where formula_26.

== Examples ==
* In formula_27 we have formula_28.
* In algebraic number theory, the ideal quotient is useful while studying fractional ideals. This is because the inverse of any invertible fractional ideal formula_29 of an integral domain formula_5 is given by the ideal quotient formula_31.
* One geometric application of the ideal quotient is removing an irreducible component of an affine scheme. For example, let formula_32 in formula_33 be the ideals corresponding to the union of the x,y, and z-planes and x and y planes in formula_34. Then, the ideal quotient formula_35 is the ideal of the z-plane in formula_34. This shows how the ideal quotient can be used to &quot;delete&quot; irreducible subschemes.
* A useful scheme theoretic example is taking the ideal quotient of a reducible ideal. For example, the ideal quotient formula_37, showing that the ideal quotient of a subscheme of some non-reduced scheme, where both have the same reduced subscheme, kills off some of the non-reduced structure.
* We can use the previous example to find the &quot;saturation&quot; of an ideal corresponding to a projective scheme. Given a homogeneous ideal formula_38 the saturation of formula_29 is defined as the ideal quotient formula_40 where formula_41. It is a theorem that the set of saturated ideals of formula_42 contained in formula_43 is in bijection with the set of projective subschemes in formula_44. This shows us that formula_45 defines the same projective curve as formula_46 in formula_47.

<text>Public Forum Debate is a form of competitive debate where debaters use their evidence and impacts to outweigh the benefits and harms of the opposing side. The topics for public forum have to do with current-day events relating to public policy. Debaters work in pairs of two, and speakers alternate for every speech. It is primarily competed by middle and high school students, but college teams exist as well. Invented in the US, public forum is one of the most prominent American debate events, alongside Policy debate and Lincoln-Douglas debate; it is also practiced in China and India, and has been recently introduced to Romania. Individuals give short (2-4 minute) speeches that are interspersed with 3 minute &quot;Crossfire&quot; sections, questions and answers between opposed debaters. The winner is determined by a judge who also serves as a referee (timing sections, penalizing incivility, etc). The debate centers on affirming or rejecting a position, &quot;resolve&quot;, or &quot;resolution&quot;, which is usually a proposal of a potential solution to a current events issue. Public Forum is designed to be accessible to the average citizen.

== History ==
Public Forum debate was invented in 2002. It was initially called &quot;Ted Turner Debate&quot; for CNN founder Ted Turner. The &quot;crossfire&quot; period of PF is modeled after Crossfire (U.S. TV program), a political debate show on CNN.

=== Comparisons to other debate forms ===
Public Forum debate is often described as more accessible than policy debate. Unlike policy, which has one topic per year, PF debate topics switch every month or every two months and are based on current events. In policy debate, participants tend to &quot;spread&quot;, or speak very fast, something that is less common in PF, making PF more understandable to the average &quot;lay&quot;, or non-debating person.

Lincoln-Douglas debate tends to focus on philosophical questions, in contrast to PF.

Parliamentary debate is much less structured than PF, and participants are not made aware of their topics until 15–20 minutes before their round, giving them little time to research, gather evidence, and prepare their arguments. In Public Forum, topics are decided prior the month starting, giving debaters plenty of time to research and prepare.

=== Debate structure ===
A Public Forum debate consists of 8 speeches and 3 crossfires, each with a time limit.
==== Constructive speeches (4 minutes) ====
The first speech, also known as a case, is pre-written and presents the team&#x27;s &quot;contentions,&quot; arguments either supporting or opposing the resolution. These contentions are backed up by warrants, evidence in the form of quotes, or citations from sources.

The two speakers from each team who presented cases then participate in a 3-minute crossfire. The first speaker asks the first question in the crossfire, and the rest of the crossfire consists of each speaker asking their opponent questions.

==== Rebuttal speeches (4 minutes) ====
The first rebuttal speaker refutes the constructive speech for the opposite side (that is, the second constructive speech). Parts of this case are sometimes pre-written and are known as &quot;answers to&quot; (A/2s or ATs) or &quot;blocks&quot;.

The second refutation speaker refutes the first constructive speaker, but must also defend the arguments of the second constructive speaker, which have just been refuted by the first refutation speaker.

The two speakers then engage in crossfire.

==== Summary speeches (3 minutes) ====
The summary speech, given by the 2 first speakers, is given to both reinforce arguments and to refute their opponents, as well as to try and tell the judge which points the debate should be judged on. The summary is often referred to as the most important speech. Competitors &quot;weigh&quot; their points in comparison to their opponents to explain why it is more important through the framework of scope, magnitude, prerequisite, etc.)

The summary speeches are followed by the grand crossfire, a crossfire between all speakers.

==== Final foci/focuses (2 minutes) ====
The final focus, given by the second speakers, is 2 minutes and is used to explain to the judge why the speaker&#x27;s team should win the debate. Debaters are not allowed to bring up new material in final focus.

=== Preparation time ===
&quot;Prep&quot; time differs from tournament to tournament. The most common amount of prep in a debate are 3 minutes. This prep time can be taken in between speeches or at other times, but some tournaments or leagues may have rules about when prep time is allowed to be taken. Each team may use the other team&#x27;s prep time for their preparation, however, the time is only taken from the team that decided to take prep time. Strategically, most teams do prep when the other team is prepping to maximize their own prep time. Though it is not common practice, some national tournaments give teams additional prep time. For example, the Yale Invitational Debate Tournament provides both teams with 4 minutes of prep time.

== Topics ==
Topics are presented as resolutions, meaning they advocate for solving a problem by the means of a certain position. Resolution options and official topics are released by the National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) on their website. Competitors are encouraged to focus on the &quot;main issues&quot; of the topic rather than search for obscure arguments. The resolution changes frequently and focuses on current events. Some topics spread the length of two months, while others rotate monthly.

<text>A suite is the location of a business within a shopping mall or office building. The suite&#x27;s number also serves as a sort of address within an address for purposes of mail delivery and pickup.

Some commercial mail receiving agencies may also use the &#x27;suite&#x27; designator to indicate a company&#x27;s private post-office box by listing it as a suite rather than a post-office box, though by order of the United States Postal Inspection Service, most of the major CMRA companies such as The UPS Store/Mail Boxes Etc. have drawn this down as the result of mail fraud where unscrupulous businesses who count on their targets not researching their addresses market a post-office box &#x27;suite&#x27; or virtual office as an actual office location with personnel.

In the US, suite can be abbreviated &quot;STE&quot; or &quot;Ste&quot; in postal addresses.

<doc id="980399" wikidata="Q363183" url="?curid=980399" title="Osei Bonsu">
<text>Osei Bonsu (born 1779 – 21 January 1824) also known as Osei Tutu Kwame was the Asantehene (King of the Ashanti). He reigned either from 1800 to 1824 or from 1804 to 1824. During his reign as the king, the Ashanti fought the Fante confederation and ended up dominating Gold Coast trade. In Akan, Bonsu means whale (the largest and most powerful &quot;fish&quot; in the sea), and is symbolic of his achievement of extending the Ashanti Empire to the coast. He died in Kumasi, and was succeeded by Osei Yaw Akoto.

Other sources refer to him as Osei Tutu Kwame. He was a leader in war against the Fante of the southern Gold Coast in 1806–07 and against Gyaman in 1818–19.
He halted British expansionism in the Gold Coast region.

== Reign ==
Early in his reign, the king suppressed a rebellion in the North-West provinces that was carried out by Muslim subjects who wanted to restore Osei Kwame Panyin to office possibly because the former Asantehene was pro-Muslim. This rebellion was led by the Gbuipewura of Gonja in the early 19th century. The rebels were defeated around 1801 with the Gbuipewura either captured or killed. 

An Annal was written in Arabic by Muhammad al-Mustafa from Gonja on the history of the ruling Oyoko dynasty, sponsored by Bonsu during his reign. The document does not exist today but it was partly reviewed by Joseph Dupuis in 1820. During his era, the interest rate on loans for capital was set at 33% for 42 days. 

=== Infrastructure Projects ===

Thomas Edward Bowdich noted Osei Bonsu&#x27;s interest in English architecture. In the early 19th century, Osei Bonsu began the construction of the Aban Palace funded by the public treasury. A new town plan was conceived. Houses along the main road which served as the link between the suburbs of Bantama and Asafo were to be rebuilt. He also had laborers construct a wide straight street from the city of Kumasi to the village of Breman on the Mampong road. Bonsu&#x27;s city plan was to destroy the villages in the neighborhood and rehouse the people along this street. 

In 1816, the King commenced the reconstruction of the 6th and 7th Great Roads where they were cut within the width of 30 – 40 feet; further straightened and weeded. Works on the 7th Great Road progressed but reconstructions on the 6th Great Road were stalled until 1820 where Bonsu spoke of restarting the project. Reconstruction of the 1st Great Road took place in 1819 and by 1820, the renovated 7th Great Road, leading to Elmina – was believed to be the fastest route to the coast taking one day to journey to the Coast from Ashanti.

Bonsu incorporated literate Muslims into the Ashanti bureaucracy. These &quot;Moors,&quot; as documented by European visitors to Ashanti in the early 19th century, originated from the north of Ashanti among the states of Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprussi. A Muslim school was established by Al-Ghamba, the head of the Kumasi muslim community, in the early 19th century which Bonsu sent some of his children to attend. By 1819, the school had accommodated 70 students. Muller adds that Bonsu was the patron of the school which he took advantage to check against the growth of Isam in Ashanti. Muller also explains that Bonsu sent his children to the school as a sign of respect to the Muslim community and not to acknowledge the growth of Islam in the state.

=== Military ===
British primary sources in the early 19th century referred to an &quot;Arab medical staff&quot; whose services were employed in Ashanti army by Osei Bonsu. They were tasked with the function of recording Ashanti casualties in battle. This unit was deployed in a campaign against Fante states in 1807 for example.

==== Campaigns ====
Historian Edgerton recounts the origin of Bonsu&#x27;s conflict with the British and Fante. He explains that a relative of a tributary Asen chief called Aputai was charged for grave robbery after they were sued by the victim. Aputai was charged by the Ashanti court led by the Asantehene to pay restitution on behalf of the defendant relative but Aputai attacked the victim of the grave robbery. Osei Bonsu sent emissaries to Aputai&#x27;s court which Edgerton states that its purpose was to convince Aputai to cease hostilities and pay restitution according to Ashanti law. Aputai murdered the emissaries causing Osei Bonsu to lead an army and attack the jurisdiction of Aputai. Aputai and another rebellious Assen chief sought refuge among the Fante. McCaskie on the other hand writes that the Fante states provided refuge for three rebellious Ashanti subjects from Asen in the late 1790s. Both Edgerton and McCaskie report that Osei Bonsu assembled a series of diplomatic envoys to the Fante states to secure the release of these subjects although McCaskie specifies that it was to the state of Abora in the year 1805. The final group of envoys, according to McCaskie were put to death by the Fante state of Abora. This resulted in the declaration of war against the Fante by Bonsu in 1806 and by May 1806, the Fante state of Abora fell to Ashanti conquests. The fugitives fled to Cape Coast to escape the Ashanti army. 

In June 1807, the Dutch fort at Kormantin &quot;was surrendered to Asante.&quot; A British fort at Anomabu led by British governor Torrane provided shelter to escaping Fante affected by the Ashanti invasion of the town in 1807. Edgerton adds that Torrane also protected the fugitives who fled from Ashanti pursuit. The Ashanti army attacked the fort resulting in its surrender. On 16 June, British sources documented that 8000 out of the estimated 1500 Fante at Anomabu were slain as a result of the invasion. The surviving Fante leaders of Bonsu&#x27;s conquest swore allegiance to the Asantehene as the Fante states were conquered into the Ashanti Empire. The Asantehene clarified, as stated by McCaskie, that he &quot;had no quarrel with the Europeans but only attacked Anomabo fort because it sheltered his enemies and his rebel subjects&quot;. Torrane and Osei Bonsu resolved their differences in a diplomatic meeting on 25 June. 

Since 1811, the province of Gyaman had revolted against Ashanti rule. After failed negotiations between the Ashanti government and Gyaman authorities, the Council of Kumasi met on 6 November 1817 where it was agreed on a military reoccupation of Gyaman. On 23 November, this decision by the Council of Kumasi was approved by the Asantemanhyiamu. Asantehene Bonsu led an invasion of Gyaman from 1818–19. As stated by Wilks, the Gyaman cavalry gave the strongest resistance but the state was conquered by 1818. From the early 19th century, the Ashanti government solidified its rule in the province.

== Foreign relations ==

As a result of the conquest of the Fante states by 1816, the Ashanti exerted power over the coast of modern Ghana. This attracted European diplomats to the court of Osei Bonsu with the aim of improving relations with Ashanti. As listed by historian Irwin, between 1816 and 1820 the Ashanti court received Willem Huydecoper (in 1816), Frederick James and Thomas Edward Bowdich with William Hutchinson and Henry Tedlie (in 1817), as well as Joseph Dupuis and William Hutton with Francis Collins, Benjamin Salmon, and David Mill Graves (in 1820). The &quot;five years&#x27; peace&quot; occurred under Osei Bonsu from 1801 to 1806. As noted by Joseph Dupuis in 1820, this was a period of peace and stability with ambassadors visiting Osei Bonsu at Kumasi from &quot;Abomey, (circa 1802 ), Salgha and Yendy&quot; bearing honourable presents and congratulatory messages to the king.

<text>A suite in a hotel or other public accommodation (e.g. a cruise ship) denotes, according to most dictionary definitions, connected rooms under one room number. Hotels may refer to suites as a class of accommodations with more space than a typical hotel room, but technically speaking there should be more than one room to constitute a true suite.

In luxury or upscale accommodations, such as Ritz Carlton, InterContinental, Marriott, Westin, Four Seasons, Shangri-La or St. Regis, key features may include multiple rooms. Many independent properties have one or more honeymoon suites. The most luxurious accommodation in a hotel is often called the presidential suite or royal suite.

Upper-midscale accommodations, such as Comfort Suites, Hampton Inn &amp; Suites, and Candlewood Suites, may denote suites as one room with more space and furniture than a standard hotel room, and so technically these would not be considered suites of rooms per se. In addition to one or more beds and a bathroom, such &quot;suites&quot; include a living or sitting area, often equipped with a sofa bed. Dining, office and kitchen facilities are also added in many of these &quot;suites.&quot; Some chains, such as Staybridge Suites and Home2 Suites by Hilton, offer only suites, which often cater to business travelers who appreciate additional space and may use it to host small meetings or entertain clients.

==Bridal and honeymoon suites==

As a form of niche marketing, hôteliers occasionally offer premium rooms with specialised amenities aimed at couples or newlyweds. 

While Niagara Falls had branded itself &quot;the honeymoon capital of the world&quot; as early as the railway era of the late 1800s, its first tentative promotion of campground &quot;honeymoon huts&quot; dates to the 1920s. The &quot;honeymoon suite&quot; pattern of multiple destinations offering bridal suites with heart-shaped tubs is a more modern one, which grew in the post-World War II era of aeroplanes and motorcar travel.

The presence of special &quot;honeymoon suites&quot; or &quot;romance suites&quot; marketed to couples, newlyweds or &quot;second honeymooners&quot; is widespread, appearing not only in hotel/motel or resort accommodation, but also aboard cruise ships.

<text>Adventure Vision is a cartridge-based video game console released by Entex Industries in either August or October 1982. The launch price of the system was $79.95. The monitor, game controls, and computer hardware are all contained within a single portable unit. The LED monitor can only display red pixels. Four games were released, all of which are arcade ports. Approximately 10,000 were produced.

Adventure Vision was Entex&#x27;s second-generation system following the Entex Select-A-Game, released a year earlier in 1981.

==Description==
Control is through a single multi-position joystick and two sets of four buttons, one on each side of the joystick, for ease of play by both left- and right-handed players. Rather than using an LCD screen or an external television set like other systems of the time, the Adventure Vision uses a single vertical line of 40 red LEDs combined with a spinning mirror inside the casing. This allows for an effective screen resolution of 150 × 40 pixels. The mirror motor draws a great deal of power from the batteries, which can be avoided by using the built-in AC adapter.

==Games==
Entex released four Adventure Vision games, all of them ported from arcades:

*&quot;Defender&quot;, originally by Williams Electronics
*&quot;Super Cobra&quot;, originally by Konami
*&quot;Turtles&quot;, originally by Konami
*&quot;Space Force&quot;, originally by Venture Line (similar to &quot;Asteroids&quot;)

== Technical specifications ==
* CPU: Intel 8048 @ 733 kHz
* Sound: National Semiconductor COP411L @ 52.6 kHz, headphone jack
* RAM: 64 bytes (internal to 8048), 1K (on main PCB)
* ROM: 1K (internal to 8048), 512 bytes (internal to COP411L), 4K (cartridge)
* Input: 4 direction joystick, 4 buttons duplicated on each side of the joystick
* Graphics: 150x40 monochrome red pixels
* Expansion port
* Dimensions: 

== Legacy ==
A similar display technique combining red LEDs with a moving mirror was used by Nintendo in the 1995 Virtual Boy.

Because of the moving parts used by the system, many units no longer work, with an estimated 100 known operational units left.

On March 31, 2013 at the Revision demoparty, the first-ever homebrew/demo ROM for the system was demonstrated by MEGA - Museum of Electronic Games &amp; Art. MEGA also released the source code for the demo as well as all development tools.

The system is supported by the MESS emulator and AdViEmulator.

<doc id="980415" wikidata="Q1315810" url="?curid=980415" title="Mexican Texas">
<text>Mexican Texas is the historiographical name used to refer to the era of Texan history between 1821 and 1836, when it was part of Mexico. Mexico gained independence in 1821 after winning its war against Spain, which began in 1810. Initially, Mexican Texas operated similarly to Spanish Texas. Ratification of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico created a federal structure, and the province of Tejas was joined with the province of Coahuila to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas.

In 1821, approximately 3,500 settlers lived in the whole of Tejas, concentrated mostly in San Antonio and La Bahia, although authorities had tried to encourage development along the frontier. The settler population was overwhelmingly outnumbered by indigenous people in the province. To increase the number of settlers, Mexico enacted the General Colonization Law in 1824, which enabled all heads of household, regardless of race, religion or immigrant status, to acquire land in Mexico.

The first empresarial grant had been made under Spanish control to Stephen F. Austin, whose settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, settled along the Brazos River in 1822. The grant was later ratified by the Mexican government. Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority coming from the American South, while only one colony was settled by Mexican nationals, and two by European immigrants.

Mexico officials became concerned about attitudes among the Anglo-Americans in Tejas; for instance, their insistence on bringing slaves into the territory. The legislature passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which prohibited further immigration by U.S. citizens. The government established several new presidios in the region to monitor immigration and customs practices. Angry colonists held a convention in 1832 to demand that U.S. citizens be allowed to immigrate to Tejas. At a convention the following year, colonists proposed that Texas become a separate Mexican state. Although Mexico implemented several measures to appease the colonists, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna&#x27;s measures to transform Mexico from a federalist to a centralist state appeared to be the catalyst for the Anglo-Texan colonists to revolt.

The first violent incident occurred on June 26, 1832, at the Battle of Velasco. On March 2, 1836, Texians declared their independence from Mexico. The Texas Revolution ended on April 21, 1836, when Santa Anna was taken prisoner by Texians following the Battle of San Jacinto. Although Texas declared its independence as the Republic of Texas, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as a new country.

==Mexican independence==
In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain after the brutal and destructive Mexican War for Independence. Its territory included much of the former New Spain, including Spanish Texas. The victorious rebels issued a provisional constitution, the Plan de Iguala. This plan reaffirmed many of the ideals of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and granted equal citizenship rights to all races.

Initially, there was disagreement over whether Mexico should be a federal republic or a monarchy. The first monarch, Agustín I, abdicated in March 1823. The following month the citizens of San Antonio de Bexar established a governing committee for the province of Texas consisting of seven representatives from San Antonio, one from La Bahia, and one from Nacogdoches. In July, a new national provisional government named Luciano Garcia as the political chief of Texas. On November 27, 1823, the people of Mexico elected congressional representatives and set out to create a new constitution. Texas was represented in congress by Erasmo Seguin. A new Mexican constitution was adopted on October 4, 1824, making the country a federal republic with nineteen states and four territories. The constitution was modelled on the constitution of the United States of America, but the Mexican constitution made Roman Catholicism the official, and only, religion of the country.

Because it was sparsely populated, Texas was combined with Coahuila to create the state of Coahuila y Tejas. Texas had originally asked to become a territory if its statehood claim was denied, but after realizing that states controlled their own public lands, while as a territory public land would be controlled by the national government, Seguin chose not to request territorial status. The Congress did allow Texas the option of forming its own state &quot;&#x27;as soon as it feels capable of doing so.&#x27;&quot; The new state, the poorest in the Mexican federation, covered the boundaries of Spanish Texas but did not include the area around El Paso, which belonged to the state of Chihuahua and the area of Laredo, Texas, which became part of Tamaulipas. The capital of Texas moved from San Antonio to Monclova and then to Saltillo. Along with the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, Coahuila y Tejas was under a unified military organization. With the formation of a new state government, the Texas provincial governing committee was forced to disband. Many Tejanos were reluctant to give up their self-rule.

The 1824 constitution dismantled the mission system, requiring missions more than ten years old to be converted into parishes, while newer missions would be given until 1842 to become secularized. Most of the missions had been secularized before the 1820s, and only Missions Refugio, Espiritu Santo and Rosario were not currently secularized. By 1830, these missions had been converted into parishes, and most of the mission Natives moved to other settlements in Texas. As the missions were secularized, the mission lands were distributed amongst the Natives, who would later be taxed on the profits.

The new Mexican government was bankrupt and had little money to devote to the military. Settlers were empowered to create their own militias to help control hostile Native American tribes. Texas faced raids from both the Apache and Comanche tribes, and with little military support the few settlers in the region needed help. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the government liberalized its immigration policies for the region for the first time, and settlers from the United States were permitted in the colonies for the first time.

==Immigration==

In the late 18th century, Spain had stopped allocating new parcels of land in San Antonio and La Bahia, making it difficult for some families to accommodate their growth. Occupancy rights were granted to people in the northeast part of Texas, but the new residents had no official ownership of the land on which they lived. Just before Mexico achieved independence, Spain reversed its policies and passed a colonization law. Although the law did not state a religious requirement for settlers in Texas, it was understood that Spain&#x27;s only religion was Catholicism, per the 1812 Constitution. Notably, article 28 of this law prohibited the importation of slaves into Spanish territories, and if brought to the area, they would be freed. Mexico adopted a similar law in 1824. The General Colonization Law enabled all heads of household who were citizens of or immigrants to Mexico to be eligible to claim land. The law did not differentiate among races or social stature, and people who had been granted occupancy rights would be able to claim the land patent for the dwellings. Unlike its predecessor, the Mexican law required immigrants to practice Catholicism and stressed that foreigners needed to learn Spanish. Settlers were supposed to own property or have a craft or useful profession, and all people wishing to live in Texas were expected to report to the nearest Mexican authority for permission to settle. The rules were widely disregarded and many families became squatters.

As soon as the national colonization law was passed, approval for settlement contracts for Texas was the responsibility of the state government in Saltillo. They were soon besieged by foreign speculators wanting to bring colonists into the state. Coahuila y Tejas implemented the federal law in 1825. At this time, about 3500 people lived in Texas, mostly congregated at San Antonio and La Bahia. Under the new law, people who did not already possess property in Texas could claim one square league (4438 acres) of irrigable land, with an additional league available to those who owned cattle. Soldiers were given first choice of land, followed by citizens and immigrants. Empresarios and individuals with large families were exempt from the limit. Those who had owned land under Spanish control were allowed to retain their property as long as they had not fought on the side of the Spanish during the Mexican War of Independence. Immigrants were subject to the same policies as Mexican citizens, and Native Americans who migrated to Texas after Mexican independence and were not indigenous to the area would be treated as immigrants.

Approximately 3420 land grant applications were submitted by immigrants and naturalized citizens, many of them Anglo-Americans. The first group of colonists, known as the Old Three Hundred, arrived in 1822 to settle an empresarial grant that had been given to Stephen F. Austin by the Spanish. The group settled along the Brazos River, ranging from the near present-day Houston to Dallas. Shortly after they arrived, Austin learned that the new Mexican government had not ratified his father&#x27;s land grant with Spain. He was forced to travel to Mexico City, 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away, to get permission for his colony. During his time in the capitol, Austin impressed various important people in the government by offering to draw a map of Texas, to help remove sediment obstructing navigation of the Colorado River, and by promising to carry out an Indian pacification campaign. On February 18, 1823, ten months after Austin arrived in Mexico City, Agustin I approved his colonization contract. One month later, Agustin abdicated as emperor, and the newly created republican congress nullified all acts of his government, including Austin&#x27;s colonization contract. Many of Austin&#x27;s new friends in Mexico praised his integrity before the congress, and his contract was re-approved in mid-April. On his return to Texas in July 1823, Austin established San Felipe de Austin as the new headquarters for his colony.
There was no shortage of people willing to come to Texas. The United States was still struggling with the aftermath of the Panic of 1819, and soaring land prices within the United States made the Mexican land policy seem very generous. In 1827 Austin received a second grant allowing him to settle 100 families along the Old San Antonio Road to Nacogdoches, near what is now Bastrop. The location was chosen at the behest of the Tejanos, who hoped that colonists in that area could help defend against Comanche raids. Austin was later granted permission to resettle 800 other families in Texas. Twenty-three other empresarios also brought immigrants to Texas. Of these, only one of the empresarios, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States. Many of the Anglo settlers owned slaves. All colonists were expected to become naturalized Mexican citizens, and they were also supposed to follow the state religion. In Austin&#x27;s colony, the local priest formally converted new arrivals but then allowed them to worship as they pleased.

Austin was granted the rank of lieutenant colonel of the militia, and he was given absolute authority over all justice, excluding the sentencing for capital crimes. To maintain order within his colony, he issued the first Anglo-American law code in Texas. His &quot;Instructions and Regulations for the Alcades&quot; was issued January 22, 1824. It comprised a penal code and codes of criminal and civil procedure. The instructions authorized the creation of sheriff and constable offices and established a rudimentary court system. It relied on English common law concepts for defining criminal behavior and also established punishments for vices that Austin deemed disruptive, such as gambling, profane swearing, and public drunkenness.

Under the terms of the colonization contracts, the empresarios were responsible for providing security within their lands. In 1823 Austin created a company of men who would patrol his colony and protect the colonists from Native attacks and to defuse internal issues. The initial company, known as Ranger Company, comprised 10 volunteers who served terms of 3–6 months and were paid in land. The men were not uniformed and were not subject to military law or regulation. They were the precursors to the Texas Rangers. After the Karankawa repeatedly attacked the settlers, Austin organized a militia to fight back; they almost annihilated the tribe.

Comanches were a threat to some of the colonies. Green Dewitt began his colony west of Austin&#x27;s in December 1825. In July 1826 his headquarters, Gonzales, was burned to the ground in a Comanche attack. All but one colonist escaped to San Felipe. They returned to rebuild their colony the following year. For protection, the political chief of the region granted the community a small cannon.

Land speculators flooded into Texas. Colonization laws limited Anglos to only one league of land, but Mexican nationals were in many cases eligible for up to 11 leagues. Anglo speculators would often convince a Mexican national to claim his 11 leagues and then sell the land to the speculator through a power of attorney.

==Rising tensions==

In 1825, Mexican authorities became concerned with the actions of empresario Haden Edwards in Nacogdoches. Edwards had threatened to confiscate the land of any Mexican already living in the area in which he planned to bring settlers unless the Mexicans could present written deeds to the property. Mexican authorities promptly told him that he did not have the authority to confiscate land and he should honor the claims of the previous settlers. After multiple confrontations, on December 16, 1826, Edwards, his brothers, and 30 settlers issued a declaration of independence and called themselves the Republic of Fredonia. Other empresarios disassociated themselves from Edwards, and Austin sent 250 militiamen to Nacogdoches to help the Mexican forces quell the revolt. Edwards was finally forced to flee Mexican territory.

After hearing reports of other racial issues, the Mexican government asked General Manuel Mier y Teran to investigate the outcome of the 1825 colonization law in Texas. In 1829, Mier y Teran issued his report, which concluded that most Anglo Americans refused to be naturalized and tried to isolate themselves from Mexicans. He also noted that slave reforms passed by the state were being ignored.

Although many Mexicans wanted to abolish slavery, fears of an economic crisis if all of the slaves were simultaneously freed led to a gradual emancipation policy. In 1823, Mexico forbade the sale or purchase of slaves and required that the children of slaves be freed when they reached fourteen. Any slave introduced into Mexico by purchase or trade would also be freed. By 1825, however, a census of Austin&#x27;s Colony showed 1,347 Anglo-Americans and 443 people of African descent, including a very small number of free African Americans. Two years later the legislature of Coahuila y Tejas outlawed the introduction of additional slaves into the state and granted freedom at birth to all children born to a slave. The new laws also stated that any slave brought into Texas should be freed within six months.

In 1829, slavery was officially outlawed in Mexico. Austin feared that the edict would cause widespread discontent and tried to suppress publication of it. Rumors of the new law quickly spread throughout the area and the colonists seemed on the brink of revolt. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Jose Maria Viesca, wrote to the president to explain the importance of slavery to the Texas economy, and the importance of the Texas economy to the development of the state. Texas was temporarily exempted from the rule. On April 6, 1830, Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante ordered Texas to comply with the emancipation proclamation or face military intervention. To circumvent the law, many Anglo colonists converted their slaves into indentured servants for life. Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status. Slaveholders wishing to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt. The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen. This tactic was outlawed by an 1832 state law which prohibited worker contracts from lasting more than ten years. A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the West Indies or Africa. The British consul estimated that in the 1830s approximately 500 slaves had been illegally imported into Texas. By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.

Exportation in the slave-owning areas of the state surpassed that of the non-slave-owning areas. A survey of Texas in 1834 found that the department of Bexar, which was mostly made up of Tejanos, had exported no goods. The Brazos department, including Austin&#x27;s colonies and those of Green DeWitt, had exported 600,000 pesos worth of goods, including 5,000 bales of cotton. The department of Texas, which included the eastern settlements, expected to export 2,000 bales of cotton and 5,000 head of cattle.

Bustamante implemented other measures to make immigration less desirable for Anglo-Americans. He rescinded the property tax law, which had exempted immigrants from paying taxes for ten years. He further increased tariffs on goods entering Mexico from the United States, causing their prices to rise. The 1830s laws also brought settlement contracts under federal rather than state control. Colonies that did not have at least 150 inhabitants would be canceled. Among the affected colonies were the Nashville Company run by Sterling C. Robertson and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company, run by David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Joseph Vehlein. Finally, he prohibited further immigration to Texas from the United States, although Anglos would still be welcome in other parts of Mexico. The ban and other measures did not stop U.S. citizens from migrating illegally to Texas by the thousands. By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000 Anglos lived in Texas, compared to only 7,800 Mexicans.

Anglos often viewed the Mexicans as foreigners and intruders. The feeling was often returned; Rafael Antonio Manchola, son-in-law of empresario Martín De León, served as the commander of the presidio at La Bahia from 1828 to 1830 and then as the alcalde of Goliad. He warned the military commander for Texas that
&quot;&#x27;No faith can be placed in the Anglo-American colonists because they are continually demonstrating that they absolutely refuse to be subordinate, unless they find it convenient to what they want anyway, all of which I believe will be very detrimental to us for them to be our neighbors if we do not in time, clip the wings of their audacity by stationing a strong detachment in each new settlement which will enforce the laws and jurisdiction of a Mexican magistrate which should be placed in each of them, since under their own colonists as judges, they do nothing more than practice their own laws which they have practiced since they were born, forgetting the ones they have sworn to obey, these being the laws of our Supreme Government.&#x27;&quot;
==International issues==
Many Americans thought the United States had been cheated out of Texas. American land speculators believed they could make fortunes in the vast region of Texas, and American politicians believed Texas could help maintain a balance of power between free and slave states. In 1827, American president John Quincy Adams offered US$1 million for Texas. Mexican president Guadalupe Victoria refused. Two years later, Andrew Jackson increased the United States&#x27; offer to $5 million; President Vicente Guerrero again declined to sell.

In July 1829, Mexican authorities had other concerns, as General Isidro Barradas landed 2,700 Spanish troops to the eastern coast of Mexico, near Tampico in an attempt to reclaim the country for Spain. At the request of the government, Austin mustered a local militia to help defend Texas if the invasion were to reach the northern regions of the country. Yucatan governor Antonio López de Santa Anna led a force of Mexican troops to halt the invasion. Barradas surrendered as his troops suffered greatly from tropical diseases, and Santa Anna was hailed as a hero. During the invasion, the Mexican Congress had granted war powers to President Guerrero, making him essentially a monarch. This alarmed the Anglo colonists in Texas, who were accustomed to a separation of powers.

==Precursor to revolt==

Mier y Teran&#x27;s 1828 report had recommended new garrisons in Texas which could oversee the Anglo colonists and encourage Mexicans to resettle in the area. The new garrisons were to be partly staffed by convicts. The first was established along Galveston Bay in 1831 at the site of present-day Anahuac. It became the first port in Texas to collect customs. A second custom port, Velasco, was established at the mouth of the Brazos River, while a third garrison established Fort Teran on the Neches River below Nacogdoches to combat smuggling and illegal immigration.

Mier y Teran further ordered the garrison at Bexar to abandon their fort and create a new presidio. Fort Tenoxtitlán was established in 1830 on the west bank of the Brazos River, above San Felipe. Shortly after the fort was completed, 50 immigrants from Tennessee arrived in the area under empresario Sterling C. Robertson. The settlers had arrived illegally, as Robertson&#x27;s contract had been invalidated by Guerrero&#x27;s 1830 laws. The garrison commander chose not to expel them, instead sending to Mexico for advice. Three months later he received instructions to expel the settlers immediately. He chose not to do so, allowing the Robertson&#x27;s Colony to be saved. The fort closed in 1832. After having received no replacements or supplies, the commander finally ordered all of the soldiers to return to San Antonio.

Anahuac was placed under the control of Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn. Bradburn enforced the 1830 laws strictly, angering many colonists. He forbade the state commissioner from granting property titles to squatters and insisted on enforcing the law freeing any slave who set foot in Mexican territory. He and his men also confiscated settlers goods for their own personal wealth. This angered many of the Anglos, believing that their rights under the Mexican Constitution of 1824 were being violated. In 1832, local men organized a militia, supposedly to protect the settlement from Indian attacks, although all Indians in the area were peaceful. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, Patrick C. Jack. Citizens were very angry. In Brazoria, residents held a town meeting to decide what to do. William H. Wharton complained that there was little support within Austin&#x27;s colony to oppose Bradburn with military force; he and other advocates of armed conflict felt that their opposition from other settlers was as deep as that of the Mexican soldiers in the area. Bradburn eventually agreed to release Jack, and tensions cooled for a brief period.

In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter, ostensibly from a friend, warning that 100 armed men were stationed away, intent on reclaiming runaway slaves held by Bradburn. When Bradburn realized that the letter was a hoax, he arrested William Barret Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection, with the goal being separation from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would certainly lead to Travis&#x27;s execution. The settlers were outraged that the arrest did not require a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most were unfamiliar with Mexican law and assumed that the United States Bill of Rights still applied to them.
Settlers attacked the Anahuac garrison to free Travis in an event that became known as the Anahuac Disturbances.

Additional settlers had gathered in Brazoria to transport several cannon to aid the group in Anahuac. Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, who led the garrison at Velasco, at the mouth of the Brazos River, refused to allow the ship carrying the cannon to pass. On June 26, settlers initiated the Battle of Velasco; Ugartechea surrendered the following day.

Several days later, Colonel Jose de las Piedras arrived from Nacogdoches to assist Bradburn. He removed Bradburn from his command, and the settlers dispersed.

In 1832, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led an insurrection against Mexican president Bustamante. Although most of the Mexican Army supported the Bustamante administration, this led to a small civil war. Many of the Anglo settlers sided with Santa Anna and followed General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers in Texas against Bustamante. Mexia removed the commander at Matamoros from his post. In October, 55 delegates from Texas communities attended the Convention of 1832 in San Felipe. The delegates drafted three petitions to the Congress of Mexico. They wished for an annulment of Article 11 of the colonization law of 1830 (which prohibited foreign settlement as well as customs reform), recognition of squatters as valid immigrants, and a separate state for Texas.

On December 19, 1832, the Bexar Remonstrance was issued to the Mexican Congress. It legally proclaimed the grievances that the population of Texas had suffered under the centralist style Mexican government. It addressed such issues as improper protection against Indian attacks and poor pay for militia, insufficient local and legislative representation, forbidding of immigration from the United States, lack of schools and funding for education, and various violations of the repudiated republican style Constitution of 1824.

Santa Anna was elected the president of Mexico on January 19, 1833. A resulting second convention was held that year in April. This one, attended by recent arrivals such as Sam Houston, appointed a commission to draft a constitution for a new Mexican state of Texas and selected delegates to represent Texas before the federal government. Austin was chosen to deliver the proposed constitution to Santa Anna&#x27;s government in Mexico City. Although Austin pointed out that Texas had been given permission to form a separate state and had now grown to 46,500 inhabitants, the political chief of Bexar warned the government that the Anglos might be proposing separate statehood as part of a plan to join with the United States. Austin was arrested on November 21, 1833, on suspicion of treason. Austin was imprisoned for about a year. Santa Anna decided to do away with the Mexican Constitution of 1824 and became a monarch. At this point, Austin switched from promoting peace to supporting separation from Mexico.

The Mexican government attempted to address some of the Texans&#x27; concerns. Article 11 was repealed on November 21, 1833, allowing American immigrants to again flow into Texas. Five months later, Coahuila y Tejas separated Texas into three departments, San Antonio-Bexar, Brazos, and Nacogdoches, with political chiefs for each department and more representation in the state legislature. Furthermore, trial by jury was introduced, and English was authorized as a second language. An Anglo American, Jefferson Chambers, was appointed superior circuit judge of Texas in 1835 and extensions were granted for settlement contracts that had not met their conditions for the number of settlers. Six English-speaking Texan communities were elevated to municipalities.

In March 1833, the capital of the state was transferred from Saltillo to Monclova. The following year, centralists began urging Santa Anna to overturn the federal system and introduce centralism. Some legislators believed that centralism would be the only way to retain Texas, as newspapers in the United States continued to make statements about the forthcoming annexation of Texas. When the national congress attempted to centralize the nation, a civil war ensued. As fighting erupted, Saltillo declared that Monclova had been illegally made the state capitol and selected its own governor. Texans in Saltillo recommended establishing a provisional government in Bexar during the unrest to strengthen the autonomy of Texas. Juan Seguin, political chief of Bexar, called for a town meeting to create a government but was forced to postpone it when news arrived of approaching Mexican troops.

By the end of the year, however, Santa Anna began to exhibit centralist tendencies, and in 1835 he revoked the Constitution of 1824 and began consolidating his power. In various parts of the country federalists revolted, and in May 1835 Santa Anna brutally crushed a revolt in Zacatecas; over 2,000 noncombatants were killed. The federalists, including Agustín Viesca, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas, were afraid that Santa Anna would march against Coahuila after subduing the rebels in Zacatecas, so they disbanded the state legislature on May 21, 1835, and authorized the governor to set up an office in a different part of the state. Viezca was arrested as he traveled to San Antonio. Under the pretext of being angry over Viezca&#x27;s imprisonment the people of Anahuac organized a resistance under Travis. Their real grievance was that the two-year grace period on tariffs had ended and the Anahuac customs office had reopened. When Viezca escaped and reached Texas, no one recognized him as governor. As protests spread across Texas, Mexican officials increasingly blamed the settlers from the United States for the discontent.

==Texas Revolution==


In an effort to secure his freedom, in January 1835 Austin had published his &quot;Exposition to the Public Regarding the Affairs of Texas&quot;. In this document, he explained that Texas wanted to be a separate state, not an independent nation. He discussed the grievances against the Texas justice system and justified the conventions of 1832 and 1833 as &quot;&#x27;an exercise of the right to petition that belongs to every free people&#x27;&quot;. He was finally released from prison and had returned to Texas, by August. He changed his mind in prison about the future of Texas and issued a call to arms, announcing that Texas should be &quot;&#x27;forever free of any Mexican control&#x27;&quot;. 

After the Mexican Congress elected Antonio López de Santa Anna as President of Mexico in 1833, he appointed Valentín Gómez Farías as his vice president and turned over much of the governing of Mexico to him. However, the Vice President began implementing reforms, particularly impacting the Mexican Army and the Catholic Church. These reforms angered the powerful centrist forces, who urged Santa Anna to abandon his semi-retirement. Santa Anna agreed and led the reaction against liberalization, forcing Gómez Farías and his Federalist supporters, including Mexican General José Antonio Mexía, to flee into exile in the United States. Some went to New Orleans, where they planned to resist the Centralist government.

Although the United States government remained officially neutral in the Mexican struggle between Santa Anna&#x27;s Centralists and Gomez Farias&#x27; Federalists, there was much political sympathy favoring the separation of Texas from Mexico. A number of men, known as &quot;filibusters&quot;, were attracted to militia-type organizations such as the New Orleans Greys, preparing to go fight for Texas independence. General Mexia soon found financing in New Orleans and began raising an expedition to attack the important Mexican port of Tampico. He persuaded influential people in New Orleans that seizing the port would aid the Texian cause. However, the &quot;Tampico Expedition&quot; that he began on November 6, 1835, failed.

In 1835 Juan Seguin, Plácido Benavides, Manuel Leal, and Salvador Flores began raising companies of volunteers from the San Antonio and Victoria areas to support the federalist cause. By the end of the year over 100 Tejanos had joined the Federal Army of Texas to defend the Constitution of 1824 against the centralists. The political chief of the Nacogdoches region told the militias to take arms against the Mexican troops in July 1835 and asked the rest of the citizens to form a volunteer army. &quot;Texas committees&quot; in cities such as New Orleans and New York City mustered volunteers and began sending an army and money to assist the Texas colonists in their fight. Austin commanded the militias, while Sam Houston was placed in charge of the volunteers. The first violent incident occurred on October 2 at the Battle of Gonzales.

The Consultation met in November to discuss the reasons for the revolt. The Consultation denounced centralism and organized a provisional state government based &quot;&#x27;on the principles of the 1824 Constitution&#x27;&quot;. The following month, San Antonio surrendered to the Anglos, giving the rebels a great deal of military equipment. Some Texans traveled to the United States seeking aid. Although they were denied a loan, they managed to heavily advertise the availability of land in Texas, ensuring that more volunteers would come to fight.
Texas formally declared independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836. The revolt was justified as necessary to protect basic rights and because Mexico had annulled the federal pact. The colonists maintained that Mexico had invited them to move to the country and they were determined &quot;to enjoy &#x27;the republican institutions to which they were accustomed in their native land, the United States of America.&#x27;&quot; The declaration did not acknowledge that Mexico had attempted to incorporate some of their demands. The new Texas constitution specifically allowed slavery and said no free person of African descent could reside in the new country without Congress&#x27;s consent. Many of the Tejanos left the fight after the declaration of independence as they were disappointed with the growing anti-Mexican rhetoric. Only Seguin&#x27;s company remained in the Texian Army.

The war ended with the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, with the birth of the Republic of Texas. Santa Anna was taken prisoner, and the Mexican troops were forced to withdraw south of the Rio Grande. It is remarkable that Sam Houston was able to keep the Texans from killing Santa Anna since he had slaughtered the men of the Alamo and Goliad. In the ensuing Treaties of Velasco, Santa Anna promised he would convince the Mexican government to recognize Texan independence. Santa Anna was released to the United States, which then turned him over to Mexico. The newly appointed president of Mexico (Anastasio Bustamante) and the Mexican Congress both rejected the Treaties of Velasco, declaring that because he had signed them under duress, they were null and void. Santa Anna later said, &quot;I did promise to try to get a hearing for the Texas Commissioners, but this in itself did not bind the government to receive them.&quot;

<text>The Koyukon, Dinaa, or Denaa (Denaakk&#x27;e: &quot;Tl’eeyegge Hut’aane&quot;) are an Alaska Native Athabascan people of the Athabascan-speaking ethnolinguistic group. Their traditional territory is along the Koyukuk and Yukon rivers where they subsisted for thousands of years by hunting and trapping. Many Koyukon live in a similar manner today.

The Koyukon language belongs to a large family called Na-Dené or Athabascan, traditionally spoken by numerous groups of native people throughout northwestern North America. In addition, due to ancient migrations of related peoples, other Na-Dené languages, such as Navajo and Apachean varieties, are spoken in the American Southwest and in Mexico.

==History==
The first Europeans to enter Koyukon territory were Russians, who came up the Yukon River to Nulato in 1838. When they arrived, they found that items such as iron pots, glass beads, cloth apparel, and tobacco had already reached the people through their trade with coastal Eskimos, who had long traded with Russians. An epidemic of smallpox had preceded them, causing high fatalities in the village. In subsequent years, European infectious diseases drastically reduced the Koyukon population, who had no immunity to these new diseases.

Relative isolation persisted along the Koyukuk until 1898, when the Yukon Gold Rush brought more than a thousand men to the river. They found little gold, and most left the following winter.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the Koyukon people have inhabited their region for at least 1,000 years, with cultural roots there that stretch back thousands of years earlier.

==Ethnobotany==

The Koyukon freeze lingonberries for winter use.

<text>The Seven Mile Bridge is a bridge in the Florida Keys, in Monroe County, Florida, United States. It connects Knight&#x27;s Key (part of the city of Marathon, Florida) in the Middle Keys to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys. Among the longest bridges in existence when it was built, it is part of the Overseas Highway in the Keys, which is part of the U.S. Route 1.

There are two bridges in this location. The modern bridge is open to vehicular traffic; the older one only to pedestrians and cyclists. The older bridge, originally known as the Knights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet Channel Bridge, was constructed from 1909 to 1912 under the direction of Henry Flagler and Clarence S. Coe as part of the Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s Key West Extension, also known as the Overseas Railroad.

==History==

After the railroad was damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the line was sold to the United States government, which refurbished Seven Mile Bridge for automobile use. Unsupported sections were added in 1935 to widen it for vehicular traffic. Dismantled trackage was recycled, painted white, and used as guardrails. It had a swing span to allow passage of boats in the Moser Channel of the Intracoastal Waterway into Hawk Channel, near where the bridge crosses Pigeon Key, a small island that held a work camp for Flagler&#x27;s railroad. Hurricane Donna in 1960 caused further damage. The current road bridge was constructed from 1978 to 1982.

The vast majority of the original bridge still exists, although the swing span has been removed. The section to Pigeon Key, used as a fishing pier and long open to motorized vehicles to give access to the key, was closed to motorized traffic in 2008 after the unsupported sections began to sag. In 2014, the Florida Department of Transportation approved a $77 million plan to restore the old bridge. By 2017, the pedestrian section was closed for extensive repairs, and reopened in January 2022.

==Engineering==
The new bridge is a box-girder structure built from precast, prestressed concrete sections, comprising 440 spans. Near the center, the bridge rises in an arc to provide -high clearance for boat passage. The remainder of the bridge is considerably closer to the water surface. The new bridge does not cross Pigeon Key.

The total length of the new bridge is actually or , and is shorter than the original. The bridge carries the Florida Keys aqueduct, supplying water to points west, as well as fiber optic cables, providing telecommunications to and from the lower Keys.

Each April, the bridge is closed for about 2.5 hours on a Saturday for the Seven Mile Bridge Run that commemorates the Florida Keys bridge rebuilding project. The event began in 1982 to commemorate the completion of a federally funded bridge building program that replaced spans that oil tycoon Henry Flagler constructed in the early 1900s to serve as a foundation for his Overseas Railroad.

The Seven Mile Bridge was engineered by Figg &amp; Muller Engineers (who also engineered the much taller Sunshine Skyway Bridge). The structure was completed six months ahead of schedule and has earned eight awards, including an Exceptional Award for Cost Savings Innovation from the Federal Highway Administration.

==In fiction==
The bridge has been featured in films and television series, such as &quot;Road House&quot;, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, and is seen in the upcoming video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto VI.&quot;

<doc id="980425" wikidata="Q6724194" url="?curid=980425" title="Mack Bolan">
<text>Mack Bolan, alias &quot;The Executioner&quot;, is a fictional character who has been serialized in 631 novels with sales of more than 200 million books. Created by Don Pendleton, Bolan made his first appearance on the printed page in &quot;The Executioner #1: War Against the Mafia&quot; (1969). Pendleton wrote 37 other novels featuring Bolan, often referred to as the &quot;Mafia Wars&quot;. In 1980, Pendleton sold his rights to the character to Gold Eagle, which hired a number of ghostwriters to continue publishing Bolan monthly, to satisfy reader demand worldwide. Pendleton remained credited as the sole author and supervised these new adventures, which took the Bolan character all over the world fighting terrorism. This new series of books featured Bolan as a principled warrior fighting larger-than-life adversaries in the spirit of a tougher, American version of James Bond. The demand for the books continued, and Gold Eagle began releasing as many as 15 titles annually. In 2014, more than a dozen Mack Bolan novels were being published every year worldwide by Gold Eagle Books, a division of Harlequin Books. Additionally, Bolan was &quot;spun off&quot; into several new adventure book series which also carried the Mack Bolan/Don Pendleton names.

==Fictional character biography==
When asked his name and rank in &quot;Colorado Kill Zone,&quot; he replied, &quot;Bolan, Mack Samuel, Master Sergeant&quot;. Bolan, born in 1939 and raised in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, is of Welsh-Polish heritage and is the eldest of the three children of steelworker Samuel Bolan and his wife, Elsa. Bolan enlisted in the Army at age 18 and served two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Green Beret, even though newer novels do not make any reference to this as it makes him seem too old.

Bolan became an expert sniper with over 90 kills to his record, earning him the nickname &quot;The Executioner&quot;. For all his lethal capability, Bolan was deeply compassionate and became known as &quot;Sgt. Mercy&quot;, because of the aid he often gave to Vietnamese civilians and others who needed help.

During his service in the Vietnam War, Bolan became highly adept at penetration and intelligence gathering, guerrilla warfare and became a skilled armorer.

During Bolan&#x27;s second tour, his father suffered a heart attack that forced him to leave his job at the steel mill. Unable to work, with bills piling up, Bolan&#x27;s father was forced to borrow money from Triangle Industrial Finance (&quot;TIF&quot;), a savings-and-loan outfit known around town as a loansharking operation controlled by the family of Don Sergio Frenchi, the godfather of the Mafia in western Massachusetts. The people at TIF caused the elder Bolan countless problems with their payment demands. On one occasion, their enforcers dislocated his arm as punishment for missing one loan payment, warning him that the same arm would be broken if he missed another.

Mack Bolan&#x27;s younger sister, Cindy Bolan, was worried about their father&#x27;s safety and had secretly paid the officers at TIF a visit, in an attempt to persuade them to leave her father alone and allow her to repay the loan. In her first attempt, she turned in $35 a week, money she made from an after school job. When it became insufficient, TIF &quot;suggested&quot; she become a prostitute.

Johnny Bolan, Mack&#x27;s younger brother, learned about it from a schoolmate who taunted him about it, resulting in a fight that Johnny lost. When Johnny found Cindy servicing a client in a motel room, he blew the whistle to his father ... an act that resulted in the elder Bolan&#x27;s striking him. When Cindy&#x27;s father confronted her, she admitted to her work, expressing her fear for his health and welfare.

For Sam Bolan, it was too much. He snapped and turned a Smith &amp; Wesson .45 on his family and then himself. Johnny Bolan was the only survivor of the murder-suicide.

A few days later, Bolan was notified of the tragedy by an Army chaplain and took emergency leave to visit his brother. After Johnny told him the whole story, Bolan broke into a sportsman&#x27;s shop and took a high-powered Marlin .444, a deluxe scope, some targets, and several boxes of ammunition, leaving an envelope of money to cover the &quot;purchase&quot;. He would use the rifle to kill the TIF loansharks, marking the beginning of his war against the Mafia.

==Stony Man==
After 38 bloody campaigns against the Mafia, Bolan became the leader of the Stony Man organization in the &quot;Super Bolan&quot; book titled &quot;Stony Man Doctrine&quot;, working with Able Team, Phoenix Force, Hal Brognola, April Rose, Aaron (The Bear) Kurtzman, and Jack Grimaldi.

==War against the Mafia and the KGB==
After the KGB attempted to destroy Stony Man and the death of April Rose, Bolan left the organization to resume his solo war against evil...this time adding the KGB to his hit list. It was during this war that he was framed by the mob for the murder of a prostitute in McLary County, Texas, resulting in Bolan&#x27;s being tried for his extra-legal activities.

==Current activities==
Bolan currently works on his own at arm&#x27;s length from the clandestine agency Stony Man. He occasionally takes missions from Stony Man&#x27;s director and personal friend, Hal Brognola, and the President of the United States. Frequently, Bolan returns to Stony Man to lead the agency on missions.

==Personal life==
Bolan has been in love only twice. His first lover was Valentina &quot;Val&quot; Querente, whom he met when he first went up against the mob. He broke off their relationship after she and Johnny Bolan had been kidnapped.

His second love was federal agent April Rose, whom he met during the first of his final campaigns against the Mafia. He holds current lover, Barbara Price, at arm&#x27;s length out of fear she, like Val and April, will be threatened, harmed, or killed.

In each book, Bolan usually has sex with a different woman. He prefers the gutsy type who are not apt to run away when shot at, which explains his deep affection for Querente, federal agent Toby Ranger, and April Rose. In one novel, a woman with whom he was working claimed that he liked his women &quot;barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen&quot;. Bolan replied, &quot;No, I like them alive&quot;.

In his spare time, he likes extreme sports, such as canoeing several rivers in flood stage. He typically likes to spend his spare time with Barbara Price.

He is very literate. This is shown at the beginning of each novel, where Bolan gives his interpretation/response to a quote from a book, author, or famous person. He frequently reads Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; masterwork &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

==Languages==
In addition to his native language, English, Bolan speaks Arabic, Spanish, Russian, and passable German, and can understand many other languages.

==Weapons==
Throughout his war against the Mafia, Bolan used a variety of weapons. His primary long gun was the .460 Weatherby Mark V, which he obtained from Nicholas &quot;Nick Trigger&quot; Woods, a top Mafia hitman sent to kill him. For a sidearm, he used a silenced Beretta Brigadier, which he nicknamed &quot;Belle&quot; and carried in a vertical shoulder rig. His trademark weapon was &quot;Big Thunder&quot;, a stainless steel .44 AutoMag that he usually wore on his hip.

The Brigadier and AutoMag have since been supplanted by the current favorites, the Beretta 93R and .44 Magnum Desert Eagle, though Bolan has demonstrated facility with any pistol or rifle he comes across, and often carries a knife.

==Mack Bolan books==

Mack Bolan books are currently divided into three series: Executioner (&quot;Mack Bolan&quot;), Super Bolan, and Stony Man.

*Both the Executioner and Super Bolan series detail Bolan&#x27;s exploits. Executioner is the original series that was started by Don Pendelton in 1969; 453 books were published in this series between 1969 and 2017 (these novels being typically 180 pages long).

In France, a new spin-off series, Kira B., featuring Mack Bolan&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot; Kira, was introduced by the publisher Vauvenargues, in 2012. Written under the pen name Steven Belly, the series follows the adventures of Kira, a young woman who appeared in &quot;L&#x27;Exécuteur nº300: Le réseau Phénix&quot;, where she manipulated Mack Bolan to come out of retirement to fight against cyber-criminals. Since then, she has helped her &quot;father&quot; in his fight against crime and now is the heroine of her own, eponymous series, which includes the following titles:
#&quot;Kira 1: Ondes de Choc dans l&#x27;Oregon&quot; (2012, &quot;Shockwaves in Oregon&quot;) 
#&quot;Kira 2: L&#x27;Aigle de Brandebourg&quot; (2013, &quot;Brandeburger Eagle&quot;)
#&quot;Kira 3: Neige de sang sur Oslo&quot; (2013)
#&quot;Kira 4: Crisis&quot; (2013)
#&quot;Kira 5: La Quadrature sibérienne&quot; (2013)

A publishing deal was made for e-book versions of Don Pendleton&#x27;s original 37-volume series with Open Road Media. Pendleton&#x27;s only Mack Bolan Short Story, &quot;Willing To Kill&quot;, written in 1978, is now in print.

==In other media==
In 1985, Gesture Press published Canadian poet Mark Laba&#x27;s &quot;The Mack Bolan Poems&quot;, inspired by Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;Jersey Guns&quot;.

In 1993, Innovation Publishing released a three-issue comic book miniseries, &quot;Mack Bolan: The Executioner&quot;.

In 2008, a five-issue comic book miniseries was released by IDW Publishing titled &quot;Don Pendleton&#x27;s The Executioner: The Devil&#x27;s Tools&quot;, starring Mack Bolan. Issues were released on a monthly basis. It was written by Doug Wojtowicz and illustrated by SI. Gallant.

It was announced August 2014 that Shane Salerno, Hollywood producer and screenwriter has optioned the Executioner Mack Bolan Series of action/adventure novels for a film franchise, and Bradley Cooper will be portraying Bolan in a film version of the book series with Todd Phillips attached as director, but it looks like the project was abandoned.

The 1986 action movie &quot;Jake Speed&quot; is a direct takeoff-parody of Mack Bolan, who (as a character) is mentioned several times, and several Bolan books are shown alongside the Jake Speed books, in which Wayne Crawford plays the titular character, a real life version of a fictional character. In one scene, the back of a Bolan book has words changed to be a Jake Speed book.
