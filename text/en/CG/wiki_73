<text>Jeffrey Corwin (born July 11, 1967) is an American biologist and wildlife conservationist, known for hosting Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Going Wild with Jeff Corwin&quot;, &quot;The Jeff Corwin Experience&quot; on Animal Planet, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin&quot;/&quot;Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin&quot; and &quot;Wildlife Nation with Jeff Corwin&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Corwin was born on July 11, 1967, in Norwell, Massachusetts, where he attended Norwell High School, then went on to spend his freshman year of college at the Eastern Nazarene College, in Quincy, Massachusetts. Later he attended Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater. He conducted his graduate studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, obtaining a Master of Science in wildlife and fisheries conservation and doing work on bats and snakes. In 1999, Bridgewater awarded Corwin an honorary doctorate in public education.
Corwin was also certified as an Advanced Field Medical Specialist by the U.S. Army Academy of Health Sciences, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

====Conservation====
Corwin first experienced the tropical rain forests in 1984 in Belize. As an undergraduate, he became active in the conservation of rain forests in Central and South America. He also participated in the youth action committee for the United Nations Environmental Program.

In 1993, Corwin addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations regarding the need to conserve neotropical rain forests. Corwin lectures on wildlife, gold mining, ecology, and conservation to audiences throughout the United States.

====Television====
In 1994, Corwin served as expedition naturalist for the documentary series titled The JASON Project, led by oceanographer Bob Ballard and sponsored in part by National Geographic. From 1997 to 1999 Corwin hosted a show for the Disney Channel titled &quot;Going Wild with Jeff Corwin&quot;. From 2001 to 2005 Corwin partnered with Animal Planet and Discovery Communications, serving as host and executive producer of two series, &quot;The Jeff Corwin Experience&quot; from 2000 until 2003 and &quot;Corwin&#x27;s Quest&quot; that ran for a single season in 2005 and 2006.

In 2003, Corwin appeared in an episode of the crime drama &quot;&quot;. In the episode, he played himself, portrayed as a former classmate of Eric Delko, played by Adam Rodriguez. Titled &quot;Death Grip&quot;, Corwin helped detectives retrieve a human foot from inside a live crocodile. In 2003 Corwin hosted a television documentary for Animal Planet titled &quot;Giant Monsters&quot;.

In the spring of 2007, Corwin began a new TV show on the Travel Channel titled &quot;Into Alaska with Jeff Corwin&quot;. Also, in 2007, Corwin was sponsored by CNN to be an environment correspondent for an &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot; special called &quot;Planet in Peril&quot;, along with co-host Sanjay Gupta.

In 2009, Corwin partnered with Defenders of Wildlife to host the documentary series &quot;Feeling the Heat&quot;. In 2009 Corwin also hosted a television special for MSNBC with the same title of his book &quot;Future Earth: 100 Heartbeats&quot;. Corwin has been on expeditions to six of the seven continents—all except Antarctica.

In 2011, during the tsunami in Japan, Corwin was used as a geologist on MSNBC to help explain the tsunami. The same year, he voiced an alligator expert in an episode of The Hub&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;.
In 2012, Corwin starred in a Claritin commercial as himself.

From 2011 to 2016, Corwin hosted and was an executive producer on the ABC Weekend Adventure wildlife adventure series &quot;Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin&quot;. The series won Outstanding Travel Program in the 41st Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2014, and Corwin won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Travel/Children&#x27;s Series Host in 2016.

In October 2016, ABC began showing the global cruising series, &quot;Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin,&quot; which involves ecology. Five years later, he launched his current series &quot;Wildlife Nation with Jeff Corwin&quot;. It is presented by Defenders of Wildlife.

====Close encounter with elephant====
In filming a segment of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Planet in Peril&quot; with Anderson Cooper at Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on March 22, 2007, Corwin was the victim of a playful elephant. This rough-play consisted of the elephant putting Corwin&#x27;s elbow in its mouth and wrapping its trunk around his arm, and swinging him around. He yelled as the elephant shook its head, releasing and throwing Corwin into the shallow water in which they were standing. Corwin noted that the pain was so overwhelming that he nearly blacked out, and that his arm still does not work correctly. Corwin later posted the following summary of injuries that resulted:

==Personal life==
Corwin lives in Marshfield, Massachusetts, with his wife Natasha and their two daughters: Maya Rose (b. July 6, 2003) and Marina (b. September 11, 2008).

He is of Hungarian and Romanian ancestry on his father&#x27;s side.

<text>Teresa Mary Hooley (1888–1973) was an English poet, known in later life as Mrs. F. H. Butler. She is known mostly for her war poem &quot;A War Film&quot;, about World War I.

==Biography==
She was born in Risley, Derbyshire, and (accordingly to a letter from her sold at auction recently) she lived at Goldenbrook Farm in Risley at some point during her life. Teresa Mary Hooley&#x27;s early life was spent at Risley Lodge, the home of her father Terah Hooley (died 1927), a successful lace manufacturer who built Springfield Mill at Sandiacre, and her mother Mary (died 1928), his second wife. She made her name before the Great War, writing poems in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; alongside Edith Sitwell – not an admirer of her work. During the war, she presumably had an interest in Spiritualism, since her poem &quot;Christ of the Night&quot; appeared in the &quot;Occult Review&quot; in December 1915, on p. 342. Her work was published in a number of collections in the 1920s and 1930s but has largely fallen out of fashion. One of her poems, &quot;The Owl&quot; (Sova) was published in a 1939 Czech language compilation of animal poetry. She had two full brothers who survived childhood. Of these the younger, Basil Terah Hooley, born in 1893, was decorated in the Great War but died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Her much older half-brother was the financier Ernest Terah Hooley of Risley Hall with whom she maintained a civil if frosty relationship. Hooley married Frank H. Butler in May 1920 at All Saints&#x27; Church, Risley. They had a son but the marriage did not survive. In later life some found her a formidable presence.

Hooley was a vice-president of the League Against Cruel Sports.

==&quot;A War Film&quot;==
Hooley&#x27;s poem &quot;A War Film&quot; describes the experience of seeing documentary footage of World War I, and refers to the Retreat from Mons, after one of the great battles of the Great War.

Although this is Hooley&#x27;s most well known poem little is known about it, and its date has been debated in online fora. It has been assumed the poem was inspired by watching documentary footage about World War I. The earliest documentary was &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot; (1916), but it is unlikely that a contemporary writer would confuse the Battle of the Somme and the Retreat from Mons. It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the 1926 film, &quot;Mons&quot;, was the most probable source. The fact that the poem can be found in &quot;Songs of all Seasons&quot; (published 1927) could be seen to bear this hypothesis out.

==Basil Terah Hooley==

Basil Terah Hooley (1892–1918), was born in Risley, Derby, on 8 June 1892. He was commissioned in April 1915, later promoted to Lieutenant and to Major. On 23 June 1915 he married Emily Dorothy Thirlby of Risley, at All Saints church, Risley. A member of the University College Nottingham OTC, Major Hooley served with the 7th Bn Sherwood Foresters (Notts &amp; Derby Regiment), and was a tank commander in the Battles of Amiens on 18 August 1918.

Basil Hooley died at the age of twenty-six of pneumonia following influenza, while home on leave on 28 October 1918 . He was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry in November 1918. A memorial window to Major Basil Terah Hooley M.C., was placed in the north aisle of All Saints Church in Risley.

<text>Henry Cockton (7 December 1807 – 26 June 1853) was an English novelist, remembered primarily for &quot;The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox, the Ventriloquist&quot; (1839–40).

Henry Cockton was born in George Yard, Shoreditch, London, the third of eight children of William and Mary Cockton. His father may have been a weaver. Nothing is known about his childhood or education; all that can be ascertained about his early life is that he spent some years employed in a house of business (possibly as a draper&#x27;s assistant) in Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk. Here, on 9 May 1837, he married Ann Howes in St. James&#x27;s Church (now the Cathedral). Ann was the daughter of Eleanor Howes, a widow who owned &quot;The Seven Stars&quot; Inn in Long Brackland, a street in that town. Henry and Ann had a daughter, Eleanor Anne, and a son, Edward Stanley, born in Bury St. Edmunds on 20 December 1839 and 11 December 1841.

In 1839 Henry Cockton commenced writing &quot;The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox the Ventriloquist&quot;. Published by Robert Tyas of London, in the monthly serial format, popularised by Charles Dickens, it was an immediate success, enjoying great popularity and acclaim. Illustrations by Thomas Onwhyn were a prominent feature of this, and most of Henry Cockton&#x27;s later novels. The first three chapters are set &#x27;in one of the most ancient and populous boroughs in the county of Suffolk&#x27;, a thinly disguised Bury St. Edmunds. Valentine Vox teaches himself ventriloquism after seeing a performer in a local tavern, then uses his skills to create mayhem and mischief. Fearing this will lead him into trouble, his family send him to stay with his uncle Grimwood Goodman in London. This provides unlimited opportunities to perform pranks, such as disrupting political meetings, theatrical performances, educational lectures and social events. Valentine develops a close friendship with Grimwood. Fearing that Grimwood will re-write his will in Valentine&#x27;s favour, unscrupulous relatives have Grimwood confined in a private lunatic asylum, where he undergoes many horrific experiences. Eventually Valentine finds Grimwood, and liberates him, not by using ventriloquism, but by paying for his release. At the novel&#x27;s conclusion, Valentine marries the love interest, Louise Raven, and abandons ventriloquism. Valentine&#x27;s activities as a ventriloquist are quite incredible, showing an impossible, almost super-human level of ability: by the end of the book he has duped literally hundreds of people from all walks of life in all situations, not one of whom ever suspects him. Yet the novel contains no technical information about ventriloquism, and it is doubtful if the author had any practical knowledge of the subject. The completed work contained a preface by Henry Cockton, outlining the scandal of private lunatic asylums. As with Charles Dickens in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, he clearly intended to draw attention to a social issue about which he felt strongly.

&quot;Valentine Vox&quot; was lauded as one of the most amusing and entertaining works of the year, rivalling the popularity of Dickens&#x27;s novels. Between 1853 and 1902 over 400,000 copies were published in the UK. It even spawned an imitation: Thomas Peckett Prest wrote a plagiarism, &quot;The Adventures of Valentine Vaux, or, the Tricks of&quot; &quot;a Ventriloquist&quot; (1840), using the pseudonym Timothy Portwine. &quot;Valentine Vox&quot; was last printed in 1920. While modern readers will probably gain little from the humour, which consists of one joke, told with repetition, it contains some vividly observed scenes of contemporary London life, which can be read as sources of social history.

The success of &quot;Valentine Vox&quot; prompted Richard Bentley to commission Henry Cockton to write &quot;Stanley Thorn&quot; (1841) for &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. This was not an original composition, but a work initiated by Richard Barham in which several authors had been asked to collaborate in a work on the theme of The Rake&#x27;s Progress, about the downfall of a wealthy young man of property. Henry Cockton was given the manuscripts to adapt and complete, which he did, adding an unconvincing happy ending in place of the tragic end that was originally envisioned.

Henry Cockton does not seem to have made much money from novel-writing, as the 1841 census showed him and his family as resident in 165 Blackfriars Road, Southwark, where they were lodgers of Maria Dowie, a widowed dressmaker.

Henry Cockton&#x27;s third novel, &quot;George St. George Julian, the Prince&quot; was intended to expose financial corruption, fraud and forgery. In the course of his misadventures the eponymous hero encounters several rogues and cheats, including the historical Gregor MacGregor, the self-styled &quot;Cazique of Poyais&quot;. The publisher collapsed before Henry Cockton had received any payment for &quot;George St. George Julian&quot;, and he was effectively bankrupted, being imprisoned for debt, but being released after declaring himself an insolvent debtor.

Three further novels followed. &quot;The Sisters: Or England and France&quot; (1843), originally serialised in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, set in Regency England, tells the stories of Caroline and Lucrece, whose lives diverge as a result of their marriages. &quot;Sylvester Sound the Somnambulist&quot; (1844), was a comic tale about a persistent sleepwalker, who unknowingly performs many exploits in this state. A comic novel, it enjoyed some success, selling over 40,000 copies, and remaining in print until 1921. &quot;The Love Match&quot; (1845), about a general&#x27;s daughter who marries a stable hand, is of some interest for descriptions of the contemporary Newmarket horse-racing community: this featured a terse message announcing it would probably be the author&#x27;s last book.

His failure to make a financial profit from writing was probably the primary reason for his change of career, and he returned to Bury St. Edmunds to run &quot;The Seven Stars&quot; for his mother-in-law. Here he unwisely stood surety for the sum of £200 for his brother, Edward, only to lose the money when Edward fled to Australia. He then embarked on a malting speculation, buying large quantities of the product, possibly for re-sale or to start a business, but he was largely ignorant of the malt trade, and his scheme collapsed, leaving him financially ruined.

He abandoned innkeeping, and, with his family, moved into his mother-in-law&#x27;s house, where he wrote three further novels, none of which enjoyed great success. &quot;The Steward: a Romance of Real Life&quot; (1850), describes the downfall of George Croly, a Suffolk country gentleman, who is categorically lambasted as an evil, duplicitous person. An angry vitriolic work, &quot;The Steward&quot; possibly reflects the author&#x27;s own feelings at the time. &quot;Lady Felicia&quot; (1852), a Cinderella inspired story about a shop assistant who marries a titled lady, is of some interest for its setting in Sudbury in Suffolk, against a background of local political corruption, a theme which had featured in the Pickwick Papers. &quot;Percy Effingham, or the germ of the world&#x27;s esteem&quot; (1853), the story of an amiable and intelligent, but naive young man, who loses &#x27;the world&#x27;s esteem&#x27; (in this case, money and financial success), may have reflected the author&#x27;s feelings about his own life, being finished only a few days before his death, on 26 June 1853. Four days later he was buried in an unmarked grave in the town churchyard of Bury St. Edmunds. There were no obituary notices.

Soon after his death his widow petitioned the Royal Literary Fund for financial assistance, in a detailed account of his life and misfortunes. Never published, this makes sad reading. She received £25.

In 1856 &quot;The Bury And Norwich Post&quot; published a further appeal for his family. In 1884 some admirers raised a tablet in his memory on the wall of the abbey&#x27;s ruined charnel house in the town churchyard.

The name Valentine Vox has been adopted as a stage name by Jack Riley, a popular performer of and author about ventriloquism, and used as a title of a record album released by Chris Jagger in 1974.

<text>Edward James Mortimer Collins (29 June 1827 – 28 July 1876) was an English novelist, journalist and poet. Some of his lyrics, with their &quot;light grace, their sparkling wit and their airy philosophy&quot;, were described in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;equal to anything of their kind in modern English&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born at Plymouth, where his father, Francis Collins, was a solicitor. He was educated at a private school, and after some years spent as mathematics master at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, he relocated to London. Collins devoted himself to journalism written from the Conservative Party perspective, mainly for periodicals. He also wrote occasional and humorous verse, and several novels. Soon after his second marriage, to Frances Collins in 1868, he settled at Knowl Hill, Berkshire and from this time he rarely left his home for a day and published several novels.

He died at the Nightingale Hotel, Richmond, while visiting his son-in-law. His funeral was attended by many literary friends, including Tom Taylor, the editor of Punch, the novelist R. D. Blackmore, and the poets Frederick Locker and R H Horne. He was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Petersham; there is no memorial stone.

==Writings==
In 1855, he published his &quot;Idyls and Rhymes&quot;; and in 1865 his first story, &quot;Who is the Heir?&quot; was published. A second volume of lyrics, &quot;The Inn of Strange Meetings&quot;, was issued in 1871; and in 1872 he produced his longest and best sustained poem, &quot;The British Birds, a communication from the Ghost of Aristophanes&quot;.

He also wrote several novels, including &quot;Sweet Anne Page&quot; (1868), &quot;Two Plunges for a Pearl&quot; (1872), &quot;Miranda&quot; (1873), &quot;Mr. Carrington&quot; (1873, under the name of R. T. Cotton), &quot;Squire Silchester&#x27;s Whim&quot; (1873, set in Devon), &quot;Sweet and Twenty&quot; (1875), and &quot;A Fight with Fortune&quot; (1876). His three-volume novel &quot;Transmigration&quot; (1873) is &quot;a fantasy of multiple incarnations of which the middle one is set on a utopian Mars.&quot;

Collins is credited by the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot; with introducing &quot;psithurism&quot; to the English language. Derived from the Ancient Greek for &quot;whisper&quot;, it was applied specifically to the whispering of the wind. This was observed (inaccurately) by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in an editorial of 30 September 1909 - reprinted on 30 September 2006 but not available online.

<text>George Combe (21 October 1788 – 14 August 1858) was a Scottish lawyer and a spokesman of the phrenological movement for over 20 years. He founded the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1820 and wrote &quot;The Constitution of Man&quot; (1828). After marriage in 1833, Combe devoted his later years to promoting phrenology internationally.

==Early life==
George Combe was born at Livingston&#x27;s Yards, Edinburgh, the son of Marion (née Newton, died 1819) and George Combe, a prosperous brewer in the city. His younger brother was the physician Andrew Combe. After attending the High School of Edinburgh, he studied law at the University of Edinburgh, entered a lawyer&#x27;s office in 1804, and in 1812 began a solicitor&#x27;s practice at 11 Bank Street.

In 1820 Combe moved his office to Mylnes Court on the Royal Mile and moved house to 8 Hermitage Place in Stockbridge. In 1825 he moved with Andrew to 2 Brown Square off the Grassmarket. The Combe brothers lived together in a large dwelling at 25 Northumberland Street in the New Town from 1829.

==Phrenological Society==

In 1815, the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; contained an article on the system of &quot;craniology&quot; devised by Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim, denouncing it as &quot;a piece of thorough quackery from beginning to end&quot;. When Spurzheim came to Edinburgh in 1816, Combe was invited to a friend&#x27;s house, where he watched Spurzheim dissect a human brain. Impressed by the demonstration, he attended a second series of Spurzheim&#x27;s lectures. On investigating the subject for himself, he became satisfied that the fundamental principles of phrenology were true: &quot;that the brain is the organ of mind; that the brain is an aggregate of several parts, each subserving a distinct mental faculty; and that the size of the cerebral organ is, &quot;caeteris paribus&quot;, an index of power or energy of function.&quot;

His first essay on phrenology was published in &quot;Scots Magazine&quot; in 1817, and were followed by a series of papers &quot;Literary and Statistical Magazine&quot;. The writings were collected and published in 1819 in book form as &quot;Essays on Phrenology&quot; and, in later editions, as &quot;A System of Phrenology&quot;. In 1820, Combe helped to found the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh, which in 1823 established a &quot;Phrenological Journal&quot;. His lectures and writings also drew attention to phrenology in Europe and the United States.

==Debate with Hamilton==
Combe began to lecture at Edinburgh in 1822. He published a Manual, &quot;Elements of Phrenology&quot;, in June 1824. He took private tuition in elocution; contemporaries described him as clever and opinionated. Combe&#x27;s discussions had an air of confidentiality and theatrical urgency. Converts came in, societies sprang up and controversies began.

A second edition of &quot;Elements&quot;, 1825, was attacked by Francis Jeffrey in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; of September 1825. Combe replied in a pamphlet and the journal. The phrenologists were attacked again in 1826 and 1827 by Sir William Hamilton in addresses to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The sharp controversy included challenges to public disputes and mutual charges of misrepresentation, in which Spurzheim took part. The correspondence appeared in the fourth and fifth volumes of the &quot;Phrenological Journal&quot;.

==Social interests: schools, prisons and asylums==

In 1836, Combe stood for the chair of Logic at the University of Edinburgh against two other candidates: Sir William Hamilton and Isaac Taylor. Hamilton won by 18 votes against 14 for Taylor. In 1838 Combe visited the United States to study the treatment of criminals there. He initiated a programme of public education in chemistry, physiology, history and moral philosophy.

Combe sought to improve public education through a national, non-sectarian system. He helped to set up a school in Edinburgh run on the principles of William Ellis, and did some teaching there in phrenology and physiology. It was prompted by the London Birkbeck School, which had opened on 17 July 1848. Combe was strongly behind the view that the state should be involved in the education system. In this he was backed by William Jolly, an inspector of schools, and noted by Frank Pierrepont Graves.

Combe was much concerned about prison reform. He and William A. F. Browne opened a debate on introducing humane treatment of psychiatric patients in publicly funded asylums.

==Later life==
John Ramsay L&#x27;Amy, son of James L&#x27;Amy, trained under Combe at his offices at 25 Northumberland Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

In 1842, Combe gave a course of 22 lectures on phrenology at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg and travelled about Europe enquiring into management of schools, prisons and asylums.

On retiring, Combe took a substantial terraced townhouse, 45 Melville Street, in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End. He was revising the 9th edition of the &quot;Constitution of Man&quot; when he died at Moor Park, Farnham in August 1858. He lies under a simple headstone in the Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh, against the north wall of the original section. His wife Cecilia Siddons is buried with him.

==Works==
In 1817, Combe&#x27;s first essay on phrenology in &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; was followed by a series of papers on the subject in the &quot;Literary and Statistical Magazine&quot;. These appeared in book form in 1819 as &quot;Essays on Phrenology&quot;, entitled &quot;A System of Phrenology&quot; in later editions.
Combe&#x27;s most popular work, &quot;The Constitution of Man&quot;, appeared in 1828 but was widely denounced as materialist and atheist. He argued in it: &quot;Mental qualities are determined by the size, form and constitution of the brain; and these are transmitted by hereditary descent.&quot;

Combe was one of an active Edinburgh scene of people thinking about the nature of heredity and its possible malleability, as Lamarck proposed. Combe himself was no Lamarckian, but in the decades before Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; was published, the &quot;Constitution&quot; was probably the single most important vehicle for disseminating naturalistic progressivism in the English-speaking world.

Combe&#x27;s 1838 &quot;Answers to the Objections Urged Against Phrenology&quot; was followed in 1840 by &quot;Moral Philosophy&quot; and in 1841 by &quot;Notes on the United States of North America&quot;. &quot;Phrenology Applied to Painting and Sculpture&quot; ensued in 1855. The culmination of Combe&#x27;s autobiographical philosophy appeared in &quot;On the Relation between Science and Religion&quot;, first publicly issued in 1857. Combe moved into the economic arena with a pamphlet on &quot;The Currency Question&quot; (1858). A fuller phrenological approach to political economy was set out later by William Ballantyne Hodgson.

==Family==

In 1833, Combe married Cecilia Siddons, daughter of the actress Sarah Siddons and sister of Henry Siddons, author of &quot;Practical Illustrations of Rhetorical Gesture and Action&quot; (1807). She brought him a fortune and a happy, though childless marriage, preceded by a phrenological check for compatibility. A few years later, he retired from the law in comfortable circumstances.

<text>Arapeí is a Brazilian municipality of the eastern part of the state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 2,460 (2020 est.) in an area of 156.90 km². Its bordering cities are Resende and Barra Mansa (both in the state of Rio de Janeiro) in the north, Bananal in the southeast and São José do Barreiro in the west.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Charles Caleb Colton (bapt. 11 December 1777 – 28 April 1832) was an English cleric, writer and collector, well known for his eccentricities.

==Life==
The son of the Rev. Barfoot Colton, he was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1801, and M.A. in 1804. In 1801, he was presented by the college with the perpetual curacy of Tiverton&#x27;s Prior&#x27;s Quarter in Devon, where he lived for many years. He was appointed to the vicarage of Kew and Petersham in 1812. His performance of church-related functions at both locations was erratic: at times conscientious and brilliant while at other times cursory and indulgent. He left formal church service, and England, in 1828. Contemporaries believed that he had fled from his creditors, who took out a legal &quot;docket&quot; against him, identifying him as a wine-merchant.

For two years Colton traveled throughout the United States. He later established a modest residence in Paris. There he invested in an art gallery and had a large private collection of valuable paintings. Other pastimes included wine collecting and partridge-shooting. He also frequented the gaming salons of the &quot;Palais Royal&quot; and was so successful that in a year or two he acquired the equivalent of 25,000 English pounds. He continued gambling, however, and lost his French fortune. At the time of his death, Colton was living on funds received from his immediate family. An illness required surgery, but Colton dreaded the operation. He eventually killed himself rather than undergo the procedure.

==Literary work==
Colton&#x27;s books, including collections of epigrammatic aphorisms and short essays on conduct, though now almost forgotten, had a phenomenal popularity in their day. Toward the end of 1820, Colton published &quot;Lacon, or Many Things in Few Words, addressed to those who think.&quot;, in a small cheap edition. It attracted attention and praise, however, and five additional printings were issued in 1821. &quot;Lacon, Vol. II&quot; appeared in 1822. In 1822, Colton re-published a previous work on Napoleon, with extensive additions, under the title of &quot;The Conflagration of Moscow.&quot; In Paris he printed &quot;An Ode on the Death of Lord Byron&quot; for private circulation and continued to write. At his death he left an unpublished poem of 600 lines called &quot;Modern Antiquity.&quot;

In the twentieth century and to the present day Colton has been read most frequently perhaps in quotation books, including &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;, where many of his aphorisms have been preserved.

<text>William Combe (25 March 174219 June 1823) was a British miscellaneous writer. His early life was that of an adventurer, his later was passed chiefly within the &quot;rules&quot; of the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. He is chiefly remembered as the author of &quot;The Three Tours of Doctor Syntax&quot;, a comic poem, illustrated by artist Thomas Rowlandson&#x27;s colour plates, that satirised William Gilpin. Combe also wrote a series of imaginary letters, supposed to have been written by the second, or &quot;wicked&quot; Lord Lyttelton. Of a similar kind were his letters between Swift and &quot;Stella&quot;. He also wrote the letterpress for various illustrated books, and was a general hack.

== Early life ==
Combe&#x27;s father, Robert Combes, was a rich Bristol ironmonger who died in 1756; his mother, Susannah Hill (died 1748), was from a Quaker background. He was educated at Eton College, but was withdrawn from the school by William Alexander, his guardian, on his father&#x27;s death; Alexander died in 1762. He inherited from both his father and guardian, aspired to the status of gentleman, and changed his name to Combe. He spent his fortune, travelled and was nicknamed &quot;Count Combe&quot;; and in the period 1769–1773 was low in funds, existing in France, Wales and the West Midlands.

In 1773 Robert Berkeley employed Combe to edit Thomas Falkner&#x27;s &quot;Description of Patagonia&quot;. Combe then settled to work as a writer and book editor.

==Works==
In 1776 Combe made his first success in London with &quot;The Diaboliad&quot;, a satire full of bitter personal attacks. Four years later, in 1780, debts brought him into the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, and much of his subsequent life was spent in prison.

Combe&#x27;s spurious &quot;Letters of the Late Lord Lyttelton&quot; (1780) took in many of his contemporaries: as late as 1851, a writer in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; regarded these letters as authentic, basing on them a claim to have solved the riddle of identity of Junius, in Thomas Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton. An early acquaintance with Laurence Sterne resulted in Combe&#x27;s anonymous &quot;Letters supposed to have been written by Yorick and Eliza&quot; (1779), the named characters being from Sterne&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;. Periodical literature of all sorts—pamphlets, satires, burlesques, &quot;two thousand columns for the papers,&quot; &quot;two hundred biographies&quot;—filled up the next years, and about 1789 Combe was receiving £200 yearly from the Pitt government as a pamphleteer.

In 1790 and 91, the six volumes of a &quot;Devil on Two Sticks in England&quot; won for Combe the title of &quot;the English le Sage&quot;. In 1794 he ghost-wrote the Aeneas Anderson memoir of the Lord Macartney embassy to Peking, &quot;A Narrative of the British Embassy to China, in the Years 1792, 1793, and 1794&quot;. In 1794–1796 he wrote the text for Boydell&#x27;s &quot;History of the River Thames&quot;, and in 1803 he began to write for &quot;The Times&quot;. From 1809 to 1811 he wrote for Ackermann&#x27;s &quot;The Poetical Magazine&quot; the serialized comic poem &quot;The Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque&quot;, descriptive and moralizing verse illustrated by artist Thomas Rowlandson&#x27;s color plates. It satirised William Gilpin, who toured Britain to describe his theory of the Picturesque. It was collected in book form in 1812, and was followed by two similar Tours, &quot;...in search of Consolation&quot; (1819) and &quot;...in search of a Wife,&quot; the first Mrs Syntax having died at the end of the first Tour. The second Tour was collected as an 1820 book, and the third tour as an 1821 book. Some reprint editions over the next several decades rendered Rowlandson&#x27;s color plates in black and white.

Then came &quot;Six Poems in illustration of drawings by Princess Elizabeth&quot; (1813), &quot;The English Dance of Death&quot; (1815–1816), &quot;The Dance of Life&quot; (1816–1817), &quot;The Adventures of Johnny Quae Genus&quot; (1822)—all written for Rowlandson&#x27;s caricatures; together with histories of Oxford and Cambridge, and of Westminster Abbey for Ackermann; &quot;Picturesque Tours along the Rhine and other rivers&quot;, &quot;Histories of Madeira&quot;, &quot;Antiquities of York&quot;, texts for Turner&#x27;s &quot;Southern Coast Views&quot;, and contributions innumerable to the &quot;Literary Repository&quot;.

Combe died in London on 19 June 1823.

<text>Henry Constable (1562 – 9 October 1613) was an English poet, known particularly for &quot;Diana&quot;, one of the first English sonnet sequences. In 1591 he converted to Catholicism, and lived in exile on the continent for some years. He returned to England at the accession of King James, but was soon a prisoner in the Tower and in the Fleet. He died an exile at Liège in 1613.

==Family==
Henry Constable, born in Newark-on-Trent in 1562, was the only child of Sir Robert Constable (d. 12 November 1591) and Christiana Dabridgecourt, widow of Anthony Forster, and daughter of John Dabridgecourt of Langdon Hall, Warwickshire. His paternal grandparents were Sir Robert Constable (before 1495 – 29 October 1558) and Katherine Manners, the daughter of George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros, and sister of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland. According to Sullivan, the connections Robert Constable acquired through his marriage &#x27;opened up a career of military service and public office&#x27;. Constable served under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, in the campaign after the Northern Rebellion of 1569, and was knighted by Sussex at Berwick. He was Marshal of Berwick from 1576 to 1578, and was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance at some time before 4 August 1588. In the same year he had a son who was also named Henry, who became a Royalist army officer and the 1st Viscount Dunbar. Other children included daughter, Dorothy Lawson, who became a priest harbourer.

==Career==
Henry Constable matriculated as a fellow commoner at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge at Easter 1578, and took his BA on 29 January 1580. His contemporary at Cambridge was Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. He was enrolled at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 21 February 1583, but there is no further record of his legal studies. On 12 September of that year Constable was in Scotland. He was then posted to Paris on the recommendation of his father&#x27;s friend, Sir Francis Walsingham, serving under the English ambassador there, Sir Edward Stafford, between 14 December 1583 and April 1585. In May 1585 he was at Heidelberg, and he may have travelled to Poland. During this period, according to Sullivan, Constable acted as a spokesperson for Protestant causes.

Constable was probably at the English court during 1588–9, as he is recorded as having attended the funeral of his kinsman, John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland, in March 1588, and as having been in contact with Arabella Stuart in 1589. During this period he was reported to have been one of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s favourites.

He was sent to Edinburgh in 1589 on the occasion of King James VI&#x27;s marriage, and by this time was a member of the circle of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. His religious convictions were still to outward appearances Protestant. About this time he is credited with having written the anonymous tract &quot;Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots&quot;, published in September 1589, in which, according to Sullivan, he wrote as a Roman Catholic urging his countrymen to support Henri IV, who had just been crowned King. Constable seems to have left Scotland with the French diplomat Jean Hotman in October 1589, but returned in 1590, and wrote a sonnet, &quot;To the King of Scotland upon the occasion of his longe stay in Denmarke by reason of the coldnesse of the winter and the freezing of the sea.&quot;

In 1591 Constable went to Normandy with the English forces under Essex who laid siege to Rouen. At some time between his arrival in France and the death of his father on 12 November 1591 Constable openly embraced Roman Catholicism. Henri IV granted him a small pension. For the next decade he was principally based in Paris, but travelled to Rome in 1595. On 3 October 1596 he was in Rouen, from which Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to Sir Robert Cecil that &#x27;Here is Mr. H. Constable; who, lest he should have intruded himself into my company, I desired Mr Edmunds to let him know my desire he should forbear either coming, writing, or sending unto me, which he hath hitherto performed&#x27;. During this period he was also in Antwerp and Brussels. Until 1597 he kept up his connections with the Essex circle, writing to Essex himself and to Anthony Bacon. He continued to claim loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, and supported King James&#x27; claim to the English throne in preference to the claim of the Spanish Infanta, daughter of Philip II of Spain. On 1 March 1599 Constable arrived at Leith in Scotland, and eventually obtained access to King James, remaining until September, &#x27;hunting and conversing on poetry and divinity&#x27; with the King. In 1600 he again travelled to Rome to seek Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s approval of another visit to King James.

On James&#x27;s accession Constable hoped to return to England, and wrote first to friends in Scotland for support, and on 11 June 1603, to his kinsman, Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and to Sir Robert Cecil. By December of that year he was back at court, and was granted a warrant on 8 February 1604 by which he obtained possession of his inherited lands. However his continued pursuit of plans to influence King James towards toleration of Catholics resulted in his imprisonment in the Tower, where he remained from 14 April to 9 July 1604. The Venetian ambassador Nicolò Molin heard that Constable had written letters to the Papal nuncio or envoy in Paris, which were intercepted, leading to his arrest.

Constable was subsequently placed under house arrest, and deprived of his inheritance. He was in the Fleet prison on 11 February 1608, when John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton that no sooner was Sir Tobie Matthew released, and &#x27;no sooner gan nor his nest scant cold, when Harry Constable was committed in his roome and nestles in the same lodging&#x27;. Constable was imprisoned on at least one other occasion. On 31 July 1610 he was granted licence to leave England. He returned to Paris, and on 27 November 1611 rumours of his death were passed on by John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton: &#x27;Sir William Bowes is lately dead, and we hear that Harry Constable hath taken the same way in Fraunce&#x27;. Little more is known of his activities apart from the record of his presence at a theological disputation on 4 September 1612. In 1613 his friend, Cardinal Perron, sent him to Liège on a mission to convert an English Protestant divine, Benjamin Carier. Constable died at Liège on 9 October 1613.

==Literary accomplishments==

In 1592 &quot;Diana&quot;, a sequence of twenty-three sonnets by Constable, was published in London by Richard Smith, one of the first sonnets sequences in English. A second edition, containing five new sonnets by Constable with additions by Sir Philip Sidney and other poets followed in 1594. Sullivan considers that the 1594 publication was undertaken on Richard Smith&#x27;s initiative. There were two further editions in 1597 and 1604. Four poems by Constable were included in &quot;England&#x27;s Helicon&quot; in 1600, among them &quot;Damelus Song to his Diaphenia&quot; and &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. According to W. Carew Hazlitt, &#x27;A more beautiful specimen of early English lyric poetry than &quot;The Sheepheard&#x27;s Song of Venus and Adonis&quot; could hardly be found in the whole circle of Elizabethan poetry&#x27;.

The Todd manuscript contains additional love sonnets by Constable, and Harleian MS 7553 contains seventeen &#x27;Spirituall sonnettes, to the honour of God: and hys saintes&#x27;.

Constable&#x27;s verse is characterised by fervour and richness of colour. Of the numerous sonnets he wrote, the twenty-eight of the sonnet sequence &quot;Diana&quot;, and the four prefixed to Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot;, contain his best work. In &quot;My lady&#x27;s presence makes the roses red&quot;, he is able to capture Spenser&#x27;s charm. His rhyme scheme is mixed Italian and English, like Sidney&#x27;s, the octave being Italian and the sestet English.

Constable was highly reputed as a poet in his day. In the censure of contemporary poets in Act I, Scene ii, of the anonymous Elizabethan play, &quot;The Return From Parnassus&quot;, Iudicio passes judgment favourably on Constable, saying that:
Sweete Constable doth take the wondring eare&lt;br&gt;
And layes it up in willing prisonment.

Ben Jonson also pays tribute to Constable&#x27;s verse in &quot;Underwood&quot;:
Hath our great Sydney Stella set,&lt;br&gt;
Where never star shone brighter yet?&lt;br&gt;
Or Constable&#x27;s ambrosiac muse&lt;br&gt;
Made Diana not his notes refuse

Constable is known to have written two theological tracts in 1596 and 1597 which are no longer extant. He also responded to &quot;A Conference about the Next Succession&quot;, generally attributed to Robert Persons. Constable&#x27;s &quot;Discoverye of a Counterfecte Conference … for Thadvancement of a Counterfecte Tytle&quot;, which supported King James&#x27; claim to the English crown, was printed in Paris in 1600, although the title page falsely claimed that it had been printed in Cologne.

<doc id="996785" wikidata="Q4245664" url="?curid=996785" title="John Esten Cooke">
<text>John Esten Cooke (November 3, 1830 – September 27, 1886) was an American novelist, writer and poet. He was the brother of poet Philip Pendleton Cooke. During the American Civil War, Cooke was a staff officer for Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart in the Confederate States Army cavalry and, after Stuart&#x27;s death, for Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton. Stuart&#x27;s wife, Flora, was a first cousin of Cooke.

==Early life==
Born in Winchester, Virginia on November 3, 1830, Cooke was one of 13 children (five of whom survived childhood) of Bermuda-born planter and lawyer John R. Cooke and Maria Pendleton Cooke. He was born on the family&#x27;s plantation, &quot;Ambler&#x27;s Hill,&quot; near Winchester, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1838, &quot;Glengary&quot;, the family estate to which the Cookes had moved, burned down. The family moved to Charles Town, Virginia and in 1840 to Richmond, Virginia.

At his father&#x27;s urging, Cooke studied and practiced law briefly in Richmond but abandoned that in 1849 when continuing financial problems prevented him from enrolling at the University of Virginia. He formed a law partnership with his father in 1851 but his writing often interfered with his work.

Cooke had several manuscripts published between 1848 and 1853. In 1854, he began to write and publish books. In 1858 after his father&#x27;s death, he gave up the practice of law altogether. After he started writing, he almost immediately became a successful novelist and prolific short story writer, eventually authoring 31 books and almost 200 published articles and poems. He became noted for his writing about Virginia, much of it in historical novels.

Cooke illustrated Virginia life and history in the novels, &quot;The Virginia Comedians&quot; (1854), and later &quot;The Wearing of the Gray&quot;, a tale of the American Civil War, and more formally in a respected Virginia history. His style was somewhat high-flown. He was the author of &quot;The Youth of Jefferson&quot;.

Cooke joined the Richmond Howitzers, a militia artillery unit, in the 1850s, earning the rank of sergeant. He accompanied the unit to Harpers Ferry in response to John Brown&#x27;s raid.

==Civil War==
Cooke fought with the Richmond Howitzers at the First Battle of Bull Run. After the battle, Cooke began to write to newspapers in the South, as &quot;Our Virginia Correspondent,&quot; in order to praise Stuart and campaign for then Col. Stuart&#x27;s promotion, which also was sought by Stuart&#x27;s commanding officer, General Joseph E. Johnston. Stuart was promoted to brigadier general on September 24, 1861.

In March and April 1862, Cooke served as an unpaid volunteer aide for Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. Cooke was a first cousin of General Stuart&#x27;s wife, Flora Cooke Stuart. On May 19, 1862, he was formally commissioned as a lieutenant and officially joined Stuart&#x27;s staff. Cooke participated in the Peninsula Campaign and Stuart&#x27;s subsequent ride around the Union army of George B. McClellan, later writing a detailed description of the action. Cooke served as an ordnance officer until October 1863. Despite Stuart&#x27;s secret dislike for Cooke personally, Stuart praised Cooke&#x27;s service during the Peninsula Campaign and Seven Days&#x27; Battles and sought a promotion for him. Stuart was promoted to major general on July 25, 1862. On June 9, 1863, Cooke and other staff members were drawn into combat at the Battle of Brandy Station.

Cooke also participated in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon after the start of the Stuart&#x27;s ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or captured during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). He was eating breakfast with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III&#x27;s cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton&#x27;s division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.

During the war, Cooke served Stuart as an aide, ordnance officer, and assistant adjutant general, earning the rank of captain. On October 27, 1863, Stuart made Cooke an adjutant in order to put his writing talent to work in catching up on his paperwork.

Although Cooke wrote favorably about Stuart during and after the war, Stuart confidentially told Flora (but not Cooke himself) that he did not like Cooke and found him boring.

Following Stuart&#x27;s death at Yellow Tavern in May 1864, Cooke served as an adjutant on the staff of Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, eventually rising to the rank of major by the end of the war.

==Postbellum career==

In 1867, Cooke married Mary Frances Page and settled down at the former home of Daniel Morgan, Saratoga, near Boyce, Virginia, to become a marginally prosperous farmer and gardener as well as an author. The Cookes had three children. To Cooke&#x27;s great grief, Mary Frances died on January 15, 1878.

Historian Emory M. Thomas wrote: &quot;John Esten Cooke used and embellished his in-law&#x27;s fame in a series of stories and novels that made Cooke famous. He never knew that Stuart thought him an enormous bore.&quot; In 1869 and 1870, Cooke published a trilogy of Civil War novels: &quot;Hilt to Hilt: Days and Nights on the Banks of the Shenandoah in the Autumn of 1864&quot;; &quot;Mohun: or, The Last Days of Lee and His Paladins: Final Memoirs Of A Staff Officer Serving In Virginia. From The Mss. Of Colonel Surry, Of Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;; and &quot;Hammer and Rapier&quot;.

Even before the end of the war, in 1863, Cooke wrote the first of several popular biographies, &quot;Stonewall Jackson: A Military Biography&quot;, published in 1876, for which he received some contemporary criticism for the errors in the book. He earlier published a novel on Jackson, &quot;Surry of Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1866). His later efforts at biography, such as a biography of Robert E. Lee and officers that he had personally known, were considered more accurate than his early Jackson biography. In his declining years, his works showed the same style that he had used earlier in life, not showing any growth or development.

John Esten Cooke died of typhoid fever at his home, &quot;The Briars,&quot; on September 27, 1886. Cooke was buried in Old Chapel Cemetery in Millwood, Virginia.

==John Esten Cooke Fiction Award==
The John Esten Cooke Fiction Award is given &quot;annually to encourage writers of fiction to portray characters and events dealing with the Civil War, Confederate heritage, or Southern history in a historically accurate fashion.&quot; The $1,000 grant and award competition, open to book-length works, is judged on &quot;effectiveness of research, accuracy of statement, and excellence of style.&quot; The Cooke Fiction Award is one of three literary prizes given annually by the Military Order of the Stars and Bars.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-12 (, also transcribed as Jak-12, NATO reporting name: &quot;Creek&quot;) is a light multirole STOL aircraft used by the Soviet Air Forces, Soviet civilian aviation and other countries from 1947 onwards.

==Design and development==
The Yak-12 was designed by Alexander Yakovlev&#x27;s team to meet a requirement of the Soviet Air Force of 1944 for a new liaison and utility plane, to replace the obsolete Po-2 biplane. It was also meant to be used in civil aviation as a successor to Yakovlev&#x27;s AIR-6 of 1934, built in a relatively small series. Yakovlev&#x27;s first proposal was a four-place high-wing aircraft, the Yak-10 (first named Yak-14), built in January 1945. It won the competition with a low-wing Yak-13, based on the same fuselage, and a series of 40 Yak-10s were produced, powered with a 108 kW (145 hp) Shvetsov M-11M radial engine.

In 1947, Yakovlev developed a new aircraft to replace the Yak-10. This was fitted with a more powerful 119 kW (160 hp) M-11FR, a new wing and undercarriage, and a fuselage with a revised shape (lower tail). The new type was designated Yak-12, first flying in 1947. 788 of the basic variant were produced, including military observation planes, some Yak-12S air ambulances, Yak-12SKh agricultural aircraft and Yak-12GR floatplanes. A distinguishing feature of the basic Yak-12, just like the Yak-10, were engine cylinders with individual cowlings. It was a plane of a mixed construction and could take 1 or 2 passengers, apart from a pilot.

The next generation Yak-12 entered production in 1952, starting with the Yak-12R. It was fitted with a new 194 kW (260 hp) Ivchenko AI-14R radial engine and all-metal construction. The wing area increased (from 21.6 m2 to 23.8 m2). This variant had the least wing loading of all Yak-12s, and therefore the best STOL performance (take-off run 52 m/171 ft, landing 81 m/266 ft).

After being lengthened to improve weight distribution, with further strengthening of the structure and other minor changes, from 1955 the Yak-12M (&quot;modernized&quot;) was produced. A visible difference was a lengthened, curved tailfin. This variant became more universal, offering a bigger payload. It took a pilot and 3 passengers and could be fitted with dual controls for training, a stretcher for an ambulance role or an agricultural spraying device. It became the most numerous variant.

The last generation, produced from 1957, was the Yak-12A. It was an aerodynamically refined variant, with a slimmer fuselage and a new wing. The cowling was smaller diameter. The rectangular wings were fitted with trapezoidal ends and automatic slats, and single struts replaced twin struts. Navigation equipment and controls were improved, and performance also increased. In the USSR, 3,801 Yak-12s were built in all models (including 3,013 Yak-12R, M and A). An experimental Yak-12B biplane was also developed, but did not enter production.

The Yak-12M was licence-built from 1956 in Poland as the WSK-4 Okecie, or Jak-12M (Polish spelling of Russian name). From 1959, the Yak-12A was built in Poland (1,054 Jak-12Ms, 137 Jak-12As), most for export to the USSR. In 1958, further development of the Yak-12M was carried out in Poland, becoming the PZL-101 Gawron.

The Yak-12 was also produced in China as Shenyang type 5.

==Operational history==
Yak-12s first entered service in the Soviet Air Force as a liaison and artillery observation plane. Then, they were used also in the Soviet civilian aviation – mostly in the DOSAAF aero club for transport, pilot training, parachute training, and glider towing. They were also used as air ambulances and agricultural aircraft.

Apart from the Soviet Union, Yak-12s were used in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia (civil and military), and Hungary (civil). Licence-built Shenyangs were used in China and other countries. In some countries, including Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the Russian name was transcribed as Jak-12.

In the Polish Air Force, about 90 Yak-12s were used from 1951, as liaison, patrol, and general utility planes. Most were withdrawn in the 1970s, the last in the 1980s. Most were next handed over to civil aviation. In Poland, the first civilian model was acquired in 1952, and larger numbers were used from the 1960s (at least 79). They were used mostly in regional aeroclubs for pilot training, parachute training, transport, and glider towing. 21 were used as air ambulances.

Some civil Yak-12s (mostly Yak-12A) remained in use as of 2006.

On July 12, 2012, a Yak-12 chartered by Canada&#x27;s Kinross Gold Corporation, crashed shortly after takeoff from an airport in Nouakchott, Mauritania.

==Description==
They were braced high-wing monoplanes of metal construction (Yak-12R, M, A) or mixed construction (Yak-12), conventional in layout, and covered in metal and canvas. The wings were fitted with flaps and slats (automatic slats in Yak-12R and A, or fixed in other variants). There was a four-seat cabin (in early variants of Yak-12 – 2 or 3 seats), and a conventional fixed landing gear with tail wheel.

There was a single radial engine: 5-cylinder M-11FR (nominal power 104 kW/140 hp, take-off power 118 kW/160 hp) – Yak-12 basic variant; 9-cylinder AI-14R (nominal power 161 kW/220 hp, take-off power 191 kW/260 hp) – Yak-12R, M and A.

The planes had a two-blade propeller, and two fuel tanks in the wings (225 L (55 US gal) each).

<text>Joseph Harry Guy Carbonneau (born March 18, 1960) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, coach and executive in the National Hockey League. He was also the president of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Chicoutimi Saguenéens. Carbonneau was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in November 2019.

==Playing career==
Carbonneau started his hockey career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with the Chicoutimi Saguenéens. After an impressive 182-point season with the Sagueneens, Carbonneau was drafted 44th overall in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. His strong play as a defensive forward helped the Canadiens to a Stanley Cup championship in 1985–86, followed by three Frank J. Selke Trophy wins in 1987–1988, 1988–1989, and 1991–1992. In 1989–1990, he was named the captain of the Canadiens, and led them to another Stanley Cup win in 1992–93 against the Los Angeles Kings. On August 19, 1994, he was traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Jim Montgomery. He played there for one season before moving to the Dallas Stars. He won his third Stanley Cup in 1998–1999 with the Stars. Next season, Carbonneau and the Stars reached the Stanley Cup Finals again but this time they lost to the New Jersey Devils. Carbonneau retired shortly after that.

Carbonneau was one of the more popular Canadiens; fans chanted &quot;Guy, Guy, Guy!&quot; whenever he touched the puck, much as they did for Guy Lafleur (with whom Carbonneau played from 1982–1985) during his career. He was also one of the most admired Dallas Stars players. He took the ceremonial opening faceoff for the Stars when they played the Canadiens at the last game at the Montreal Forum.

==Post-playing career==
In 2005, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League created the Guy Carbonneau Trophy (Trophée Guy Carbonneau), awarded annually to the player in the QMJHL judged to be the best defensive forward.

After serving as an assistant coach to Michel Therrien with the Canadiens from 2000 to 2002, Carbonneau moved back to the Dallas Stars where he worked as an assistant general manager (he was named to the position on May 26, 2002), until his return to Montreal in January 2006.

On January 14, 2006, Carbonneau became the Montreal Canadiens associate coach, as Claude Julien was fired and GM Bob Gainey assumed the role of interim head coach. Carbonneau became head coach, after the Canadiens were eliminated from the playoffs. He was the 28th coach of the Montreal team.

On April 30, 2008, he was named a candidate for the Jack Adams Award awarded to the best head coach of the year, but lost by 12 points to Washington Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau.

On March 9, 2009, he was fired as the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens with 16 games left. He was replaced by general manager Bob Gainey.

On September 17, 2009, Carbonneau became an analyst for CBC Sports &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. He left CBC after the 2009–2010 season and joined Réseau des sports as an analyst. He also appeared in the first season (2010) of La série Montréal-Québec as the head coach for the Montreal team.

On February 7, 2011, Carbonneau became head coach of the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, the team he co-owns. He resigned in July 2011.

On June 25, 2019, Carbonneau was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Awards and achievements==

* Coach, Canadian national team, Maccabiah Games 2017, Gold medal winner.
* Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 2019.

<doc id="996798" wikidata="Q10843451" url="?curid=996798" title="Institute of Ismaili Studies">
<text>The Institute of Ismaili Studies (IIS) is a research institute in London, United Kingdom. It aims to promote the study of Muslim cultures and societies, both historical and contemporary, in order to foster a greater understanding of their relationships with other societies and faiths. It also functions as a gathering point for the Ismaili community as it endeavors to understand its own history and thought, including the often neglected fields of esoteric Islam and Shi&#x27;ism.

The institute draws upon the worldwide knowledge and experience of various institutions and scholars to create awareness through initiatives, publications, and partnerships in the field of Islamic Studies. Its library, which houses the largest-known accessible collection of Ismaili codices in the world, is a major resource in the field. In addition to its research, the IIS offers two graduate programmes: the Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities (GPISH) and the Secondary Teacher Education Programme (STEP).

Established in 1977 by the Aga Khan, it functions under his guidance and works closely with the Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilizations at the Aga Khan University.

==History and conceptualization==
===Ismaili Society===

Modern Ismaili studies first began in the 1930s in South Asia, where collections of Ismaili manuscripts had been preserved within Ismaili communities and brought to the fore through the pioneering efforts of Wladimir Ivanow, Asaf Fyzee, Husayn al-Hamdani, and Zahid Ali. Much of this early work helped to dispel the writings of the nineteenth century orientalists, which were often defamatory albeit unintentionally, having drawn only on the sources of the Ismailis&#x27; adversaries, while over-sensationalizing occidental accounts. Ivanow, in particular, played an important role in the creation of the Ismaili Society of Bombay, which was, in a sense, a precursor to the institute.

The former Ismaili Society of Bombay was established under the patronage of Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in February 1946. The Ismaili Society stood for &quot;the promotion of independent and critical study of all matters connected with Ismailism&quot; and frequently published monographs, critical editions of original texts and collections of short papers. Like the institute, the society&#x27;s work was involved in studying the field of particular intellectual movements in Islam, with a specific interest in Shi&#x27;ism and Sufism. With these underlying premises, the Aga Khan chaired the Ismailia Association Conference in April 1975: a four-day meeting in Paris during which groundwork was laid for what was eventually to become the Institute of Ismaili Studies. In November 1977, the Aga Khan made a public announcement that formally proclaimed the inauguration of the institute. In his remarks the Aga Khan expressed his wish that the institute become a major institution for his community, while reflecting upon the Fatimid centres of learning established by his ancestors a millennium before.

===Tradition of learning===

The late Aga Khan III was instrumental in the transformation of Aligarh University, for which he campaigned starting as early as 1896. He also articulated the Muslims&#x27; need for a &quot;Central University&quot; – a place where religion and learning are never divorced and individuality is safeguarded from imitating other cultures – so that early in their lives, students would gain a sense &quot;for truthfulness, and for independence of character&quot;. In subsequent years, Aga Khan III founded many schools in East Africa and South Asia. Most of these schools continue to exist today. He and his forefathers trace their ancestry back to the Fatimid Caliph-Imams who were among the first Muslims to establish institutes of higher learning in the history of Islamic civilization. Therefore, despite its recent foundation, the institute draws upon a long historical tradition that is firmly rooted in education and learning and equally cognizant thereof.

===Governance===

The institute operates under a Board of Governors of which the Aga Khan is chairman. Board members as of September 2022 include: Professor Ali Asani, Dr. Nadia Eboo Jamal, Karina Govindji, Dr. Arif Jamal, Professor Farid F Panjwani, Alykhan Kassam, Amyn Kassim-Lakha, Dr. Sharofat Mamadambarova, Naguib Kheraj, Professor Nacim Pak-Shiraz, Habib Motani, Professor Tashmin Khamis, Dr. Shogufa Mir Malekyar, and Rahim Kara.

Dr. Farhad Daftary stepped down as co-director in September 2022, and took on the title of director emeritus. Dr. Zayn Kassam began her term as Director on 9 January 2023.

==Library and publications==

The Institute of Ismaili Studies Library was established in 1979 and is a major resource at the institute, which houses the largest-known accessible collection of Ismaili codices in the world. Its role is to preserve, develop and make available a central archive of Ismaili manuscripts, printed texts and audiovisual materials, and to support the activities and programmes of the institute by providing necessary resources. The library&#x27;s collection comprises some thirty thousand items, including rare manuscripts in Arabic, Persian and Gujarati. Many of these manuscripts are described in published catalogues.

The library also actively seeks to expand its holdings through new acquisitions, donations and by obtaining photocopies and microfilms of manuscripts that are held in various private and institutional collections. The library&#x27;s collection has benefited from a number of private collections that have been donated such as the Dr. Zahid Ali collection of two hundred twenty rare manuscripts, and the Sherali Alidina collection. Much of the early collection, however, predates the foundation of the institute and represents the holdings of the Ismaili Society of Mumbai.

===Publications===

The institute&#x27;s publications are manifold and range from curriculum materials to translations and academic publications. They reflect its mandate of promoting modern scholarship in the area of Islamic studies. Most of the works are published through Islamic Publications Ltd. (IPL) in association with I.B. Tauris &amp; Co. Ltd..

The collection of curriculum materials produced by the institute&#x27;s Department of Education for the religious and cultural education of the Ismaili community is known as the Ta&#x27;lim Programme. This curriculum is currently available at primary levels for ages four to twelve in eight different languages. The curriculum is also expected to further expand for students at a secondary school level in the near future. Seven types of academic publications are produced by the institute, as listed below:

#Occasional papers or essays addressing broad themes on the relationship between religion and society, with special reference to Islam;
#Monographs that explore specific aspects of the Islamic religions tradition;
#Significant editions or translations of primary or secondary texts pertinent to the understanding of Islam;
#Translations of poetic and literary texts, which illustrate the rich heritage of spiritual, devotional and symbolic expressions in Muslim history;
#Works pertaining to Ismailism;
#Proceedings of conferences and seminars sponsored by the institute;
#Bibliographical works or catalogues.

==Programmes==

The Institute of Ismaili Studies offers a variety of different programmes from the graduate level to preparatory programmes for Ismaili students who have not previously studied English, such as the Khorog English Programme and the Syrian Preparatory Program.

===Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities===

The Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities (GPISH) has a three-year duration. It aims to &quot;engender a sympathetic yet critical examination of issues facing contemporary Muslims, from the debate amongst Muslim intellectuals regarding the re-examination of aspects of the Islamic heritage to the challenges posed by modernisation and development.&quot; The goal of the program is to prepare students for a research degree and a wide variety of career opportunities.

It focuses on Islam in general, and in particular on Shi&#x27;ism and the Ismaili community, its history, and its teachings as understood within the Islamic religious tradition. The programme integrates a variety of disciplines into the study of Muslim societies, including history, anthropology, political science, philosophical analysis, literature, aesthetics, art, and the study of religion. After two years of theory based learning, students embark on a field project during the summer of their second academic year. The final year of the programme is spent at a degree-granting university in the UK, where students study for a master&#x27;s degree in a discipline that is resonant with the aims of the graduate programme.

All admitted students are provided with a full scholarship that covers tuition and housing, as well as a stipend covering living expenses. The institute also provides doctoral scholarships to suitable candidates, and preference is given those who have completed GPISH.

===Secondary Teacher Education Programme===

Founded in 2002, The Secondary Teacher Education Programme (STEP) is a two-year post-graduate programme that seeks to train and sustain teachers who will be instrumental in teaching the institute&#x27;s Secondary Curriculum to Ismaili students worldwide. It culminates in an MTeach and an MA in education (Muslim Societies and Civilizations), both awarded by the University of London, and is the product of a partnership between Institute of Ismaili Studies and the University of London&#x27;s Institute of Education.

Following the completion of the academic portion of the STEP program, students return to their home countries and participate in an in-service phase at their national Ismaili Tariqah and Religious Education Board/Committee (ITREB/C). Students are provided with a full scholarship and stipend that covers the entire program (including the home-based practicum), and related travel expenses.

The programme is currently open to applicants from thirteen countries: Canada, France, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Portugal, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, UAE, Uganda, UK and the USA.

<text>Avaré is a city in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, located 270 km from the state capital, São Paulo. The population is 91,232 (2020 est.) in an area of 1213 km2. Established on 15 September 1861 by Major Vitoriano de Souza Rocha and Domiciano Santana, the city was developed around the chapel of Our Lady of the Good Death (&quot;Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte&quot;).

The economy is based on agriculture, cattle ranching and tourism. The &quot;Jurumirim Hydroelectric Dam&quot; in the Paranapanema River is situated near Avaré. The city has its own airport, Avaré-Arandu Airport.

Tourism is an important aspect in Avaré, which today is virtually a large ranch. Traditional events occur throughout the year, such as the Feira das Nações (&quot;Fair of the Nations&quot;), where typical foods of various countries are served, and the FAMPOP, (Fair of Popular Music), whose objective is to highlight and award singers, musicians and composers. Natural attractions such as &quot;Terra da Água, do Verde e do Sol&quot; (&quot;Land of water, the green, and the sun&quot;) also invite tourists to the beauty of Avaré&#x27;s large reservoir.

The city is also distinguished as a center of higher education. Many students from the surrounding region come to Avaré seeking a quality education and a chance to study. The &quot;Faculdade Sudoeste Paulista&quot; (São Paulo State Southwest College) and other higher education institutions are located there.

<doc id="996808" wikidata="Q579338" url="?curid=996808" title="Standard gravitational parameter">
<text>The standard gravitational parameter &quot;μ&quot; of a celestial body is the product of the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; and the mass &quot;M&quot; of that body. For two bodies, the parameter may be expressed as , or as when one body is much larger than the other:
formula_1

For several objects in the Solar System, the value of &quot;μ&quot; is known to greater accuracy than either &quot;G&quot; or &quot;M&quot;. The SI unit of the standard gravitational parameter is . However, the unit is frequently used in the scientific literature and in spacecraft navigation.

== Definition ==
=== Small body orbiting a central body ===

The central body in an orbital system can be defined as the one whose mass (&quot;M&quot;) is much larger than the mass of the orbiting body (&quot;m&quot;), or . This approximation is standard for planets orbiting the Sun or most moons and greatly simplifies equations. Under Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, if the distance between the bodies is &quot;r&quot;, the force exerted on the smaller body is:
formula_2

Thus only the product of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;M&quot; is needed to predict the motion of the smaller body. Conversely, measurements of the smaller body&#x27;s orbit only provide information on the product, &quot;μ&quot;, not &quot;G&quot; and &quot;M&quot; separately. The gravitational constant, &quot;G&quot;, is difficult to measure with high accuracy, while orbits, at least in the solar system, can be measured with great precision and used to determine &quot;μ&quot; with similar precision.

For a circular orbit around a central body, where the centripetal force provided by gravity is :
formula_3
where &quot;r&quot; is the orbit radius, &quot;v&quot; is the orbital speed, &quot;ω&quot; is the angular speed, and &quot;T&quot; is the orbital period.

This can be generalized for elliptic orbits:
formula_4
where &quot;a&quot; is the semi-major axis, which is Kepler&#x27;s third law.

For parabolic trajectories &quot;rv&quot;2 is constant and equal to 2&quot;μ&quot;. For elliptic and hyperbolic orbits magnitude of &quot;μ&quot; = 2 times the magnitude of &quot;a&quot; times the magnitude of &quot;ε&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the semi-major axis and &quot;ε&quot; is the specific orbital energy.

=== General case ===
In the more general case where the bodies need not be a large one and a small one, e.g. a binary star system, we define:
* the vector r is the position of one body relative to the other
* &quot;r&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and in the case of an elliptic orbit, the semi-major axis &quot;a&quot;, are defined accordingly (hence &quot;r&quot; is the distance)
* &quot;μ&quot; = &quot;Gm&quot;1 + &quot;Gm&quot;2 = &quot;μ&quot;1 + &quot;μ&quot;2, where &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 are the masses of the two bodies.

Then:
* for circular orbits, &quot;rv&quot;2 = &quot;r&quot;3&quot;ω&quot;2 = 4π2&quot;r&quot;3/&quot;T&quot;2 = &quot;μ&quot;
* for elliptic orbits, (with &quot;a&quot; expressed in AU; &quot;T&quot; in years and &quot;M&quot; the total mass relative to that of the Sun, we get )
* for parabolic trajectories, &quot;rv&quot;2 is constant and equal to 2&quot;μ&quot;
* for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits, &quot;μ&quot; is twice the semi-major axis times the negative of the specific orbital energy, where the latter is defined as the total energy of the system divided by the reduced mass.

=== In a pendulum ===
The standard gravitational parameter can be determined using a pendulum oscillating above the surface of a body as:

formula_5
where &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the gravitating body, &quot;L&quot; is the length of the pendulum, and &quot;T&quot; is the period of the pendulum (for the reason of the approximation see Pendulum in mechanics).

== Solar system ==
=== Geocentric gravitational constant ===

&quot;G&quot;, the gravitational parameter for the Earth as the central body, is called the geocentric gravitational constant. It equals .

The value of this constant became important with the beginning of spaceflight in the 1950s, and great effort was expended to determine it as accurately as possible during the 1960s. Sagitov (1969) cites a range of values reported from 1960s high-precision measurements, with a relative uncertainty of the order of 10−6.

During the 1970s to 1980s, the increasing number of artificial satellites in Earth orbit further facilitated high-precision measurements, 
and the relative uncertainty was decreased by another three orders of magnitude, to about (1 in 500 million) as of 1992. 
Measurement involves observations of the distances from the satellite to Earth stations at different times, which can be obtained to high accuracy using radar or laser ranging.

=== Heliocentric gravitational constant ===

&quot;G&quot;, the gravitational parameter for the Sun as the central body, 
is called the heliocentric gravitational constant or &quot;geopotential of the Sun&quot; and equals 

The relative uncertainty in &quot;G&quot;, cited at below 10−10 as of 2015, is smaller than the uncertainty in &quot;G&quot; 
because &quot;G&quot; is derived from the ranging of interplanetary probes, and the absolute error of the distance measures to them is about the same as the earth satellite ranging measures, while the absolute distances involved are much bigger.

<text>Soesterberg is a town in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Soest, and lies about 5 km northeast of Zeist, on the road between Amersfoort and Utrecht. It was the location of Soesterberg Air Base

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in 1840 as Berg, meaning hill belonging to Soest. In 1840, it was home to 253 people. The military airbase and the tram line Amersfoort–Zeist caused a rapid growth of the village in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1939, a monastery was established by the Society of the Divine Word. In 1940, an officer&#x27;s casino was built for the German Luftwaffe. It is one of the few remaining buildings in Nazi architectural style in the Netherlands, and has thick walls. It was captured intact by the Canadians in 1945, and was used by the KLM and Ministry of Defence. It has been converted into an apartment building.

In 1837, a Catholic church was built which was replaced between 1952 and 1953 by the Carolus Borromeus Church.

==Soesterberg Air Base==

In 1910, the heathland north of the village was used as an airfield. The Dutch Airforce (then called LuchtVaartafdeling or LVa, literally airdriving department) was established here in 1913. From 1954 to 1994, Soesterberg Air Base became a NATO base for the United States Air Force 32nd FS (originally 512th FDS later it became 32nd FD, 32nd FIS, and 32nd TFS), and the village of Soesterberg housed a number of American families. The 32nd is the only US military unit that has been under direct operational control of a foreign nation (operational control fell to the Dutch military). It was the home of the Dutch army helicopter force until the base&#x27;s closure in 2010 due to the reduction of the Dutch military establishment. It is now the location of the Nationaal Militair Museum, which opened in 2014. Nearby is the site of the Lockerbie trial of Libyan agents who blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.

Today the Dutch Ministry of Defence still operate a few facilities around the airbase.

<doc id="996816" wikidata="Q1960767" url="?curid=996816" title="Thomas Cooper (poet)">
<text>Thomas Cooper (20 March 1805 – 15 July 1892) was an English poet and a leading Chartist. His prison rhyme the &quot;Purgatory of Suicides&quot; (1845) runs to 944 stanzas. He also wrote novels and in later life religious texts. He was self-educated and worked as a shoemaker, then a preacher, a schoolmaster and a journalist, before taking up Chartism in 1840. He was seen as a passionate, determined and fiery man.

==Early years==
Cooper was born in Leicester, the son of a working dyer. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother began business as a dyer and fancy box-maker at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and young Cooper was apprenticed to a shoemaker. In spite of hardships and difficulties, he managed to educate himself, and at the age of 23, having been a shoemaker in Gainsborough, managed to open a school there in 1827. He had moved to Lincoln by 1834 and married Susannah Chaloner, a cousin of George Boole in that year. His wife died in 1880. He joined the Lincoln Mechanics&#x27; Institute in 1834 and shortly afterwards was on the Committee of Institute. He probably remained on it until he left Lincoln in 1838. 

==Chartist leader and lecturer==
After journal work in Lincoln and London, where he for a couple of months edited &quot;The Kentish Mercury&quot; from Greenwich, Cooper joined the staff of the &quot;Leicestershire Mercury&quot; in 1840 and moved to Leicester. Leicester under his leadership became a Chartist stronghold, with its own journals, such as the &quot;Commonwealthman&quot;, and a school for adults. He became a leader and lecturer among them and in 1843 was imprisoned in Stafford for two years after inciting riots in the Staffordshire Potteries in 1842. He used this time to write his &quot;Purgatory of Suicides&quot;, a political epic. However, Cooper abandoned full-time radicalism on his release.

In his efforts to publish his work after his liberation Cooper came to the notice of Benjamin Disraeli and Douglas Jerrold. With Jerrold&#x27;s help, the work appeared in 1845, and Cooper then turned his attention to lecturing on historical and educational subjects.

==Writing and lecturing==
While working on various papers, Cooper in 1850 ran &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Journal,&quot; but only a few issues appeared. At the same time he adopted sceptical views, which he continued to hold until 1855, when he reconverted to Christianity, joined the Baptists, and was a preacher among them. According to his autobiography, he publicly announced his recovered faith during a lecture at London&#x27;s Hall of Science on 13 January 1856, and began to challenge sceptics to debate. Though still calling himself a Chartist, he sought to earn a living and a reputation as a writer. In addition to his poems, he wrote several novels, although those like &quot;Alderman Ralph&quot; (1853) failed on both counts.

Although he had abandoned his religious beliefs at the time of his imprisonment, Cooper&#x27;s next 30 years were spent as a lecturer in defence of Christianity, attacking the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel. He authored &quot;Evolution, The Stone Book, and The Mosaic Record of Creation&quot; (1878), which argued for creationism and rejected evolution.

Cooper was impulsive, but an honest, sincere man. His autobiography (1872) is seen as a minor Victorian classic. In his later years he settled into being an old-fashioned Radical. His friends in 1867 raised an annuity for him, and in the last year of his life he received a government pension. He died in Lincoln on 15 July 1892 and was buried there.

==Legacy ==
The Thomas Cooper Memorial Baptist Church in Lincoln, built in 1972, is named in his honour. Its previous 1886 building was known as the Thomas Cooper Memorial Mission.

Cooper&#x27;s main works were:

<text>Bishop Richard Corbet (or Corbett) (158228 July 1635) was an English clergyman who rose to be a bishop in the Church of England. He is also remembered as a humorist and as a poet, although his work was not published until after his death.

==Life==
He was born in Ewell in Surrey the son of a prominent nurseryman in Twickenham, Richard Corbet was educated at Westminster School and then studied at both Broadgates Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining his Master of Arts (MA) in 1605. 

Having then taken holy orders (he was, irregularly, ordained both deacon and priest on the same day, 26 March 1613, by John Bridges, Bishop of Oxford), he became a Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1617. In consideration of his preaching, which included an oration on the death of the heir to the throne (Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales), James VI and I made him one of the royal chaplains. He also held a number of other positions, including Dean of Christ Church (1620–28), later becoming Bishop of Oxford (1628) and then Bishop of Norwich (1632). He was nominated to the See of Oxford on 30 July 1628 and translated to Norwich on 7 May 1632. He was generally an easy-going man and, although he was anti-Puritan and wrote against them, did little to repress Puritan activities around Norwich when William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, began his campaign against them.

Corbet was also renowned for his humour and many anecdotes were told of him throughout his career. One of those recorded by John Aubrey recalls how &quot;On a market-day he and some of his comrades were at the taverne by the Crosse… The ballad-singer complayned he had no custome, he could not put off his ballads. The jolly Doctor puts off his gowne, and puts on the ballad-singer&#x27;s leathern jacket, and being a handsome man, and a rare full voice, he presently vended a great many, and had a great audience.

Later he appropriated the form of the sung ballad so as to break down the distinction between different kinds of audience and make its intermediary possibilities available for wider dispersal of his particular views. One included &quot;The Distracted Puritan&quot;, with its satirical characterisation of ostentatious religiosity. Though written in the form of a personal justification, its setting to the tune &quot;Tom O&#x27; Bedlam&quot;, a frequent accompaniment to ballads about madness, signals how the words are really to be taken. Another line of attack occurs in his &quot;A proper new ballad entitled Fairies’ Farewell&quot;, a lament for folk tradition undermined by Puritan prohibitions. Frequent later reprintings have treated it as a piece of charming lore, but the choice of a tune originally associated with lament makes its message clear. The true subject is social friction and the breakdown of trust that has brought.

==Poetry==
Corbet spent much of his life in Oxford, where it is possible that he knew the younger men Henry King and Jasper Mayne, both educated like him at Westminster School and Christ Church, and fellow contributors of poetical tributes to Donne&#x27;s collected poems. Certainly he knew Ben Jonson, whom he was partly instrumental in inviting to Oxford in 1616. Jonson also wrote a companion piece to Corbet&#x27;s own poetical tribute to his father Vincent after his death in 1619. 

In his own day, Corbet&#x27;s reputation was high and his poems were circulated widely in manuscript. Most, according to Anthony Wood, were &quot;made in his younger years, and never intended to be published&quot;. Their first book publication was in &quot;Certain Elegant Poems&quot; (London, 1647), edited by John Donne the Younger. This was little more than a patchwork of twenty-two poor and sometimes spurious texts. &quot;Poëtica Stromata&quot;, a second and entirely separate foreign edition appeared in the following year, consisting of twenty-five poems (only fourteen of which had appeared in the 1647 edition). After another London edition in 1672, there were no more until the augmented fourth edition of Octavius Gilchrist (London 1807). In the 20th century there was a scholarly edition by J A W Bennett and Hugh Trevor-Roper (Oxford 1955).

Humour often characterised his written work. In a prose appeal for the refurbishment of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he described how the building had suffered a double martyrdom by fire and continues: “Saint Paul complained of stoning twice; his church of firing: stoning she wants indeed, and a good stoning would repair her.” His elegy for John Donne, the dean of St Paul&#x27;s, makes the same point as many others accompanying the posthumous collection of Donne&#x27;s poems. To write on this subject, one must first be like the author, he argues, but then concludes that since Donne is now dead he would rather not proceed so far.

Some of Corbet&#x27;s poems have the same uneven rhythms of Donne and other contemporary writers, and are touched by the same Baroque spirit of exaggeration. A fair example occurs in &quot;An elegy upon the Lady Haddington, who died of the small-pox&quot;, where the disease is addressed thus:
::Thou, that of faces honeycombs dost make,
::And of two breasts two cullenders, forsake
::Thy deadly trade: thou now art rich; give o’er,
::And let our curses call thee forth no more;
::Or if thou needs wilt magnify thy power,
::Go where thou art invoked every hour –
::Amongst the gamesters, where they name thee thick.

He wrote several more elegies besides and joined with fellow wits in making fun of Thomas Coryat’s &quot;Crudities&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot; 1807, pp.11–12). Verse letters indicate the Court circle of royal favourites and their dependents among whom he moved, being addressed to John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Thomas Aylesbury. His more original subjects are accounts of journeys: the burlesque &quot;Journey to France&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot; 1807, p.94 ff), and the satirical account of a tour from Oxford to Newark, &quot;Iter Boreale&quot; (p.171ff). Much else is occasional and his authorship is often more a matter of ascription than certainty.

<text>William Johnson Cory (9 January 1823 – 11 June 1892), born William Johnson, was an English educator and poet. He was dismissed from his post at Eton for encouraging a culture of intimacy, possibly non-sexual, between teachers and pupils. He is widely known for his English version of the elegy &quot;Heraclitus&quot; by Callimachus.

==Life==
He was born at Great Torrington in Devon, and educated at Eton, where he was afterwards a renowned master, nicknamed &quot;Tute&quot; (short for &quot;tutor&quot;) by his pupils. After Eton, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship, he studied at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for an English poem on Plato in 1843, and the Craven Scholarship in 1844. He was a writer of Latin verse as well as English verse. Although best known for the much-anthologised &quot;Heraclitus&quot;, an adaptation of an elegy by Callimachus, (&quot;They told me Heraclitus, they told me you were dead&quot;), his chief poetical work is the collection &quot;Ionica&quot;.

Cory became an assistant master at Eton in 1845 just after graduating from King&#x27;s. He insisted on the centrality of personal ties between teacher and student. The historian G. W. Prothero described him as &quot;the most brilliant Eton tutor of his day&quot;. Arthur Coleridge described him as &quot;the wisest master who has ever been at Eton&quot;. Among his former pupils are numbered several statesmen of the period, including Lord Rosebery, Captain Algernon Drummond, Henry Scott Holland, Howard Overing Sturgis, Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax and Arthur Balfour. He wrote the lyrics of the &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot;, first performed in 1863.

=== Resignation ===
Johnson was forced to resign from Eton at Easter 1872 after an &quot;indiscreet letter&quot; that he had written to a pupil was intercepted by the boy&#x27;s parents and brought to the notice of the headmaster. Although it has been suggested that Johnson was a devoted paederast who numbered among his paramours Reginald Brett, the future Lord Esher, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; maintains that this cannot be proved and that &quot;No one can be quite sure of the exact circumstances of his resignation,&quot; adding: &quot;There is no question, however, that he was dangerously fond of a number of boys. Although he probably did not allow his affections to take any physical form, he permitted intimacies between the boys. This conduct was brought to the notice of the headmaster, James Hornby, who demanded Johnson&#x27;s resignation.&quot; In dismissing Johnson, Hornby commented that it was not for committing acts of “immorality in the ordinary sense of the word”, meaning sodomy in the euphemism of the era, and an alternative view of Johnson&#x27;s dismissal is given by William C. Lubenow, who posits that Hornby &quot;turfed out William Johnson and Oscar Browning because they were liberal reformers in a highly authoritarian institution ... [they] attempted to create a community where power and personality, desire and discipline, and love and learning were integrated. They committed the crime of Socrates: they corrupted youth by creating a world of multiple loyalties.&quot;

Giovanni Costigan wrote in 1972, &quot;In the century that has passed since then, no further light, incredible as it may seem, has been shed upon the subject [of Johnson&#x27;s dismissal] ... It may finally be remarked that in every reference yet made to this curious episode there seems never to have been a mention of the word &#x27;homosexuality&#x27;.&quot;

Johnson retired to Halsdon and changed his name on 17 October 1872 to Cory (the maiden name of his paternal grandmother) before emigrating for health reasons to Madeira in February 1878, where he married and had a son. He returned to England in September 1882, settling in Hampstead, where he died on 11 June 1892. He was buried at Hampstead on 16 June.

=== Posthumous influence ===
Cory is noted for a letter in which he articulates the purpose of education. His words are taken by many as a justification for studying Latin. The full quotation goes:

At school you are engaged not so much in acquiring knowledge as in making mental efforts under criticism. A certain amount of knowledge you can indeed with average faculties acquire so as to retain; nor need you regret the hours you spent on much that is forgotten, for the shadow of lost knowledge at least protects you from many illusions. But you go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment&#x27;s notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person&#x27;s thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage, and for mental soberness.

In 1924 an entire book devoted to Cory was printed, entitled &quot;Ionicus&quot;. The author was Reginald Baliol Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, to whom Johnson had grown close when Brett was a schoolboy. By then Brett was an adviser to the government and one of the most eminent and powerful men of his time. He had begun a correspondence with Cory while he was at Eton and continued it until the time of Cory&#x27;s death. The dedication mentions three Prime Ministers, two of whom (Rosebery and Balfour) learnt at Eton &quot;the elements of high politics from IONICUS&quot; (Rosebery and Balfour), whereas the third (Asquith) &quot;showed him kindness in his old age&quot;.

<text>Louisa Stuart Costello (9 October 1799 – 24 April 1870) was an Anglo-Irish author on travel and French history, said to have been born either in Ireland or Sussex.

==Life and work==
Costello lived in Paris, France, near the River Seine (according to her death certificate). She had no true home, but went from place to place staying with friends and acquaintances. She and her brother Dudley Costello, also well known for travel writing, promoted the copying of illuminated manuscripts. By the age of 15 she had become a proficient artist and later her earnings from miniature painting were enough to support her mother and to keep her brother while he attended Sandhurst.

She wrote over 100 texts, articles, poems and songs, and knew such people as Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Lord Byron, Thomas Moore. She was also a historian, painter and novelist. Her father, Colonel James Francis Costello, died in April 1814 while fighting against Napoleon.

Among Costello&#x27;s published works is her self-illustrated &quot;Memoirs of Eminent Englishwomen&quot; (1844), and several popular works of poetry and travel. Her collection &quot;Songs of a Stranger&quot; was dedicated to William Lisle Bowles. She returned to France only after her mother sent for her in 1815 or 1818, and then lived chiefly in Paris as a miniature-painter.

&quot;The Maid of the Cyprus Isle&quot; (1815) was among many books of travel, which were very popular, as were her novels, which drew chiefly on French history. Another work is &quot;Specimens of the Early Poetry of France&quot; (1835). Her book &quot;The Rose Garden of Persia&quot; (1887) contains versions of poems or poem extracts taken from Persian, illustrated with imitations of Persian illuminations. There were reissues in 1888, 1899 and 1913.

She died in Boulogne sur Mer, France, of mouth cancer.

<text>Anne Ross Cousin (née Cundell; 27 April 1824 – 6 December 1906) was a British poet, musician and songwriter. She was a student of John Muir Wood and later became a popular writer of hymns, most especially &quot;The Sands of Time Are Sinking&quot;, while travelling with her minister husband from 1854 to 1878. Many of her hymns were widely used throughout Great Britain during the mid-to late 19th century. One of her sons, John William Cousin, was a prominent writer and editor of &quot;A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature&quot;.

==Biography==
Anne Ross Cousin was born in Hull, England on 27 April 1824. She was the only child of Dr. David Ross Cundell, a former assistant surgeon with the 33rd regiment at the Battle of Waterloo, and moved with her family to Leith soon after her birth. She received a private education and became a skilled pianist under John Muir Wood. In 1847, she married William Cousin, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, then serving at a local Presbyterian church in Chelsea, and with whom she had six children. Shortly after their marriage, William was called to minister to the Free Church in Irvine, North Ayrshire, and then in Melrose in 1859. During this time, Anne began writing church hymns for her husband&#x27;s services and many of these became very popular in Britain during the mid-to late 19th century.

Her most popular song, &quot;The Sands of Time Are Sinking&quot;, was written in 1854 while William was still in Irvine. Cousin later claimed she had been inspired by the writing of Samuel Rutherford. The original version was 19 stanzas and first appeared in &quot;The Christian Treasury&quot; as &quot;The Last Words of Samuel Rutherford&quot; in 1857. It did not become widely known, however, until the Rev. Dr. J. Hood Wilson introduced a shorted 5-verse version into a hymn book, &quot;The Service of Praise&quot;, for his congregation at the Barclay Church in Edinburgh. Other popular ones included &quot;O Christ what burdens bowed Thy head&quot; and &quot;King Eternal King Immortal&quot;, the latter often set to music and sung at choral festivals. A collection of her poems, &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s Land and Other Pieces&quot;, was published in 1876 under her initials A.R.C., by which she was most widely known.

They retired in Edinburgh after nearly 20 years of religious service. William Cousin died in 1883, and Anne remained in the city until her own death on 6 December 1906. Her daughter, Anne P. Cousin, contributed to her biography when she was profiled for the Dictionary of National Biography by Sir Sidney Lee in 1912.

==The Sands of Time are Sinking==
Cousin&#x27;s best known hymn, &quot;The Sands of Time are Sinking&quot;, is known and sung over the English-speaking world. It is also known as &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s Land&quot;, the phrase that is repeated at the end of each stanza. This poem was inspired by Samuel Rutherford&#x27;s last words. It was first published in the 1860s, with extracts from Rutherford&#x27;s works, under the title: &quot;Last words of Reverend Samuel Rutherford: with some of his sweet sayings&quot;.

The first verse of &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s Land&quot; says:
:The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of Heaven breaks;
:The summer morn I’ve sighed for – the fair, sweet morn awakes:
:Dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring is at hand,
:And glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.
In this context, Immanuel is used as a name of Christ. The original poem has nineteen verses, but only a few of them appear in most hymnals. Many of the omitted verses are about Anwoth, where Rutherford lived.

<text>In astrodynamics, an orbiting body is any physical body that orbits a more massive one, called the primary body. The orbiting body is properly referred to as the secondary body (formula_1), which is less massive than the primary body (formula_2).

Thus, formula_3 or formula_4.

Under standard assumptions in astrodynamics, the barycenter of the two bodies is a focus of both orbits.

An orbiting body may be a spacecraft (i.e. an artificial satellite) or a natural satellite, such as a planet, dwarf planet, moon, moonlet, asteroid, or comet.

A system of two orbiting bodies is modeled by the Two-Body Problem and a system of three orbiting bodies is modeled by the Three-Body Problem. These problems can be generalized to an N-body problem. While there are a few analytical solutions to the n-body problem, it can be reduced to a 2-body system if the secondary body stays out of other bodies&#x27; Sphere of Influence and remains in the primary body&#x27;s sphere of influence.

<text>Dieren () is a town in the eastern Netherlands. It is located in Rheden, Gelderland, between Zutphen and Arnhem, on the bank of the IJssel.

Dieren was a separate municipality until 1818, when it became a part of Rheden.

The Gazelle bicycle factory is located in Dieren.

==History==

&quot;Hof te Dieren&quot; was the house of the Dutch Stadtholder Frederik Hendrik of Orange, William II, Prince of Orange, William III of Orange and William IV of Orange. They enlarged the house and held hunting parties in the nearby woods. A road was built, connecting Dieren to The Hague, which is called the &quot;Koningsweg&quot;. The road can still be found in many places in the Netherlands, such as Otterlo. The house was heavily damaged by Canadian soldiers during the liberation of the Netherlands, as they were under the wrong impression that German SS soldiers were located in the house. They were actually located in &quot;Avegoor&quot;, a building located to the south-west of Dieren.

==Economy==

===Manufacturing===

The Gazelle (bicycle) factory is located in Dieren and employs 550. It produces 300,000 bicycles a year, with a total production of over 13 million.

Dieren is also home to the Lonka Dieren confectionery manufacturer (formerly known as Chocolade-en Suikerwerkenfabriek Donkers BV). Lonka Dieren is the leading manufacturer of pectin-based confectionery covered in chocolate in the Netherlands. Lonka Dieren has been in business over 75 years, and moved from Amsterdam in 1955 due to lack of space.

===Tourism===

Dieren is located on the edge of the Veluwezoom National Park. With over 12,000 acres, this nature reserve offers trails for hiking, bicycling or horseriding. There is also a mountain bike route. One feature of the park is the Carolina Hill with trails going out like spokes of a wheel in 14 directions. Wildlife includes deer and wild boar. The park is accessible via rail to the Dieren station and local bus to the entrance. There are also some parking lots at the entrance to the park.

Dieren is also at the start of the Apeldoorn Canal. Originally built for transportation, this canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft like waterbikes and canoes, on the southern end on the east side there is also bike trails.

The Uitvinderij in Dieren is a popular destination for school trips. It is a theme park where children play and discover. There is also an area where they can create works of art or mechanical objects.

The Veluwe Steam Railway run by the Veluwsche Stoomtrein Maatschappij (VSM). This steam train connects Dieren with Apeldoorn, running through Eerbeek and Beekbergen.

Dieren has a number of hotels and bed and breakfasts.

<doc id="996843" wikidata="Q3312506" url="?curid=996843" title="Spinto">
<text>Spinto (Italian for &quot;pushed&quot;) is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms &#x27; or&#x27; are used to denote this category of voice.)

The spinto voice type is recognisable by its tonal &quot;slice&quot; or &quot;squillo&quot;. This enables the singer to cut through the wall of sound produced by a full Romantic orchestra in a wide variety of roles, excluding only the most taxing ones written by the likes of Richard Wagner (such as &quot;Brünhilde&quot;, &quot;Isolde&quot;, &quot;Tristan&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot;), Giacomo Meyerbeer (&quot;John of Leyden&quot;), Verdi (&quot;Otello&quot;), Puccini (&quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Calaf&quot;) and Richard Strauss (&quot;Elektra&quot;).

* : A fundamentally lyric soprano with a fair amount of extra &quot;pulp&quot; in her tone and a distinct thrust in her vocal attack. As they possess both a lyric and a dramatic quality, spinto sopranos are suitable for a broad spectrum of roles, ranging from genuine lyric parts such as Micaela in &quot;Carmen&quot; and Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; through to histrionically demanding Verdi heroines such as Leonora (in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;) and Aida, not to mention Puccini&#x27;s Madama Butterfly and Tosca. Lighter Wagnerian roles such as Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; or Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; also fall within their domain. Elisabeth Rethberg is a famous example of a soprano who sang exactly this kind of mixed Italian and German repertoire.
* : The tenor equivalent of the above. He can convincingly sing roles as lyrical as Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot;, the Duke in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot;, yet still excel in parts as heavy as Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;, Don Jose in &quot;Carmen&quot; and Radames in &quot;Aïda&quot;. Canio, in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; are other well-known examples of spinto tenor roles.

<doc id="996844" wikidata="Q1497276" url="?curid=996844" title="Labor induction">
<text>Labor induction is the procedure where a medical professional starts the process of labor (giving birth) instead of letting it start on its own. Labor may be induced (started) if the health of the mother or the baby is at risk. Induction of labor can be accomplished with pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical methods.

In Western countries, it is estimated that one-quarter of pregnant women have their labor medically induced with drug treatment. Inductions are most often performed either with prostaglandin drug treatment alone, or with a combination of prostaglandin and intravenous oxytocin treatment.

==Causes==

Commonly accepted medical reasons for induction include:
* Postterm pregnancy, i.e. if the pregnancy has gone past the end of the 42nd week.
* Intrauterine fetal growth restriction.
* There are health risks to the woman in continuing the pregnancy (e.g. pre-eclampsia).
* Premature rupture of the membranes); this is when the membranes have ruptured, but labor does not start within a specific amount of time.
* Premature termination of the pregnancy (abortion).
* Fetal death in utero and previous history of stillbirth.
* Twin pregnancy continuing beyond 38 weeks.
* Previous health conditions that puts risk on the woman and/or her child such as diabetes, high blood pressure.
* High body mass index.
* Macrosomia.

Induction of labor in those who are either at or after term improves outcomes for newborns and decreases the number of C-sections performed.

== Methods ==
Methods of inducing labor include both pharmacological medication and mechanical or physical approaches.

Mechanical and physical approaches can include artificial rupture of membranes or membrane sweeping. Membrane sweeping may lead to more women spontaneously going into labor (and fewer women having labor induction) but it may make little difference to the risk of maternal or neonatal death, or to the number of women having c-sections or spontaneous vaginal births. There are also risks associated with membrane sweeping. The risks include irregular contractions, bleeding, and in 1 out of every 10 women an amniotic sac rupture, which can lead to a formal induction within 24 hours of the rupture if labor hasn&#x27;t been induced.

The use of intrauterine catheters are also indicated. These work by compressing the cervix mechanically to generate release on prostaglandins in local tissues. There is no direct effect on the uterus. Results from a 2021 systematic review found no differences in cesarean delivery nor neonatal outcomes in women with low-risk pregnancies between inpatient nor outpatient cervical ripening.

===Medication===
* Intravaginal, endocervical or extra-amniotic administration of prostaglandin, such as dinoprostone or misoprostol. Prostaglandin E2 is the most studied compound and with most evidence behind it. A range of different dosage forms are available with a variety of routes possible. The use of misoprostol has been extensively studied but normally in small, poorly defined studies. Only a very few countries have approved misoprostol for use in induction of labor.
* Intravenous (IV) administration of synthetic oxytocin preparations is used to artificially induce labor if it is deemed medically necessary. A high dose of oxytocin does not seem to have greater benefits than a standard dose. There are risks associated with IV oxytocin induced labor. Risks include the women having induced contractions that are too vigorous, too close together (frequent), or that last too long, which may lead to added stress on the baby (changes in baby&#x27;s heart rate) and may require the mother to have an emergency caesarean section. There is no high quality evidence to indicate if IV oxytocin should be stopped once a woman reaches active labor in order to reduce the incidence of women requiring caesarean sections.
* Use of mifepristone has been described but is rarely used in practice.
* Relaxin has been investigated, but is not currently commonly used.
* mnemonic; ARNOP: Antiprogesterone, relaxin, nitric oxide donors, oxytocin, prostaglandins

===Non-pharmaceutical===
* Membrane sweep, also known as membrane stripping, Hamilton maneuver, or &quot;stretch and sweep&quot;. The procedure is carried out by a midwife or doctor as part of an internal vaginal examination. The midwife or doctor inserts lubricated, gloved fingers into the vagina and inserts their index finger into the opening of the cervix or neck of the womb. They then use a circular movement to try to separate the membranes of the amniotic sac, containing the baby, from the cervix. This action, which releases hormones called prostaglandins, may prepare the cervix for birth and may initiate labour. While this process can cause discomfort, bleeding, and irregular contractions and carries the risk of breaking the amniotic sack, many would still choose to have membrane sweeping carried out for their next birth. 
* Artificial rupture of the membranes (AROM or ARM) (&quot;breaking the waters&quot;)
* Extra-amniotic saline infusion (EASI), in which a Foley catheter is inserted into the cervix and the distal portion expanded to dilate it and to release prostaglandins.
* Cook Medical Double Balloon known as the Cervical Ripening Balloon with Stylet for assisted placement is approved by the FDA in the United States. The Double balloon provides one balloon to be inflated with saline on one side of the uterine side of the cervix and the second balloon to be inflated with saline on the vaginal side of the cervix.

== Timing and risks ==

Labor induction before 39 weeks of pregnancy is not recommended unless there the mother or her child would be at risk otherwise. Some medical guidelines recommend waiting until 41 weeks with low-risk pregnancies before induction. Doctors and pregnant women should have a discussion of risks and benefits when considering an induction of labor in the absence of an accepted medical indication.

Inducing labor before 39 weeks in the absence of a medical indication (such as hypertension, intrauterine growth restriction, or pre-eclampsia) increases the risk of complications of prematurity including difficulties with respiration, infection, feeding, jaundice, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and perinatal death. Inducing labor after 34 weeks and before 37 weeks in women with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, gestational hypertension) may lead to better outcomes for the woman but does not improve or worsen outcomes for the baby. 

Postterm pregnancies lasting beyond 41-42 weeks are associated with increased risks of stillbirth, neonatal death and caesarean section which can be reduced by inducing labor.

If waters break (membranes rupture) between 24 and 37 weeks&#x27; gestation, waiting for the labor to start naturally with careful monitoring of the woman and baby is more likely to lead to healthier outcomes. For women over 37 weeks pregnant whose babies are suspected of not coping well in the womb, it is not yet clear from research whether it is best to have an induction or caesarean immediately, or to wait until labour happens by itself. Similarly, there is not yet enough research to show whether it is best to deliver babies prematurely if they are not coping in the womb or whether to wait so that they are less premature when they are born.

Sometimes when a woman&#x27;s waters break after 37 weeks she is induced instead of waiting for labour to start naturally. This may decrease the risks of infection for the woman and baby but more research is needed to find out whether inducing is good for women and babies longer term.

Women who have had a caesarean section for a previous pregnancy are at risk of having a uterine rupture, when their caesarean scar re-opens. Uterine rupture is a serious threat for the woman and the baby, and induction of labour increases this risk further. There is not yet enough research to determine which method of induction is safest for a woman who has had a caesarean section before. There is also no research to say whether it is better for these women and their babies to have an elective caesarean section instead of being induced.

There is insufficient scientific evidence to determine if inducing a woman&#x27;s labor at home is a safe and effective approach for both the women and the baby.

=== Predicting the necessity of induction ===
Clinicians assess the odds of having a vaginal delivery after labor induction by a &quot;Bishop score&quot;. However, recent research has questioned the relationship between the Bishop score and a successful induction, finding that a poor Bishop score actually may improve the chance for a vaginal delivery after induction. A Bishop Score is done to assess the progression of the cervix prior to an induction. In order to do this, the cervix must be checked to see how much it has effaced, thinned out, and how far dilated it is. The score goes by a points system depending on five factors. Each factor is scored on a scale of either 0–2 or 0–3, any total score less than 5 holds a higher risk of delivering by caesarean section.

== Women&#x27;s experiences ==
Women often do not receive clear and detailed information about the process of labor induction, its benefits and risks. For example women might not know how long the process will last, how long they need to stay in the hospital and how strong the pain caused by the procedure would be. Providing up-to-date information about the procedure allows women to make an informed choice and give an informed consent or refuse the induction.

Many women reported feeling that they were not involved in making the decision whether to induce labor and that this decision is made for them instead. Others reported feeling forgotten or alone in relation to the procedure, not being listened to and the severity of their pain being questioned. Some reported feeling they did not have a choice other then vaginal delivery but others reported being able to choose the date of induction and the method of giving birth.

Even though women reported seeing hospitals as a safe place for labor induction and giving birth, for some it is also considered an anxiety-inducing setting where they are restricted and not allowed to move around or see family members.

== Criticisms ==

Membrane sweeping, a common method of labor induction, can cause bleeding and irregular contractions and is often done without informed consent by the pregnant person.

The medical rationale for performing an induction is decreasing the risk of stillbirth. However, the probability of having a stillbirth post-term is very small, meaning that for the vast majority of post-term pregnancies, inductions are unnecessary. Approximately 500 inductions are performed in order to avoid 1 stillbirth. Many of these unnecessary inductions could potentially provoke other risks, forcing medical practitioners to perform other interventions such as caesarean sections. These additional interventions could cause labor to be more risky for the pregnant person.

Another criticism of inductions is that the pregnant person&#x27;s bodily autonomy is overlooked. Many pregnant people might not want to be induced, and rather share in the decision-making process with their medical practitioner.

Induced labor may be more painful for the woman as one of the side effects of intravenous oxytocin is increased contraction pains, mainly due to the rigid onset. This may lead to the increased use of analgesics and other pain-relieving pharmaceuticals. These interventions may also lead to an increased likelihood of caesarean section delivery for the baby. However after 41 weeks of gestation there is a reduction of cesarean deliveries when the labour is induced.

The Institute for Safe Medication Practices labeled pitocin a &quot;high-alert medication&quot; because of the high likelihood of &quot;significant patient harm when it is used in error.&quot;

<text>Eefde is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is located in the municipality of Lochem, about 3 km northeast of the city of Zutphen.

== Overview ==
It was first mentioned between 1294 and 1295 as Evede, and might relate to a sheep (English: ewe for female sheep). In 1840, it was home to 709 people. After World War II, it started to developed as a suburb of Zutphen.

There is a legend that Witte Wieven appear on that village every Christmas Eve, and dance on a Hill named &quot;Wittenwievenbult&quot; (Wise woman hill), after the white woman.

<text>Lobith is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is located in the municipality of Zevenaar. Traditionally, it is said that the Rhine enters the Netherlands at Lobith, although in reality, this happens about 4 km further upstream, near Spijk.

Lobith was a separate municipality for a short while between 1 March 1817 and 1 January 1818, when it became a part of Herwen en Aerdt.

== History ==
In 885, the Danish chief Godfrid was summoned to Lobith for a meeting after being accused of complicity with Hugh, Duke of Alsace in an insurrection against the emperor Charles the Fat. In an act of treachery he was killed by a group of German nobles.

The village was first mentioned in 1222 as Lobedhe. The etymology is unclear. The village developed along a bend in the Rhine. In 1307, a castle was built in Lobith. In 1473, it became part of the Duchy of Cleves. In 1609, the Duke of Cleves died without a successor, and the War of the Jülich Succession started which resulted in Lobith becoming a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The Dutch Reformed Church was built in 1660 as a replacement of a chapel which was destroyed in 1648. In 1672, the castle was destroyed by the French. 

Up to 1711, the Rhine was located close to the village, however the river changed course. The distance from the river resulted in Tolkamer becoming the centre of economic activity for the region. In 1816, Lobith became part of the Netherlands. In 1840, it was home to 682 people. The grist mill Tolhuys Coornmolen was built in 1888. In 1930, it burned down and only the base remained. The grinding was since then performed by an electric motor. In 1995, the wind mill was restored and operates once a week.

<doc id="996851" wikidata="Q2128886" url="?curid=996851" title="Hertsa Raion">
<text>Hertsa Raion or Hertza Raion (, translit.: &quot;Hertsaiivs&#x27;kyi raion&quot;; ) was an administrative raion (district) in the southern part of Chernivtsi Oblast in western Ukraine, on the Romanian border. The region had an area of and the administrative center in the city of Hertsa. It was one of the three raions of Ukraine with the majority of the ethnic Romanian population. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions in Chernivtsi Oblast to three. The area of Hertsa Raion was merged into Chernivtsi Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 

At the time of disestablishment, the raion consisted of two hromadas, Hertsa urban hromada with the administration in Hertsa and Ostrytsia rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Ostrytsia.

==History==
The Hertsa region was part of the Principality of Moldavia since its founding in the 14th century. After the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859, it became part of Romania (which gained its formal independence in 1877), as one of the five districts (&quot;plăși&quot;) of Dorohoi County.

The region was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, and was added to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was recaptured by Romania in 1941 in the course of the Axis attack on the Soviet Union in World War II, but it was recaptured again by the Soviet Army in 1944. The annexation was confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties in 1947 between the USSR and Romania.

The fact that neither the secret protocol (appendix) of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which specified the expansionist claims of both sides, nor the June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum demanding from the Kingdom of Romania the adjacent territory of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia included Hertsa makes the capture by the Soviets controversial in Romania. Furthermore, unlike Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the region had not been a part of Imperial Russia or Austria-Hungary before World War I, but had been a part of Romania and one of its predecessor states, Moldavia, before that.

In 1962, the raion was merged into Hlyboka Raion, and in 1991, it was reinstated again.

In 2003/2004, the raion had 10 Romanian middle schools, 7 incomplete meiddle schools and 11 elementary schools in Romanian, with 315 classes and 5,446 students, and a Ukrainian middle school and a Ukrainian elementary school, with 15 classes and 259 students.

==Demographics==
In 1930, the region had a population of 30,082, of which 27,919 (92.8%) Romanians, 1,931 (6.4%) were Jews, and 232 (0.8%) people of other ethnicities.

In 2001, the population of Hertsa Raion was 32,316, of which 29,554 or 91.45% identified themselves as Romanians, 1,616 or 5.0% as Ukrainians, and 756 or 2.34% as Moldovans (out of which 511 self-identified their language as Moldovan and 237 as Romanian), 0.9% as Russians, and 0.3% as being of other ethnicities (&quot;see: Ukrainian Census, 2001). Hertsa raion, within its boundaries at that time, had 32,316 inhabitants in 2001, including 4.83% Ukrainian-speakers, 93.82% Romanian-speakers, and 1.21% Russian-speakers. In the last Soviet census of 1989, out of 29,611 inhabitants, 1,569 declared themselves Ukrainians (5.30%), 23,539 Romanians (79.49%), 3,978 Moldovans (13.43%), and 431 Russians (1.46%). The decline in the number (from 3,978 to 756) and proportion of Moldovans (from 13.43% to 2.34%) was explained by a switch from a census Moldovan to a census Romanian ethnic identity, and has continued after the 2001 census. By contrast, the number of self-identified ethnic Romanians has increased (from 23,539 to 29,554), and so has their proportion of the population of the former raion (from 79.49% to 91.45%), and the process has continued after the 2001 census. Some authors have argued that most of the inhabitants of the former Hertsa Raion who had self-identified themselves as Moldovans in 1989 self-identified themselves as Romanians in 2001. Since the Hertsa raion split from the Hlyboka raion after the 1989 Soviet census, we do not have the breakdown of the inhabitants of Hertsa raion by native language in 1989. In 2001, this was Ukraine&#x27;s only raion in which an absolute majority of the population was recorded by the census as having a Romanian identity, and the raion in Ukraine with the largest proportion of Romanian-speakers.

According to the 2001 census, in the Hertsa urban hromada (urban community) created in 2020, with a population of 17,519, 572 of the inhabitants (3.27%) spoke Ukrainian as their native language, while 16,627 (94.91%) spoke Romanian, including 16,485 who called their language Romanian (94.1%) and 142 who called it Moldovan (0.81%) and 298 (1.7%) spoke Russian. In 2001, in the Ostrytsia rural hromada (rural community) created in 2020, with a population of 13,868, 960 of the inhabitants (6.92%) spoke Ukrainian as their native language, while 12,796 (92.27%) spoke Romanian (out of which 12,428 or 89.62% called the language Romanian and 371 or 2.68% called the language Moldovan), and 89 (0.64%) spoke Russian.

The raion included only three localities in which there were more self-identified Moldovans than Romanians in 1989, all of them historically a part of Bukovina; in two, the population identified its language overwhelmingly as Romanian in 2001 (see below). In the village of Ostrytsia in the Hertsa Raion, in 2001, 93.73% of the inhabitants spoke Romanian as their native language (93.22% self-declared Romanian and 0.52% self-declared Moldovan), while 4.96% spoke Ukrainian. In the Soviet census of 1989, the number of inhabitants of the locality who declared themselves Romanians plus Moldovans was 2,965 (324, or 10.05% Romanians plus 2,641 or 81.92% Moldovans) out of 3,224, representing 91.97% of the locality&#x27;s population, and there were 205 ethnic Ukrainians (6.36%). In 2001, 893, or 94.4% of the 946 inhabitants of the village of Tsuren of the Hertsa Raion spoke Romanian as their native language (630 self-declared it Romanian or 66.6%, and 263 declared in Moldovan, or 27.8%), with a minority of 50 Ukrainian speakers (5.29%). In the 1989 census, the number of residents who declared themselves Romanian plus Moldovan was 865, representing 96.11% of the locality&#x27;s population out of 900, including 108 self-identified Romanians (12%) and 757 self-identified Moldovans (84.11%), and there were 31 ethnic Ukrainians (3.44%). Another locality where a significant amount of identity change from Moldovan and Moldovan-speaking to Romanian and Romanian-speaking was Mamornytsia (see the Ukrainian language article on it at https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8F and the Romanian language one at https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamorni%C8%9Ba,_Her%C8%9Ba), though the self-identified Moldovan speakers (21 people) were more numerous than the self-identified Romanian speakers (20 people) by one person in 2001.

The number of self-declared ethnic Romanians plus Moldovans in the raion (30,310, or 93.79%) was slightly lower than the number of Romanian-speakers (30,337, or 93.88%); 99.65% of the Romanians plus Moldovans used Romanian as their native language, a figure comparable to that of the Romanian ethnic population in Transcarpathia. The number of ethnic Ukrainians in the raion increased from 1,569 to 1,616, but their percentage of the population decreased from 5.3% to 5%. The number of ethnic Ukrainians due to natural increase and because of the identity change of a number of previously self-identified ethnic Romanians or Russians to ethnic Ukrainians from among those who had attended Ukrainian schools. While 51 Romanians and 6 Moldovans declared that their native language was Ukrainian, 89 Ukrainians were speaking Romanian as their mother tongue in 2001.

<text>George Lillie Craik (1798–1866) was a Scottish writer and literary critic.

==Life==

Born at Kennoway, Fife, he was the eldest of three illustrious brothers to the local schoolmaster, his younger brothers including Henry Craik and James Craik.

He was educated at the University of St. Andrews, and went to London in 1824, where he wrote largely for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

In 1849 he was appointed Professor of English Literature and History at Belfast. Among his books are &quot;The New Zealanders&quot; (1830), &quot;The Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties&quot; (1831), &quot;History of British Commerce&quot; (1844), and &quot;History of English Literature and the English Language&quot; (1861). He was also joint author of &quot;The Pictorial History of England&quot;, and wrote books on Edmund Spenser and Francis Bacon. 

His &quot;Sketches of Popular Tumults: Illustrative of the Evils of Social Ignorance&quot; (1837) included an account of the Gordon Riots in which he wrote that many rioters &quot;drank themselves literally dead, and many more, who had rendered themselves unable to move, perished in the midst of flames&quot;, and may have influenced Charles Dickens&#x27; depiction of the riots in &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; (1841). Herman Melville drew inspiration for Queequeg in his novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; from a description in Craik&#x27;s book, &quot;The New Zealanders&quot; (1830), of Te Pēhi Kupe, a Māori chief of the Ngāti Toa iwi famous for his travels in England.

==Family==

His second daughter was the novelist Georgiana M. Craik.

<text>Angeren is a village in the municipality of Lingewaard, Gelderland province, Netherlands. It has a population of 2,851 (1 January 2009), and is located in the very eastern tip of the Betuwe, 2 km to the south of Huissen, between the cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen.

Angeren is first mentioned as &quot;Angrina&quot; in a document dated 814 or 815. By 1160 Angeren was an independent parish. During the Middle Ages, Angeren grew to a village with a village square, a fortification &quot;(&#x27;Het Roode Wald&#x27;)&quot; and a flour mill.

The symbol of Angeren is &quot;Het Keuje&quot; (&#x27;The Pig&#x27;) and there is a small statue of it in the centre of the town. The symbol refers to the historic dependency of Angeren on agriculture (mainly pig farms).

The local football club is S.V. Angeren. Their first squad plays in the 3rd division (Sunday amateurs – Eastern Region KNVB).
The local tennis club is called TV Angeren.

Angeren is located at the Linge, a small river that springs up in the nearby town of Doornenburg, and the Pannerdens Kanaal, a canal linking the Waal and the Nederrijn.

The freight train route Betuwelijn (opened in 2007) passes Angeren and crosses the Pannerdens Kanaal via a tunnel. Construction of the train route caused considerable protest in the village: on 4 April 2000 for example, a house that needed to be demolished was occupied by protesters who sat on the roof before being forced off by police. This event caused substantial media coverage.

<text>Doornenburg is a village to the south east of Angeren in the municipality of Lingewaard, Gelderland, the Netherlands. Doornenburg Castle is located near the village.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in the 9th century as Doronburc, and means fortified place and either thorns or the Doro (person)&quot;. Doornenburg developed on a ridge in the Early Middle Ages.

Doornenburg Castle started in the 14th century as a castle in front of a large square. During the 15th and 16th century, the square was aligned with buildings. The outer bailey was constructed in the 15th century and is the largest of the Netherlands. The castle and its buildings were restored between 1937 and 1941 and returned to their medieval form. In 1945, it was severely damaged and restored between 1947 and 1968.

In 1742, a fort was built on the Pannerdens Kanaal, however only fragments remain. In 1939, seven casemates were built near the fort.

Doornenburg was home to 629 people in 1840. The village was evacuated on 12 October 1944. The church tower was blown up by German soldiers on 27 December 1944 and the village remained in German hands until 2 April 1945.

The village was first mentioned between 1052 and 1056 as Pannardum. The etymology is unclear. The village developed along the Rhine. In 1284, it became part of the Duchy of Cleves. Between 1705 and 1707, the Pannerdens Kanaal to control the water flow between the Rhine and the Waal. 

In 1817, Pannerden became part of the Netherlands. In 1840, it was home to 507 people. In 1860, the postal authorities split the village in Pannerden (Oostzijde) and Pannerden (Westzijde) because it was cut in two by the canal. Since around 1970, it is once again a single village. The Catholic St.-Martinus Church was built between 1877 and 1878. The tower was destroyed in 1944 and not rebuilt.

<text>Robert Frederick Christy (May 14, 1916 – October 3, 2012) was a Canadian-American theoretical physicist and later astrophysicist who was one of the last surviving people to have worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He briefly served as acting president of California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

A graduate of the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the 1930s where he studied physics, he followed George Volkoff, who was a year ahead of him, to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was accepted as a graduate student by Robert Oppenheimer, the leading theoretical physicist in the United States at that time. Christy received his doctorate in 1941 and joined the physics department of Illinois Institute of Technology.

In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where he was recruited by Enrico Fermi to join the effort to build the first nuclear reactor, having been recommended as a theory resource by Oppenheimer. When Oppenheimer formed the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, Christy was one of the early recruits to join the Theory Group. Christy is generally credited with the insight that a solid sub-critical mass of plutonium could be explosively compressed into supercriticality, a great simplification of earlier concepts of implosion requiring hollow shells. For this insight the solid-core plutonium model is often referred to as the &quot;Christy pit&quot;.

After the war, Christy briefly joined the University of Chicago Physics department before being recruited to join the Caltech faculty in 1946 when Oppenheimer decided it was not practical for him to resume his academic activities. He stayed at Caltech for his academic career, serving as Department Chair, Provost and Acting President. In 1960 Christy turned his attention to astrophysics, creating some of the first practical computation models of stellar oscillations. For this work Christy was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1967. In the 1980s and 1990s Christy participated in the National Research Council&#x27;s Committee on Dosimetry, an extended effort to better understand the actual radiation exposure due to the bombs dropped on Japan, and on the basis of that learning, better understand the medical risks of radiation exposure.

==Early life==
Robert Frederick Cohen was born on May 14, 1916, in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of Moise Jacques Cohen, an electrical engineer, and his wife Hattie Alberta née Mackay, a school teacher. He was named Robert after his maternal great uncle Robert Wood, and Frederick after Frederick Alexander Christy, the second husband of his maternal grandmother. He had an older brother, John, who was born in 1913. Moise changed the family surname to Christy by deed poll on August 31, 1918. On November 4, Moise was accidentally electrocuted at work. Hattie died after goitre surgery in 1926. Christy and his brother were then cared for by Robert Wood, their grandmother Alberta Mackay, and their great aunt Maud Mackay.

Christy was educated at Magee High School, and graduated in 1932 with the highest examination score in the province of British Columbia. He was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Academic Medal, and, importantly in view of his family&#x27;s limited ability to pay, free tuition to attend the University of British Columbia (UBC). At the award dinner he met the second-place winner, Dagmar Elizabeth von Lieven, whom he dated while at UBC. He received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in mathematics and physics with first class honors in 1935, and his Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1937, writing a thesis on &quot;Electron attachment and negative ion formation in oxygen&quot;.

George Volkoff, a friend of Christy who was a year ahead of him at UBC, was accepted as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, by Robert Oppenheimer, who led the most active school of theoretical physics in the United States at that time. This inspired Christy to apply to the University of California as well. He was accepted, and was awarded a fellowship for his first year. At Berkeley he shared an apartment with Volkoff, Robert Cornog, Ken McKenzie and McKenzie&#x27;s wife Lynn McKenzie. For his thesis, Oppenheimer had him look at mesotrons, subatomic particles called muons today, that had recently been found in cosmic rays. They were so-called because they were more massive than electrons but less massive than protons. With the help of Shuichi Kusaka he performed detailed calculations of the particle&#x27;s spin. He published two papers on mesotrons with Kusaka in the Physical Review, which formed the basis of his 1941 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis 

==Manhattan Project==
Christy could have graduated in 1940, but could not then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This brought him to the attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him but as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.
Enrico Fermi and his team from Columbia University arrived at the University of Chicago in January 1942 as part of an effort to concentrate the Manhattan Project&#x27;s reactor work at the new Metallurgical Laboratory. Fermi arranged with Wigner for Christy to join his group, which was building a nuclear reactor, which Fermi called a &quot;pile&quot;, in the squash court under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. Construction began on November 6, 1942, and Christy was present when Chicago Pile-1 went critical on December 2.

In early 1943, Christy joined Oppenheimer&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he became an American citizen in 1943 or 1944. Hans Bethe, the head of T (Theoretical) Division, detailed his physicists to assist with the projects at the laboratory. With his knowledge of reactors, Christy&#x27;s assignment was to help Donald W. Kerst&#x27;s Water Boiler group. The Water Boiler was an aqueous homogeneous reactor intended as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. It was the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel, and the first to use liquid fuel in the form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water. Christy estimated that it would require of pure uranium-235, a figure he subsequently revised to . When the reactor went critical on May 9, 1944, with , the accuracy of Christy&#x27;s figures raised the laboratory&#x27;s confidence in T Division&#x27;s calculations.

The discovery by Emilio Segrè&#x27;s group in April and May 1944 of high levels of plutonium-240 in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, but studies indicated that this would be extremely difficult to achieve. By August 1944, the calculations had been made of how an ideal spherical implosion would work; the problem was how to make it work in the real world where jets and spalling were a problem. Christy worked in Rudolf Peierls&#x27;s T-1 Group, which studied the theory of implosion. He suggested the possibility of using a solid plutonium core that would form a critical mass when compressed. This was an ultra-conservative design that solved the problem of jets by brute force. It became known as the &quot;Christy pit&quot; or &quot;Christy gadget&quot;, &quot;gadget&quot; being the laboratory euphemism for a bomb. However the solid pit was intrinsically less efficient than a hollow pit, and it required a modulated neutron initiator to start the chain reaction. Christy worked with Klaus Fuchs, Paul Stein and Hans Bethe to develop a suitable initiator design, which became known as an &quot;urchin&quot;. The Gadget used in the Trinity nuclear test and the Fat Man used in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki used Christy pits.

Later in life, Christy agreed to give a number of both oral history and video interviews in which he discussed his role in the Manhattan Project and latter interests.

==Later life==

After the war ended, Christy accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at a salary of $5,000 per annum, twice what he had been making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing was hard to find in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family.

Before the war, Oppenheimer had spent part of each year teaching at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Christy was one of Oppenheimer&#x27;s Berkeley students who made the trip down to Pasadena, California, each year to continue studying with Oppenheimer. After the war, Oppenheimer decided that with his additional responsibilities he could no longer continue this arrangement. The head of the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech, Charles Lauritsen therefore asked Oppenheimer for the name of a theoretical physicist that he would recommend as a replacement. Oppenheimer recommended Christy. Willy Fowler then approached Christy with an offer of a full-time position at Caltech at $5,400 per annum, and Christy accepted. He remained at Caltech for the rest of his academic career. The drawback to working at Caltech was that neither Lauritsen nor Fowler was a theoretical physicist, so a heavy workload fell on Christy. This was recognised by a pay raise to $10,000 per annum in 1954.

Christy joined Oppenheimer, Lauritsen and Robert Bacher, who joined the faculty at Caltech in 1949, in Project Vista, a detailed 1951 study on how Western Europe could be defended against the Soviet Union. Christy was distraught at the outcome of the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing. When he encountered Teller, who had testified against Oppenheimer, at Los Alamos in 1954, Christy publicly refused to shake Teller&#x27;s hand. &quot;I viewed Oppenheimer as a god&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;and I was sure that he was not a treasonable person.&quot; Asked about his relationship with Teller in 2006, Christy said:

In 1956, Christy was one of a number of scientists from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.
During a sabbatical year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an investigation of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At the time it was a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society&#x27;s Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.

Christy was appointed vice president and Provost of Caltech in 1970. Under Christy and President Harold Brown Caltech expanded its humanities and added economics to allow (or perhaps to compel—undergrads were required to take 25% of their units in &quot;humanities&quot;) students to broaden their education. He had David Morrisroe appointed as vice president for Financial Affairs, and they steered Caltech through the financially stringent 1970s. The first women were admitted as undergraduates in Fall 1970.

When Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974, filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Christy pressed for the case to be settled and La Belle to be given tenure. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle received tenure in 1979.

In 1970 he became romantically involved with Inge-Juliana Sackman, a fellow physicist 26 years his junior. He divorced Dagmar in early 1971, and married Juliana on August 4, 1973. They had two daughters, Illia Juliana Lilly Christy, born in 1974, and Alexandra Roberta (Alexa) Christy, born in 1976.

Christy briefly became acting President of Caltech in 1977 when Brown left to become Secretary of Defense. Christy returned to teaching after Marvin L. Goldberger became president in 1978. He became Institute Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1983, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986.

Christy died on October 3, 2012. He was survived by his wife Juliana, their two daughters, Illia and Alexa, and his two sons, Peter and Ted. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California.

<text>Watermark is the second studio album by Irish singer, songwriter and musician Enya, released on 19 September 1988 by WEA. After the release of her previous album &quot;Enya&quot; (1987), she secured a recording contract with Warner following a chance meeting with chairman Rob Dickins, who had become a fan of her music. Her contract allowed her considerable artistic and creative freedom, with minimal interference from the label and no deadlines. Enya recorded &quot;Watermark&quot; in ten months with her long-time collaborators: manager, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was initially recorded in Ireland in demo form before production relocated to London to re-record, mix, and master it digitally. &quot;Watermark&quot; features music in different styles, displaying Enya&#x27;s sound of multi-tracked vocals with keyboards, percussion instruments, and elements of Celtic, ambient, and new-age music, though Enya believes her music does not belong in the latter genre.

&quot;Watermark&quot; received positive reviews from critics and it became an unexpected commercial success, which propelled Enya to worldwide fame. It peaked at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and reached number 1 in New Zealand and Switzerland. It was certified quadruple Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1.2 million and 4 million copies across the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. To promote the album, Enya embarked on a worldwide promotional tour which included interviews, appearances, and live performances. Four singles were released from the album, beginning with the international hit &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, which spent three weeks at number 1 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Watermark&quot; was reissued in 1989, 1991 and 2009; the first two contain &quot;Storms in Africa (Part II)&quot; as a bonus track; the latter was a Japanese release with a second bonus track titled &quot;Morning Glory&quot;.

== Background ==
In March 1987, the 25-year-old Enya released her self-titled debut solo album &quot;Enya&quot; on BBC Records in the United Kingdom and on Atlantic Records in the United States. It was originally produced as the soundtrack to the BBC2 documentary series &quot;The Celts&quot;, with Enya and her recording partners of five years, manager, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was a mild commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the United Kingdom. Soon after its release Rob Dickins, then chairman of Warner Music UK, became a fan of the album, playing it &quot;every night before I went to bed&quot;. Weeks later, he met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the year&#x27;s Irish Recorded Music Association Awards in Dublin where Dickins learned Enya was considering signing with a rival label, prompting him to attract her to Warner. After a period of negotiations, Dickins signed Enya, granting her wish for complete artistic freedom without interference from management or deadlines to have albums finished. Dickins later said, &quot;Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music.&quot; In the process, Enya departed from Atlantic and signed to the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle distribution in North America.

== Recording==

With the green-light to make a new album, Enya recorded &quot;Watermark&quot; from June 1987 to April 1988. It was initially recorded in demo form at Aigle Studio, a 16-track facility located in the basement of the Ryans&#x27; home, then located in Artane, a northern suburb of Dublin. Nicky operated a Fostex E16 tape machine with KEF and Yamaha NS-10M speakers for monitoring, two Alesis MIDIverb II models, an ATC Q1 for reverb, and a Roland SDE-1000 Digital Delay for delay. He made a conscious effort not to incorporate audio compression as he wished to make the music sound satisfactory &quot;at the recording end&quot;. Enya wrote and recorded the album without the use of a click track to retain a more natural feel to the music. Enya played a variety of keyboards and synthesisers, including the Yamaha KX88 master keyboard, Yamaha TX802, Oberheim Matrix-6R, Akai S900, Roland D-50, Roland Juno-60 and PPG Wave. The Juno-60 was a particular favourite of hers. Prior to recording the album, she had intended to replace its parts with better sounds but could not find better substitutes, so they were left in.

After a demo version of the album was put down, Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya&#x27;s multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found the digital recording had lost &quot;warmth in the bottom end&quot;. Recording took place at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London and lasted for two months with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. &quot;Storms in Africa&quot; and &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; were completed on the studio&#x27;s two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the &quot;intimate and personal&quot; setting of their home studio, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Nicky said the studio was designed &quot;in a completely mad way&quot;, which he and Enya found more attractive to work in. During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step, which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, &quot;taking these heavy pain-killers, sitting at the desk, in the studio with one foot propped up on cushions.&quot; Cullum completed the majority of the album&#x27;s mixing at Wessex Sound Studios; Jim Barton was the mixer on &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;.

&quot;Watermark&quot; firmly established Enya&#x27;s sound of multi-layered vocals, keyboard-oriented songs, and influences of Celtic music. Enya felt the need to have layers of vocals to add a &quot;human element&quot; to her music as solely using keyboards and digital sampling sounded, to her, &quot;a bit linear and straight&quot;. The idea of the multi-vocals originated when Enya was a member of Clannad, her family&#x27;s Celtic band, in the early 1980s. With Nicky as their manager, influenced by The Beach Boys and the &quot;wall of sound&quot; technique made famous by producer Phil Spector, the two often discussed the idea of layering Enya&#x27;s voice to make it its own instrument. After experimenting with the concept on &quot;Enya&quot; the vocals became more established on &quot;Watermark&quot;, with as many as over 200 vocal tracks were painstakingly recorded for certain sections. In one instance, around 90 tracks had been put down during a period of several days but the two felt they did not sound right, so they erased them and started over. This was the case particularly during the recording of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot;, a piano instrumental, when they experimented with the idea of adding vocals but decided against keeping them.

== Songs ==

&quot;Watermark&quot; is formed of eleven tracks, eight of which Enya and Roma are listed on as co-writers. The remaining three are instrumentals solely composed by Enya. She had performed solos as a vocal on &quot;Enya&quot;, but wanted them played by different instruments on &quot;Watermark&quot;, and employed additional musicians to play parts that were already written: Neil Buckley plays the clarinet on &quot;On Your Shore&quot;, Chris Hughes plays the rototoms on &quot;River&quot; and the rototoms and African hand drum on &quot;Storms in Africa&quot;, and Davy Spillane contributes the low whistle and uilleann pipes on &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Na Laetha Geal M&#x27;óige&quot;. Enya sings in Irish, her first language, and English and Latin. She looked back on the album in 2000: &quot;Looking back ... the words are those of loss, of reflection, of exile – not necessarily from one&#x27;s country, but from those whom the heart loves. It has in its theme searching, longing, of reaching out for an answer. The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey.&quot;

===Side one===
&quot;Watermark&quot; opens with a same-titled track, a tradition that Enya would adopt on her next three albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing at the time of recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed for the first time in the liner notes for Enya&#x27;s 2002 box set, &quot;Only Time – The Collection&quot;. Enya and Nicky dedicated the track to Bones Howe, an American producer and a friend of Nicky&#x27;s who was the inspiration behind the only word that Enya sings on the track: &quot;Howe&quot;. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that &quot;Watermark&quot; was a favourite of hers.
&quot;Cursum Perficio&quot; came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles on her front doorstep. It means &quot;Your journey ends here&quot; in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be &quot;bold and up-front&quot; like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Irish would not complement the music, so Latin was used. Its original title was &quot;Quo Plus&quot;.

&quot;On Your Shore&quot; refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya&#x27;s hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, &quot;When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on and everybody was wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, where we would start to talk about them and a song would evolve.&quot; It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous &quot;vocal experiments&quot; were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, so it took the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument that suited the vocals she used when singing it.

&quot;Storms in Africa&quot; originated from a melody that Enya had played on the Juno-60 after Nicky had preset with a sound using its arpeggiator function and asked her to develop something with it. He returned to the studio several hours later to find Enya had come up with the song&#x27;s chord sequence, which inspired him to suggest the title. From then on, he helped to &quot;guide its direction&quot; and arrangement. They wanted the song to capture a feeling of unrest, to which Cullum suggested they bring in Hughes to play the rototoms and African hand drums. The track was named after it was recorded. Two versions were recorded with Irish and English lyrics; Roma recalled the Irish version became the favourite to which Enya and Nicky also agreed, which led to its addition on the album. The English version, titled &quot;Storms in Africa (Part II)&quot;, became a B-side on the former&#x27;s single in 1989 and a bonus track on some later pressings of &quot;Watermark&quot;.

In writing about &quot;Exile&quot; in 2002, Roma believed its theme of loneliness from the separation of one&#x27;s love is also met with &quot;hope and determination&quot; that they will return. The song was originally recorded with wordless vocals, but Dickins thought it would work better with lyrics, in particular poetry by Wilfred Owen. Roma was familiar with some of Owen&#x27;s works, and wrote a set of lyrics inspired by their style. Enya and Nicky wished to incorporate the shakuhachi, a Japanese flute, on the track but they could not find a player confident enough. Instead, as Nicky explained, they resorted to hiring &quot;a gypsy guy to play the flute&quot;. The vocal version was released as a B-side to Enya&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Book of Days&quot;, titled &quot;As Baile&quot;.

&quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; is a reworked version of a same-titled piano instrumental that Enya originally recorded in 1983, her first project as a solo artist. It was released on &quot;Touch Travel&quot; (1984), an audio cassette of music from various artists. When the track was re-recorded for &quot;Watermark&quot;, Enya and Nicky toyed with adding vocals and other instruments, but agreed it sounded best as a piano piece. Its title refers to the same-titled book by English novelist Miss Read, whose depictions of country and village life, and the people who lived there, appealed to Enya. Roma thought the piece &quot;recaptures the naivety and innocence of an age and a place far removed from the whirl and pressure of a sophisticated society&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; was the final track written for the album, but it was one that Enya recalled was difficult to work on and which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed over a period of time until &quot;we were able at the end to listen to it and say &#x27;this is good&#x27;&quot;. It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested playing a melody in five octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line &quot;Sail away...&quot; after every line that Dickins later said &quot;drove me crazy&quot;, but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams&#x27; 1963 single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, was the genesis of Roma&#x27;s inspiration for the song&#x27;s lyrics after she had heard the introduction as she looked out of the studio window and saw her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: &quot;We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies&quot;, the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as Ross Dependency. Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed, which embarrassed him at first, and initially he wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. &quot;All these years later&quot;, he said, &quot;if I hear that line ... I can&#x27;t help smiling.&quot;

&quot;Evening Falls...&quot; is a track that Roma described as &quot;a song of a spirit travelling&quot;. It is based on a ghost story that Roma had heard about a woman who had recurring dreams of a house in America, only to accidentally come across it years later in England. Upon entering the house, its inhabitants become frightened of the woman as they explain she had haunted the house each time she dreamed about it. Nicky thought a melody Enya had written suited the story, which led to Roma writing a lyric inspired by it.

&quot;River&quot; is an instrumental that was named by Nicky after the music conjured the image of a river in his mind. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles, but she liked his suggestion and went with it. The track was recorded in roughly ten minutes with Enya playing directly to tape. Nicky spoke about Enya&#x27;s style of composing for song: &quot;There are five synths midi&#x27;d but then she plays chords over these random arpeggiators with notes popping in and out where you don&#x27;t expect them. Somehow she makes that work&quot;. A PPG Wave keyboard was used afterwards for additional sounds.

&quot;The Longships&quot; makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841.

&quot;Na Laetha Geal M&#x27;óige&quot;, translated from Irish as &quot;The Brighter Days of My Youth&quot;, is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya&#x27;s childhood, and receives a dedication in Irish to her grandparents.

== Artwork ==

The sleeve to &quot;Watermark&quot; was illustrated to a design painted by graphic designer Laurence Dunmore. The cover image of Enya was shot by David Hiscook with additional photography by Russel Yamy, with &quot;layers and layers of imagery&quot; hand-drawn on top. Dickins realised its sleeve design was an important aspect in its marketing campaign to ensure the album&#x27;s success as it was &quot;not the kind of music that slots easily into Radio 1 ... It had to be the kind of sleeve you&#x27;d fall in love with ... And I think it works that way – the effect in window displays is stunning.&quot; Enya was &quot;very happy&quot; with the cover, calling it &quot;very classic&quot; and &quot;in taste with the music&quot;, not portraying her as the latest &quot;girl on the scene&quot; when compared to other female solo artists at the time, such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue. The artwork provided the inspiration to the music video for &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;. Dickins decided against the inclusion of a detailed set of liner notes and lyrics with their translations as it encouraged the listener to conjure up their own images and understanding when they play it, a decision that Enya supported.

== Release and commercial performance ==
To generate interest in the album, Warner organised a private album launch reception at the Serpentine Gallery within Hyde Park and the Westbury Hotel in London, one week prior to its release. &quot;Watermark&quot; was released on 19 September 1988 in the United Kingdom; its release in the United States followed on 10 January 1989 by Geffen Records The album was a success on the charts, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 46 for the week of 15 October 1988 before a three-week climb to its peak of number five. In its initial run the album spent 54 weeks on the chart, returning each year from 1989 to 1995 for a total 99 weeks. In the United States, it debuted the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 100, the week of 4 February 1989. The album had a steady climb, and reached its peak at 25 on the week ending 22 April 1989. It was present on the chart for a total of 39 weeks. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums chart, the album reached its peak position of number two during its 286-week stay. Elsewhere, the album went to number one in New Zealand and Switzerland.

By January 1989, &quot;Watermark&quot; had sold over 20,000 copies in Ireland and 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Five years later, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 1.2 million copies. In the United States, &quot;Watermark&quot; sold 500,000 copies in its first four months of release. After 7 years, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of four million copies. It sold one million copies in the country between March 1995 and March 1996. In November 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported the album had sold 3,877,571 copies in the United States according to figures tracked by Nielsen SoundScan since 1991. By 1994, the album spent 165 weeks on spanish charts and sold 300,000 copies in Spain. Worldwide, the album has sold an estimated 8 million copies.

Enya released four singles from &quot;Watermark&quot; between 1988 and 1991. &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; was the lead single, released on 3 October 1988 and entered the United Kingdom singles chart at twenty-nine. It climbed to number five in its second week before it reached number one in its third, staying at the top for three consecutive weeks. The single was certified silver by the BPI for 250,000 copies sold in its first month of release. Dickins observed that some of the public were confused on the song&#x27;s title and were asking shop staff for &quot;Sail Away&quot;, so he ordered to have the title changed on subsequent pressings to &quot;Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)&quot;. The single became a crossover hit in the United States after the single gained airplay on progressive rock, Top 40, and new age format radio stations. &quot;Evening Falls...&quot; was released on 12 December 1988, and peaked at number three in Ireland and number 20 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Storms in Africa&quot; followed on 5 June 1989, and reached number 12 in Ireland and 41 in the United Kingdom. In 1991, after &quot;Exile&quot; was used on the soundtracks of &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990) and &quot;L.A. Story&quot; (1991), it was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single on 20 May 1991. A music video was produced for each single with Michael Geoghegan as director, and included on the video compilation &quot;Moonshadows&quot;, released on VHS and LaserDisc by Warner Music Vision and Warner Reprise Video in 1991.

Enya embarked on a worldwide media tour which lasted from September 1988 to May 1989 and included press, radio and television interviews and appearances, record signings, and lip-sync performances of songs from &quot;Watermark&quot;. Among her performances included &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; on the British music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 19 October 1988, and &quot;Storms in Africa&quot; at the 1989 World Music Awards in Monte Carlo.

At the 32nd Grammy Awards in 1990, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; was nominated for Best New Age Performance and Best Music Video.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Watermark&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. In an April 1988 review, &quot;Hot Press&quot; reporter Liam Fay wrote the album is &quot;A lifetime&#x27;s worth of sights, sounds and experiences condescend into an orderly and lucid aural aquarium&quot;. He praised her orchestral-like vocals on &quot;Cursum Perficio&quot;, the instrumentation on &quot;Storms in Africa&quot;, &quot;The Longships&quot;, and &quot;Exile&quot;, and the &quot;exquisite liqueous pop&quot; of &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; which, as he predicted, &quot;should be a hit single&quot;. Fay was aware that lyrics in such types of music can be the weak point, but deemed Roma&#x27;s lyrics are &quot;integral and are ideally sculpted to allow Enya&#x27;s voice to float between the gaps and pauses&quot;. Fay also felt &quot;Na Laetha Geal M&#x27;óige&quot;, &quot;On Your Shore&quot;, and &quot;Evening Falls...&quot; sound &quot;too hymn-like for their own good&quot;, and pale in comparison to the rest of the album and Ryan&#x27;s production &quot;reveals a different hue&quot; each time one listens to it. Joe Brown praised it in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, calling it &quot;a lovely collection of quasi-mystical pop&quot; that is &quot;somewhere outside of the pop mainstream but steering clear of the sugary shoals of New Age&quot;. He described &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; as &quot;lushly romantic&quot; and praised the production on &quot;Evening Falls...&quot; and &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot;, which evoke a &quot;cathedral ambience, with multitracked choirs and shimmering echo&quot;.

A review by Bill Henderson was printed in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, with Henderson giving the album four stars out of five and writing: &quot;Delicate. That adjective describes the melodies of Enya&quot; whose &quot;art becomes the sum of its parts – as light as a whisper, yet as strong as a scream&quot;. He compared her methods to English singer Claire Hamill but &quot;much better&quot;, and praised her personal songs like &quot;On Your Shore&quot; to invite the listener to recall homes of their past, &quot;a bittersweet journey&quot;. While the instrumental tracks to him are &quot;simple and pleasant musical ideas&quot;, they are overshadowed by her vocal tracks, as &quot;Her singing is so strong that it is painfully obvious when she isn&#x27;t&quot;. He deemed &quot;Na Laetha Geal M&#x27;oige&quot; &quot;one of the most beautiful melodies recorded by anyone recently&quot; that is sung with such conviction, the Irish lyrics do not affect the music.

The November 1988 edition of &quot;Top&quot; magazine, run by Tower Records, included a review by Simon Young who thought Enya had produced &quot;a fine, peaceful New Age album, which works best when her voice-from-heaven is matched with subtle electronic pools of sound and layer upon layer of breathy, Clannadesque backing vocals&quot;. Jonathan Takiff, for the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, started his review with: &quot;When this old world starts getting you down, just lay on ... &quot;Watermark&quot; ... and drift away to a blissful state&quot;, of which Enya brings a &quot;fusion of old sod balladry and modem technology to another plateau, with a magical, mysterious brew that could be dubbed &quot;New Age Irish&quot; or &quot;Celtic Ambient&quot;&quot;. Takiff picked &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; as the stand out song, and called &quot;River&quot; a &quot;blissful instrumental&quot;. He concluded with: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing uptempo to ever jar the hypnotic ebb and flow. Just lay back and let this music roll all over you.&quot; In a review printed in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Steve Morse called the record a &quot;series of lush dreamscapes that team the vocal beauty of Irish traditional song with multitracked synthesizer tones&quot;, and compared it to works from fellow ambient and new age artists Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Brian Eno. Its sound, he thought, is &quot;beautiful&quot; and noticed a recurrence of the imagery of water throughout. Morse concluded, &quot;This is an album of atmospheres – true mood music for the soul&quot;.

Helena Mulkerns in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;a rich mood piece of broad proportions&quot; and &quot;a glorious aural mosaic&quot;. The title track &quot;sails the listener gently into an ebb-and-flow movement that permeates the album&quot; that contains multi-vocals she described as &quot;distinctive&quot; and &quot;striking&quot;. She thought Roma&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;unornamented but compelling&quot;, and that its multi-lingual touches &quot;enrich&quot; the listening experience without becoming too dominating. Kristine McKenna, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote a critical review, describing it as &quot;a portentous pastiche that&#x27;s drawn comparisons to ecclesiastical choir and Gregorian chant, but in fact sounds like nothing more than unusually windy New Age music&quot; that &quot;makes for bland, bloodless music ideal for elevators; this is a record about sound rather than lyrics, melody, or any of the other things that invest music with emotion and ideas.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau labelled the album a &quot;must to avoid&quot; and said Enya exploits popular music&#x27;s &quot;old reliable women-are-angels scam&quot; while &quot;humanizing technology, perpetrating banal verse in three languages (I&#x27;m guessing about the Gaelic after reading the English and figuring out the Latin), and mentioning Africa, the Orinoco, and other deep dark faraway places&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett said the record &quot;established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age music&quot; with a subtlety that produced strong tracks as a result.

<text>Thomas Ford (c. 1580buried 17 November 1648) was an English composer, lutenist, viol player and poet.

==Life==
Ford was attached to the court of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of James I, who died in 1612. He was a musician to the household of Prince Henry from 1610 to 1612, a musician to the household of Prince Charles from 1617 to 1625, and a musician to Charles I from 1626 to 1642, the outbreak of the English Civil War. His will was made on 12 November 1648 and he was buried in St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 17 November, but it is not known exactly when he died.

Ford wrote anthems, for three to six voices; four sacred canons; 35 partsongs; six fantasias for five parts; and a few other pieces for viols.

His most important collection was probably the &quot;Musicke of Sundrie Kindes&quot; (London, 1607), which was in two parts. The first book included lute ayres, described as &quot;Aries for 4 voices to the Lute, Orphorion, or Basse-viol, with a Dialogue for two Voices...&quot;; the second part contained dances such as &quot;Pavens, Galiards, Almaines, Toies, Jigges, Thumpes, and such like...&quot; scored for combinations of viols. Many of the ayres are given in two versions: one for voice or voices and lute, and another for four equal voices. An unusual feature of his music for viol is the 
&quot;occasional use of a sound effect: a heavy pizzicato &quot;thump...with the first and second finger of the &quot;Tleft hand according to the direction of the pricks.&quot; One of the songs from this collection, &quot;Since first I saw your face&quot;, was set by Roger Quilter in 1942 for the &quot;Arnold Book of Old Songs&quot;. The collection also includes the celebrated song &quot;There is a Lady sweet and Kind&quot;. Ford is also remembered for setting to music the poem, &#x27;Yet if His Majesty Our Sovereign Lord&#x27;.

Some of his sacred music, found in two collections from 1614 and 1620, is unusual in including a basso continuo, a plainly Baroque feature which, though common on the continent by then, only made a belated appearance in England.

Together with John Dowland, Ford is a chief representative of the school which preceded Henry Lawes.

<text>Zwartsluis is a small city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Zwartewaterland, at the mouth of the Zwarte Water river and the .

== History ==

Zwartsluis&#x27;s history started in the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648): it developed around the Swartersluys fortress, which controlled traffic on the Zwartewater inlet leading to Hasselt and Zwolle. Zwartsluis attracted some trade and a fishing fleet in later centuries. Zwartsluis also served as a consolidation point for the peat-fuel trade, but was surpassed in importance by its neighbours, especially downstream Genemuiden.

The Dutch Reformed Church of Zwartsluis is a historic Dutch Reformed church building located on the Kerkstraat and the organ in the church is a designated Rijksmonument.

== Recreation ==
The town is home to many recreational boats, as well as a heritage fleet of fishing and cargo vessels. The Arembergergracht canal links the town with the Beulaker and Belter lakes and a multitude of smaller bodies of water just north, created by peat digging.

== Government ==
Zwartsluis was a separate municipality until 2001, when it became a part of Zwartewaterland.

== Notable people ==
* Stieneke van der Graaf (born 1984), politician (MP)

<text>The Carnutes or Carnuti (Gaulish: &#x27;the horned ones&#x27;), were a Gallic tribe dwelling in an extensive territory between the Sequana (Seine) and the Liger (Loire) rivers during the Iron Age and the Roman period.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Carnutes&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Livy (late-1st c. BC), &quot;Carnūti&quot; by Tibullus (late-1st c. BC), &quot;Karnoútōn&quot; (Καρνούτων) and &quot;Karnoúntōn&quot; (Καρνούντων) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), &quot;Karnoũtai&quot; (Καρνοῦται) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), and as &quot;Carnunta&quot; in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (5th c. AD).

The Gaulish ethnonym &quot;Carnutes&quot; literally means &#x27;the horned ones&#x27;, probably in reference to their combat helmets. It stems from the Gaulish root &quot;carno-&quot; (&#x27;horn&#x27;), itself from Proto-Celtic *&quot;karno-&quot; (&#x27;horn, hoof&#x27;; cf. Middle Welsh &quot;carn&quot; &#x27;hoof&#x27;). The name &quot;Carnutes&quot; is linguistically related to the Brittonic &quot;*Kornouii&quot; and the Welsh &quot;Kernyw&quot;, designating the Cornwall region.

The city of Chartres, attested ca. 400 as &quot;Carnotum&quot; (&quot;Carnotis&quot; ca. 650, &quot;Cartis&quot; in 930), is named after the Gallic tribe.

== Geography ==
Their lands were later organized as the Catholic dioceses of Chartres, Orléans and Blois, that is, the greater part of the modern departments of Eure-et-Loir, Loiret and Loir-et-Cher. The territory of the Carnutes had the reputation among Roman observers of being the political and religious center of the Gaulish nations. The chief fortified towns were &quot;Cenabum&quot; (mistakenly labeled &quot;Genabum&quot;), the modern Orléans, where a bridge crossed the Loire, and &quot;Autricum&quot; (or &quot;Carnutes&quot;, thus Chartres). The great annual druidic assembly mentioned by Caesar took place in one or the other of these towns. Livy&#x27;s history records the legendary tradition that the Carnutes had been one of the tribes that accompanied Bellovesus in his invasion of Italy during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus.

== History ==

In the 1st century BC, the Carnutes minted coins, usually struck with dies, but sometimes cast in an alloy of high tin content called &quot;potin.&quot; Their coinage turns up in hoards well outside their home territories, in some cases so widely distributed in the finds that the place of coinage is not secure. The iconography of their numismatics includes the motifs of heads with traditional Celtic torcs; a wolf with a star; a galloping horse; and the triskelion. Many coins show an eagle with the lunar crescent, with a serpent, or with a wheel with six or four spokes, or a pentagrammatic star, or beneath a hand holding a branch with berries, holly perhaps. The wheel with four spokes forms a cross within a circle, an almost universal image since Neolithic times. Sometimes the circle is a ring of granules. Among the Celts, the ring and spokes may represent the cycle of the year divided in its four seasons, rather than the sun, which is a common meaning among cultures. See Cross.

In the time of Caesar, the Carnutes were dependents of the Remi, who on one occasion interceded for them. In the winter of 58–57 BC, Caesar imposed a protectorate over the Carnutes and set up Tasgetius as his choice of king, picked from the ruling clan. Within three years, the Carnutes assassinated the puppet king. On 13 February 53 BC, the Carnutes of Cenabum massacred all the Roman merchants stationed in the town as well as one of Caesar&#x27;s commissariat officers. The uprising became a general one throughout Gaul, under the leadership of Vercingetorix. Caesar burned Cenabum, where he had the men killed and women and children sold as slaves. The booty was distributed among his soldiers, an effective way of financing the conquest of Gaul. During the war that followed, the Carnutes sent 12,000 fighting men to relieve Alesia, but shared in the defeat of the Gallic army. Having attacked the Bituriges, who appealed to Caesar for assistance, they were forced to submit. Cenabum was left for years as a mass of ruins for example, with two Roman legions garrisoned there.

After they had been pacified, though not Romanized, under Augustus, the Carnutes, as one of the peoples of Gallia Lugdunensis, were raised to the rank of &quot;civitas socia&quot; or &quot;foederati.&quot; They retained their self-governing institutions, and minted coins; their only obligation was for the men to render military service to the emperor. Up to the 3rd century, Autricum (later Carnutes, whence Chartres) was the capital. In 275 Aurelian refounded Cenabum, ordaining it no longer a &quot;vicus&quot; but a &quot;civitas;&quot; he named it &quot;Aurelianum&quot; or &quot;Aurelianensis urbs&quot; (which eventually became &quot;Orléans&quot;).

<text>Desmond George King-Hele FRS (3November 192725December 2019) was a British physicist, poet and author who crossed the divide between the arts and science to write extensively about the life of Erasmus Darwin, whom he linked with the romantic poets Shelley, Wordsworth, and Coleridge. In 1957, together with Doreen Gilmour, and as part of the Guided Weapons department of Royal Aircraft Establishment, he wrote a report proposing the use of the Blue Streak missile and Black Knight as a satellite launcher. See also: Blue Streak Satellite Launch Vehicle.

==Life and career==
He was born in Seaford, Sussex, the son of Sidney G. and Bessie (née Sayer) King-Hele and was educated at Epsom College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

He joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough in 1948 and stayed there until 1988, researching the gravity of Earth and its upper atmosphere by satellite orbit determination. He was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1971 for his work on the geophysical application of the study of the orbits of artificial satellites. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in March 1966 and gave the Bakerian lecture in 1974 and the Wilkins Lecture in 1997. 2019 he was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Derby.

He is considered &quot;one of the pioneers of space geodesy&quot;.
Based on satellite geodesy, King-Hele refined the estimate for Earth&#x27;s pear shape, finding a 45 m difference between north and south polar radii.

He married Marie Newman in 1954; they had two daughters.

He won the Chree medal and prize in 1971.

In 1973, he correctly predicted that Skylab would re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in 1979.

King-Hele died on 25 December 2019.

<text>NGC 3603 is a nebula situated in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way around 20,000 light-years away from the Solar System. It is a massive H II region containing a very compact open cluster (probably a super star cluster) HD 97950.

==Observations==

NGC 3603 was observed by John Herschel on 14 March 1834 during his visit to South Africa, who remarked that it was &quot;a very remarkable object...perhaps a globular cluster&quot;. Herschel catalogued it as nebula 3334 in his &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;, published in 1847. In 1864 the Royal Society published his &quot;General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters&quot;, where he listed it as number 2354. It was subsequently incorporated into the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot; as by J. L. E. Dreyer as NGC 3603.

The central cluster was catalogued as the star HD 97950, but has long been recognised as nebulous or multiple. It was also noted for having an unusual emission spectrum and the spectral type was given as Oe in the Henry Draper Catalogue. This was later refined to WN5 + O as the emission was recognised as characteristic of a Wolf–Rayet star. Eventually, the cluster would be resolved and found to contain three of the most massive and most luminous stars known, as well as a number of luminous O class stars and many fainter stars.

==Features==

NGC 3603 is the most massive visible cloud of glowing gas and plasma, known as a H II region, in the Milky Way. The central star cluster is the densest concentration of very massive stars known in the galaxy. Strong ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds have cleared the gas and dust, giving an unobscured view of the cluster.

Three prominent Wolf–Rayet stars have been detected within the cluster, all originally unresolved and known as the single star HD 97950. The brightest of the three, HD 97950A1 (or NGC 3603-A1) is actually a pair of Wolf–Rayet stars that orbit around each other once every 3.77 days. The primary is an estimated mass , while its companion is . The star designated HD 97950B is a single star more massive and more luminous than either of the individual members of HD 97950A1. It is 2,880,000 times as luminous as the sun and 132 times as massive.

NGC 3603 is visible in the telescope as a small rather insignificant nebulosity with a yellowish tinge due to the effects of interstellar absorption. In the mid-1960s, optical studies combined with radio astronomical observations showed it to be an extremely strong thermal radio source. Later observations of other galaxies introduced the concept of starburst regions, in some cases whole galaxies, of extremely rapid star formation. NGC 3603 is now considered to be such a region, and it has been compared by some authors to the larger cluster 30 Doradus, in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Sher 25, the B class supergiant on the outskirts of NGC 3603, is surrounded by ejected material in an hourglass shape similar to that found for the supernova 1987A, and this has aroused intense interest in the future evolution of stars such as Sher 25.

Two of the most luminous young stars known are found within NGC 3603, but outside the central cluster. WR 42e and NGC 3603 MTT 58 both have a spectral type of O2If*/WN6 indicating an extremely massive young star. WR 42e is a possible runaway from a three-body encounter, while MTT 58 appears to still be embedded within its parental cocoon and is in a possible binary with an O3If star.

<text>Burum (West Frisian language: &quot;Boerum&quot;) is a village in Noardeast-Fryslân municipality, Friesland in the Netherlands.

It is the site of a ground station of the Dutch Nationale SIGINT Organisatie (national signals intelligence service), which intercepts satellite communications. Burum also provides reference signals for Enhanced Automatic Frequency Correction, which help calibrates satellite communications.

It had a population of 606 in January 2017.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1408 as Burum, and means neighbourhood. Burum is a &quot;terp&quot; (artificial living mound) village. An output of the monastery of Gerkesklooster was established near the village. During the 13th or 14th century the area around Burum was &quot;poldered&quot;. The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1784 as a replacement of a medieval church.

The grist mill Windlust was built in 1787 near Burum. In 2012, it burnt down and in 2014, a near identical new wind mill was built. The windmill is operation, but only on a voluntary basis.

In 1840, Burum was home to 1,121 people. In 1973, the satellite communication centre opened near Burum. In 2014, the ground station of the Dutch national signals intelligence service was added to the site.

<text>In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics, a hyperbolic trajectory or hyperbolic orbit is the trajectory of any object around a central body with more than enough speed to escape the central object&#x27;s gravitational pull. The name derives from the fact that according to Newtonian theory such an orbit has the shape of a hyperbola. In more technical terms this can be expressed by the condition that the orbital eccentricity is greater than one.

Under simplistic assumptions a body traveling along this trajectory will coast towards infinity, settling to a final excess velocity relative to the central body. Similarly to parabolic trajectories, all hyperbolic trajectories are also escape trajectories. The specific energy of a hyperbolic trajectory orbit is positive.

Planetary flybys, used for gravitational slingshots, can be described within the planet&#x27;s sphere of influence using hyperbolic trajectories.

==Parameters describing a hyperbolic trajectory==
Like an elliptical orbit, a hyperbolic trajectory for a given system can be defined (ignoring orientation) by its semi major axis and the eccentricity. However, with a hyperbolic orbit other parameters may be more useful in understanding a body&#x27;s motion. The following table lists the main parameters describing the path of body following a hyperbolic trajectory around another under standard assumptions and the formula connecting them.

===Semi-major axis, energy and hyperbolic excess velocity===
The semi major axis (formula_1) is not immediately visible with a hyperbolic trajectory but can be constructed as it is the distance from periapsis to the point where the two asymptotes cross. Usually, by convention, it is negative, to keep various equations consistent with elliptical orbits.

The semi major axis is directly linked to the specific orbital energy (formula_2) or characteristic energy formula_3 of the orbit, and to the velocity the body attains at as the distance tends to infinity, the hyperbolic excess velocity (formula_4). 
:formula_5 or formula_6
where: formula_7 is the standard gravitational parameter and formula_3 is characteristic energy, commonly used in planning interplanetary missions

Note that the total energy is positive in the case of a hyperbolic trajectory (whereas it is negative for an elliptical orbit).

=== Eccentricity and angle between approach and departure===
With a hyperbolic trajectory the orbital eccentricity (formula_9) is greater than 1. The eccentricity is directly related to the angle between the asymptotes. With eccentricity just over 1 the hyperbola is a sharp &quot;v&quot; shape. At formula_10 the asymptotes are at right angles. With formula_11 the asymptotes are more than 120° apart, and the periapsis distance is greater than the semi major axis. As eccentricity increases further the motion approaches a straight line.

The angle between the direction of periapsis and an asymptote from the central body is the true anomaly as distance tends to infinity (formula_12), so formula_13 is the external angle between approach and departure directions (between asymptotes). Then

:formula_14 or formula_15

=== Impact parameter and the distance of closest approach ===
The impact parameter is the distance by which a body, if it continued on an unperturbed path, would miss the central body at its closest approach. With bodies experiencing gravitational forces and following hyperbolic trajectories it is equal to the semi-minor axis of the hyperbola.

In the situation of a spacecraft or comet approaching a planet, the impact parameter and excess velocity will be known accurately. If the central body is known the trajectory can now be found, including how close the approaching body will be at periapsis. If this is less than planet&#x27;s radius an impact should be expected. The distance of closest approach, or periapsis distance, is given by:
:formula_16

So if a comet approaching Earth (effective radius ~6400 km) with a velocity of 12.5 km/s (the approximate minimum approach speed of a body coming from the outer Solar System) is to avoid a collision with Earth, the impact parameter will need to be at least 8600 km, or 34% more than the Earth&#x27;s radius. A body approaching Jupiter (radius 70000 km) from the outer Solar System with a speed of 5.5 km/s, will need the impact parameter to be at least 770,000 km or 11 times Jupiter radius to avoid collision.

If the mass of the central body is not known, its standard gravitational parameter, and hence its mass, can be determined by the deflection of the smaller body together with the impact parameter and approach speed. Because typically all these variables can be determined accurately, a spacecraft flyby will provide a good estimate of a body&#x27;s mass.

:formula_17 where formula_18 is the angle the smaller body is deflected from a straight line in its course.

==Equations of motion==

===Position===

In a hyperbolic trajectory the true anomaly formula_19 is linked to the distance between the orbiting bodies (formula_20) by the orbit equation:

:formula_21

The relation between the true anomaly and the eccentric anomaly &quot;E&quot; (alternatively the hyperbolic anomaly &quot;H&quot;) is:

:formula_22     or     formula_23     or   formula_24

The eccentric anomaly &quot;E&quot; is related to the mean anomaly &quot;M&quot; by Kepler&#x27;s equation:

:formula_25

The mean anomaly is proportional to time

:formula_26 where &quot;μ&quot; is a gravitational parameter and &quot;a&quot; is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

===Flight path angle===

The flight path angle (φ) is the angle between the direction of velocity and the perpendicular to the radial direction, so it is zero at periapsis and tends to 90 degrees at infinity.

:formula_27

===Velocity===

Under standard assumptions the orbital speed (formula_28) of a body traveling along a hyperbolic trajectory can be computed from the &quot;vis-viva&quot; equation as:
:formula_29
where:
*formula_30 is standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_20 is radial distance of orbiting body from central body,
*formula_1 is the absolute value (distance) of the semi-major axis.

Under standard assumptions, at any position in the orbit the following relation holds for orbital velocity (formula_28), local escape velocity (formula_34) and hyperbolic excess velocity (formula_4):
:formula_36

Note that this means that a relatively small extra delta-&quot;v&quot; above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed results in a relatively large speed at infinity. For example, at a place where escape speed is 11.2 km/s, the addition of 0.4 km/s yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02 km/s.
:formula_37

This is an example of the Oberth effect. The converse is also true - a body does not need to be slowed by much compared to its hyperbolic excess speed (e.g. by atmospheric drag near periapsis) for velocity to fall below escape velocity and so for the body to be captured.

==Radial hyperbolic trajectory==
A radial hyperbolic trajectory is a non-periodic trajectory on a straight line where the relative speed of the two objects always exceeds the escape velocity. There are two cases: the bodies move away from each other or towards each other. This is a hyperbolic orbit with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1 this is not a parabolic orbit.

==Deflection with finite sphere of influence==
A more accurate formula for the deflection angle formula_38 considering the sphere of influence radius formula_39 of the deflecting body, assuming a periapsis formula_40 is:
:formula_41

==Relativistic two-body problem==
In context of the two-body problem in general relativity, trajectories of objects with enough energy to escape the gravitational pull of the other no longer are shaped like a hyperbola. Nonetheless, the term &quot;hyperbolic trajectory&quot; is still used to describe orbits of this type.

<text>Heiligerlee (; ) is a village in the Dutch province of Groningen bordering the town of Winschoten, it is part of the municipality of Oldambt. It was the site of the 1536 Battle and the 1568 Battle of Heiligerlee

== History ==
From the year 1230 till the year 1594 a Norbertine nunnery (Mons Sinaï) stood in the village, the name of which is currently used as the name of the village Christian primary school.

The 1536 Battle of Heiligerlee was part of the Guelders Wars. The Danish allies of Guelders were defeated by Habsburg forces.

The 1568 Battle of Heiligerlee was the first battle that the Dutch rebels won against the Spanish. The army led by Louis and Adolf of Nassau defeated the Spanish, but politically it was no success. Adolf even died during the fight. It was the first battle of importance fought in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and therefore often marked as its beginning.

On the 300th anniversary of the battle in 1868 the then ruling king William III of the Netherlands revealed a monument in commemoration of the battle.

From 1908 to 1934, the Heiligerlee railway stop on the Harlingen-Nieuweschans railway was located in the village.

<doc id="996915" wikidata="Q5036526" url="?curid=996915" title="Captain Aardvark">
<text>Captain &quot;Aarfy&quot; Aardvark is a fictional character, a major antagonist in the 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; by Joseph Heller. Aarfy is the plump navigator in Yossarian&#x27;s B-25, noted for being oblivious to incoming flak, getting lost on missions, and his omnipresent pipe. His nickname &quot;Aarfy&quot; is an abbreviation of his surname, Aardvark.

==Character sketch==
===Motivation===
Aarfy is a social climber looking to work his way up into high society.

===Goal(s)===
Aarfy befriends Nately because Nately&#x27;s father is rich, and he hopes to work for him after the war.

Aarfy perceives himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers, looking for any possibility of self-advance within society. &quot;Old Aarfy has never paid for it&quot;, he often says in reference to prostitutes. He often and openly commits rape, and says he can tell which girl is &quot;nice and clean&quot; and which is not.

===Relationships and conflict(s)===

Yossarian is constantly infuriated by Aarfy during missions, who appears to have no fear of flak and always gets in Yossarian&#x27;s way when he is trying to get back to the escape hatch, away from the bombardier position in the nose.

Aarfy tries to be friends with Nately, in the hope that his father will give Aarfy an important job after the war for this service. Nately realizes that Aarfy is a &quot;climber,&quot; though, and sees the other officers more as his friends.

Aarfy helps to protect women with social connections from the sexual advances of the other officers, much to their dismay, hoping that these connections will later be of use. Unlike the other officers, Aarfy is not willing to pay for sex with a prostitute, but perversely he has no regrets when he rapes and murders the innocent maid Michaela; when asked by Yossarian why he did not simply hire a prostitute, he repeats his common admonition that &quot;Old Aarfy has never paid for it&quot;, and shows no remorse.

===Epiphany===
When Yossarian starts to convince Aarfy that he will have to pay for the rape and murder of Michaela, for the first time in the novel he loses his composure and shows fear. His fear is not realized, though, as when the police arrive, they instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL and not Aarfy. His reprehensible actions are therefore vindicated and he can be satisfied that the system is there to protect him.

==Biographical summary==
===Actions in &quot;Catch-22&quot;===
====On mission====
During dangerous missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy to get out of the way so he can get to the escape hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him, infuriating Yossarian even more, and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts, Aarfy never can hear him (except when he says &quot;never mind&quot;). On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy, but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian&#x27;s frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up, leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless.

He nearly gets himself and his comrades killed several times while getting lost on mission:
*Over Ferrara, when Yossarian went round a second time to bomb the bridge and Kraft and his plane&#x27;s crew were killed.
*On a milk run to Parma, where Aarfy led the planes over the city of Livorno and Yossarian got hit in the leg by flak.
*With Colonel Cathcart, where the plane almost got shot down.

Aarfy is so heedless of his own personal safety and the well-being of others that it always astounds him when they become angry at him.

====Social climbing====
Aarfy throughout the novel tries to befriend Nately, as a means of getting in favor with his wealthy father:

:&quot;he had already fallen truly in love with Nately&#x27;s father and the prospect of working for him after the war in some executive capacity as a reward for befriending Nately.&quot;

The irony is that Nately actually sees his friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe, and Dunbar whom his parents would not be impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.

The girls upstairs and the cameo woman – protects them from the sexual advances of the officers, not for his own pleasure, but because he sees them as women connected to important men who could help him out after the war.

====Fraternity life====
Aarfy views women as purely a means to an end, whether it is for sex or for social connections. He advises Nately that if he wants to keep his prostitute in the apartment in Rome one night, then pay for them to stay till after curfew and then they will be obliged to stay and do what ever they want. He gives an example when he has done this before in his fraternity days:

:“I remember one day we tricked two dumb high-school girls from town into the fraternity house and made them put out for all the fellows there who wanted them by threatening to call up their parents and say they were putting out for us. We kept them trapped in bed for more than ten hours. We even smacked their faces a little when they started to complain. Then we took away their nickels and dimes and chewing gum and threw them out.”

====Michaela====
Toward the end of the novel, Aarfy rapes and murders a maid, Michaela, while on leave in Rome. This inadvertently forms the emotional center of the novel. When an aghast Yossarian tells him that he will be arrested and possibly executed, Aarfy laughs dismissively that no one would do that to &quot;good old Aarfy&quot;:
:&quot;But I only raped her once!&quot; he explained.
:Yossarian was aghast. &quot;But you killed her, Aarfy! You killed her!&quot;
:&quot;Oh, I had to do that after I had raped her,&quot; Aarfy replied in his most condescending manner. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t very well let her go around saying bad things about us, could I?&quot;
:&quot;But why did you have to touch her at all, you dumb bastard?&quot; Yossarian shouted. &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t you get yourself a girl off the street if you wanted one? The city is full of prostitutes.&quot;
:&quot;Oh, no, not me,&quot; Aarfy bragged. &quot;I never paid for it in my life.&quot; 
His insouciant view is vindicated when the police arriving on the scene show no interest in Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL.

==Major themes==
===Catch-22===
Yossarian&#x27;s frustration with Aarfy during missions is analogous to his frustration with &quot;Catch-22,&quot; whereby no matter how loud he shouts or hard he fights he can not affect Aarfy, who carries on regardless. Similarly one can not fight &quot;Catch-22.&quot;

Aarfy&#x27;s character exemplifies the perversity of a society and culture governed by Catch-22s that ultimately serve to protect the powerful. Other, more considerate members of the squadron suffer ignominious or horrible fates while he—merely oblivious and inconsiderate for most of the novel—faces no negative consequences even when his self-absorption drives him to murder. In his reactions to flak, and to rape and murder, Aarfy demonstrates complete insanity. Hence he survives and prospers in a completely insane world.

===Attitude towards women===
Unlike the other officers, most notably Yossarian and Hungry Joe, Aarfy does not outwardly show any signs of lust in the novel. He generally sees women as objects of distaste (as in the prostitutes the officers pay for) or as a means for social climbing. Although he believes that he is showing them due courtesy, he is not actually respecting these women for who they are, but just using them as a means to an end.

== Portrayals ==
In Mike Nichols&#x27; 1970 film adaptation of the novel, Aarfy is played by Charles Grodin. In the 2019 Hulu miniseries, he is played by Rafi Gavron.

<text>Edward Russell Helwer (born December 20, 1940) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba legislature from 1988 to 2003. Although the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party was in power for most of this period, Helwer was never appointed to a cabinet position (though he did serve as Party Whip at one point).

Helwer was born in Selkirk, Manitoba. He worked as an Esso agent from 1963 to 1974, and was a Macleod Authorized Dealer from 1974 to 1983. From 1976 to 1996, he was also the owner of a small business called &quot;Rockwood Farm Supplies&quot;. Helwer served as a municipal councillor in Teulon from 1969 to 1973 and 1977 to 1980, and was the town&#x27;s Mayor from 1980 to 1988. He was also chair of the &quot;Hunter Hospital Board&quot; from 1977 to 1987.

Helwer first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, losing to New Democratic Party incumbent John Bucklaschuk by about 950 votes in the riding of Gimli. In the 1988 election (called after the NDP government lost a budget vote and held during a period of unpopularity for the party), Helwer defeated Bucklaschuk by about 1400 votes to win the riding.

Helwer was re-elected easily in the 1990 election, and was able to defeat NDP challenger Fran Frederickson by about 1800 votes in 1995. He faced Frederickson again in the 1999 election, and saw his majority cut to only 402 votes; the NDP were victorious in the province, and Helwer became Progressive Conservative critic for Government Services and Emergency Management in the opposition.

Helwer did not seek re-election in 2003, and the Gimli riding was subsequently won by the New Democratic Party again.

Helwer was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002.

<doc id="996933" wikidata="Q4119753" url="?curid=996933" title="Style sheet (web development)">
<text>A web style sheet is a form of separation of content and presentation for web design in which the markup (i.e., HTML or XHTML) of a webpage contains the page&#x27;s semantic content and structure, but does not define its visual layout (style). Instead, the style is defined in an external style sheet file using a style sheet language such as CSS or XSLT. This design approach is identified as a &quot;separation&quot; because it largely supersedes the antecedent methodology in which a page&#x27;s markup defined both style and structure.

The philosophy underlying this methodology is a specific case of separation of concerns.

==Benefits==
Separation of style and content has advantages, but has only become practical after improvements in popular web browsers&#x27; CSS implementations.

===Speed===
Overall, users experience of a site utilising style sheets will generally be quicker than sites that don’t use the technology. ‘Overall’ as the first page will probably load more slowly – because the style sheet AND the content will need to be transferred. Subsequent pages will load faster because no style information will need to be downloaded – the CSS file will already be in the browser’s cache.

===Maintainability===
Holding all the presentation styles in one file can reduce the maintenance time and reduces the chance of error, thereby improving presentation consistency. For example, the font color associated with a type of text element may be specified — and therefore easily modified — throughout an entire website simply by changing one short string of characters in a single file. The alternative approach, using styles embedded in each individual page, would require a cumbersome, time consuming, and error-prone edit of every file.

===Accessibility===
Sites that use CSS with either XHTML or HTML are easier to tweak so that they appear similar in different browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc.).

Sites using CSS &quot;degrade gracefully&quot; in browsers unable to display graphical content, such as Lynx, or those so very old that they cannot use CSS. Browsers ignore CSS that they do not understand, such as CSS 3 statements. This enables a wide variety of user agents to be able to access the content of a site even if they cannot render the style sheet or are not designed with graphical capability in mind. For example, a browser using a refreshable braille display for output could disregard layout information entirely, and the user would still have access to all page content.

===Customization===

If a page&#x27;s layout information is stored externally, a user can decide to disable the layout information entirely, leaving the site&#x27;s bare content still in a readable form. Site authors may also offer multiple style sheets, which can be used to completely change the appearance of the site without altering any of its content.

Most modern web browsers also allow the user to define their own style sheet, which can include rules that override the author&#x27;s layout rules. This allows users, for example, to bold every hyperlink on every page they visit. Browser extensions like Stylish and Stylus have been created to facilitate management of such user style sheets.

===Consistency===
Because the semantic file contains only the meanings an author intends to convey, the styling of the various elements of the document&#x27;s content is very consistent. For example, headings, emphasized text, lists and mathematical expressions all receive consistently applied style properties from the external style sheet. Authors need not concern themselves with the style properties at the time of composition. These presentational details can be deferred until the moment of presentation.

===Portability===
The deferment of presentational details until the time of presentation means that a document can be easily re-purposed for an entirely different presentation medium with merely the application of a new style sheet already prepared for the new medium and consistent with elemental or structural vocabulary of the semantic document. A carefully authored document for a web page can easily be printed to a hard-bound volume complete with headers and footers, page numbers and a generated table of contents simply by applying a new style sheet.

==Practical disadvantages today==
As of 2006, specifications (for example, XHTML, XSL, CSS) and software tools implementing these specification are only reaching the early stages of maturity. So there are some practical issues facing authors who seek to embrace this method of separating content and style.

===Narrow adoption without the parsing and generation tools===
While the style specifications are quite mature and still maturing, the software tools have been slow to adapt. Most of the major web development tools still embrace a mixed presentation-content model. So authors and designers looking for GUI based tools for their work find it difficult to follow the semantic web method. In addition to GUI tools, shared repositories for generalized style sheets would probably aid adoption of these methods.

<doc id="996934" wikidata="Q2292862" url="?curid=996934" title="Astrix">
<text>Avi Shmailov, known by his stage name Astrix (Hebrew: אבי שמיילוב), is an Israeli trance music DJ and producer. His specialty lies in the subgenre of progressive psychedelic trance. In 2006, Astrix achieved the 41st position in DJMag&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 DJs&quot; annual ranking, alongside several other Israeli musicians, with Infected Mushroom ranking the highest at #9. The following year, in 2007, Astrix climbed to the 18th spot on the list, marking a significant representation of the Israeli electronic music scene in the global rankings.

==Early career==
Astrix was born in Georgia located in what was then, the USSR, to a Mountain Jewish family in the Caucasus and grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel. He began recording music under the name Astrix in 1997, sometimes misconceived to be taken from the Asterix comic books. An interview on the UK clubbing website &quot;Harderfaster.net&quot; revealed the name was chosen simply for sounding good, and not directly influenced by anything in particular.

===1995–2002===
Astrix started as a DJ in 1995 playing alternative and 1980s music. It was during this time that he learned about electronic music. In 1997 he began his first in-house studio recordings using a personal computer. He learned about trance in 1997 after being invited to a trance party. &quot;At first it was a very new and strange experience for me and I couldn&#x27;t find myself, but I was impressed by the energy and the impact that the music had made on the people at the party.&quot; At the beginning of his career in the late 1990s he produced tracks in the &quot;nitzhonot&quot; style of trance, an anthemic offshoot of Goa trance. His first tracks were &quot;In Peace&quot; and &quot;Eakhis World,&quot; which both appeared on the nitzhonot compilation &quot;Ptzatzot 3&quot;.

===2002–2010===
In 2002, Astrix signed to the EDM label HOMmega Productions with his debut album &quot;Eye to Eye&quot;. In a 2003 interview Astrix said that he worked on three albums by Alien Project, but its maintainer Ari Linker did not give him credit. Touring after the &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; album release and working on other projects did not leave much studio time for Astrix and it took two years to write his second album, &quot;Artcore&quot;, which came out in 2004. He also produced the albums &quot;Nu-clear Visions of Israel&quot; (TIP.World, 2003), &quot;Psychedelic Academy&quot; (Hit Mania, 2005) and &quot;Astrix &amp; Friends&quot; (DJ mag, 2007). In 2009, Astrix&#x27;s label, HOMmega Productions, was the first to release a digital album from Astrix on a USB flash drive, &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; (HOMmega Productions, 2009). Astrix then undertook an almost nonstop worldwide tour.

Festivals he has performed at included Dance Valley, SW4, Creamfields, Love Parade, UAF, Planeta Atlantida and headlined nights in the best clubs and venues such as Alexandra Palace, Brixton Academy, Pacha, Ministry of Sound, The city, Volume and Nox.

===2010–present===

Astrix worked on his third studio album for HOMmega productions. &quot;Red Means Distortion&quot; was released September 2010 .

The &quot;Acid Rocker&quot; EP, which was released in August 2010, was the first release from the next studio album, &quot;Red Means Distortion&quot;. As bonus material, it included a remix by trance artist Pixel of &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; featured vocalist Michele Adamson, and a fresh new GMS 2010 remix to Astrix&#x27;s &quot;Eye to Eye&quot;. In September, a month after the &quot;Acid rocker&quot; EP was released, the third album &quot;Red means distortion&quot; was released. Starting in August 2010, Astrix has been creating mix sessions titled &quot;Trance for Nations&quot;.

==Musical style==
Astrix says his music has solid, driving basslines and ascending melodies.
Many would consider his style to be a crossover between &quot;full-on&quot; and the &quot;clubbier&quot; end of Trance, exemplified by his Psychedelic Academy Mix.

Author Graham St John, of the book &quot;The Local Scenes and Global Culture of Psytrance&quot;, noted about Astrix&#x27;s sound, &quot;crisp spacious acoustics&quot;.

===Influences===
Astrix has been cited as being musically influenced by Infected Mushroom. &quot;I look up to them for inspiration and for some kind of spiritual fuel as it were.&quot; Other influences include Linkin Park and Paul Van Dyk. &quot;I also have a love for alternative bands like Linkin Park, and as electronic producer I like Paul Van Dyk, he inspires me very much to see how well you can mix business with music and how big you can become from something that was so small in the beginning.&quot;

<text>Rainford is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, Merseyside, England, north of St Helens. At the 2011 Census, the population was 7,779.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the earliest record of the village was in 1189.

==History==
Rainford is well known for its industrial past when it was a major manufacturer of clay smoking pipes. The nearby coal mines became worked out and closed before the Second World War.

Until the mid-1960s, it was also a location for sand excavation, for use in the glass factories of St Helens.

The Rookery is a large 17th-century manor house which was formerly a school and workhouse.

==Geography==

Rainford lies on a fertile agricultural plain and is effectively an urban island surrounded by large scale farming, mainly arable, but with some livestock herds.

The village consists of two main sections – the main body of the village, centred on the parish church; and Rainford Junction, a smaller settlement which has grown up around Rainford railway station. The two parts of the village are separated by a band of farmland, although they come close to meeting at the village&#x27;s north-western end.

There are three smaller villages which are near to Rainford – King&#x27;s Moss to the east, Crawford to the north-east and Crank to the south-east.

==Industry==
Agriculture has been a constant since time immemorial around Rainford.

From the mid-17th century Rainford was a centre of clay pipe manufacture. C.J. Berry speculates that this may have been due to the prevalence of Catholics in the industry, and Rainford&#x27;s history of Nonconformism and religious tolerance, in contrast to the persecution Catholics received in much of the country in the era. The type of clay used was only generally found in Devon and Cornwall, and was thus imported. The industry in the area peaked during the period c. 1800–40, in which there was little else in the village besides the clay pipe industry. Whilst other towns in the area made pipes, the industry in Rainford started earlier and continued longer. The last two pipe manufacturers retired in 1956. The clay industry continued in the area thereafter, though, with the Rainford Potteries (established 1890) making earthenware drainpipes from local clay.

==Transport==
Rainford Junction is so called because it contained the junction between the Liverpool &amp; Bury Railway&#x27;s Skelmersdale Branch and St Helens Railway, and is now home to the village&#x27;s only railway station. The railway station is on the Headbolt Lane – Manchester Victoria via Wigan line. Passengers wishing to travel to Liverpool must change at Headbolt Lane onto the Merseyrail electrified line. Rainford Village railway station, located on Cross Pit Lane, served the centre of the village from 1858 until closure in 1951. It was located on the line to St Helens Shaw Street railway station.

Rainford sits alongside the A570 (Rainford Bypass), a dual carriageway constructed in the late 1930s to supplant the original route running through the village centre. The A570 connects at one end to the East Lancashire Road (A580) and, at the other end, the M58 motorway. This results in excellent road links, and the village therefore has many inhabitants who commute to the nearby cities of Liverpool and Manchester and to St Helens.

There are bus services in Rainford; as at November 2015 Arriva North West operate service 38 which connects the village and Rainford Junction to St Helens every 30 minutes. Evening and Sunday journeys on this service are numbered 356 and go via Crank approximately hourly. HTL Buses operate the 152 from St Helens to Rainford with a few services extended to Ormskirk. The 157 goes to Ashton and is currently operated by Cumfybus, and a new service announced by Lancashire County Council will operate from Ormskirk, through to Burscough and Skelmersdale, terminating in Rainford. This service will also serve Rainford High School.

==Culture and recreation==
Rainford has many noted public houses, including the Bottle and Glass, the Junction Hotel, the Star Inn, the Derby Arms, the Golden Lion, and the Eagle and Child. It is also home to the George Wright Brewery.

Annually the village has a music festival called Picnic in the Park; profits benefit Rainford Rangers, Rainford Cricket Club, Rainford Tennis Club, and the local Boys Brigade. The 2018 headline was John Coghlan (drummer)&#x27;s Quo. The 2019 headline was Carol Decker&#x27;s T&#x27;Pau (band). 2020&#x27;s event was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 was headlined by From The Jam, 2022 by Chesney Hawkes, and 2023 by Scouting For Girls

Rainford Silver Band is highly regarded, and has won many contests A &#x27;walking day&#x27; takes place every year in June and a fairground is set up behind the Golden Lion public house, in which the silver band participate. A well-supported Rainford Show is held each year in early September in the old Rainford Urban District Council offices, with competitive classes for handicrafts, flowers, vegetables, floral art, photography etc.

==Religion==
Rainford currently has three functioning churches, with the Catholic, Church of England and United Reformed denominations having one each. There is also a nondenominational chapel in nearby Crank. The area has a history of Nonconformism, and was a stronghold of Recusancy from the Reformation until the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1832.

==Education==
Rainford currently has three primary schools and a secondary school with a large sixth form. The primary schools are Rainford Brook Lodge County Primary School, Rainford C of E Primary School and Rainford Corpus Christi Catholic Primary School. The high school and sixth form operate jointly as Rainford High School, and serve to educate pupils not just from Rainford, but from throughout St. Helens and beyond. Many pupils continue to university each year.

==Sports==
There is currently a golf course called the Northwest National Golf Club alongside the A570 dual carriageway. This new course contains 18 holes, a golf academy, restaurant and conference centre and was opened in the summer of 2009.

Rainford also has various sports clubs; A.F.C. Rainford, Rainford Tennis club &#x27;Rainford Storm&#x27; Table Tennis Club, Rainford Rangers F.C., Rainford Eagles F.C., Rainford North End F.C., Rainford Walking Football Club “Eu Ex Tribus” (RWFC est.2022) and Rainford Cricket Club.
A speedway training track was operational at some time in the early 1950s.

<doc id="996939" wikidata="Q957551" url="?curid=996939" title="Ca' Foscari">
<text>Ca&#x27; Foscari, the palace of the Foscari family, is a Gothic building on the waterfront of the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro &quot;sestiere&quot; of Venice, Italy.

It was built for the doge Francesco Foscari in 1453, and designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bon. It is now the main seat of Ca&#x27; Foscari University of Venice.

The palace is located on the widest bend of the Grand Canal. Here, during the annual &quot;Regata Storica&quot; (Historical Regatta), held on the first Sunday in September, a floating wooden structure known as &quot;La Machina&quot; is placed (from this structure the Venetian authorities watch the race); this is also the site of the finishing line, and the venue for prize-giving.

==History==
Previously a Byzantine palace, known as the &quot;House with the Two Towers&quot;, stood on the site. This was bought by the Republic of Venice in 1429 from Bernardo Giustinian, to be the residence of the vice-captain of the Republic, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. The palace consisted of two towers flanking a lower, central block and was used for entertaining illustrious guests of the Republic, including kings and diplomats. 
In 1439, the palace was given to another captain, Francesco Sforza. However, In 1447, Francesco Sforza betrayed the Republic and was deprived of the residence.

In 1453 the Republic of Venice regained possession of the palace and sold it by auction to the Doge of the time, Francesco Foscari; he had the palace demolished and rebuilt in late Venetian gothic style; the building was chosen by the doge for its position on the Grand Canal. Foscari immediately set about rebuilding the palace in a manner befitting his status: he moved the site of the new palace forward on to the bank of the Grand Canal. Buying and rebuilding the palace for himself meant for the doge affirming his political and military role: he actually represented the continuity of the military successes of that period, lasted 30 years, and was the promoter of the Venetian expansion in the mainland (&quot;terraferma&quot;). The huge new palace could hardly have been finished when Foscari was disgraced in 1457 and retired to his new home until his death.

In 1574 king Henry III of France was housed in the second floor of the building.

The most recent restoration of Ca&#x27; Foscari and the adjacent Palazzo Giustinian was commissioned in 2004, aiming to fulfill the new requirements of safety and practicality. Work lasted from January 2004 until the summer of 2006.

Presently the palace is the headquarters of the Ca&#x27; Foscari University, which has made accessible to the public some of the most beautiful halls, such as the &quot;Aula Baratto&quot; and the &quot;Aula Berengo&quot;.

In 2013, thanks to a series of important technical measures for energy efficiency and thanks to the adoption of stringent environmental management practices put in place by the Ca&#x27; Foscari University, the building obtained the LEED certificate for sustainability, thus becoming the oldest building in the world to acquire this prestigious certification.

==Description==

Ca&#x27; Foscari is a typical example of the residence of the Venetian nobles and merchants. The structure is one of the most imposing buildings of the city and its external courtyard is the biggest courtyard of a private house after that of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. In common with other palaces, Ca&#x27; Foscari&#x27;s principal and most decorated facade and entrance faced the Grand Canal —- the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. This façade is characterized by a rhythmic sequence of arches and windows; this style, known as Floral Gothic, is emulated throughout the city and can be identified through the use of pointed arches and carved window heads. At Ca&#x27; Foscari, the tops of each column are decorated with carved quatrefoil patterns, whereas the Gothic capitals are adorned with foliage, animals and masks. Above the Gothic window is a marble frieze with a helmet surmounted by a lion couchant representing the role of the doge as the captain of the republic. At each side of the central helmet are two putti holding a shield symbolising the Foscari&#x27;s coat of arms with the winged lion of Saint Mark, symbol of Venice.

The practical function of Venetian palaces differed from those in other Italian cities. The nobility did not derive their income from landed estates as elsewhere, but from seafaring and trade. As a result, their &quot;fondaco&quot; houses had to serve not only as residences but also as the headquarters for their trading ventures. The main features of these early palaces were two-storey arcades or loggias along the waterfront; on the ground floor was a portal for loading and unloading merchandise. The portal often led into an entrance hall or &quot;portico&quot; used for business negotiations, with storerooms and offices on either side and a kitchen at the back. The living quarters were upstairs, with the rooms leading off great T-shaped central room. A well and an open staircase were placed in the courtyard. There were low towers at each end of the façade. The House of the two Towers too used to have this structure, before Francesco Foscari decided to destroy it and rebuild it in Gothic style.

The ground floor was used as storerooms; the first and second floors (&quot;piani nobili&quot;) were used for formal entertaining and private residential use, respectively. The central loggia of these two principal floors are designed in a similar Venetian floral Gothic style to the better known arcade of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The loggias, tied one above the other, are now glazed and light the large halls behind. The loggias are flanked by wings each of two bays containing smaller rooms.

==Uses of the building==

After the death of Francesco Foscari in 1457, the palace was used for various and different purposes, according to the epoch. Some dates for events and particular uses of the building:
*1513 The wedding party of Federico Foscari and the daughter of Giovanni Venier took place in the palace
*1516 the palace was divided between the heirs of the Foscari family and used to give hospitality to European kings calling at Venice.
*1661 the heirs of the Foscari family resumed possession of the palace and went to live there again, while renting part of the building to the Duke of Brunswick
*1698 Peter I of Russia, received hospitality in secrecy
*1790 Francesco Foscari (son of Sebastiano Foscari, not to be mistaken with the doge who gave the name to the palace) died: he was the last member of the family to live in the palace
*1811 amateur actors used the building as a theatre
*1835 the building was used by indigent citizens, painters (for the beautiful view on the Grand Canal) and shopkeepers (as storeroom for their stuff)
*1848 The palace was used as a barracks by the army of Daniele Manin
*1849 During the bombing of Venice by the Austrians the palace gave hospitality to poor families and afterwards used as a barracks by the Austrian army
*1868 the palace became the seat of the University Ca&#x27; Foscari of Venice

===The portal===
The portal of Ca&#x27; Foscari is today the main entrance of the building and was restored in 2008. It is made of Istrian marble, is of rectangular shape, it is surmounted by a lunette; on its perimeter it is decorated with chequered patterns. The coat of arms inside the lunette is composed of a central blazon and three putti (one on each side and one on the top); inside the blazon is depicted the winged lion of St. Mark holding an open book. In 1797, following the forced surrender of Venice and overthrow of the Republic by General Bonaparte, family blazons were abolished; consequently, they were hidden, taken down or, as at Ca&#x27; Foscari, covered with whitewash.

===Entrance hall===
The entrance hall was restored in 1936 by the great Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. On that occasion Scarpa designed:
*the glass wall entrance, which reminds the window of the great hall on the second floor
*the benches (with the typical T-shape pattern present in other works by Carlo Scarpa)
*the handrail of the nineteenth-century stairway
*the lamps

===Mario Baratto Hall===
The great hall dedicated to Mario Baratto (a professor of Italian literature and antifascist, who died in 1984) is situated on the second floor (the piano nobile) of the palace. The room is used today for conferences, conventions, formal ceremonies, advanced training courses and important events of Ca’ Foscari University. Scarpa designed the Great Hall in order to replace the Museum of Commerce. A massive portal with the Latin inscription ″STUDIA DECUS ORNAMENTUMQUE VITAE″ introduces the hall.

The most relevant features of the rooms are represented by:
*the interventions made by Carlo Scarpa (the window, the boiserie and the footboard);
*the two frescos painted by Mario Sironi e Mario De Luigi, which date back to 1936-1937;
*the view on the largest bend of the Grand Canal.

In 1979 a fire destroyed part of the room and consequently the architect Valeriano Pastor restored the room and the boiserie. After the fire the boiserie of Scarpa was in a very deteriorated state. Valeriano Pastor, student of Scarpa, restored it together with the same craftsman that worked with Scarpa in 1956.

Between 1935 and 1937 Mario Sironi was asked by the rector Agostino Lanzillo to decorate the Great Hall of Ca’ Foscari. He was chosen because he was considered an artist able to convey the faith and the fervor of the Italian Fascist youth of that period. The &quot;Italy, Venice and Studies&quot; fresco includes a student athlete holding a book and a musquet, the allegory of Technique, the allegory of Medicine, the city of Venice sitting on a throne, the lion of St. Mark and the domes of the basilica. It also shows a figure in chains called Motherland, which represents the victory of Italy in Ethiopia. There is an inscription over the Motherland figure: “Italy will do by itself”; it refers to the autarky pursued by Italy and to its ambition to become an imperial power. The second painting represents the school of philosophers. In the middle there is the thinker surrounded by his students. The painting presents traces of cubism, but there is also the three-dimensional element. The painting recalls Pablo Picasso&#x27;s and Juan Gris&#x27;s artistic style and Georges Braque&#x27;s emphasis on colors.

In 2004 the room was restored once more, this time as part of the general restoration of the entire building. The craftsmen who had worked with Carlo Scarpa were called upon for the restoration of the boiserie and it was on this occasion that the chairs now present in the room were made.

===Interventions by Carlo Scarpa===
In 1936 Carlo Scarpa restored and remodeled various parts of the university, including the great hall.

In 1956 Scarpa was asked to return to Ca&#x27; Foscari to transform the great hall into a lecture hall, and on this occasion he created the boiserie elements. Before the intervention of the architect, the space now occupied by the great hall was used to house a museum of the Faculty of Economics.

Scarpa&#x27;s project for the great hall included:

* the window frame (made of glass and wood) in front of the 15th-century gothic window (polifora)
* the wooden platform with the slab of marble with a Latin inscription and the two pedestals
* the wooden tribune
* the marble portal with a Latin inscription

Scarpa removed the student tribune and designed the boiserie panelling, using part of the same wood employed for the student gallery. The boiserie is both a connection and a separation between the room and the corridor. Its sliding cloth-covered frames are used to conceal the room, and when they&#x27;re closed they remind the ogive of the gothic window. The image of the gothic window is mirrored on the glass of the boiserie, with notable light effects.

===Frescoes===

====&quot;Venezia, l&#x27;Italia e gli Studi&quot;, by Mario Sironi====
Mario Sironi was commissioned to decorate the great hall Mario Baratto in 1936.
The painting portrays a series of allegorical figures:
*the student athlete (emblem of the Fascist University Groups) holding a book and a musket;
*the winged lion emblem of the Republic of Venice;
*the domes of the St Mark&#x27;s Basilica;
*the allegory of Technique (the woman leaning against a wheel);
*the allegory of Medicine (the woman with the caduceus);
*Venice (the woman on the throne holding a plate depicting Ca&#x27; Foscari);
*the Homeland (which represents the victory of Italy against Ethiopia).

====&quot;La scuola&quot;, by Mario De Luigi====
Mario De Luigi was a close friend of Carlo Scarpa; they both attended the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice and they worked together in the field of design and town planning; he was assistant of Arturo Martini at the Academy, then he started teaching scenography at University IUAV of Venice. De Luigi was asked to decorate a room on the first floor of Ca&#x27; Foscari palace; afterwards the painting was moved to the second floor, in the great hall Mario Baratto. The painting portrays a philosopher among his students.

<text>Ottersum is a village in the Dutch province of Limburg. It is a part of the municipality of Gennep, and lies about 17 km southeast of Nijmegen.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1349-1362 as Dragondeez, and means &quot;house of Dragon (person)&quot;. Ottersum developed along the Niers in the Early Middle Ages. It used to be part of the Duchy of Cleves and in 1815 became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The Catholic John the Baptist Church is a three-aisled basilica-like church which was built between 1930 and 1931. The former monastery Maria Roepaan was built by the Sisters of Divine Providence from Münster during the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. A school and orphanage were added to complex. The building was damaged in 1945, and restored in 1949. Since 1995, it used for corporate events.

Ottersum was home to 200 people in 1840. In 1944 and 1945, the village was damaged by war. It was a separate municipality until 1973, when it was merged with Gennep.

<text>Starburst (originally known as Opal Fruits) is the brand name of a box-shaped, fruit-flavoured soft taffy candy manufactured by The Wrigley Company, which is a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated. Starburst has many different varieties, such as Tropical, Sour, FaveREDs, Watermelon, Very Berry, Superfruit, Summer Blast and Original.

Introduced in the United Kingdom in 1959, the regular flavours are blackcurrant, lemon and lime, orange and strawberry.

==History==
The brand was introduced by Mars in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 1959, named Opal Fruits by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5. Produced at their factory in Slough, Berkshire, the four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967 as M&amp;M&#x27;s Fruit Chewies. By 1968, they were renamed Starburst under the suggestion of Mars food scientist Aaron L. Brody, who noted M&amp;M&#x27;s connotation to chocolate. Brody&#x27;s team originally wanted to use fruit on the packaging but this was rejected as real fruit was not used. While the etymology of the name Starburst is not certain, it was probably an attempt to express the burst of flavour at each bite, and draw attention while space interest was at its peak during the Space Race. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits, though the lime flavour was replaced by cherry in the US in the early 1980s. Subsequently, its first variant, &quot;Sunshine Flavors&quot;, was released, and was later renamed &quot;Tropical Opal Fruits&quot;. In Europe, the lemon and lime flavours were combined to become a singular &quot;lemon and lime&quot; flavour to make room for a blackcurrant flavour.
The brand name &quot;Opal Fruits&quot; was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardise the product in a globalised marketplace. In 2008, however, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting on 10 May 2008. On 6 October 2008, Mars acquired Wrigley and it transferred Mars&#x27; non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary. The original flavours are now branded &quot;Original Fruits&quot;, and Starburst now comes in several assortments: FaveREDs, Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries and Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavours are Strawberry Lemonade, Strawberry-Banana, Blue Raspberry, Blue Raspberry Rush, Cherry Splash, Citrus Slush, Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Passion Fruit, Mango, Blueberry, Blackberry, Raspberry, Melon, Watermelon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Orange Cream, Mixed Berries and Cream, Peaches and Cream and Strawberry and Cream. Europe and the United States also has the &quot;Sour&quot; assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix.

Starburst in the UK is vegetarian, its packaging and website clearly stating &quot;Suitable for Vegetarians&quot;, and also does not contain any artificial colours or flavours. In the US, Starburst contains non-vegan gelatin in its ingredients.

Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited-edition &quot;retro&quot; flavour in packages of the &quot;Baja&quot; version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line &quot;The chews that ooze.&quot; Each packet contains three flavours; Orange &amp; Mango, Raspberry &amp; Orange and Pineapple &amp; Orange.
As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is &quot;Unexplainably Juicy&quot;.

During March 2020, the Opal Fruits name was revived again for a limited period in the UK with a 152g bag available in Poundland and Dealz stores initially, which included the four original flavours (lemon, strawberry, orange, lime).

Starburst products were entirely discontinued in New Zealand in April 2021, and in Australia in June 2022. Starburst-branded products had been sold in Australia since 1996.

The European Union&#x27;s top food regulators found in 2021 that titanium dioxide, an additive found in Starbursts, could damage DNA, which in turn could lead to cancer. This resulted in the EU phasing out sale of Starbursts and other foods containing titanium dioxide starting February 7, 2022, with a full ban enacted August 7, 2022.

As of November 2022, the Duos and Tropical flavors have been discontinued by Mars Inc.

In March 2023, Democratic California Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel introduced the California Food Safety Act to the California Assembly which intended to ban production, sales, and consumption of all foods and drinks (including Starburst, Skittles, Pez, Sour Patch Kids, Campbell Soup, etc.) that contain titanium dioxide and 4 other harmful additives (propylparaben, red dye 3, brominated vegetable oil, and potassium bromate) across the state. All five of additives had been linked to causing cancer and other health problems and at least three were already banned by the European Union from being used in food and drink products. If passed, California will become the first US state to adopt the European Union&#x27;s ban on titanium dioxide and other cancer-causing chemical additives from being used in food and drink products. Although the legislation was signed into law in October 2023, a last-minute amendment removed titanium dioxide from the banned ingredients.

==Marketing==
In the 1970s, Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line &quot;Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!&quot; (slogan coined by Murray Walker). The full advertising jingle was &quot;Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!&quot;

Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch.

In 2002, Starburst created a song for the Australian market called &quot;Get Your Juices Going&quot;. It was released as a CD single and attributed to a fictional pop group also called Starburst.

In 2007, a commercial for Starburst&#x27;s Berries and Creme flavour went viral. The commercial, referred to as &quot;Berries and Creme&quot; or as &quot;The Little Lad Dance&quot;, stars a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy&#x27;s flavour by performing an impromptu song and dance routine. The commercial received praise for its style from &quot;Advertising Age&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Adweek&quot; the actor of the character (Jack Ferver) commented that the commercial took over 12 hours to film and that they had to wear the full costume in weather.

In the second half of 2021, the Berries and Creme commercial went viral for a second time, with a number of videos on TikTok using the audio and the &quot;Little Lad Dance&quot;.

==Other varieties==
Starburst also exists or has existed in the form of vines &quot;fruit twists&quot;, ropes, candy corn, popsicles, gum, candy canes, jelly beans, fruit roll ups, gelatin, energy drinks (in partnership with C4 Energy), lip gloss (in a partnership with Lip Smackers) and yogurt (by Yoplait in 2019 as a flavour). Until 2021, the company also produced &#x27;heart-shaped&#x27; jelly beans for Valentine&#x27;s Day. In 2021, Starburst released their first vegan gummy candy in the US.

A range of non-taffy Starburst products for the Australian and New Zealand markets were produced from 1997 to 2020; products included &#x27;Snakes&#x27; gummies and &#x27;Sucks&#x27; lollipops.

<text>Skazi is an Israeli EDM project formed in 1998, by Asher Swissa.

==History==
Skazi was formed in 1998 by Asher Swissa and Assaf Bivas, producing Soft Psy-Trance Electro Punk music.

Swissa began his musical career as a punk rocker in 1990, when he formed a group called Sartan Hashad (en. Breast Cancer) together with three friends. The band played in small venues in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and enjoyed limited success in the Israeli punk scene. In 1996 Asher left the band to develop his career and to write and perform music which would appeal to larger audiences. He started making trance music, but still kept a hard rock sound, playing electric guitar riffs in many of his tracks. In 1998 he adopted the stage name DJ Skazi. Swissa is also a former member of WARRIORS, a musical group in collaboration with DJ MR.BLACK and which published one EP, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of 138!?&quot;, with Armada Music. In more recent years, Skazi is at times referred to with his real name, Asher Swissa, often stylised as ASHER SWISSA.

Skazi, with four other Israeli DJs, performed a set during a memorial on 28 November 2023, at the site of the Re&#x27;im music festival massacre, where 364 concertgoers were killed and 36 taken hostage by Hamas.

==Recording career==
Skazi&#x27;s first album, &quot;Animal&quot;, was released in September 2000. On this album Skazi combined live guitar riffs and techy hardcore sounds. While the music meshed with other Psy-Trance, it shared elements of Hard House and Techno record label, Chemical Crew.

Skazi produced four compilations between the years 2001 and 2004 (&quot;Zoo1&quot;, &quot;Zoo2&quot;, &quot;Zoo3&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted&quot;). Skazi has also been involved in collaborations with other artists.

<text>Bakel is a village east of Helmond and Eindhoven in southern part of the Netherlands. The total population is approximately 5,000. Until 1997, it formed the municipality of Bakel and Milheeze together with Milheeze. In 1997 Bakel merged with the Gemert municipality.

Bakel does not have old buildings, with the exception of the 16th century St Willibrordus Church which is the oldest in the area. This church was modernized during the 1970s, but regained some of the original style of decoration during the 1990s.

The area surrounding Bakel is heavily forested; the agricultural economy is dominated by the bio industry. It has the highest pig density in the Netherlands.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 715 as Bagoloso, which means &quot;open forest on a ridge&quot;.

The St Willibrordus Church, built in the 16th century, was severely damaged by fire in 1708, and largely rebuilt in 1721.

Bakel was home to 277 people in 1840.

<text>A starburst region is a region of space that is undergoing a large amount of star formation. A starburst is an astrophysical process that involves star formation occurring at a rate that is large compared to the rate that is typically observed. This starburst activity will consume the available interstellar gas supply over a timespan that is much shorter than the lifetime of the galaxy. For example, the nebula NGC 6334 has a star formation rate estimated to be 3600 solar masses per million years compared to the star formation rate of the entire Milky Way of about seven million solar masses per million years. Due to the high amount of star formation a starburst is usually accompanied by much higher gas pressure and a larger ratio of hydrogen cyanide to carbon monoxide emission-lines than are usually observed.

Starbursts can occur in entire galaxies or just regions of space. For example, the Tarantula Nebula is a nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud which has one of the highest star formation rates in the Local Group. By contrast, a starburst galaxy is an entire galaxy that is experiencing a very high star formation rate. One notable example is Messier 82 in which the gas pressure is 100 times greater than in the local neighborhood, and it is forming stars at about the same rate as the entire Milky Way in a region only about across. At this rate M82 will consume its 200 million solar masses of atomic and molecular hydrogen in 100 million years (its free-fall time).

Starburst regions can occur in different shapes, for example in Messier 94 the inner ring is a starburst region. Messier 82 has a starburst core of about 600 parsec in diameter. Starbursts are common during galaxy mergers such as the Antennae Galaxies. In the case of mergers, the starburst can either be local or galaxy-wide depending on the galaxies and how they are merging.

<doc id="996955" wikidata="Q5073759" url="?curid=996955" title="Characteristic energy">
<text>In astrodynamics, the characteristic energy (formula_1) is a measure of the excess specific energy over that required to just barely escape from a massive body. The units are length2 time−2, i.e. velocity squared, or energy per mass.

Every object in a 2-body ballistic trajectory has a constant specific orbital energy formula_2 equal to the sum of its specific kinetic and specific potential energy:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the standard gravitational parameter of the massive body with mass formula_5, and formula_6 is the radial distance from its center. As an object in an escape trajectory moves outward, its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy (which is always negative) increases, maintaining a constant sum.

Note that &quot;C&quot;3 is &quot;twice&quot; the specific orbital energy formula_2 of the escaping object.

==Non-escape trajectory==
A spacecraft with insufficient energy to escape will remain in a closed orbit (unless it intersects the central body), with
formula_8
where
*formula_4 is the standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_10 is the semi-major axis of the orbit&#x27;s ellipse.

If the orbit is circular, of radius &quot;r&quot;, then
formula_11

==Parabolic trajectory==
A spacecraft leaving the central body on a parabolic trajectory has exactly the energy needed to escape and no more:
formula_12

==Hyperbolic trajectory==
A spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a hyperbolic trajectory has more than enough energy to escape:
formula_13
where
*formula_4 is the standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_10 is the semi-major axis of the orbit&#x27;s hyperbola (which may be negative in some convention).

Also,
formula_16
where formula_17 is the asymptotic velocity at infinite distance. Spacecraft&#x27;s velocity approaches formula_17 as it is further away from the central object&#x27;s gravity.

==History of the notation==
According to Chauncey Uphoff, the ultimate source of the notation &quot;C3&quot; is Forest Ray Moulton&#x27;s textbook &quot;An Introduction to Celestial Mechanics&quot;. In the second edition (1914) of this book, Moulton solves the problem of the motion of two bodies under an attractive gravitational force in chapter 5. After reducing the problem to the relative motion of the bodies in the plane, he defines the constant of the motion &quot;c3&quot; by the equation 
::&quot;ẋ2 + ẏ2 = 2k2 M/r + c3&quot;, 
where &quot;M&quot; is the total mass of the two bodies and &quot;k2&quot; is Moulton&#x27;s notation for the gravitational constant. He defines &quot;c1&quot;, &quot;c2&quot;, and &quot;c4&quot; to be other constants of the motion. The notation &quot;C3&quot; probably became popularized via the JPL technical report TR-32-30 (&quot;Design of Lunar and Interplanetary Ascent Trajectories&quot;, Victor C. Clarke, Jr., March 15, 1962), which used Moulton&#x27;s terminology.

==Examples==
MAVEN, a Mars-bound spacecraft, was launched into a trajectory with a characteristic energy of 12.2 km2/s2 with respect to the Earth. When simplified to a two-body problem, this would mean the MAVEN escaped Earth on a hyperbolic trajectory slowly decreasing its speed towards formula_19. However, since the Sun&#x27;s gravitational field is much stronger than Earth&#x27;s, the two-body solution is insufficient. The characteristic energy with respect to Sun was negative, and MAVEN – instead of heading to infinity – entered an elliptical orbit around the Sun. But the maximal velocity on the new orbit could be approximated to 33.5 km/s by assuming that it reached practical &quot;infinity&quot; at 3.5 km/s and that such Earth-bound &quot;infinity&quot; also moves with Earth&#x27;s orbital velocity of about 30 km/s.

The InSight mission to Mars launched with a C3 of 8.19 km2/s2. The Parker Solar Probe (via Venus) plans a maximum C3 of 154 km2/s2.

Typical ballistic C3 (km2/s2) to get from Earth to various planets: Mars 8-16, Jupiter 80, Saturn or Uranus 147. To Pluto (with its orbital inclination) needs about 160–164 km2/s2.

<text>A starburst is graphic design or typographical element that resembles diverging rays of light or consists of a star-like image with rays emanating from it. One is notably used as the current logo of the American retailer Walmart.

In Unicode, there are various star and asterisk symbols. The ones most commonly associated with the idea of a starburst are the &quot;sixteen pointed asterisk&quot; U+273A (✺) and the &quot;combining Cyrillic millions&quot; character U+0489 (  ҉ ).

<doc id="996964" wikidata="Q152596" url="?curid=996964" title="Pacifier">
<text>A pacifier is a rubber, plastic, or silicone nipple substitute given to an infant or toddler to suckle on between feedings to quiet their distress by satisfying the need to suck when they do not need to eat. Pacifiers normally have three parts: an elongated teat, a handle, and a mouth shield that prevents the child from swallowing or choking on it.

Pacifiers have many informal names: &quot;binky&quot; or &quot;nookie&quot; (American English), &quot;dummy&quot; (Australian and British English), &quot;dokey&quot; (informal Scots), &quot;soother&quot; (Canadian English), and &quot;dodie&quot; (Hiberno-English).

==History==
In England in the 17th–19th centuries, a &quot;coral&quot; was a teething toy made of coral, ivory or bone, often mounted in silver as the handle of a rattle. A museum curator has suggested that these substances were used as &quot;sympathetic magic&quot; and that the animal bone could symbolize animal strength to help the child cope with pain.

Pacifiers were a development of hard teething rings, but they were also a substitute for the softer &quot;sugar tits&quot;, &quot;sugar-teats&quot;, or &quot;sugar-rags&quot; which had been in use in 19th century America. A writer in 1873 described a &quot;sugar-teat&quot; made from &quot;a small piece of old linen&quot; with a &quot;spoonful of rather sandy sugar in the center of it&quot;, &quot;gathered ... up into a little ball&quot; with a thread tied tightly around it. Rags with foodstuffs tied inside were also given to babies in many parts of Northern Europe and elsewhere. In some places a lump of meat or fat was tied in cloth, and sometimes the rag was moistened with brandy. German-speaking areas might use , cloth wrapped around sweetened bread or poppy-seeds.

A Madonna and child painted by Dürer in 1506 shows one of these tied-cloth &quot;pacifiers&quot; in the baby&#x27;s hand.

Pacifiers were settling into their modern form around 1900 when the first teat, shield and handle design was patented in the US as a &quot;baby comforter&quot; by Manhattan pharmacist Christian W. Meinecke. Rubber had been used in flexible teethers sold as &quot;elastic gum rings&quot; for British babies in the mid-19th century, and also used for feeding-bottle teats. In 1902, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. advertised a &quot;new style rubber teething ring, with one hard and one soft nipple&quot;. In 1909, someone calling herself &quot;Auntie Pacifier&quot; wrote to the &quot;New York Times&quot; to warn of the &quot;menace to health&quot; (she meant dental health) of &quot;the persistent, and, among poorer classes, the universal sucking of a rubber nipple sold as a &#x27;pacifier. In England too, dummies were seen as something the poorer classes would use, and associated with poor hygiene. In 1914, a London doctor complained about &quot;the dummy teat&quot;: &quot;If it falls on the floor it is rubbed momentarily on the mother&#x27;s blouse or apron, lipped by the mother and replaced in the baby&#x27;s mouth.&quot;

Early pacifiers were manufactured with a choice of black, maroon or white rubber, though the white rubber of the day contained a certain amount of lead. &quot;Binky&quot; (with a &quot;y&quot;) was first used in about 1935 as a trademarked brand name for pacifiers and other baby products manufactured by the Binky Baby Products Company of New York. The brand trademark is owned by Playtex in the U.S. (and other countries).

==Drawbacks==
There are negative effects from using a pacifier during breastfeeding for healthy babies. The AAP suggests avoiding pacifiers for the first month. Introducing a pacifier can lead to the infant ineffectively sucking at the breast and causing &quot;nipple confusion&quot;. Babies will take their suck out on the pacifier instead of nursing or comfort nursing at the breast which is good for the mother&#x27;s supply. Evidence in premature infants or infants that are not healthy is lacking but shows that it can have benefits. It may have clinical benefits for preterm babies, such as helping them progress from tube to bottle feeding.

Infants who use pacifiers may have more ear infections (otitis media). The effectiveness of avoiding the use of a pacifier to prevent ear infections is not known.

Although it is commonly believed that using a pacifier will lead to dental problems, it does not appear to lead to long-term damage if used for less than around three years. However, prolonged use of a pacifier or other non-nutritive sucking habit (such as finger or blanket sucking) has been found to lead to malocclusion of the teeth, that is teeth sticking out or not meeting properly when they bite together. This is a common problem and the dental (orthodontic) treatment to correct it can take a long time and can be expensive. A Cochrane Review of the evidence found that orthodontic braces or psychological intervention (such as positive or negative reinforcement) were effective in helping children stop sucking habits where that was necessary. An orthodontic brace that used a palatal crib design seems to have been more effective than a palatal arch design.

There appears to be no strong evidence that using a pacifier delays speech development by preventing babies from practicing their speaking skills.

==Benefits==
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry&#x27;s (AAPD) policy on pacifier use in the first months of life is to support the parental decision. Pacifier use is associated with a lower risk of developing a habit of finger sucking. The messaging from the AAPD is that prolonged use of a pacifier after 1 year of age can increase the risk of otitis media and use of a pacifier after 1.5 years (18 months) can have a negative effect on the development of the baby&#x27;s orofacial complex that can lead to bite and cross bite problems. 

There is some evidence that pacifiers can decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The researchers are divided over whether this association is sufficient reason to prefer pacifier use. Some argue that pacifiers should be recommended on the strength of an association, just as back sleeping was recommended on the strength of an association. Others argue that the association is not strong enough or that the mechanism is unclear.

Pacifiers can help premature infants as they develop their reflexes including the sucking reflex. 

Pacifiers can also provide comfort and some amount of pain-reliever effect if an infants requires a minor procedure. Pacifiers have also been found to reduce infants&#x27; crying during painful procedures such as venipuncture.

Researchers in Brazil have shown that neither &quot;orthodontic&quot; nor standard pacifiers prevent dental problems if children continue sucking past the age of three years.

It is commonly reported anecdotally that pacifier use among stimulant users helps reduce bruxism and thus prevents tooth damage. It is also known to help infants and toddlers to get to sleep and also keeps infants and toddlers calm.

==Medical policies==
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry&#x27;s &quot;Policy on Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits&quot; says: &quot;Most children stop sucking on thumbs, pacifiers or other objects on their own between 2 and 4 years of age. However, some children continue these habits over long periods of time. In these children, the upper front teeth may tip toward the lip or not come in properly. Frequent or intense habits over a prolonged period of time can affect the way the child&#x27;s teeth bite together, as well as the growth of the jaws and bones that support the teeth.&quot;

A study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) states that &quot;It seems appropriate to stop discouraging the use of pacifiers.&quot; The authors recommend the use of pacifiers at nap time and bedtime throughout the first year of life. For breastfeeding mothers, the authors suggest waiting until breastfeeding is well established, typically for several weeks, before introducing the pacifier.

The British Oral Health Foundation recommends: &quot;If you can, avoid using a dummy, soother or pacifier and discourage thumb sucking. These can both eventually cause problems with how the teeth grow and develop. And this may need treatment with a brace when the child gets older.&quot;

==Prevalence of attachments to pacifiers and their psychological functions==

In the late 1960s researchers dispelled the notion that pacifiers were psychologically unhealthy and aberrant. Richard H. Passman and Jane S. Halonen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee traced the developmental course of attachments to pacifiers and provided norms. They found that 66% of their sample of babies who were three months old in the United States demonstrated at least some attachment, according to their mothers. At six months of age, this incidence was 40%, and at nine months it was 44%. Thereafter, the rate of attachment to pacifiers dropped precipitously until, at 24 months of age and later, it was quite rare.

These researchers also provided experimental support for what were then only anecdotal observations that pacifiers do indeed pacify babies. In an unfamiliar playroom, one-year-old toddlers accompanied by their pacifier evidenced more play and demonstrated less distress than did babies without them. The investigators concluded that pacifiers should be considered to be attachment objects, similar to other security objects like blankets.

Passman and Halonen contended that the widespread occurrence of attachments to pacifiers as well as their importance as security objects should reassure parents that they are a normal part of development for a majority of infants and toddlers.

<doc id="996965" wikidata="Q463684" url="?curid=996965" title="American Center for Law &amp; Justice">
<text>The American Center for Law &amp; Justice (ACLJ) is a politically conservative, Christian-based legal organization in the United States. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and associated with Regent University School of Law in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

The ACLJ was founded in 1990 by law school graduate and evangelical minister Pat Robertson with the stated &quot;mandate to protect religious and constitutional freedoms&quot;. ACLJ generally pursues constitutional issues and conservative Christian ideals in courts of law. The leaders of the ACLJ also occasionally engage in public debates to present their perspective on legal and constitutional issues.

The ACLJ is described as being &quot;committed to ensuring the ongoing viability of freedom and liberty in the United States and around the world&quot; by &quot;focusing on U.S. constitutional law, European Union law and human rights law&quot; to protect &quot;universal, God-given and inalienable rights,&quot; according to Charity Navigator, which also issued a &quot;Low Concern&quot; advisory for the District of Columbia branch and a &quot;Moderate Concern&quot; for the Virginia Beach branch about the group after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that ACLJ has paid Donald Trump&#x27;s personal attorney Jay Sekulow and his family millions of dollars.

==History==

The ACLJ arose in part as a right-leaning political answer to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has a different interpretation of First Amendment protection of religious rights. The name and acronym, ACLJ, were chosen to contrast with the ACLU.
It has attracted much media attention for its lawsuits, such as its campaign to oppose changes to the constitution of Kenya that, according to the group, would permit abortion and Islamic law, and its attempts to block the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the former site of the World Trade Center. The ACLJ supported blocking the construction of the center through New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission.

In November 2010, the ACLJ asked that the U.S. Justice Department investigate the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association&#x27;s weekly prayer session on Capitol Hill, alleging that the organization demonstrated &quot;a pattern of inviting Islamic extremists with ties to terrorism to participate in these events&quot;.

In 2018, ACLJ attorney Jay Sekulow was on President Donald Trump&#x27;s personal legal team. Another Sekulow client at the time was the American Christian pastor Andrew Brunson, in detention and facing charges in Turkey.

The ACLJ is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

==Donations==
Since 2011, donations to ACLJ are routed through Sekulow&#x27;s family-run &quot;Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism&quot; (CASE), and many &quot;transactions that benefit members of the Sekulow family are disclosed on the CASE returns, but not the ACLJ&#x27;s.&quot; ACLJ&#x27;s and CASE&#x27;s tax returns show that between 1998 and 2011 they paid more than $33 million to Sekulow, members of his family, and businesses owned or co-owned by them. from 2011 to 2015, the two charities paid $5.5 million to Sekulow and members of his family, and $23 million to their businesses.

Sekulow is half-owner of the for-profit corporation Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group whose governor and executive officer is Stuart Roth, one of his partners in the law firm and real estate business that declared bankruptcy in 1986. From 2011 to 2016, the ACLJ paid the group $23 million, &quot;its largest outside expense.&quot;

==Europe==
In 1997 Jay Sekulow and Thomas Patrick Monaghan, chief counsel and senior counsel of the ACLJ, respectively, set up the European Center for Law and Justice (ECLJ) in Strasbourg as part of the ACLJ&#x27;s international strategy. Sekulow is chief counsel for the ECLJ. The following year the ACLJ set up the Slavic Center for Law and Justice (SCLJ) in Moscow. Both organizations on the European mainland have a full-time staff of religious rights attorneys. The ECLJ is active in the United Nations Organization and in the Council of Europe, and represents the interests of some Christians in the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

==Africa==
The ACLJ is one of several American Christian groups that are promoting conservative Christian laws in Africa, supporting controversial movements regarding LGBT rights, including support in Uganda for criminalizing homosexuality.

==Criticism==
The ACLJ has been criticized by the ACLU for its stance on putting prayer in public school, and by Americans United for conflating support of separation of church and state with being anti-religious. The Human Rights Campaign is critical of the ACLJ&#x27;s finances citing that the organization does not meet &quot;10 out of 20 of the Better Business Bureau’s standards for charity accountability&quot; and that ACLJ obfuscates how much Sekulow earns from the organization.

<doc id="996968" wikidata="Q1823297" url="?curid=996968" title="Sound Loaded">
<text>Sound Loaded is the sixth studio album by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin. It was released on November 14, 2000, by Columbia Records. Following the huge success of his first English album, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1999), Martin returned to the studio to record its follow-up English album. He worked with producers Walter Afanasieff, Emilio Estefan, Draco Rosa, and Desmond Child to create the album. Musically, &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; consists of dance club tracks, pop songs, adult contemporary ballads, and mid-tempo Latin numbers. After the album&#x27;s release, Martin embarked on a North American promotional tour.

The album was supported by three singles. The lead single &quot;She Bangs&quot; topped the charts in seven countries and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The second single &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; was re-recorded along with American singer Christina Aguilera and became a number one and top five hit around the world. &quot;Loaded&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single and experienced moderate commercial success. &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its dance tracks. The album was a commercial success. It debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 318,000 copies. It also reached the top-five in Australia, Canada, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. It has received several certifications, including triple platinum in Canada and double platinum in the United States, and has sold over seven million copies worldwide.

==Background and recording==
Ricky Martin released his fifth studio album and English-language debut, &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; in 1999, which became his biggest commercial success, debuting at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling over 15 million copies worldwide. To further promote the album, he embarked on the worldwide Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour. While the Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour had not been concluded yet, Columbia Records asked Martin to return to the studio to record his sixth studio album. He later wrote about the request in &quot;Me&quot;, his official autobiography: &quot;Now, when I think about it, I realize I should have said no. &quot;Definitely no!&quot; It was too soon and I was not ready to fully immerse myself in the intense creative work needed to record a new album.&quot; He reflected on it as &quot;one of the worst decisions&quot; of his life and &quot;a very serious mistake&quot;. In October 2000, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; revealed the album&#x27;s title as &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;, mentioning that it is an English album set for release on November 14, 2000. During an interview with the CNN, Martin explained the idea behind the album&#x27;s title:

The singer worked on the album with several producers and songwriters, including Walter Afanasieff, Emilio Estefan, Draco Rosa, and Desmond Child, and recorded it in Miami. During an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; Martin explained: &quot;It might sound clichéd, but it was my dream team. It was a situation devoid of egos. It was all about creativity. Everyone was open to working toward the same goal, which was to make the best possible record.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Sound Loaded&quot; is a primarily English language album composed of 15 songs, consisting dance club tracks, pop songs, adult contemporary ballads, and mid-tempo Latin numbers. &quot;She Bangs&quot; is a dance song that features Latin and salsa music influences. The song&#x27;s instrumentation features &quot;powerful&quot; percussion, trumpet blasts, and tropical beats. Lyrically, it tells a &quot;tale of a wild woman who may be hard to let go and even harder to hold&quot;, which is &quot;a metaphor for the universe&quot;. The album also contains a Spanish-language version of &quot;She Bangs&quot;, which was recorded under the same title. &quot;Saint Tropez&quot; has Brazilian influences with a &quot;delectable&quot; 1980&#x27;s vibe, using a &quot;passionate&quot; trumpet solo. &quot;Come to Me&quot; is a pop love song and ballad, featuring elements of flamenco. It also has a Spanish version titled &quot;Ven A Mí&quot; (). On &quot;Loaded&quot;, Martin combines 1960&#x27;s pop and Latin music with &quot;hard rock vocal intonations&quot;. The album also contains a Spanish-language version of the song, titled &quot;Dame Más&quot; ().

&quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; is a mid-tempo pop song and power ballad, featuring elements of flamenco and Latin music. The track is a love song about &quot;heartbreak&quot; and &quot;longing&quot;, as well as &quot;love, lose, and hope&quot;. &quot;Amor&quot; () is a Latin-flavored Spanglish salsa and dance club song, with Cuban influences, that uses &quot;a percussion break, a truncated pop-rock guitar solo, and a lazy, lolling piano&quot;. A salsa track using a &quot;tip-top&quot; piano, &quot;Jezabel&quot; talks about a woman&#x27;s &quot;ruthless romantic ambitions&quot;. &quot;The Touch&quot; is a power ballad, while the gypsy-tinged &quot;One Night Man&quot; features elements of salsa and Arabic music. In the energetic &quot;Are You In It for Love&quot;, the singer suspects that his lover is &quot;in it for kicks, private jets and Armani / And when the ride&#x27;s over, will you even bother to call me?&quot;. &quot;If You Ever Saw Her&quot; is a fusion of pop-soul, glam rock, and urban contemporary music. The last track on the album, &quot;Cambia la Piel&quot; () is a Spanish song, &quot;marked by bleating horns, jagged electric guitar lines, and staccato counter-rhythms&quot;.

==Singles==
Columbia Records released &quot;She Bangs&quot; to radio stations in several countries on September 22, 2000, as the lead single from the album. Thereafter, the song was released to the singles markets in October. The track was commercially successful, reaching number one in Argentina, Chile, Hong Kong, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, and Uruguay, as well as the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. It was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Spanish-language version of &quot;She Bangs&quot; reached the summit of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart. &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; was re-recorded along with American singer Christina Aguilera in December 2000. The duet was released to radio stations in the United States, on January 16, 2001, as the second single from the album. The single peaked at number one in Hungary, New Zealand, Romania, Poland, and Croatia, as well as the top five in Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others. It was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. A Spanish-language solo version of the song, entitled &quot;Sólo Quiero Amarte&quot; (), was recorded by Martin and topped the Hot Latin Tracks chart.

Both &quot;She Bangs&quot; and &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; reached the top-15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and has been certified silver in the UK. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Loaded&quot;, was launched on April 17, 2001; it became a top-20 hit in Belgium, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 97 on the Hot 100. &quot;Cambia la Piel&quot; released as the only promotional single from &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; on October 15, 2001. Music videos were filmed for both English and Spanish versions of &quot;She Bangs&quot;, &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot;, &quot;Sólo Quiero Amarte&quot;, &quot;Loaded&quot;, and &quot;Dame Más&quot;. The Spanish-language visual for &quot;She Bangs&quot; won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Video of the Year at the 13th Lo Nuestro Awards, and the Best Clip of the Year — Latin at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards. &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; video won the award for Outstanding Music Video at the 2002 ALMA Awards.

==Marketing==
===Release===
&quot;Sound Loaded&quot; was released by Columbia Records on November 14, 2000. The American edition contains a Spanglish radio edit for &quot;She Bangs&quot;, titled &quot;She Bangs (Obadam&#x27;s Spanglish Radio Edit)&quot; in addition to the standard track list. The Latin American edition of &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; includes &quot;Sólo Quiero Amarte&quot;, while &quot;Are You In It For Love&quot; is not featured. Since Martin re-recorded &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; with Aguilera after the album&#x27;s original release, the duet was added to the album&#x27;s track list later. The collaboration was not released in a major commercially available single format in the United States, and consumers could purchase the song only with buying the album. Those who had already bought the album could download it from Martin&#x27;s website for free or mail a sticker from their copy of the album, receiving a free CD with the new version. In all regions, the re-issue used the same track list as the original and the duet was added as the second disc.

===Live performances===

To further promote &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;, Martin embarked on a North American promotional tour. The tour began on November 13, 2000, at the Irving Plaza in New York City, and concluded on February 26, 2001, at the Guvernment in Toronto, with five concerts throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. In addition to his tour, Martin performed singles from &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; on many television programs and award shows. He performed &quot;She Bangs&quot; at the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 43rd Annual TV Week Logie Awards, the &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Al Fin de Semana&quot;, and &quot;Otro Rollo&quot;. The singer performed &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; at the 28th Annual American Music Awards on January 8, 2001. Later that year, he and Aguilera gave live performances of their collaboration on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, the ITV&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and the 13th Annual World Music Awards. In the same year, Martin also performed &quot;Cambia la Piel&quot; at the Premios de la Música and &quot;Loaded&quot; at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. To promote the album&#x27;s material in the United Kingdom, he delivered performances of &quot;She Bangs&quot;, &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; (with Aguilera), and &quot;Loaded&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in November 2000, January 2001, and July 2001, respectively. In July 2001, Martin performed &quot;She Bangs&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot; at the Allsång på Skansen, becoming the first &quot;world-famous pop artist&quot; ever to perform at the show, while breaking the record of its highest-attendance show with drawing an audience of 15,000.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sound Loaded&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64 based on 6 reviews. Gary Graff from Wall of Sound gave it a positive review, saying it &quot;is indeed loaded with sound, from lush love ballads to full-on polyrhythmic explosions made explicitly for bon-bon shaking&quot; and all 15 tracks &quot;sound as polished and lively as they do&quot;. He highlighted &quot;Cambia la Piel&quot; as the album&#x27;s &quot;most interesting track&quot;, describing it as &quot;an edgy gem marked by bleating horns, jagged electric guitar lines, and staccato counter-rhythms&quot;. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Arion Berger called the album &quot;relentlessly likable and danceable&quot;, while introducing &quot;Loaded&quot; as the best track. An author of &quot;Billboard&quot; noted &quot;a smattering of well-crafted material&quot; in the album on which Martin is &quot;allowed to truly strut his vocal stuff&quot;, highlighting &quot;The Touch&quot; and &quot;Come To Me&quot; as &quot;lovely ballads&quot;. The critic thought that unlike &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;, there is &quot;less of an attempt to fall in line with trends&quot; and Martin trusted &quot;listeners to subscribe to more traditional pop sounds&quot;, which resulted in &quot;a more consistent recording&quot;. They also praised Martin&#x27;s &quot;special attention to his Latin roots by including a handful of solid Spanish-language tunes&quot; that made the set &quot;an album that offers a little something for everyone&quot;.

Charlotte Robinson from &quot;PopMatters&quot; mentioned &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; and &quot;The Touch&quot; as the &quot;lowlights&quot; of &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; and labeled them &quot;crummy ballads&quot;, while praising dance numbers such as &quot;She Bangs&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;, as well as mid-tempo tracks. She highlighted &quot;Amor&quot; as one of the best mid-tempo songs in the collection and described &quot;Cambia la Piel&quot; as fabulous, adding the fact that the latter &quot;prove once again that Martin is the only one of the stars of the &#x27;Latin explosion&#x27; who actually makes Latin-sounding music on a regular basis&quot;. Similarly, AllMusic&#x27;s Jose F. Promis called the album &quot;a lushly produced set&quot;, praising its Latin-flavored dance tracks, including &quot;Amor&quot;, &quot;Jezabel&quot;, &quot;Cambia La Piel&quot;, and &quot;If You Ever Saw Her&quot;, describing the last one as endearing. He also stated that &quot;She Bangs&quot; is arguably one of best songs of the 2000s. Nevertheless, he thought that the ballads &quot;tend to weigh the album down&quot;, introducing &quot;Come to Me&quot; and &quot;The Touch&quot; as &quot;unmemorable&quot; tracks.

===Accolades===
At the 7th Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; was nominated for Favorite Male Artist of the Year and Favorite Artist — Latino, but lost them to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000) and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; (2000), respectively. Subsequently, it won the award for Favorite Male Artist — Pop at the ceremony. The album was also among the winning albums as the ten best-selling foreign releases at the 2001 Hong Kong Top Sales Music Awards.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Sound Loaded&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 318,000 copies, according to data compiled by Nielsen SoundScan for the chart dated December 2, 2000, becoming Martin&#x27;s second top-five album on the list. It also debuted at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Internet Album Sales chart in the same week.

<text>Vuelve () is the fourth studio album by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin. Sony Discos and Columbia Records released it on February 12, 1998. Martin worked with producers KC Porter, Robi Draco Rosa, and Desmond Child to create the album. Following the worldwide success of the song &quot;María&quot; from his previous album, &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; () (1995), Martin returned to the studio and began recording material while on tour. &quot;Vuelve&quot; is a Latin record with Latin dance numbers and pop ballads. &quot;María&quot; caught the attention of FIFA, who asked Martin to write an anthem for the 1998 FIFA World Cup being held in France. Martin subsequently recorded &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, composed by Porter, Rosa, and Desmond Child for the World Cup.

Critics&#x27; reviews of the album were generally positive; they praised its uptempo tracks and its production, though some criticized it for containing too many ballads. Martin received several accolades, including the Best Latin Pop Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999. &quot;Vuelve&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart and peaked at number forty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Martin&#x27;s performance of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; on the Grammy Awards show was credited for boosting the album&#x27;s sales. Certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it sold more than 888,000 copies in the United States, standing as the 10th best-selling Latin album in the country. &quot;Vuelve&quot; reached number one in Norway, Portugal, and Spain, as well as the top 10 in seven other countries, including Australia and Italy. As of 2008, the album had sold over six million copies worldwide.

&quot;Vuelve&quot; spawned six singles: its title track, &quot;Vuelve&quot;, &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, &quot;La Bomba&quot;, &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot;, &quot;Por Arriba, Por Abajo&quot;, and &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot;. &quot;Vuelve&quot; and &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot; both reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs in the US while &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; became an international hit in both Europe and South America. For promotion, Martin embarked on the worldwide Vuelve tour performing in Asia, Australia, Europe, Mexico, South America, and the United States.

==Background and recording==

In 1995, Ricky Martin released his third studio album, &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot;. On it, he shifted from his traditional ballad-style compositions to a riskier fusion of music focused on traditional Latin sounds, epitomized by the song &quot;María&quot;. Taken aback by the starkly different musical style, his record label executives felt the song would ruin Martin&#x27;s career. Despite this, &quot;María&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s second single and became a breakthrough success, reaching number one in France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Turkey, and the whole of South America. As of 2014, &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; has sold over three million copies worldwide. &quot;María&quot; caught the attention of FIFA. They contacted Martin in the middle of his tour and asked him to write an anthem for the 1998 World Cup; Martin subsequently recorded &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; () composed by KC Porter, Desmond Child, and fellow ex-member of Menudo Robi Draco Rosa. According to the vice president of marketing at Sony Music Europe, Richard Ogden, FIFA chose Martin because he &quot;exemplified all of the ideals that organizers of the famed football (soccer) tournament wanted us to try to embody in music&quot;.

While on tour in 1997, Martin returned to the studio and began recording material for his fourth studio album. He said the experience of touring and recording at the same time was &quot;brutal and incredibly intense&quot;. On December 7, 1997, Martin confirmed he was completing his next project and that the album would be released in February of the following year. He worked on the album with producers Porter and Rosa, and recorded it in studios across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Spain. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Vuelve&quot;, was announced on January 25, 1998. In an interview with CNN en Español, he emphasized it was going to &quot;reaffirm the internationalization of my career and I know that it will help me a lot to destroy the stereotypes that may exist with my culture&quot;.

== Composition and lyrics ==

&quot;Vuelve&quot; is a Latin album composed of 14 songs, consisting mainly of &quot;red-hot&quot; Latin dance numbers and &quot;melodramatic&quot; pop ballads. The uptempo tracks &quot;Lola, Lola&quot; and &quot;La Bomba&quot; () mix the musical styles of salsa and rumba with jazz, rock, and pop. On &quot;Por Arriba, Por Abajo&quot; (), Martin asks the saints to have his love interest dance with him. It is a samba-influenced track, accompanied by African chants and &quot;wicked horn blasts&quot;. &quot;La Bomba&quot; is influenced by the Puerto Rican dance of the same name; its lyrics discuss how the singer gets drunk from the rhythm. The song features Cuban musician Paquito Hechavarría on the piano. &quot;Lola, Lola&quot; is an uptempo number, on which the singer sings about the women he desires. The title track, penned by Venezuelan singer-songwriter Franco De Vita, is a &quot;sultry&quot; love song with a gospel chorus and includes the narrator pleading with Martin&#x27;s love interest to return as she gives meaning to his life. In a 2007 interview with Estudio Billboard, De Vita recalled he had been writing the song for 10 years when Martin asked him to compose a track for the album. &quot;Corazonado&quot; () and &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot; () are ballads with &quot;aching, slower-paced narratives&quot;, with the latter track being a &quot;bedroom staple with a dreamy hook and a simmering feel&quot;. &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot; () is a bolero about an artist &quot;[o]bsessed with his own broken heart and threatening to die if his lover does not return&quot;. An instrumental version of the song was recorded for &quot;Vuelve&quot;, which serves as the closing track.

&quot;Hagamos el Amor&quot; () is an orchestrated ballad with a string arrangement and a &quot;brooding&quot; piano&quot;. &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, the official theme for the 1998 World Cup, is a samba song featuring various instruments including bells, whistles, horns, trumpets, and percussion. On the song, Martin declares life is a competition where one has to &quot;dream to be the champ&quot;. &quot;Así es la Vida&quot; () is as &quot;openly pop as it is romantic&quot; and includes a chorus in the background. Martin recorded two cover songs in Spanish for the album: &quot;Marcia Baila&quot; () and &quot;Gracias por Pensar en Mi&quot; (). Les Rita Mitsouko originally performed &quot;Marcia Baila&quot;, and was a success in France in the 1980s. &quot;Gracias por Pensar en Mi&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;A Via Lactea&quot; () by Legião Urbana from their album &quot;A Tempestade ou O Livro dos Dias&quot; (1996). Renato Russo had written it months before he died of AIDS. The narrator for &quot;Gracias por Pensar en Mi is a person close to dying. &quot;Vuelve&quot; also features the song &quot;No Importa la Distancia&quot;, the Spanish-language version of &quot;Go the Distance&quot; by Michael Bolton from the movie &quot;Hercules&quot;. It was released as a single for the Latin American edition of the &quot;Hercules&quot; soundtrack in 1997 and peaked at number 10 on the Latin Pop Airplay chart.

==Singles==
The title track was released as the album&#x27;s first single on January 26, 1998. It was his first number-one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart in the US. The song became a top five hit in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama, and on Mexico&#x27;s ballads chart. It reached number one in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela. The track was the theme song for the Mexican telenovela &quot;Sin ti&quot; (1997). &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; was released as the second single on March 9, 1998. The song grew to be an international success, appearing on the charts in more than 60 countries, and reaching number one in 30 countries, including Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), Costa Rica, El Salvador, France, Germany, Italy, Panama, Spain, Nicaragua, Sweden, Switzerland, Venezuela, as well as topping the European Hot 100 Singles chart. It peaked at number two in Norway, as well as on the ballads chart in Mexico, and the Hot Latin Songs chart in the US. The song has been ranked as the best World Cup anthem of all-time by multiple publications.

The third single from &quot;Vuelve&quot;, &quot;La Bomba&quot;, was released on June 16, 1998; it reached number five in Spain, number 27 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, and ranked on several charts in Europe and Australia. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot;, was released on August 18, 1998, and became Martin&#x27;s second number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart. &quot;Por Arriba, Por Abajo&quot;, was the fifth single to be released from &quot;Vuelve&quot; on November 3, 1998; it reached number 13 in Spain and number 33 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot;, was launched on December 21, 1998. &quot;Corazonado&quot; was released as a promotional single in the US and peaked at number 20 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Music videos were filmed for &quot;Vuelve&quot;, &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, &quot;La Bomba&quot;, &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot;, and &quot;Por Arriba, Por Abajo&quot;.

==Marketing==
===Release===
Sony Music released &quot;Vuelve&quot; in Puerto Rico on February 12, 1998. Martin was on hand for the album&#x27;s launch. It was released on the same day in the United States, February 24 in Spain, and the following month across the rest of Europe and Southeast Asia. To promote &quot;Vuelve&quot; in Asian markets, Sony Music Asia released a promo CD containing three versions of &quot;María&quot;, and &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; (the English-language version of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;). Sony Music Japan launched the album in the label&#x27;s native country on March 25, 1998, to coincide with Martin&#x27;s advertisement campaign for Suzuki. The European edition of &quot;Vuelve&quot; includes the Spanglish radio edit of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; while the Australian adds the radio edit of &quot;María&quot; as well; neither features the instrumental rendition of &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot;. The Japanese release includes the three aforementioned tracks. For the Asian market, the album includes two more remixes of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; in addition to a remix of &quot;La Bomba&quot;, the Spanglish rendition of &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot; and Martin&#x27;s previously-recorded songs &quot;Corazón&quot; (), &quot;Dónde Estarás&quot; (), and &quot;Te Extraño, Te Olvido, Te Amo&quot; (). Martin advertised &quot;Vuelve&quot; on &quot;Siempre en Domingo&quot; in Mexico and &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; in Australia.

===Live performances===
To further promote &quot;Vuelve&quot;, Martin embarked on the worldwide Vuelve Tour; he performed in Asia, Australia, Europe, Mexico, South America, and the United States. The day after releasing the album, Martin held two sold-out concerts at the 30,000-seat Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Puerto Rico on February 13 and 14, 1998, respectively. In South America, he performed in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. His shows in Venezuela and Peru were held as benefit concerts, the former as part of &quot;A Venezuela Without Drugs&quot; campaign, and the latter for the Foundation for Children of Peru . Martin also participated in the second annual &quot;Festival Presidente de Música Latino&quot; in the Dominican Republic on June 26, 1997, where he had top billing for the event. In Asia, he toured in India, China, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore. A concert was planned for Indonesia in May of the same year but was cancelled because of anti-government rioting. In the US, he performed at the Miami Arena in Miami, the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, and Madison Square Garden in New York. His sold-out performance at the Arrowhead Pond grossed over $446,805 which landed it at number 10 on the Boxscore chart on November 7, 1998. For this achievement, the concert&#x27;s promoter, the Nederlander Organization, presented Martin with the Estrella del Pond Award. His show at Madison Square Garden grossed $632,180 placing it second on the Boxscore chart of November 10.

A 14-piece band accompanied Martin during his tour, which included four backup vocalists alongside percussion and brass sections. His hour-and-45 minute show consisted of 17 tracks of uptempo numbers and ballads from &quot;Vuelve&quot; and his earlier career. Aside from the tour, Martin sang &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; live at the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final in France, on the halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys-New England Patriots football game at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and the 1999 Grammy Awards. &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s John Lannert criticized Martin&#x27;s presentation in Puerto Rico for the uneven number of slow-tempo and dance numbers as well as the awkward pauses when he changed outfits off-stage. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Ernesto Lechner felt that Martin &quot;showcased his slick, masterfully composed pop material&quot; at his show at the Arrowhead Pond but remarked that the singer &quot;might have served himself and his fans better by performing a handful of nights at a more intimate venue than the Pond&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Vuelve&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics with the uptempo tracks receiving with the most positive reactions. AllMusic&#x27;s Jose F. Promis complimented Martin over how it &quot;effectively balances&quot; dance tracks and ballads. He cited &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; as the main highlight but preferred the original version on the album to the English-language adaption. He also lauded the other dance numbers from the record. John Lannert of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine compared &quot;Vuelve&quot; to &quot;A Medio Vivir&quot; as a &quot;like-minded package of meaty, bitter-sweet romantic ballads and chest-pumping, upbeat numbers&quot;. He felt the uptempo songs had the potential to be a hit. Vilma Maldonado of &quot;The Monitor&quot; praised the record as &quot;creative history&quot; and its production as &quot;seamless&quot; and mentioned that &quot;La Copa de la Copa&quot; stands out the most. Writing for &quot;Vista&quot; magazine, Carmen Teresa Roiz described the record as a metamorphosis for Martin; she regarded it as the culmination of his music career in &quot;all his splendor&quot;.

In the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, Ramiro Burr remarked Martin &quot;took careful notes&quot; following the success of &quot;Maria&quot; as &quot;Vuelve&quot; &quot;continues in that same party fever vein but with more intensity&quot;. Burr complimented Porter for being able to maintain the &quot;right balance between the gorgeous R&amp;B drive of the horn and high-energy pop rhythms&quot; on the production and commented that the ballads &quot;serve only as breaks from dancing&quot;. David Wild of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; touted the record&#x27;s &quot;extremely polished and infectious Latin pop that&#x27;s immediately accessible even to dogged English-speaking types&quot;. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editor Leila Cobo wrote a positive review of &quot;Vuelve&quot;; she called the album a &quot;collection of &quot;baila&quot;-able tunes interspersed with catchy pop ballads and felt the arrangements make it &quot;stand above the often heavily synthesized Latin pop fray&quot;. For &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, Mario Tarradell complimented the singer for &quot;showing a refreshing flair for diversity&quot;. He regarded the dance tunes &quot;Lola, Lola&quot;, &quot;La Bomba&quot;, and &quot;Marcia Baila&quot; as the best tracks on the album.

Critics, however, were divided on the ballads. Promis found some of them forgettable, particularly on the second half of the record. Maldonado found the hook on the title track to be &quot;instant and unforgettable&quot; a sentiment shared by Roiz whereas Cobo criticized it as one of the weakest songs from the album and felt its choruses were &quot;irritating&quot; as they overshadowed Martin&#x27;s voice. Burr&#x27;s only complaint about &quot;Vuelve&quot; was the inclusion of &quot;No Importa la Distancia&quot;, describing it as &quot;sappy&quot; which Tarradell similarly expressed as an &quot;unwelcome dose of sugary pap&quot;. Tarradell also opined that the ballads &quot;fell into excess&quot; and called the instrumental version of &quot;Casi un Bolero&quot; an &quot;overkill&quot; although he praised &quot;Vuelve&quot; and &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Lechner commended Martin&#x27;s vocal ability on the album to &quot;handle both ballads and up-tempo tunes&quot; and cited the title track would make the album &quot;most likely survive the test of time&quot;. In addition, he admired &quot;Hagamos el Amor&quot; for its &quot;sly use of the orchestral passages, passionate delivery, and an overall mood that belongs only to an album by a real artist&quot; despite recognizing the title of the song. Richard Torres of &quot;Newsday&quot;, writing a positive review of &quot;Vuelve&quot;, was more receptive of the ballads. He complimented Martin&#x27;s &quot;soulful falsetto&quot; on &quot;Corazonado&quot;, the &quot;sweetness&quot; of &quot;Perdido Sin Ti&quot;, and the &quot;gospel-ish intensity&quot; on the title track.

===Accolades===
At the 10th Annual Lo Nuestro Awards in 1998, &quot;Vuelve&quot; received a nomination for Pop Album of the Year, but lost to &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot; by Alejandro Fernández. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999, Martin won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance for &quot;Vuelve&quot;. At the 1999 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, it won Pop Album of the Year by a Male Artist, and El Premio de la Gente for Male Pop Artist or Group and Album of the Year at the Ritmo Latino Music Awards in the same year. In 2015, the album was listed among &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 50 Essential Latin Albums of the 50 Past Years. An editor opined, &quot;Pop and dance beats never sounded so good.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;Vuelve&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums the week of February 28, 1998, succeeding &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot;. The album spent 26 weeks in this position. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Lannert credited its success on Valentine&#x27;s Day weekend sales. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Vuelve&quot; debuted at number 81. A year after its release, sales of &quot;Vuelve&quot; climbed after Martin&#x27;s performance of &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; at the Grammy Awards. The album ended 1998 as the second best-selling Latin album (after &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot;), and the best-selling Latin record the following year in the US. His rendition, along with anticipation of Martin&#x27;s first English-language album, helped the former to peak at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. According to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Vuelve&quot; has sold over 888,000 copies in the US, making it the 10th best-selling Latin album in the country .

The album also peaked at number one on the Portuguese Albums Chart, and received a platinum certification from Associação Fonográfica Portuguesa (AFP) denoting shipments of over 40,000 copies in Portugal. &quot;Vuelve&quot; debuted at number 34 on the Norwegian Albums Chart. In its fifth week on the chart, it peaked at number one and stayed on the top for three consecutive weeks.

In Sweden, &quot;Vuelve&quot; debuted at number 29 on the albums chart on April 10, 1998. After fluctuating on the chart for 17 weeks, on July 31, 1998, it reached its peak at number two.

<doc id="996973" wikidata="Q411752" url="?curid=996973" title="Magnesium fluoride">
<text>Magnesium fluoride is an ionically bonded inorganic compound with the formula . The compound is a colorless to white crystalline salt and is transparent over a wide range of wavelengths, with commercial uses in optics that are also used in space telescopes. It occurs naturally as the rare mineral sellaite.

==Production==
Magnesium fluoride is prepared from magnesium oxide with sources of hydrogen fluoride such as ammonium bifluoride, by the breakdown of it:
Related metathesis reactions are also feasible:

==Structure==
The compound crystallizes as tetragonal birefringent crystals. The structure of the magnesium fluoride is similar to that of rutile, featuring octahedral cations and 3-coordinate  anions.

In the gas phase, monomeric molecules adopt a linear molecular geometry.

==Uses==
===Optics===
Magnesium fluoride is transparent over an extremely wide range of wavelengths. Windows, lenses, and prisms made of this material can be used over the entire range of wavelengths from 0.120 μm (vacuum ultraviolet) to 8.0 μm (infrared). High-quality, synthetic magnesium fluoride is one of two materials (the other being lithium fluoride) that will transmit in the vacuum ultraviolet range at 121 nm (Lyman alpha). Lower-grade magnesium fluoride is inferior to calcium fluoride in the infrared range.

Magnesium fluoride is tough and polishes well but is slightly birefringent and should therefore be cut with the optic axis perpendicular to the plane of the window or lens. Due to its suitable refractive index of 1.37, magnesium fluoride is commonly applied in thin layers to the surfaces of optical elements as an inexpensive anti-reflective coating. Its Verdet constant is 0.00810arcmin⋅G−1⋅cm−1 at 632.8 nm.

== Safety ==
Chronic exposure to magnesium fluoride may affect the skeleton, kidneys, central nervous system, respiratory system, eyes and skin, and may cause or aggravate attacks of asthma.

<doc id="996974" wikidata="Q2604408" url="?curid=996974" title="Cornélie Falcon">
<text>Cornélie Falcon (28 January 1814 – 25 February 1897) was a French dramatic soprano who sang at the Opéra in Paris. Her greatest success was creating the role of Valentine in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. She possessed &quot;a full, resonant voice&quot; with a distinctive dark timbre and was an exceptional actress. Based on the roles written for her voice her vocal range spanned from low A-flat to high D, 2.5 octaves. She and the tenor Adolphe Nourrit are credited with being primarily responsible for raising artistic standards at the Opéra, and the roles in which she excelled came to be known as &quot;falcon soprano&quot; parts. She had an exceptionally short career, essentially ending about five years after her debut, when at the age of 23 she lost her voice during a performance of Niedermeyer&#x27;s &quot;Stradella&quot;.

==Early life and training==
She was born Marie-Cornélie Falcon in Le Monastier sur Gazeille (Velay) to Pierre Falcon, a master-tailor and his wife Edmée-Cornélie. Falcon was one of three children; her sister Jenny Falcon was to marry a Russian nobleman and appear on the stage at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Cornélie was enrolled at the Paris Conservatory from 1827 to 1831. There she first studied with Felice Pellegrini and François-Louis Henry, and later with Marco Bordogni and Adolphe Nourrit. She won a second prize in &quot;solfège&quot; in 1829, a first prize in vocalization (&quot;vocalisation&quot;) in 1830, and a first prize in singing (&quot;chant&quot;) in 1831.

==Debut in &quot;Robert le diable&quot;==
At the invitation of Nourrit she made her debut at the age of 18 at the Opéra as Alice in the 41st performance of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot; (20 July 1832). The cast included Nourrit and Julie Dorus (who had premiered the role in 1830). The director of the Opéra, Louis Véron, had made certain there was plenty of advance publicity, and the auditorium was packed. The audience included the composers Rossini, Berlioz, Cherubini, Halévy, and Auber, the singers Maria Malibran, Caroline Branchu, and Giulia Grisi, and two of France&#x27;s greatest actresses from the Comédie-Française, Mademoiselle Mars and Mademoiselle Georges. Other audience members included the painters Honoré Daumier and Ary Scheffer, the librettist Eugène Scribe, and the critics and writers Théophile Gautier, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset. Although understandably suffering from stage fright, Falcon managed to sing her first aria without error, and finished her role with &quot;ease and competence.&quot; Her tragic demeanor and dark looks were highly appropriate to the part, and she made a vivid impression on the public.

Meyerbeer himself came to Paris to see Falcon as Alice, but after her fifth performance on 24 August she had to withdraw due to illness, and he did not get to hear her until 17 September. The following day Meyerbeer wrote to his wife: &quot;The house was as full as it ever could be, 8700 francs (without subscription) and many people could not find seats. The performance was ... so fresh ... like the first performance of the work, not a trace of being played out. About Falcon I dare not reach any definite conclusion, ... only it is evident that she has a strong and beautiful voice, not without agility, at the same time that she is a vividly expressive (but somewhat overcharged) actress. Unfortunately her intonation is not completely pure, and I fear she will never overcome these weaknesses. In sum, I think that she could be an outstanding star, and I will certainly in any case write a principal role for her in my new opera.&quot; Meyerbeer&#x27;s new opera would become &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, in which Falcon was to achieve the greatest success of her career.

==Other early roles at the Opéra==

Her next role at the Opéra came on 27 February 1833 when she sang Amélie in Auber&#x27;s &quot;Gustave III&quot;. Ellen Creathorne Clayton has described the performance as follows:

Unfortunately, the part of the Countess Amélie, with its powder and hoops, and pretty coquetry, was not suited to the dark and mystic style of Cornélie. &quot;Alas, Mdlle. Falcon!&quot; cried Jules Janin; &quot;this young creature, of such great hopes, sang without voice, without expression, without exertion, without energy, without point.&quot; She was stifled amid the mad gayety, the whirl of the dancers, the glare and splendor of the scenes. The singers in &quot;Gustave&quot; indeed were &quot;nowhere;&quot; the dancers reigned supreme.
Luigi Cherubini asked Falcon to create Morgiana in his new 4-act &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; &quot;Ali Baba, ou Les quarante voleurs&quot; (&quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;). The premiere was on 22 July 1833, and, as Spire Pitou tells us, &quot;his invitation was more flattering than substantial, because the part of Morgiana hardly constituted a real challenge to a young and ambitious singer&quot;.

Falcon&#x27;s next real opportunity to shine came with a new revival of &quot;Don Juan&quot;. This was a 5-act adaptation in French by Castil-Blaze, his son Henri Blaze, and Émile Deschamps of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. The all-star cast included Falcon as Donna Anna and Nourrit as Don Juan with Nicolas Levasseur as Leporello, Marcellin Lafont as Don Ottavio, Prosper Dérivis as the Commandeur, Henri Dabadie as Masetto, Julie Dorus-Gras as Elvire, and Laure Cinti-Damoreau as Zerline. Berlioz, who must have attended a dress rehearsal, had some reservations about Falcon&#x27;s performance, writing in &quot;Rénovateur&quot; (6 March 1834): 

Mlle Falcon, so energetic in &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;, was physically speaking, with her contenance &quot;pale as a beautiful autumn evening&quot;, the ideal Donna Anna. She had fine moments in the accompanied recitative sung over her father&#x27;s body. Why then did she all at once go off the boil in the great aria of the first act, &quot;Tu sais quel inflâme&quot;? Oh! Mlle Falcon, with those black eyes of yours and the incisive voice you possess, there is no need to be afraid. Let your eyes flash and your voice ring out: you will be yourself, and you will be the incarnation of the vengeful Spanish noblewoman whose principal features your timidity veiled from us.

Berlioz was rather more frank in a letter in which he wrote &quot;my position [as a critic] has not allowed me to admit that without exception all the singers, and Nourrit most of all, are a thousand miles below their roles.&quot; Nevertheless, Falcon was admirably suited to the part, and her reception after the opening on 10 March 1834, was even more favorable than that which she had received for Alice.

On 3 May 1834, Falcon sang Julia in a revival of Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; which was a benefit performance for Adolphe Nourrit. The cast, besides Nourrit as Licinius, included Nicolas Levasseur as Cinna, Henri Dabadie as the High Priest, and Zulmé Leroux-Dabadie as the Grand Vestal. The second act was repeated as an excerpt five more times that season. Falcon&#x27;s portrayal of Julia was received favorably.

==Concerts with Berlioz==
Berlioz&#x27;s admiration for the singer was considerable, however, and with Véron&#x27;s permission he engaged her for one of his concerts which he organized that winter in the hall of the Paris Conservatory. It was the second in the series and was presented on 23 November 1834 with Narcisse Girard conducting. Falcon sang Berlioz&#x27;s new orchestrations of the songs &quot;La captive&quot; and &quot;Le Jeune Pâtrie breton&quot;, and earned an encore in which she sang an aria by Bellini. The concert also featured the premiere of Berlioz&#x27;s new symphony &quot;Harold en Italie&quot;, and the audience included the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, Chopin, Liszt, and Victor Hugo. With the new symphony and Falcon as the star singer, the receipts were more than double those of the first concert on 9 November, which had featured the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and the overture &quot;Le Roi Lear&quot;. However, &quot;La captive&quot;, and not &quot;Harold&quot;, was the hit of the show, with the &quot;Gazette Musicale&quot; (7 December 1834) calling it &quot;a masterpiece of melodic skill and orchestration.&quot; Falcon also appeared the following year in a concert on 22 November 1835 which was organized jointly by Girard and Berlioz, in which she again sang Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Le Jeune Pâtre breton&quot; and an aria from Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot;.

==Further roles at the Opéra==

Falcon&#x27;s other creations at the Opéra included the roles of Rachel in Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot; (23 February 1835), Valentine in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (29 February 1836), the title role in Louise Bertin&#x27;s &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; (14 November 1836), and Léonor in Louis Niedermeyer&#x27;s &quot;Stradella&quot; (3 March 1837). She also appeared as the Countess in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; and Pamira in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; (1836).

By 1835, Falcon was earning 50,000 francs/year at the Opéra, making her the highest paid artist there, earning nearly twice as much as Nourrit and three times as much as Dorus.

==Vocal demise and final years==
However, Falcon&#x27;s singing career was remarkably short. She lost her voice catastrophically during the second performance of &quot;Stradella&quot; at the Opéra in March 1837. When Nourrit as Stradella asked her &quot;Demain nous partirons – voulez-vous?&quot; (&#x27;We leave tomorrow, are you willing?&#x27;), Falcon was unable to sing her line &quot;Je suis prête&quot; (&#x27;I am ready&#x27;), fainted, and was carried offstage by Nourrit. Berlioz, who was present, describes &quot;raucous sounds like those of a child with croup, guttural, whistling notes that quickly faded like those of a flute filled with water&quot;. Falcon resumed performances, but her vocal difficulties continued, and she gave her last regular performance there in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; on 15 January 1838. She resorted to all sorts of bogus treatments and remedies and moved to Italy for 18 months in the hope that the climate would have a beneficial effect.

Falcon returned for a benefit at the Opéra on 14 March 1840, in which she was to sing selections from Act 2 of &quot;La Juive&quot; and Act 4 of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; with Gilbert Duprez, Jean-Étienne Massol, and Julie Dorus-Gras. Her appearance was described as seemingly relaxed, as she received a standing ovation at her entrance. Her range in notes was critically diminished, and she could not perform in opera. She was said to have wept in response to her own vocal state. However, soon after it was discovered that her vocal abilities were now gone. As Spire Pitou relates: &quot;She wept at her own pathetic fate but continued despite her inability to do much else besides make the audience regret the loss of her gifts. When she came to the painfully poignant words in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &#x27;Nuit fatale, nuit d&#x27;alarmes, je n&#x27;ai plus d&#x27;avenir&#x27; (&#x27;Fatal night, night of alarms, I have no longer a future&#x27;), she could not support the dreadful irony of the line. She had no choice but to retire ...&quot; There followed a few performances in Russia in 1840–1841, but after that, except for a few private performances in Paris at the court of Louis-Philippe and for the Duc de Nemours, she definitively quit the stage.

Many explanations have been offered for Falcon&#x27;s loss of voice, including the enormous demands of the music of Grand Opera, the &quot;ill-effects of beginning to sing in a large opera house before her body was fully mature&quot;, Falcon&#x27;s attempts to lift her range above its natural mezzo-soprano range, and nervous fatigue brought on by her personal life. Benjamin Walton has analyzed the music written for her and has suggested there was a break in her voice between a&#x27; and b&#x27;. Gilbert Duprez, who sang with her on several occasions, speculated that her inability to negotiate this transition was a factor in her &quot;vocal demise&quot;.

Falcon married a financier, becoming Madame Falcon-Malançon and a grandmother, and continued to live, reclusively, near the Opéra in the Chaussée d&#x27;Antin, until her death. At the end of 1891, she agreed to appear on stage at the Opéra on the occasion of a celebration of the centenary of Meyerbeer, &quot;with three of her surviving contemporaries&quot;. She died in 1897 and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Reputation==

Having sung many of the important roles of early Grand Opera, Falcon was closely associated with the genre by contemporary audiences. The designation of the voice timbre &quot;falcon&quot;, a dramatic soprano with a strong lower register (and lighter upper register) reflects this. Castil-Blaze described her voice in 1832:
...A range of two octaves extending from b to d, and resonating at all points with an equal vigour. A silvery voice, with a brilliant timbre, incisive enough that even the weight of the chorus cannot overwhelm it; yet the sound emitted with such force never loses its charm or purity.

Falcon&#x27;s personal reputation was also relevant to her career. &quot;Perhaps the only singer of the time to maintain a reputation for chastity&quot;, this perception carried over to appreciation of her performances of the &quot;ingénue&quot; roles for which she was famed.

In 1844, Chorley wrote of Falcon as:

... the ill-starred Mademoiselle Falcon, the loved and the lost one of L&#x27;Académie.
She, indeed, was a person to haunt even a passing stranger. Though the seal of her race was upon her beauty, and it wore the expression of a Deborah or a Judith, rather than of a Melpomene, I have never seen any actress, who in look and gesture so well deserved the style and title of the Muse of Modern Tragedy. Large, dark, melancholy eyes, – finely cut features, – a form, though slight, not meagre, – and, above all, an expressiveness of tone rarely to be found in voices of her register, which was a legitimate &quot;soprano&quot;, – the power of engaging interest by mere glance and step when first she presented herself, and of exciting the strongest emotions of pity, or terror, or suspense, by the passion she could develope [sic] in action – such were her gifts. Add to these the charms of her youth, the love borne to her by all her comrades; – and the loss of her voice, followed by the almost desperate efforts made by her to recover it, and her disastrous final appearance when no force of will could torture destroyed Nature into even a momentary resuscitation, – make up one of those tragedies into which a fearful sum of wrecked hope and despair and anguish enters. Hers is a history, if all tales are true, too dark to be repeated, even with the honest purpose, not of pandering to an evil curiosity, but of pointing out the snares and pitfalls which lie in wait for the &quot;artiste&quot;, and of inquiring, for the sake of Art as well as of Humanity (the two are inseparable), if there be no protection against them, – no means for their avoidance?

<doc id="996979" wikidata="Q2165438" url="?curid=996979" title="Sunroof">
<text>A sunroof is a movable panel that opens to uncover a window in an automobile roof, allowing light and fresh air to enter the passenger compartment. Sunroofs can be manually operated or motor driven, and are available in many shapes, sizes and styles. While the term &quot;sunroof&quot; is now used generically to describe any moveable panel in the roof, the term &quot;moonroof&quot; was historically used to describe stationary glass panes rigidly mounted in the roof panel over the passenger compartment. A moonroof has a glass panel that is transparent and usually tinted. Previous terms include sunshine roof, sliding head, and sliding roof.

== History ==
A common configuration for early automobiles included a fixed roof for the rear passenger compartment and an uncovered section for the chauffeur in a style known as Coupe de Ville, Sedanca (two door) or Sedanca de Ville. An open cabin allowed the driver to be more connected to their surroundings, demonstrated that the car&#x27;s owner employed a paid driver (one reason chauffeurs wore uniform) and identified the owner through the driver&#x27;s livery (the other reason for the uniform). Road speeds were increasing and vehicles were changing from occasional use to full-time transport meaning that they were increasingly being used in bad weather. In order to provide better shelter for the driver therefore, temporary cover was now demanded. These part-time roofs, sometimes at first just a stretched piece of leather, became more sophisticated comprising frame elements and leather or water-resistant cloth to form the construction, and installations even included spaces provided to store the parts when not in use.

By the late 1920s, a more convenient version of the temporary roof was often being used where a solid metal panel would slide into a slot at the top of the passenger compartment, sometimes called a de Ville extension. By the early 1930s, cars were being constructed in the Sedan style comprising a metal one-piece roof without the gap above the driver&#x27;s cabin. To provide a similar facility to the earlier Coup de Ville configurations, sliding cloth or metal panels recognisable as the modern sunroof were regularly fitted to Bentley and Rolls-Royce models built by coach builders such as Barker, Gurney Nutting or Park Ward. In these cars, the continuous roofline, between the windscreen and passenger compartment, was unbroken and so, unlike the Coup de Ville, a coverable opening had to be let into the roof panel itself.

While at first the purpose may still have been to expose the chauffeur, Bentley cars in particular were increasingly sold for owners to drive themselves. Indeed, some models were provided with a sliding panel for the front seats even though the vehicle had just two-seats. Early &quot;Derby&quot; Bentley hard-top models were therefore frequently equipped with sliding sunroof panels, possibly more often than not. The purpose of the sliding panels thus changed from uncovering the chauffeur to allowing the owner to better enjoy their surroundings on fine weather days.

This evolution was eventually not limited to luxury motoring. The entrepreneur Noel Mobbs laid the foundation of the volume sunroof market when he evolved his coach building business into a company dedicated to the manufacture of sliding roofs in the name of Pytchley. The Pytchley mechanism was both patented and first publicly demonstrated in 1925. At first Pytchley used their sliding roof system to build a number of coach-built, custom &quot;tourer saloon&quot; automobiles sold from their premises at 201 - 203 Great Portland Street London. In 1927 they claimed for a Daimler 20/70 hp that &quot;This roof slides at the touch of a finger and opens up 50% of the roof area giving greater visibility and more air without draughts.&quot; The sliding roof system evolved from a device that Pytchley installed themselves, to an option which manufacturers offered as a standard body style. It was factory fitted to vehicles from a number of different manufacturers. By 1929 the design had improved so that when closed the moveable panel was flush with the rest of the roof. Morris built several models using Pytchley&#x27;s technology from 1932, including the Morris Minor, Morris Major and Morris Ten adding what became known as a Sliding Head (using the term head in the same way as Folding Head or Drop Head). This comprised a panel which could be slid back over the roof behind to create an opening above the driver and passenger. The sliding panel also incorporated locks which allowed the panel to be fixed at any position from fully closed to fully open. By 1935 Wolseley were using the Pytchley roof and by 1936 Austin too were also selling models with the sliding head. The Hillman Minx was another low-cost small car which was clearly not designed to be chauffeured, and in 1931 it was offered in a variety of body styles as was usual at that time, among the options was a sliding roof section including, on the 1933 Aero model with glass panels, as photographed on the 1932 show car, making this the first moonroof. In 1941 Pytchley took on the manufacturer Vauxhall for failure to pay royalties. Vauxhall claimed that their variation of the sliding roof, which slid the panel under the rear section rather than over, was sufficiently different to mean that a license need not be paid. Pytchley won the case.

Variations in moveable, removable and transparent roof panels continued. The Ford Lincoln X-100 concept car of 1953 revisited the Sedanca style for a non-chauffeured vehicle as it had a retractable transparent targa top which inspired later fixed moonroof panels on 1954 production vehicles. In 1961 Triumph launched the TR4 with a removable hard top roof split into two sections. The rear part, incorporating the rear window, could be left on the car when the centre piece was removed creating a Sedanca layout. This concept was resurrected again in 1966 when Porsche launched a version of its 911 sports car that established the term Targa, trademarked by Porsche. This bore even more of a resemblance to the traditional Sedanca form, as the car had both a permanently fixed roll-over hoop, and rear seats. While in 1969 Lamborghini showed the first full-roof framed transparent-panel roof, heralding the modern panoramic roof, on an Espada. 

Sunroofs, by historical definition are opaque. Today, most factory sliding sunroof options feature a glass panel and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs, a term introduced in 1973 by John Atkinson, a marketing manager at Ford for the Continental Mark IV. For the first year, Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation.

Variations of both the sunroof and moonroof have become the norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings, creating a wide range of features and choices. Sunroof systems may be manual or electric, while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic. Manual sunroofs may be lever actuated, as in venting type pop-ups, manual lever or crank operated for sliding systems. Electric roof systems are usually cable driven by a motor and feature some form of sliding opening. Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration (see sunroof types below).

Roof systems may be original equipment, factory options (provided by the car company), or installed aftermarket by a roof installation professional for the car dealer or retail customer. Once the vehicle leaves the assembly line, the factory option can no longer be integrated into the roof, making aftermarket the only option.

== Sunroof types ==
Roof systems are available in many shapes, sizes and styles, and are known by many names. The main types are as follows:

* Pop-up sunroofs are simply a manually operated tilting panel. These panels are sometimes removable, and like T-roofs, must be stored when removed. The tilting action provides a vent in the roof, or a full opening when the panel is removed. Pop-ups can be installed in most vehicles, and are relatively inexpensive. Examples include metal panels in the Porsche 944, the early Mazda RX-7, and many glass panel factory and aftermarket installations.
* Spoiler sunroofs (&quot;tilt-&amp;-slide&quot;s) combine the features of a pop-up with those of a sliding roof system. They tilt to vent and slide open above the roof, requiring little headroom or roof length. Spoilers typically do not provide as large an opening as other roof systems, but offer the convenience of a self-storing panel. Most spoiler roofs are electric, with optional features like integrated sun shades and express open/close. Spoilers are ideal for short-roof vehicles where other types of sliders cannot be installed. Examples include the Honda CRX, the Toyota Celica and the Mazda RX-7.
* Inbuilt sunroof systems have a panel which slides between the metal roof and interior headliner, requiring some loss of headroom but providing a full opening in the roof. All inbuilts slide inside the roof, while some also include a rear venting feature (see pop-up) or express open/close functions. Inbuilts do not fit every vehicle, as the panel must slide and store completely within the vehicle roof. Historically, inbuilts were a metal sunroof panel painted to match the vehicle roof, but now most are glass-panel systems with sliding sunshades (typically referred to as moonroofs). One of the first examples was the 1960 Ford Thunderbird.
* Folding sunroofs (often called rag-tops or cabrio coach) are a European tradition. They offer the convenience of a sunroof, with an opening more like a convertible. The panel is made of fabric (often vinyl), which folds back as it slides open. After a long absence in European and North American markets, folding sunroofs have experienced a resurgence with several new factory-installed options. Aftermarket versions were once only manual, but now are also available in powered versions. Examples include the original VW Beetle, Renault Twingo and Jeep Liberty.
* Top-mount sliding sunroofs (rail mount topslider) have been a popular factory option in Europe for many years. A large glass panel slides open in tracks on top of the roof, with no loss of headroom. Most feature an integral wind deflector to eliminate wind noise. Examples include Donmar&#x27;s original Skyroof topslider (aftermarket system), the London Taxi and Renault 5 cars.
* Panoramic roof systems are a type of large or multi-panel moonroof which offer openings above both the front and rear seats and may be operable or fixed glass panels. An early example visually very similar to many current versions was paraded around the Monaco Grand Prix circuit in 1969, it comprised a full-length fixed Plexiglas panel and was fitted to a Lamborghini Espada. The first example of a panoramic roof however was incorporated into the 1953 Lincoln XL-500 concept car which sported a full-length Plexiglas bubble canopy. Large operable openings are often accomplished with top-slider (tracks in the top of the roof) or spoiler type mechanisms. Examples include the Acura ZDX, Lexus ES, BMW Mini, Scion tC, Pontiac G6, Mercedes C Class, Volkswagen Eos, Porsche Cayenne, and the Tesla Model S.
* Removable roof panels (t-tops or targa roofs) open a vehicle roof to the side windows, providing a wider opening than other roof systems. The Targa body style is identical in configuration to the Sedanca but is designed for owner-driven rather than chauffeured cars and while a Sedanca style implies a rear passenger area, the Targa does not. T-roofs have two removable panels and leave a T-shaped structural brace in the roof center. Targa roofs include only one (opaque or transparent) panel and leave no cross brace. Aftermarket kits are no longer made, but several companies sell replacement and remanufactured panels, parts and accessories. Examples include Triumph TR4, Porsche 911 Targa, Suzuki Cappuccino, Toyota Supra, Pontiac Firebird, Chevrolet Corvette, Honda NSX, and Porsche 914.
* Solar sunroofs are made of glass, with an inlaid photovoltaic solar panel that makes the glass totally opaque. They operate the same as conventional factory-fitted glass moonroofs (tilting and retracting), but when closed the solar panel provides electricity to power the interior ventilation fans, for cooling the car interior on hot days when the car is standing outside in the sunlight. These are available as a factory option on the 2010 Prius, recent Audi cars, Renault Zoé, and also were available on some versions of the Mazda Millenia and Mazda 929.
* Electric vs. electronic Motorized power roof systems may be operated by a simple push-and-hold switch, or may include an electronic control module (ECM) to provide single-touch express opening, express closing, or auto-closing on ignition off.
* Moonroof is a transparent, usually glass or Plexiglas, sunroof that lets light in while closed. Examples include the Mk1 Ford Fiesta from 1976, the Mk3 Ford Escort from 1980, the Acura ILX, and Pontiac G6. The earliest example, although not called moonroof at the time, was the 1933 Hillman Aero Minx which could be fitted with a sliding roof panel including inset glass. An early use of a large-panel transparent roof section was the 1954 Ford Skyliner and Mercury Sun Valley models which borrowed in-part from the full panoramic roof of the Lincoln XL-500 concept car as well as the X-100. A fixed moonroof exclusively for rear seat passengers was a prominent feature of the Aston Martin Lagonda from series 2, to 4 which was launched in 1976.

<text>This is a list of life peerages in the peerage of the United Kingdom created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. On 1 October 2009, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 was repealed by Schedule 18 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 owing to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. As a result, the power to create law life peers lapsed, although the validity of life peerages created thereunder remains intact.

==List of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary==
This is a complete list of people who have been appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the terms of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. On 1 October 2009, the Lords Appeal in Ordinary became the first Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

Those appointees who were not already members of the House of Lords were created life peers; for their titles see above. Initially it was intended that peers created in this way would only sit in the House of Lords while serving their term as judges, but in 1887 (on the retirement of Lord Blackburn) the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1887 provided that former judges would retain their seats for life. Under the terms of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which transferred the judicial functions of the House of Lords to the new Supreme Court, previous Law Lords who were transferred to the Supreme Court do not have the right to speak and vote in the House until they leave office.

<doc id="996986" wikidata="Q1775253" url="?curid=996986" title="Tony Almeida">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Almeida is a fictional character portrayed by Carlos Bernard on the television series &quot;24&quot;. Almeida appeared in a total of 126 episodes (including &quot;24: Legacy&quot;), the second highest number of episodes of any character in the series, behind Jack Bauer (192, played by Kiefer Sutherland) and just ahead of Chloe O&#x27;Brian (125, played by Mary Lynn Rajskub). Despite initially having friction with Jack Bauer, he eventually develops a strong friendship with Jack and becomes one of the few people Jack trusts unconditionally with his life. However, the loss of his wife Michelle Dessler and unborn son at the hands of a government conspiracy drives him into despair and then rage. His descent into darkness and evil to seek revenge against those responsible for destroying his life is widely lamented by fans and showcases a dark contrast to Jack whose life has also been ruined by the government.

==Characterization==
Tony Almeida was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1972 to an Italian mother and a Spanish Portuguese father. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from San Diego State University and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Stanford University. He served in the United States Marine Corps and attended Scout Sniper and Surveillance and Target Acquisition training. He was honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant and worked as a systems analyst before being hired by CTU. He was previously on more episodes than any other character, second to Jack Bauer, but was surpassed by Chloe O&#x27;Brien.

==Appearances==
===&quot;24&quot;: Day 1===
Tony Almeida is a systems analyst and third-in-command at the Counter Terrorist Unit&#x27;s Los Angeles headquarters, and is romantically involved with fellow agent Nina Myers. Tony consequently has animosity towards the series&#x27; protagonist, Jack Bauer, who was formerly in a relationship with Nina.

Just after midnight, word arrives of an imminent assassination attempt on Democratic presidential candidate David Palmer. When Jack is forced to cease contact with CTU, Tony and Division become suspicious and place CTU under lockdown while George Mason interrogates key staff members. Tony&#x27;s suspicions are aroused further when Jack returns and sneaks Nina out of headquarters at gunpoint. Shortly thereafter, Tony and Nina interrogate Jamey Farrell, leading her to confess to her involvement with Ira Gaines, the terrorist behind the kidnapping of Jack&#x27;s wife and daughter. Jamey dies in an apparent suicide soon after this.

After Jack succeeds in rescuing Kim and Teri Bauer, both Alberta Green and Ryan Chappelle encourage Tony to report Jack for unnecessarily endangering Senator Palmer. However, Tony refuses. Kim and Teri flee from a CTU safe house when it is attacked by hitmen working for Gaines&#x27; employers, Andre and Alexis Drazen. After a confrontation by Nina, Tony visits Jack&#x27;s home and saves both Teri and Phil Parslow from being killed by Jovan Myovic.

Before the day&#x27;s end, Palmer is saved and the Drazens are killed. However, Nina is revealed to be a &quot;second&quot; mole working for the Drazens, having killed Jamey and staged Jamey&#x27;s suicide when Jamey exposed her (Nina). Jack realizes this by viewing security tapes which show Jamey&#x27;s murder. Nina is captured, though not before she kills several people while attempting to escape, including Teri. When Jack points the gun at Nina for her betrayal, Tony and George dissuade Jack from pulling the trigger. Tony can only watch in disgust and disbelief as the woman he thought he loved is led away.

===&quot;24&quot;: Day 2===
Tony becomes the new chief of staff and Mason&#x27;s second-in-command at CTU, and is present when Jack returns to the agency to assist in hunting down Second Wave, a Middle Eastern terrorist organization that plots to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles. When Kate Warner reports Reza Nayieer to CTU, Tony questions Reza and the Warner family. Though financial records link Reza to the leader of Second Wave, Syed Ali, Reza denies any involvement with terrorists. It is later revealed that Reza is indeed innocent and that his fiancée, Marie Warner, was the one collaborating with Ali.

Near the beginning of the second season, Mason was exposed to lethal dose of plutonium, leaving him with radiation sickness. Mason eventually passes along the leadership of CTU to Tony, and leaves the agency. One hour later, in a noble effort to remove the nuclear bomb from a populated area, Mason crashes a plane carrying the bomb into the Nevada desert, sacrificing his own life as it detonates. Under Tony&#x27;s command, CTU receives recordings of a meeting between Ali and representatives from three Middle Eastern countries at Cyprus.

Jack learns from Jonathan Wallace that the Cyprus recordings were false. After learning the truth himself, Tony, along with Michelle Dessler, begin covertly assisting Jack, and are eventually forced to physically incapacitate Chappelle. After Chappelle is found by Carrie, he orders their arrest. However, when Mike Novick orders Chappelle to assist Jack, Tony and Michelle, they are given immunity and reinstated. With Tony and Michelle&#x27;s assistance, Jack and Sherry Palmer, the president&#x27;s ex-wife, are able to get a recording implicating Peter Kingsley, the true manipulator of the day&#x27;s events, and prevent a war with the Middle East.

Throughout the day, Tony and Michelle begin to realize that they share a mutual attraction. At first, Tony keeps his distance out of hesitancy after what happened with Nina. After receiving parting advice from Mason, however, Michelle expresses an interest. The two become romantically involved and later marry.

While Jack Bauer is often pre-occupied with other tasks such as leads to save his daughter or find more information about the terrorist threats, Tony has been out in the field as extensively as both Jack and Chase Edmunds. Throughout the day, Tony apprehended Joseph Sin-Chung, who was currently posing as a crew member of the apprehended cargo boat named Lee Jin-Yu. He prevented a terrorist threat at a metro station prior to the capture of CTU. During the hour that CTU was held hostage, Tony guides Kim Bauer to encrypt the hard-drive containing the data of the undercover CTU agents, significantly slowing down the terrorists&#x27; progress in getting the information.

Shortly after Kim&#x27;s return to CTU, Tony leads one of the tactical teams disarming one of the bombs at a construction site situated along a fault line. Hours after the threat, Tony had to rush to the scene of a crime, which involved a hostage situation with Governor James Radford. After restraining as many confused gunmen as he could, he had to negotiate with the leader, who was merely a desperate man trying to save his sick son. Tony succeeds in calming down the gunman, but the gunman is found dead by the time Tony busts open the locked door. He started becoming suspicious of Radford as he checks the gunman&#x27;s body. Tony&#x27;s suspicions came true when an assistant of Governor Radford calls telling him to meet her at Fisher Pier, which was happening approximately at the same time as Chase Edmunds&#x27;s return to C.T.U.

Tony met up with the assistant and was given a keycard to Radford&#x27;s office, with the assistant suspecting that Radford was involved in terrorist activity. The suspicion came true as a helicopter ambushed the pair, killing the assistant. Tony barely escapes with his life and drives off to the Governor&#x27;s office building. After dealing with various gunmen under Radford&#x27;s payroll and rescuing any trapped civilians, Tony found evidence that showed Radford&#x27;s involvement with the terrorists. It turned out that Radford was seen conversing with Peter Madsen, Joseph Sin-Chung, and an unknown third man. Tony attempts to track Radford and manages to eavesdrop on Radford&#x27;s conversation with the unknown man. Radford attempted to walk out, but the assassin Mandy already kills Radford before Tony could do anything. Tony&#x27;s evidence proved invaluable since CTU was later able to identify the third man as Max.

While Jack and Chase were busy at Fort Lesker, Tony, Michelle, and Chappelle have information that Kate Warner is still alive, but Chappelle restricted Tony from notifying Jack under the guise of completing the established mission. A few hours later, the trace was complete being located at Max&#x27;s yacht. After berating Chappelle out of disgust, Tony heads back out to the field one more time to assist Jack and Chase at the L.A. Docks in a CTU helicopter. Tony picks up Chase first, and pilots the chopper to have Chase provide support fire for Jack before picking him up.

Tony maneuvers the helicopter around the yacht allowing Chase to mow down gunmen firing at them, while Jack abseils onto the deck of the yacht. As the day ends, Tony stays on the yacht with Kate to clean up the mess while Chase pilots the helicopter with a wounded Jack to a nearby hospital.

===24: Day 3===
Tony fields promotion offers from several CTU regional divisions. Despite this, he, Jack Bauer and Gael Ortega organize a covert sting operation designed to keep the deadly Cordilla virus out of the hands of the Salazars, a Mexican crime family. During the operation, Tony is shot in the neck in a shopping mall and incapacitated, leaving him comatose. After awakening, Tony returns to his CTU post to resume the operation. Tension mounts between Tony and Michelle over his health and his secrecy towards her. Michelle is later trapped inside a hotel as it becomes infected with the virus, and asks Tony to authorize the use of suicide capsules to the infected patrons.

Against Jack&#x27;s explicit wishes, Tony uses Kim in a field operation as a replacement for Jane Saunders, the daughter of rogue MI6 agent Stephen Saunders, in an attempt to secure collateral against him. Just as the FBI prepares to corner Saunders, he reveals that he has captured Michelle and will kill her unless Tony aids his escape. Tony acquiesces, allowing Saunders to evade the FBI and free Jane from CTU custody. Jack realizes Tony&#x27;s motives, and convinces him to work with CTU on a sting. At the arranged meeting, CTU intervenes and captures Saunders. However, Tony is arrested for treason.

===&quot;24&quot;: Day 4===
Tony enters the story once again by rescuing Jack and Audrey from armed hostiles at a security firm. It is afterwards revealed that Almeida was sent to prison for treason, but was released early when Jack secured a pardon from President Palmer. Michelle had left Tony due to his alcoholism and depression, leading him to move in with a woman named Jen Slater. There, Tony harbors Jack and Audrey Raines.

Tony considers the rescue a repayment of the debt he owes Jack for getting him out of prison and initially does not wish to be involved in the case any further. Jack respects Tony&#x27;s wishes, but when setting out from Tony&#x27;s house to apprehend a suspect on his own, Tony reasons that it would be stupid to let his friend go back out alone after saving his life and offers to help. This leads him to become further involved in the day&#x27;s events, eventually returning to CTU on a provisional basis.

Tensions rise when the Associate Special Agent in Charge of Division Bill Buchanan and Tony&#x27;s former wife, Michelle Dessler, take active command of CTU Los Angeles when incumbent Special Agent in Charge Erin Driscoll leaves for personal reasons.

Tony and Michelle clash at first, but gradually the two begin to realize they still have feelings for each other. Near the end of the day, they have agreed to leave CTU together and start a new life once the current threat is dealt with.

An assassin named Mandy who had made an attempt on President David Palmer&#x27;s life in Season Two, becomes the next lead and Bill Buchanan calls Tony into the field to help apprehend her. Tony is captured and Mandy uses him to coerce Michelle into providing her with an escape route, just as Saunders did to Tony in Season Three. Michelle is about to comply, but decides to tell Bill instead. Mandy attempts to fake her own and Tony&#x27;s death in a car bomb in order to escape. While being walked out of the building at gunpoint by her, Tony attempts to overcome Mandy, but eventually is rescued by Jack and Curtis, who have, by this point, seen through the ploy.

At the end of Day 4, when Walt Cummings, an overzealous member of the new Logan Administration, decides that Jack Bauer needs to die due to his part in an illegal raid on the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles, Tony plays an integral part in faking Jack&#x27;s death. After smuggling him out of CTU, Tony allows himself to have an emotional good-bye to his friend, before he and Michelle drive off to begin their new life.

===&quot;24&quot;: Day 5===
By Day 5, Tony and Michelle have left CTU and are living life together as civilians. After receiving news that Palmer has been assassinated, Michelle wants to go into CTU and assist in the investigation. Tony tries to dissuade her but she leaves without him and triggers a bomb planted under her car. Tony rushes from the house to see what has happened to his wife, but as he finds her body, the car&#x27;s fuel tank explodes, critically injuring him. It is later confirmed through CTU conversations that Michelle is dead.

Tony is transported to CTU Medical, where he undergoes surgery and is stabilized. Later, an assassin infiltrates CTU, impersonates a doctor and lures Jack down to medical by claiming Tony has awoken. Jack manages to foil the attempt on his life. Upon actually waking a few hours later, Tony is not aware that Michelle has died. Having been advised by the doctor that Tony should be kept calm, Bill Buchanan tells him that Michelle&#x27;s condition is still unknown. However, Tony suspects otherwise and escapes CTU Medical to access a computer, where he learns of his wife&#x27;s fate. Bill later informs him that CTU have discovered Christopher Henderson to be involved in the murder.

Tony ends up sealed inside CTU Medical along with Henderson when terrorists release Sentox nerve gas into the building, killing many members of the staff. Enraged and feeling he has nothing left to live for, Tony decides to kill Henderson by injecting him a lethal dose of hyoscine-pentothal while he is seemingly in a coma. Jack&#x27;s attempts to dissuade him eventually cause Tony to hesitate, however, and Henderson is given time to disarm Tony of the syringe and inject him with it before escaping. Before Jack can get him medical help, Tony apparently dies.

===&quot;24&quot;: Day 7===
Tony is discovered to be alive and currently working with a terrorist group to disrupt US President Allison Taylor&#x27;s invasion of Sangala by blackmailing her with terrorist attacks. It is ultimately revealed that Christopher Henderson purposely missed Tony&#x27;s heart when he stabbed him, and planned on turning him. He had his people take Tony&#x27;s body, and they were able to revive him within 10 minutes of his apparent death. Jack Bauer and the FBI apprehend Tony. Jack requests to interrogate Tony, but fails to get him to talk. However, during the interrogation, Tony taunts Jack into attacking him and while they fight, Tony is able to discreetly give Jack the code word &#x27;Deep Sky&#x27;. Jack recognizes this as an old CTU code for a phone number, which he calls once he is in private. The number leads him to Bill Buchanan and Chloe O&#x27;Brian who reveal that Tony was working undercover for them to uncover corrupt US officials working with General Benjamin Juma, the dictator of Sangala and perpetrator of mass genocide. Furthermore, Tony needs to be freed so he can continue his work. Jack breaks Tony out of FBI custody and joins him, Bill and Chloe in resuming their independent operation, which culminates in the elimination of the terrorist group, the unmasking of Juma&#x27;s allies in the U.S. government, and the deaths of General Juma and his squad of soldiers who storm the White House.

Following the end of the White House siege, Jack and Tony scramble to intercept and then recover a shipment of bioweapons engineered by Jonas Hodges, president of mercenary corporation Starkwood, who intends to blackmail the President and enact Executive legislation benefitting himself. Aided by the FBI, Jack and Tony successfully destroy the chemical weapons in the Starkwood compound, although Jack is exposed to the bio-weapon and infected.

Following the destruction of the weapons, it is revealed that Tony is actually working with the terrorists. He murders FBI Agent Larry Moss and recovers the one remaining canister of the chemical weapon, which he gives to Cara Bowden, a representative of the conspirators, all of whom had planned the day&#x27;s events and of whom Hodges was previously a member. Tony and the conspirators initiate their operation and attempt to detonate the canister inside the DC Metro tunnels. They are stopped by Jack and the FBI, who apprehend Tony and recover the canister before it can detonate. As they transport Tony to the FBI, Cara contacts Jack and through threats to his daughter Kim Bauer, forces him to help Tony escape custody. Jack hands Tony over to Cara, and they then take Jack hostage to salvage the remains of the virus from Jack&#x27;s infected blood, tissue and organs. Finally alone with Tony, Jack tries to reason with the man who was once his closest friend. Tony reveals that his true goal was always to get close enough to Alan Wilson, the head conspirator behind the day&#x27;s attacks and the man responsible for the murders of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler. Tony&#x27;s actions have convinced Wilson that he could be allowed further into the conspiracy circle and sets up a rare meeting, at which Tony plans to turn on him.

Wilson arrives to speak with Tony, but the group is ambushed by the FBI. Retreating into a warehouse, Tony kills Cara and corners Wilson. As Tony prepares to kill him, he reveals that not only did Wilson kill Michelle, but he also killed their unborn son. Jack and Renee arrive, disabling Tony before he has the chance to carry out his revenge. Tony is led away into FBI custody once again, cursing and raging at Jack.

===&quot;24: Solitary&quot;===
In the seven-minute special feature exclusive to the Live Another Day Blu-ray set, &quot;24: Solitary&quot;, Tony requests to be moved to general population, approximately 8 years after Day 7, so that he can serve as an undercover “inside source” and provide actionable Intel about other prisoners. He states that his desire for revenge consumed him and that Michelle “never would’ve approved of the man I became” following her death. He accepts the fact that he’s going to die in prison, but hopes to save at least one life so that he can be worthy of Michelle’s love again. When the Prison Administrator denies Tony&#x27;s case due to U.S. Attorney Vanessa Diaz&#x27;s (who opposes any reduction in Tony&#x27;s security) evidence, Tony violently attacks her. After Tony is taken out of the room, it is revealed that the attack was a ruse so that Diaz could pass off her glasses to Tony. Vanessa calls her contact on a secure line and informs him that Tony has the plans. Tony puts the glasses on and presses a hidden button on the side of the frame, which reveals a schematic to the prison with a carefully planned escape route on the lenses. He is confident that everything is going according to plan and that, soon, he will be a free man again.

===&quot;24: Legacy&quot;===
Tony Almeida returns in the &quot;24&quot; spin-off, &quot;24: Legacy&quot;, having escaped from prison and become a mercenary. When Henry Donovan withholds information about his dealings with terrorists and CTU is unable to break him, Rebecca Ingram hires Almeida to provide enhanced interrogation. Almeida is later paid to kill Ara Naseri by Donald Simms and comes into conflict with Eric Carter. Almeida refuses to stand down and loses most of his team to Carter. Almeida gets a call from John Donovan revealing the identity of Naseri and the fact that Naseri is their best chance to save Rebecca. Almeida stands down and tells Carter to save Rebecca.

<doc id="996988" wikidata="Q5387560" url="?curid=996988" title="Eric Stefanson">
<text>Eric Stefanson (born October 24, 1950) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the cabinet of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon from 1991 to 1999, and was a member of the Manitoba Legislature from 1990 to 2000. His father, also named Eric Stefanson, was a Progressive Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1958 to 1968.

Stefanson was born in Gimli, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He later practiced as a chartered accountant. Stefanson was a member of the Winnipeg city council from 1982 to 1989 for the St. Charles riding, serving as Chair of the Finance Committee from 1984 to 1986 and Deputy Mayor from 1986 to 1988.

In the 1990 provincial election, Stefanson was elected to the provincial legislature in the upscale west Winnipeg riding of Kirkfield Park, defeating Liberal Jason McKee by over 2000 votes. On February 5, 1991, he was appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism with responsibility for the Development Corporation Act, Sport, Fitness and Amateur Sport and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act. On September 10, 1993, Stefanson was promoted to Minister of Finance and Chair of the Treasury Board.

Stefanson was easily re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Vic Wieler by over 3000 votes. On May 9, 1995, he was relieved of the Treasury Board portfolio and given responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act (remaining Minister of Finance). On January 6, 1997, he was again given responsibility for the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act.

In a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1999, Stefanson was appointed Minister of Health and Deputy Premier, also retaining responsibilities of the Boxing/Wrestling Commission and Fitness/Amateur Sport Acts. He scored another easy victory in the 1999 provincial election (defeating New Democrat Dennis Kshyk by over 3,000 votes), but the Progressive Conservative party was defeated by the NDP at the provincial level and Stefanson moved into opposition. Although touted by many as a possible party leader after the resignation of Gary Filmon, he decided not to run for the position. On September 7, 2000, Stefanson resigned from the legislature to provide a seat for the party&#x27;s incoming leader, Stuart Murray.

During his time in government, Stefanson was one of the most powerful ministers in Gary Filmon&#x27;s cabinet. He presided over a series of balanced budgets, achieved at the cost of considerable cuts in public funding for various programs. In 1998, Stefanson was accused by some of exercising undue ministerial influence in the appointment of his brother, Tom, as CEO of Manitoba Telecom Services; no formal charges of impropriety were made, however. In 2000, he supported Tom Long for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party.

From 2004 to 2009, Stefanson was a regional managing partner for BDO Dunwoody.

In January 2007, he was appointed by federal transport minister Lawrence Cannon to the board of directors of Via Rail Canada.

<text>Jay Alan Sekulow (; born June 10, 1956) is an American lawyer, radio, television talk show host and politically conservative media personality. He has been chief counsel of the American Center for Law &amp; Justice (ACLJ) since 1991. As a member of President Donald Trump&#x27;s legal team, he served as lead outside counsel for Trump&#x27;s first impeachment trial in the United States Senate.

Sekulow built a legal and media business over a thirty-year period by representing conservative, religious, and anti-abortion groups. He hosts a syndicated radio show and is a frequent guest commentator on the Christian Broadcasting Network and the Fox News Channel television networks.

==Early life and education==
Jay Alan Sekulow was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Natalie (&quot;née&quot; Wortman) and Stanley Sekulow.

Sekulow was raised on Long Island, in the town of Jericho. He came from a Jewish family, attended Hebrew school, and had a &quot;bar mitzvah&quot;. While in high school, Sekulow moved with his family to Atlanta, where he graduated from Lakeside High School, then earned a B.A. in 1977 and a J.D. from Mercer University in 1980. While attending Atlanta Baptist College (now the Atlanta campus of Mercer University), Sekulow encountered Jews for Jesus, became interested in Christianity, and converted to Messianic Judaism. Sekulow earned a Ph.D. from Regent University in 2004, writing his dissertation on the influence of religion on Supreme Court justices and their opinions.

==Career and business ownership==
After graduating from law school, Sekulow worked at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a prosecutor with the tax litigation division for &quot;about 18 months.&quot;

In 1982, he opened a law firm in Atlanta, Georgia, with former Mercer classmate Stuart J. Roth which soon evolved into a business buying, renovating, and selling historic properties as a tax shelter for wealthy investors. IRS regulations changed in the mid-eighties, and the firm collapsed when investors sued the owners for fraud and securities violations. Sekulow and Roth filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 1987, with Sekulow listing $13 million in liabilities and $638,000 in assets, and leaving &quot;a trail of angry investors and employees.&quot;

In 1987 Sekulow became general counsel for Jews for Jesus. In 1988 he founded the nonprofit group Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism (CASE) whose president he is and whose board members are him, his wife, and their two sons.

In 1992, Sekulow became the director of the ACLJ, where he was chief counsel and principal officer in 2018. In the early 1990s he also joined the faculty at Regent University Law School.

Sekulow is half-owner of the for-profit professional corporation Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, P.C., incorporated in 2003, whose governor and executive officer is Roth. From 2011 to 2016, the ACLJ paid the group $23 million, &quot;its largest outside expense.&quot;

Sekulow owns Regency Productions, the company that produces his radio show and was paid $11.3 million by the two charities for production services between 2000 and 2017.

Sekulow hosts &quot;Jay Sekulow Live!&quot;, a syndicated daily radio program broadcast on terrestrial radio, and XM and Sirius satellite radios. This live call-in program focuses on legal and legislative topics. Sekulow is the host of &quot;ACLJ This Week&quot;, a weekly television news program broadcast on Trinity Broadcasting Network and Daystar.

==Counsel to President Trump==
Beginning in 2017, Sekulow served as a personal attorney to President Donald Trump during the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and investigations by Congressional committees into the myriad links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies.

Sekulow also served as lead outside counsel for Trump during his impeachment proceedings in 2019 and 2020. He made several allegedly false statements on the Senate floor during the first Trump impeachment trial.

Sekulow also represented Trump confidant and Fox News host Sean Hannity during the investigation by the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.

==Charity finances==
In November 2005, &quot;Legal Times&quot; published an article which alleged that Sekulow &quot;through the ACLJ and a string of interconnected nonprofit and for-profit entities, has built a financial empire that generates millions of dollars a year and supports a lavish lifestyle—complete with multiple homes, chauffeur-driven cars, and a private jet that he once used to ferry Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.&quot; In the article, former donors and supporters claimed that Sekulow engaged in a pattern of self-dealing to finance his &quot;high-flying lifestyle.&quot; According to a ranking by the American Institute of Philanthropy, a charity watchdog group, Sekulow was the thirteenth highest-paid executive of a charitable organization in the United States.

ACLJ&#x27;s and CASE&#x27;s tax returns show that between 1998 and 2011, they paid more than $33 million to Sekulow, members of his family, and businesses owned or co-owned by them; from 2011 to 2015, the two charities paid $5.5 million to Sekulow and members of his family and $23 million to their businesses. Since 2011, donations to ACLJ are routed through Sekulow&#x27;s family-run CASE, and many &quot;transactions that benefit members of the Sekulow family are disclosed on the CASE returns, but not the ACLJ&#x27;s.&quot; Between 2011 and 2015, the ACLJ, the &quot;public face of the two nonprofits,&quot; collected nearly $230 million in charitable donations.

On June 27 and 28, 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that documents obtained by them confirmed later that &quot;millions in donations&quot; were steered to his family members; that Sekulow &quot;approved plans to push poor and jobless people to donate money to his Christian nonprofit, which since 2000 has steered more than $60m to Sekulow, his family and their businesses&quot;; and that attorneys general in New York and North Carolina opened investigations of Sekulow&#x27;s CASE for possibly using pressure tactics in telemarketer calls to raise money which was allegedly misdirected to Sekulow and his family.

==News and politics==
Sekulow is thought by some in Washington to have been one of the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; who &quot;engineered&quot; the nomination of Chief Justice John G. Roberts to the Supreme Court. In 2007, Sekulow endorsed Mitt Romney&#x27;s presidential campaign. He has opposed the building of Park51, an Islamic center in Lower Manhattan two blocks from the World Trade Center.

On February 27, 2019, Michael Cohen reported in testimony before Congress that Jay Sekulow and other members of Trump&#x27;s legal team made “several” changes to his false statement to the House Intelligence Committee, including a change to the “length of time that the Trump Tower project stayed and remained alive.” Sekulow disputed the testimony &quot;Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false&quot;. The Intelligence Committee announced on May 14, 2019, that it would investigate whether Sekulow “reviewed, shaped and edited” Michael Cohen&#x27;s false testimony to Congress. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on May 20, 2019, that Cohen testified in closed session before the Intelligence Committee that Sekulow instructed him to falsely testify that the Trump Tower Moscow discussions ended in January 2016. The Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s August 2020 final report on 2016 election interference noted that after his indictment, Cohen discussed a presidential pardon with Sekulow more than six times, and that &quot;he understood that the pardon discussions had come from Trump through Sekulow.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in December 2019 that people close to Sekulow said he told them he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, January, he was named as part of the counsel team that represented Donald Trump in the impeachment case in the Senate.

==Personal life==
Sekulow and Pamela McPherson married in 1978 and have two adult sons, Jordan and Logan. Jordan Sekulow is an attorney with the ACLJ and Director of International Operations. He also co-hosts the radio and television programming with his father. Logan briefly starred in the Nickelodeon series &quot;U-Pick Live&quot; in 2005.

Sekulow is a Messianic Jew and a convert to Christianity. Sekulow&#x27;s youngest brother Scott was the founder and Rabbi of the Messianic Jewish Congregation Beth Adonai in Atlanta, Georgia, until his death in August 2021 of COVID-19.

Sekulow is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Supreme Court Historical Society in Washington, D.C. He plays drums and guitar in the &quot;Jay Sekulow Band&quot;, which includes John Elefante, a former member of the band Kansas, and John W. Schlitt, a former member of Head East and Petra, among its members.

Sekulow most recently argued before the Supreme Court on November 12, 2008, in &quot;Pleasant Grove City v. Summum&quot;, case No.07-665. Sekulow represented the city in this case concerning government control over monuments and memorials in government-owned public places, which ended the following February with the Court ruling in the city&#x27;s favor. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court issued a summary disposition in the companion case of &quot;Summum v. Duchesne City&quot;. The Court vacated the Tenth Circuit opinion and remanding the case for an opinion consistent with &quot;Pleasant Grove City v. Summum&quot;, 555 U.S. 460 (2009).

Bush&quot;, &quot;Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood&quot;, and &quot;Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation&quot;. His amicus briefs for &quot;Van Orden v. Perry&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC&quot; were cited by Justices John Paul Stevens and John Roberts respectively. Sekulow was counsel to Robert and Mary Schindler during the controversy surrounding their daughter, Terri Schiavo. Sekulow&#x27;s amicus brief in &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot; was in support of the ACLU&#x27;s position; he argued that schools banning &quot;offensive&quot; speech would also be able to prohibit religious speech with which the administrators disagree.

<text>The Rai (Kirati: also known as Jimee or Khambu, &quot;Rāi&quot;; Devanagari: राई) are an ethnolinguistic group belonging to the Kirat family and primarily Tibeto-Burman linguistic ethnicity. They are indigenous to the eastern parts of Nepal, the Indian states of Sikkim, West Bengal (predominantly Darjeeling and Kalimpong Hills) and in southwestern Bhutan.
The Rai, as a set of groups, are one of the oldest tribes of Nepal. They inhabited the area between the Dudh Koshi and Tamur River in Nepal. They claim that their country called Kiratdesh in modern times, has spread over Nepal, Sikkim and West Bengal. Rai is a derivative of commander. This title is said to have been conferred on the Khambu by Prithvinarayan Shah after the Gorkha conquest of Khambuan,&quot; . Rai are also known as &quot;Khambu&quot; in some places.They are known for worshipping nature and ancestral spirits. Rai are one of the tribes of the Kirati group; they are a fighting tribe of Nepal. They are popularly believed to have offered a stiff resistance to the invasion of the Gorkhas. Kiranti Rai are hill tribes who once possessed considerable power and territory but were reduced to submission by Prithvi Narayan Shah after his conquest of Nepal.
Kirati rule in the eastern hills of Nepal ended after the conquest of the Gorkha Kingdom in 1772–1773.

== History ==
=== Mythology of Rai People ===

Rai tradition relates that the first of the ancestral Kirati entered Nepal&#x27;s eastern hills through the Barahachhetra gorge of the Kosi Valley the natural gateway into the region through the Mahabharat Range, which separates the hilly hinterland from the plains. According to the Mundum, in oral history, Kirati ancestors came out of the &quot;Khuwalung&quot; and then followed the small river of the Saptakoshi. They journeyed through the Arun, Dudh Koshi, Sun Koshi and Tama Koshi and finally settled down in the Bhote Koshi valley.

According to the myths of the Kirati Rai people &quot;Tayama&quot; (elder sister), &quot;Khiyama&quot; (younger sister) and &quot;Raichhakule&quot; ( Tayama and Khimaya&#x27;s younger brother) are supposed to be the primaeval ancestors of the Kirati Rai&#x27;s Civilization. The sisters are believed to have lived in &quot;Tuwachung&quot; whereas the brother in the cave of Halesi. Tayama and Khiyama were skilful in weaving the looms. They are regarded as the pioneers of textiles. Tayama is recognized by names like: Khew, Toyama, Toma, Tayama, Tangwama, Jauma, Jaumo, Dawa and Kakcha, and accordingly, Khiyama is also called Khema, Khiwama, Khliuma, Khlemo, Khewa, Khauma and Los in distinct Kiranti languages. Raichhakule (younger brother of Tayama and Khimaya) also known as Hetchhakuppa, Hetchhakuwa, Khokchilipa, Khakchhilip etc. is considered to be the beginner of the agricultural era in the cultural history of Kirati- Rai People.

Salpa Pokhari is believed to be the origin of Kirati-Rai. Salpa Pokhori is the centre of cultural belief for Kirati Rai and is related to the myth of &quot;Salpa&quot; and &quot;Ribrima&quot;(Salpa King and Queen). so Kirati Rai believed to have been born from these ancestors, Salpa and Ribrima. Salpa Pokhori is very significant and popular among Kirati Rai from cultural and religious views according to the Kirati Rai&#x27;s myth, this place is the origin of the Kirati Rai people. The Sillichung Mountain known as the prime tribute is supposed to be the origin of &quot;Mundum&quot; according to the Kirati myth.

=== Kirat Dynasty in Kathmandu Valley ===

Nepal enters into real historical era with the conquest of Kathmandu Valley by the Kiratis. The Kiratis are said to have been the aborigines inhabiting Eastern Nepal and having their own administrative set-up. Under the able leadership of their chieftain &quot;Yalung&quot; or Yalambar the Kiratis defeated Bhuwan Singh; the last king in the Ahir Dynasty and brought the Kathmandu valley under their sway. From various sources mentioning Long period altogether 29 to 32 Kirati kings who had ruled over Nepal 1225 years from 800 BCE to 300 AD. Gopal genealogy mentions 32 Kirati Kings to have ruled over Nepal different genealogies have found to be stating different names of last Kirati King. The Lichhavi monarchical dynasty was established in Nepal by defeating last Kirati King &#x27;Khigu&#x27;, according to Gopal genealogy, &#x27;Galiz&#x27; according to language-genealogy and &#x27;Gasti&#x27;, according to Wright genealogy. Chyasal is the place of final battlefield for Kiratis and Lichhavis. About 250 A.D. Kirati rule end in Kathmandu Valley and Kiratis moved towards east. Various ancient historical, archeological sites related to history of Kiratis and Kirati period in Kathmandu Valley like Chyasal, Patan Durbar, Patuk Don, Gokarna, Thankot, Birupakshya, Lalitpur, Akash Bhairav etc.

=== Kirat Kingdom in the east ===
According to historians the Lichhavis got victory only over Kathmandu. in other parts of the eastern country Kirati rule is still maintained. After the defeated Kiratis by Lichhavis in Kathmandu valley the Kiratis moved gradually east wards ruling in the small territories. In the process of expansion Kiratis extended from Banepa, Dulikhel, Sindupalchok, Darawardanda, Dolakha, Charikot to Kiratichap. Kiratis built a fort in Kiratichap and started to rule again still many evidences of Kiratis ancient ruins graveyard can be found in Dolakha, Sindupalchok region like &quot;Kirat Thursa&quot; in Jiri &quot;Kiratichap&quot; in Dolakha. according to various folklore and oral history Lichhavi attacked again Kiratis in Dolakha and chased away. In Pursuit of the fertile land some kiratis followed Sunkoshi river they become Sunuwar. others who followed the Tamakoshi, Dudhkoshi, Arun and Tamur rivers they become today&#x27;s Rai, Yakkha, Sunuwar and Limbu . After settling down in different areas Kiratis made their appropriate &#x27;Kipat,&#x27; &#x27;the area,&#x27; and again in the mountain region eastern hills Kiratis ruled over for centuries. in course of time due to the geo-political division three Kirati states were created as Wallo Kirat(Near Kirat), Majh Kirat (Middle Kirat) and Pallo Kirat or (Far east Kirat).

=== Gorkhali conquest in Kirat country ===
Around 1743 AD King Prithvi Narayan Shah of Gorkha started to Unification of Nepal campaign, conquering many small states Gorkhalis also started to attacked in the Kirat Region. according to historians, before the unification of Nepal by Prithvivinaryan Shah from Banepa to Trishuli River and around Teesta River known as Kiratdesh the territory of Kiratis. Looking at the evidence of the time when Prithvinarayan Shah expanded the Gorkha kingdom, Dolakha, Ramechhap and Sindhuli fall in Wallo Kirat and the part from Sunkoshi to upper Arun river falls in Manjh Kirat . The area from Upper Arun Arun river to East Teesta River falls within Pallo Kirat . when Prithvi Narayan Shah invaded the Dhulikhel border area of (Wallo Kirat) in 1768 AD, that time the Kirat King of Dhulikhel Chaukhat Mahindra Sing Rai and his brother Namsing Rai strongly resisted and fought valiantly with Prithivinarayan shah&#x27;s huge army for a very long time. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had deployed &quot;Sardar&quot; Ram Krishna Kunwar to the invasion of Kirant regional areas comprising; Pallo Kirant, Wallo Kirant and Majh Kirant. There are many kings and chiftens and forts under Wallo Kirat and Majh Kirat area. It is mentioned in the book &quot;Mechi to Mahakali&quot; Part-1 eight thums forts of (Wallo Kirat) Okhaldhunga, namely Bungnam, Taluwa, Chyanam, Solu, Tilpung, Chisankhu, Chuplu and Chauras. other forts in Majh Kirat are Hatuwa, Chawdandi, Mukali, Halesi, Khotehang, Kulum, Majhuwa, Khamtel, Pamakham, Rawa and Kepilas one by one, the Gorkhalis conquered all these forts in Wallo and Majh Kirat.

At the time when Prithivi Narayan Shah conquered the Kirat region. In this historical period, Waling Hang was the king in Hatuwā Gaḍhi(Majh Kirat) in across the Arun River. The kings of Hatuwa extended their rule over part of Khalsa. The Khalsa territory present day Ankhisalla, Dhankuta District ruled by King Budhahang. Budhahang disappeared when Prithivi Narayan Shah attacked him. It is said that during the war with the Shah king, he could revive dead Kirati warriors who were killed. On 29 August 1772, Ram Krishna Kanwar crossed Dudhkoshi river enter Chaudandi to invade of Kirant and Saptari region with fellow commander Abhiman Singh Basnyat.

Khambu Kirati Youths who were skilled archers, stemmed the advance of the Gorkhali troops at every step with their arrows. they inflicted heavy losses on the Gorkhalis, so that Prithivinarayan Shah had to send reinforcement sounder the commend of Subedar Shiva Narayan Khatri. Chatim Rai of Rawa Khola and Atal Rai of Pamakham were two principal Khambus Kirati ultimately proved ineffective before, the bows and arrows of the Gorkhalis. within a period of 5 months the Gorkhalis occupied Rawa, Halesi, Majuwa, Kulum and Dingla thus conquering the hole of Majh Kirat.

== Culture ==
Rai Community has its own traditional culture and rituals. all Rai people practice same rituals of life from birth to death. but there are some variation in rites and rituals in Rai communities living in different places.
=== Marriage system ===
Marriage in Rai group is not merely a biological and psychological relation between the couple, but essentially considered a social phenomenon that must be approved by the society. Unless the society gives recognition to the couples, they find their marital relation insecure. After the marriage, the woman&#x27;s clan is not changed, though she stays with her husband; but her children follow the clan of her husband. Both the practices of monogamy and polygamy are found among Rai; but the system of polygamy has declined greatly for legal reason and due to change of attitude.

Some traditional important types of marriage found among Rai are:

a) Chori Biha (theft marriage): It is called Chori Biha by Rai. If a man takes a woman away from her home secretly without informing her parents, it is called &#x27;theft marriage&#x27;. This sort of marriage is a bit different from &#x27;love marriage&#x27;, in that the man and woman may not have developed personal relationship for a long time, which is found in love marriage. The man may like the woman all of a sudden, which the woman may not be noticing. All of a sudden, the man expresses his wish to marry her when he meets her on some occasion or gathering – like in the fairs and marketplace. In such a case, if some of her relatives or close friends encourage her to elope with the man, she may be convinced and becomes ready to go with him.

Nowadays theft marriage is gradually being replaced by &#x27;love marriage&#x27;, in which the concerned boy and girl spend some time to know each other without the influence or intervention of anybody; then they can either decide to marry, just maintain their friendship or discontinue it, depending on how far the two parties like or dislike each other.

b) Zari Biha (marriage by paying penalty): Taking the wife of another man away in her consent for the purpose of marriage is called Zari Biha in Rai community. In such a case, a certain amount of cash is paid as a penalty by the woman&#x27;s new husband to the earlier one.

c) Senzi Zari Biha (widow marriage): In Rai community, there is not any social prohibition for the widows to marry. A widow or widower is allowed to get married, though it is not a compulsion.
In this marriage, a certain penalty is paid to the widow&#x27;s father-in-law or the senior family member, as a compensation for losing a member of the family.

d) Magi Biha (arranged marriage): Arranged marriage is performed with the mutual understanding and arrangements of both the families – the boy&#x27;s side and the girl&#x27;s side. It is called Magi Biha. In this marriage, the consent of the girl, the forthcoming bride, is a must.

=== Death ritual ===
In Rai community death is distinguished between the natural death and unnatural death in their rites of the passage as well. In the case of natural death, the body is either buried or cremated, upon the wish of the dead person. But the body must be buried in the case of unnatural death. There are many formalities in the death ritual if it is the natural death; but such formalities are less in the case of unnatural death, since it is believed that such a death turns the person into evil.

If a baby dies before the growth of his/her tooth, the funeral rite observed is very simply. Such a death is considered a bad omen and categorized under unnatural death. The pollution and purification rituals are completed on the same day in such cases

If a pregnant woman dies, her lower abdomen is bisected with a bamboo knife and the child is removed from her body. The mother and the child are buried at different burial sites according to the ritual of unnatural death. The pollution and purification ritual is completed on the same day. In the case of natural death, complete funeral rite is observed; and pollution and purification rituals are strictly followed. among Rai community a salt eating and oil drinking ceremony is performed three days after the death. On the ninth and tenth days, a Mangpa(Shaman) performs a merit making ceremony for the deceased. This ritual is done to put the deceased soul to a rest; otherwise, it is believed that the deceased person&#x27;s spirit will bring harm to the family.

=== Family and kinship ===
Rai have the practice of living in both the nuclear and joint families. In the nuclear family, there are two generations of people, whereas a joint family has three or more generations living together by sharing the same house and kitchen. Normally the son does not get separated immediately after his marriage. But after the marriage of his younger brother, he may wish to live separately. At the time of separation, the parental property is divided equally between the parents and sons.

Mainly three forms of kinship are found among Rai: i) kinship by blood; e.g. brother and sister, ii) kinship by marriage; e.g. father-in-law, sister-in-law, etc., iii) kinship by social relation; e.g. Miteri (friendship bond established after a special ritual) relation.

Kinship behaviour varies according to the status of the kin. Some relatives are more respectable than others, while some are in &#x27;joking relation&#x27;. For instance, father, mother, uncle and aunt are respectable, but solti-soltinee, sali-bhena, are all in joking relation. In Rai community, son-in-law and daughter-in-law are treated equally as the son or daughter of the family.

=== Gender issues and decision-making procedure ===
Men and women having equal status in the family and community, there is almost no gender discrimination in Rai society. Although man is usually the head of the family, woman&#x27;s role is equally important in planning and decision making on domestic matters. The husband decides almost nothing in absence of his wife. They generally discuss to plan the daily activities collectively in the family after dinner; and decision is made thereupon.

After a year of the death of her husband, a widow can wear her casual dresses. There is no restriction for the widow or widower regarding their clothing. They also have the freedom for remarriage; but whether to marry or not depends entirely on the widow&#x27;s or widower&#x27;s wish. An unmarried adult woman possesses very strong role in the family. She is heard by all.

Male and female members of family share their labour in all sorts of activities. However, a few cases are exceptions; e.g. cooking meals, which is mostly considered the responsibility of women. But when women are very busy, men take the responsibility of cooking as well. Similarly, though ploughing the field is generally considered the work of men, unmarried girls are also found involved in it to support men in their work.

=== Attire and ornaments ===
====Women====
Rai women used to weave homespun cloth from the khadi, cotton, wool and allo nettle plant.
====Men====
Rai men wear Wachinari Mala (Dzi bead), Potlung (Puwalo Mala) garland, and animal tooth necklaces. Male dress comprises headgear (feta; pagari; sayabung); Betebung shirt (dawm; lockchham); pant (suruwal; langsup); sleeveless coat made of stinging nettle plant fiber (chhakchha; fenga); waistband (narimokty); (patuki, chakchhinma), a large knife (khukuri, dabhay).

== Religion ==
Rai have been following Kirat religion since the ancient times. Kirat religion is based on animistic nature and ancestor worship. Rai do not believe in heaven or hell. There is no religious hierarchy. Kirati Rai engages Nakchong, Mangpa, Bijuwa, Nakso their tribal shamans in their religious rites. During the course of their recent history the Rai has increasingly borrowed elements from the major religions they have had contact with from Lamaist Buddhism or Nepalese Hinduism without however renouncing their own tribal traditions. As per Nepali Census of 2011 AD, roughly one third of Rai people follow Hinduism(30 %), two third follow Kirat Mundhum Dharma(65 %), while 5% are Christians.

=== Suptulung: Places of sacred worship ===

Teen Chula or Chula Dhunga &quot;The three hearth made stones&quot; called Dayahulung or Suptulung is the central part all the rituals or rites of Rai practised from birth to death are done in this Teen Chula &#x27;Suptulung&#x27; The major deity of all Rai is &#x27;Teen chula&#x27; (Suptulung) The three hearthmade stoned oven&#x27; of the house. &quot;The Term Lu or Lung refers to the stone and thus the suffix like lu or lung is found in most of the names of the oven in house eg; Taplelung, Suptulung, Mayalung, Ghewalung etc. Almost every thing from the right beginning of birth &#x27;cradle to the tomb&#x27; is performed on the sacred teen chula without Teen Chula no rituals can be done. In Rai culture, Teen Chula is the gate-way to enter in the real and practical day to day life. There is (Suptulung) &#x27;Teen Chula&#x27; in every house of Rai. It is buried on one side of the inner corner of the house. It said that &quot;Dash Rai Dash Bhasa Ek Chula&quot; &quot;There is Same Teen Chula of all ten diversified Rai&quot; it is believed that in the beginning there is only Ten &#x27;Thars&#x27; of Rai but later Rai are divide into many &#x27;thars&#x27; sub-group Teen Chula (Suptulung) is the Tribal identity of Rai and its a symbol of unity of different diviersified Kirati Rai in one ethnic family. Teen Chula(Suptulung)also known as Samkhalung in bantawa Rai dialect The word &quot;Samkha&quot; means ancestors and &quot;Lung&quot; means stones. Samkhalung the three main stones,
# Papalung: symbolizing male ancestors,
# Mamalung: symbolizing female ancestors, and
# Ramilung: symbolizing societal spiritual energies.
The Teen Chula are considered by the Rai to be their most important shrines Teen Chula is sacred place after death where the departed souls ancestors of the Rai live in this place. Teen Chula philosophy (three knowledge perspectives) as the distinctive original identity of Rai.

=== Folk gods and goddesses ===
Kirati Rai are basically animist they worship various Household deity and Nature deities.

Kirati Rai worship as ancestral god and goddess to Sumnima and Paruhang. Sumnima also known as &#x27;Hengkhamma&#x27; the Mother Earth and Paruhang also known as &#x27;Ninamma&#x27; Father the Sky god. The Sumnima is the supreme female God, wife of the Paruhang She represents the earth and ancestral mother. Paruhang is the supreme male God, husband of the Sumnima, lords of flowers. Sumnima-Paruhang are the deities of creator, preserver and sustainer god and goddess of the Rai. These deities are sometimes conflated with the Shaivist deities of Nepalese Hinduism, primarily Shiva and Parvati, although they are distinct in origin.

=== Rai shamanism ===

Rai shamanism comprises a plurality of shamanic traditions, varied but closely related, like the Rai groups themselves. The Rai in East Nepal consist of numerous subtribes, and even though they speak different languages and have their own distinct traditions, they all share a common linguistic and cultural heritage. Together with Limbu (the language of a related group residing farther to the east, also in Sikkim and Darjeeling), the Kirati Rai languages belong to the Kiranti family, which is a subgroup of Tibeto-Burman. Culturally the Rai have been influenced by both Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism, but these influences have only marginally affected their ancestral traditions, in which shamanic features still figure prominently.

=== The Mundum ===
The &quot;mundum&quot; is the oral tradition among the Rai and it is also a long-standing, and ancient, though not unchanging, ritual practice. Mundum is also addressed as &quot;Ridum&quot; &quot;Muddum&quot; or &quot;Pelam&quot;. Iiterally, &quot;Muna&quot; means &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;dum&quot; means talk&quot; which can be said speaking of man or oral talking as a hole the mundum is an oral tradition. so, it may differ in place to place. The term mundum is generally pronounced as mundhum by Nepali speakers. Many researchers have documented the term mundhum in their research. The /dh/ sound in mundum is not found in many Kirati languages. If it is found in other Kirati languages, it often is a loan sound. The term mundhum thus might be of Nepali influence. So, the native term is &quot;mundhum”. In this case, the term mundum changes into the mundhum because the alveolar is changed into the dental aspirated /dh/ because it might be the influence of the Nepali language. Although, the concept is the same, the term mundum has different variants among different subgroups of Rai. Gaenszle (2002: 40–42), who has done pioneering work in the field of Kirati ritual, has extensively studied about it and collected different terms, which are as follows:

* Mundhum: Chintang, Bantawa, Belhare
* Muddum/Mudum: Mewahang, Bantawa, Sampang
* Mindum/Pe-lam: Yamphu
* Ridum: Kulung
* Mundum : Chamling
* Pe-lam: Lohorung

== Rai tribes and clans ==
Rai have distinct cultural tradition. The community is divided into different subtribes called &quot;Thar&quot; all have their own distinctive language or dialect this division of Rai into various subtribes allows for the minor alterations in the ritualistic practices while the essence of the traditions remains homogeneous largely. within the &quot;Thar&quot; there are clan division called &quot;Pacha&quot;(pa=papa/father and cha=children). clans are exogamous. There is further classification within the Pacha known as &quot;Samet&quot;. Samet traces the relationship of a person to his/her ancestor. Pacha and Samet is main ritual identity of Rai, which is compulsory needed in every ritual performance.

== Languages ==
The Rai languages are members of the Sino-Tibetan language family. They belong to the Kiranti group of the Tibeto-Burman languages branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. In the Nepal National Census of 2011, roughly 800,000 respondents declared a Kiranti languages as their &quot;mother tongue&quot;. The number of speakers is probably less than this. The Census of India (2001) reported 50,000 speakers of Limbu and Rai in India (most in Sikkim) Linguistic Survey of India n.d.).

== Festivals ==
===Sakela===
Sakela is the gathering of Rai people for the celebration of Udhauli and Ubhauli. Sakela is actually affiliated with Chamling people of Kirati Rai community. Since the identity of different groups of Rai are at depleting, many Rai are taking Sakela as the main festival of Rai. However, truth remains that Sakela is a dance performed during Udhauli and Ubhauli while Rai people gather together. The Rai people (Chamling group) call it by different names like Sakenwa, Sakela, Tosh or Toshi, Bhume, Sakel, Wass, Segro, Sakewa, Dhuulu, Phagulak, Gelang, Gayapuja among different linguistic groups. This event is performed for 15–15 days in a year as ubhauli(Dhirinam) in full moon day of the Baisakh and udhauli(Chhirinam), in full moon day of Mangsir in Kirati Rai villages.

The major philosophy of Sakela is nature worship; importance is placed on paying tribute to ancestors to whom current generations owe their existence. Since Kirati people consider themselves the followers of the nature, they celebrate Udhauli and Ubhauli with sakela to worship sky, earth, rivers, and forest on the one hand; they pay tribute towards the deceased members of their family on the other hand.

During , the dance known as is performed. varies from village to village in the beating of jhyamta cymbals and dhol. The choreography of depicts important daily activities, and explains the traditional origins of agricultural practices such as digging, tilling, weeding and farming cotton. Likewise, the imitation of the birds and animals is also performed in lively .

Farming is the main occupation of the majority of Rai people. Mostly they cultivate maize, millet, wheat, mustard in dry terraces, and rice in the wet fields. The grains grown are mostly for their own daily needs such as to use in festivals and to feed the animals. Besides that they use it to make spirits and beer for consumption and some sell at the bazar at the local market. In almost all households women Raise buffalo, pigs and chickens, and they run tiny provision stores for supplementary income, especially used to sell homemade beer and alcohol (Lee, 2005:16).

In the past Rai people were into hunting and they liked to use bow and arrows, and they used to weave their own clothes made from Bhangra (allo) to wear.

But in the modern times significant number of Rai are also employed in foreign military service and in foreign employment, like the Indian Gorkha Regiment, British Gurkha Regiment, Gurkha Contingent of Singapore Police. Along with their relatives they have had the opportunity to work and live abroad in countries like United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brunei and India. Because of that financially, compared to some other indigenous groups, they are relatively better off.

Some Rai have reached top national level Political, bureaucratic, academic and Diplomatic positions( see Notable Rai people below)

Traditionally daily housework, such as cooking is the responsibility of the young women, especially girls. They tend to be the ones who gather firewood from the forests and carry water from the communal water sources while men are mostly involved in the agriculture activities.

In the past Kirati Rai people used to use the land under the Kipat system where the people exercised communal rights over the land; land that was tax free and included dominion over all cultivated lands, forests, streams and rivers within its bounds (Bista, 1967:38). Under the Kipat system other ethnic groups had to pay tax to the Rai owners of the land. People used to farm their land on their own, seldom were fields rented or cultivated by anyone others than the owners.

Almost every single Rai village has a few soldiers, police or civil servants and older pensioners. Because of their bravery, fearlessness, honesty and straightforward nature it&#x27;s easy for them to join the armies. Nowadays many Rai are also working with the government services too; some holding high ranks and positions (ibid: 39). These types of professions really show the Rai people as a hard working people.

The planting and harvesting seasons from spring to autumn gives them plenty of work to do and in winter time villagers make trips towards the important towns to buy necessary goods such as salt, oil and materials for clothing. They carry goods for trade rather than money on these trips. One farmer may have several fields and they shift from one to another according to the seasons. Traditional Bullocks are used for ploughing the land, the grass and dry undergrowth are burned away, supplying the soil with ash residue (ibid: 38). A majority of the people are in debt, the usual practice for money transaction to be made against security in the land.

<text>Wilhelm F. Rabe (1893–1958) was a German astronomer. He worked at the Bogenhausen Observatory, being its director from 1935 until 1946.

He was a talented observer, and was one of the first to trace unexplained errors when obtaining vertical positions of stars to the deflection of the telescope tube. He extensively studied binary stars and was recognized for this work.

The Martian crater &quot;Rabe&quot; was named in his honor.

<doc id="997014" wikidata="Q437168" url="?curid=997014" title="Jeanne Baret">
<text>Jeanne Baret (; 27 July 1740 – 5 August 1807) is recognised as the first woman to have completed a voyage of circumnavigation of the globe, which she did via maritime transport. A key part of her journey was as a member of Louis Antoine de Bougainville&#x27;s expedition on the ships &quot;La Boudeuse&quot; and &quot;Étoile&quot; in 1766–1769.

Jeanne Baret joined the expedition disguised as a man, calling herself Jean Baret. She enlisted as valet and assistant to the expedition&#x27;s naturalist, Philibert Commerçon (anglicized as Commerson), shortly before Bougainville&#x27;s ships sailed from France. According to Bougainville&#x27;s account, Baret was an expert botanist.

== Early life ==
Jeanne Baret was born on 27 July 1740, in the village of La Comelle in the Burgundy region of France, and baptized the next day. Her record of baptism survives and identifies her as the legitimate issue of Jean Baret and Jeanne Pochard. Her father is identified as a day laborer and is likely to have been illiterate. Her mother died in November 1741 (according to the parish records at the age of 45); her father then married Antoinette Mangematin, who died in 1745, and then Jeanne Teuvenot, who died in 1747 at the age of 40. Baret&#x27;s father died in December 1755; the register of his death and burial mentions a son Pierre Baret (born 1734) as well as a son-in-law, indicating that Jeanne Baret had a brother and a sister. Overall, next to nothing is known of Baret&#x27;s childhood or young adulthood, and she does not reappear in official records until 1764. Her biographer Danielle Clode speculates that she lived with her sister&#x27;s family in Rosières, close to Toulon-sur-Arroux. It is unknown how Baret obtained an education, but she learned to write by 1764 as evidenced by her signature on an official document.

== Relationship with Commerson ==

At some point between 1760 and 1764, Baret became employed as housekeeper to Commerson, who had settled in Toulon-sur-Arroux, some to the south of La Comelle, upon his marriage in 1760. Commerson&#x27;s wife, who was the sister of the parish priest, died shortly after giving birth to a son in April 1762, and it seems most likely that Baret took over management of Commerson&#x27;s household at that time, if not before.

It is also evident that Baret and Commerson shared a more personal relationship, as Baret became pregnant in 1764. French law at that time required women who became pregnant out of wedlock to obtain a &quot;certificate of pregnancy&quot; in which they could name the father of their unborn child. Baret&#x27;s certificate, from August 1764, survives; it was filed in a town away and witnessed by two men of substance who likewise had travelled a considerable distance from their homes. She refused to name the father of her child, but historians do not doubt that it was Commerson and that it was Commerson who had also made the arrangements with the lawyer and witnesses on her behalf.

Shortly afterwards, Baret and Commerson moved together to Paris, where she continued in the role of his housekeeper. Baret apparently used the name &quot;Jeanne de Bonnefoy&quot; during this period. Her child, born in December 1764, was given the name Jean-Pierre Baret. Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died in the summer of 1765. (Commerson had left his legitimate son from his marriage in the care of his brother-in-law in Toulon-sur-Arroux and never saw him again in his lifetime.) A second son, Aimé Eugène Prosper Bonnefoy, was born at the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris in May 1766. The fate of this child is unknown but he appears to have died before 1775.

In 1765, Commerson was invited to join Bougainville&#x27;s expedition. He hesitated in accepting because he was often in poor health; he required Baret&#x27;s assistance as a nurse as well as in running his household and managing his collections and papers. His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time. At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived. To avoid scrutiny, she was to join the expedition immediately before the ship sailed, pretending to be a stranger to Commerson.

Before leaving Paris, Commerson drew up a will in which he left to &quot;Jeanne Baret, known as de Bonnefoi, my housekeeper&quot;, a lump sum of 600 livres along with back wages owed and the furnishings of their Paris apartment. Thus, while the story Baret concocted for Bougainville&#x27;s benefit to explain her presence on board ship was carefully designed to shield Commerson from involvement, there is clear documentary evidence of their previous relationship, and it is highly improbable that Commerson was not complicit in the plan himself.

== With Bougainville ==
Baret and Commerson joined the Bougainville expedition at the port of Rochefort in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the &quot;Étoile&quot;. Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship&#x27;s captain, François Chenard de la Giraudais, gave up his large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his &quot;assistant&quot;. This gave Baret significantly more privacy than she would have had otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain&#x27;s cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared head with other members of the crew.
In addition to Bougainville&#x27;s published account, Baret&#x27;s story figures in three other surviving memoirs of the expedition: a journal kept jointly by Commerson and Pierre Duclos-Guyot; a journal by the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, a paying passenger on the &quot;Boudeuse&quot;; and a memoir by François Vivès, a surgeon on the &quot;Étoile&quot;. Vivès has the most to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.

Commerson suffered badly from both seasickness and a recurring ulcer on his leg in the early part of the voyage, and Baret probably spent most of her time attending to him. Aside from the ceremony of &quot;crossing the line&quot;, which Commerson described in some detail in his memoir, there was little for the botanists to do until the &quot;Étoile&quot; reached Montevideo. There they set out on expeditions to the surrounding plains and mountains. Commerson&#x27;s leg was still troubling him, and Baret seems to have done much of the actual labour, carrying supplies and specimens. In Rio de Janeiro – a much more dangerous place, where the &quot;Étoile&quot;″s chaplain was murdered ashore soon after their arrival – Commerson was officially confined to the ship while his leg healed, but he and Baret nonetheless collected specimens of a flowering vine, which he named &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;.

After a second visit to Montevideo, their next opportunity to collect plants was in Patagonia while the ships of the expedition were waiting for favourable winds to carry them through the Strait of Magellan. Here Baret accompanied Commerson on the most troublesome excursions over rugged terrain and gained a reputation for courage and strength. Commerson, still hampered by his leg injury, referred to Baret as his &quot;beast of burden&quot; on these expeditions. In addition to the manual labour she performed in collecting plants, stones, and shells, Baret also helped Commerson organize and catalogue their specimens and notes in the weeks that followed, as the ships entered the Pacific. 

Surviving accounts of the expedition differ on when Baret&#x27;s sex was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumours that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her sex was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried out that she was a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the &quot;Étoile&quot; to interview Baret personally.

In his account, Vivès reports much speculation about Baret&#x27;s sex early in the voyage and asserts that Baret claimed to be a eunuch when confronted directly by La Giraudais (whose own official log has not survived). Bougainville&#x27;s account of Baret&#x27;s unmasking on Tahiti is not corroborated by the other journal accounts of the expedition, although Vivès describes a similar incident in which Baret was immediately pointed out as a woman by the Tahitian Ahu-toru on board the ship. Vivès also describes a different incident on New Ireland in mid-July in which Baret was caught off-guard, stripped, and &quot;examined&quot; by a group of other servants on the expedition. Duclos-Guyot and Nassau-Siegen also recorded that Baret had been discovered to be a woman in New Ireland, but without mentioning details.

Ahu-toru travelled back to France with the expedition and was subsequently questioned at some length about Baret. Modern scholars now believe that Ahu-toru thought that Baret was a transvestite, or &quot;mahu&quot;. However, other Tahitian natives reported the presence of a woman in Bougainville&#x27;s expedition to later visitors to the island, including James Cook in 1769 and Domingo de Bonechea in 1772, which indicates that her sex was known to the Tahitians if not to her shipmates at the time she visited the island.

After crossing the Pacific, the expedition was desperately short of food. After a brief stop for supplies in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), the ships made a longer stop at the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This island, then known as Isle de France, was an important French trading station. Commerson was delighted to find that his old friend and fellow botanist Pierre Poivre was serving as governor on the island, and Commerson and Baret remained behind as Poivre&#x27;s guests. Bougainville probably also actively encouraged this arrangement, as it allowed him to rid himself of the problem of a woman illegally onboard his expedition.

On Mauritius, Baret continued in her role as Commerson&#x27;s assistant and housekeeper. She likely accompanied him in plant-collecting on Madagascar and Bourbon Island in 1770–1772. Commerson continued to have serious health problems, and he died in Mauritius in February 1773. His financial resources had dwindled during his time on the island: his patron Poivre had been recalled to Paris. Baret, meanwhile, seems to have established herself independently, being granted property in Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius, in 1770.

==Later life==
After Commerson&#x27;s death, Baret ran a tavern in Port Louis. She was fined 50 livres for serving alcohol on Sundays in 1773. Then, on 17 May 1774, she married Jean Dubernat, a non-commissioned officer in the French Army who was most likely on the island on his way home to France. Jeanne brought a small fortune to her marriage, presumably from the tavern and perhaps other business ventures she ran on the island.

There is no record of exactly when Baret and her husband arrived in France, thus completing her voyage of circumnavigation. Most likely it was sometime in 1775. In April 1776, she received the money that was due to her under Commerson&#x27;s will after applying directly to the Attorney General. With this money, she settled with Dubernat in his native village of Saint-Aulaye, Dordogne where they bought property with Jeanne&#x27;s wealth and lived with both Dubernat&#x27;s and Jeanne&#x27;s nieces and nephews.

In 1785, Baret was granted a pension of 200 livres a year by the Ministry of Marine. The document granting her this pension makes clear the high regard with which she was held by this point:

Jeanne Barré, by means of a disguise, circumnavigated the globe on one of the vessels commanded by Mr de Bougainville. She devoted herself in particular to assisting Mr de Commerson, doctor and botanist, and shared with great courage the labours and dangers of this savant. Her behaviour was exemplary and Mr de Bougainville refers to it with all due credit... His Lordship has been gracious enough to grant to this extraordinary woman a pension of two hundred livres a year to be drawn from the fund for invalid servicemen and this pension shall be payable from 1 January 1785.

She died in Saint-Aulaye on 5 August 1807, at the age of 67.

== Legacy and controversy ==

Commerson named many of the plants he collected after friends and acquaintances. One of them, a tall shrub with dark green leaves and white flowers that he found on Madagascar, he named &quot;Baretia bonafidia&quot;. But Commerson&#x27;s name for this genus did not survive, as it had already been named by the time his reports reached Paris; it is currently known as &quot;Turraea&quot;. While over seventy species are named in honor of Commerson, only one, &quot;Solanum baretiae&quot;, honors Baret. In December 2023, Martín E. Timaná published a description of &quot;Baretia lanata&quot;, a species in the new genus &quot;Baretia&quot; in the &quot;Caryophyllaceae&quot; family of flowering plants, named in honor of Baret. As of December 2024, the name is considered unplaced.

The New York Botanical Garden includes a plant specimen, attributed to Commerson but believed to be collected by Baret with him, in their herbarium.

Jeanne Baret is referred to in Amitav Ghosh&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot;: The fictional character Paulette Lambert identifies &quot;Philippe and Jeanne Commerson&quot; as her &quot;grand-uncle and grand-aunt&quot;.

In 2018, the International Astronomical Union named a mountain range on Pluto for her.

For many years, Bougainville&#x27;s published journal – a popular bestseller in its day, in the original French as well as in English translations – was the only widely available source of information about Baret. More recent scholarship has uncovered additional facts and documentation about her life, but much of the new information remained little-known and inaccessible to the general public, particularly outside France. The first English-language biography of Baret, by John Dunmore, was not published until 2002, and then only in New Zealand. Other articles appeared only in scholarly journals.

The 2010 biography of Baret by Glynis Ridley, &quot;The Discovery of Jeanne Baret&quot;, brought Baret to the attention of a wider audience and helped to overturn some of the old misconceptions about her life. However, Ridley&#x27;s biography has also been highly criticized by some reviewers for its reliance on improbable chains of speculation that are not corroborated by any other primary or secondary sources. New research by French researchers has provided clearer archival information on Jeanne Baret&#x27;s life, as has a new biography by Danielle Clode, &quot;In Search of the Woman who Sailed the World&quot;, published in 2020. On 27 July 2020, Google celebrated her 280th birthday with a Google Doodle.

Jeanne Barret was one of the 10 inspirational French women celebrated as golden statues rising out of the River Seine during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

<text>Mount Owen is in the Tasman District of the South Island of New Zealand. It stands at 1875 metres (6150 feet) above sea level and is part of the Marino Mountains. Mount Owen is the tallest mountain found in Kahurangi National Park.

There are a number of caves in the marble karst areas on the flanks of the mountain, including New Zealand&#x27;s longest cave system, Bulmer Cavern, which run for 64 kilometres. Mount Owen lies within Kahurangi National Park. The Hope Saddle crosses its eastern flank.

Mount Owen featured briefly in the first of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. When the characters led by Aragorn leave Moria they emerge onto a rocky plateau. This was filmed on the slopes of Mount Owen.

Mount Owen is best accessed via Granity Pass. This generally involves a two-day tramp staying overnight at Granity Pass Hut. It is possible to climb it in winter but care is needed over the karst area due to snow hiding sink holes.

<doc id="997020" wikidata="Q3525012" url="?curid=997020" title="Thomas Creech">
<text>Thomas Creech (1659 – found dead 19 July 1700) was an English translator of classical works, and headmaster of Sherborne School. Creech translated Lucretius into verse in 1682, for which he received a Fellowship at Oxford. He also produced English versions of Manilius, Horace, Theocritus, and other classics.

==Life==
He was born at Blandford Forum, Dorset. His father, also called Thomas Creech, died in 1720, and his mother, Jane Creech, died in 1693; they had two children, Thomas the translator and one daughter Bridget, who married Thomas Bastard, an architect of Blandford, and had issue six sons and four daughters. Creech&#x27;s parents were not rich. His classical training was due to Thomas Curgenven, rector of Folke in Dorset, but best known as master of Sherborne school, to whom Creech afterwards dedicated his translation of the seventh idyll of Theocritus, and to whom he acknowledged his debt in the preface to his translation of Horace. His education was supported from Colonel Strangways, a member of a well-known county family.

In Lent term 1675 Creech was admitted as a commoner at Wadham College, Oxford, and placed under the tuition of Robert Pitt. Creech&#x27;s translation of one of the idylls of Theocritus is inscribed to his &quot;chum Mr. Hody of Wadham College&quot;, and another is dedicated to Robert Balch, who at a later date was his &quot;friend and tutor&quot;. Two of his letters are printed in &quot;Evelyn&#x27;s Diary&quot;. He was elected a scholar of his college 28 September 1676, and took degrees: B.A. 27 October 1680, M.A. 13 June 1683, and B.D. 18 March 1696. He was a reputed scholar, and one of the first to benefit by William Sancroft&#x27;s reforms in the elections for fellowships at All Souls&#x27; College, where he was elected a fellow in 1683.

For two years (1694–6) he was the headmaster of Sherborne School, but he then returned to Oxford, where a strangeness of manner was noticed in 1698. He accepted the college living of Welwyn, to which he was instituted 25 April 1699, but never entered into residence. After he had been missing for five days he was discovered (in July 1700) to have committed suicide in a garret in the house of Mr. Ives, an apothecary, with whom he lodged. He had wished to marry Miss Philadelphia Playdell of St. Giles, Oxford, but her friends would not consent to the marriage. In his will, dated 18 January 1699, and proved 28 June 1700, he divided his means into two parts, one of which he left to his sister Bridget Bastard for the use of his father during his lifetime and afterwards for herself, while he left the other moiety to Miss Playdell and appointed her sole executrix. She later married Ralph Hobson, butler of Christ Church, Oxford, and died in 1706, aged 34. He was also short of money.

There were printed after his death two tracts:

* &quot;A Step to Oxford, or a Mad Essay on the Reverend Mr. Tho. Creech&#x27;s hanging himself (as &#x27;tis said) for love. With the Character of his Mistress&quot;, 1700. 
* &quot;Daphnis, or a Pastoral Elegy upon the unfortunate and much-lamented death of Mr. Thomas Creech&quot;, 1700; second edition (corrected) 1701, and it is also found in ‘A Collection of the best English Poetry,’ vol. i. 1717.

His portrait, three-quarters oval in a clerical habit, was given by Humphrey Bartholomew to the picture gallery at Oxford. It was engraved by R. White and also by Van der Gucht.

==Works==
Creech&#x27;s 1682 translation of Lucretius vied in popularity with John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Virgil&quot; and Alexander Pope&#x27;s Homer. A second edition appeared in the following year with extra commendatory verses in Latin and English, some of which bore the names of Nahum Tate, Thomas Otway, Aphra Behn, Richard Duke, and Edmund Waller; and when Dryden published his translations from Theocritus, Lucretius, and Horace, he made flattering comments on Creech&#x27;s work in the preface. Creech&#x27;s Lucretius was often reprinted, and was included in the edition of the British poets which was issued by Robert Anderson. An edition appeared in 1714 containing translations of verses previously omitted and numerous notes from another hand designed to set forth a complete system of Epicurean philosophy.

The success of his translation of Lucretius induced Creech to undertake an edition of the original work. It appeared in 1695 with the title &#x27;Titi Lucretii Cari de rerum natura libri sex, quibus interpretationem et notas addidit Thomas Creech,&#x27; and was dedicated to his friend Christopher Codrington. This edition was also often republished, in particular at Glasgow in 1753. Creech&#x27;s agreement with Abel Swalle for the preparation of this volume is among the Ballard MSS. at the Bodleian Library. H. A. J. Munro in his edition of Lucretius wrote of Creech as borrowing annotations mainly from Lambinus, attributing the popularity of the work to their clarity and brevity.

In 1684 Creech published &#x27;The Odes, Satyrs, and Epistles of Horace. Done into English;&#x27; it was reprinted in the same year, and again in 1688, 1715, 1720, and 1737. Other translations by Creech consisted of:

* Several elegies from Ovid with the second and third eclogues of Virgil in a collection of &#x27;Miscellany Poems,&#x27; 1684. 
* Laconick Apothegms, or remarkable sayings of the Spartans in &#x27;Plutarch&#x27;s Morals,&#x27; 1684, vol. i. pt. iii. 135–204; a Discourse concerning Socrates his Demon, ib. ii. pt. vi. 1–59; the first two books of the Symposiacks, ib. ii. pt. vi. 61–144, iii. pt. viii. 139–418. 
* Lives of Solon, Pelopidas, and Cleomenes in &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s Lives&quot;, 1683–6, 5 vols., an edition often reprinted in the first half of the eighteenth century.
* Idylliums of Theocritus, with Rapin&#x27;s discourse of Pastorals, done into English, 1684, and reprinted in 1721, which was dedicated to Arthur Charlett.
* The thirteenth Satire of Juvenal, with notes, in the translation &#x27;by Mr. Dryden and other eminent hands,&#x27; 1693. 
* Verses of Santolius Victorinus, prefixed to &#x27;The compleat Gard&#x27;ner of de la Quintinye, made English by John Evelyn,&#x27; 1693. 
* The five books of M. Manilius containing a system of the ancient astronomy and astrology, done into English verse, with notes, 1697.
* Life of Pelopidas in the &#x27;Lives of Illustrious Men&#x27; by Cornelius Nepos, translated by the Hon. Mr. Finch, Mr. Creech, and others, 1713.

Creech was engaged at the time of his death on an edition of Justin Martyr.

<text>The asymptotic gain model (also known as the Rosenstark method) is a representation of the gain of negative feedback amplifiers given by the asymptotic gain relation:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the return ratio with the input source disabled (equal to the negative of the loop gain in the case of a single-loop system composed of unilateral blocks), &quot;G∞&quot; is the asymptotic gain and &quot;G0&quot; is the direct transmission term. This form for the gain can provide intuitive insight into the circuit and often is easier to derive than a direct attack on the gain.

Figure 1 shows a block diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression. The asymptotic gain relation also can be expressed as a signal flow graph. See Figure 2. The asymptotic gain model is a special case of the extra element theorem.


As follows directly from limiting cases of the gain expression, the asymptotic gain &quot;G∞&quot; is simply the gain of the system when the return ratio approaches infinity:
:formula_3

while the direct transmission term &quot;G0&quot; is the gain of the system when the return ratio is zero:
:formula_4

==Advantages==
* This model is useful because it completely characterizes feedback amplifiers, including loading effects and the bilateral properties of amplifiers and feedback networks.
* Often feedback amplifiers are designed such that the return ratio &quot;T&quot; is much greater than unity. In this case, and assuming the direct transmission term &quot;G0&quot; is small (as it often is), the gain &quot;G&quot; of the system is approximately equal to the asymptotic gain &quot;G∞&quot;.
* The asymptotic gain is (usually) only a function of passive elements in a circuit, and can often be found by inspection.
* The feedback topology (series-series, series-shunt, etc.) need not be identified beforehand as the analysis is the same in all cases.

==Implementation==
Direct application of the model involves these steps:
# Select a dependent source in the circuit.
# Find the return ratio for that source.
# Find the gain &quot;G∞&quot; directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to &quot;T&quot; = ∞.
# Find the gain &quot; G0&quot; directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to &quot;T&quot; = 0.
# Substitute the values for &quot;T, G∞&quot; and &quot; G0&quot; into the asymptotic gain formula.

These steps can be implemented directly in SPICE using the small-signal circuit of hand analysis. In this approach the dependent sources of the devices are readily accessed. In contrast, for experimental measurements using real devices or SPICE simulations using numerically generated device models with inaccessible dependent sources, evaluating the return ratio requires special methods.

==Connection with classical feedback theory==
Classical feedback theory neglects feedforward (&quot;G&quot;0). If feedforward is dropped, the gain from the asymptotic gain model becomes

::formula_5

while in classical feedback theory, in terms of the open loop gain &quot;A&quot;, the gain with feedback (closed loop gain) is:

::formula_6

Comparison of the two expressions indicates the feedback factor &quot;β&quot;FB is:

::formula_7

while the open-loop gain is:

::formula_8

If the accuracy is adequate (usually it is), these formulas suggest an alternative evaluation of &quot;T&quot;: evaluate the open-loop gain and &quot;G∞&quot; and use these expressions to find &quot;T&quot;. Often these two evaluations are easier than evaluation of &quot;T&quot; directly.

==Examples==
The steps in deriving the gain using the asymptotic gain formula are outlined below for two negative feedback amplifiers. The single transistor example shows how the method works in principle for a transconductance amplifier, while the second two-transistor example shows the approach to more complex cases using a current amplifier.

===Single-stage transistor amplifier===

Consider the simple FET feedback amplifier in Figure 3. The aim is to find the low-frequency, open-circuit, transresistance gain of this circuit &quot;G&quot; = &quot;v&quot;out / &quot;i&quot;in using the asymptotic gain model.


The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4, where the transistor is replaced by its hybrid-pi model.

====Return ratio====
It is most straightforward to begin by finding the return ratio &quot;T&quot;, because &quot;G0&quot; and &quot;G∞&quot; are defined as limiting forms of the gain as &quot;T&quot; tends to either zero or infinity. To take these limits, it is necessary to know what parameters &quot;T&quot; depends upon. There is only one dependent source in this circuit, so as a starting point the return ratio related to this source is determined as outlined in the article on return ratio.

The return ratio is found using Figure 5. In Figure 5, the input current source is set to zero, By cutting the dependent source out of the output side of the circuit, and short-circuiting its terminals, the output side of the circuit is isolated from the input and the feedback loop is broken. A test current &quot;it&quot; replaces the dependent source. Then the return current generated in the dependent source by the test current is found. The return ratio is then &quot;T&quot; = −&quot;ir / it&quot;. Using this method, and noticing that &quot;R&quot;D is in parallel with &quot;r&quot;O, &quot;T&quot; is determined as:
:formula_9
where the approximation is accurate in the common case where &quot;r&quot;O » &quot;R&quot;D. With this relationship it is clear that the limits &quot;T&quot; → 0, or ∞ are realized if we let transconductance &quot;g&quot;m → 0, or ∞.

====Asymptotic gain====
Finding the asymptotic gain &quot;G∞&quot; provides insight, and usually can be done by inspection. To find &quot;G∞&quot; we let &quot;g&quot;m → ∞ and find the resulting gain. The drain current, &quot;i&quot;D = &quot;g&quot;m &quot;v&quot;GS, must be finite. Hence, as &quot;g&quot;m approaches infinity, &quot;v&quot;GS also must approach zero. As the source is grounded, &quot;v&quot;GS = 0 implies &quot;v&quot;G = 0 as well. With &quot;v&quot;G = 0 and the fact that all the input current flows through &quot;R&quot;f (as the FET has an infinite input impedance), the output voltage is simply −&quot;i&quot;in &quot;R&quot;f. Hence

:formula_10

Alternatively &quot;G∞&quot; is the gain found by replacing the transistor by an ideal amplifier with infinite gain - a nullor.

====Direct feedthrough====
To find the direct feedthrough formula_11 we simply let &quot;gm&quot; → 0 and compute the resulting gain. The currents through &quot;R&quot;f and the parallel combination of &quot;R&quot;D || &quot;r&quot;O must therefore be the same and equal to &quot;i&quot;in. The output voltage is therefore &quot;i&quot;in &quot;(R&quot;D &quot;|| r&quot;O&quot;)&quot;.

Hence
:formula_12

where the approximation is accurate in the common case where &quot;rO&quot; » &quot;RD&quot;.

====Overall gain====
The overall transresistance gain of this amplifier is therefore:

:formula_13

Examining this equation, it appears to be advantageous to make &quot;RD&quot; large in order make the overall gain approach the asymptotic gain, which makes the gain insensitive to amplifier parameters (&quot;gm&quot; and &quot;RD&quot;). In addition, a large first term reduces the importance of the direct feedthrough factor, which degrades the amplifier. One way to increase &quot;RD&quot; is to replace this resistor by an active load, for example, a current mirror.
===Two-stage transistor amplifier===

Figure 6 shows a two-transistor amplifier with a feedback resistor &quot;Rf&quot;. This amplifier is often referred to as a &quot;shunt-series feedback&quot; amplifier, and analyzed on the basis that resistor &quot;R2&quot; is in series with the output and samples output current, while &quot;Rf&quot; is in shunt (parallel) with the input and subtracts from the input current. See the article on negative feedback amplifier and references by Meyer or Sedra. That is, the amplifier uses current feedback. It frequently is ambiguous just what type of feedback is involved in an amplifier, and the asymptotic gain approach has the advantage/disadvantage that it works whether or not you understand the circuit.

Figure 6 indicates the output node, but does not indicate the choice of output variable. In what follows, the output variable is selected as the short-circuit current of the amplifier, that is, the collector current of the output transistor. Other choices for output are discussed later.

To implement the asymptotic gain model, the dependent source associated with either transistor can be used. Here the first transistor is chosen.

====Return ratio====
The circuit to determine the return ratio is shown in the top panel of Figure 7. Labels show the currents in the various branches as found using a combination of Ohm&#x27;s law and Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws. Resistor &quot;R&quot;1 &quot;= R&quot;B &quot;// r&quot;π1 and &quot;R&quot;3 &quot;= R&quot;C2 &quot;// R&quot;L. KVL from the ground of &quot;R&quot;1 to the ground of &quot;R&quot;2 provides:

:formula_14

KVL provides the collector voltage at the top of &quot;RC&quot; as

:formula_15

Finally, KCL at this collector provides

:formula_16

Substituting the first equation into the second and the second into the third, the return ratio is found as

:formula_17
:::formula_18

====Gain &quot;G0&quot; with T = 0====
The circuit to determine &quot;G0&quot; is shown in the center panel of Figure 7. In Figure 7, the output variable is the output current β&quot;iB&quot; (the short-circuit load current), which leads to the short-circuit current gain of the amplifier, namely β&quot;iB&quot; / &quot;i&quot;S:

::formula_19

Using Ohm&#x27;s law, the voltage at the top of &quot;R1&quot; is found as

::formula_20

or, rearranging terms,

::formula_21

Using KCL at the top of &quot;R2&quot;:

::formula_22

Emitter voltage &quot;vE&quot; already is known in terms of &quot;iB&quot; from the diagram of Figure 7. Substituting the second equation in the first, &quot;iB&quot; is determined in terms of &quot;iS&quot; alone, and &quot;G0&quot; becomes:

::formula_23

Gain &quot;G0&quot; represents feedforward through the feedback network, and commonly is negligible.

====Gain &quot;G∞&quot; with &quot;T&quot; → ∞====
The circuit to determine &quot;G∞&quot; is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7. The introduction of the ideal op amp (a nullor) in this circuit is explained as follows. When &quot;T &quot;→ ∞, the gain of the amplifier goes to infinity as well, and in such a case the differential voltage driving the amplifier (the voltage across the input transistor &quot;rπ1&quot;) is driven to zero and (according to Ohm&#x27;s law when there is no voltage) it draws no input current. On the other hand, the output current and output voltage are whatever the circuit demands. This behavior is like a nullor, so a nullor can be introduced to represent the infinite gain transistor.

The current gain is read directly off the schematic:

::formula_24

====Comparison with classical feedback theory====
Using the classical model, the feed-forward is neglected and the feedback factor βFB is (assuming transistor β » 1):

::formula_25

and the open-loop gain &quot;A&quot; is:

::formula_26

====Overall gain====
The above expressions can be substituted into the asymptotic gain model equation to find the overall gain G. The resulting gain is the &quot;current&quot; gain of the amplifier with a short-circuit load.

=====Gain using alternative output variables=====
In the amplifier of Figure 6, &quot;R&quot;L and &quot;R&quot;C2 are in parallel.
To obtain the transresistance gain, say &quot;A&quot;ρ, that is, the gain using voltage as output variable, the short-circuit current gain &quot;G&quot; is multiplied by &quot;RC2 // RL&quot; in accordance with Ohm&#x27;s law:

::formula_27

The &quot;open-circuit&quot; voltage gain is found from &quot;A&quot;ρ by setting &quot;R&quot;L → ∞.

To obtain the current gain when load current &quot;iL&quot; in load resistor &quot;R&quot;L is the output variable, say &quot;A&quot;i, the formula for current division is used: &quot;iL = iout × RC2 / ( RC2 + RL )&quot; and the short-circuit current gain &quot;G&quot; is multiplied by this loading factor:

::formula_28

Of course, the short-circuit current gain is recovered by setting &quot;R&quot;L = 0 Ω.

<text>Dux (, : &quot;ducēs&quot;) is Latin for &quot;leader&quot; (from the noun &quot;dux, ducis&quot;, &quot;leader, general&quot;) and later for duke and its variant forms (doge, duce, etc.). During the Roman Republic and for the first centuries of the Roman Empire, &quot;dux&quot; could refer to anyone who commanded troops, both Roman generals and foreign leaders, but was not a formal military rank.

==Roman Empire==

===Original usage===
Until the 3rd century, &quot;dux&quot; was not a formal expression of rank within the Roman military or administrative hierarchy.

In the Roman army, a &quot;dux&quot; would be a general in charge of two or more legions. While the title of &quot;dux&quot; could refer to a consul or imperator, it usually refers to the Roman governor of the provinces. 

In writing his commentaries on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar uses the term only for Celtic generals, with one exception for a Roman commander who held no official rank.

=== Change in usage ===
By the mid-3rd century AD, it had acquired a more precise connotation defining the commander of an expeditionary force, usually made up of detachments (i.e., &quot;vexillationes&quot;) from one or more of the regular military formations. Such appointments were made to deal with specific military situations when the threat to be countered seemed beyond the capabilities of the province-based military command structure that had characterised the Roman army of the High Empire.

From the time of Gallienus onwards for more than a century they were invariably &quot;Viri Perfectissimi&quot;, i.e., members of the second class of the equestrian order. Thus, they would have out-ranked the commanders of provincial legions, who were usually &quot;Viri Egregii&quot; – equestrians of the third class.

&quot;Duces&quot; differed from &quot;praesides&quot; who were the supreme civil as well as military authority within their provinces in that the function of the former was purely military. However, the military authority of a &quot;dux&quot; was not necessarily confined to a single province and they do not seem to have been subject to the authority of the governor of the province in which they happened to be operating. It was not until the end of the 3rd century that the term &quot;dux&quot; emerged as a regular military rank held by a senior officer of &quot;limitanei&quot; – i.e. frontier troops as opposed those attached to an Imperial field-army (&quot;comitatenses&quot;) – with a defined geographic area of responsibility.

===Diocletian&#x27;s reforms===

Under Diocletion, during the Tetrarchy, a new office called &quot;dux&quot; was created with powers split from the role of the governor of a province. The dux was the highest military office within the province and commanded the legions, but the governor had to authorise the use of his powers after which the &quot;dux&quot; could act independently and handle all military matters. The &quot;Dux Belgicae secundae&quot; (&quot;commander of the second Belgic province&quot;) is an example.

Also the provinces were reorganised into dioceses with each diocese administered by a vicarius. As with the governors, the vicarius was assisted by a &quot;dux&quot;. This &quot;dux&quot; was superior to all other &quot;duces&quot; within the dioceses; when the vicarius called the legions of the dioceses into action, all of the legions were at the command of the &quot;dux&quot;. The office of &quot;dux&quot; was, in turn, made subject to the magister militum of his respective praetorian prefecture, and above him to the emperor. The &quot;Dux per Gallias&quot; of the diocese of Gaul is an example of this office.

==Later developments==

In the Byzantine era of the Roman Empire, the position of dux survived (Byzantine Greek: &quot;δούξ&quot;, &quot;doux&quot;, plural &quot;δούκες&quot;, &quot;doukes&quot;) as a rank equivalent to a general (&quot;strategos&quot;). In the late 10th and early 11th centuries, a &quot;doux&quot; or &quot;katepano&quot; was in charge of large circumscriptions consisting of several smaller &quot;themata&quot; and of the professional regiments (&quot;tagmata&quot;) of the Byzantine army (as opposed to the largely militia-like forces of most &quot;themata&quot;). In the Komnenian period, the title of &quot;doux&quot; replaced altogether the &quot;strategos&quot; in designating the military official in charge of a &quot;thema&quot;. In the Byzantine navy, &quot;doukes&quot; of the fleet appear in the 1070s, and the office of &quot;megas doux&quot; (&quot;grand duke&quot;) was created in the 1090s as the commander-in-chief of the entire navy.

The title also gave rise to a family name, the aristocratic Doukas clan, which in the 9th–11th centuries provided several Byzantine emperors and generals, while later bearers of the name (maternally descended from the original family) founded the Despotate of Epirus in northwestern Greece.

==Post-Roman uses==

King Arthur, in one of his earliest literary appearances, is described as &quot;dux bellorum&quot; (&quot;&quot;dux&quot; of battles&quot;) among the kings of the Romano-Britons in their wars against the Anglo-Saxons. A chronicle from St Martin&#x27;s monastery in Cologne states that the monastery had been pillaged by the Saxons in 778, but that it was rebuilt by an &quot;Olgerus, dux Daniæ&quot; (who may have been the historical person around whom the myth of Ogier the Dane formed), with the help of Charlemagne.

&quot;Dux&quot; is also the root of various high feudal noble titles of peerage rank, such as the English &quot;duke&quot;, the French &quot;duc&quot;, the Spanish and Portuguese &quot;duque&quot;, the Venetian &quot;doge&quot;, the Italian &quot;duca&quot; and &quot;duce&quot;, and the Byzantine Greek &quot;dukas&quot; or &quot;doukas&quot; (Gr. δούκας) (see Doukas).

Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini used the title of &quot;dux&quot; (and &quot;duce&quot; in Italian) to represent his leadership. One fascist motto was &quot;DVX MEA LVX&quot;, Latin for &quot;[The] Duce [is] my light&quot; or &quot;[The] Leader [is] my light&quot;.

In pre-revolutionary Russia, the Dux Factory built bicycles, automobiles and aircraft in Moscow.

===Education===

* In Hong Kong, Scotland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand &quot;dux&quot; is a modern title given to the highest-ranking student in academic, arts or sporting achievement (&quot;Dux Litterarum&quot;, &quot;Dux Artium&quot; and &quot;Dux Ludorum&quot; respectively) in each graduating year. This can lead to scholarships at universities. The runner-up may be given the title &quot;proxime accessit&quot; (meaning &quot;he/she came next&quot;) or &quot;semidux&quot;.
* In Portuguese universities the Dux is the most senior of students, usually in charge of overseeing the praxe (initiation rituals for the freshmen).

===Popular culture===
* In &quot;RuneScape 3&quot;, &quot;Dux&quot; is offered to players as a choice of title alongside &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot;.
* In &quot;Light Bringer&quot; of Pierce Brown&#x27;s Red Rising Saga, &quot;Dux&quot; is a rank and title given to those who speak with the authority of their liege, as in the character of &quot;Holiday ti Nakamura&quot;.

<text>Gentium (, from the Latin for &quot;of the nations&quot;) is a Unicode serif typeface family designed by Victor Gaultney. Gentium fonts are free and open source software, and are released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL), which permits modification and redistribution. Gentium has wide support for languages using the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets, and the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Gentium Plus variants released since November 2010 now include over 5,500 glyphs and advanced typographic features through OpenType and formerly Graphite.

Gentium was designed for use at 10-11 points. Wide counters and low stroke contrast improve readability at small point sizes. Long ascenders allow diacritics stacking.

== History and variants ==

===Gentium and GentiumAlt===
The original release of &quot;Gentium&quot; defined roughly 1,500 glyphs covering almost all of the range of Latin characters used worldwide, as well as monotonic and polytonic Greek, designed to flow in harmony with the Latin. Gentium comes with a variant called &quot;GentiumAlt&quot; (&quot;Gentium Alternative&quot;), which contains flatter diacritics intended to improve the appearance of letters with multiple diacritics, as well as a glyph variant of the Greek circumflex that resembles an inverted breve.

In 2003, the Gentium font was awarded a Certificate of Excellence in Type Design from the Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) as one of the best designs of the previous five years.

===Gentium Basic fonts===
In November 2007, the Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic fonts were released, containing Gentium fonts in four faces: regular, italic, bold, and bold italic. Gentium Basic has the same weight as the previous Gentium fonts, while Gentium Book Basic is set at a slightly heavier weight for use in publishing books at small point sizes, or under certain printing conditions. While these fonts contain bold and bold italic variants, they do not contain the full range of glyphs, especially most Greek letters. These fonts are said to be in beta testing and are intended to provide a boldface weight for general applications in the interim while the full bold and bold italic character set is developed.

===Gentium Plus fonts===
An updated version of the roman and italic fonts called &quot;Gentium Plus&quot;, which includes the full extended Latin, IPA, Greek, and Cyrillic coverage, was released in November 2010. Gentium Plus variants containing an additional 3,800 glyphs, including Cyrillic and additional coverage of the IPA, were added in 2010 in a release called &quot;Gentium Plus&quot;. Released shortly afterward was a variant called &quot;Gentium Plus Compact&quot;, which has compact spacing for aesthetic reasons. Both Gentium Plus and Gentium Plus Compact include regular and italic variants of over 5500 glyphs.

Since the initial release of the Gentium Plus fonts, the focus of the project has shifted to completing bold and bold italic weights of the Gentium Plus family, as well as the creation of a &quot;Gentium Book Plus&quot; family with a slightly heavier weight which may be useful at small sizes. These are the weights that are currently available in the Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic fonts.

===Custom character variants===
Variant forms of many characters can be chosen in the word-processor. For example, for primer-style &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;g&#x27;, append codice_1 to the name of the font in the font-selection window. (Features are appended with a colon and linked with an ampersand – see images at right.) Alternatively, customized versions of the fonts can be created with TypeTuner, prior to download, that have those forms preset. 

Features that may be chosen include small capitals, primer-style &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;g&#x27;, roman-style &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;g&#x27; in italic typeface, variant forms of capital &#x27;Ŋ&#x27;, large modifier letter apostrophe and saltillo, Vietnamese-style diacritics, Serbian-style italics (in Cyrillic), staveless tone letters, and automatic fractions.

== Open source development ==
The ongoing development of the font welcomes contributions from its users.
Gentium was released under the Open Font License on November 28, 2005. Older typefaces that support the same character inventory, and also released under the OFL, are Charis SIL and Doulos SIL.

<text>Gordon Miller Buehrig (B-yur-rig) (June 18, 1904 – January 22, 1990) was an American automobile designer.

==Early life==
Gordon Miller Buehrig was born in Mason City, Illinois on June 18, 1904 to a banker. He attended Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, but did not graduate.

==Career==
After dropping out of Bradley University in 1924, he worked as a body shop apprentice in Wayne, Michigan.

He had early design experience with Packard, General Motors and Stutz. In 1929, he was responsible for designing the bodies (built by Weymann) of the Stutz Black Hawks entered at Le Mans. At age 25 he became chief body designer for Duesenberg, where he designed the Model J. He joined the Auburn Automobile Company of Auburn, Indiana, in 1934, producing the famous 1935 851 Boattail Speedster, based on the work of Alan Leamy. (A kit copy of this car was driven by the lead character in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Remington Steele&quot;.) He also designed the distinctive Cord 810/812, the latter recognized for its originality by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. At the end of World War II, he worked with Studebaker and his design ideas led to their 1947 models.

In 1949, Buehrig joined Ford, where his projects included the 1951 Victoria Coupe, the 1952 station wagon, and the 1956 Continental Mark II. He invented the removable T-top, patented 5 June 1951, which was used in the aborted TASCO sports car.

Retiring from Ford in 1965, Buehrig taught from 1965 to 1970 at the Art Center College of Design in California. In 1979, he produced the design for the Buehrig motor car, a limited-production carriage roof coupe. In his last five years, he consulted for the Franklin Mint and helped oversee the development of their model cars.

==Personal life==
Buehrig married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Whitten on December 23, 1934. Together, they had one daughter, Barbara. His wife died on August 28, 1970. 

He later married Kathryn &quot;Kay&quot; Lundell. He also had two stepdaughters: Carol and Joanne.

==Death==
Buehrig died at his home in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, on January 22, 1990, at the age of 85. His cremated remains are buried in Roselawn Cemetery in Auburn, Indiana.

==Awards and legacy==
Buehrig was honored by the Scarab Club in Detroit, an artists&#x27; club with a show of his work and asking him to sign the beam in the banquet hall. During that event he revealed that one of his favorite vehicles was the Duesenberg 20 Grand, which was developed for the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1933 along with three other vehicles. Buehrig had read Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Toward an Architecture&quot; and was deeply inspired by it. Buehrig&#x27;s work also led to front-wheel-drive Oldsmobile cars and also inspired a Chrysler vehicle with its hood design.

In 1981, he was included a list of the top 30 people who influenced automotive history by the Society of Automotive Historians.

His Twenty Grand Duesenberg design was selected to be exhibited in Essen, Germany as one of “The Ten Most Beautiful Cars in the World&quot; and won Best of Show at the 1980 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in October 1989.

He was one of 25 candidates for Car Designer of the Century, an international award given in 1999 to honor the most influential automobile designer of the 20th century. It was won by Giorgetto Giugiaro.

<text>The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is a three-step examination program for medical licensure in the United States sponsored by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). Physicians with a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree are required to pass the USMLE for medical licensure. However, those with a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO) are required to take the COMLEX-USA (COMLEX) exams but may also sit for the USMLE as well.

States may enact additional testing and/or licensing requirements.

==History==
The USMLE was created in the early 1990s. The program replaced the multiple examinations, including the NBME Part Examination program and the FSMB&#x27;s Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX) program, that offered paths to medical licensing in the medical profession.

The examination was originally imparted using pencil and paper. In 1999, computerized examination delivery was included.

In 2004, an examination with standardized patients to assess clinical-skills was added to Step 2 of the USMLE (Step 2 Clinical Skills), and required for licensure beginning with the medical school graduating class of 2005. During the COVID-19 pandemic, USMLE Step 2CS was initially suspended and later discontinued.

A review of the program was enacted in 2009. USMLE claimed it was done with the intention of orienting the examination to support the licensing decisions made by medical boards, transitioning the exam to a competencies schema and emphasizing the importance of scientific foundations of medicine throughout the examination sequence. They also aimed to continue the assessment of clinical skill and interpretation of clinical information.

USMLE announced a move to a pass/fail model on February 12, 2020, along with other changes. They claimed this was done in an attempt by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) to balance focus between exams and actual coursework. The change became effective in 2022.

==Description and purpose==
The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is required for medical licensure in the United States by all graduates of M.D.-granting American medical schools as well as all graduates of international medical schools. It consists of three examinations:
* Step 1: Assesses foundational medical science typically obtained during the first two years of medical school
* Step 2CK: Evaluates the applicant&#x27;s knowledge of clinical medicine
* Step 3: Assesses the application of clinical knowledge to patient management

Previously, USMLE included a clinical skills portion called USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills. It was discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Step 1 and 2 are typically completed by U.S. medical students during medical school, while Step 3 is usually taken by the end of the first year of residency. While the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams can be taken at Prometric test centers worldwide, the Step 3 can only be taken in the United States.

The USMLE is sponsored by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). They developed it originally to provide state medical boards in the United States with a common examination for all licensure applicants. However, over time it has also been extensively used by residency programs to predict residency performance and screen residents for selection during the National Resident Matching Program.

Even though it was estimated that at least 60% of osteopathic medical students took at least one USMLE exam in 2020, physicians with D.O. degree are not required to take the USMLE for licensure or graduation. They are licensed as physicians by passing Parts I, II, and III of the COMLEX examination from the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners.
==Eligibility==
As of 2024, to be eligible for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), candidates must meet specific criteria based on the step of the exam they are applying for:

Step 1 and Step 2 CK:

Candidates must fall into one of the following categories at the time of application and on the day of the examination:

* Medical Students or Graduates of U.S. or Canadian MD Programs:
** Must be officially enrolled in, or a graduate of, a U.S. or Canadian medical school program leading to the MD degree, accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME).
* Medical Students or Graduates of U.S. DO Programs:
** Must be officially enrolled in, or a graduate of, a U.S. medical school program leading to the DO degree, accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA).
* Medical Students or Graduates of International Medical Schools:
** Must be officially enrolled in, or a graduate of, a medical school outside the U.S. and Canada that is listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools as meeting the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) eligibility requirements, and must meet all other eligibility criteria of the ECFMG.

Step 3:

To be eligible for Step 3, candidates must:

* Have Passed Step 1 and Step 2 CK:
** Successfully obtain passing scores on both Step 1 and Step 2 CK.
* Hold an MD or DO Degree:
** Possess an MD or DO degree from an LCME- or COCA-accredited U.S. or Canadian medical school, or an equivalent MD degree from an international medical school listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools that meets ECFMG eligibility requirements and obtain ECFMG Certification.
* Meet Additional Criteria:
** Fulfill all other eligibility requirements as outlined in the USMLE Bulletin of Information.

The USMLE program also recommends that applicants for Step 3 have completed, or be near completion of, at least one year of postgraduate training in an accredited U.S. graduate medical education program that satisfies state board licensing requirements.

==Pass rates by exam==

== Controversies ==
===USMLE response to COVID-19===
The USMLE was met with criticism for their lack of adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic. The criticism was two-fold: First, for the mishandling and poor communication of exam cancellations by both USMLE program administrators and the third-party exam administrator, Prometric. Second, the pandemic crisis exacerbated existing resentment towards the high-stakes nature of the exam: namely, several students and physicians were upset that the USMLE refused to move up the 2022 deadline of making Step 1 into a pass or fail exam.

===Racial differences in outcome associated with the use of USMLE Step 1 scores to grant residency interviews===
A study conducted in 2020 showed differences in USMLE Step 1 scores attributable to race and ethnicity, with lower mean scores for self-identified Black, Asian, and Hispanic examinees when compared with self-identified White examinees. The mean effect was larger when comparing Caucasian applicants (223) with Black and Hispanic applicants (216). Depending on the threshold score, an African American was 3–6x less likely to be offered an interview.&quot;
&quot;61% of minority applicants were accepted into an orthopaedic residency versus 73% of White applicants. White and Asian applicants and residents had higher USMLE Step 1. White applicants and matriculated candidates had higher odds of Alpha Omega Alpha membership compared with Black, Hispanic, and other groups.
In 2020, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Association of American Medical Colleges expressed their support for changing Step 1 to pass or fail, in part to reduce racial bias.

===Financial considerations===
The US Medical Licensing Examinations have received criticism due to their high cost. As of 2023, the USMLE charges (in U.S. dollars):
* $660 for Step 1 for US/Canada students (increasing to $670 in 2024), $1,000 for International medical graduates (IMGs)
* $660 for Step 2 CK for US/Canada students (increasing to $670 in 2024), $1,000 for IMGs
* $915 for Step 3 for all students (increasing to $925 in 2024)

As part of a broader public plea for systemic changes to the improper use of USMLE exams, STAT wrote that this &quot;multimillion-dollar industry has exploited the opportunity to extract thousands of dollars from already overly indebted students. Registering for STEP exams test cost $645–1300, while Step preparation materials and courses run much higher.&quot;

<text>Thomas Crofton Croker (15 January 1798 – 8 August 1854) was an Irish antiquary, best known for his &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland&quot; (1825–1828), and who also showed considerable interest in Irish song and music.

Although &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; purported to be an anthology of tales Croker had collected on his field trips, he had lost his manuscript notes and the work had to be reconstructed with the help of friends. He did not acknowledge his debt satisfactorily in the estimation of Thomas Keightley, who voiced his complaint publicly, and soon published his own rival work. The other collaborators generally allowed Croker to take credit, notably William Maginn, though after his death his kinsmen insisted Maginn had written four or more of the tales. Croker retracted ten tales in his third edition of (1834), and after his death, a fourth edition (1859) appeared which was prefaced with a memoir written by his son.

William Butler Yeats, who appropriated a number of tales for his anthology, characterised Croker as belonging to the class of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, and criticised him for comic distortions of the Irish tradition, an assessment echoed by other Irish critics. Bridget G. MacCarthy wrote a biographical paper that scrutinises Croker&#x27;s habit of publishing writings by others under his own name. Defenders of Croker include Justin McCarthy and Neil C. Hultin.

==Life and works ==

Croker was born in the city of Cork, the only son of Major Thomas Croker and his wife, the former Miss Dillon, daughter of Croker Dillon and widow of a Mr Fitton. At age 15, he apprenticed in business. During the years 1812 to 1815, he travelled the south of Ireland and began collecting legends and songs. Croker took one Irish coronach (keening) that he collected in Cork in 1813, and translated it into English prose, which was published in the &quot;Morning Post&quot; in 1815 and caught the attention of the poet George Crabbe in 1817, through the intermediary of the antiquary .

Croker also showed talent as an artist, and his works were exhibited at Cork in 1817 (&quot;pen-sketches of pilot-boats&quot;), but he abandoned art in favour of literary pursuit.

Around 1818, he sent to the poet Thomas Moore a set of about forty ancient Irish air or songs, and some collected poetry, and Moore used the material in editions of his &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death on 22 March 1818, the estate was managed by his distant relative (or of no relation), John Wilson Croker who was then Secretary of the Admiralty, and who procured him a position as a clerk there, a position he would retain for thirty years until his retirement in 1850.

He was a man of short stature, measuring 4 feet 10½ inches tall, and described by Sir Walter Scott as &quot;Little as a dwarf, keen-eyed as a hawk and of very prepossessing manners—something like Tom Moore&quot;.

Croker eventually devoted himself largely to the collection of ancient Irish poetry and Irish folklore.

=== &quot;Researches in the South of Ireland&quot; ===
Croker&#x27;s first book, &quot;Researches in the South of Ireland&quot; (1824), was well-received by fellow-antiquaries. According to Croker in his preface, the book was illustrated with pencil drawings by Miss Nicholson and Alfred Nicholson (1788–1833) (his future wife and brother-in-law) who accompanied him on the field trip gathering material.

=== &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; ===
&quot;Researches&quot; was followed by &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland&quot; (1825–1828), which enjoyed immense popular success. This would be Croker&#x27;s most important work. Walter Scott praised the book in a letter, and commended it in his own works.

The first part was published in 1825; and was translated into German by the Brothers Grimm (&quot;Irische Elfenmärchen&quot;, 1826). Parts two and three followed in 1828. Part three consisted of the long Grimm essay on fairies (prefaced to the &quot;Elfenmärchen&quot;) Croker translated, coupled with a section on Welsh fairy tales written by an unidentified female correspondent.

The first edition of &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; was illustrated with woodcuts by W. H. Brooke; while the second edition was supplied with original drawings by Cork&#x27;s Daniel Maclise, though undergoing stylistic modifications by the engraver, Brooke. The third edition, three volumes in one was published in 1834. The work went through a total of six editions during the 19th century.

It was instrumental in attracting a wider audience to traditional Irish tales, not just within the English-speaking world, but farther abroad. However, Croker modified the tales according to his own inclinations, and has been criticised for adding too literary a style, and contrived humour to the tales.

==== Collaboration controversy ====

Because Croker had lost the manuscript after collecting it from the field, he had to reconstruct the anthology through help from other writers, such as William Maginn, David Richard Pigot, his friend Joseph Humphreys, Thomas Keightley, and R. Adolphus Lynch of Killarney. The first 1825 edition of &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions&quot; did not even bear Croker&#x27;s name, owing to this being a collaborative effort. Humphreys, a Quaker, was a companion during Croker&#x27;s excursions into the south 1812–1815. Samuel Carter Hall named himself as the contributor of two tales, and Charles Dod of &quot;Parliamentary Companion&quot; as another collaborator.

In &quot;Fairy Legends&quot;, the credit for the first piece &quot;The Legend of Knocksheogowna&quot; and three others were claimed by Maginn, including the prominent &quot;Daniel O&#x27;Rourke&quot;. But according to Croker, the manuscript of &quot;Daniel O&#x27;Rourke&quot; was in the handwriting of Humphreys, touched up by Maginn, and further altered by Croker before going into print. Though such production that entails modification at multiple stages may be poorly countenanced by the modern folklorist, it is pointed out that such methodology is not so distant from the one practised by the Grimms at the time.

Croker eventually took sole credit, and kept all of the proceeds from the book&#x27;s financial success, but of these collaborators, only Keightley publicly voiced protest, and Keightley went on to publish his own &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; in 1828. In the wake of it, Croker published the 1834 third edition that eliminated portions of competing claims, reducing the number of tales from 50 down to 40, and purged of &quot;most of the copious notes&quot;, of which the comparative notes Keightley claimed to have supplied. Literary scholar Bridget G. MacCarthy gave a modern-day view criticism of Croker&#x27;s dodging his way out of attributing the effort of collaborators.

==== Daniel O&#x27;Rourke on stage ====
Croker adapted the tale &quot;Daniel O&#x27;Rourke&quot; into a Christmas Pantomime under the title &quot;Harlequin and the Eagle&quot;, and performed in 1826 at the Adelphi Theatre, for the sake of actor Daniel Terry. The actor had obtained ownership of the theatre, with considerable financial backing from Walter Scott, who was a friend of the actor&#x27;s. Scott lavished praises on the pantomime at a meeting with Croker. Though it has been told anecdotally that it was Scott&#x27;s idea to turn this into a play, Croker had this notion earlier, as evidenced in his notes to &quot;Fairy Legends&quot;. The play was published as &quot;Daniel O&#x27;Rourke, or Rhymes of a Pantomime&quot;, with a second edition appearing in 1828.

=== Noviomagus ===
In 1828, Croker participated in an excavation of the Roman site Noviomagus in Kent, and together with some members of the Society of Antiquaries, formed a club named &quot;Noviomagian Society&quot;, for which Croker was voted president. Collecting, antiquarianism, and jocularity were hallmarks of the society.

=== Legends of the Lakes ===
Croker&#x27;s third book, &quot;Legends of the Lakes; or, Sayings and Doings at Killarney&quot; (1829) was both a critical and commercial disappointment. It was written in the form of a guided tour through the landscapes of at Killarney, interspersed with legends told in the dialect of the peasantry. He also featured discussions of the music of his friend the Irish piper James Gandsey, of some interest to bagpipe or uilleann pipe musicology.

=== Later life ===
Croker married in 1830 Marianne Nicholson (1792–1854), daughter of Francis Nicholson. T. F. Dillon Croker FSA, FRGS, was their son and only child.

Croker assisted in founding the Camden Society (1838) and Percy Society (1840).

He edited &quot;The Keen of the South of Ireland&quot; (1844) for the Percy Society. The first item in this collection (in the preface) was a keen composed in Irish by the mother of Flory Sullivan, collected in Gougane Barra, Co. Cork in 1813. Croker&#x27;s translation of it into English got published in the &quot;Morning Post&quot; in 1815, as already noted above, and caught the notice of poet George Crabbe in 1817. It was an earlier version which was shown to Crabbe in correspondence, but on Crabbe&#x27;s advice, Croker had revised the translation to a more simplified version, more in keeping with the original Irish. B. G. MacCarthy notes that he did not actually translate the keen himself but pass off the labour of native Irish informants such as Mrs. Harrington as his own, and when left to his own devices, Croker &quot;merely revealed ignorance&quot; of the Irish language.

He and his wife&#x27;s testimonies about funereal customs, particularly the tradition of keening the deceased are among the earliest and most significant contributions to the understanding of the Irish language lament and the accompanying traditions.

Croker died in Old Brompton, London, England on 8 August 1854, and lies buried in Brompton Cemetery. His wife survived him but briefly, passing away on 6 October 1854.

== Analysis ==

=== Attitude to folklore ===
Croker did not present his folklore as he found them, but reinvented them in his own literary style, as pointed out by numerous commentators, even cursory ones. The sort of mixing of folklore and literature was also carried out by contemporaries such as Walter Scott in Scotland. But Croker the antiquarian betrayed a &quot;patronizing&quot; attitude toward his subject, the Irish common folk steeped in tradition.

Croker was an Anglo-Irishman (like Keightley), or as Yeats put it, part of the &quot; Irish gentility&quot; (like Lover). Yeats was not the only one to charge Croker with viewing the lore of the Irish peasantry in a tinted &quot;humorised&quot; light; this gratuitous mockery was also noted, for example, by folklorist Seán Ó Súilleabháin. Yeats repeatedly refers to the class that &quot;imagined [Ireland] as a humorist&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;, and continues &quot;Their work [i.e., of the early folklore collectors] had the dash as well as the shallowness of an ascendant and idle class, and in Croker is touched everywhere with beauty – a gentle Arcadian beauty&quot;.

Literary scholar Neil C. Hultin also defended the author. Hultin was well aware that Irish critics bristled at Croker&#x27;s comic caricatures of the Irish and their brogue, but refrained from himself criticising Croker for insensitivity. Hultin co-wrote with Warren U. Ober the introduction to Croker&#x27;s reissued &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; (1993), which also depicted Croker in a sympathetic light, stating that he showed genuine affection for the peasantry, and commiseration for the oppression felt by Ireland. Hultin and Ober have suggested that Croker was trapped between two polar-opposite stereotypes of the Irish: both &quot;intelligent, sensitive&quot; and &quot;headstrong, violent&quot;.

=== On ancient manuscript records ===
Croker was contemptuous of Irish annals such as the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, and manuscripts such as the &quot;Book of Ballymote&quot; which contained narratives and poetry, calling them &quot;the monkish chronicles&quot; or &quot;relics&quot;, and stating in a cavalier manner that Irish history would not suffer at all at &quot;the total loss of the legendary records of an age of ignorance and superstition&quot;.

He claimed to be capable of reading Irish manuscripts, but it is doubtful whether he had any real proficiency in the Irish language.

<text>George Croly (17 August 1780 – 24 November 1860) was an Irish poet, novelist, historian, and Anglican priest. He was rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London from 1835 until his death.

==Early life==
Croly was born in Dublin. His father was a physician. He graduated from Trinity College Dublin with an MA in 1804. The college was to award him an honorary LLD in 1831.

He was ordained in 1804, and served as a curate at a parish in the diocese of Meath until around 1810. Then, accompanied by his widowed mother, his brother Henry and his sisters, he moved to London. Finding himself unable to obtain preferment in the church, he dedicated himself to a literary career.

==Literary career==
Croly was a leading contributor to the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, from the establishment of both in 1817, and was also associated with the Tory magazine &quot;Britannia&quot;. He worked as a theatre critic for the &quot;New Times&quot; and later as a foreign correspondent. He wrote poems, plays, satires, novels, history, and theological works, and achieved some measure of success in all. Perhaps his best known works were his novels, &quot;Salathiel&quot; (1828), based on the legend of the Wandering Jew, and &quot;Marston&quot; (1846). His main contribution to theological literature was an exposition of the Apocalypse. His hymns included &quot;Spirit of God, descend upon my heart&quot; written in 1854.

==Religious appointments==
In 1832 he was put in charge of the parish of Romford in Essex, while the vicar was unable to carry out his duties due to illness. The editor of the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;, William Jerdan, had previously attempted to procure a living for him, but this had proved unsuccessful, the reason (according to Croly&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;) being a confusion between him and another clergyman, a former Roman Catholic, with a similar name. In 1835, however, through the influence of Lord Brougham, a distant relative of his wife he was appointed rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London, a position he held until his death. He had previously turned down Brougham&#x27;s offer of a remote living on the edge of Dartmoor. His son Frederick wrote:This parish being very small, and most of the parishioners non-resident, the new rector could still devote a large portion of his time to general literature. A still greater advantage of his new position was, that it afforded an opportunity of exercising in a metropolitan church those remarkable powers as a preacher, which had been comparatively thrown away upon a rural congregation. The church of St Stephen&#x27;s, previously almost deserted, soon became filled, under the influence of this powerful attraction, with a large and attentive congregation, most of whom came from a considerable distance.In 1847 he was appointed afternoon preacher to the Foundling Hospital, but soon resigned after criticism from its governors, who felt that his style was unsuitable for a congregation consisting mainly of children and servants. In his letter of resignation, Croly wrote &quot;Christianity is a manly religion, addressed to manly understandings, and which ought to be preached in a manly language.&quot; He usually preached &quot;extemporare&quot;. S.C. Hall described him as having &quot;&#x27;a sort of rude and indeed angry eloquence that would have stood him in better stead at the bar than in the pulpit.&quot;

==Family==
In 1819 Croly married Margaret Helen Begbie, whom he had come to know though his work for the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;, to which she was also a contributor. They had five sons and a daughter. His eldest son, George Alfred, a lieutenant in the 26th Bengal Native Infantry, died at the Battle of Ferozeshah in 1845, aged 23. His wife died in 1851, and he lost his nine-year-old daughter a few months later.

==Death==
He died suddenly on 24 November 1860 while walking near his home in Bloomsbury, and was buried in St Stephen&#x27;s.

==Writings==
His published works included:
*&quot;Paris in 1815&quot;, a poem, 1817.
*&quot;The Angel of the World&quot;, 1820.
* &quot;May Fair&quot;, 1820.

<text>Catherine Ann Crowe (&quot;née&quot; Stevens; 20 September 1790 – 14 June 1872) was an English novelist, a writer of social and supernatural stories, and a playwright. She also wrote for children.

==Life==
Catherine Ann Stevens was born in Borough Green, Kent, England. She was educated at home, spending most of her childhood in Kent.

She married an army officer, Major John Crowe (1783–1872) and had a son, John William Crowe (1824–1901), but the marriage was an unhappy one, and when she met Sydney Smith and his family at Clifton, Bristol in 1828, she asked them for their help. Little is known about the next few years, but by 1838 she was separated from her husband, living in Edinburgh, and had made the acquaintance of several writers, including the impecunious Thomas de Quincey of Edinburgh and Harriet Martineau and William Makepeace Thackeray of London. Smith was also an encouragement to her in her writing.

Stevens&#x27;s success waned somewhat in the later 1850s and she sold her copyrights in 1861. After 1852, she lived mainly in London and abroad, but she moved to Folkestone in 1872, where she died the following year.

==Writings==
Crowe&#x27;s two plays, the verse tragedy &quot;Aristodemus&quot; (1838) and the melodrama &quot;The Cruel Kindness&quot; (1853), both had historical themes paralleling her own family problems. Both were published and the second had a short run in London in 1853.

The book that established Crowe as a novelist was &quot;The Adventures of Susan Hopley&quot; (1847). It was followed by &quot;Men and Women&quot; (1844), the well-received &quot;The Story of Lily Dawson&quot; (1847), &quot;The Adventures of a Beauty&quot; (1852), and &quot;Linny Lockwood&quot; (1854). Though set in middle-class life, they had complicated, sensational plots, while also commenting on the predicaments of Victorian women brought up in seclusion to be mistreated by those men who did not subscribe to standards of decent behaviour. This aspect of her writing was emphasised particularly by later women writers in an appreciation in &quot;Women Novelists of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Reign&quot; (1897). &quot;Susan Hopley&quot; was reprinted many times, and to her annoyance, dramatised and turned into a penny serial. Her stories were also in demand from periodicals such as the weekly &quot;Chambers&#x27; Edinburgh Journal&quot; and Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Household Words&quot;.

The play &quot;Susan Hopley; or, The Vicissitudes of a Servant Girl&quot;, adapted from Crowe&#x27;s novel by George Dibdin Pitt, opened at the Royal Victoria Theatre in 1841 and became a long-running success. By 1849, it had been performed 343 times.

Crowe turned increasingly to supernatural subjects, inspired by German writers. Her collection &quot;The Night-side of Nature&quot; (1848) became her most popular work and was reprinted as recently as 2000. It was translated into German and French, and is said to have influenced the views of Charles Baudelaire. Her own involvement in such matters came to a bizarre culmination in February 1854, when she was discovered naked in Edinburgh one night, convinced that spirits had rendered her invisible. She was treated for mental illness and was said to have recovered. Two of her ghost stories reappeared in &quot;Victorian Ghost Stories&quot; (1936), edited by Montague Summers.

Crowe also wrote a number of books for children, including versions of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; for young readers, &quot;Pippie&#x27;s Warning; or, Mind Your Temper&quot; (1848), &quot;The Story of Arthur Hunter and his First Shilling&quot; (1861) and &quot;The Adventures of a Monkey&quot; (1862).

<text>The Honolulu Catholic Cemetery (also known as the King Street Catholic Cemetery) is a cemetery in Honolulu, Hawaii. The cemetery is for Roman Catholics and is located at 839-A South King Street, . It is maintained by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and has been the final resting place for many Roman Catholics from Honolulu before 1930. The cemetery is closed to further burials by the Hawaii Department of Health. 
The origins of the cemetery were two separate lots. The first lot was given by the Kingdom of Hawaii to the Roman Catholic mission during the 1840s and was identified by the title &quot;Claim No. 4&quot;. The second lot was purchased by several wealthy Catholics and given to the Roman Catholic mission. Originally on the outskirts of the village of Honolulu, with the makai side consisting of estuarine wetlands and man-made ponds for the harvesting of sea salt (or paakai in Hawaiian). The Waikiki side of the cemetery was the old Plantation and rice paddies. In 1889, the cemetery consisted of scattered graves and overrunning paths. Wealthier Catholics ensured that their private plots were enclosed by wooden or iron fences and a tombstone. Msgr. Koeckemann erected the tall iron cross in the center of the cemetery. He was eventually laid to rest under the cross. Several other bishops of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, (&quot;Msgri&quot;. Gulstan Ropert, Libert H. Boeynaems, and Stephen Alencastre) were also buried next to Msgr. Koeckemann. Remains of some forty of the early members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts also lay buried since 1853 in a common grave on site. Other notable people buried in this cemetery include: the native Hawaiian patriot and former delegate to the United States Congress, Robert William Wilcox; Princess Eugenie Ninito Sumner of Tahiti, wife of High Chief John Kapilikea Sumner, and friend of Queen Liliuokalani. 
In 1889, shortly after his arrival in Honolulu, Father Valentin Franckx, SS.CC., former pastor of Saint Augustine by the Sea Catholic Church in Waikīkī laid out a central road and side paths in the cemetery so that each lot could be reached without walking over neighboring lots. 
Many trees were removed and in 1892, Father Valentin planted the stately royal palms that line the main lane to the cemetery. Father Valentin reported that a society was organized for the upkeep and improvement of the cemetery. Members paid an annual fee of five dollars.

A permanent sexton was appointed and anyone acquiring a lot paid ten dollars for a grave and another ten dollars for the digging. The makai portion of the cemetery was found to be unfit for digging to the six-foot depth required by the Board of Health.
To alleviate encountering ground water during burials, Father Valentin approved the importation of new soil from the nearby Armory. 

After the closure of the cemetery by the Board of Health, the vicariate made arrangements for Catholic interments at Diamond Head Memorial Park.
As of 2004, the lots closest to King Street are watered and maintained better. Those plots further in (close to the Hawaiian Electric Company yard) appear to be minimally maintained, if at all. Several grave markers are sequestered at the corner of what appears to have been a chapel and tree roots from a &quot;Ficus&quot; have obscured the original plots.
