<text>The siege of Haarlem was an episode of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. From 11 December 1572 to 13 July 1573 an army of Philip II of Spain laid bloody siege to the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands, whose loyalties had begun wavering during the previous summer. After the naval battle of Haarlemmermeer and the defeat of a land relief force, the starving city surrendered and the garrison was massacred. The resistance nonetheless was taken as an heroic example by the Orangists at the sieges of Alkmaar and Leiden.

==Prelude==
The city of Haarlem initially held a moderate view in the religious war that was going on in the Netherlands. It managed to escape from the Reformed iconoclasm in 1566 that affected other cities in the Netherlands. When the city of Brielle was conquered by the Geuzen revolutionary army on 1 April, Haarlem did not initially support the Geuzen. Most city administrators—unlike many citizens—did not favor open revolution against Philip II of Spain, who had inherited rule of the Netherlands from his father, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, after much political debate the city officially turned against Philip II on 4 July 1572.

The ruler of Spain was not pleased, and sent an army north under command of Don Fadrique (&quot;Don Frederick&quot; in Dutch), son of the Duke of Alva. On 17 November 1572 all citizens of the city of Zutphen were murdered by the Spanish army, and on 1 December the city of Naarden suffered the same fate.

The city administration of Haarlem sent a deputation of 4 people to Amsterdam to attempt to negotiate with Don Fadrique. The city&#x27;s defenses were commanded by city-governor Wigbolt Ripperda, a commander put in charge by William the Silent, the Prince of Orange. He strongly disapproved of negotiating with the Spanish army, called the city guard together, and convinced them to stay loyal to the Prince of Orange. The city&#x27;s administration was replaced with pro-Orange citizens. When the deputation came back from Amsterdam, they were convicted as traitors and sent to the Prince. The Sint-Bavokerk (Saint Bavo Church) was cleared of Roman Catholic symbols the same day.

==Under siege==

On 11 December 1572 the Spanish army laid siege to Haarlem. The city was not very strong, militarily speaking. Although the city was completely surrounded by walls, they were not in good shape. The area around the city could not be inundated, and offered the enemy many places to set up camp. However, the existence of the Haarlemmermeer (a great lake) nearby made it difficult for the enemy to cut off the transportation of food into the city completely.

In the Middle Ages it was unusual to fight in the winter, but the city of Haarlem was crucial and Don Fadrique stayed and put the town under siege. During the first two months of the siege, the situation was in balance. The Spanish army dug two tunnels to reach the city walls and collapse them. The defenders made tunnels to blow up the Spanish tunnels. The situation became worse for Haarlem on 29 March 1573. The Amsterdam army, faithful to the Spanish king, occupied the Haarlemmermeer and effectively blocked Haarlem from the outside world. Hunger in the city grew, and the situation became so tense that on 27 May many (Spanish-loyal) prisoners were taken from the prison and murdered.
On 19 December no less than 625 shots were fired at the defensive wall between the Janspoort and the Catherijnebridge. This forced the defenders to put up a completely new wall.

Two city gates, the Kruispoort and the Janspoort, collapsed from the fighting.

Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer, a widow of a shipwright, aided in restoring the city fortifications during the siege. Later this would develop into a historical myth that she personally fought and even led an army of 300 women into battle.

In the beginning of July William I of Orange put together an army of 5000 soldiers near Leiden, to rescue Haarlem. However, the Spanish trapped them at the &quot;Manpad&quot; and defeated the army.

==Surrender==
In the early days of the battle, the Spanish army tried an assault of the city walls, but this attempt to quickly conquer the city failed due to the insufficient preparation by the Spanish army, which had not expected much resistance. This initial victory gave the defenders&#x27; morale a big boost.

After seven months the city surrendered on 13 July 1573. Usually, after such a siege, there would be a period of time that the soldiers of the victorious army could pillage the city, but the citizens were allowed to buy themselves and the city free for 240,000 guilders.

The written assurances that had been given to the city were respected, but the whole garrison (which included many English, French Huguenots, and Germans) was executed with the exception of the Germans.
Forty burghers considered guilty of sedition were executed as well; the besiegers having run out of ammunition, many of them were drowned in the Spaarne river. While most citizens were allowed to leave, 1500 of the city’s defenders were either beheaded or tied back-to-back in a pair and thrown into the river. Governor Ripperda and his lieutenant were beheaded. Don Fadrique thanked God for his victory in the Sint-Bavokerk. The city would have to host a Spanish garrison.

==Aftermath==
Although ultimately the city could not be kept for the Prince of Orange, the siege showed other cities that the Spanish army was not invincible. This idea, and the great losses suffered by the Spanish army (maybe 10,000 men), helped the cities of Leiden and Alkmaar in their sieges. The latter city would later defeat the Spanish army, a major breakthrough in the Dutch Revolt. In the Sint-Bavo church the following words can still be read:

In dees grote nood, in ons uutereste ellent&lt;br&gt;
Gaven wij de stadt op door hongers verbant&lt;br&gt;
Niet dat hij se in creegh met stormender hant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this great need, in our uttermost misery,&lt;br&gt;
we gave up the city, forced by hunger,&lt;br&gt;
not that he took her by storm.

The Army of Flanders was subsequently plagued by serious mutinies.

==Literature and film==
Some Dutch cities celebrate their victory over the Spanish with a yearly celebration of independence, such as Alkmaar since 8 October 1573 and Leiden since 2–3 October 1574. Haarlem did not win on 13 July 1573, however, and this has made independence celebrations somewhat problematic. The siege of Haarlem has been made into 3 plays; most notably by Juliana de Lannoy in 1770.

The 2014 Dutch film &quot;Kenau&quot; depicts the siege, enhancing the legendary acts of the women defending the city.

<text>The Military William Order, or often named Military Order of William (Dutch: , abbreviation: MWO), is the oldest and highest honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is named after St. William of Gellone (755–814), the first Prince of Orange. Its motto is (For Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty). The chivalric order was established on 30 April 1815 by King William I and was presented for feats of excellent bravery on the battlefield and as a meritorious decoration to senior military officers. Comparable with the French Légion d’Honneur but far less often awarded, it is open to everyone regardless of rank or nobility—not only to Dutch military, but also to foreigners. To date, membership in the Order is extremely rarely awarded, and only for exceptional bravery in battle.

In the spring of 1940 it was decided that civilians would receive the Order for heroic acts in the resistance. After the liberation of the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, several men and one woman from the resistance were awarded it.

==History==

Most knighthoods of the Military Order of William were awarded in 1815 and shortly afterwards to military of the Allies that fought Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, in total 1,005 knighthoods were awarded at this time. The Knight Grand Cross was awarded to Prince William of Orange, the Duke of Wellington, Fürst Blücher von Wahlstatt, Graf von Bülow von Dennewitz and Graf von Gneisenau.

During the 19th century the Order was awarded to military serving in the campaign against the Belgian Revolution and military serving in the Dutch East Indies, mostly in the Aceh War. Until 1940, a total of 5,874 persons had been awarded the Military Order of William. In 1940, the Order was awarded to soldiers who had served with extreme valour in the defence of the Netherlands from the invasion by Nazi-Germany. In 1944 and 1945, with the liberation of the Netherlands from German occupation, the Order was again awarded, this time to Dutch citizens as well as members of the Allied forces for deeds of gallantry. Of the 3,500 servicemen who served in the Netherlands United Nations Detachment in the Korean War, three servicemen – two posthumously – were admitted to the Order. Since 1940, 199 names have been added to the register of the Military Order of William. The latest conflict that has been cause for the honour to be awarded was the war in Afghanistan.

On 29 May 2009 a ceremony was held at which the knights met, at Queen Beatrix&#x27;s bestowal of the knighthood (fourth class) of the Order on Marco Kroon, platoon commander with the Korps Commandotroepen, at the Binnenhof, in The Hague. Kroon was honoured for conspicuous bravery, leadership, and devotion to duty during his service in Afghanistan from March to August 2006. The knights met on 4 December 2014 at King Willem-Alexander&#x27;s bestowal of the knighthood (fourth class) of the Order on Gijs Tuinman, commander with the Korps Commandotroepen, at the Binnenhof, in The Hague. The knights met on 31 August 2018 at King Willem-Alexander&#x27;s bestowal of the knighthood (fourth class) of the Order on Roy de Ruiter, (reserve-) Major, Royal Netherlands Air Force. Maj. Kenneth Mayhew, 101 at the time, was unable to attend the ceremony on 31 August 2018, which he explained in an interview broadcast on Dutch national television during the ceremony.

==Ranks==
By 1945, the following classes of the Military William Order were in existence.
* Knight Grand Cross – wears the badge on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest;
* Commander – wears the badge on a necklet, plus an identical breast cross on the left chest;
* Knight 3rd class – wears the badge on a ribbon with rosette on the left chest;
* Knight 4th class – wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest.

The rank of Knight Grand Cross could also be awarded as an exceptional presentation to heads of state which had displayed feats of loyalty to the Netherlands during wartime. Only the US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, and the British King George VI were conferred such an honour in the 20th century. In the 19th century, the Knight Grand Cross was often conferred on foreign monarchs as a mere mark of respect.

The 4th class could also be awarded as a unit presentation to military commands which had displayed feats of gallantry during wartime.


==Insignia==

The badge of the Order is a white-enamelled Maltese Cross, in silver for the 4th class and in gilt for higher classes; a green enamelled Burgundy Cross appears between the arms of the Maltese Cross. The obverse bears a golden firesteel at the centre, and the motto &quot;Voor Moed – Beleid – Trouw&quot; (For Bravery – Leadership – Loyalty) on the arms of the Maltese Cross. Both the Burgundy Cross and the firesteel were symbols of the House of Valois-Burgundy during their lordship of the Netherlands and probably are meant to recall its crucial unifying role in the history of the Netherlands. The reverse central disc bears a crowned monogram &quot;W&quot; (for King William I) surrounded by a laurel wreath. The badge hangs from a royal crown.

The star of the Knight Grand Cross is a silver, 8-pointed star with straight rays; the obverse of the badge of the Order, minus the crown, appears at its centre.

The breast cross of the Commander is completely identical to the obverse of the badge of the Order.

The ribbon of the Order is orange (House of Orange-Nassau) with blue (Nassau-blue) stripes near the border.

==Knighthood oath==
The oath to be taken by the accolade to the Military Order of William states: &quot;I swear that I shall conduct myself as a faithful and valiant Knight, to stand ever ready to defend King and Country with my Life, and with all my Powers to always strive to be worthy of this Distinction, which the King has bestowed upon me. So help me God almighty.&quot;

==Unit award==
To be awarded the Military William Order a military unit must distinguish itself in battle to such a degree as would warrant the personal presentation of the Military William Order. The unit&#x27;s Regimental Colour are decorated with the badge of the 4th class itself, which hangs from the finial of the pike. The version of the Military William Order for unit members is known as the Orange Lanyard. Only those who served in a military unit at the particular time of action are entitled to wear the Orange Lanyard.

The Orange Lanyard is worn as a cord around the right shoulder and can be worn simultaneously with the French or Belgian Fourragère of the Croix de Guerre. The Orange Lanyard is considered a permanent decoration and is worn for the duration of a military member&#x27;s career.

The military units or formations that were awarded the Military William Order or continue their traditions are:
* The 7th Field Battalion of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) (1849) – no longer existing
* The 3rd Field Battalion of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) (1877) – no longer existing
* The Marechaussee Corps of Aceh and Dependencies of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) (1930) – no longer existing
* The Royal Netherlands Air Force that continues the traditions of:
** the Military Air Arm in the Netherlands (18 May 1940) – no longer existing 
** the Military Air Arm of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) (1942) – no longer existing
* The Royal Netherlands Naval Aviation Service of the Royal Netherlands Navy (1942)
* The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division for gallantry during Operation Market Garden (1944)
* The &#x27;Prinses Irene&#x27; Fusilier Guards Regiment that continues the traditions of the Royal Netherlands &#x27;Prinses Irene&#x27; Brigade (1945)
* The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps (1946)
* The Royal Netherlands Navy Submarine Service of the Royal Netherlands Navy (1947)
* The &#x27;Van Heutsz&#x27; Regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army that continues the traditions of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) (1972)
* The Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade for gallantry during Operation Market Garden in 1944 (31 May 2006) – no longer existing
* The Korps Commandotroepen (15 March 2016)

Most military units or formations of the Netherlands and foreign armed forces were decorated as a consequence of their actions during the Second World War. In 2016 the Korps Commandotroepen were awarded the Military William Order for their actions in Afghanistan.

<text>The TSEC/KW-26, code named ROMULUS, was an encryption system used by the U.S. Government and, later, by NATO countries. It was developed in the 1950s by the National Security Agency (NSA) to secure fixed teleprinter circuits that operated 24 hours a day. It used vacuum tubes and magnetic core logic, replacing older systems, like SIGABA and the British 5-UCO, that used rotors and electromechanical relays.

A KW-26 system (transmitter or receiver) contained over 800 cores and approximately 50 vacuum-tube driver circuits, occupying slightly more than one half of a standard 19-inch rack. Most of the space in the rack and most of the 1 kW input power were required for the special-purpose vacuum tube circuits needed to provide compatibility with multiple input and output circuit configurations. The military services&#x27; requirements for numerous modes and speeds significantly increased costs and delayed delivery. NSA says it is doubtful that more than three or four of the possible configurations were ever used.

The KW-26 used an NSA-developed encryption algorithm based on shift registers. The algorithm produced a continuous stream of bits that were xored with the five bit Baudot teleprinter code to produce ciphertext on the transmitting end and plaintext on the receiving end. In NSA terminology, this stream of bits is called the key. The information needed to initialize the algorithm, what most cryptographers today would call the key, NSA calls a cryptovariable. Typically each KW-26 was given a new cryptovariable once a day.
NSA designed a common fill device (CFD), for loading the cryptovariable. It used a Remington Rand (UNIVAC) format punched card (45 columns, round holes). The operator inserted the daily key card into the CFD and closed the door securely, locking the card in place. Decks of cards were created by NSA and sent by courier. The cards were strictly accounted for.

Because the KW-26 used a stream cipher, if the same key card was ever used twice, the encryption could be broken. To prevent re-use, the card was automatically cut in half upon reopening the CFD. As the units aged, the card reader contacts became less dependable, and operators resorted to various tricks, such as hitting the card reader cover with a screwdriver, to get them to work properly. Card readers were cleaned and the spring loading of the contacts checked as part of the routine maintenance of the device.

Because the KW-26 sent a continuous stream of bits, it offered traffic-flow security. Someone intercepting the ciphertext stream had no way to judge how many real messages were being sent, making traffic analysis impossible. One problem with the KW-26 was the need to keep the receiver and transmitter units synchronized. The crystal controlled clock in the KW-26 was capable of keeping both ends of the circuit in sync for many hours, even when physical contact was lost between the sending and receiving units. This capability made the KW-26 ideally suited for use on unreliable HF radio circuits. However, when the units did get out of sync, a new key card had to be inserted at each end. The benefit of traffic-flow security was lost each time new cards were inserted. In practice, operational protocol led to the cards being replaced more often than was desirable to maintain maximum security of the circuit. This was especially so on radio circuits, where operators often changed the cards many times each day in response to a loss of radio connectivity. In any case, it was necessary to change the cards at least once per day to prevent the cypher pattern from repeating.

Early KW-26 units protected the CRITICOMM network, used to protect communications circuits used to coordinate signals intelligence gathering. The initial production order for this application, awarded to Burroughs in 1957, was for 1500 units. Other services demanded KW-26&#x27;s and some 14000 units were eventually built, beginning in the early 1960s, for the U.S. Navy, Army, Air Force, Defense Communications Agency, State Department and the CIA. It was provided to U.S. allies as well.

When the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; was captured by North Korea in 1968, KW-26&#x27;s were on board. In response, the NSA had modifications made to other units in the field, presumably changing the crypto algorithm in some way, perhaps by changing the shift register feedback taps. Starting in the mid-1980s, the KW-26 system was decommissioned by NSA, being replaced by the more advanced solid-state data encryptor, TSEC/KG-84.

<text>Paul Brentwood Henry (July 9, 1942 – July 31, 1993) was an American professor of political science and politician from Michigan. He was elected to five terms and served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1985 until his death from brain cancer in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1993.

==Early life and career==
Henry was born in Chicago and graduated from Pasadena High School, Pasadena, California, in 1959. His father Carl F. H. Henry, noted theologian, was one of the founders of Fuller Theological Seminary and the founding editor of &quot;Christianity Today&quot;. His mother, author Helga Bender Henry, was born in Cameroon, West Africa, the daughter of German born American missionaries.

Henry received a B.A. from Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois in 1963, and then was a Peace Corps volunteer in Liberia and Ethiopia from 1963 to 1965. Upon returning to the United States, he attended graduate school at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, earning a M.A. in 1968, and a PhD in 1970.

Henry was professor of political science at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan from 1970 to 1978.

==Political career==
From 1965 to 1970, while he was a graduate student at Duke, Henry served two stints as a staffer for Congressman John B. Anderson (R-IL). During 1968 and 1969, while Anderson was the third-ranking Republican in Congress, Henry&#x27;s job involved promoting good communication within the party caucus.

In 1974, after Henry had been at Calvin College for several years, Democrat Richard Vander Veen won the congressional seat centered on Grand Rapids, long held by Gerald Ford, in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Henry was subsequently asked to provide new direction to the Kent County Republican Party as its new chairman. The following year, Henry was appointed by Governor William Milliken to the Michigan State Board of Education, on which he served from 1975 to 1978.

Henry ran for an open seat in the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1978 and served in that body from 1979 to 1982, where he represented the 91st district, then moving up to serve one term in the Michigan State Senate, where he represented the 32nd district.

===Tenure in Congress===
In 1984, Henry was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 5th District to the U.S. House of Representatives, winning the open seat being vacated by Republican Congressman Harold S. Sawyer. The Grand Rapids-based district had historically been a Republican stronghold, but had fallen into Democratic hands after longtime congressman and House Minority Leader Gerald Ford gave it up to become Vice President of the United States (he ascended to the presidency a few months later). Sawyer had defeated Ford&#x27;s predecessor, Richard Vander Veen in 1976, but had faced some of the closest races the district had seen in memory.

In 1984, however, the district reverted to form, and Henry won with 62 percent of the vote. He was re-elected three more times without serious difficulty. After redistricting due to the United States 1990 Census, his district was renumbered as the 3rd district. Henry served in Congress for 8½ years, from January 3, 1985 until his death.

In the House of Representatives, Henry served on the committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space and Technology, and the Select Committee on Aging.

He was known for opposing federal funding of offensive artwork, but he did not join other Republicans who sought the complete defunding of federal support for the arts.

==Death==
In October 1992, two weeks before election day, Henry was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He underwent surgery a few days before he was re-elected to his fifth term in Congress. He regained strength briefly and was able to attend his swearing into the 103rd Congress on January 3, 1993, but then began to decline again.

Paul Henry died in Grand Rapids on July 31, 1993, at the age of 51, after having brain cancer for nine months. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Grand Rapids.

== Legacy ==
Henry was succeeded in Congress by Vern Ehlers, a fellow faculty member at Calvin College who had also succeeded Henry in the state senate.

Henry Hall at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids is named after Paul B. Henry. It houses the Biology department, three lecture halls, and several computer labs. The Paul B. Henry Congressional Internship supports a student from GVSU to work in the Washington, D.C. office of a member of the Michigan delegation with a scholarship from the Paul B. Henry Foundation.

M-6, a highway on the south side of Grand Rapids connecting Interstate 96 and Interstate 196, was named the Paul B. Henry Freeway. Construction on the highway began in 1997 and was completed in 2004, four years ahead of schedule.

Calvin College established The Paul B. Henry Institute for the Study of Christianity and Politics in 1997 to continue the work of integrating Christian faith and politics advanced by its namesake.

A multi use trail from Kentwood, through Caledonia, Middleville, and Hastings on through to Vermontville was named the Paul Henry–Thornapple Rail Trail.

<text>Wavertree is a district and suburb of Liverpool, in the county of Merseyside, England. It is a ward of Liverpool City Council, and its population at the 2011 census was 14,772. Located to the south and east of the city centre, it is bordered by various districts and suburbs such as Allerton, Edge Hill, Fairfield, Mossley Hill, Old Swan, and Toxteth.

==History==

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the name derives from the Old English words &quot;wæfre&quot; and &quot;treow&quot;, meaning &quot;wavering tree&quot;, possibly in reference to aspen trees common locally.
It has also been variously described as &quot;a clearing in a wood&quot; or &quot;the place by the common pond&quot;. In the past, the name has been spelt &quot;Watry&quot;, &quot;Wartre&quot;, &quot;Waurtree&quot;, &quot;Wavertre&quot; and &quot;Wavertree&quot;. The earliest settlement of Wavertree is attested to by the discovery of Bronze Age burial urns in Victoria Park in the mid-1860s, while digging the footings for houses, two of which were built for Patrick O Connor, patentee, ironmonger, merchant and chair to the Wavertree Local Board of Health.

The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; reference is &quot;Leving held &quot;Wauretreu&quot;. There are 2 carucates of land. It was worth 64 pence&quot;. Wavertree was formerly a township in the parish of Childwall in the West Derby Hundred, in 1866 Wavertree became a separate civil parish, from 1894 to 1895 Wavertree was an urban district, on 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1921 the parish had a population of 45,991.

Wavertree also boasts a village lock-up, commonly known as The Roundhouse, despite being octagonal in shape. Built in 1796, and later modified by prominent local resident and architect Sir James Picton, it was once used to detain local drunks. The lock-up was made a listed building in 1952.
A similar structure, Everton Lock-Up sometimes called Prince Rupert&#x27;s Tower, survives in Everton. The village green, on which Wavertree&#x27;s lock-up was built, is officially the only surviving piece of common land in Liverpool.

In 1895, the village of Wavertree was incorporated into the city of Liverpool. Buildings of interest include Holy Trinity Church, Liverpool Reform Synagogue, the Blue Coat School, and the Royal School for the Blind, all of which are situated on the same road. King David High School, a Jewish-affiliated school that also accepts students of other faiths and backgrounds, is situated in Wavertree and has a primary school attached to it. Wavertree Town Hall was built in 1872 as the headquarters of the Wavertree Local Board of Health. Rescued from demolition in 1979, the town hall is now a bar and restaurant.Wavertree is one of the areas in south Liverpool populated by students of Liverpool&#x27;s three universities, especially the Smithdown Road area. This road is known for &quot;The Smithdown Ten&quot; pub crawl, although the number of pubs in business varies from year to year. Wavertree is also home to the annual Smithdown Road Festival, with local bars and cafes hosting almost 200 bands every year. The community is ethnically diverse, with significant South Asian and black populations.

==Governance==
It has been represented in House of Commons by Paula Barker since 2019, of the Labour Party, in the parliamentary constituency of Liverpool Wavertree. 

There are two Liverpool City Council seats in Wavertree. Wavertree Garden Suburb represented by Julie Fadden of the Labour Party &amp; Wavertree Village represented by Laurence Sidorczuk of the Liberal Democrats.

==Education==
There are a number of both primary and secondary schools in this densely populated area of Liverpool. In addition to the aforementioned Blue Coat School, Royal School for the Blind, and King David High School, there is also Wavertree Church of England School, which was renamed from Trinity District in the 1990s. The school celebrated its 150th birthday in September 2017. There is another primary school on South Drive called Our Lady of Good Help. This used to be located in Chestnut Grove next to our Lady&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, which is now facing re-development. St Clare&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School is also situated off Smithdown Road.

==Wavertree Playground (The Mystery)==
Wavertree Playground, known locally as The Mystery, was one of the first purpose-built public playgrounds in the UK. Opened in 1895, it is based on land donated to Liverpool Corporation by an anonymous donor (hence its nickname) to be a venue for organised sports, and a place for children from the city&#x27;s schools to run about in, not a park for &quot;promenading&quot; in the Victorian tradition. The donor expressed the hope that the City Council &quot;might approve of giving it a fair trial for this purpose ... before appropriating it for any other use&quot;.

The land is currently home to Wavertree Athletics Centre, which boasts many sports facilities including tennis courts, an all-weather pitch, a bowling green, and an athletic track with grandstand. It also houses Liverpool Aquatics Centre, with two swimming pools, a sports hall, and a lifestyles fitness centre. The athletics centre has produced Olympic athletes such as Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who trains with the Liverpool Harriers team that has made its headquarters at the centre since 1990.

<text>Liver pate is a pâté and meat spread popular in Northern and Eastern Europe. Made from finely or coarsely ground pork liver and lard, it is similar to certain types of French and Belgian pâtés.

== Scandinavia ==
Liver pâté is a popular food item in Scandinavia, where it is known as (Denmark), (Norway) and (Sweden). It is made from a mixture of pork liver, lard, onion, flour, egg, salt, pepper and spices, poured into a loaf pan and then baked in the oven. The liver is usually finely ground, but coarsely ground variations are also made. Typical spices include allspice and some recipes also include a small amount of cured anchovy. In Norway, is made with a bit of pork meat.

 is served with bread in a variety of ways. It is served both hot and cold and can be bought premade in supermarkets, butcher shops and delicatessens. 
A popular everyday version is to spread cold on a slice of &quot;rugbrød&quot; (Danish dark wholemeal rye bread) and eat it as a simple open-faced sandwich. More extravagant variations include the &quot;smørrebrød&quot; known as &quot;Dyrlægens natmad&quot;. Swedes often use it on crispbread. It may be topped with a variety of accompaniments, such as pickled beets or cucumbers, raw onions, fried onions, fried bacon or slices of fresh cucumber. In Sweden, fresh cucumber and a bit of dill are sometimes used.

Warm servings of are eaten with either or white bread and traditionally accompanied by pickled beets or gherkins and either fried bacon or sautéed mushrooms.

In Denmark, was introduced in 1847 by the Frenchman François Louis Beauvais in Copenhagen. At that time it was considered a luxury dish, and was expensive. Today, it is a common and affordable food item. In two 1992 surveys, Danes ranked as their favorite sandwich topping. Stryhn&#x27;s is one of the main producers in Denmark with 85,000 units produced daily. The company was established in 1945 on the isle of Amager, east of Copenhagen. For the past few decades, their &quot;Stryhns&quot; brand has been the most popular in Denmark. In Denmark, is almost always sold in aluminium trays; this way it can go right in the oven to be served hot if preferred by the consumer.

<text>Wigbolt, Baron Ripperda (1535? – 16 July 1573) was the city governor of Haarlem when the city was under siege by the Spanish army in the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

==Biography==
Wigbolt Ripperda was the son of Baron Focko Ripperda van Winsum and Baroness Clara van Ewsum, and born in Winsum. The Ripperda family was one of the oldest and most powerful noble families in the Ommelanden, nowadays known as the province of Groningen in The Netherlands. Focko and Clara Ripperda had four sons: Peter, Asinge, Onno, Wigbolt and Johanna, a daughter.

Wigbolt studied in Geneva and Orléans, together with his brother Onno. There he studied Latin and other languages. In Geneva, where Calvin was preaching, he got into contact with Protestantism, the new religion that inspired the Dutch Revolt. He became a strong believer in Protestantism.

When he returned to Winsum he was involved in the wave of iconoclasm in the Netherlands (the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot;). On 14 September 1566 Wigbolt and his brothers, as well as two other men, broke into the church in Winsum and destroyed the statues of saints and the altar.

Wigbolt joined the army of the Prince of Orange, the geuzen, and became &quot;hopman&quot; . Until August 1572 he was commander of the guard of William van der Marck, Lord of Lumey, who brought him to the city of Haarlem. He became governor of Haarlem after that.

On 4 December, a week before the siege started, Ripperda &#x27;cleaned&#x27; the Sint-Bavokerk of all catholic symbols.

==Siege of Haarlem==
When it became clear that a large Spanish army under command of Don Fadrique was approaching the city he inspired the citizens and municipality of Haarlem not to give in to the demands of the Spanish king, but to fight and defend the city.

The city stayed loyal to the Prince of Orange and resisted the Spanish army in a 7-months siege. After this long and bitter siege the city had to surrender because of a lack of food and supplies. On 12 July 1573 the city officially surrendered to Don Fadrique.

==Death==
Ripperda was captured together with other soldiers and imprisoned in a church in Haarlem. On 16 July at 11.00 o&#x27;clock he was transferred to the Grote Markt, where he was beheaded. His brother Asinge, who was also in the city, was smuggled out of the city by a Spaniard.

Although the city was defeated, the siege of Haarlem had been so exhausting for the Spanish army that in the Siege of Alkmaar they were defeated.

His brother Onno died on 17 June 1580.

A number of streets and buildings in Haarlem and Winsum are named after Ripperda.

<doc id="1006123" wikidata="Q3063689" url="?curid=1006123" title="Walton, Liverpool">
<text>Walton is an area of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England, north of Anfield and east of Bootle and Orrell Park. Historically in Lancashire, it is largely residential, with a diverse population.

==History==
The name may derive from the same origin as Wales. The incoming Saxons called the earlier native inhabitants (the Celtic Britons) &quot;Walas&quot; or &quot;Wealas&quot;, meaning &quot;foreigner&quot;. Another possible etymology is &quot;Wald tun&quot;, Old English for &quot;Forest Town&quot;.

Walton&#x27;s recorded history starts with the death of Edward the Confessor, when Winestan held the manor of Walton. After the Norman conquest of 1066, Roger of Poitou included Walton in the lands he gave to his sheriff, Godfrey.

In 1200, King John gave Walton to Richard de Meath, who left it to his brother, Henry de Walton. Henry&#x27;s son William inherited the land, but died before his son Richard was of age, so Richard was made a ward of Nicholas de la Hose by the Earl of Derby and the estate was managed by nobles outside the family for a time.

Walton was then held by the de Walton family until Roger de Walton&#x27;s death in the 15th century, when it was split through marriage between the Crosse, Chorley and Fazakerley families. Walton Manor later passed through the Breres and Atherton families until it was sold in 1804 to Liverpool banker Thomas Leyland. Some of the Walton land also passed to the Earl of Derby and the Sefton family.

From 1894 to 1895 Walton on the Hill was an urban district, Walton then became part of Liverpool Borough Council. In 1921 the civil parish named Walton on the Hill had a population of 83,290. On 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool.
Hartley&#x27;s Village was built in the 19th century to house workers from the Hartley&#x27;s Jam Factory.

===20th century===
Moulded plastics company Dunlop had its UK head office and manufacturing plant on what is now the Cavendish Retail Park (off Rice Lane and opposite the former Walton Hospital) until the mid-1990s. In September 1980, a severe fire at the plant closed Rice Lane and residents were told to stay indoors due to hazardous atmospheric pollution. The fire caused so much damage that the plant had to be demolished, and only part of the site remained until its closure. The building used as the main headquarters was left abandoned for many years until a Chinese restaurant was opened in the late 1990s on the site. The last remaining plant, on Cavendish Drive, was demolished in 2004 to make way for a housing estate.
===21st century===
On August 3, 2024, Walton was affected by the 2024 United Kingdom riots: 300 people gathered near County Road Mosque and the Spellow Lane Library Hub and a local shop were set on fire.

==Notable buildings==
In 1884, the Liverpool Inner City Zoological Park and Gardens opened on what is now the Cavendish Retail Park. Its star attraction was &quot;Pongo&quot;, a chimpanzee who lived in the Monkey House. The zoo itself was known for its large bronze Liver birds which sat atop of the entrance gates, and its splendid beauty. The gardens closed in the early 1900s and the only surviving remains is the Ticket Booth, which is now a pizza takeaway beside The Plough function rooms (formerly a public house). Rice Lane City Farm is also in Walton, at the end of Rawcliffe Road, occupying the land that once was Liverpool Parochial Cemetery.

The Prince of Wales pub on Rice Lane was nicknamed &quot;The Sod House&quot; by Edward VII, after making a royal visit to the zoo and entering it for refreshments, perhaps because the landlord used clods of earth (&quot;sods&quot;) draped over the beer barrels to keep them cool.

The former Shell garage on Rice Lane (now a used car dealership) was once the official workshop of Ferrari for their race team when competing at Aintree Grand Prix course in the 1950s.
Walton Town Hall was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Queens Drive fly-over. The side wall, which includes the name etched in stone, still stands on the northbound side of the A59 at the fly-over. The wall is currently owned by Croppers garage which occupies the space.

Walton was also once the location of Walton Hospital, on Rice Lane. Several famous Liverpudlians, including Paul McCartney and Joe Fagan, were born at the hospital. The hospital was also once a regional centre for neurology and neurosurgery. As demand for services continued to increase the capacity for patients at the relatively small Walton Hospital site decreased and in 1998 all neurosurgical services were transferred to the newly built Walton Centre, on the same site as Aintree University Hospital in Fazakerley.

Walton Hospital started life in the late 19th century as West Derby Union Workhouse and nearby Walton Parochial cemetery contains many tens of thousands of unmarked and uncelebrated &quot;common&quot; graves of the poor who depended on it for sustenance. This cemetery, which now houses the City Farm, also holds the grave of Robert Noonan, also known as Robert Tressell, who fell ill and died in Liverpool while waiting for a ship to emigrate to America. In 2019, Tressell was commemorated with a march to his graveside led by a brass band.

Clock View Hospital is a psychiatric facility standing near the old grounds of the original Walton Hospital. It is a medium level facility consisting of 5 inpatient wards and a neurological unit within the same building (Walton Centre). It was purpose built in 2014 as a state of the art psychiatric care facility and opened to patients in 2015. Since then, it has won many awards for outstanding care and treatment for patients and in 2018 Clock View won a Sustainable Health and Care award (Capital Projects) for its building design efficiency. 

Walton is home to Goodison Park football stadium, which was built in 1892 as the first purpose built football stadium in England and the home of Everton Football Club, who have remained there ever since; although little of the original stadium structure now exists. They had previously played at Anfield Stadium on the opposite side of Stanley Park, which then became the home of Liverpool Football Club.
==Governance==
The Liverpool Walton constituency was long a bastion of the left in the Labour Party with a Marxist influence stretching back to the 1950s. This came to a head when the Walton by-election in 1991 saw the Labour Party candidate, Peter Kilfoyle, defeat Walton Real Labour candidate Lesley Mahmood, a member of the Militant group, in the by-election caused by the death of left-wing MP Eric Heffer.

As of 2017, the Member of Parliament representing Walton is Labour&#x27;s Dan Carden. The majority of councillors representing Walton are Labour.

== Geography ==
Walton borders a number of other areas, some considered inner-city and some considered outer suburbs, these include Clubmoor, Anfield, Kirkdale, Norris Green, Bootle and Orrell Park.

Walton has seven roads that are locally referred to as the ship roads. These roads are: Mauretania, Lusitania, Saxonia, Ivernia, Sylvania, Woolhope and Haggerston. Five of these roads are named after Cunard ships, Mauretania, Lusitania, Saxonia, Ivernia and Sylvania, a reference to Cunard&#x27;s former headquarters in Liverpool.

==Transport==
Walton is connected to Liverpool City Centre via the A59 and the A580 (East Lancashire Road).

There are two railway stations in Walton on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. Rice Lane railway station (formerly Preston Road) is on the Kirkby branch and Walton railway station (formerly Walton Junction) is on the Ormskirk branch.

The North Liverpool Extension Line, still in use until the 1970s, included Warbreck railway station in Walton Vale and Spellow railway station, on the Canada Dock Branch near Spellow Lane. Warbreck railway station is no longer in use, and the only remains are on a bicycle path underneath the shops. The path itself is part of the Trans Pennine Trail.

Walton on the Hill railway station was by the Queens Drive flyover, on the Rice Lane side heading southbound. Though the railway station became disused in 1918, the line was used for transporting goods to Liverpool docks via the tunnel which runs through the Walton-Kirkdale area; this leads to Kirkdale railway station and on to Sandhills railway station.

What is now a bike path behind the site of the Hartley&#x27;s and Jacobs factory used to be Fazakerley Junction, a train depot used until the 1960s.

<doc id="1006129" wikidata="Q130413" url="?curid=1006129" title="Louise of the Netherlands">
<text>Louise of the Netherlands (Wilhelmina Frederika Alexandrine Anna Louise; 5 August 1828 – 30 March 1871), also called Lovisa, was Queen of Sweden and Norway from 8 July 1859 until her death in 1871 as the wife of King Charles XV &amp; IV.

==Youth==
Princess Louise was born on 5 August 1828 in The Hague. Her father was Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, the second child of King William I of the Netherlands and Wilhelmina of Prussia. Her mother Louise was the eighth child of King Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her education was to large extent entrusted to her Belgian governess Victoire Wauthier, and she studied French, German, English, Russian and piano.

In 1849, Louise was selected as a suitable spouse for Crown Prince Charles, the son of King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway and Josephine of Leuchtenberg. The marriage was arranged after the negotiations to arrange a marriage between Charles and her cousin Princess Louise of Prussia had failed. King Oscar I of Sweden wished to secure royal family connections between the new Bernadotte dynasty and the old royal dynasties of Europe, and a Protestant princess was also seen as a necessary queen of the Protestant Sweden-Norway after two Catholic predecessors. Louise fulfilled these credentials, and a great dowry was expected from the rich House of Orange-Nassau. Cabinet secretary L Manderström was sent to inspect her, and diplomatically let it be known in his report that Louise had an excellent education and a good character but that she was not attractive. In August 1849, a meeting was arranged between Louise and Charles in the Hague. Reportedly, Louise fell in love with Charles and felt an immediate attraction, while Charles in contrast was disappointed in her appearance. Charles, however, was convinced to agree to the marriage by the King.

The engagement was officially declared in February 1850. The expectations of her great fortune was debated in Sweden, both in the parliament during the discussions about the allowance, and in the radical press, who suggested that the monarch would now be able to finance the construction of the Swedish rail road net by himself. In reality, however, her dowry turned out to be very small. During the engagement, Louise studied the Swedish language and history; she never learnt Norwegian, however. Because the Dutch government had supported the marriage, she did not have to renounce her rights to the Dutch throne upon her marriage.

==Crown princess==
Louise left Germany by a Swedish boat from Travemünde and arrived to Sweden with her parents and sister Marie, who were present at her wedding. Princess Louise and Crown Prince Charles married at &quot;Storkyrkan&quot; in Stockholm on 19 June 1850. She was given Countess Elisabet Piper as her &quot;hovmästarinna&quot; (senior lady-in-waiting) and Ottiliana Sparre and Ulrika Sprengsporten as maids-of-honor. After the wedding, her father-in-law the King took her on a tour through Sweden to introduce her to the country.

The relationship between Louise and Charles was unhappy. The couple had dissimilar personalities, with Louise being introverted, shy and with a preference for a simple life, and Charles extraverted and with a love for parties and social life. Louise was reportedly unhappily in love with Charles, who found her unattractive and was unfaithful to her, which pained her considerably.

From 1852 until 1860, Charles had a relationship with Josephine Sparre, maid of honor to Louise, which caused a scandal. Sparre was described as so domineering that the Crown Princess and her maid of honor were said to have changed places with each other, with Louise being the lady-in-waiting to Josephine Sparre rather than the other way around. Fritz von Dardel described Sparre: &quot;The lady in question is a great favorite of the Crown Prince as well as with the Crown Princess, and she governs them both entirely in everything about their daily life. Gifted with an unusual talent to please and make herself indispensable, she has managed to capture the Crown Prince to a strange degree.&quot;

Louise was given sympathy and Charles was considered to be treating her with neglect. A known episode which attracted attention took place at the birthday garden party of Louise at Drottningholm Palace in 1857, when the Crown Prince proposed a toast to his &quot;secret love&quot; with both Louise and Josephine Sparre present. This caused a scene, and his brother, Prince Oscar, reprimanded him indirectly by asking his own spouse, Sofia of Nassau, to toast with him. This scene caused Louise to burst into tears and suffer a nervous attack.

Louise bore two children; Princess Louise in 1851, and Prince Carl Oscar in 1852. Due to complications that arose at the birth of Prince Carl Oscar, Louise was unable to have any more children. In 1854, her 2-year-old son, Carl Oscar, died of pneumonia. As the Salic law prevailed at that time in Sweden (having been introduced by the constitution of 1809), Louise&#x27;s daughter was not eligible to ascend the throne. Charles was very chagrined and disappointed because this meant that his progeny would not be the next monarch of Sweden; his heir would be his brother Oscar. Louise offered Charles a divorce so he could remarry and produce a male heir, but he declined the offer.

Crown Princess Louise was not considered a social success, and her timid and shy nature was not appreciated in society because of her official position. Between 1857 and 1859, Crown Prince Charles was named regent during the incapacity of his father, and she took over the representational duties of first lady from her mother-in-law. During her spouse&#x27;s reign as prince regent, she was described in the well-known court chronicle of Fritz von Dardel: 
:&quot;A more lovable and talented woman would have entirely recreated the atmosphere in this circle and also exerted a good influence upon the Prince, who, of a good nature, easily let himself be led by those he likes, especially women. Although good, dutiful and not one to plot, the crown princess lacks higher qualities. She is a good housewife but thinks only of her husband, herself and those closest to her and she has not the good influence on him which her good character gives her the right to have. Because of her inborn shyness, she lacks the courage to meddle in his affairs, and her only wish is to gain his love. With one word; she seems not mature enough for her great task&quot;.

==Queen==


Louise became Queen of Sweden and Norway at the death of her father-in-law on 8 July 1859. She was the first queen of the union of Sweden-Norway to be crowned in both Sweden and Norway, as Norway had refused to crown her two predecessors because they were Catholics. Louise was crowned Queen of Sweden in Stockholm on 3 May 1860 and Queen of Norway in Trondheim on 5 August 1860. She was the first queen to be crowned in Norway since the Middle Ages. Louise was very celebrated in Norway during her stay there. 
Louise exerted no influence upon state affairs whatsoever, nor did she show any ambition to do so. The fact that she did not meddle in politics was seen as a good role model and was favorably compared to previous queens who had, such as her predecessor, Queen Josephine, and this view is described in a contemporary encyclopedia from 1864: &quot;At last, the two kingdoms can rejoice in the blessing of again having a Queen, who does not proceed the governmental power with her own thoughts, but calmly observes the natural process through King and legitimate authority. Loved by the Swedish people, she has enough opportunity for her noble wish to occupy herself in charity&quot;. She did not lack political views, however: she disliked the parliamentary reform of 1865, and she did not share the anti-German view of Charles.

Louise preferred to use her royal position for philanthropy, which was also expected of a female member of the royalty and upper class. She founded the charity organisations: &quot;Kronprinsessan Lovisas vårdanstalt för sjuka barn&quot; (The Crown Princess Louise&#x27;s Asylum for Sick Children) in 1854; &quot;Femöreföreningen till inrättande av barnhem i Lappland&quot; (The Five Öre Foundation for Orphanages in Lappland) in 1864; 
&quot;Lotten Wennbergs fond för hjälpbehövande&quot; (The Lotten Wennberg Foundation for the Needing) in 1864; &quot;Drottning Lovisas understödsförening&quot; 
(The Queen Louise Charity Foundation) in 1866; &quot;Allmänna institutet för dövstumma och blinda&quot; (The Public Institution of the Deaf and Blind); 
&quot;Sällskapet för inrättande av småbarnsskolor&quot; (The Society for Elementary Education School&#x27;s Foundation); &quot;Den fosterländska föreningen till uppmuntran av själverksamhet för framtida oberoende&quot; (The Patriotic Society for the Encouragement of Self Employments for Future Independence); and the &quot;Tysta skolan, eller uppfostrings- och undervisningsanstalten för dövstumma barn&quot; (Silent School, or The Nursing- and Education Institution for Deaf and Mute Children) by Johanna Berglind.
Louise was interested in music and history, and took piano lessons from the Swedish pianist Adolf Fredrik Lindblad. She translated work from English and Dutch into Swedish, which she sold for charitable purposes. Louise and her daughter were students of Nancy Edberg, the pioneer of swimming for women: swimming was initially not regarded as being entirely proper for ladies, but when the Queen and her daughter Princess Louise supported it by attending the lessons from 1862, swimming quickly became fashionable and accepted for women. 
Louise employed Sweden&#x27;s first female dentist, Rosalie Fougelberg, as her official personal dentist in 1867. Among her own personal friends was Aurore von Haxthausen, who was her maid of honor her entire time as queen, as well as Countess Stefanie Hamilton, who served as her Mistress of the Robes in 1859–60: the correspondence of Louise and Stefanie Hamilton is preserved. She also kept in contact with her family and her old governess by correspondence.

Queen Louise preferred a quiet and anonymous family life and preferred to avoid ceremonial and representational duties whenever she could, some times by pretending to be ill. King Charles, however, did not like to appear without her at formal occasions and occasionally forced her to be present. On one occasion, he is known to have said to her that she would have to attend, otherwise: &quot;The old women might think there is something wrong with you!&quot; In 1866, for example, Charles made her open the General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1866) in his place.

King Charles XV loved parties and masquerades, and his court life at Ulriksdal Palace was compared to that at Versailles and was in some circles considered to shame the name of the monarchy, expressed by the vicar Christoffer Bruun in 1881: &quot;It still causes as shiver that the highest power of the church was placed in the hands of this degenerated King, who has filled the whole nation with talk of his debauched life.&quot; Louise was given an important part to play in his court life as the Queen, and upon the death of Queen Dowager Desirée, who had occupied the Queen&#x27;s wing in the Stockholm Royal Palace until her death in 1860, Charles redecorated it for Louise and had a luxurious Venetian Mirror hall made to her reception room, which was much talked about (it was later removed by his successor). Her court was headed by Wilhelmina Bonde almost her entire tenure as queen. Reportedly, Louise suffered from her spouse&#x27;s adultery and did her best to compete with her rivals and entertain him, and her mother-in-law advised her to remove and marry away her maids of honor when Charles became attracted to them. Charles had a relationship with Hanna Styrell from 1860 until 1869 and with Wilhelmine Schröder from 1869 until his death, except from his more temporary relationships. 
Charles was very fond of their daughter; however, Louise was worried that he treated their daughter too much like a son at a time when gender roles were considered extremely important, allowing her more freedom than what was considered to be suitable for a girl at that time.

Louise suffered from bad health. On at least one occasion, during a boat trip on Mälaren, she suffered some kind of a fit (possibly an epileptic seizure from contemporary descriptions), which was interpreted to have been a hysterical reaction to her husband&#x27;s neglect. The court gathered to conceal her from public view, and the King quickly took her below deck. In this issue, it is reported that: &quot;Lovisa could at any time faint and in connection to this, she could have what is called nerve- or cramp-attacks&quot;. In 1864, during a visit to court by a former lover of Charles, Josephine Sparre, Fritz von Dardel noted: &quot;Initially the Queen is said to have felt worried for this visit; one evening, Her Majesty was about to have convulsions in the billiard hall, but this they attempted to conceal by claiming that it was caused by her chamberlain Liljenkrantz, who was supposed to have pushed her accidentally with his billiard pole...&quot;

In 1870, Queen Louise visited the Netherlands to be present at the death bed of her mother. Upon her return to Stockholm, Charles XV fell sick and she nursed him. Exhausted, she contracted pneumonia during a walk by carriage. On her death bed, she had long conversations with her family, which have been described as dramatic. Her daughter claimed: &quot;It was as if mother exposed her entire life to us&quot;. Louise asked Charles to forgive her everything in which she could have failed him, to which he responded by accusing himself, after which both he and his mother Josephine reportedly fainted because they were so moved.

Louise died on 30 March 1871.

<text>Listen Up is an American sitcom television series created by Jeff Martin, that aired on CBS from September 20, 2004, until April 25, 2005. The sitcom was based loosely on the life and exploits of the popular sportswriter and sports-media personality Tony Kornheiser. Its principal executive producer was Jason Alexander, who was also the lead actor. Despite decent-to-good ratings, the show was canceled by CBS on May 18, 2005; &quot;rising production costs&quot; was the major reason officially given for the cancellation.

==Premise==
Tony Kleinman is a Philadelphia based sports show host whose sidekick is Bernie Widmer, a former NFL player; together they host the TV show &quot;Listen Up&quot;. While Tony does talk about sports on the show and in his newspaper column, he strays away occasionally to talk about the daily exploits of his family: his wife, Dana, a fund-raiser coordinator; his son, Mickey, a 15-year-old golf prodigy, and Megan, his 14-year-old, know-it-all, smart-mouthed, soccer-playing daughter.

==Cast and characters==
* Jason Alexander as Tony Kleinman, a co-host of &quot;Listen Up&quot;, a sports talk show
* Wendy Makkena as Dana Kleinman, an administrator at Philadelphia Zoo 
* Daniella Monet as Megan Kleinman, the teenage daughter of Tony
* Will Rothhaar as Mickey Kleinman, the teenage son of Tony
* Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Bernie Widmer, a retired NFL player and a co-host of &quot;Listen Up&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Critical reaction was largely negative. &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Robert Bianco wrote that the show makes the &quot;mistake of trying to build a star vehicle around a second banana&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review called it &quot;a rickety vehicle for Jason Alexander&quot;. Critics disagreed on the supporting cast – while &quot;USA Today&quot; noted, &quot;When &#x27;Listen Up&#x27; focuses on its supporting cast, the show works&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to a &quot;stiff supporting cast&quot;. Matt Rouse of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;Forget about the &#x27;Seinfeld&#x27; curse, this is just mediocre material and bad casting.&quot;

===Ratings===
The premiere episode drew 11.8 million viewers, while the final episode drew 8.9 million viewers.

<text>Hunt&#x27;s Cross is a suburb of Liverpool, England. It is located on the southern edge of the city, bordered by the suburbs of Woolton, Allerton, Speke and the town of Halewood in the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley.

==History==
Hunt&#x27;s Cross was the name given to the ancient cross-roads at Speke Road, Hillfoot Avenue and Woodend Avenue, which formed the southern boundary of Much Woolton. The available evidence indicates that the cross-roads was called Hunt&#x27;s Cross because of fox hunts meeting there before setting off. There was also a nearby monument called &#x27;Hunt&#x27;s Folly&#x27;, shown on historical maps along with Honey Hall, Woodend Farm and Rose Farm. The &#x27;Liverpool Hunt&#x27; is commemorated by a collection of fine china tableware by Booths.
In the 1960s the medieval stone pedestal of the village cross had to be moved a short distance, to the corner of Hillfoot Road and Speke Road, to allow Hillfoot Avenue to be widened. There are similar crosses in the nearby villages of Cronton, Woolton, and Garston. Local folklore says that whoever takes the stone shall be possessed with the power of the Hunt.

==Description==

Hunt&#x27;s Cross is a typical affluent suburban area, the housing being almost entirely semi-detached or detached, much being late Victorian or Edwardian in origin, with a number of 1930s developments.

Hunt&#x27;s Cross Village is located at the ancient cross-roads of Speke Road, Hillfoot Avenue and Woodend Avenue. It is one of the most complete villages in Liverpool, boasting: a Grade II listed 19th century railway station; village green; a village market square; Post Office; churches; pubs and restaurants; several banks; various and numerous shops and businesses. Hunts Cross JMI primary school is also nearby.

A large Asda supermarket can be found in the western part of the suburb, with a cafe, travel agents, fast food restaurants and other businesses in the complex. This complex is located on the site of the former Triumph Speke car factory where the TR7 sports car was produced.

Located opposite the railway station was a large house where the actress Rita Tushingham grew up, on farmland originally owned by the Tushingham family. Some of the houses built with bricks from the since-demolished house are still in existence today along Ashton Drive. The Tushinghams gave the land, where the house had stood, to the council, with the proviso that it was to be used to build a library for the community. A mobile library came here once a week up until the late 1990s when the nearby school opened up its library to the public. Subsequently, Merseytravel wanted to use this land as a bus turning circle but was stopped by Tushingham, and the Hunts Cross Residents Association, as this was in breach of contract for the land&#x27;s usage.

There are two places of worship locally: St Columba&#x27;s URC and St Hilda&#x27;s CoE. St Andrew&#x27;s RC has now been demolished and sold for housing. The 28th Allerton Scout Troop was based at St Columba&#x27;s URC. It started in 1955, but has since been merged with the 33rd Allerton Scout Troop. A local drama group previously existed at St Columba&#x27;s, where Rita Tushingham once performed.

==Transport==
The area is served by Hunts Cross station, the southern terminus of the Merseyrail Northern Line to Liverpool city centre, Southport, Kirkby and Ormskirk. Northern and East Midlands Railway services also run to Manchester and Warrington.

Regular buses run along Speke Road, Hillfoot Avenue and Mackets Lane connecting with most of Liverpool, including routes into the city centre, Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Speke, and also round the ring road to East and North Liverpool.

==Notable residents==
*Josh Bolt, actor best known for his role as Rob Dawson in &quot;Benidorm (British TV series)&quot;, grew up here.
*George Harrison, composer/musician/activist and co-founder of The Beatles, lived here from 1962 to 1965.
*John Reppion, writer, husband of Leah Moore
*Rita Tushingham, actress best known for her roles in &quot;The Bed-Sitting Room&quot; and Carla Lane&#x27;s &quot;Bread&quot;
*Jonathan Harvey, writer, grew up here

<text>Alabama Adventure &amp; Splash Adventure (previously known as VisionLand, Alabama Adventure, Splash Adventure and Alabama Splash Adventure) is a water park and amusement park in Bessemer, Alabama. It is owned by Koch Family Parks, which consists of members of the family who formerly had minority ownership in Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari.

==History==

Originally known as VisionLand, the park was built largely as a result of efforts by Fairfield mayor Larry Langford. Eleven cities came together to form the West Jefferson Amusement and Public Park Authority and with help from the Alabama Legislature, the group borrowed $60 million to build the park. Construction began in March 1997, and the park opened for business on May 23, 1998. The park opened with four major areas, including &quot;Celebration City Theme Park&quot;, &quot;Steel Waters Water Park&quot;, a children&#x27;s area called &quot;Marvel City&quot;, and a shopping/dining area known as &quot;Main Street&quot;.

In 1999, the park expanded, adding Wilde River Gorge, a river rapids attraction. Dino Domain, a dinosaur-themed walk through exhibit featuring animatronic dinosaurs, was built in the woods behind Main Street but closed after the season.

In 2001, Wild River Gorge reopened with minor adjustments along with Stratosfear Screamer, an S&amp;S Power twin tower attraction.

The park filed Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2002, and only operated Steel Waters. Themeparks LLC, an amusement park operator known for their success with Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky, made a bid to buy VisionLand, but withdrew it when the price for the park became too high. The park was then purchased by Southland Entertainment Group for $5.25 million, a loss of approximately $26 million in public funds.

In 2003, Visionland (uncapitalizing the &quot;L&quot;) reopened with &quot;Magic Adventure Theme Park&quot;, &quot;Splash Beach Water Park&quot;, &quot;Marvel City&quot;, and &quot;Celebration Street&quot;. Magic Adventure received a scrambler attraction called Wild Scrambler and Splash Beach received a wave pool named Kahuna Waves and a nine-story-tall free fall slide called Acapulco Drop. Starting that season park guests had the option to buy tickets to either the amusement park or the water park or a combo ticket to both parks.

Splash Beach received a new water attraction called Splashdown!, a toilet bowl-style ride in 2004.

In 2005, Magic Adventure opened the first new roller coaster since the park&#x27;s opening named Zoomerang, a Vekoma Boomerang roller coaster relocated from Sydney, Australia. The park also re-opened one of the former attractions named Cahaba Falls, a log flume attraction. It was later known as Woodchuck Run. The park held naming contests for both attractions on its website. The theme park was visited by approximately 345,000 people, making the park Alabama&#x27;s second-most popular tourist destination according to the Bureau of Tourism and Travel and trailing only the Birmingham Zoo.

Southland announced in 2006, the rebranding of the park under the &quot;Alabama Adventure&quot; name, along with major expansion plans, including a hotel with an indoor water park, an RV park, and other amenities. Magic Adventure was renamed &quot;Magic City USA&quot; to reflect the new theming strategy. The park also announced plans for a summer concert series, featuring popular musical acts and artists. The number of visitors to Alabama Adventure rose to more than 388,000. It was the winner of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;2007 Attraction of the Year&quot;.

In 2007, the park added two new attractions, including Vertigo, one of the original attractions of VisionLand, which had been removed in 2003, and Salamander Bay, a re-themed children&#x27;s play area at Splash Beach formerly known as Quarry Bay. The summer concert series returned to the park and became an annual event.

Southland Entertainment sold the park to Adrenaline Family Entertainment, a group of former executives of Six Flags in 2008. Southland concentrated on developing the remaining acreage that it owns adjacent to the park, with plans for hotels, an RV park, and other amenities.

In 2009, the park announced the first major expansion since 2005, and the first to Splash Beach since 2004. The expansion included a new attraction from WhiteWater West called &quot;UpSurge!&quot;, a 216-foot flume slide with a vertical half pipe ending in a 25,000-gallon splash pool. The park also combined both parks into one ticket price.

The park began promoting a casting call for new &quot;indoor theatrical entertainment&quot; called &quot;Beat Street&quot; that premiered in the brand new Star Theater in 2010. The park also relaunched its website, branding the park as Alabama Adventure Water and Theme Park.

Buzzsaw Falls, a SkyTrans Manufacturing Shoot the Chutes ride was added in 2011, but only lasted for one summer. It was located between the parks Celebration Street and Stratos Fear Screamer tower ride. This ride was purchased by Schlitterbahn in Corpus Christi, Texas where it was renamed &quot;Padre Plunge&quot;.

Adrenaline Family Entertainment sold the park on January 5, 2012, to General Attractions LLC, a company created by the former owners of the park who previously sold the park in 2008. It was announced on April 5, 2012 that the amusement park section would be closed, leaving only water rides. The park was renamed Splash Adventure for its 2012 opening season. Also for 2012, three new attractions were added to the water park. One of their new attractions was called the &quot;Mist-ical Maze&quot; where in this attraction you go through a maze that has trigger water chutes and many other surprises. The second new attraction was a wipeout designed ride from WhiteWater West called &quot;Wipeout Adventure Course&quot; and the third new attraction was a zip-line that goes around the waterpark. There was a &quot;Dive-In Movie&quot; at Kahuna Waves every Friday night from Memorial Day weekend to the end of July.

In March 2014, Koch Family Parks, founded by former Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari CEO Dan Koch and his sister Natalie, purchased the park. New additions to the park included five new kids rides consisting of a new kids roller coaster, a train, two boat rides, mini helicopters and a laser maze.

In 2015 Rampage, the park&#x27;s signature wooden roller coaster, reopened after a complete restoration.

In 2018, the park added new attractions including a rocking tugboat, scrambler, a fast-spinning ride, a yo-yo swing ride, a miniature children&#x27;s train ride, and a children&#x27;s water slide complex. They also introduced a weekend autumn festival in October of that same year. A year later, for the 2019 season, the park introduced three new attractions; Freefall, a 75 foot tall water slide; Galleon, a pirate ship ride; and Twister, a body slide located by Freefall.

On Christmas Day (December 25, 2020), following a month-long teaser campaign, Alabama Adventure announced a new addition for the 2021 season; Rocket Racer, a new six-lane mat racer water slide, which would stand more than tall and represent their largest waterpark expansion to date.

For 2022, this amusement park introduced &quot;Cheddar Chase&quot;, a wild mouse roller coaster ride previously from Lake Winnepesaukah in Georgia and Self Powered Bikes for kids to replace &quot;Crank and Roll&quot;. In addition, its water park attraction &quot;Castaway Island&quot; was renamed &quot;Cocoa Island&quot;.

==Incidents and accidents==
* In 1999, when the park was called Visionland, five people were injured when a raft on the Wild River Gorge rapids ride overturned.
* In 2001, a raft on the Wild River Gorge filled with park employees overturned when the employees rocked the boat. No one was injured.
* In August 2009, a family of three and one other park visitor were injured when the Wild River Gorge&#x27;s boat capsized. Witnesses said that the family&#x27;s boat hit an empty boat and was overturned. The family was underwater for approximately 20 seconds.
* In June 2011, a fight broke out between several youths and spread throughout the park. One guest described it as a &quot;borderline riot&quot;. The Bessemer Police were called to the park and no more guests were allowed into the park. It was blamed on a &quot;$10 before 10AM&quot; promotion the park ran.
*In June 2018, a ten-year-old boy hit his head while floating along the Warrior River. Lifeguards came to his aid and the boy was subsequently sent to Children&#x27;s Hospital.

<doc id="1006138" wikidata="Q919236" url="?curid=1006138" title="Hiroshi Sugimoto">
<text>is a Japanese photographer and architect. He leads the Tokyo-based architectural firm New Material Research Laboratory.

==Early life and education==
Hiroshi Sugimoto was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He reportedly took his earliest photographs in high school, photographing film footage of Audrey Hepburn as it played in a movie theater. In 1970, Sugimoto studied politics and sociology at Rikkyō University in Tokyo. In 1974, he retrained as an artist and received his BFA in Fine Arts at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California. Afterwards, Sugimoto settled in New York City. He soon started working as a dealer of Japanese antiquities in Soho.

==Work==
Sugimoto has spoken of his work as an expression of &#x27;time exposed&#x27;, or photographs serving as a time capsule for a series of events in time. His work also focuses on transience of life, and the conflict between life and death.

Sugimoto is also deeply influenced by the writings and works of Marcel Duchamp, as well as the Dadaist and Surrealist movements as a whole. He has also expressed a great deal of interest in late 20th century modern architecture.

His use of an 8×10 large-format camera and extremely long exposures has garnered Sugimoto a reputation as a photographer of the highest technical ability. He is equally acclaimed for the conceptual and philosophical aspects of his work.

===&quot;Dioramas&quot;, &quot;In Praise of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Portraits&quot;===
Sugimoto began his work with &quot;Dioramas&quot; in 1976, a series in which he photographed displays in natural history museums. (A polar bear on a fake ice floe contemplates his fresh-killed seal; vultures fight over carrion in front of painted skies; exotic monkeys hoot in a plastic jungle.) Initially the pictures were shot at the American Museum of Natural History, a place he returned for later dioramas in 1982, 1994, and 2012. Where many of the earlier silver gelatin prints – including &quot;Polar Bear&quot; (1976), his first photograph from the &quot;Diorama&quot; series – present animals, a number of the 2012 photographs including &quot;Mixed Deciduous Forest&quot; and &quot;Olympic Rain Forest&quot; focus on natural landscapes. The cultural assumption that cameras always show us reality tricks many viewers into assuming the animals in the photos are real until they examine the pictures carefully.

His series &quot;Portraits&quot;, begun as a commission by the Deutsche Guggenheim in 1999, is based on a similar idea. In that series, Sugimoto photographs wax figures of Henry VIII and his wives. These wax figures are based on portraits from the 16th century and when taking the picture Sugimoto attempts to recreate the lighting that would have been used by the painter. Focusing on Madame Tussaud&#x27;s in London, its branch in Amsterdam and a wax museum in Ito, Japan, Sugimoto took three-quarter view photos, using 8-by-10-inch negatives, of the most realistic wax figures. They are typically taken against a black background. &quot;In Praise of Shadows&quot; (1998) is a series of photographs based on Gerhard Richter&#x27;s paintings of burning candles.

===&quot;Theatres&quot;===
In 1978, Sugimoto&#x27;s &quot;Theatres&quot; series involved photographing old American movie palaces and drive-ins with a folding 4x5 camera and tripod, opening his camera shutter and exposing the film for the duration of the entire feature-length movie, the film projector providing the sole lighting. The luminescent screen in the centre of the composition, the architectural details and the seats of the theatre are the only subjects that register owing to the long exposure of each photograph, while the unique lighting gives the works a surreal look, as a part of Sugimoto&#x27;s attempt to reveal time in photography. Sugimoto discovered that &quot;Different movies give different brightnesses. If it&#x27;s an optimistic story, I usually end up with a bright screen; if it&#x27;s a sad story, it&#x27;s a dark screen. Occult movie? Very dark.&quot;

===&quot;Seascapes&quot;===
In 1980 he began working on an ongoing series of photographs of the sea and its horizon, &quot;Seascapes&quot;, in locations all over the world, using an old-fashioned large-format camera to make exposures of varying duration (up to three hours). The locations range from the English Channel and the Cliffs of Moher to the Arctic Ocean, from Positano, Italy, to the Tasman Sea and from the Norwegian Sea at Vesterålen to the Black Sea at Ozuluce in Turkey. The black-and-white pictures are all exactly the same size, bifurcated exactly in half by the horizon line. The systematic nature of Sugimoto&#x27;s project recalls the work &quot;Sunrise and Sunset at Praiano&quot; by Sol LeWitt, in which he photographed sunrises and sunsets over the Tyrrhenian Sea off Praiano, Italy, on the Amalfi Coast.

===Architecture works===
In 1995, Sugimoto photographed the Sanjūsangen-dō (&quot;Hall of Thirty-Three Bays&quot;) in Kyoto. In special preparation for the shoot, he had all late-medieval and early-modern embellishments removed, as well as having the contemporary fluorescent lighting turned off. Shot from a high vantage point and editing out all architectural features, the resulting 48 photographs concentrate on the bodhisattvas, 1,000 life-size and almost identical gilded figures carved from wood in the 12th and 13th centuries, that are banked up inside the building.

In 1997, on a commission from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Sugimoto began producing series of large-format photographs of notable buildings around the world. In 2003, the museum showed the series in a sepulchral installation, with the pictures installed on layered rows of dark-painted partitions. Sugimoto&#x27;s later &quot;Architecture&quot; series (2000–03) consists of blurred images of well-known examples of Modernist architecture.

In 2001, Sugimoto traveled the length of Japan, visiting the so-called meisho &quot;famous sites&quot; for pines: Miho no Matsubara, Matsushima, Amanohashidate. On the royal palace grounds in Tokyo, Sugimoto photographed a pine landscape, copying a traditional 16th-century Japanese ink-painting style. Listed as Japanese national treasures, the &quot;Shōrin-zu byōbu&quot; (&quot;Pine Forest Screens&quot;) (ca. 1590) by Momoyama period (1568 1600) painter Hasegawa Tōhaku (1539–1610) represent a coming of age in Japanese imaging.

===&quot;Joe&quot;===
In July 2003 Sugimoto travelled to St. Louis to photograph the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, designed by Tadao Ando whose work he had portrayed various times before. However, his ended up photographing Richard Serra&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Joe&quot; (the first in his &quot;Torqued Spiral&quot; series), which rests in an outdoor courtyard, at dawn and at dusk for five days. The resulting &quot;Joe&quot; series was made with short exposure. The blurring effect results from Sugimoto&#x27;s unconventional use of the flexibility of the large format camera, whereby he sets the distance between the lens and the film to half the focal length, in his words &quot;twice-infinity&quot;. Sugimoto gave the photographs serial numbers from his &quot;Architecture&quot; series. Significantly, the hand-developed gelatin-silver photographs are mounted on aluminum panels but are otherwise unframed, unglazed and unlaminated to draw attention to what Sugimoto describes as the &quot;transformation from the three-dimensional steel source sculpture to the thin layers of what I would call my &#x27;silver sculpture&#x27;.&quot; When the Pulitzer Arts Foundation decided to publish a book about the series, Sugimoto asked Jonathan Safran Foer, whom he had met years earlier, to write a text to accompany the nineteen selected photographs.

A 2004 series comprises large photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, which Sugimoto came across in Tokyo and shot from slightly below. The Mathematical forms – stereometric models in plaster – were created in the 19th century to provide students with a visual understanding of complex trigonometric functions. The Mechanical forms – machine models including gears, pumps and regulators – are industrial tools used to demonstrate basic movements of modern machinery. Sugimoto began working on this series as a response to &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)&quot; by Marcel Duchamp.

For the series &quot;Stylized Sculpture&quot; (2007), Sugimoto selected distinctive garments by celebrated couturiers from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute, shot in chiaroscuro on headless mannequins—from Madeleine Vionnet&#x27;s precociously modern T-dress and Balenciaga&#x27;s wasp-waisted billowing ensemble to Yves St Laurent&#x27;s strict geometric Mondrian shift and Issey Miyake&#x27;s sail-like slip.

For his 2009 series &quot;Lightning Fields&quot; Sugimoto abandoned the use of the camera, producing photographs using a
400,000 volt Van de Graaff generator to apply an electrical charge directly onto the film. Instead of placing an object on photo-sensitive paper, then exposing it to light, he produced the image by causing electrical sparks to erupt over the on surface of a 7-by-2.5-foot sheet of film laid on a large metal tabletop. The highly detailed results combine bristling textures and branching sparks into highly evocative images.

===Recent work===
In 2009 U2 selected Sugimoto&#x27;s &quot;Boden Sea, Uttwil&quot; (1993) as the cover for their album &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot; to be released in March that year. This image had previously been used by sound artists Richard Chartier and Taylor Deupree for their 2006 CD inspired by Sugimoto&#x27;s &quot;seascapes&quot; series. Sugimoto noted it was merely a &quot;coincidence&quot; that the image appears on both album covers. In addition, he notes that the agreement with U2 was a &quot;stone age deal&quot; or, artist-to-artist. No cash exchanged hands, rather a barter agreement which allows Sugimoto to use the band&#x27;s song &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot; (partly inspired by the &quot;Boden Sea&quot; image) in any future project.

In 2009, Sugimoto acquired some rare negatives made by Henry Fox Talbot in the 1840s and retrieved through an intensely fragile process what &quot;looks remarkably like Plato&#x27;s shadows in the cave&quot;. The works of Sugimoto&#x27;s &quot;All Five Elements&quot; series (2011) consist of optical quality glass with black and white film. On the occasion of Art Basel in 2012, Sugimoto presented &quot;Couleurs de l&#x27;Ombre&quot;, 20 different colorful scarf designs in editions of just seven, all created – using a new inkjet printing method – for French fashion label Hermès.

==Architecture==
Sugimoto is also an accomplished architect. He founded his architecture practice in Tokyo after receiving requests to design structures from restaurants to art museums. Because he does not have an architectural license himself—an official permit would require years of training—he hired three young qualified architects to help him execute his vision. He approaches all of his work from many different perspectives, and architecture is one component that he uses to design the settings for his exhibitions. His recent projects include an architectural commission at Naoshima Contemporary Art Center in Japan, for which Sugimoto designed and built a Shinto shrine. He also gets involved with the performance art occurring beside them. This allows him to frame his works precisely the way he wants to.

In 2013, Sugimoto created a sculpture and rock garden for the Sasha Kanetanaka restaurant in Omotesandō, Tokyo. He also designed Stove, a top-tier French restaurant housed in a refurbished wooden house in the Kiyoharu Art Village, Yamanashi Prefecture. The first in a series of temporary artist-designed structures at the Le Stanze del Vetro museum on view during the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2014, a Sugimoto-designed glass teahouse was set over a tiled pool and had the traditional tea ceremony performed for the public in it.

In 2011, Sugimoto published an architecture book about the many museums that have shown his work, from the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., to the Fondation Cartier in Paris.

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden announced that in 2018 Sugimoto would transform the interior of the Gordon Bunshaft-designed building. The plans included a coffee bar and removal of the tint on the windows.

==Sculpture==
Sugimoto designed &quot;Point of Infinity&quot;, a nearly 70 ft-high stainless steel needle that also acts as a sundial, on top of the Yerba Buena Hilltop Park on Yerba Buena Island.

==Exhibitions==
Sugimoto has exhibited extensively in major museums and galleries throughout the world, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (1994), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1995); Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin (2000); the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria (2002); the Serpentine Gallery, London (2003) and the Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;Art Contemporain, Paris (2004). A major 30-year survey of his work opened at the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo in 2005 and travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas (2006). In 2007, a European retrospective began at K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf (2007) and traveled to the Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin and Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland. (2008). In 2011, Gagosian Gallery in Paris showed Sugimoto&#x27;s series &quot;Stylized Sculpture&quot; alongside Rodin&#x27;s sculptures &quot;The Three Shades&quot; (c. 1880), &quot;Monument to Victor Hugo&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Whistler Muse&quot; (1908).

In 2005, Japan Society, New York, and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Washington, organized a US and Canadian tour of &quot;Hiroshi Sugimoto: History of History&quot;, an exhibition of artifacts that Sugimoto has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan, curated by the artist himself (travelled to the Kanazawa 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and the National Museum of Art, Japan). In 2013, Sugimoto exhibited his artwork alongside pieces from his personal collection at the Fondation Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent in Paris.

His exhibition, &quot;Lost Human Genetic Archive&quot;, at the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum in 2016, incorporated selected images from Dioramas, Seascapes, Theaters and the Sanjūsangen-dō series, among others. His exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2018 featured 34 large-scale photographs from Sugimoto&#x27;s central series. A retrospective of his work is currently showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2024).

==Collections==
Sugimoto&#x27;s work is held in numerous public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery, London; National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo; Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; MACBA, Barcelona; and Tate Gallery, London.

==Odawara Art Foundation==
In 2009, Sugimoto established the Odawara Art Foundation to promote Japanese culture. In 2014, the Japan Society awarded a $6 million grant to the foundation. The money will go to the construction of a multidisciplinary arts complex in Odawara, about 60 miles west of Tokyo. The project is expected to be completed in spring 2016. The project includes an original 15th-century entrance gate, a minimalist exhibition space, a modern Japanese teahouse, and a contemporary Noh theater with a stage that appears to float above the sea. The foundation will produce joint productions with the Japan Society as well as artist-in-residency programs at the new complex. The two institutions will also collaborate on exhibitions and performances.

<text>André H.P. Cools (; 1 August 1927 – 18 July 1991) was a Belgian politician and a senior figure within the Walloon Socialist Party (PS) in the Liège region. He was assassinated in 1991 and the subsequent investigation uncovered widespread graft within Belgium&#x27;s two socialist parties.

==Political career==
Cools had a long and distinguished political career. He was the Belgian budget minister from 1968 to 1971, Deputy Prime Minister from 1969 to 1972, head of the Walloon section of the Belgian Parti Socialiste (PS) from 1973 to 1978, chairman of the national party from 1978 to 1981, president of the Walloon Council from 1982 to 1985, and minister of the government of the Walloon Region from 1988 to 1990. He was also given the honorific title of Minister of State in 1983. In 1990 he retired from the national political scene after an internal power struggle within the PS but he remained influential in the local party in Liège.

Cools was noted for his pithy pronouncements. For example, when in 1984 he commented on who he thought the four greatest United States presidents had been, he said: &#x27;Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Roosevelt&#x27;.

His nickname was &quot;Le maître de Flémalle&quot; (&quot;Master of Flémalle&quot;). Cools had been mayor of from 1964 to 1977 and after the merger with Flémalle from 1977 until his death.

==Death==
Cools was shot and killed in Liège on July 18, 1991. He was 63 years old.

While the police were investigating the assassination, several scandals involving André Cools became public (like the Agusta-affair).

==Aftermath==
In 2003, a Liège trial started, accusing Richard Taxquet (former personal chauffeur and secretary for , a Parti Socialiste minister), Giuseppe &quot;Pino&quot; di Mauro, and others of involvement in the Cools murder. In January 2004, Taxquet and di Mauro were sentenced to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment.

<text>Notre Dame is a census-designated place and unincorporated community north of the city of South Bend in St. Joseph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. It includes the campuses of three colleges: the University of Notre Dame, Saint Mary&#x27;s College, and Holy Cross College. Notre Dame is split between Clay and Portage townships. As of the 2020 census, its population was 7,234.

==Demographics==

==Holy Cross religious communities==
Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame is a retirement community offering continuing care. It is owned by the Brothers of Holy Cross and managed by the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago Service Corporation.

Notre Dame is the home of three major headquarters of Holy Cross religious communities. On the campus of Saint Mary&#x27;s College, the Sisters of the Holy Cross have their Congregational Administration. The Holy Cross College campus is the location of the Provincial Offices of two provinces of the Congregation of Holy Cross: the Midwest Province of Brothers and the United States Province of Priests and Brothers. In addition to these, Notre Dame also holds provinces of the Superior Faith, which are the Eastern Province of Sisters and the Notre Dame Province of Holy Cross.

==Government and infrastructure==
As unincorporated communities do not have a municipal government, Notre Dame&#x27;s government entities are the United States post office and the colleges&#x27; police forces. All colleges and universities in Indiana are entitled to an independent police force by law. The University of Notre Dame also has its own fire department and supplies its own water and power utilities, except University Village and Cripe Street Apartments, Notre Dame&#x27;s family and married housing get their electricity from American Electric Power.

The United States Postal Service Notre Dame Post Office is located in the northwest corner of Hammes Mowbray Hall, west of East Gate along Juniper Road on the University of Notre Dame campus. It has been in operation since 1851.

==Education==
Notre Dame is in the South Bend Community School Corporation (SBCSC). The school zonings are as follows: Darden Elementary School Edison Middle School and Clay High School (for Landings at Notre Dame). Previously, Darden Primary, Tarkington Traditional Elementary, Clay Intermediate, and Clay High served as the local public schools for children of graduate students at University Village. At the end of the 2017–2018 school year, Fischer Graduate Residence became the designated housing for students with dependent children, as University Village closed.

<text>M-6, or the Paul B. Henry Freeway, is a east–west freeway and state trunkline highway in the United States that serves portions of southern Kent and eastern Ottawa counties south of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Although the freeway is named for Paul B. Henry, local residents and the press continue to use the original name, South Beltline as well on occasion. The freeway connects Interstate 196 (I-196) on the west with I-96 on the east. M-6 also provides a connection to U.S. Highway 131 (US 131) in the middle of its corridor while running through several townships on the south side of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan. Each end is in a rural area while the central section has suburban development along the trunkline.

The freeway was originally conceived in the 1960s. It took 32 years to approve, plan, finance, and build the freeway from the time that the state first authorized funding in 1972 to the time of the ribbon-cutting ceremony in 2004 that opened the South Beltline to traffic. The project cost around $700 million or around $35 million per mile (approximately $22 million per kilometer). Initial construction started in November 1997, with the first phase opened in November 2001. The full freeway was opened in November 2004. The first phase of construction was completed in asphalt, while the second and third phases were built in concrete. The project was built with two firsts: the first single-point urban interchange (SPUI; ) in Michigan, and a new technique to apply the pavement markings, embedding them into the concrete to reduce the chance of a snowplow scraping them off. In advance of the opening of the freeway to traffic, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) allowed the public to walk or bike the South Beltline in an open-house event called the &quot;Southbelt Shuffle&quot;.

== Route description ==

M-6 starts at exit 64 on I-196 in Ottawa County near Hudsonville. The freeway runs southeast from the interchange through the rural Georgetown and Jamestown townships toward the county line. Through this area, MDOT traffic surveys measured a traffic count of 27,117 vehicles on average per day, the lowest along the freeway, in 2010. At Kenowa Avenue, the South Beltline crosses into Byron Township in Kent County. The freeway corridor is bounded on each side by farmland, scattered subdivisions, and small pockets of woodland. Near the Wilson Avenue interchange, M-6 curves to the northeast around the edge of the Ironwood Golf Course and heads for the interchange with Byron Center Avenue. On either side of the freeway at Byron Center Avenue, there are two hospitals, Metro Health and St. Mary&#x27;s Southwest, the former located on the very southern edge of the city of Wyoming. Continuing east, the beltline curves to the southeast and into the cloverleaf interchange complex at US 131. This &quot;mammoth&quot; interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8 km) in one direction and over a mile (1.6 km) in the other, encompassing 27 bridges and 18 retaining walls. This makes it the largest freeway interchange in Western Michigan. There are four overpasses which carry M-6 over the US 131 freeway: two for the main carriageways in each direction and two for the collector-distributor lanes on each side. The auxiliary lanes funnel the traffic using the interchange off the main carriageways to eliminate conflicts between merging streams of traffic. In the eastbound direction, the collector-distributor lane also has access to a ramp for traffic bound for 68th Street, which runs parallel to, and south of, the M-6 freeway. No such access to 68th Street is provided for westbound M-6 traffic, although 68th Street traffic can access each direction of M-6 or US 131.
East of US 131, M-6 crosses over Division Avenue and enters Gaines Township through a series of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes. This area had the highest traffic counts in 2011 at 55,236 vehicles per day. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, the freeway passes through an area with retail businesses and movie theaters on each side of the interchange; to the northeast is East Kentwood High School. On the approach to the East Paris Avenue underpass, M-6 curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast, passing near one of Steelcase&#x27;s office buildings, the pyramid-shaped Corporate Development Center. The freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into Caledonia Township, with an interchange for M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and an overpass for 60th Street. M-6 curves around the southeast side of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Cascade Township. As the South Beltline nears I-96, it crosses 48th Street next to the Thornapple Pointe Golf Course. The carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of I-96, the ramps to eastbound I-96 crossing over the Thornapple River in the process. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Paul B. Henry South Beltline Freeway. The entire length of the freeway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense and mobility.

The right-of-way along M-6 includes a pedestrian path known as the Frederik Meijer Trail. Previously called the M-6 Trail, it links the Kent Trails west of Byron Center Avenue in Wyoming with the Paul Henry Rail Trail at 60th Street and Wing Avenue by Paris Park in Kentwood.

== History ==

=== Earlier designations ===

The first appearance of M-6 was in 1926 as a road in Keweenaw County in the Upper Peninsula. The highway ran from US 41 at Phoenix to north of Eagle River. The Michigan State Highway Department redesignated the highway as M-111 in 1938, and it was redesignated two years later to become a part of the route of M-26.

In the late 1970s, during the second phase of construction of the I-696 (Walter P. Reuther Freeway) in Metro Detroit, lobbying efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section. If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned M-6 to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11 Mile Road to connect the already built stack interchange at I-75 east to I-94. By the time the eastern freeway segment was completed in 1979, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage, leaving an gap in the I-696 freeway until completion of the central section in 1989.

==== Planning ====
The South Beltline Freeway near Grand Rapids was a project that took about 32 years to complete. The idea dates back to the 1940s, but serious proposals were not made until the 1960s. The 1955 planning map for the Grand Rapids area Interstate Highways included a freeway roughly along the M-6 corridor before I-96 and I-196 were shifted north and east to their current locations. An increase in the state gas tax was approved in 1972 with the goal to finance local road projects in the state, including the South Beltline. The project was anticipated to cost $30–100 million (equivalent to $– million in ) in June 1975 with an expected groundbreaking in 1982–85. The highway was studied in January 1981 for $144,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The choice of consultants on the project was controversial; local planners felt that MDOT picked BKI Inc. only because they used a minority-owned subcontractor and not because they would be qualified for the assignment.

As this study was initiated, the route for the proposed freeway was located between 60th and 68th streets with a western end in Hudsonville and an eastern end in Lowell Township. The consultants were asked to study a full freeway and a limited access boulevard design. One final option was a &quot;no-build&quot; alternative; under this option, existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built. The City of Grand Rapids opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it. City officials were concerned about the impact to commercial and industrial business in Grand Rapids. Hudsonville&#x27;s city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to Detroit or Cleveland. Other supporters, such as the Georgetown Township supervisor, were concerned that delays in starting the project could increase costs. State and local officials expected the freeway in January 1981 to cost between $40–100 million (equivalent to $– million in ). The road was to be started no sooner than 1990.
The boundaries for the highway corridor were determined by the consultants in April 1982, running between 60th and 84th streets, &quot;dipping like a hammock beneath the cities of Kentwood and Wyoming&quot;. The results of the study by BKI were criticized by local planners in May 1982, who called the study &quot;shabby and unprofessional work&quot;, and asked the state to fire the consulting firm. Local residents distributed 2,000 fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway. The South Belt Local Advisory Board criticized BKI&#x27;s 110-page study report as &quot;filled with errors&quot;; the consultants&#x27; earlier 26-page paper had been rejected by the board and MDOT as &quot;unusable&quot;. An editorial in &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; stated that the study did not help advance the project in the area, instead opening the proposed freeway up to new controversies. Doubts about the state&#x27;s budget in 1982 to build the roadway combined with issues over the consultants and their study results.

A second citizens group, the South Belt Citizens Committee, was formed in July 1982 to gain additional public information on the project and supplement the work of the other groups, including the South Belt Local Advisory Board. BKI was fired as consultant on the project by MDOT on September 9, 1982. The switch to a new consultant delayed further study because of the timetable to take bids and interview the candidates. In the interim, work was shifted to local and state planners until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the delays involved. These local projects were focused on updating the information and maps from BKI&#x27;s study and refining the scope of the highway&#x27;s corridor.

Gaines, Cascade, and Caledonia townships and the city of Kentwood circulated a survey amongst their communities&#x27; planning commissions and elected boards in 1982. The survey showed an inconclusive preference for a limited-access highway in what was termed a &quot;gut level reaction&quot; to the proposed roadway. The South Belt Citizens Committee actively started to oppose the roadway during the fall of 1982, pressing local candidates for political office to take positions on the project. The group called the roadway a &quot;holocaust&quot; in its mailings to the candidates. Future Lieutenant Governor Dick Posthumus, then a member of the Michigan State Senate, called for an end to the studies in 1983; he would later reverse and become one of the project&#x27;s biggest supporters.

MDOT hired a new consultant, Schimpeler/Coradino Associates, in 1984 to study the proposed freeway. The consultant recommended the freeway in March 1985. The South Beltline was included in the ten-year highway plan in 1986. By 1989, the state wanted to set the route in 1991 with construction starting in 1993. The freeway was studied as a possible toll road in June 1991 after three alternative routes were proposed the previous year. That September, the final route was set with a projected start date in 1997. The toll road concept was revived in September 1995 to offset the failure of a proposed gas tax increase. As a cost-saving measure, the number of interchanges was reduced to four from eight in June 1996. When a gas tax increase was passed in 1997, Governor John Engler promised at least seven access points for the freeway. The South Beltline was touted as &quot;[cutting] travel time around Grand Rapids virtually in half&quot;.

==== Phase I ====

Proposals for the South Beltline Freeway were nearly 25 years old by the time initial construction was started in 1997. The Michigan State Legislature named the South Beltline around the same time for the Congressman Paul B. Henry, who died in office in 1993, serving in Gerald Ford&#x27;s old US House seat. The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re-election against Geoffrey Fieger in 1998. The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008, with the first phase opening in 2002. MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map, marking M-6 for the first time as a dotted line, to denote it was &quot;under construction&quot;. The legislature approved Engler&#x27;s &quot;Build Michigan III&quot; program in 2000; the plan accelerated road projects in the state. The capital outlay for the year was $82 million (equivalent to $ in ). Condemnation proceedings were initiated in the Kent County Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions. Land that contained homes, farms, trailer parks, and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right-of-way needed for the freeway. The land needed measured wide and long. Land acquisitions for the South Beltline Freeway were completed in July 2001. Construction started later in the fall of 2001 on the second and third phases of the project.

The first leg of the South Beltline Freeway, located between M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and I-96, was finished six months early. Dry summer weather allowed the roadbed contractors to finish their portion of the section of the freeway early, earning them a $300,000 bonus (equivalent to $ in ). The overpasses for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction, leaving the interchanges at US 131 and I-196 and the connecting roadbed to be completed at that time. The first section was paved in asphalt after MDOT reversed the decision to pave the whole freeway in concrete. That stretch of freeway opened to traffic on November 20, 2001. The state kept the overall project in an accelerated status headed into the next phases in 2002.

==== Phases II and III ====

Construction of the remaining phases between US 131 and M-37 and between I-196 and US 131 was started on April 1, 2002. Area roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with posted detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway. The last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound I-196 to eastbound M-6. Design flaws were found in 2002 in the size of the beams in the bridges over eastbound I-196 and the ramp from westbound M-6 to westbound I-196. The replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along I-196 over a weekend in 2004, but kept a lane closed for a full week, backing up traffic on the Interstate for ; completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts.
MDOT hosted an open house along the unopened section of M-6 between Kalamazoo and Byron Center avenues. This event took place on October 2, 2004, and was billed as the &quot;Southbelt Shuffle&quot;, allowing the public to walk or bike along the freeway. The event was planned to draw attention to the M-6 Trail that runs parallel to the freeway. Some event participants brought their horses for the chance to ride on the freeway. The whole freeway was opened to traffic on November 17, 2004, after a ribbon cutting ceremony. When opened, reconstruction work was still being completed on overpass bridges at the I-196 interchange on the west end. The entire project cost $700 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete over the five-year construction period, about $35 million/mi (approximately $22 million/km, equivalent to $/mi or $/km in ). When the freeway was opened, it was the first in the state of Michigan to use a SPUI located at the Kalamazoo Avenue exit. All of the bridges and sound barrier walls were painted sienna beige as part of a &quot;color theme&quot; to the freeway. MDOT also used a new technique to recess the pavement markings into the concrete, designed to reduce the likelihood that snowplows would scrape them off. The signs are in miles, but &quot;the entire M-6 freeway was designed and constructed in metric&quot;, according to MDOT manager Suzette Peplinski. The final ramps opened to traffic on December 9, 2004.

==== After construction ====

MDOT added the completed M-6 to the state maps in an updated printing in June 2005. At the time, the various online mapping services still did not show a complete freeway in eastern Ottawa or southern Kent counties. Services such as Mapquest and Yahoo! Maps rely on Tele Atlas out of New Hampshire for their mapping information, which, in turn, relies on agencies like MDOT to update their data. MDOT&#x27;s map update came out nearly eight months after the initial opening due to its inclusion in a large-scale update to the state highway map.

A year after the freeway opened, traffic volumes along parallel roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 as a result of development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.

Reactions to the new freeway were not all positive. In a special editorial in &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.

The M-6 Trail was constructed in a $3.5 million project (equivalent to $ in ) that started in 2008. The goal was to create a path linking the Kent Trails with the Paul Henry Rail Trail. The M-6 Trail was the brainchild of Gaines Township Supervisor Don Hilton Sr. He had pushed to have the path included in the original freeway construction and opened with the rest of the South Beltline. The trail project was funded by $2.9 million (equivalent to $ in ) in federal grants and $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from the Frederik and Lena Meijer Foundation. The balance came from Kent County and the townships. Work on the trail was completed in November 2008.

In 2009, the asphalt section of M-6 had to be repaired. This section of roadway between East Paris Avenue and 48th Street was rated poorly by the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, while the concrete west of Broadmoor Avenue had favorable marks. MDOT budgeted $2 million in repairs on top of previous crack-related fixes that were handled by the original pavement contractor under a warranty in 2006. The local press described the stretch of road as &quot;troublesome&quot; in relation to pavement quality issues.

Legislation was signed by Governor Rick Snyder on December 27, 2014, to name the section of M-6 between Byron Center and Kalamazoo avenues the David John Warsen Memorial Highway. Warsen, a US Navy SEAL, was killed in a helicopter accident in Afghanistan in 2012. This section of the highway was dedicated on August 15, 2015.

<doc id="1006151" wikidata="Q6423129" url="?curid=1006151" title="Knotty Ash">
<text>Knotty Ash is an area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and a Liverpool City Council Ward. Historically in Lancashire, the population at the 2001 Census was 13,200, increasing to 13,312 at the 2011 Census. Knotty Ash is well known as the home of comedian Sir Ken Dodd, who often mentioned it in his act.

==Description==
Knotty Ash is a small area on the eastern fringe of Liverpool and neighbours the West Derby, Old Swan, Broadgreen, Dovecot and Huyton districts. Its name is derived from a gnarled ash tree which formerly stood near the present-day Knotty Ash public house. In 2004, comedian and local resident Ken Dodd planted a new ash tree close to the site of the original.

==Governance==

Knotty Ash is represented on Liverpool City Council by three councillors, and is wholly within the Liverpool West Derby constituency. The current MP is Ian Byrne (Labour), who has represented the seat since 2019.

==Education==
Knotty Ash has the special needs secondary school Clifford Holroyde and a primary school, Knotty Ash CP.

==Transport==
Knotty Ash has an extensive bus network which, in the main, uses the Prescot Road corridor. Services 7, 8/9, 10/10A/10B, 15 and 204 link Knotty Ash to Liverpool City Centre, and these services provide links to Dingle, Toxteth, Edge Hill, Kensington, Tuebrook, Wavertree, Old Swan, Stoneycroft, Broadgreen Hospital, Belle Vale, Page Moss and Huyton, with some of these services going further afield to Prescot, Whiston, Cronton, Thatto Heath, St Helens, Penketh and Warrington.

There are also services like the 61 (Bootle - Aigburth) and 102 (Page Moss/Broadgreen Hospital - Fazakerley Hospital) which do not service the city centre, but provide links to various areas of North and South Liverpool, Knowsley and Sefton. In addition, there are various industrial and school bus services which pass through Knotty Ash.

Knotty Ash railway station on the North Liverpool Extension Line formerly served the area, but this closed to passenger traffic in 1960. The former trackway is now part of National Cycle Network Route 62. The nearest current National Rail station is Broad Green, approximately a mile away from Knotty Ash, where fairly regular trains go to/from Liverpool Lime Street, and generally continue on to Wigan North Western, Manchester Victoria and Warrington Bank Quay stations.

Knotty Ash is also approximately a mile away from the western terminus of the M62 motorway, Rocket Roundabout in Broadgreen.

==Sport==
Between 1951 and 1968, the district was home to the city&#x27;s rugby league team Liverpool City who played at their Knotty Ash Stadium, Mill Yard. Their playing strip consisted of white jerseys with a broad green hoop and white shorts. After the 1967–68 season, they left the district and moved to nearby Huyton, changing the club&#x27;s name to Huyton RLFC. Having no home venue for the 1968–69 season, their new Huyton home ground of Alt Park was opened for the following 1969–70 season.

==In popular culture==
In the 1960s, Knotty Ash was made famous in the United Kingdom by stand-up comedian and lifelong resident Ken Dodd, as the home of the dwarfish comic characters he called the Diddy Men. In his BBC children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Ken Dodd and the Diddymen&quot; (1969), the fictitious Diddyland, boasting the highest sunshine rate in the world, was situated in the centre of Knotty Ash. The Diddy Men worked in the local &quot;Jam Butty Mines&quot;.

Knotty Ash was reportedly the site of the unsolved &quot;Tiki&quot; Murder in 1961, in which a housewife was killed in what was claimed to be a ritual linked to the worship of the Polynesian idol Tiki.

<doc id="1006159" wikidata="Q7655050" url="?curid=1006159" title="Swedish telephone plugs &amp; sockets">
<text>A standard Swedish telephone plug carries one telephone line and has four flat metal pins and one plastic pin. The design is used only by Televerket (now Telia Company) in Sweden and older Póstur og Sími (now Síminn) installations in Iceland (RJ11 and a data/voice standard using an 8P8C modular connector are used in more recent buildings). Neither plug nor socket is compatible with other plugs and sockets. It is defined in Swedish Standard SS 455 15 50.

==Sockets connected in cascade==
When there is only one socket in a house or apartment, the incoming line is connected to the two lower receptacles and the upper receptacles are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one telephone socket, they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper receptacles of a socket to the lower receptacles of the next socket. When a connected telephone&#x27;s handset is lifted, the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.

The plastic pin adds a presence function. When not inserted into a jack, the jack itself (mechanically) connects the incoming line to the next socket.

The cascade topology makes installing a DSL splitter a matter of plugging it in the first socket since this socket provides both direct access to the PSTN and connections to the remaining sockets.

==Sockets connected in parallel==
When all sockets on a line are connected in parallel only the lower pins on a Swedish Standard plug (middle connectors on RJ-plugs) are used. This configuration was earlier not allowed due to Swedish law prohibiting the possibility of eavesdropping on a telephone line (and possibly also to limit each household&#x27;s load on the exchange). Parallel connection of sockets is now allowed but can be considered bad practice by some, and makes DSL splitter installation more cumbersome. The advantages include compatibility with foreign equipment and conference call-type communication.

==Other connectors used in Sweden==
In addition to the standard Swedish plugs and sockets, RJ11 connectors are quite common, especially in offices. Even 8P8C modular telephone sockets can be found. Most telephone equipment sold in Sweden today has RJ11 sockets and corresponding cables with 6P4C plugs on each end and an adaptor from RJ11 to SS 455 15 50 sockets. The Swedish practice with sockets connected in cascade can be maintained with RJ plugs and sockets by using the first pair for connecting the terminal equipment to the PSTN and the second pair for the connection of a line towards the next socket. However, the presence function found in Swedish Standard sockets is lost, so disconnecting a telephone from its socket requires replacing it with a dummy plug so the sockets further down in the chain will remain connected.

6P6C modular plugs are also used for telephony, but only for certain telephone exchange systems - never for direct connection to the PSTN. ISDN telephones and outlets always have 8P8C modular connectors.

<doc id="1006162" wikidata="Q468722" url="?curid=1006162" title="Yu Jin">
<text>Yu Jin (died September 221), courtesy name Wenze, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He joined Cao Cao in 192 around the start of the civil wars leading to the collapse of the dynasty, and fought in many of the campaigns which established the warlord&#x27;s position as a central figure in that period. In 219, Yu Jin was tasked with leading forces to relieve Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren, who was being besieged in Fancheng by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, but his armies were destroyed in a flood due to heavy rains. Yu Jin surrendered to Guan Yu and became a prisoner-of-war, but was transferred to the custody of another warlord, Sun Quan, after Sun Quan&#x27;s forces captured Guan Yu&#x27;s bases in late 219. Sun Quan treated Yu Jin like a guest and in 221 sent him back to the state of Cao Wei, which was founded in late 220 by Cao Cao&#x27;s successor, Cao Pi, who ended the Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Pi pardoned Yu Jin and restored him to the position of a general. However, Yu Jin died later that year in regret after visiting Cao Cao&#x27;s tomb, where he saw illustrations of the Battle of Fancheng depicting his surrender to Guan Yu.

Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, named Yu Jin as one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Zhang He, Yue Jin, Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.

==Early career==
Yu Jin was born in Juping County (), Taishan Commandery (), which is in present-day Tai&#x27;an, Shandong, in the late Eastern Han dynasty. In the early 180s, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, Yu Jin responded to the Han government&#x27;s call for volunteers to serve in the imperial army and help to suppress the revolt. He became a subordinate of the general Bao Xin, who was based in Yan Province (covering present-day southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan).

In 192, after the warlord Cao Cao took charge of Yan Province, Yu Jin and his fellow volunteers were appointed as &quot;doubo&quot;s (都伯; an officer leading 100 men) and placed under the command of Wang Lang. Wang Lang felt that Yu Jin was extraordinary and had the potential to become a great general, so he recommended Yu Jin to Cao Cao. Cao Cao commissioned Yu Jin as a Major () after interviewing him, and then sent him to attack Guangwei (), a location in Xu Province, which was governed by Tao Qian. Yu Jin successfully conquered Guangwei and was promoted to Commandant Who Breaks Formations ().

==Battles against Lü Bu, Yellow Turban remnants and Yuan Shu==
Between 194 and 195, Yu Jin fought on Cao Cao&#x27;s side in a war against a rival warlord Lü Bu for control over Yan Province. He destroyed two of Lü Bu&#x27;s camps at the south of the city during a battle in Puyang while his subordinates defeated Gao Ya (), one of Lü Bu&#x27;s officers, at Xuchang (須昌; northeast of present-day Dongping County, Shandong).

Yu Jin later attacked Lü Bu&#x27;s strongholds at Shouzhang (壽張; southwest of present-day Dongping County, Shandong), Dingtao (定陶; present-day Dingtao County, Shandong) and Lihu (離狐; southeast of present-day Puyang, Henan) counties, and captured all of them. He also besieged Zhang Chao at Yongqiu (雍丘; present-day Qi County, Henan) and conquered the county.

Around 196, Yu Jin joined Cao Cao in a campaign against remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels led by Liu Pi (), Huang Shao () and others. They garrisoned at Banliang (). One night, Huang Shao and the rebels attempted to launch a surprise attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s camp, but were defeated by Yu Jin and his subordinates. Liu Pi, Huang Shao and the rebel leaders were killed and the remaining rebels surrendered. Yu Jin was promoted to Colonel Who Pacifies the Barbarians ().

In 197, Yu Jin besieged Qiao Rui (), an officer serving under a rival warlord Yuan Shu, at Ku County (苦縣; present-day Luyi County, Henan) and killed Qiao Rui and four other enemy officers.

==Battles against Zhang Xiu, Lü Bu and Sui Gu==
In 197, Yu Jin accompanied Cao Cao on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Xiu in Wancheng (宛城; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Zhang Xiu initially surrendered and pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, but rebelled later and defeated Cao Cao in a surprise attack. There was chaos and disorder in Cao Cao&#x27;s forces as they retreated to Wuyin County (舞陰縣; southeast of present-day Sheqi County, Henan).

Only Yu Jin led his unit to continue fighting the pursuing enemy while maintaining an orderly retreat to Wuyin County. They managed to stay together even though they had sustained many casualties and losses. When Zhang Xiu&#x27;s forces slowed down on their pursuit, Yu Jin reorganised his men and led them towards Wuyin County in a dignified manner even though they had lost the battle.

Before reaching Cao Cao&#x27;s position, Yu Jin encountered about a dozen injured and naked men on the road. When he asked them what happened, they told him that they were robbed by the Qingzhou Corps (). Yu Jin turned furious and said: &quot;The Qingzhou Corps are part of Lord Cao&#x27;s army. How dare they become robbers!&quot; He then led his men to attack and punish them. Some of the Qingzhou soldiers escaped to Wuyin County and accused Yu Jin of committing the crimes they were responsible for.

When Yu Jin reached Wuyin County, he immediately set up defensive fortifications around the camp instead of reporting directly to Cao Cao. His subordinates told him: &quot;The Qingzhou soldiers framed you. You should explain matters to Lord Cao as soon as possible.&quot; Yu Jin replied: &quot;The enemy is still in pursuit and may reach here anytime. If we don&#x27;t set up defences now, how can we expect to hold them off? Lord Cao is intelligent and wise. Those accusations aren&#x27;t a cause for concern.&quot;

After the defences were set up, Yu Jin went to meet Cao Cao and explained everything. Cao Cao felt pleased and he said, &quot;How dangerous it was for me when we were defeated at the Yu River. General, you&#x27;re able to bring order to chaos and hold your ground against a fierce enemy, and you display unwavering loyalty. Even the famous generals of ancient times couldn&#x27;t have done better than you!&quot; Yu Jin was awarded the title &quot;Marquis of Yishou Village&quot; () in recognition of his contributions.

In 198, Yu Jin followed Cao Cao on another campaign against Zhang Xiu at Rang County (穰縣; or Rangcheng 穰城, in present-day Dengzhou, Henan). He also participated in the Battle of Xiapi against Lü Bu, which resulted in Lü Bu&#x27;s defeat and execution. Later, he joined Shi Huan () and Cao Ren in defeating Sui Gu () at Shequan County (射犬縣; present-day Qinyang, Henan).

==Guandu campaign==
In early 200, when war broke out between Cao Cao and his northern rival Yuan Shao, with the latter initially having the upper hand, Yu Jin volunteered to lead the vanguard to engage Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces. Cao Cao was impressed with Yu Jin&#x27;s courage, so he placed Yu Jin in command of 2,000 infantry and cavalry and ordered him to defend Yan Ford (延津; in present-day Yanjin County, Henan) from the enemy, while he personally led another army to Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan).

Around the time, the warlord Liu Bei seized control of Xu Province after killing Che Zhou (), the provincial governor whom Cao Cao had appointed. Cao Cao then led his forces to attack Liu Bei. Yuan Shao concurrently attacked Yan Ford, but Yu Jin managed to hold his position.

Later, Yu Jin and Yue Jin led 5,000 infantry and cavalry to attack Yuan Shao&#x27;s camps along the Yellow River southwest of Yan Ford. They travelled to as far as Ji (汲; southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan) and Huojia (獲嘉; southeast of present-day Huojia County, Henan) counties. They set fire to over 30 enemy camps, killed or captured thousands of enemy soldiers, and forced over 20 of Yuan Shao&#x27;s officers, including He Mao () and Wang Mo (), into surrendering. Cao Cao then ordered Yu Jin to garrison at Yuanwu County (原武縣; present-day Yuanyang County, Henan). Yu Jin attacked and destroyed Yuan Shao&#x27;s camp at Dushi Ford ().

Yu Jin was promoted to Major-General () for his achievement and was then relocated to Cao Cao&#x27;s camp at Guandu. During the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces piled up earth to form small hills and constructed platforms on top for their archers, who rained arrows on Cao Cao&#x27;s camp. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces sustained many casualties and the soldiers were all fearful. Yu Jin firmly defended his positions, fought bravely, and displayed great fervour. He was promoted to Lieutenant-General () after Cao Cao scored a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at Guandu.

==Suppressing two rebellions==
Cao Cao continued waging wars against Yuan Shao after the Battle of Guandu and against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and allies after Yuan Shao died in 202. By 206, after he had seized control of Ji Province (covering parts of present-day southern Hebei) from the Yuans, a minor warlord Chang Xi () who had initially surrendered to him in early 201 rebelled against him. Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to lead an army to attack Chang Xi. Chang Xi surrendered to Yu Jin, who was an old friend of his.

When his subordinates suggested that he send Chang Xi as a prisoner-of-war to Cao Cao and let Cao Cao decide Chang Xi&#x27;s fate, Yu Jin said: &quot;Aren&#x27;t you all aware of the norms established by Lord Cao? He doesn&#x27;t spare those who surrender after they are surrounded. I should follow his norms and uphold law and order. Chang Xi may be an old friend of mine, but I won&#x27;t break the norms because of this!&quot; He personally supervised Chang Xi&#x27;s execution and shed tears as he gave the order.

When Cao Cao heard about it, he remarked: &quot;Is it Heaven&#x27;s will that Chang Xi had his fate decided by Yu Jin instead of me?&quot; He regarded Yu Jin more highly than before after this incident. Yu Jin was promoted to General of Tiger&#x27;s Might () for his efforts in pacifying Chang Xi&#x27;s revolt.

In 209, after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Chen Lan () and Mei Cheng () started a rebellion in Lu County (六縣; present-day Lu&#x27;an, Anhui). Cao Cao sent two separate forces to suppress the rebellion: Yu Jin and Zang Ba to attack Mei Cheng; Zhang Liao, with Zhang He and Niu Gai () as his deputies, to attack Chen Lan. Mei Cheng and his followers, who numbered about 3,000, surrendered when Yu Jin and Zang Ba showed up.

However, after Yu Jin and Zang Ba left, Mei Cheng rebelled again and led his men to join Chen Lan. Zhang Liao led his army to attack the rebels, but was running short of supplies, so Yu Jin headed back and oversaw the transporting of supplies to the frontline to support Zhang Liao. Zhang Liao successfully suppressed the revolt and killed the two rebel leaders.

In recognition of his contributions during the campaign, Yu Jin was awarded an additional 200 taxable households in his marquisate, making it 1,200 households in total. Later, he was promoted to General of the Left () and granted imperial authority. One of his sons was awarded a marquis title and given 500 households in his marquisate.

==Battle of Fancheng==
In 219, when Cao Cao was in Chang&#x27;an, he gave orders to his general Cao Ren to attack Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu at Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei). He also instructed Yu Jin to lead forces to support Cao Ren.

It was in autumn at the time and there were heavy rains. The Han River overflowed and flooded the neighbouring flat lands. The water level reached as high as several &quot;zhang&quot;. Yu Jin&#x27;s seven armies were destroyed in the flood, while Yu Jin himself and his remaining men managed to escape to high ground and were trapped there.

Guan Yu led naval troops to attack Yu Jin. Yu Jin surrendered to Guan Yu, but his subordinate Pang De put up fierce resistance and ended up being captured and executed by Guan Yu when he refused to surrender.

When Cao Cao received news of Yu Jin&#x27;s surrender, he mourned Pang De&#x27;s death for a long time and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve known Yu Jin for 30 years, yet the behaviour he displayed in the face of danger was no better than that displayed by Pang De!&quot;

==Later life and death==
Yu Jin remained as a prisoner-of-war in Guan Yu&#x27;s base in Jing Province until late 219, when Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in the province were captured by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lü Meng in a stealth invasion. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Yu Jin was released and brought to Wu (Sun Quan&#x27;s domain), where he was treated like a guest. However, he was also ridiculed and humiliated by Yu Fan, an official serving under Sun Quan.

Cao Cao died in March 220 and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi. Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor. Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi in 221 and sent Yu Jin back to Wei in autumn.

By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking old man with a head full of grey hair. He knelt down, kowtowed and cried when he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Stabilises Distant Lands ().

Cao Pi wanted to send Yu Jin as his personal representative to meet Sun Quan. Before Yu Jin left, Cao Pi ordered him to visit Cao Cao&#x27;s tomb at Gaoling () in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). There, Yu Jin saw illustrations of the Battle of Fancheng, in which he was depicted surrendering to Guan Yu, while Pang De was portrayed in a ferocious and courageous manner. He was so filled with regret that he fell ill, and then died. Cao Pi granted him the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Li&quot;, which literally means &quot;severe marquis&quot;.

==Family==
Yu Jin&#x27;s son, Yu Gui (), inherited his father&#x27;s title &quot;Marquis of Yishou Village&quot; (). Yu Jin probably had at least one other son, who received a marquis title and 500 households in his marquisate.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Yu Jin&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), named Yu one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Zhang Liao, Yue Jin, Zhang He and Xu Huang. He mentioned that when Cao Cao went to war, these five generals were usually in command of either the vanguard (when making offensives) or the rear guard (when retreating). Yu Jin was known for maintaining high standards of discipline in his unit and for never keeping the spoils of war for himself. As such, he was often awarded a large share of rewards after battles. However, he was very unpopular with his men because he was harsh and unforgiving in enforcing rules and regulations.

Cao Cao disliked Zhu Ling, one of his generals, and had the intention of removing him from his position. He knew that Yu Jin had an intimidating presence so he ordered Yu Jin to take control of Zhu Ling&#x27;s unit. Zhu Ling and his men did not dare to move when Yu Jin showed up at their camp and took over Zhu Ling&#x27;s command. Zhu Ling then became Yu Jin&#x27;s subordinate and all his men obediently submitted to Yu Jin&#x27;s command. Such was Yu Jin&#x27;s ability to strike fear into the hearts of others.

Pei Songzhi, who annotated Yu Jin&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented that even though Yu Jin followed the book when he executed Chang Xi (who surrendered after being surrounded), he had another option – send Chang Xi as a prisoner-of-war to Cao Cao and let his lord decide Chang Xi&#x27;s fate – that was still not considered a violation of the norms. Pei Songzhi felt that Yu Jin deserved his eventual fate – ending up as a prisoner-of-war and receiving a negative-sounding posthumous title (&quot;severe marquis&quot;) after death – because he was unwilling to make an exception for an old friend, was inclined towards killing, and was harsh in suppressing dissent.

The Song dynasty poet Kong Pingzhong (孔平仲; 11th–12 centuries) wrote a poem &quot;General Yu&quot; () describing Yu Jin&#x27;s life:

<text>The Estonia men&#x27;s national football team () represents Estonia in international football matches and is controlled by the Estonian Football Association, the governing body for football in Estonia. Estonia&#x27;s home ground is Lilleküla Stadium in the capital city Tallinn.

The national team&#x27;s first ever match was held against Finland in 1920 and resulted in 6–0 defeat. Estonian footballers have participated only once in the Olympic Games, when they played a single match in the 1924 Olympic Games&#x27; final tournament in Paris, France. They were defeated 1–0 by the United States in first round. During World War II, in 1940, Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union, and there was no possibility of fielding a national football team again until the country restored full independence in August 1991. After the end of the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation, Estonia&#x27;s first FIFA-recognised international match was with Slovenia on 3 June 1992, a 1–1 draw at home in Tallinn.

Estonia has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship. The team has reached the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs, by finishing second in their qualifying group, before being drawn up against Ireland for a play-off tie, making 2011 the &quot;&quot;annus mirabilis&quot; of Estonian football&quot;. They have since repeated this feat by qualifying for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs through being the best group winner in 2022–23 UEFA Nations League D.

Estonia has also participated in the local sub-regional Baltic Cup championship, which takes place every two years between the countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Estonia has won the three-nation Baltic Cup tournament five times — most recently in 2024 — which is less than either of the other two teams in the tournament, Latvia and Lithuania.

The record for the most international caps by an international is held by Konstantin Vassiljev with 158. Martin Reim has 157 caps, who held the European record in 2009 until November of that year. The record for most goals is held by Andres Oper with 38.

==History==
===The Republic of Estonia (1918–1940)===
Estonians were introduced to the game of football by English sailors in the first years of the 20th century, when the land was still part of the Russian Empire. The national team was formed after the war of independence (1918–1920). It played its first match on 17 October 1920 in Helsinki, Finland which ended in a 6–0 defeat. The game took place on a grass surface, which was a first for the Estonians. The Estonian Football Association was founded on 14 December 1921 and affiliated with FIFA in 1923 joining Yugoslavia, Latvia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Uruguay.

Estonia&#x27;s only participation in a major tournament took place at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Estonians lost their only match in the tournament to the United States 1–0.

The Estonian league season usually lasted from the end of May to September. In 1928 the first Baltic football contest was held involving all three nations, it was held nine times during this period. Four of them were held in Latvia, two in Estonia and three in Lithuania. Estonia was particularly notable for winning the edition of the tournament in 1938. In the crucial meeting between them and Latvia at the Kadrioru Stadium, 2,000 out of the 12,000 spectators were Latvians.

Estonia&#x27;s first FIFA World Cup qualifying match took place on 11 June 1933 in Stockholm, Sweden, which ended with a Swedish 6–2 win. This match was also the world&#x27;s first FIFA world cup qualifying match. Since later on Sweden also defeated Lithuania, the match between Estonia and Lithuania was cancelled, because Sweden had already won the group.

Estonia&#x27;s first points in the FIFA World Cup qualifying rounds were gained in 1938, playing the qualification matches in 1937, the third edition of the tournament. At the time teams would play each other once in each group. Estonia were in group one, drawn with Germany, Sweden and Finland. In their first match against Sweden, the team went 2–0 up even before the game reached five minutes of play, only to lose 7–2. This was then followed up with a 1–0 success against Finland in which Richard Kuremaa scored the only goal of the game in the 56th minute. Qualification was completed with a 4–1 defeat against Germany, despite a goal from Georg Siimenson taking the teams in at half time with a 1–0 lead for the Estonians. As a result, Estonia failed to qualify for the World Cup.

The team&#x27;s biggest win came on 26 July 1928 which was a 6–0 success against Lithuania in Tallinn, meanwhile their biggest defeat came on 11 August 1922 which was a 10–2 loss to Finland. Out of the team&#x27;s head coaches before the Second World War, seven of them were Hungarian with Antal Mally taking this position twice. There were four foreign coaches (three Hungarians and one Austrian), while the first Estonian national team was coached by Albert Vollrat in 1932. Coaches also played for several seasons, who also determined the composition of the football association.

Players were mostly in Tallinn clubs, such as TJK, Sport, Kalev and Tallinn Estonia. The republic&#x27;s most capped players were goalkeeper Evald Tipner (67) and the outfield players Eugen Einmann (65), Eduard Ellman-Eelma (58) and Karl-Rudolf Silberg-Sillak (52). Top goal scorers were Ellman-Eelma (21 goals in 65 matches), Richard Kuremaa (18/42), Arnold Pihlak (17/44), Georg Siimenson (14/42) and Friedrich Karm (9/13). Players received small pay for their contributions – 5 Estonian krooni in 1938. The Baltic tournament victory was 50 krooni.

On 18 July 1940 the team played their last official game as an independent nation for more than half a century. The game was played at the Kadrioru Stadium and was a 2–1 victory against Latvia.

===World War II and Soviet occupation (1940–1991)===
In 1940, the Stalinist Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia and, in August 1940, when Estonia was annexed into the USSR, the national team ceased to exist along with the independent country. During German occupation (1941–1944), the team was revived and they played two unofficial friendlies (in Riga 0–4 and in Tallinn 1–8), but only few players remained from the pre-war era. When Soviet troops invaded Estonia again in 1944, some of the best footballers (Richard Kuremaa, Elmar Tepp, Valter Neeris, etc.) were mobilised; some fled to west. Many ex-nationals (Arnold Pihlak, Arnold Laasner, etc.) were in Estonia&#x27;s team in Geislingen&#x27;s refugee camp.

The clubs were renamed in the second half of the 1940s and the traditions started to fade. According to Uno Piir, the first national team manager after Estonia restored independence in 1991, the reason for football&#x27;s downfall in Soviet-occupied Estonia was the inability to create a club competitive at the level of the Soviet Union&#x27;s top clubs, hence the decrease in audience and the favouring of other sports by the governing bodies of sports. Formally, the Estonian SSR had its own representative team, but because of the occupation it did not take part of international competitions. Between 1948 and 1976, the Baltic Cup was held 19 times, which The Byelorussian SSR won a few times and the Estonian SSR five times. From 1969 to 1982, Soviet-occupied Estonia was the only Soviet &quot;union republic&quot; not participating in the Soviet Union&#x27;s football league. During the 1970s, the game lost popularity in Estonia and the sport was mainly played by the Russian immigrant community.

Estonian football-life was relaunched in mid-70s by the attempts of Roman Ubakivi, who formed Estonian-language training groups. The most notable team was Lõvid () in 1980–1989, who were coached by Ubakivi and Olev Reim. Several players, such as Mart Poom and Martin Reim, became part of the national team later. Not a single Estonian reached the Soviet national team, but two Ubakivi&#x27;s pupils, Ott Mõtsnik and Toomas Krõm, broke into the youth team.

The Singing Revolution, the pursuit to restore Estonian independence and to cool regional tensions, found its way to football as well. On 18 July 1990, an exhibition match was held between Estonian and Latvian footballers at Kadriorg Stadium, to remember the last official match between the two teams as independent nations 50 years previously. The principle of assembling the squad was controversial. 63 players made a public addressing (Päevaleht, 24 April 1990) calling out the football governing bodies to only select the descendants of Estonians, leaving out immigrants who came to Estonia after World War II.

===Return to international football (1991–1996)===
Estonia restored its full independence on 20 August 1991, and returned to international football when the team debuted in the Baltic tournament which took place in Lithuania in November 1991. However, the first recognized match did not take place until June 1992 in Tallinn as a friendly against Slovenia (1–1). This historic meeting under the guidance of coach Uno Piir was overseen by a team consisting of Mart Poom, Urmas Hepner, Igor Prins, Urmas Kaljend, Meelis Lindmaa, Toomas Kallaste, Tarmo Linnumäe, Indro Olumets, Martin Reim, Sergei Ratnikov, Risto Kallaste, Viktor Alonen, Urmas Kirs, Marko Kristal and Aleksandr Puštov. Puštov was the scorer of the Estonian goal.

At that time the composition of the squad was influenced by the country&#x27;s citizenship policy. There were disputes whether the national team should include players who lived in Estonia but had not acquired Estonian citizenship. Most of those players in question were of Russian origin. Approximately four months before the first official match against Slovenia, FC Flora presented the Estonian Football Association (EFA) an ultimatum signed by 25 players which stated that &quot;only those who have acquired Estonian citizenship on the basis of legal continuity should be included in the national team&quot;. In July of the same year FIFA gave the right to represent Estonia to 97 non-citizens who were according to EFA born in Estonia and were in the process of acquiring Estonian citizenship. In October the board of EFA made a decision that after the date of 1 April 1993 non-citizens could no more debut in the national team.

The citizenship dispute heated up again in February 1993 when Estonia took part in a three team friendly tournament held in Finland. For the first time , non-citizen players Andrei Borissov and Sergei Bragin were allowed to represent Estonia in the national team. In a statement made on 23 February the government of Estonia urged the Estonian Central Sports Union to &quot;consider manning Estonian sports teams only with Estonian citizens&quot;. On 11 March the local press published an open letter in which the signatories accused EFA and the head coach Uno Piir of using four &quot;alien citizens&quot; (Andrei Borissov, Sergei Bragin, Aleksandr Puštov, Sergei Hohlov-Simson) in games and using Russian as the working language of the national team. The signatories also noted that &quot;most of the positions belonging to Estonians (in youth teams) were filled with non-citizens&quot;. According to Estonian press the EFA had also misled FIFA because most of those 97 players who had gotten the right to represent Estonia had not actually applied for citizenship.

On 5 December 1991 the EFA decided to take part in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament despite financial difficulties, the poor state of the Kadrioru Stadium and the inexperience of the national team. Estonia ended the qualification tournament in the last place of the group and with record of one goal scored and 27 conceded. The team lost nine games and drew once against Malta.

In the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying tournament the team was coached by Roman Ubakivi. The qualification tournament ended without a single point and a goals record of three scored and 31 against. The biggest defeats came from abroad against Croatia (7–1) and Lithuania (5–0).

From 14 October 1993 to 5 October 1996 Estonia played without a victory for almost three years and by February 1996 the team had sunk to 135 in the FIFA World Rankings. Public interest was at a low. In the autumn of 1994 when Estonia hosted Italy at the Kadrioru Stadium only 3000 people came to watch.

===First foreign coach and improved results (1996–2000)===

Results improved with the arrival of the newly independent team&#x27;s first foreign coach, Icelander Teitur Thordarson. His first victory was achieved at the fifth attempt in October 1996, when they defeated Belarus at the Kadriorg Stadium in a 1998 World Cup qualifier with a goal from Hohlov-Simson. After the victory over the Belarusians, the Estonian team gained infamy on 9 October 1996, when a match against Scotland had to be rescheduled after the Estonian team failed to turn up for the game. For unclear reasons, the match was rescheduled to be played on neutral ground in Monaco after it was agreed at a FIFA meeting in Scotland on 7 November, leading to the rescheduled match to take place on 11 February 1997 ending in a 0–0 draw. Reasons for the original postponement of the game was that the Scottish team trained at the Kadriorg the night before, finding the floodlighting inadequate. This matter was raised with the officials who agreed with their concerns. In protest, the Estonians failed to show up, which kicked off only to be stopped seconds later.

At the end of qualifying, the Estonians finished fifth in a field of six teams on a total of four points ahead of Belarus. This was the first time the Belarusians finished last in a qualifying campaign, and had a weaker goal difference. Estonia scored four goals and conceded sixteen.

Estonia also entered the qualifying tournament for Euro 2000. This time round the Estonians recorded three wins and two draws in their group, with fifteen goals scored and seventeen conceded. The team also found themselves in the same group as Scotland, this time losing 3–2 away but drawing 0–0 at home. The Estonian magazine Sporditäht, placed the 1998 events between the pair in their top ten sporting events. On 31 March 1999 the Estonians defeated Lithuania 2–1 in Vilnius. Estonia remained a theoretical possibility to qualify for their first major tournament. Despite failing to qualify, they still set themselves a then team record of 11 points. Their meeting with Scotland on 8 September 1999 was a 5,000 sell-out at the Kadriorg.

===A new stadium and the &quot;Dutch period&quot; (2000–2007)===

Head coach Teitur Thordarson resigned at the end of 1999, leading the Estonian football association to look for a new coach. They were taken over this time by Tarmo Rüütli (who was replaced by caretaker Aivar Lillevere for two games), who was appointed until autumn 2000, and seen the team through their qualifying group for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. After the departure of Rüütli and Lillevere&#x27;s two game stint as caretaker manager, the Estonian Football Association made an agreement with Dutchman Arno Pijpers.

Plans were later set by the football association to build a modern football home in Tallinn, which took place in 2000 and construction began outside of the Lilleküla railway line, giving it its original name of the Lilleküla Stadium. The arena opened on 2 June 2001, ahead of their 2002 World Cup qualifying game against the Netherlands (4–2 defeat). The 9,300 tickets on sale for the match sold out within six hours.

Their campaign for 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification, saw two victories over Andorra and two draws with Cyprus, which gave the team a total of eight points in the final table and fourth place with ten goals scored and 26 against, finishing ahead of those two teams. This was later matched in UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying, where they gained two more wins over Andorra and draws with Croatia and Bulgaria. The team&#x27;s goals record was much more stronger defensively, only conceding six goals in their eight matches while scoring four.

Estonia then most successful tournament came in the qualifying rounds for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, under the supervision of Dutchman and assistant coach of Pijpers Jelle Goes, after Pijpers left the post in 2004. Five wins, two draws and five losses gave them 17 points in their qualification group and fourth place. The team were placed ahead of Latvia, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying was not as successful, which seen the team finish sixth in a field of seven teams, only ahead of Andorra who were also the only team they recorded wins against and gained a total of seven points. The Estonian FA shortly parted company with Goes in June 2007.

===Rüütli&#x27;s head coach again and the anniversary year (2008–present)===
November 2007 saw the approval of a two-year contract for new head coach Tarmo Rüütli, who had overseen the national team in the 1999–2000 season, with this being the last time the team took on an Estonian coach, as Pijpers was the first of three foreign coaches between 2000 and 2007. Rüütli&#x27;s main task in his second term was to lead the team through the 2010 World Cup qualifying matches. The team showed volatile form in friendly matches during 2008. In September, the Estonians lost 3–2 to Belgium in an away qualifying match, but fell to a low ebb after being beaten 7–0 by Bosnia also on their travels, and fell to an all-time low of 137th place in the FIFA World Rankings. The first home game of the campaign was a 3–0 loss to Spain, the reigning European champions. The team still picked up points during the qualification, which included holding Euro 2008 semi-finalists Turkey to a 0–0 draw. Further results were a 1–0 win over Armenia, and a 2–2 draw away from home before the campaign was completed with a 2–0 win against the Belgians. The team collected 8 points finishing fifth in a group of six.

2009 was declared the 100th anniversary of Estonian football. The final matches for record cap holder Martin Reim (6 June versus Equatorial Guinea) and long-standing goalkeeper Mart Poom were held (against Portugal on 10 June). &quot;Sajandi mäng&quot; () was the first ever match versus Brazil, who had arrived in Tallinn as the FIFA World Rankings leaders, and also the five-time world champions, winning 1–0. Much attention was attracted the day after the international friendly, with the Estonian FA announcing that coach Rüütli&#x27;s contract was to be extended to 2011.

Estonia later achieved one of its most famous victories, winning 3–1 in a 2012 European Championship away qualifier on 8 October 2010 against Serbia then ranked 15th in the FIFA rankings. The match took place four months after the Serbian team had competed in the World Cup.

Media attention came from a 2–2 friendly international result with Bulgaria. Two days before the friendly match, on 11 February 2011, bets were placed by officials regarding the outcome of the match. Suspicion of match manipulation was raised when a Hungarian referee gave four disputable penalties, being equally distributed between the two sides. The same team of officials also took charge of the game the day before, an international friendly involving Latvia and Bolivia which ended 2–1 in favour of the Latvians and had also seen three penalties awarded in the game, which were also all of the goals scored.

The Estonian team got an important victory in their next match, which was on 25 March at the Lilleküla Stadium over Uruguay in a friendly match. Former World Cup winners Uruguay had recently reached the semi-finals of the 2010 World Cup and were sitting at 7th place in the FIFA rankings at the time of the 2–0 victory. The captain Raio Piiroja earned his 100th international cap. On 29 March, the good performances continued with a 1–1 home draw against Serbia.

This was followed by a period of poor form, which began with an unofficial friendly game loss to the Basque Country, qualifying defeats to Italy and the Faroe Islands then followed, before a tour of South America saw the team lose to Chile and Uruguay. A 3–0 loss to Turkey in Istanbul then completed their friendly matches cycle before qualifying resumed. However, the &quot;Sinisärgid&quot; won away from home to Slovenia and at home to Northern Ireland, which lifted the team to 58th in the FIFA rankings, giving them their best position to date. This win completed their group matches in the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign.

The regular qualification phase for the Euro 2012 tournament was completed with a win in the final game away to Northern Ireland. Four days later, Serbia failed to beat Slovenia, thus Estonia entered a qualifying play-off against the Republic of Ireland with the first leg in Tallinn. Estonia lost the home game 0–4 but managed a 1–1 draw abroad. The Euro 2012 qualifying campaign was Estonia&#x27;s best to date, with 16 points achieved out of a possible 30, and was the closest that Estonia came to qualifying for a major tournament.

On 5 June 2012, Estonia set a record for being the first team to have played all of UEFA fellow 52 members. Two more sides have been added since 2013 as full UEFA members. Estonia has played the 53rd member, Gibraltar, but has not yet taken on the newest member, Kosovo.

On 15 November 2014, Estonia became the first and so far only team to give up a point to San Marino in the European Championship qualifying tournament, when the two sides played to a 0–0 draw in San Marino.

On Tuesday, 28 March 2017, Estonia gained one of the most famous wins in their history as they beat Croatia 3–0 at home in an international friendly.

On 19 November 2018, Estonia defeated Greece 1–0 in Athens.

On 10 June 2021, Estonia won the Baltic Cup for the 4th time, beating Latvia 2–1 at home, and it&#x27;s the first time after 83 years, since 1938.

==Home stadium==
Home games are played in Tallinn at the Lilleküla Stadium since 2001, its capacity is about 14,400. The stadium borrows its name from its sponsor A. Le Coq, a major Estonian brewery. The stadium was opened on 2 June 2001, for the sold-out World Cup qualifier versus the Netherlands. This is also Estonia&#x27;s largest football stadium. Lilleküla Stadium is also the home of FC Flora.

Their previous home ground was the Kadriorg Stadium, which opened in June 1926 with a 3–1 victory over Lithuania. The Kadriorg holds 5,000 seats and in contrast to the Lilleküla Stadium, stages athletics events on a regular basis.
Estonia have also staged friendly matches away from Tallinn in Kohtla-Järve, Kuressaare, Narva, Pärnu, Rakvere, Tartu, Valga and Viljandi.

==Team image==
===Kit===
The kit of the Estonian national team (home games) traditionally consists of a blue shirt, black shorts and white socks, while a change strip (away games), is that of a white shirt, black shorts and blue socks. Before 1996, other colour combinations have been used. The goalkeeper usually wears a yellow jersey, black shorts and yellow socks. The kit design changes every two years to a new one. Since 1997 the team&#x27;s supplier has been Nike, while between 1992 and 1997 it was supplied by Lotto. Below is a timeline of how the home kit colours have changed through time:

===Supporters===
Estonia&#x27;s main supporters group of that of the &quot;Jalgpallihaigla&quot; (English: &quot;Football Hospital&quot;), with over 600 members. The group is committed to &quot;Deal with all of your supporters issues from ticket distribution in a special fans section, and also with the fans as watchdogs for relations with the Estonian Football Association and their clubs&quot;. Home games see the group as the most vocal, situated in the Southern section of the Lilleküla Stadium.

A busy away journey took place in October 2007, when at Wembley Stadium for the European championship qualifier with England a crowd of two thousand Estonian fans were in attendance.

A large number of away fans have visited Tallinn. In 1938 which was the decisive meeting of the Baltic Cup tournament hosts and Latvia, a total of 12,000 spectators gathered at the Kadriorg Stadium of which 2,000 Latvians. In 2009 1,700 supporters of Bosnia and Herzegovina were at the Lilleküla Stadium.

<text>Crownhill is a suburb in northern Plymouth, in the county of Devon, England. It is the home to Crownhill fort, a popular tourist attraction and museum. According to the 2021 census, Crownhill has a population of 6,411 people. 3,089 are male whereas 3,322 are female. There is an estimate population density (people/km2), of around 2,917.1, with an estimated 2,814 households (according to 2021 census)

==Overview==
It was originally known as Knackersknowle, meaning &quot;the hill of the knacker&#x27;s yard&quot;. In 1860 a fort was built on a high piece of land, just to the north west of the village, on the site of a building called Crown Hill, presumably because of its dominating position overlooking all the surrounding area. The village and surrounding area eventually adopted the same name. The fort was one of many Palmerston Forts built around Plymouth under the instruction of the then Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, as a defence for the dockyard at Devonport against the French. The construction of these forts was eventually found to be unnecessary and as such they have been called &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Follies&quot;. Crownhill Fort has now been restored as a tourist attraction and its guns are fired more often now then they ever were in anger. For a long time Crownhill was predominantly a garrison area with Plumer Barracks and more recently Seaton Barracks, demolished finally in the late 1990s.

This mostly 1930s suburb grew around the junction of the A386 Tavistock Road and the A374 road (later the A38 and now the B3413) from Plympton to Saltash Passage. Following realignment of the A386 in the 1970s the old Tavistock road has been isolated and renamed Morshead Road. There is a pub, a post office, a few convenience stores, many takeaways and an Indian restaurant. Crownhill is the home of the divisional police headquarters and a Catholic boys comprehensive school. There is also a large fire station and close by a big garden centre. The district is very popular because it is very close to the A38 Parkway/Devon Expressway and is near to the local general hospital at Derriford without being so far from the city centre four miles south that it is isolated and inaccessible as are so many of Plymouth&#x27;s satellite suburbs.

Crownhill is mostly known for being the main place in the book &quot;Witchhill&quot; by Marcus Segdwick.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Union Street (Last Post)&quot;, a track on the 2006 album &quot;Witness&quot; by contemporary West Country folk duo Show of Hands, features Crownhill as the home of one of the song&#x27;s subjects. The song tells a tale of love and loss amongst the pubs and clubs of Union Street at the time of the Falklands Conflict.

<doc id="1006179" wikidata="Q7543083" url="?curid=1006179" title="Avenue (landscape)">
<text>In landscaping, an avenue (from the French), alameda (from the Portuguese and Spanish), or allée (from the French), is a straight path or road with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side, which is used, as its Latin source &quot;venire&quot; (&quot;to come&quot;) indicates, to emphasize the &quot;coming to,&quot; or &quot;arrival&quot; at a landscape or architectural feature. In most cases, the trees planted in an avenue will be all of the same species or cultivar, so as to give uniform appearance along the full length of the avenue.

The French term &quot;allée&quot; is used for avenues planted in parks and landscape gardens, as well as boulevards such as the &quot;Grande Allée&quot; in Quebec City, Canada, and &quot;Karl-Marx-Allee&quot; in Berlin.

==History==
The avenue is one of the oldest implements in the history of gardens. An Avenue of Sphinxes still leads to the tomb of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. Avenues similarly defined by guardian stone lions lead to the Ming tombs in China. British archaeologists have adopted highly specific criteria for &quot;avenues&quot; within the context of British archaeology.

In French formal garden Baroque landscape design style, avenues of trees that were centered upon the dwelling radiated across the landscape. See the avenues in the Gardens of Versailles or Het Loo. Other late 17th-century French and Dutch landscapes, in that intensely ordered and flat terrain, fell naturally into avenues; Meindert Hobbema, in &quot;The Avenue at Middelharnis&quot; (1689) presents such an avenue in farming country, neatly flanked at regular intervals by rows of young trees that have been rigorously limbed up; his central vanishing point mimics the avenue&#x27;s propensity to draw the spectator forwards along it.

In Austria-Hungary, the fashion for establishing representative avenues appeared as early as the Renaissance and reached its peak in the Baroque period. Avenues lined the access roads to chateaus and manors, as well as pilgrimage routes and Stations of the Cross. The manorial landscape architecture was followed by &quot;folk landscaping&quot; with wayside chapels, crosses and shrines accompanied by trees. Later, Maria Theresa decreed in 1752 to plant trees along the new imperial roads for economic, aesthetic, orientation and safety reasons. Most avenues were created during the reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph II. At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, new landscaping came from England, and formal aesthetics were replaced by the aesthetics of the natural landscape. During Napoleonic wars, pyramidal poplars became a new element, popular due to their fast growth and distinctive shape. Also in the middle of the 19th century, when the construction of imperial roads continued, but at the same time a network of non-state side roads was created, the law ordered the planting of avenues along them, especially fruit trees and mulberries. Many baroque alleys have aged and been felled, and fruit tree alleys have become increasingly popular. At the time of the development of motoring, the oldest avenues often hinder the widening and modernization of rural roads and are the subject of dispute between conservationists and traffic safety requirements.

==Design==

To enhance the approach to mansions or manor houses, avenues were planted along the entrance drive. Sometimes the avenues are in double rows on each side of a road. Trees preferred for avenues were selected for their height and speed of growth, such as poplar, beech, lime, and horse chestnut. In the American antebellum era South, the southern live oak was typically used, because the trees created a beautiful shade canopy.

Sometimes tree avenues were designed to direct the eye toward some distinctive architectural building or feature, such as a chapels, gazebos, or architectural follies.

==Street name==

===Origin===
Avenue as a street name in French, Spanish (&quot;avenida&quot;) and other languages implies a large straight street in a city, often created as part of a large scheme of urban planning such as Baron Haussmann&#x27;s remodelling of Paris or the L&#x27;Enfant Plan for Washington D.C.; &quot;avenues&quot; will typically be the main roads. This pattern is very often followed in the United States, indeed all the Americas, but in the United Kingdom this sense is less strong and the name is used more randomly, mostly for suburban streets developed in the 20th century, though Western and Eastern Avenues in London are main traffic arteries out of the city, if not very straight.

===Cities===
In cities which have a grid-based naming system, such as the borough of Manhattan in New York City, there may be a convention that the streets called avenues run parallel in one direction – roughly north–south in the case of Manhattan – while &quot;streets&quot; run at 90 degrees to them across the avenues; roughly east–west in Manhattan. In Washington, DC the avenues radiate from the centre running diagonally across the grid of streets, which follows typical French usage of the name (in France &quot;boulevards&quot; are often main roads running round the city centre). In Phoenix, Arizona, &quot;the avenues&quot; can colloquially mean &quot;the west side of town&quot;, due to the numbered north–south-running roads being called &quot;Avenues&quot; in the western part of the city, separated from the eastern &quot;Streets&quot; by a &quot;Central Avenue&quot;. Similarly, &quot;the avenues&quot; in San Francisco, California refers to the Richmond District and the Sunset District, the two neighborhoods on the Pacific coast, north and south of Golden Gate Park, respectively.

In Anglophone urban or suburban settings, &quot;avenue&quot; is one of the usual suite of words used in street names, along with &quot;boulevard&quot;, &quot;circle&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, &quot;drive&quot;, &quot;lane&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, &quot;terrace&quot;, &quot;way&quot;, &quot;gate&quot; and so on, any of which may carry connotations as to the street&#x27;s size, importance, or function. Avenues were usually lined with trees when first built, although many avenues have lost their trees to make way for overhead wiring, parking or to allow light into properties.

<doc id="1006181" wikidata="Q510160" url="?curid=1006181" title="William II de La Marck">
<text>William II de la Marck (Lummen, 1542 – Bishopric of Liège, 1 May 1578) (Dutch: &quot;Willem II van der Marck&quot;) was the Lord of Lumey and initially admiral of the Watergeuzen, the so-called &#x27;sea beggars&#x27; who fought in the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), together with among others William the Silent, Prince of Orange-Nassau. He was the great-grandson of an equally notorious character, baron William de la Marck, nicknamed the &quot;wild boar of the Ardennes&quot;.

On 1 April 1572 – the day of the Capture of Brielle – the Sea Beggars were led by De la Marck, and by two of his captains, Willem Bloys van Treslong and Lenaert Jansz de Graeff. After they were expelled from England by Elizabeth I, they needed a place to shelter their 25 ships. As they sailed towards Brill, they were surprised to find out that the Spanish garrison had left in order to deal with trouble in Utrecht. On the evening of 1 April, the 600 men sacked the undefended port.

A Calvinist, who opposed Catholicism, on 9 July 1572 he had executed the Martyrs of Gorkum, 19 Dutch Catholic priests and religious who were ultimately canonized in 1865. Their crime was their refusal to abandon their belief in the Blessed Sacrament and in papal supremacy, even under torture. Lumey&#x27;s action was contrary to orders he received from William the Silent. He also played a part in the murder of Cornelis Musius.

Having conquered South-Holland and controlling North-Holland and Zeeland, on 20 June 1572 Lumey was appointed stadtholder of Holland and consequently Captain General, i.e. military Commander in Chief of the conquered territories. It has never been evidenced that Lumey recognized either the authority or the seniority of the Prince of Orange, who was eventually recognized as the leader of the Low Countries&#x27; uprising against the King Philip II of Spain.

In 1576 Lumey was banned from the Netherlands, either by the States of Holland or the Prince of Orange. He is said to have participated in the lost Battle of Gembloux against the Spanish. He went back to his homeland, the Bishopric of Liège, where on 1 May 1578 he died in his residence on Mont-Saint-Martin. There are two different accounts offered for the circumstances of his death, one that he died of the bite of a mad dog or that he was poisoned while in prison.

There is evidence that the earthly remains of William van der Marck are stowed away in a casket, that is bricked up in the Arenberg-family crypt under the former Capuchin Monastery Church at Enghien, today located in Belgium.

==In popular culture==

* He is featured as a recurring character in the Dutch comic series &quot;Gilles de Geus&quot; by Hanco Kolk and Peter de Wit.
* He also appears in Cecelia Holland&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Sea Beggars&quot;, who changed some of the details of his life.
* Two streets in the Geuzenwijk in Utrecht have been named after him: Lumeystraat en Van der Marckstraat. Streets in Rotterdam and The Hague have also been named after him.

<doc id="1006182" wikidata="Q5163020" url="?curid=1006182" title="Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua">
<text>The Conservative Alliance (Matanitu Vanua in Fijian) was a right-wing political party in Fiji, and a member of the ruling coalition government. It was commonly known as the CAMV, a combination of the initials of its English and Fijian names. At its annual general meeting on 17 February 2006, the party voted to dissolve itself and merge with its coalition partner, the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL). The President of the party at the time of its dissolution was Ratu Tanoa Cakobau, a Bauan chief, while Ratu Josefa Dimuri served as General Secretary. For legal reasons, Parliamentary members of the disbanded party maintained a separate caucus in the House of Representatives, under the leadership of Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, until the end of the parliamentary term, on 27 March 2006.

== Party founding ==
The Conservative Alliance was publicly launched at Furnival Park in Toorak, Suva, on 15 June 2001 by defectors who broke away from the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, which had governed the country from 1992 to 1999, when it lost the general elections held that year. As part of its founding ideology, the party emphasized that the offices of President and Prime Minister should be reserved for indigenous Fijians, and that Christianity should be constitutionally established as the country&#x27;s official religion. Among those attending the launch was the Rev. Tomasi Kanailagi, President of the Methodist Church. Ratu Epenisa Cakobau, a Kubuna chief, was appointed President of the party, with Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu of Tovata and Ro Alivereti Tuisawau of Burebasaga as the two Vice-Presidents, thus representing at the apex of the party the leading chiefly clans from the three confederacies to which all Fijian chiefs belong. Ratu Josefa Dimuri was appointed General Secretary of the party.

== The 2001 election ==
George Speight, who led the civilian coup d&#x27;état against the elected government of Mahendra Chaudhry in May 2000, joined the new party, as did many of his supporters. In the parliamentary election held to restore democracy in August 2001, the party fielded candidates in 36 of the 71 electorates. Six of their candidates were elected to the House of Representatives, including Speight. (Unable to take his seat due to his imprisonment on treason charges, Speight was subsequently expelled from Parliament for nonattendance, and his brother, Samisoni Tikoinasau, won the ensuing byelection to fill the vacancy).

To secure a legislative majority, the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase forged a coalition agreement with the Conservative Alliance. The party initially insisted on Speight&#x27;s release from jail as the price of its participation in the government, but later dropped this demand. The then leader of the party, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, was appointed Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two members of the caucus were appointed to the Cabinet. Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu became Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, and Isireli Leweniqila became Minister for Youth, Employment Opportunities, and sport. As part of a deal brokered between the military and the insurrectionists, Ratu Jope Seniloli, another party stalwart, had already been appointed Vice-President in September 2000, following the end of the rebellion.

=== Alleged FLP offer ===
At the annual general meeting held to dissolve the party on 17 February 2006, coup-convict Simione Drole claimed that the Fiji Labour Party had made an offer to the CAMV after the 2001 election. All six CAMV parliamentarians, including coup frontsman George Speight, would be given Cabinet office; one of them would be offered the post of Prime Minister. All prisoners held on coup-related offences would also be freed in return for CAMV support, Fiji Live quoted Drole as saying. &quot;This information was relayed to us on Nukulau by CAMV lawyer Kitione Vuataki,&quot; Drole told the meeting. He went on to claim that the CAMV had made the very difficult decision to refuse the offer; the prospect of freedom was tempting, he said, but the priority was to ensure that an ethnic Fijian government held office.

FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry rejected Drole&#x27;s claims as &quot;utter lies.&quot; &quot;Drole should have his head examined,&quot; he said.

== Arrest of CAMV members ==
In 2004, a number of high-profile members of the Conservative Alliance were arrested and charged with treason for their roles in the 2000 coup. On 6 August 2004, Vice-President Seniloli and Deputy Speaker Vakalalabure were convicted and sentenced to terms of four and six years&#x27; imprisonment respectively. Youth, Employment, and Sports Minister Leweniqila was acquitted; Justice Nazhat Shameem accepted his defence that he had been coerced into taking an illegal oath of office during the coup.

Anxious to retain the support of his coalition partner, and shore up his electoral base in the Bau-Tailevu region, in which Seniloli is an influential chief, Prime Minister Qarase said that he was &quot;dismayed by the severity of the sentences&quot; handed down. His government indicated, however, that it would not interfere with the due process of law. On 29 November 2004, however, Attorney General Qoriniasi Bale announced that the government had decided to parole Seniloli on health grounds, in return for his resignation.

A similar scenario unfolded in the trial of Ratu Lalabalavu, the party leader, and Senator &quot;Ratu&quot; Josefa Dimuri, also a party member. On 3 April 2005, Lalabalavu and Dimuri were convicted of unlawful assembly for their role aiding and abetting the 2000 coup by visiting rebels at the Sukanaivalu Barracks on 4 July that year, and were sentenced to eight months&#x27; imprisonment. They were released on parole after serving just eleven days of their sentences.

Opposition politicians charged that the release of Seniloli, Lalabalavu, and Dimuri was for political reasons, as the six votes of the Conservative Alliance are needed to maintain the government&#x27;s parliamentary majority. The military also criticized their release. This led to a series of exchanged in April 2005, with the Conservative Alliance accusing the military of meddling in politics, and the military in turn charging that Alliance politicians included many who had &quot;created havoc&quot; in the 2000 coup. In a strongly worded statement on 25 April 2005, army spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni declared, &quot;The RFMF would like to remind the CAMV that they were the very people who created the havoc from which the country is still trying to recover.&quot;

Trials of persons implicated in the 2000 coup, many of them Conservative Alliance members, are continuing.

== Controversies, 2005-2006 ==
A power struggle between the President and General Secretary of the party took place in September 2005. On 30 July 2005, Cakobau signed an agreement with four other parties to establish an electoral coalition of parties supported mostly by indigenous Fijians to contest the general election scheduled for 2006. Sivo opposed the decision, and said that Cakobau had acted without proper authority. Each subsequently called on the other to resign, and on 9 August, Cakobau said that he expected Sivo to be replaced by his predecessor, Ratu Josefa Dimuri. Sivo countered that he had no intention of relinquishing his position, and said that he could be only removed if the party judged him unfit for the post. He reiterated on 16 September that he would not stand aside for Dimuri. Responding to a letter that Cakobau had sent to Dimuri reinstating him, Sivo said that Cakobau had no such powers. He accused him of taking advantage of the famous Cakobau name to make unilateral decisions that were beyond his authority.

The public disagreement between Cakobau and Sivo appeared to be related to a wider debate about the policies and effectiveness of the party as a member of the ruling coalition. Without naming particular individuals, Sivo criticized certain colleagues on the CAMV executive on 17 September of being too subservient to the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua, the dominant partner in the ruling coalition. The party should have pushed for the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill three years ago, Sivo said. The controversial legislation, promoted by the government in 2005, proposed to establish a commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup, many of whom were supporters of the CAMV.

== Policies ==
The CAMV contested the 2001 election on a platform calling for a greater emphasis on indigenous rights and the proclamation of Christianity (the faith of most ethnic Fijians, but relatively few Indo-Fijians), as the official religion of Fiji. Officially, the party accepts the 1997 Constitution, calling it &quot;a workable document,&quot; but in practice many of its elected representatives have strongly criticised it.

Despite its strongly nationalist image, reinforced by the arrest and conviction of many of its members for participation in the 2000 coup, the CAMV claims to espouse nonracial policies. The party President, Ratu Tanoa Cakobau, said on 8 June 2005 that anybody respected by the population could be Prime Minister, regardless of his or her race or status. He said this in response to a comment from Poseci Bune, Deputy Leader of the Fiji Labour Party, that the country should be ready for a non-indigenous Prime Minister.

== Merger with SDL ==

Party President Ratu Tanoa Cakobau announced on 9 February 2006 that the party would contest Fijian communal and open constituencies in the upcoming election. In another development, however, it was announced on 16 February 2006 that the party would be deregistering, in order to merge with the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) ahead of the elections.

Fiji Television reported on 20 February that a letter alleged to have been written by Ratu Tanoa Cakobau had requested that the six CAMV parliamentarians be endorsed, unopposed, as SDL candidates. The SDL confirmed having received letter, written in Fijian and addressed to Prime Minister Qarase and to the SDL President, but Cakobau said that some portions of it were not authentic; his name had been written differently from the way he uses it official correspondence, he said.

The Prime Minister responded that all candidacies for the SDL were open, and that there would be no automatic endorsement of candidates, ex-CAMV or otherwise. All would have to go through the required selection procedure.

The next day, Fiji Live revealed that in addition to the six parliamentarians, five other CAMV figures were seeking endorsement as SDL candidates.

Radio New Zealand quoted Party President Ratu Tanoa Cakobau as saying on 28 February that the party had sacrificed little in its merger with the SDL. The party had abandoned its goal of freeing all coup convicts as long ago as 2002, he claimed. &quot;We had to reconsider everything, in the beginning we were all out for everything, but then we realised that there’s something called the law that we had to respect, we had to follow. And through that process most of my party members, except myself, went to jail,&quot; Cakobau said.

The merger was not quite finalized until 3 July 2006, when the party was officially deregistered. General Secretary Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure said on 28 February that the party was seeking legal advice after questions had been raised concerning the legality of the merger; his successor as General Secretary, Ropate Sivo, had said that CAMV parliamentarians could not legally remain in office if their political party was dissolved. Official deregistration, therefore, would likely have to await the end of the current parliamentary session, a stance he reiterated on 3 March. Sivo, for his part, told Fiji Live that he planned to meet Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry to discuss the matter. On 20 February, however, Prime Minister Qarase said that there was no question of the six CAMV parliamentarians being disqualified. Despite the dissolution of the party, they would continue to sit under the auspices of the CAMV, he said.

The Fiji Sun reported on 10 March that CAMV parliamentarian and lawyer Niko Nawaikula had inquired of the Supervisor of Elections about the procedures to follow for deregistering the party.

=== Factors influencing the merger ===

The decision to deregister the party was formalized at the party&#x27;s annual general meeting the next day. Despite some dissent, the motion was passed on a voice vote. Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu told the meeting that in accordance with Fijian protocol, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo had been informed of the decision, as had the chiefs of Vanua Levu, Naitasiri, and Tailevu - the areas where the party has the most support. The party executive called on all indigenous-led parties to follow their lead and unite under the banner of the SDL, in order to present the electorate with a united front to guarantee continued indigenous national leadership. Lalabalavu said that the party was concerned about continued imprisonment of persons convicted of the Fiji coup of 2000, many of them CAMV supporters, but considered that the SDL-led government was addressing that matter through its Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill.

The Fiji Live news service claimed on 19 February that financial considerations may have played a role in the decision to disband the CAMV. The SDL had reportedly donated F$15,000 to pay the legal fees of prominent citizens, many of them CAMV supporters, who were implicated in the 2000 coup a point highlighted at the CAMV meeting. The party leader, Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, was also quoted as telling opponents of the merger that their failure to contribute to the party&#x27;s coffers had left it with insufficient funds to continue as a viable party. Party treasurer Jone Kauvesi concurred, saying that the CAMV bank account of F$36,351.07 on 26 May 2004 had been boosted to F$50,713.36 on 7 July by the SDL donation, but by February 2006 his had been depleted and only F$3235.31 remained. The bulk of the fund - over F$31,000 had gone in legal fees, Kauvesi said, with the Abhay Singh and Associates legal firm alone being paid F$7,400. Travel, funeral expenses, advertising in newspapers, byelection campaigns, and meetings had accounted for the rest.

The SDL appeared to see the merger from a different point of view from the CAMV. According to a Radio New Zealand report on 18 February, SDL campaign director Jale Baba said that the CAMV had dissolved of its own accord and joined the SDL, not that the two parties had merged. &quot;In fact there’s a misconception that there’s a merger between the two parties. What has happened is that the CAMV has decided to wind up that party and for them to become members of the SDL party,&quot; Baba said.

=== Reaction to the merger ===

The Fiji Sun quoted former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka as hailing the merger as &quot;the way forward for the Fijian people.&quot; Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party general secretary Viliame Savu, however, condemned the merger.

Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that the merger could misfire. He doubted that all CAMV supporters would transfer their allegiance to the SDL, thinking it more likely that some would move to other parties at election time. United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes similarly judged the decision to be unwise. Fiji Village quoted him on the 19th as saying that the merger could further polarize Fiji&#x27;s ethnic communities.

The Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), from which the CAMV originally broke away, said on 23 February 2006 that not all CAMV members supported the merger with the SDL. Ema Druavesi, General Secretary of the SVT, told the Fiji Village news service that the door was open for former CAMV members to join the SVT.

People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) General Secretary Meli Bogileka also criticized the merger, and said that the PNP was reconsidering its position in the Grand Coalition Initiative Group.

In a statement written in Fijian and released on 22 February, the Military criticized the merger as a sign of increasing ethno-nationalism, which it described as a threat to the country&#x27;s long-term stability. For the SDL to accept the CAMV members into its ranks was a betrayal of the trust the Military had invested in Qarase when appointing him Prime Minister in 2000 and supporting him subsequently, Fiji Live (23 February) reported the statement as saying. The 23 February edition of the Fiji Times quoted Rabukawaqa as saying that certain political elements would stop at nothing to pursue their personal political ambitions. &quot;&#x27;They wish to continue to keep the masses in abject poverty so that they can be beguiled by the continued lie of foreigners wanting to take their land from them,&quot;&quot; Rabukawaqa said. Rabukawaqa said that nationalism was a good thing when it was state based, but could only lead to hatred and instability if based on ethnicity.

== A new CAMV? ==

CAMV members objecting to the merger with the SDL included Ropate Sivo, the former General Secretary. He told Fiji Village that he was seeking legal advice on whether the vote to dissolve the party had been conducted legally. He had visited Metuisela Mua, Eroni Lewaqai and Viliame Sousouwai in prison (where they are serving for coup-related offences) and had been advised by them to pursue legal action, he said. George Speight and the former leader, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure were also adamantly opposed to the merger, he claimed.

Sivo reiterated his opposition to the merger on 27 February, saying that it breached the constitution of the party. Only the management board could authorize a dissolution, and Tailevu was the only Province represented at the meeting, the Fiji Sun quoted him as claiming. The move was a private agreement between the SDL and Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, he said, adding that many who disagreed with the merger were remaining silent only because of their traditional obligation to Lalabalavu as a Paramount Chief. He made a strong attack on Prime Minister Qarase, calling on him to resign, and mooted the establishment of a new party under the old CAMV label.

Sivo rejected claims made by General Secretary Ratu Josefa Dimuri that the party had begun in the north of the country and largely built by Lalabalvu, Isireli Leweniqila, and himself. On the contrary, Sivo claimed that the groundwork had been laid by Vakalalabure, his brother Ratu Tevita, and himself; Sivo had provided part of his own restaurant in Suva for a party office, he claimed. &quot;These people joined the bandwagon when it was up and running. That is why they don’t have the foresight to complete the work we have started, and that is to fulfill the aspirations of the Fijian people and the release of our brothers in jail,&quot; the Fiji Sun (1 March) quoted him as saying. He accused Dimuri of failing to read a letter at the meeting held to dissolve the party; Dimuri countered by saying that no such letter had been received. Sivo affirmed his belief in the ideals articulated by the Speight-led Taukei Cabinet on 19 May 2000, saying that they would never die.

Countering Sivo&#x27;s version, the Fiji Times (2 March) quoted Dimuri as saying that the meeting to dissolve the party had been attended by over four hundred cadres and that the decision to join the SDL had been nearly unanimous. He rejected Sivo&#x27;s claims about the origins of the party, saying that he personally had registered the party in Labasa. He also denied that George Speight had opposed the decision, saying that if he had objected to the dissolution of the party, he would have informed his brother and CAMV Cabinet Minister Samisoni Tikoinasau, who visited him regularly in prison.

Fiji Live quoted a Fiji Sun report on 13 June 2006 as saying that Sivo had announced plans to revive the party, with a view to campaigning for the release of George Speight and other parties to the 2000 coup.

==Revival==

On 9 September 2008, former members of the Conservative Alliance applied to re-register the party with the Electoral Commission so it can contest the next election. The new incarnation of the party will be led by Ropate Sivo.

<text>Eggbuckland is a suburb of the city of Plymouth, in the ceremonial county of Devon, England. Before the Second World War Eggbuckland was a small village a few miles north of Plymouth. During the reconstruction of Plymouth many new suburbs were built and soon a new estate was built within one mile to the south east of Eggbuckland. During the 1970s the areas in between and surrounding the old village were all developed and the whole area is now referred to by the name Eggbuckland. The development of the A38 just south of Eggbuckland in the 1980s led to the area becoming very popular with commuters.

Bocheland is of Saxon origin and means &quot;Royal land held by charter&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that this manor was held by the King, William of Normandy, but was granted to the Saxon Heche or Ecca, thus the land was known as Heche or Ecca&#x27;s Bocheland. This was the site of a Saxon church which was replaced by the present church of St Edward in 1470. The village was held by the Royalist Cavaliers during the Civil War against the Parliamentarian Roundheads and was badly damaged.

During the 19th century the area was host to new Palmerston Forts built as part of a northern defense line around Plymouth. Much of the structures remain but are privately owned and used for differing purposes.

Over time the name has been corrupted and by 1685 was Egg Buckland. By 1902, it was one word - Eggbuckland although the older usage is still seen around the city.

In the 1870s, the original village was described thus in John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales:

:EGG-BUCKLAND, or Buckland-Egg, a parish in Plympton-St. Mary district, Devon; on the Dartmoor railway, adjacent to the Tavistock railway, and near the river Plym, 3 miles NNE of Plymonth. It contains Crabtree hamlet, and part of Knackers-Knowle village; and its post town is Knackers-Knowle, Devon. Acres, with Laira-Green, 3, 304; of which 100 are water. Real property, £8, 933; of which £68 are in quarries, and £36 in railways. Pop., 1, 348. Houses, 272. The property is much subdivided. Widey Court here was the headquarters of Prince Maurice during his siege of Plymouth, and was visited by the king. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Exeter. Value, £474.* Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church is ancient: consists of nave, south aisle, and chancel, with a tower; and is in fair condition. Charities, £28.

In 1931 the civil parish of Egg Buckland had a population of 2494. On 1 April 1939 the parish was abolished and merged with Plymouth and Bickleigh.

The suburb is home to Eggbuckland Community College and several primary schools.

<text>WWNC (570 kHz) is a commercial radio station in Asheville, North Carolina. It broadcasts a talk format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. The station&#x27;s studios and transmitter site are on Summerlin Road in Asheville.

WWNC&#x27;s programming features Glenn Beck and &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show&quot; in middays, &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; in afternoons, &quot;The Ramsey Show&quot; in evenings and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; in overnights. Mark Starling hosts a local program in mornings.

==History==
===Early years===
WWNC is Asheville&#x27;s oldest radio station, and among the oldest in North Carolina. It was first licensed, as WABC, on June 24, 1925, to the Asheville Battery Company at 19 Haywood Street. As of June 30, 1926, the station was listed on 1180 kHz with a transmitter power of 20 watts.

In late 1926, it was announced that an application had been filed to transfer ownership of WABC to the Asheville Chamber of Commerce, and change its call sign to WWNC, which stood for &quot;Wonderful Western North Carolina&quot;. This allowed A. H. Grebe to transfer the WABC call sign to a New York City station, which was licensed to the Atlantic Broadcasting Company.

 The Chamber also financed a major upgrade, which included a power increase to 1,000 watts, and relocated the transmitter site to atop the Flatiron Building. This new configuration made its debut broadcast on February 21, 1927, at 7:00 pm. The station has traditionally recognized this as its founding date. On November 11, 1928, WWNC was moved to its current frequency of 570 kHz, as part of the implementation of the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40. The Citizen Broadcasting Company acquired the station on February 4, 1929.

The studios were at the Vanderbilt Hotel. Other broadcast locations have included the Flatiron Building and the &quot;Citizen-Times&quot; Building when it was owned by the daily newspaper. For most of its early years, WWNC was powered at 1,000 watts.

In its early days, WWNC provided weather and road reports, and music at night. Country legend Jimmie Rodgers and Bascom Lamar Lunsford were among the stars who performed on the station. Information included &quot;local sporting events, crop futures and farmers markets, and social and economic affairs (billed as being everything &#x27;from house work to bridge&#x27;).&quot; WWNC also aired church services. Because the station could be heard throughout the Eastern United States and even in Canada and Mexico, WWNC became valuable in attracting tourists. On October 10, 1931, WWNC changed its affiliation from CBS Radio to the NBC Red Network.

===Popular shows===
On September 10, 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke at McCormick Field. WWNC broadcast the speech. The station was the Western North Carolina home to &quot;Amos and Andy&quot;, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and &quot;Jack Benny&quot;. In 1938, WWNC was one of the many stations broadcasting Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

The first time the world heard Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys was February 2, 1939, at 3:30 pm when the group played a fifteen-minute segment on &quot;Mountain Music Time&quot;. At the time, WWNC was an NBC affiliate, owned by the &quot;Asheville Citizen-Times&quot;. Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys played the daily 3:30-3:45 &quot;Mountain Music&quot; spot until April 1, 1939. On that date, WWNC left NBC and rejoined CBS.

On September 28, 1953, the &quot;Asheville Citizen-Times&quot; and WWNC were sold to Roger C. Peace and J. Kelly Sisk, owners of the &quot;Greenville News&quot; and &quot;Piedmont&quot; and WFBC in Greenville, South Carolina; the $2.3 million deal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that November. In September 1967, the News-Piedmont Company and its associated companies announced that they would merge to form Multimedia, Inc., by January 1, 1968.

===MOR and country===
As network programming moved from radio to television, WWNC switched to a full service, middle of the road (MOR) format, including popular adult music, news and sports. In 1969, WWNC switched from MOR to country music.

In the days before FM became popular, WWNC was sometimes the highest-rated station in the United States with an Arbitron share over 40 percent, occasionally as high as 50 percent for morning drive time disc jockey Scotty Rhodarmer. It was the top station in the Asheville radio market for many years.

Heritage Broadcast Group purchased WWNC from Multimedia, Inc., for $7.25 million in 1987. Heritage already owned WISE and WKSF in Asheville; it would sell WISE to United Broadcasting Enterprises a few months later. In 1993, Heritage sold WWNC and WKSF to Osborn Communications, in a $22.5 million deal that also included WAAX and WQEN in Gadsden, Alabama; WFKS in Palatka, Florida; and WOLZ in Fort Myers, Florida. Capstar Broadcasting Partners purchased Osborn for $100 million in 1996.

Capstar and Chancellor Media announced in August 1998 that they would merge (Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst was a major shareholder in both companies); upon the merger&#x27;s completion in July 1999, the combined company was named AMFM Inc. AMFM was in turn acquired by Clear Channel Communications (forerunner to iHeartMedia) in a deal announced on October 4, 1999, and completed in August 2000.

===Talk radio===
In 2002, WWNC changed its format from country music (except for the Scotty Rhodarmer morning show) to all-talk, taking over talk shows previously heard on WTZY (now WPEK). In 2004, Rhodarmer retired as WWNC morning host after more than 40 years in the position and 50 years as a station employee. In 1979, he had 56 percent of the audience according to Arbitron, more than any other local radio personality. His theme song was &quot;Carolina in the Morning&quot;. On June 18, 2010, many of the former DJs had a reunion. They included Rhodarmer, Frank Byrd, Wiley Carpenter, John Roten, John Anderson and Randy Houston.

Western Carolina University broadcast a program in December 2010 on WWNC recreating Welles&#x27; 1938 broadcast of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, including Arthur Anderson, who at age 16 performed with Welles in the original broadcast.

<doc id="1006186" wikidata="Q144348" url="?curid=1006186" title="Zaifeng, Prince Chun">
<text>Zaifeng (12 February 1883 – 3 February 1951), also known as Tsai Feng, Prince of Ch&#x27;ün, formally known by his title [[Prince Chun (醇)|Prince Chun]], was a Manchu prince and regent of the late Qing dynasty. He was a son of Yixuan, the seventh son of the Daoguang Emperor, and the father of Puyi, the Last Emperor. He served as prince regent from 1908 to 1911 during the reign of his son until the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911.

==Family background==

Zaifeng was born on 12 February of the 9th year of the Guangxu Emperor in the Aisin Gioro clan as the fifth son of Yixuan (Prince Chun). He was the second of Prince Chun&#x27;s sons who managed to survive into adulthood. His mother was Liugiya Cuiyan, who was a maid in Prince Chun&#x27;s residence before becoming one of the prince&#x27;s concubines. Born to a Han bannerman family, her family name was &quot;Liu&quot; (劉) but was later changed to the Manchu-sounding &quot;Liugiya&quot; (劉佳) after she married Prince Chun and was transferred to a Manchu banner.

In 1875, after the childless Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s death, Zaifeng&#x27;s elder half-brother, Zaitian was selected by the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci&#x27;an to be the new emperor. Zaitian was &quot;adopted&quot; by the empress dowagers as their son, which meant he was no longer nominally Prince Chun&#x27;s son. He was then enthroned as the Guangxu Emperor. Prince Chun, as the biological father of the reigning emperor, received the highest accolades as well as high rank in the imperial court. In addition, he also had a close relationship with Empress Dowager Cixi, and his primary consort, Yehenara Wanzhen, was one of Cixi&#x27;s sisters. In January 1891, after Prince Chun&#x27;s death, an eight-year-old Zaifeng immediately inherited his father&#x27;s princely title and became the second Prince Chun.

In 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, when the armies of the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied Beijing, Prince Chun&#x27;s fiancée reportedly committed suicide to prevent herself from being raped and humiliated by the foreign invaders.

==Life in the government==

Around late February or early March 1901, Prince Chun was appointed as an army inspector by the Qing imperial court, which had moved to Xi&#x27;an after evacuating Beijing. In June 1901, at the insistence of the foreign powers, the 18-year-old Prince Chun was appointed by as a Special Ambassador to offer regrets on behalf of the Qing government to Germany for the murder of German diplomat Baron von Ketteler. In July, Prince Chun left for Germany by sea and met Kaiser Wilhelm II in Potsdam in September. Although he first planned to subsequently tour around Europe and visit Belgium and London, he had to cancel his plans and return to China prematurely because of health issues of Empress Dowager Cixi.

Empress Dowager Cixi was pleased with how Prince Chun executed his diplomatic mission in Germany. He allegedly refused to kneel in front of the Kaiser even when the Germans insisted; the diplomatic slight was forgiven thanks to the negotiation skills of his adviser, Liang Cheng. During his time in Germany, Prince Chun also attended troop inspections with the Kaiser and his brother Prince Heinrich.

Due to his success, Prince Chun was subsequently given several key appointments over the following years. At the same time, Cixi grew wary of Prince Chun because the latter was a favorite of foreign powers. In fact, one reason why Prince Chun took up so many important positions in the imperial court after 1901 was that he was a protégé of the foreign powers, which Cixi was careful not to displease. However, she was as intent as ever on thwarting any challenge to her power, and so Prince Chun clearly posed a problem for her. Cixi saw an opportunity in 1902 on Prince Chun&#x27;s return from Germany – she ordered him to marry Youlan, the daughter of Ronglu, a conservative politician in the imperial court and a staunch supporter of Cixi. Prince Chun loathed Ronglu because the latter played a leading role in ending the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898, and in the subsequent internment of the Guangxu Emperor. However, he still agreed to marry Ronglu&#x27;s daughter because he felt it was unwise to oppose Cixi. The marriage between Prince Chun and Youlan was an unhappy one. With Prince Chun now firmly tied to her, Cixi no longer viewed him as a threat. When Prince Chun and Youlan&#x27;s first son, Puyi, was born in 1906, Puyi became a likely heir to the throne. Prince Chun and Youlan had another son, Pujie, and three daughters – Yunying, Yunhe and Yunying.

==Regency==
The Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908. On the same day, Empress Dowager Cixi issued an imperial edict proclaiming Prince Chun&#x27;s eldest son, Puyi, as the successor. Puyi was &quot;adopted&quot; as the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s son; like the Guangxu Emperor before him, he was no longer nominally his biological father&#x27;s son. Prince Chun was appointed Prince-Regent to assist the new emperor. Cixi died the following day, ending her 47-year-long control over China, while Prince Chun ruled as regent for the next three years. Prince Chun&#x27;s first concern was to punish the Beiyang Army general Yuan Shikai, who had betrayed the Guangxu Emperor and supported Ronglu in putting an end to the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898. Prince Chun was prevented from executing his plan of having Yuan Shikai assassinated, but managed to have Yuan dismissed from office and sent home to Henan on an excuse of &quot;curing his foot disease&quot;.
Over the next three years from 1909 to 1911, Prince Chun carried out the economic and political reforms that were initiated after the Boxer Rebellion ended in 1901, but he was torn between the conservative (mainly Manchu officials) and reformist (mostly Han Chinese officials) factions in the imperial court. The inexperienced Prince Chun concentrated more power in the hands of a small ruling court which angered bureaucrats on lower levels. He promised a constitution by 1916 with preparatory stages in between. Beginning on 5 February 1909, China held its first provincial assembly and local council elections (a council election was held in Tianjin as early as 1907). 21 provincial assemblies took their seats on 14 October. The vast majority elected were constitutional monarchists with a few crypto-revolutionaries and they turned the assemblies into hotbeds of dissent. Alarmed, the National Assembly, which convened in Beijing on 3 October 1910, had half of its 200 members appointed to balance the other half elected by the provincial assemblies. The provinces sent 98 members to the capital since Xinjiang, the 22nd province, had yet to hold elections to form an assembly due to its extreme underdevelopment. Prince Chun only appointed 96 members. Nevertheless, it was the elected members that dominated the floor and wooed the appointed ones to their side. The National Assembly urged Prince Chun to speed up the constitutional process and create a true parliament so the prince responded by pushing forth the expected deadline to 1913.

The Grand Council was replaced by an Imperial Cabinet led by Prince Qing on 8 May 1911. It dismayed constitutionalists as the Imperial Cabinet was not responsible to the National Assembly and contained seven Manchu imperial kinsmen with only four Han Chinese among its 13 members, breaking a long-standing policy of appointing equal numbers of both ethnicity. More power was concentrated in the hands of the Manchu minority than at any time since the dynasty&#x27;s early years. The following day, the government announced that it would nationalize major railroads, a policy which infuriated many businessmen who invested heavily in railways. They were told that they would be compensated with only a portion of the amount they invested. This alienated many bourgeois and gentry, who started the Railway Protection Movement as a means of opposition while themselves becoming disposed towards revolution.

The period saw the revolutionaries attempting several insurrections to overthrow the Qing dynasty, and there was even one attempt by Wang Jingwei to assassinate Prince Chun in February 1910. Prince Chun did not have the maneuvering talent nor the lust for power of Empress Dowager Cixi, and he proved often indecisive and probably unfit for this troubled period.

In 1910, Prince Chun ousted from Tibet the 13th Dalai Lama, who would not return from India until 1913, whereupon the Dalai Lama declared Tibet independent.

On 10 October 1911, the Wuchang Uprising marked the start of the Xinhai Revolution, which aimed to topple the Qing dynasty and end imperial rule in China. The Qing imperial court was forced to recall back Yuan Shikai, despite Prince Chun&#x27;s deep aversion for him, as Yuan was the only one capable of suppressing the revolution. Yuan became Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet on 16 November. Prince Chun, now deprived of any real power, stepped down on 6 December 1911, and was replaced by his sister-in-law, Empress Dowager Longyu, as regent. When he returned home that day, he told his family, &quot;Now I am back in the family, and I can finally care for my children&quot;. The three years of regency were certainly the most painful years in Prince Chun&#x27;s life; he never relished power the way Empress Dowager Cixi or Yuan Shikai did, and witnesses say he felt relieved when he left office.

Sir Reginald Johnston, tutor to Puyi, said that upon the Prince&#x27;s appointment as regent it was already common knowledge that he was incapable of the enormous task ahead of him. He states Chun was: 
==Life after the Qing dynasty==
Even after returning to private life, Prince Chun remained a respected figure, among both the Nationalist and later the Communist parties, who appreciated his peaceful stepping down from power and acceptance of China becoming a republic. Sun Yat-sen even visited him in Beijing in September 1912, during which he congratulated Prince Chun, and the latter formally declared his support for the Republic of China.

After the death of Empress Dowager Longyu in 1913, Prince Chun was put in charge of the small imperial court that remained around his son Puyi (no longer a ruling emperor), and he managed all the court&#x27;s affairs until 1924 when Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City. In 1917, when Puyi was briefly restored on the throne by the warlord Zhang Xun, Prince Chun played no significant role, as Zhang Xun&#x27;s slogan for the restoration was &quot;Do not allow the relatives of the emperor to participate in the government&quot;.

Prince Chun lived in the Northern Residence in Beijing until 1928. He spent most of his time in the library reading books on history and newly published magazines. Sometime after 1911, he married another wife, Lady Dengiya, with whom he had several children. His primary consort, Youlan, committed suicide in 1921 by swallowing opium after being publicly scolded by Dowager Consort Duankang (the highest-ranked woman in the imperial court after Empress Dowager Longyu&#x27;s death in 1913) for the misconduct of her son, Puyi.

In 1928, Prince Chun moved to Tianjin, where he lived in the British and Japanese concessions. In August 1939, he relocated back to the Northern Residence in Beijing when Tianjin was flooded. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Prince Chun was against the establishment of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, and warned Puyi not to be involved. However, Puyi ignored his advice and was installed by the Japanese as the puppet figurehead ruler of Manchukuo. Prince Chun visited his son thrice in Manchukuo but ostensibly refused to participate in state affairs. Puyi wanted his father to live in Manchukuo but his father refused and returned to Beijing on an excuse that he was ill. At the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, when the National Revolutionary Army recovered Beijing from the Japanese, a letter of sympathy was sent to Prince Chun by the Beijing Municipality in recognition of his attitude during the Japanese occupation.

After the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the Communist Party established the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Prince Chun was held in high regard by the party&#x27;s members. However, his son Puyi was arrested and imprisoned for ten years. Prince Chun sold the Northern Residence to the government out of financial difficulties. He also donated his library and art collection to Peking University, and provided relief aid to the victims of the Huai River flooding in 1950.

Prince Chun died on 3 February 1951 in Beijing. Many of his descendants have resided or reside in Beijing to this day, including Jin Youzhi, Jin Yuzhang and Jin Yulan. Many have changed their Manchu clan name Aisin Gioro to a Chinese family name Jin (金), which means &quot;gold&quot; (&quot;Aisin&quot; also means &quot;gold&quot; in Manchu).

<text>Laira – previously recorded as Lare (1591), Lary poynte (1638), the Leerie (1643), and the Lairy (1802) – was originally the name given to that part of the estuary of the River Plym from the Cattewater up to Marsh Mills in Plymouth, Devon, England. The name may derive from a Brythonic word corresponding to the Welsh &quot;llaeru&quot;, meaning &#x27;to ebb&#x27;.

The A379 road and the disused Plymouth to Yealmpton railway line cross the estuary just above the Plymouth suburb of Cattedown by two bridges both known as Laira Bridge.

The name Laira now also refers to the area of Plymouth surrounding the Laira Traction Maintenance Depot. Much of the housing here was built around 1900 for employees of the depot. There is a memorial plaque to the men of Laira who died in the Great War along Old Laira Road. Also situated on Old Laira Road is the old Police / Fire Station which is currently used as a library. Laira Green Primary school is situated in the area, as well as a disused United Reformed Church.

Until the beginning of the 19th century, Old Laira Road had constituted the northern shore of Lipson Lake (or Bay), an extensive tidal inlet on the western side of the estuary. This area – on which the railway depot and Lipson Co-operative Academy now stand – was reclaimed from the estuary and drained, together with Tothill Bay on the south side of higher ground at Mount Gould, upon the completion in 1802 of an embankment along the whole western shore of the Laira. A new road, laid along this embankment shortly afterwards, from Laira Green to Prince Rock, soon became the main highway into Plymouth from Plympton, Exeter, and beyond, avoiding the often steep and narrow way via Old Laira Road and Lipson – even though the new route was to remain a toll road until 1924.

<text>Ujar District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the centre of the country and belongs to the Central Aran Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Agdash, Goychay, Kurdamir, and Zardab. Its capital and largest city is Ujar. As of 2020, the district had a population of 89,500.

== History ==
The name Ucar derives from the Turkic word &quot;Ucqar&quot; meaning &quot;remote&quot;, as Ucar was remote from the Shirvanshah capital at Baku, and on the frontier of the Shirvan state.

Before, the territory of the Ujar region was part of the Shirvan Beylerbey, later Shamakhi khanate. On April 10, 1840, according to the administrative reform, it was the part of Caspian Province, and in 1846, joined the Shamakhi Governorate. After the Shamakhi earthquake in 1859, the centre of the Governorate moved to Baku. In December 1867, Goychay Uyezd was established in the territory of Baku province. At that time, the district was part of the Goychay Uyezd. In 1930, the Uyezd was abolished and the district was transferred to the administrative unit. Thus, the Ujar District was created on 24 January 1939 as an independent administrative unit from part of Goychay region. The territory of the region was changed in 1963. Thus, Zardab district was abolished in 1963 with its territory joined to the Ujar district. In 1965, the Zardab district was separated from Ucar when it was restored as an independent region.

== Population ==
, Ujar District had an estimated population of 77,900 people, of which 22% were urban dwellers and 78% rural. The population is 99.7% Azerbaijanis. According to the report of Statistical Committee of Republic, the total number of population in 2010 was 71.9 thousand people. By 2018, increased by 15,800 and reached 87.7.
== Rivers and water resources ==
Main rivers are the Goychay and Turyan (Garasu) rivers. Tikanlichay, one of the main rivers, starts from the south-western slope of the Bazarduzu mountain. The river has 10 branches. The Goychay River starts from the Lahij mountain system - the western slope of Kovdag (1980 m).

== Administration ==
There are 32 villages and 1 city in Ucar. The largest communities are Qazyan, Müsüslü and Qarabörk.

<text>Lipson is a ward in the city of Plymouth, England. It is an area with mixed terraced housing, some subdivided into bedsits and flats and a public open-space called &#x27;Freedom Fields&#x27;, a Civil War battle site where the townsfolk of nearby Plymouth resisted substantial Cavalier raiding parties and enabled the town to sustain the royalist siege. Freedom Fields existed before the Civil War and acquired its name after the defeat there of a French invasion force two hundred years earlier. The park was the inspiration behind the title of local folk singer-songwriter Seth Lakeman&#x27;s third album and currently has a small cafe, numerous benches and flower-beds.

Formerly the site of Plymouth&#x27;s biggest hospital (Freedom Fields Hospital), the borough prison, and fire and ambulance stations, it now retains only the (rebuilt) fire station.

Much of the housing stock consists of Victorian and Edwardian terraces with a few larger detached and semi-detached housing around the Queen&#x27;s Gate/ Queen&#x27;s Road area. Due in part to its proximity to the city&#x27;s university and the size of some of the older properties, some of the housing towards Greenbank has been subdivided into homes of multiple occupancy and flats. Social housing can be found to the north-east along Lipstone Crescent.

Because of its hilly position, much of the area offers panoramic views in most directions, not least south across Plymouth Sound. Plymouth&#x27;s main retail shopping centre, Plymouth University, and Plymouth Railway Station are all within reasonable walking distance. Shopping in Lipson is limited to a handful of takeaways and small grocery shops. Currently, as of 2021, there is a small Tesco outlet near Lipson Vale.

Lipson has a few schools, including Lipson Co-operative Academy.

Public transport is provided by Plymouth Citybus in the form of three bus routes. 8/9 and 20/21 via Lipson Vale and 23/24 via the Queens Road Triangle and the Mount Gould estate and hospital.

<doc id="1006209" wikidata="Q667409" url="?curid=1006209" title=".44 Special">
<text>The .44 Smith &amp; Wesson Special, also commonly known as .44 S&amp;W Special, .44 Special, .44 Spl, .44 Spc, or 10.9×29mmR, is a smokeless powder center fire metallic revolver cartridge developed by Smith &amp; Wesson in 1907 as the standard chambering for their New Century revolver, introduced in 1908.

==Development==
On the late 19th century American frontier, large .44- and .45-caliber cartridges were considered the epitome of handgun ammunition for self-protection, home defense, and hunting. Black-powder rounds such as the .44 American, .44 Russian, .44 Colt, .44-40 Winchester, .45 Schofield, and .45 Colt enjoyed a well-earned reputation for effective terminal ballistics, accuracy, and reliability.

At the start of the 20th century, Smith &amp; Wesson decided to celebrate by introducing a brand-new revolver design which they called the New Century.

Smith &amp; Wesson wished to pair their new revolver design with a worthy new ammunition chambering. At the time, smokeless powder was state of the art in ammunition technology. Older black-powder ammunition was in the process of being converted to smokeless. Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s popular .44 Russian cartridge had established a reputation for superb accuracy and was a renowned target load, and they decided to use an improved smokeless powder version as the basis for the new round. Due to the lower energy density of the early semi-smokeless powders, prior efforts to convert the .44 Russian to smokeless had produced less than stellar ballistic performance. Smith &amp; Wesson addressed this issue by lengthening the .44 Russian cartridge case by and increasing the powder capacity by . The resulting design, which S&amp;W called the .44 Special, had a case length of .

==Ballistics==
Unfortunately, the ballistics of the new cartridge merely duplicated the bullet at statistics of the .44 Russian, when the powder capacity of its case would have supported performance rivaling that of the .45 Colt and close to the .44-40. Nevertheless, the .44 Special retained its progenitor&#x27;s reputation for accuracy. The SAAMI maximum pressure standard for the .44 S&amp;W special is .
==The .44 Associates==

Almost from its introduction, firearms enthusiasts and cartridge handloaders saw that the potential of the .44 Special chambering was far from being realized and by the end of the 1920s were loading it to much higher velocities than factory standards. Led by articles in firearms periodicals penned by gun writers such as Elmer Keith and Skeeter Skelton, a loose cadre of enthusiastic fans who called themselves the &quot;.44 Associates&quot; formed. Trading information such as .44 Special handloading data and tips regarding the conversion of revolvers to .44 caliber, they promulgated the belief espoused by many firearms authorities and experts that the .44 Special chambering is one of the best overall in the handguns.

==Elmer Keith and his Magnums==
Elmer Keith, one of the most famous and popular firearms related authors at the time, developed a number of classical heavy handloads for the .44 Special; many are still highly regarded today. He also championed the concept of higher powered big-bore revolvers with Smith &amp; Wesson and Remington Arms, eventually leading to the development of the .357 Magnum, .41 Magnum, and .44 Magnum. Keith&#x27;s suggested designation for the proposed .44 caliber round was the &quot;.44 Special Magnum,&quot; but when Remington Arms developed the cartridge they chose to name it the .44 Remington Magnum. Nonetheless, the new cartridge was developed directly from the .44 Special design by simply lengthening the older case by .125 inch. Remington&#x27;s stated rationale for the making of this change was to preclude higher pressured Magnum loads from being chambered in .44 Special revolvers.

==Usage and loadings==
The hype and excitement surrounding the introduction of the .44 Magnum in the mid-1950s eclipsed the .44 Special, causing it to fall in popularity with firearms manufacturers. They offered fewer models chambered for .44 Special for several years. Recently the .44 Special has experienced something of a resurgence, since many firearms enthusiasts have realized that the heavy recoil of the Magnum round is &quot;too much pistol&quot; for many applications, and the heavier and more bulky revolvers chambered for it are not as convenient to carry. Another factor fueling the .44 Special&#x27;s comeback is its ability to fit in the longer chambers of the .44 Magnum revolvers, much like the .38 Special fits in the longer chambers of the .357 Magnum. This makes the .44 Special cartridge an attractive alternative for reduced velocity target shooting and plinking. The popularity of cowboy action shooting has also helped pique interest in the .44 Special, motivating manufacturers to offer modern and reproduction firearms chambered for this classic cartridge.

A variety of factory ammunition loadings are available in .44 Special, including bullet weights of at various velocities. Special high performance terminal ballistic loads are also offered, such as the Hornady JHP, Winchester Silvertip JHP, Speer Gold Dot JHP, Federal LHP, Cor-Bon JHP, and various other jacketed hollow point and soft point designs.

<text>Glen Phillips (born December 29, 1970) is an American songwriter, lyricist, singer and guitarist. He is the lead singer and songwriter of the alternative rock group Toad the Wet Sprocket and also records and performs as a solo artist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Phillips was born to a Reform Jewish family in Santa Barbara, California. His father was a college professor who taught physics. Although his family was Jewish, with Glen having a Bar Mitzvah, his family was secular and his father took him to meditation classes.

Phillips attended San Marcos High School, where he was a part of choir and theatre. He originally envisioned becoming a teacher. He began to make music at 14 years old. Phillips took the California High School Proficiency Exam so he could graduate early. 

===Career===
Phillips formed Toad the Wet Sprocket in 1986, at the age of 15, with friends from his high school.

In 1991, at age 20, Phillips wrote the song &quot;All I Want&quot;.

The band recorded five albums but broke up in 1998, after escalating tensions, shortly after Phillips&#x27; father died of colon cancer.

During his time in Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phillips was involved in a pop rock project called Flapping, Flapping, which released the album &quot;Montgomery Street&quot; in 1996.

In 2001, three years after the breakup of Toad, Phillips released his first solo album, &quot;Abulum&quot;. This was followed up by a self-released live album and solo touring, along with a reunion tour with his former Toad bandmates.

In 2004, Phillips released a collaboration with Nickel Creek, under the name Mutual Admiration Society. The self-titled album had been recorded in 2000 and featured songs written by both Phillips alone and as collaborative efforts, and was released on Sugar Hill Records.

In 2005, Phillips returned to a major label via Universal Music Group&#x27;s imprint Lost Highway Records and released the critically acclaimed &quot;Winter Pays For Summer&quot;. The album included the radio single &quot;Duck and Cover,&quot; but Phillips and the label parted ways due to creative differences. A compilation of six outtakes from the album were published as an EP titled &quot;Unlucky 7&quot;, the first track (&quot;The Hole&quot;) of which was featured in the second episode of the AMC television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

Phillips released his third proper solo album, &quot;Mr. Lemons&quot; in the spring of 2006.

In 2007, Phillips reunited with Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek as well as Grant-Lee Phillips and Luke Bulla to perform as part of The Various &amp; Sundry Tour.

In January 2008, Phillips released an EP &quot;Secrets of the New Explorers&quot;, with music influenced by Talk Talk and Peter Gabriel.

In January 2008, Phillips formed the supergroup Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.) featuring Phillips, Sean Watkins (guitar), his sister Sara Watkins (fiddle), Benmont Tench (piano), Luke Bulla (fiddle), Greg Leisz (various), Pete Thomas (drums), and Davey Faragher (bass). The group released an album in 2009.

In 2008, under the moniker Plover, Phillips recorded an album with Neilson Hubbard and Garrison Starr. 

In 2009, Phillips recorded a cover version of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Imagine That&quot;.

In April 2018, Phillips signed with Compass Records Group. His 2016 album, &quot;Swallowed By the New&quot;, was re-released on May 4, 2018, with a new bonus track &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Gonna Get Hurt&quot;.

==Personal life==
Phillips and his ex-wife, Laurel, whom he was married to from 1989 to 2014, have three daughters, Sophia, Freya, and Zola.

On October 8, 2008, Phillips injured his arm while at a friend&#x27;s house, where he was sitting on a glass coffee table that collapsed when he moved back. Phillips had surgery to repair a damaged ulnar nerve and muscle in his left arm. His ability to play guitar was hampered during his recovery, but he toured despite the injury.

Phillips has suffered from depression.

Phillips is known for performing barefoot.

<doc id="1006212" wikidata="Q580504" url="?curid=1006212" title="Out of Our Heads">
<text>Out of Our Heads is the third studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released in two editions with different covers and track listings. In the US, London Records released it on 30 July 1965 as the band&#x27;s fourth American album, while Decca Records released its UK edition on 24 September 1965 as the third British album.

Besides the key band members of singer Mick Jagger, guitarists Brian Jones and Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts, the album contains musical contributions from former Rolling Stones member Ian Stewart. It was produced by the group&#x27;s manager Andrew Loog Oldham.

As with the previous two albums, it consists mostly of covers of American blues, soul and rhythm and blues songs, though the group wrote some of their own material for this album (4 out of the 12 tracks on the UK version, and 6 out of 12 for the US version). The American version contains &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, which would be the band&#x27;s first number-one US hit, and would go on to top the charts in 10 other countries, including the band&#x27;s native UK; in 2004 it was ranked as the second greatest song of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; became the group&#x27;s first number one on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart; in the UK it charted at number two.

== Musical style ==
The majority of the songs were written and previously recorded by American rhythm and blues artists. According to music critic Richie Unterberger, the US edition largely had mid-1960s soul covers and &quot;classic rock singles&quot; written by the band, including &quot;The Last Time&quot;, &quot;Play with Fire&quot;, and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, that drew on the band&#x27;s R&amp;B and blues roots, but were updated to &quot;a more guitar-based, thoroughly contemporary context&quot;. Among the soul covers were Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, Solomon Burke&#x27;s &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, and Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot;. Kent H. Benjamin of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote that the album is &quot;the culmination of the Stones&#x27; early soul/R&amp;B sound&quot;. Writing of the UK edition, AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder characterised it as rock and roll and R&amp;B. The music critic Gary Mulholland writes that the UK version begins with a key proto-punk song – the band&#x27;s speedy cover of &quot;She Said Yeah&quot; – but otherwise, the majority of the album is &quot;a primitive template for what would later be tagged &#x27;blue-eyed soul&#x27;&quot;, also noting that &quot;That&#x27;s How Strong My Love Is&quot; is a sincere deep soul track.

== Release and reception ==

Initially issued in July 1965 in the US, &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; (featuring a shot from the same photo session that was used for the cover of &quot;12 X 5&quot; and &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot;) contained recordings made over a six-month period, including the top-10 hit &quot;The Last Time&quot; and the worldwide number one &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; with B-sides as well as a track from the UK-only live EP &quot;Got Live If You Want It!&quot;. Six songs from it would be included on the UK version of the album. &quot;One More Try&quot; is an original that was not released in the UK until 1971&#x27;s &quot;Stone Age&quot;. Riding the wave of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;&#x27;s success, &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; became the Rolling Stones&#x27; first US number one album, eventually going platinum.

The British &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; – with a different cover – added songs that would surface later in the US on &quot;December&#x27;s Children (And Everybody&#x27;s)&quot;, and others that had not been released in the UK thus far (such as &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;), instead of the previously released live track and recent hit singles (as singles rarely featured on albums in the UK in those times). Issued that September, &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; reached number two on the UK chart behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot;. It was the Rolling Stones&#x27; last UK album to rely upon rhythm and blues covers; the forthcoming &quot;Aftermath&quot; was entirely composed by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.

The US edition of the album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2003, this edition was also listed at number 114 on the list of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then was re-ranked at number 116 in the 2012 revised list.

Garry Mulholland, writing retrospectively in &quot;Uncut&quot;, poses that the UK version of &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; coheres as an album better than the US version, despite both versions being &quot;cynical [hotchpotches] of recordings from the previous six months.&quot; He wrote of the UK version: &quot;The covers of recent American deep soul classics that dominate showcase the band&#x27;s sincere love of black balladry and dance music, while the four originals point the way, hesitantly, towards the stunning pop-art group who would soon emerge on &quot;Aftermath&quot;.&quot;

In August 2002 both the US and UK editions of &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; were reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.

<doc id="1006214" wikidata="Q1190414" url="?curid=1006214" title="Remoulade">
<text>Rémoulade (; ) is a cold sauce. Although similar to tartar sauce, it is often more yellowish, sometimes flavored with curry, and often contains chopped pickles or piccalilli. It can also contain horseradish, paprika, anchovies, capers and a host of other items.

It is often used as a condiment or dipping sauce, primarily for sole, plaice, and seafood cakes (such as crab or salmon cakes) but also served with meats.

== Use ==
Rémoulade is originally from France, but can now be found throughout Europe and in the United States, specifically in Louisiana Creole cuisine. It is often used with French fries, on top of roast beef items, and as a hot dog condiment, although there are many other applications around the world.

=== France ===
The sauce is made from mayonnaise with vinegar, mustard, shallots, capers, chopped pickles, and/or fresh herbs (chives, tarragon, chervil, burnet). It is commonly served as &quot;céleri remoulade&quot;, a mustard-flavored remoulade variation with shredded raw celeriac. Often it is served as a condiment for red meats, fish, and shellfish.

===Belgium=== 
Rémoulade is often served with fries, such as those sold at roadside stands.

===Denmark=== 
In Denmark, it is an essential ingredient on open-face roast beef sandwiches (&quot;smørrebrød&quot;), as well as the Danish version of fish and chips, fried plaice with fries. It is used on spring rolls, including soy sauce and ketchup. It is used with lemon (juice) on canned pressed cod roe on rye bread. It is also one of the essential condiments in a Danish hot dog. Danish remoulade is a modified version of the original French-style remoulade. It is a mayonnaise-based sauce, coloured brightly yellow with turmeric (or a pinch of curry powder), mixed with a purée of capers and pickled gherkins or cucumbers, and sometimes cauliflower, cabbage and carrots.

===Germany===
It is mainly used with fried fish, roast beef, or &quot;Sülze&quot;, as an ingredient of potato salads, or as a boiled egg garnish (similar to deviled eggs). In the southern half of the country, it is served with boiled beef and potatoes.

===Sweden===
&quot;Remouladsås&quot; or &quot;remoulade&quot; is a common condiment for fried or breaded fish dishes, also used as a topping on roast beef.

The Danish version is also available and is used on a variety of dishes referred to as &#x27;Danish-style&#x27;, for example Danish hot dogs and Danish smørrebrød.

===Norway===
Primarily served with deep-fried fish or on open-faced sandwiches.

===Poland===
Called &quot;remulada&quot;, or rarely &quot;sos duński&quot; (Danish sauce), it is a very popular condiment for fast food, such as hot dogs, hamburgers, or zapiekanka.

===Iceland===
&quot;Remúlaði&quot; is a condiment commonly served with fried fish and on hot dogs, together with mustard, ketchup, and raw and fried onions.

===United States===
Remoulade is typically served as a condiment with seafood and certain vegetables. Fried soft-shell crab sandwiches may be served with remoulade as the only sauce.

It is also very commonly used as a condiment for sandwiches, especially turkey. Remoulade is most commonly paired with white cheese. It may be offered as a fry sauce as well.

In Louisiana Creole cuisine, remoulade tends to have a tannish or pink tint due to the use of Creole mustard, small amounts of ketchup, cayenne pepper, and paprika.

==Varieties==

===Sauce rémoulade===
In French cuisine, rémoulade is a derivative of the mayonnaise sauce, with the addition of mixed herbs (parsley, chives, chervil and tarragon), capers, diced cornichons and, optionally, some anchovy essence or chopped anchovies.

The rémoulade used in céleri-rave rémoulade is different: it is based on a simple mustard-flavoured vinegar and oil dressing spiced with salt, pepper, and chopped green herbs.

===Danish remoulade===

Danish remoulade condiment has a mild, sweet-sour taste and a medium yellow color. The typical industrially-made variety does not contain capers, but finely-chopped cabbage and pickled cucumber, fair amounts of sugar, and a touch of curry powder (mustard seeds, cayenne pepper, coriander, onion powder, and turmeric) mostly for color. The fresh herbs are replaced by herbal essences, e.g., tarragon vinegar. Starch, gelatin or milk protein may be added as thickeners.

Homemade or gourmet varieties may use olive oil (especially good with fish), capers, pickles, carrots, cucumber, lemon juice, dill, chervil, parsley or other fresh herbs, and possibly curry powder of various contents.

In Denmark, remoulade is mostly used for french fries, hotdogs, spring rolls and for open sandwiches with roast beef, salami, fish cakes or fried fish.

===Louisiana remoulade===

Louisiana remoulade can vary from the French-African Creole, the rustic Afro-Caribbean Creole, or the Classic Cajun version, and like the local variants of roux, each version is different from the French original.

Creole versions often have tan or pink hues and are usually piquant.

Louisiana-style remoulades fall generally into one of two categories—those with a mayonnaise base and those with an oil base, but sometimes both mayonnaise and oil are used.

Each version may have finely chopped vegetables, usually green onions and celery, and parsley; most are made with either Creole or stone-ground mustard. Salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper are also standard ingredients.

In the oil- and mayonnaise-based versions, the reddish hue often comes from the addition of a small amount of ketchup and/or paprika.

The sauce is often topped with paprika for the aesthetics as well as the flavor. Generally, lemon juice or vinegar are added for acidity. Other additions include hardboiled egg or raw egg yolks, minced garlic, hot sauce, vinegar, horseradish, capers, cornichons, and Worcestershire sauce.

While the classic white remoulade is a condiment that can be offered in a variety of contexts (e.g., the classic celery root remoulade), Creole remoulade is used on shrimp, crabs, fried calamari, artichokes, and fried green tomatoes among other foods.

Today, shrimp remoulade is a very common cold appetizer in New Orleans Creole restaurants, although, historically, hard-boiled eggs with remoulade was a less expensive option on some menus.

Shrimp remoulade is most often served as a stand-alone appetizer (usually on a chiffonade of iceberg lettuce). One might also see crawfish remoulade, but restaurants seldom offer remoulade sauce as an accompaniment with fish, where cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are generally preferred. However, food columnist and cookbook author Leon Soniat does suggest to &quot;Serve [remoulade] over seafood or with sliced asparagus.&quot;

Central Mississippi has comeback sauce, a condiment that is very similar to Louisiana remoulade.

<text>United Netherlands (UNL) is an educational student-led organization that focuses on the theory and practice of international relations and diplomacy. It is based at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

UNL organizes various student activities related to personal development, including its Public Speaking Program, High School Program. Furthermore, it offers the accredited United Nationds and Multilateral Diplomacy: Theory and Practice (UNMD) course, and its corresponding Delegation to Oxford University and Harvard University.

In the past, UNL has organized various student activities related to the United Nations, including the Radboud international Model United Nations (RiMUN), the Month of the United Nations (MotUN), and WorldMUN 2009. 

==History==
In 2003 two students from the Netherlands, David Vermijs and Tjeerd Tim, organized the first ever Dutch delegation to participate in the Harvard National Model United Nations (HNMUN) at Harvard University in the United States of America. After attending this international event it was agreed that students in the Netherlands would benefit from an organized preparatory track. The second Dutch delegation in 2004 was the first to receive lectures in international law, economics, politics, United Nations rules of procedure and public speaking trainings. The United Netherlands organization was officially founded in 2004 during the aforementioned events.

Due to strong interest in the United Netherlands Delegation it was decided to broaden the scope of the activities by organizing additional events, open to all students. Among the first events to take place where a symposium in 2005 and the first Model United Nations ever organized in Nijmegen in 2006: the Radboud intra-university Model United Nations (later renamed to Radboud international Model United Nations). Furthermore, the preparatory track for HNMUN was intensified and more attention was given to team-building, paper writing, debating and negotiation. The following year the 2005 - 2006 Delegation came back from HNMUN with eight individual awards and the &quot;Best International Delegation&quot; award, a feat no European delegation had been able to accomplish in at least five years.

===2006 - 2007===
During OxIMUN 2006 (taking place at Oxford University) awards were won in 7 out of 8 committees. Following this success, in 2007 the United Netherlands Delegation to HNMUN won both the prizes for &quot;Best Large Delegation&quot; and &quot;Best International Delegation&quot;, succeeding in something no other European delegation had achieved in the history of the conference. Furthermore, delegates received 22 individual awards.

In the same year two new United Netherlands activities were launched: the Month of the UN, a month-long preparatory course for RiMUN, and a pilot version of the United Netherlands High School Program (HSP), a programme specifically designed for high school students. Four high schools participated in the very first edition of the High School Program.

Furthermore, the United Netherlands alumni association A&quot;MUN&quot;li was brought into existence and an agreement on structural cooperation was reached between United Netherlands and the Radboud University Nijmegen. With over 250 students participating and 22 nationalities attending, both RiMUN conferences organized during 2006 and 2007 were a success. The following year it was decided to reduce the number of RiMUN conferences to one per academic year.

===2007 - 2008===
The &quot;United Nations and Multilateral Diplomacy&quot; course was continued and successfully concluded with the &quot;Outstanding Delegation&quot; award at HNMUN 2008. The United Netherlands Delegation had been chosen to represent France during the conference.

The RiMUN conference took place in April 2008 and grew in participant numbers to over two hundred. The affiliated MotUN program had its third and fourth edition in November 2007 and April 2008, the latter preceding the RiMUN conference. The High School Program witnessed its second pilot year to ready it for professional implementation in the consecutive year.

Finally, the United Netherlands board of 2007-2008 succeeded in winning the bid to host the Harvard World Model United Nations conference in The Hague in 2009.

===2009 - 2010===
Despite increasing competition at OxiMUN and HNMUN the United Netherlands Delegation continues to be a successful one. After having won several individual awards at OxiMUN 2009, the United Netherlands Delegation (representing Russia) succeeded in winning the Best International Delegation at HNMUN 2010 for the fourth time.

Participation in the small-scaled MotUN program doubled, now reaching approximately forty participants. After a one-year break due to WorldMUN 2009 the Radboud international Model United Nations was organized again and concluded in April 2010, its success featured both on television and newspaper.

The High School Program witnessed a shift in orientation, broadening its scope from Dutch high schools to schools outside of the Netherlands too. In April 2010, four participating schools successfully participated in the special HSP MUN closing the High School Program.

===2018 - 2019===
At OxIMUN, the 16th Delegation of United Netherlands managed to win the &#x27;Best Large Delegation Award&#x27;. Additionally, 22 individual delegates have been recognized for their outstanding performance.

==Organizational structure==
The United Netherlands Foundation is led by the Board, including a President, a financial manager, an event manager, a relations manager, a commercial manager, an academic manager and a program manager. The members of the Board work together closely on organizational matters, training the delegation and on long-term projects. The Board is in charge of organizing all the three programs of United Netherlands: the Delegation, the High School Program and the Public Speaking Program. Altogether these teams form the essence of the United Netherlands organization.
Several external Boards are concerned with the overall development and management of all of the active components within the United Netherlands framework. The Board communicates with the Supervisory Board, which is in charge of formally assisting United Netherlands in its general development now and in the future. Furthermore, an Advisory Board has been put in place to provide support and insight if necessary. Finally, United Netherlands is officially supported by its Board of Recommendation, formed by respected members Dries van Agt, Thom de Graaf, Caecilia van Peski, Diederik Laman Trip, Boris Dittrich, Pieter Feith and former Rector magnificus of the Radboud University Cees Blom and Bas Kortmann.

==The United Nations and Multilateral Diplomacy (UNMD) course==
The UNMD course concept, generally considered to lie at the origin of United Netherlands, has been designed to teach both the theory and practice of international relations and diplomacy to talented students. The theoretical part of the course lasts half a year and involves lectures on international matters by renowned speakers, intensive training in public speaking, lobbying and negotiation, and a final training week in New York. The practical aspect of the course is embodied by participation in the Oxford international Model United Nations (OxIMUN), and ultimately the Harvard National Model United Nations in Boston, considered to be the oldest, largest and arguably most respected Model United Nations conference in the world.

Approximately thirty students can participate in the course every year. Participants are drawn through a selection process which consists of three rounds and takes place twice a year. 

The preparation track, the training week and MUN conferences together form the United Nations and Multilateral Diplomacy: Theory and Practice course. The course is equivalent to a (Dutch) BA3 course and is academically accredited with 10 ECTS through the Radboud University. Participants are trained, coached and given feedback by two Head Delegates and MUN Trainer carrying the responsibility for the Delegation.

==Radboud international Model United Nations (RiMUN)==
RiMUN is a Model United Nations Conference hosted by United Netherlands. The first edition was organized in December 2005 in Nijmegen, then named Radboud intrauniversity Model United Nations. 26 different countries were represented. The theme of the conference was &#x27;Freedom vs Liberty - in an international perspective&#x27;.

In April 2006 the second edition took place in Nijmegen. This time called Radboud international Model United Nations, participation was open to students from all Dutch universities and abroad. This edition was centered on the theme of the Millennium Development Goals. Speakers in this edition were Mandeep Bains, Ruud Lubbers and Dries van Agt.

From November 24 to November 26, 2006, the next RiMUN took place. The theme was &#x27;War on War - Peace and Security in the 21st century&#x27;. Speakers were, among others, Pieter Kooijmans, C. F. Meindersma and Maarten van Rossem.

RiMUN 2007 was centered on the theme Fight 4 Freedoms: Roosevelt&#x27;s 1941 State of the Union revisited. Delegates re-enacted the League of Nations, discussed the limits to freedom of religion in a symposium and discussed female circumcision.

At RiMUN 2008, United Netherlands hosted Jan Pronk and Thom de Graaf.

In 2009, United Netherlands was allowed to host the 2009 WorldMUN conference. Therefore, in 2009 no RiMUN was organized, as United Netherlands cooperated with Harvard University to host WorldMUN 2009 in The Hague.

In April 2010, RiMUN 2010 was organized, based around the theme Times of Trial, in order to discuss global challenges the world faces in the 21st century. Keynote speakers included Dries van Agt and Thom de Graaf.

RiMUN 2011 took place from April 15–17, 2011 and centered on the theme Shifting Balances. Participants from over 25 different universities and coming from over 12 different countries, discussed the issues surrounding shifting global power relations, and the changing standards towards warfare, human rights violations and the environment. Other themes were rising tensions at the Korean Peninsula, the global consumption of oil, nationalist terrorism, child trafficking and the completion of the European Union.

<doc id="1006227" wikidata="Q5571864" url="?curid=1006227" title="Glossary of sculpting">
<text>This page describe terms and jargon related to sculpture and sculpting.


==A==

=== armature ===

:An armature is an internal frame or skeleton which supports a modelled sculpture. A typical armature for a small sculpture is made of heavy gauge wire, bent and twisted to form the basic shape. Often the armature is designed to leave one or more pins protruding from the base of the finished sculpture to facilitate attaching it to the plinth

=== additive ===
: Is the process by which material is shaped and built up, frequently on an armature, to create the desired image. Traditionally the material used in modeling clay, but plaster is considered a less desirable but also less expensive substitute. Frequently the sculpture created by the additive method is a temporary one, used to create a more permanent version in stone or bronze.

=== assemblage ===
:An assemblage is a sculpture constructed from found objects. Typically an assemblage does not disguise the original objects used, rather it either tries to show them in a new light, or forms a figurative sculpture from the collection of shapes.

== B ==

=== bozzetto ===
:(Italian) A small terracotta sketch of a sculpture: see &quot;maquette&quot;.

== C ==

=== carving ===
:Carving is one of the oldest sculptural techniques. It is a subtractive process; starting with a solid block, the sculptor removes material using chisels and other tools to &#x27;reveal&#x27; the finished form. Traditional carving materials include stone, especially marble, and fine grained woods.

=== casting ===

: Casting is a method of producing one or more copies of a sculpture. Typically, the original sculpture is modeled as usual and covered with a molding material that sets hard when dry. The mold is then separated to release the original sculpture. Once the mold is reassembled, at its most simple the casting material is poured into the void and left to set. Traditionally, molten bronze is used as the casting material, but modern alternatives include resin. When the cast sculpture has cooled or cured, the mold is again separated to release it and reassembled ready to cast the next copy. When molten bronze is used, it is more typical to use a lost wax or similar process so that the finished piece is hollow rather than solid.
: The cast sculpture may then require some finishing work to remove mold lines and other imperfections. The sculptor may also wish to patinate the work to produce the final piece...

=== Ciment Fondu ===
:Ciment Fondu is a proprietary product made by Kerneos (previously Lafarge Aluminates) for industrial use but widely adopted by sculptors. It is a type of calcium aluminate cement used for constructing moulds or outdoor works. Typically Ciment Fondu needs to be used as a composite material reinforced with fibre glass, building up the mould in series of layers. Fast setting, it achieves its full strength in 24 hours.

=== cold cast bronze ===
:A modern method of casting sculptures in which the casting material is a resin mixed with powdered bronze. The finished sculpture has a surface which looks very similar to a traditionally cast bronze although it tends to be much lighter.

== D ==

=== direct carving ===
:Also referred to as &quot;taille directe&quot;. A less planned approach to carving in which the sculptor carves the finished sculpture without using intermediate models or maquettes. The sculptor typically works from memory, though some such as Cornelia Van Auken Chapin would carve with a model in front of them. The practice gained prominence in the early 20th century and, in some respects, was seen as a return to the direct approach used in primitive art.

== H ==

=== Hydrocal ===

:Hydrocal is a US Gypsum product composed mainly of plaster of Paris and a small amount of Portland cement. Hydrocal, like its similar formulas Hydrostone, Ultracal, Duracal and others are all used for casting sculptures and other art objects as well as molds. Considerably harder and stronger than straight plaster of Paris, these products are for indoor use only as they rapidly degrade in the rain.

==I==

===indirect===
:Indirect carving &quot;involves the use of previously prepared three dimensional models . . . . usually assigned to a professional carver who, with the assistance of a pointing machine, proceeds to duplicate the model in stone. During the latter half of the nineteenth century and extending into the first part of the twentieth virtually all stone sculpture was produced by the indirect method of carving.&quot;

== K ==

=== kinetic sculpture ===
:Kinetic sculpture is sculpture which is designed to move. The movement can be driven by interaction with the viewer, or automatically using motors or air currents, as in the case of a mobile.

== M ==
=== maquette ===

: A maquette is a small-scale model for a finished sculpture. It is used to visualize and test shapes and ideas without incurring the cost and effort of producing a full-scale sculpture. It is the analogue of the painter&#x27;s cartoon or sketch.
: For commissioned sculptures, especially monumental public sculptures, a maquette may be used to show the client how the finished work will fit in the proposed site.
=== modeling ===

: Modeling is one of the most common techniques for sculpting. It is an additive process in which material is steadily built up to produce the finished figure. Unlike carving, the sculptor often also has the option of correcting mistakes by removing or reshaping the material. Modeling requires a malleable or plastic material which is later cured or fired to set it hard. Typical modeling materials include clay, wax, plaster, and papier-mâché.
: Frequently the modeling material has limited structural strength and will need the support of an armature.

=== mould ===
:A mould is a reversed impression of a sculpture which is used to cast replica sculptures. The material used to construct the mould needs to accurately reproduce the surface detail of the original sculpture, while also being strong enough to keep its shape during casting and resilient enough to retain detail after multiple castings.
:Typical moulding materials include rubber, especially latex rubber, plaster and composites such as &quot;ciment fondu&quot;.

== P ==

=== papier-mâché ===
:(often misspelled as )
:Papier-mâché is a construction material that consists of pieces of paper, sometimes reinforced with textiles, stuck together using a wet paste (e.g. glue, starch, or wallpaper adhesive). The crafted object becomes solid when the paste dries.

===patina===
 (also patinate, patination)
:A patina is a natural or applied surface finish to a sculpture piece. Natural patinas may occur by oxidation due to long exposure to air or earth — the most common of which is verdigris on copper or bronze. Artificial patinas can be created by application of chemical pastes or (below melting point) firing in a chemical atmosphere.

=== plasticene ===
:Plasticene is an oil-based clay used for modelling sculptures; its chief advantages over water clay is it does not shrink, crack or dry out and can be worked on over a long period of time.

=== plaster cast ===
:A plaster cast is a copy of a sculpture, which is cast in plaster. A plaster cast can accurately reproduce the details of the original sculpture, but is usually much less durable. It is often used as a stage in the casting process.

=== pointing machine ===
:A pointing machine is used to accurately transfer measuring points from a model or maquette into stone or wood, in order to carve an accurate copy. This is called the indirect method of carving.

==R==

===roughing out===
:The process of carving out the basic shapes of a work before any detail is created.

== S ==

=== sand casting ===
:A method of casting typically used for casting iron, in which the mould is constructed from compacted sand. By its nature, the mould can only be used once and needs to be reformed for each casting

== T ==

===Taille directe===
:See Direct carving

=== truth to materials ===
:A process or mode in direct carving in which the sculptor responds to the nature of the block being carved as much as the subject. Changes in colouration and imperfections revealed while carving the block are incorporated as features in the finished sculpture. Since the sculptor doesn&#x27;t know in advance what imperfections will be revealed during the course of carving, a more flexible and fluid approach is required.

<doc id="1006240" wikidata="Q7643750" url="?curid=1006240" title="Supermac's">
<text>Supermac&#x27;s is an Irish fast food restaurant chain that first opened in 1978. The first restaurant was located in Ballinasloe, County Galway, in Ireland. As of 2019, the chain consists of a total of 118 restaurants spread throughout the island of Ireland. It operates a number of franchise outlets with many also privately owned. Supermac&#x27;s serves an average of 320,000 customers per week and had annual revenues of €79.9 million and a profit of €7.4 million according to its 2013 closing report.

Its head office is in the Ballybrit Business Park in Ballybrit, County Galway.

==History==
The first restaurant was opened in Ballinasloe, County Galway, in the West of Ireland in 1978, by Pat and Una McDonagh. A second restaurant opened two years later in Gort, followed by an Eyre Square premises in Galway city which opened in 1982.

, Supermac&#x27;s was the largest Irish-owned quick service food chain, with over 100 outlets across Ireland. In June 2014, Supermac&#x27;s opened its 100th store in the Barack Obama Plaza on the M7 Motorway. Supermac&#x27;s also exclusively operates the Papa Johns brand in the island of Ireland as well as SuperSubs, which replaces the Quiznos franchise that Supermac&#x27;s formerly held. The company employed over 4,000 people as of 2020.

==Corporate overview==
===Name===
The Restaurant was named together by locals and its owners: The founder, Pat McDonagh, earned the nickname &#x27;Supermac&#x27; whilst playing Gaelic football for the Carmelite College in Moate. This then became the choice of name for his business, &quot;Supermac&#x27;s&quot;.

===Operations===
Through Supermac&#x27;s Ireland Ltd, Pat and Una McDonagh also own Claddagh Irish Pubs &amp; Restaurants, a chain of eleven Irish-themed bars and restaurants operating in eight Midwestern states in the United States.

Supermac&#x27;s is Ireland&#x27;s largest indigenous quick service restaurant group. Supermac&#x27;s Holdings Ltd. has applied to trademark the Supermac&#x27;s name in both Europe and Australia with McDonagh stating, in 2015, that he was planning on &quot;responding to demands coming from fifteen cities internationally for the opening of Supermac&#x27;s restaurants&quot;.

In 2013, the company expanded its motor services business by developing the Tipperary Town Plaza and Mallow N20 Plaza on national primary routes. The company opened another plaza in Kiltullagh, County Galway at the M6 Loughrea Junction in February 2016.

===Hotels===
The company has also expanded its hospitality business interests through the purchase and development of the Castletroy Park Hotel, Limerick, Loughrea Hotel &amp; Spa, Galway, Charleville Park Hotel, Cork, The Killeshin Hotel, Portlaoise, Castle Oaks House Hotel, Limerick and Athlone Springs Hotel, Monksland

== Advertising ==
Supermac&#x27;s initiated the &quot;Bring them Home&quot; campaign where they reunited families, whose relatives were living around the world, for Christmas. Between 2012 and 2013 Supermac&#x27;s flew 43 people who had emigrated from Ireland during the economic recession to locations worldwide back to Ireland to be with their families and friends over the festive season. The campaign was promoted on 2FM&#x27;s &quot;Tubridy Show&quot; and through RTÉ One&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, where the winners surprised their families by being reunited live on air during Christmas week. In 2014, Supermac&#x27;s campaign appeared in Times Square (7th Avenue) in New York City.

In 2012, the chain was included in a list of &quot;10 fast-food restaurants you haven&#x27;t heard of&quot; by the &quot;Daily Meal&quot; programme on Fox News, while &quot;USA Today&quot; included Supermac&#x27;s in a list of &quot;Top Foreign Chains we want to move Stateside&quot; in 2013.

===Sponsorship===

Supermac&#x27;s sponsors a number of sporting organisations. As of 2018, the company&#x27;s association with Galway hurling was the longest running inter-county GAA sponsorship in the country, then in its twenty eighth year. In 2013, a deal was signed seeing both hurling and football in Galway sponsored by one organisation for the first time. The deal included sponsorship of Galway football and hurling across all age groups from under age through to senior. As of 2013, Supermac&#x27;s had provided over €2 million to Galway&#x27;s GAA county board.

The company also engages with other sports sponsorships such as rugby, soccer, international rules football (2005) and horseracing (Limerick, Ballinrobe races).

Other Supermac&#x27;s sponsorships include &quot;The Ray Foley Show&quot; on Today FM from 2010 to 2012, and &quot;The Will Leahy Show&quot; on RTÉ 2fm from 2012 to 2014.

The restaurant chain also sponsored the Volvo Ocean Race 2009 and 2012 during the Galway leg of the race. Supermac&#x27;s was also a sponsor of Cannonball Ireland in 2012 and 2014.

==EU trademarks case==
In 2017, McDonald&#x27;s objected to Supermac&#x27;s registering its name and certain of its product names as trademarks throughout the European Union for the purpose of expanding outside of Ireland. McDonald&#x27;s argued that the Supermac&#x27;s name is visually similar to McDonald&#x27;s, while Supermac&#x27;s argued that it has traded alongside McDonald&#x27;s in Ireland since 1978 without confusion. McDonald&#x27;s won a partial victory, with the EU&#x27;s Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) ruling that Supermac&#x27;s could trade under its own name in the EU, but it rejected Supermac&#x27;s trademark applications for several items, including menu items. It said that consumers could &quot;be confused as to whether Supermac&#x27;s is a new version of McDonald&#x27;s&quot;, given the almost identical products sold by both chains.

Supermac&#x27;s, in turn, challenged McDonald&#x27;s right to hold certain trademarks registered by it in the EU. In January 2019, the EUIPO ruled that certain trademarks owned by McDonald&#x27;s, including Big Mac, were to be revoked. In 2023, the EUIPO Board of Appeals partially reversed the decision revoking McDonald&#x27;s trademarks, permitting McDonald&#x27;s to continue to use the trademark for poultry products and restaurants, but also permitting Supermac&#x27;s to use the Big Mac name on its own food products.

Supermac&#x27;s appealed the EUIPO&#x27;s decision to the European Court of Justice. On 5 June 2024, the court held that McDonald&#x27;s had failed to prove use of the Big Mac trademark in relation to chicken products or in relation to services associated with operating restaurants, meaning Supermac&#x27;s and other businesses are now free to use the &quot;Mac&quot; in their business names and in names for poultry products in Europe. McDonald&#x27;s retains the Big Mac trademark for its beef burgers only.

==Charity==
Supermac&#x27;s has donated money to charities such as Trócaire and to local charities including Alan Kerrins African Projects. It has also hosted charity events in its outlets such as Today FM&#x27;s Shave or Dye.

<text>Phosphorus () is the god of the planet Venus in its appearance as the Morning Star. Another Greek name for the Morning Star is &quot;Eosphorus&quot; (), which means &quot;dawn-bringer&quot;. The term &quot;eosphorus&quot; is sometimes met in English. As an adjective, the word &quot;phosphorus&quot; is applied in the sense of &quot;light-bringing&quot; (for instance, the dawn, the god Dionysus, pine torches and the day) and &quot;torch-bearing&quot; as an epithet of several gods and goddesses, especially of Hecate but also of Artemis/Diana and Hephaestus. Seasonally, Venus is the &quot;light bringer&quot; in the northern hemisphere, appearing most brightly in December (an optical illusion due to shorter days), signalling the &quot;rebirth&quot; of longer days as winter wanes.

==Venus==

The morning star is an appearance of the planet Venus, an inferior planet, meaning that its orbit lies between the Earth and the Sun. Depending on the orbital locations of both Venus and Earth, it can be seen in the eastern morning sky for an hour or so before the Sun rises and dims it, or (as the evening star) in the western evening sky for an hour or so after the Sun sets, when Venus itself then sets. 
Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon, outshining the planets Jupiter and Saturn but, while these rise high in the sky, Venus never does. This may lie behind myths about deities associated with the morning star proudly striving for the highest place among the gods and being cast down.


==Mythology==

In Greek mythology, Hesiod calls Phosphorus a son of Astraeus and Eos, but other say of Cephalus and Eos, or of Atlas.

The Latin poet Ovid, speaking of Phosphorus and Hesperus (the Evening Star, the evening appearance of the planet Venus) as identical, makes him the father of Daedalion. Ovid also makes him the father of Ceyx, while the Latin grammarian Servius makes him the father of the Hesperides or of Hesperis.

While at an early stage the Morning Star (called Phosphorus and other names) and the Evening Star (referred to by names such as Hesperus) were thought of as two celestial objects, the Greeks accepted that the two were the same, but they seem to have continued to treat the two mythological entities as distinct. Halbertal and Margalit interpret this as indicating that they did not identify the star with the god or gods of mythology &quot;embodied&quot; in the star.

== &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; ==

In the philosophy of language, &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; is a famous sentence in relation to the semantics of proper names. Gottlob Frege used the terms &quot;the evening star&quot; (&quot;der Abendstern&quot;) and &quot;the morning star&quot; (&quot;der Morgenstern&quot;) to illustrate his distinction between sense and reference, and subsequent philosophers changed the example to &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; so that it utilized proper names. Saul Kripke used the sentence to posit that the knowledge of something necessary — in this case the identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus — could be discoverable rather than known &quot;a priori&quot;.

==Latin literature==
The Latin word corresponding to Greek &quot;Phosphorus&quot; is &quot;Lucifer&quot;. It is used in its astronomical sense both in prose and poetry. Poets sometimes personify the star, placing it in a mythological context.

<doc id="1006264" wikidata="Q3575331" url="?curid=1006264" title="Zeus Web Server">
<text>Zeus Web Server is a discontinued proprietary high-performance web server for Unix and Unix-like platforms (including Solaris, FreeBSD, HP-UX and Linux). It was developed by Zeus Technology, a software company located in Cambridge, England that was founded in 1995 by University of Cambridge graduates Damian Reeves and Adam Twiss.

== History ==
Zeus was designed to be a high-performance web server since the beginning of its development in 1995. Until the first decade of the 2000s, it was known as one of the fastest and most scalable web servers available on market. 

Despite its excellent performance, it never gained more than a few percentage points (less than 3%) in the global usage of most popular web servers. However, it was commonly used by hardware vendors submitting SPECweb99 benchmarks for their hardware. The SPECweb99 benchmark was retired in 2005 and replaced by SPECweb2005. While some SPECweb2005 submissions were made using Zeus, by 2008 it was no longer used by the top computer hardware performers.

Support for AIX, Tru64, and Mac OS X was dropped on 10 June 2008. No new Zeus releases have been made since January 2010, and the company no longer offers a similar server solution. In July 2011, the company was acquired by Riverbed Technology, who ended support for Zeus on November 30, 2014.

== Features ==
In addition to static content serving, Zeus supported dynamic content via CGI, FastCGI, Apache JServ, ISAPI, NSAPI, mod_perl, SSI and Zeus Distributed Authentication and Content (ZDAC), a proprietary FastCGI-like protocol. While Zeus mainly competed with other commercial web servers such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server, it also included a high degree of compatibility with Apache HTTP Server (including .htaccess support and a URL rewriting system comparable to Apache&#x27;s codice_1), with the expectation that Apache users would migrate to Zeus as their server load increased. NSAPI and ISAPI were added to ease migrations from Microsoft IIS and Sun Java System Web Server.

<doc id="1006266" wikidata="Q3325510" url="?curid=1006266" title="Plaster cast">
<text>A plaster cast is a copy made in plaster of another 3-dimensional form. The original from which the cast is taken may be a sculpture, building, a face, a pregnant belly, a fossil or other remains such as fresh or fossilised footprints – particularly in palaeontology (a track of dinosaur footprints made in this way can be seen outside the Oxford University Museum of Natural History).

Sometimes a blank block of plaster itself was carved to produce mock-ups or first drafts of sculptures (usually relief sculptures) that would ultimately be sculpted in stone, by measuring exactly from the cast, for example by using a pointing machine. These are still described as plaster casts. Examples of these by John Flaxman may be found in the central rotunda of the library at University College London, and elsewhere in the university&#x27;s collections. It may also describe a finished original sculpture made out of plaster, though these are rarer.

==Method==

Plaster is applied to the original to create a mould or cast (that is, a negative impression) of the original. This mould is then removed and fresh plaster is poured into it, creating a copy in plaster of the original. Usually very elaborate moulds were made out of several to even dozens of pieces, to cast the more difficult undercut sculptures. Plaster is not flexible, therefore the moulds were made as 3D jigsaw puzzles for easy removal of the original and the cast from the mould. Later gelatine, rubber and silicone moulds were used, backed by plaster or polyester for support.

==History==
===Early===
The practice of reproducing famous sculptures in plaster originally dates back to the sixteenth century when Leone Leoni assembled a collection of casts in Milan. He collected &quot;as many of the most celebrated works… carved and cast, antique and modern as he was able to obtain anywhere&quot;. Such private collections, however, remained modest and uncommon until the 18th century.

===Classical sculpture===

Use of such casts was particularly prevalent among classicists of the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 there were extensive collections in Berlin, Paris, Vienna and elsewhere. A museum or gallery of plaster casts may be called by the French term gypsotheque. By creating copies of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures held at various museums across Europe in this way, a reference collection of all the best and most representative sculptural types could be formed, at a fraction of the cost of purchasing original sculptures, which scholars could consult without necessarily having to travel abroad to see all the originals. These casts could also be used in experiments in polychromy (reconstructing paint layers found on sculptures), reconstruction (e.g. Adolf Furtwängler&#x27;s reconstruction of the Lemnian Athena from pieces found in different places), and for filling holes in a museum&#x27;s collections of actual sculpture (e.g. the British Museum sent casts of some of its Mesopotamian collection to the Louvre in return for a cast of the Louvre&#x27;s Code of Hammurabi).

===Other ancient cultures===

The technique was also applied later that century to reliefs from Ancient Egypt and friezes from Mesopotamia (examples of both of which may be seen on the North-East Staircase and in Room 52 of the British Museum), as well as to medieval and Renaissance sculptures (as may be seen in the Cast Courts at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which were a product of growing interest in medieval art at that time and the resulting desire to have a &quot;reference collection&quot; of such art). In the early 19th century, for example, perhaps as an expression of national pride, casts were made of outstanding national monuments particularly in France and Germany.

==Cast collections==
As well as those locations mentioned above, classical cast collections may be seen at the Museum of Classical Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, in the Royal Cast Collection in Copenhagen, and the Bellarmine Museum of Art at Fairfield University. The British Museum also holds classical casts, but these are currently all in storage.

The French term for a collection or gallery of casts is a &quot;gypsotheque&quot;, as at the Louvre.

<doc id="1006271" wikidata="Q17126762" url="?curid=1006271" title="Maquette">
<text>A maquette is a scale model or rough draft of an unfinished sculpture or work of architecture. The term is a loanword from French. An equivalent term is bozzetto, a diminutive of the Italian word for a sketch.

== Sculpture ==

A maquette is used to visualize and test forms and ideas without incurring the expense and effort of producing a full-scale piece. It is the analogue of the painter&#x27;s cartoon, &quot;modello&quot;, oil sketch, or drawn sketch. For commissioned works, especially monumental public sculptures, a maquette may be used to show the client how the finished work will relate to its proposed site. The term may also refer to a prototype for a video game, film, or other media. &quot;Modello&quot;, unlike the other terms, is also used for sketches for two-dimensional works such as paintings. Like oil sketches, these models by highly regarded artists can become as desirable as their completed works, as they show the process of developing an idea. For example, eleven bozzetti by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, a Baroque sculptor who made his models from wax or baked terracotta, were displayed in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004. Some museums, such as the Museo dei Bozzetti in Pietrasanta, Italy, specialize in collections of maquettes. Maquette is also used by animators when finalizing a character design and it can also act as reference for the animators.

== Fashion ==

In fashion design, a maquette may be referred to as a fashion doll. From the 16th century, these miniature versions of full-scale costumes were intended to demonstrate the latest trends and designs and allow customers to view the garment before purchasing.

In the 1950s, Irish fashion designer Sybil Connolly created a series of maquettes based on her designs including her iconic pleated linen dress First Love. These are now found in the Hunt Museum.

<doc id="1006274" wikidata="Q217539" url="?curid=1006274" title="Headspace (firearms)">
<text>In firearms, headspace is the distance measured from a closed chamber&#x27;s breech face to the chamber feature that limits the insertion depth of a cartridge placed in it. Used as a verb by firearms designers, &quot;headspacing&quot; refers to the act of stopping deeper cartridge insertion. The exact part of the cartridge that seats against the limiting chamber feature differs among cartridge and gun designs. In general, bottleneck rifle cartridges headspace on their case shoulders; rimmed cartridges headspace on the forward surfaces of their case rims; and rimless pistol cartridges headspace on their case mouths. The case belts on belted cartridges were originally added to allow headspacing on the belt&#x27;s forward surface, But in practice, this is often vestigial, and rifles chambered for belted cartridges may well headspace them on their shoulders and still be within CIP or SAAMI dimensional limits. However, belted cartridges and their corresponding chambers at their nominal CIP or SAAMI dimensions (maximum cartridge in minimum chamber) will headspace on the belt.

When the headspace is larger than the cartridge case, there is front-to-back cartridge wiggle room when the breech of the gun is closed. This extra space is called &quot;head clearance&quot;. Many, including some major manufacturers, confuse head clearance with headspace in their literature. This commonplace error is explained in the glossary of firearms terms maintained by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI), which is the ASTM standards organization for the U.S. firearms and ammunition industry. Excessive head clearance is undesirable for several reasons. It can allow a cartridge to slide forward beyond the distance within which the firing pin has the ability to adequately indent the primer for reliable ignition (though extractor hooks may act as the replacement headspace determinant in this situation). In chamber designs that don&#x27;t fully support the case head, excess headspace can allow a case to expand excessively, which can thin or crack open the brass. Thus, the cartridge can rupture rearward, which releases hot gases under high pressure that can damage the firearm and injure or even kill the shooter or bystanders. 

If a chamber&#x27;s headspace is too short, the gun may be unable to go fully into battery (close and lock completely), preventing firing.

==Cartridge types==

All small arms cartridges have a flange at the base of the case called a rim. The part of the firearm called an extractor claw hooks over the rim to extract the spent case from the chamber after it has been fired. The cartridge is said to be of a &quot;rimmed&quot; type when the rim is of larger diameter than the remainder of the case. Most early cartridges were rimmed, and the rim-stop ledge at the rear of the chamber prevents the cartridge from moving forward. Headspace for rimmed cartridges is the space between that forward ledge and the bolt face when the action is closed.

The cartridge is said to be &quot;rimless&quot; if the extractor groove is machined into the head of the case so the rim is the same diameter as the adjacent part of the case. Most modern automatic firearms use rimless cartridges. Straight-walled rimless cartridges often headspace on the forward lip of the cartridge as shown in the diagram at the top of this article. This necessitates careful attention to consistent case length. Bottle-necked rimless cartridges are intended to headspace on the conical shoulder between the narrow neck and the larger diameter portion of the case.

Some large rimless magnum cartridges have a &quot;belt&quot; formed above the extractor groove. This belt is of slightly larger diameter than the adjacent case, so the cartridge can headspace from the forward edge of the belt closest to the bullet. The original purpose of the belt was to give accurate headspacing for cartridges with shallow shoulder angles, where longitudinal precision of seating using such a shoulder presents difficulties. In effect this was similar to the headspacing function of a rim, but gave a long enough surface for cartridges to lie side-by-side in a magazine without risk of interference during the feed-stroke. The adoption of the belt as headspacing feature on rounds such as the .300 H&amp;H Magnum and its derivatives ultimately started a fashion that resulted in most later magnum rifle cartridges featuring belts.

Some more or less straight cartridges have no bottleneck on which to headspace. Such cylindrical shaped cartridge cases use the case mouth (the forward end of a cartridge case) as a forward positioned flange used for headspacing.

===C.I.P. ammunition approval procedure and headspace===
The standards organization Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (Permanent International Commission for Firearms Testing - commonly abbreviated as C.I.P. or CIP) uses a rimless, rimmed, magnum, pistol and revolver and rimfire cartridges classification to differentiate between hundreds of different small arms chamberings. The dimensional checking of the ammunition, as described in the C.I.P. Decisions, Texts and Tables, is left to the manufacturers themselves. During C.I.P. ammunition approval headspace is not checked, even on rimless cartridges with taper. The view is that in the very unlikely case (according to the current quality standards) the cartridge is too long, once pressed by the bolt, the chambering force will rise too high causing rejection. If it is too short, firing will fail also causing rejection.

==Theory==
A firearm cartridge case serves multiple functions. The most obvious role is to provide a container for the powder, bullet, and primer. Additionally though, upon firing, the expanding case seals the breech of the firearm to prevent burning powder gas from escaping rearward. Most cartridge cases are made of brass and expand under pressure to form a closed gas tight fit with the sides of the chamber, and then contract slightly so that the case remains loose and can be removed. Centerfire cartridge cases are thicker near the base to prevent expansion into openings between the rear end of the barrel and the action where the cartridge case is not fully enclosed or supported by the chamber.

When a firearm has more headspace than the cartridge design anticipated, the closing of the bolt or impact of the firing pin may move the cartridge forward to leave space between the chamber face of the action and the base of the cartridge. Pressure of burning powder gasses expands the thinner forward walls of the cartridge case to firmly grip against the sides of the chamber preventing rearward motion. The thicker base of the cartridge case (or sometimes the primer) may then be forced back into available space at the rear of the chamber, causing the case to stretch. Where rearward movement exceeds cartridge design, the primer may rupture or the base of the cartridge case may begin to separate from the forward walls. Either type of failure may release high pressure gas and case fragments from the action of the firearm. These may cause burns, cuts, or eye injury to the shooter or persons standing nearby.

Headspace is a critical consideration in any firearm. It should be checked by a competent person using the appropriate headspace gauges prior to using the firearm.

==Gauges==
To check that a firearm&#x27;s headspace is within manufacturer&#x27;s tolerances, manufacturers supply Go/no go gauges. These gauges are pieces of tool steel, cut to precise lengths. They&#x27;re shaped like cartridges so they fit in the firearm&#x27;s chamber. The firearm&#x27;s bolt should close normally on the &quot;go&quot; gauge, and should not close on the &quot;no-go&quot; gauge.

A third gauge, the &quot;Field&quot; gauge (slightly longer than &quot;no-go&quot;), is used in the field to indicate the absolute maximum safe headspace. This gauge is used because, over time, the bolt and receiver will wear, the bolt and lugs compress, and the receiver may stretch, all causing the headspace to gradually increase from the factory specifications measured by the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;no-go&quot; gauges. A bolt that closes on &quot;no-go&quot; but not on &quot;field&quot; is close to being unsafe to fire, and may malfunction on cartridges that are slightly out of specification. 

Headspace gauges are typically used by inserting the gauge into the bolt face engaging the extractor claw and then into the firearm chamber, and noting upon which gauge the bolt fully closes, and which it does not. The closing force applied to the bolt on a bolt-action firearm when making these assessments should be consistently and lightly applied; otherwise, an incorrect assessment of headspace will result if the bolt is forced close with excessive pressure.

The below table illustrates the function of each gauge:
==Other cartridge dimensions==
Headspace is not the only important cartridge dimension. Other dimensions like overall cartridge length and base diameter are also significant for proper fit of a cartridge into a firearm, and may be included as part of a headspace gauge. Cartridges very close to chamber dimensions generally offer superior accuracy, but slightly undersized cartridges load more smoothly and reliably under variable temperature conditions or when fouling accumulates in the chamber or cartridges become corroded.

A firearm chamber for rimmed ammunition will often have two small ledges or steps. One at the rear engages with the forward face of the rim, as the rim-stop. The other step in the front of the chamber accommodates the thickness of the case wall at the forward edge of the case neck where the projectile emerges as a close fit to the beginning of the bore, the throat or leade. If the case length is too long, then the bolt on closing pushes the case over the forward step of the chamber at the throat / leade and can crush or crimp the case around the projectile at the neck of the case, leading to all sorts of performance, pressure and safety problems. 

Many target shooters who use rimmed ammunition, such as .303 British, will carefully sort the cases by headstamps into groups of the same make or batch, then gauge the thickness of the case rim into lots of the same, or very close, rim thickness. They then keep the fire-formed cases which are now optimised in shape to that firearm chamber, thereby increasing the accuracy potential by only having to resize the neck of the case and to trim-to-length so that the batch performance of the reloaded ammunition is as consistent as is possible from shot to shot. Some competition reloaders leave the primer slightly proud of the case by a known amount that is taken up when the bolt is locked home. This mechanical action on the center of the case base via the primer, as it is pushed a very small amount further into its cup, translates into an even distribution of pressure through the rim to the rim-stop. This also gives the advantage of the firing pin indenting the primer in a similar fashion from shot to shot as the primer cup is in direct contact with the bolt face. As with any reloading all care must be taken and manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations followed.

==Headspace actuated blowback==
An unusual firearms operation has been used, in particular with prototype firearms using headspace as part of its operation. This works with the cartridge moving backwards, stretching it to an extent until it unlocks the bolt to cycle its operation.

<doc id="1006284" wikidata="Q2397955" url="?curid=1006284" title="Tayto (Republic of Ireland)">
<text>Tayto Snacks is a crisp and popcorn manufacturer in Ireland, founded by Joe Murphy in May 1954 and owned by German snack food company Intersnack. It owns several brands, including its leading product of Tayto Crisps for which it invented the first flavoured crisp production process. The first seasoned crisps produced were Cheese &amp; Onion. Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto&#x27;s technique. Tayto crisps are a cultural phenomenon throughout Ireland, so much so that in November 2010, Tayto opened their own theme park called &quot;Tayto Park&quot; near Ashbourne.

The company is entirely separate from Tayto Group Limited in Northern Ireland, which has a similar product range. Tayto in the Republic of Ireland owns the name and mascot, and Tayto in Northern Ireland uses both under a licensing agreement. The Northern Irish Tayto is widely sold in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain, while the Republic of Ireland brand is sold in the Republic.

==History and ownership==

Tayto was founded in 1954 in Dublin by a local man known as Joe &#x27;Spud&#x27; Murphy, who is credited with having invented the world&#x27;s first flavoured crisp.

Two years later, in 1956, the licensing rights of the Tayto name and recipes were sold to the Hutchinson family for distribution outside the Republic of Ireland and allowed for the creation of Tayto (Northern Ireland).

The company came to be owned by Cantrell and Cochrane (C. &amp; C), and was based in Coolock, Dublin, until that factory was closed in September 2005, with production outsourced to Ray Coyle&#x27;s Largo Foods. Largo agreed to purchase the brand from C. &amp; C. in May 2006 for €62.3 million. 

Coyle sold partial control of the company to German food company Intersnack, and in 2015, he sold his remaining shares, ending the Irish ownership of the company. In Northern Ireland, Tayto Limited is still owned and run by the Hutchinson family and is totally distinct from Tayto in Republic of Ireland, from which it licences the brand.

== Brands ==

Tayto crisps come in several flavours: Cheese &amp; Onion, Salt &amp; Vinegar, Smokey Bacon, Prawn Cocktail, and the limited edition flavour Tex Mex.

In the early 2000s, the company targeted the healthy eating market, with its low salt, low fat crisps, originally branded as &quot;Honest&quot;. Tayto referred to this range as the &quot;Happy &amp; Healthy range&quot;. The healthy range has since evolved and Tayto have launched Tayto Lentils which is 40% less fat to target the healthy eating market.

Tayto Snack&#x27;s portfolio of brands in the Republic of Ireland includes Tayto, King, O&#x27;Donnells of Tipperary, Hunky Dorys, Hula Hoops, Popchips, KP, Penn State, Pom-Bear, &amp; McCoy&#x27;s.

==Marketing==
Tayto has used its mascot, &quot;Mr Tayto&quot;, in a number of marketing campaigns with previous endorsers such as Westlife. In the 2007 Irish general election, Tayto ran an advertising campaign with Mr Tayto as a fake election candidate. Tayto claimed that the number of spoiled votes in the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency indicate that some actually voted for their mascot, but this is purely speculative. Tayto was fined during the campaign for littering, due to its fake election posters being posted in public places.

In 2009 Tayto Ltd. published &quot;The Man Inside the Jacket&quot;, a fictional autobiography of Mr Tayto written by Maia Dunphy, Ciaran Morrison and Mick O&#x27;Hara. Tayto indicated that a percentage of the cover price would go to Irish charity Aware, which assists people affected by depression, bipolar disorder and related mood conditions.

In May 2022 the Mr. Tayto mascot was removed from all Cheese &amp; Onion packaging, and a &quot;Where Is Mr. Tayto&quot; tagline was added. Later that month, a statement was made from Mr. Tayto&#x27;s official social media accounts which claimed that Mr. Tayto was taking a break from work to see the world, beginning the &quot;Mr. Tayto&#x27;s Bucket List&quot; campaign.

== Tayto Park ==

In November 2010, Ray Coyle (who owned Largo Foods and Tayto at the time), opened a theme park named Tayto Park near Ashbourne in County Meath The park remained under Coyle&#x27;s ownership when Largo Foods and the Tayto brand became part of Intersnack. Factory tours were available in conjunction with visits to the theme park on certain days. 

In February 2022, it was announced that the existing title sponsorship contract would not be renewed, with the park renamed to &quot;Emerald Park&quot; when the existing contract expired in January 2023.

== Legal action ==
In 2006, Tayto tried to compel Irish band Toasted Heretic to destroy all copies of their album &quot;Now in New Nostalgia Flavour&quot;, which featured an image based on the trademarked &quot;Mr Tayto&quot; icon, although the image had been used since 1988 on Toasted Heretic&#x27;s cassette album &quot;Songs for Swinging Celibates&quot;.

==Advertising==
It&#x27;s possible that Tayto could have been the first product to be advertised on Irish television, during Christmas of 1961, but this is difficult to confirm. Furthermore, Tayto had a number of popular advertisements featuring the tagline &quot;They Ate The Wonder Of The World&quot; in 1993 and the company also sponsored a GAA football match in 2005. In 2023, Tayto debuted a Christmas advert featuring Father Christmas.

<doc id="1006287" wikidata="Q951130" url="?curid=1006287" title="Sandy Lyle">
<text>Alexander Walter Barr &quot;Sandy&quot; Lyle (born 9 February 1958) is a Scottish professional golfer. He has won two major championships during his career. Along with Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam, he became one of Britain&#x27;s top golfers during the 1980s. He spent 167 weeks in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Ranking from its introduction, in 1986, until 1989. 

==Early life==
Lyle was born in Shrewsbury, England and now lives in Scotland with his wife Jolande and children Lonneke and Quintin. He represented Scotland during his professional career. He was introduced to golf by his father, Alex, who had taken the family from Scotland to England in 1955 when he became resident professional at Hawkstone Park golf course. Their family home was just 40 yards from the pro-shop and 18th green. He began playing with miniature clubs at the age of 3. At schoolboy, junior and amateur level Lyle represented England.

== Amateur career ==
In the summer of 1974, Lyle received a golf scholarship to the University of Houston. However, he did not pass the entrance examination and was not allowed to attend the university. Lyle returned to Britain &quot;to find another route into professional golf.&quot;

As an amateur Lyle made his debut in The Open Championship at age 16 in 1974 and won the Brabazon Trophy in 1975 and 1977. He was a member of the Walker Cup team in 1977.

==Professional career==
In 1977 he turned professional and decided to represent Scotland. He was medalist at the 1977 Qualifying School tournament for the European Tour. His first professional win came in the 1978 Nigerian Open, and he also won the Sir Henry Cotton Award as European Rookie of the Year that season. Lyle attained the first of an eventual 18 European Tour titles in 1979.

Lyle, for Scotland, finished runner-up at the World Cup of Golf team event in 1979, 1980 and 1987; in the latter year Lyle captured the low individual trophy in that event.

Lyle showed his quality by winning The Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club in 1985. He was the first British winner since Tony Jacklin in 1969, and continued the rise of European golfers in the world scene.

Lyle was a member of five European Ryder Cup teams, from 1979 to 1987 inclusive. Highlights from those years included the team that was victorious at the Belfry in the autumn of 1985, and the 1987 team which won for the first time ever on American soil, at Muirfield Village.

For many golf fans he is best known for the fairway bunker shot and the subsequent birdie putt at the 18th hole in the final round of the Masters in 1988 when he became the first Briton to wear the green jacket. He also won two other events on the PGA Tour that season, along with the World Match Play Championship, after being a losing finalist on several occasions.

Lyle topped the European Tour&#x27;s order of merit in 1979, 1980 and 1985. He finished in the top ten nine times between 1979 and 1992. He was also a member of the PGA Tour for several years and finished seventh on the US money list in 1988, despite a limited playing schedule. He won the 1987 Tournament Players Championship, one of the most prestigious American titles. Lyle&#x27;s form dropped after 1992, when he was 34, and he has not won a significant event since.

=== Senior career ===
On turning 50 in 2008, Lyle played on the Champions Tour and the European Senior Tour.

Lyle won his first tournament in 19 years when he captured his first European Senior Tour title at the 2011 ISPS Handa Senior World Championship, held in China.

He took up hickory golf, winning the World Hickory Open in his native Scotland in 2014 and 2016. Lyle referred to the 2016 victory as his &quot;fourth major&quot; to go along with the 2014 crown, as well as the 1988 Masters and 1985 Open titles. 

==Legacy==
As a player, Lyle is known for his cool temperament and placid exterior. In his peak years, he was very long from the tee and through the set, and had enough accuracy to master any course. His achievements inspired fellow rivals such as Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam to raise their games, and go on to win the majors. Lyle published his first book, &quot;To the Fairway Born&quot; in 2006. In the same year he was assistant captain to Ian Woosnam when Europe won the Ryder Cup. He had been hoping to be picked as the captain for the 2010 European Ryder Cup team but missed out to Colin Montgomerie.

In July 2009, Lyle became involved in a public row with Colin Montgomerie where he unfavourably compared Montgomerie&#x27;s actions at the Indonesian Open four years previously with his own actions in not completing a round at the 2008 Open Championship. Reaction to this was mixed with some players supporting Lyle while other players and commentators felt that Lyle&#x27;s timing was unfortunate and that any point he may have had was lost in the ensuing controversy.

== Awards and honors ==

<text>Virginia &quot;Patsy&quot; Garrett (May 4, 1921 – January 8, 2015) was an American actress and singer. Beginning her career as a radio performer at the age of seven, Garrett is best known for her seven years on Fred Waring&#x27;s &quot;Pleasure Time&quot; radio show during the 1940s, as well as for her recurring television and film roles; as nosy neighbor Mrs. Florence Fowler on &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; (1970–1971), school secretary Miss Hogarth on &quot;Room 222&quot; (1972–1973), as Mary Gruber in the &quot;Benji&quot; series of motion pictures beginning in 1974, and as a commercial spokesperson for Purina Cat Chow cat food.

==Career==
Active on stage, screen and television beginning with a dance recital at age four, Garrett had her own children&#x27;s radio show in Richmond, Virginia by age seven. At the age of seventeen, Garrett was a regular on Fred Waring&#x27;s national radio show &quot;Pleasure Time&quot; as a comic singer from 1938 to 1945. During this time, she was approached by Cole Porter to promote a ballad (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;) which he had written for a new musical. In 1981, Garrett was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award recognizing her achievements within the entertainment industry as a child actress and singer.

In the late 1960s, Garrett provided cartoon voiceovers for a number of Hanna-Barbera projects, including &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;. A small part as the mayor&#x27;s wife in a 1969 Elvis Presley movie, &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot;, reportedly led to a lifelong friendship with the singer. While working on the film, Garrett frequently baked cookies for the cast. Presley&#x27;s schedule usually meant his arriving late on the set, which in turn meant that he missed out on the treats. Garrett baked him a special batch which he brought with him to Las Vegas where he was scheduled to perform. As she was passing through Las Vegas, Garrett reportedly phoned Presley not for tickets, but for the return of her baking tin.

U.S. television audiences of the 1970s may remember Garrett for another recurring role in a series of commercial messages as the &quot;Purina Cat Chow Lady.&quot; A post-production trick involving the controlled forward motion and reversal of the film had Garrett dancing the &quot;chow-chow-chow&quot; with a cat in a good-humored parody of the cha-cha-cha.

==Later years==
In 2000, the TV Land cable television channel aired the original Purina commercials as part of their &quot;Retromercials&quot; series of fondly remembered national television ads of the past. On November 28, 2004, California&#x27;s Desert Theater League awarded Garrett its lifetime achievement award. She continued to appear in local theater productions in and around the Palm Springs, California, area. She died on January 8, 2015, after a brief illness.

<doc id="1006293" wikidata="Q3657270" url="?curid=1006293" title="Biorobotics">
<text>Biorobotics is an interdisciplinary science that combines the fields of biomedical engineering, cybernetics, and robotics to develop new technologies that integrate biology with mechanical systems to develop more efficient communication, alter genetic information, and create machines that imitate biological systems.

== Cybernetics ==
Cybernetics focuses on the communication and system of living organisms and machines that can be applied and combined with multiple fields of study such as biology, mathematics, computer science, engineering, and much more.

This discipline falls under the branch of biorobotics because of its combined field of study between biological bodies and mechanical systems. Studying these two systems allow for advanced analysis on the functions and processes of each system as well as the interactions between them.

=== History ===
Cybernetic theory is a concept that has existed for centuries, dating back to the era of Plato where he applied the term to refer to the &quot;governance of people&quot;. The term &quot;cybernetique&quot; is seen in the mid-1800s used by physicist André-Marie Ampère. The term &quot;cybernetics&quot; was popularized in the late 1940s to refer to a discipline that touched on, but was separate, from established disciplines, such as electrical engineering, mathematics, and biology.

=== Science ===
Cybernetics is often misunderstood because of the breadth of disciplines it covers. In the early 20th century, it was coined as an interdisciplinary field of study that combines biology, science, network theory, and engineering. Today, it covers all scientific fields with system related processes. The goal of cybernetics is to analyze systems and processes of any system or systems in an attempt to make them more efficient and effective.

=== Applications ===
Cybernetics is used as an umbrella term so applications extend to all systems related scientific fields such as biology, mathematics, computer science, engineering, management, psychology, sociology, art, and more. Cybernetics is used amongst several fields to discover principles of systems, adaptation of organisms, information analysis and much more.

== Genetic engineering ==
Genetic engineering is a field that uses advances in technology to modify biological organisms. Through different methods, scientists are able to alter the genetic material of microorganisms, plants and animals to provide them with desirable traits. For example, making plants grow bigger, better, and faster. Genetic engineering is included in biorobotics because it uses new technologies to alter biology and change an organism&#x27;s DNA for their and society&#x27;s benefit.

=== History ===
Although humans have modified genetic material of animals and plants through artificial selection for millennia (such as the genetic mutations that developed teosinte into corn and wolves into dogs), &quot;genetic engineering&quot; refers to the deliberate alteration or insertion of specific genes to an organism&#x27;s DNA. The first successful case of genetic engineering occurred in 1973 when Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen were able to transfer a gene with antibiotic resistance to a bacterium.

=== Science ===
There are three main techniques used in genetic engineering: The plasmid method, the vector method and the biolistic method.

==== Plasmid method ====
This technique is used mainly for microorganisms such as bacteria. Through this method, DNA molecules called plasmids are extracted from bacteria and placed in a lab where restriction enzymes break them down. As the enzymes break the molecules down, some develop a rough edge that resembles that of a staircase which is considered &#x27;sticky&#x27; and capable of reconnecting. These &#x27;sticky&#x27; molecules are inserted into another bacteria where they will connect to the DNA rings with the altered genetic material.

==== Vector method ====
The vector method is considered a more precise technique than the plasmid method as it involves the transfer of a specific gene instead of a whole sequence. In the vector method, a specific gene from a DNA strand is isolated through restriction enzymes in a laboratory and is inserted into a vector. Once the vector accepts the genetic code, it is inserted into the host cell where the DNA will be transferred.

==== Biolistic method ====
The biolistic method is typically used to alter the genetic material of plants. This method embeds the desired DNA with a metallic particle such as gold or tungsten in a high speed gun. The particle is then bombarded into the plant. Due to the high velocities and the vacuum generated during bombardment, the particle is able to penetrate the cell wall and inserts the new DNA into the cell.

=== Applications ===
Genetic engineering has many uses in the fields of medicine, research and agriculture. In the medical field, genetically modified bacteria are used to produce drugs such as insulin, human growth hormones and vaccines. In research, scientists genetically modify organisms to observe physical and behavioral changes to understand the function of specific genes. In agriculture, genetic engineering is extremely important as it is used by farmers to grow crops that are resistant to herbicides and to insects such as BTCorn.

== Bionics ==

Bionics is a medical engineering field and a branch of biorobotics consisting of electrical and mechanical systems that imitate biological systems, such as prosthetics and hearing aids. It&#x27;s a portmanteau that combines biology and electronics.

=== History===
The history of bionics goes as far back in time as ancient Egypt. A prosthetic toe made out of wood and leather was found on the foot of a mummy. The time period of the mummy corpse was estimated to be from around the fifteenth century B.C. Bionics can also be witnessed in ancient Greece and Rome. Prosthetic legs and arms were made for amputee soldiers. In the early 16th century, a French military surgeon by the name of Ambroise Pare became a pioneer in the field of bionics. He was known for making various types of upper and lower prosthetics. One of his most famous prosthetics, Le Petit Lorrain, was a mechanical hand operated by catches and springs. During the early 19th century, Alessandro Volta further progressed bionics. He set the foundation for the creation of hearing aids with his experiments. He found that electrical stimulation could restore hearing by inserting an electrical implant to the saccular nerve of a patient&#x27;s ear. In 1945, the National Academy of Sciences created the Artificial Limb Program, which focused on improving prosthetics since there were a large number of World War II amputee soldiers. Since this creation, prosthetic materials, computer design methods, and surgical procedures have improved, creating modern-day bionics.

=== Science ===

==== Prosthetics====

The important components that make up modern-day prosthetics are the pylon, the socket, and the suspension system. The pylon is the internal frame of the prosthetic that is made up of metal rods or carbon-fiber composites. The socket is the part of the prosthetic that connects the prosthetic to the person&#x27;s missing limb. The socket consists of a soft liner that makes the fit comfortable, but also snug enough to stay on the limb. The suspension system is important in keeping the prosthetic on the limb. The suspension system is usually a harness system made up of straps, belts or sleeves that are used to keep the limb attached.

The operation of a prosthetic could be designed in various ways. The prosthetic could be body-powered, externally-powered, or myoelectrically powered. Body-powered prosthetics consist of cables attached to a strap or harness, which is placed on the person&#x27;s functional shoulder, allowing the person to manipulate and control the prosthetic as he or she deems fit. Externally-powered prosthetics consist of motors to power the prosthetic and buttons and switches to control the prosthetic. Myoelectrically powered prosthetics are new, advanced forms of prosthetics where electrodes are placed on the muscles above the limb. The electrodes will detect the muscle contractions and send electrical signals to the prosthetic to move the prosthetic. The downside to this type of prosthetic is that if the sensors are not placed correctly on the limb then the electrical impulses will fail to move the prosthetic. TrueLimb is a specific brand of prosthetics that uses myoelectrical sensors which enable a person to have control of their bionic limb.

==== Hearing aids====

Four major components make up the hearing aid: the microphone, the amplifier, the receiver, and the battery. The microphone takes in outside sound, turns that sound to electrical signals, and sends those signals to the amplifier. The amplifier increases the sound and sends that sound to the receiver. The receiver changes the electrical signal back into sound and sends the sound into the ear. Hair cells in the ear will sense the vibrations from the sound, convert the vibrations into nerve signals, and send it to the brain so the sounds can become coherent to the person. The battery simply powers the hearing aid.

=== Applications===
==== Cochlear Implant ====

Cochlear implants are a type of hearing aid for those who are deaf. Cochlear implants send electrical signals straight to the auditory nerve, the nerve responsible for sound signals, instead of just sending the signals to the ear canal like conventional hearing aids.

==== Bone-Anchored Hearing Aids ====
These hearing aids are also used for people with severe hearing loss. They attach to the bones of the middle ear to create sound vibrations in the skull and send those vibrations to the cochlea.

==== Artificial sensing skin ====

Artificial sensing-skin detects any pressure put on it and is meant for people who have lost any sense of feeling on parts of their bodies, such as diabetics with peripheral neuropathy.

==== Bionic eye ====

A bionic eye is a bioelectronic implant designed to restore vision for individuals with blindness.

Although the technology is still in development, it has enabled some legally blind individuals to distinguish letters again.
Replicating the retina, which contains millions of photoreceptors, and matching the human eye’s exceptional lensing and dynamic range capabilities pose significant challenges. Neural integration further complicates the process. Despite these difficulties, ongoing research and prototyping have led to several major achievements in recent years.

==== Orthopedic bionics ====
Orthopedic bionics consist of advanced bionic limbs that use a person&#x27;s neuromuscular system to control the bionic limb. A new advancement in the comprehension of brain function has led to the development and implementation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). BMIs allow for the processing of neural messaging between motor regions of the brain to muscles of a specific limb to initiate movement. BMIs contribute greatly to the restoration of a person&#x27;s independent movement who has a bionic limb and or an exoskeleton.

==== Endoscopic robotics ====

== Biohybrid robots ==
Biohybrid robots are mechanical robots that incorporate in them biological elements. For example, a drone that has odor biosensors that incorporate antenna taken from a male silkworm moth, which can be used for odor-source localization.

== Animal-robot interactions ==

Animal-robot interactions is a field of Biorobotics that focuses on the blending of robotic compounds with animal individuals or populations. The domain can be subdivided into two main branches, one that relates mechatronic devices with individual animals, and another one with animal populations. Both branches have a variety of applications, ranging from animal cyborgs benefiting from animals&#x27; superior motor capabilities to ethological studies around animal collective behaviour. While this representation draws a globally accurate view of the domain, some animal-robot interactions cannot be strictly classified into one or the other of these branches, or are sometimes a mixture of both. This is the case namely for ethological robots that interact on a one-to-one basis or when eusocial animals are considered as a single superorganism interacting with a single robotic device. In the latter case, the term Bio-Hybrid superorganism is used to describe the blending of a robotic device with a superorganism to enable interaction, control and thus studying of the latter superorganism. 

=== Bio-Hybrid organisms ===

=== Mixed societies ===
Mixed societies blend together a set of animals (animal society) with a set of robotic devices (artificial society). Care should be take when using the word society, as the noun could be misleading within the zoologist community that is involved in this domain; a more accurate word would be populations, which is also the one used for the rest of this section.

Typically, the robotic population is composed of robotic replica of the target animal individuals aimed to integrate within the animal population. To do this, stimuli naturally perceived by the animals are emitted by the robotic individuals, and this through different communication channels: visual cues, thermal pulses, vibration signals, etc. The degree to which the robotic individuals successfully blend with the animal population is related to as bio-acceptance, and is often key to enable further behavioural study of the target species. 

Once interactions between the animal and robot population is achieved by establishing relevant communication channels, mixed societies offer the potential for adaptive robotic behaviours driven by real-time feedback from the animal population. By responding directly to animal behaviour, the robots can dynamically adjust their actions to better integrate into the group. This capability is particularly valuable for understanding collective behaviours in animal populations. Adaptive robots can be used to implement models of specific roles or interactions within a group, enabling the testing of hypotheses about coordination, decision-making, or social organisation. This approach bridges experimental and modelling techniques, in an attempt to offer insights into the underlying mechanisms of collective behaviour.

<text>Barham Salih (; ; born 8 September 1960) is an Iraqi Kurdish politician who served as the eighth president of Iraq from 2018 to 2022.

He is the former prime minister of the Kurdistan Region and a former deputy prime minister of the Iraqi federal government. He was elected and assumed office as president of Iraq on 2 October 2018. Salih is the third non-Arab president of Iraq, succeeding Fuad Masum, also Kurdish. In October 2022 he lost his re-election to Abdul Latif Rashid.

==Early life and education==
Salih was born in 1960 in Sulaymaniyah. He was arrested in 1979 by the Ba&#x27;athist regime twice on charges of involvement in the Kurdish national movement by taking some photos of protesters in Sulaimaniya city and spent 43 days in detention in a Special Investigation Commission prison in Kirkuk where he was tortured. Once released, he finished high school and left Iraq for the United Kingdom to flee continued persecution.

==Personal life==
Salih is married to Sarbagh Salih, the head and founding member of the Kurdish Botanical Foundation and a women&#x27;s rights activist. The couple have two children.

==Career==
===Deputy Secretary General of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan===
Barham Salih joined the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in late 1976 where he became a member of the PUK department of Europe, and was in charge of PUK foreign relations in London. In addition to the political struggle, he finished his university studies and received a Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering and Construction from the Cardiff University in 1983. He continued to study and obtained a Doctorate degree in Statistics and Computer Applications in Engineering from the University of Liverpool in 1987.

He was elected a member of the PUK leadership at the first party conference when Iraqi Kurdistan was liberated from the Ba&#x27;ath Party following the Persian Gulf War. He was assigned the task of heading the PUK Office in the United States.

After the fall of the Ba&#x27;athist regime in 2003, he became Deputy Prime Minister in the Interim Iraqi Government in mid-2004, Minister of Planning in the Transitional Government in 2005, and Deputy Prime Minister in the elected Iraqi Government (Nouri al-Maliki&#x27;s Cabinet) in charge of the economic portfolio and Head of the Economic Committee. Representing the Iraqi Government, he launched the International Compact with Iraq – an initiative of mutual commitment between Iraq and the international community to help Iraq in meeting its obligations of &quot;building a prosperous, democratic and federal country, in peace with itself and with the region and the world&quot;.

Salih appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on 10 June 2009, broadcast from Baghdad, and was interviewed by the host. He praised the U.S. military for sending troops into Iraq, and acknowledged that many Kurds desire independence.

===Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region Government===
Barham Salih spearheaded the Kurdistani List in the 2009 Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election. The list won 59 of 111 seats. He succeeded Nechervan Idris Barzani as the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government. His term was marked by turbulence with the rise of an opposition (Movement for Change) to challenge the government while his own party was scrambling to stay together after losing the stronghold city of Sulaymaniyah. He survived the first motion of no confidence in Iraqi Kurdistan following the 2011 Kurdish protests in Iraq. He signed the first major oil contract with ExxonMobil after drafting and amending a new oil law. He relinquished the post of Prime Minister to Nechervan Idris Barzani on 5 April 2012 as part of a political agreement between the ruling KDP–PUK coalition.

=== Foundation of an own party and subsequent return to PUK ===
In September 2017, Salih announced that he was leaving the PUK and forming a new opposition party, the Coalition for Democracy and Justice, to compete in the forthcoming Iraqi Kurdistan elections. Following the death of PUK leader Jalal Talabani and the Kurdish opposition leader Nawshirwan Mustafa, the alliance was seen to have the potential to change the Kurdish political landscape. He said he hoped to gather all the other opposition parties, including Gorran and Komal, to challenge the governing KDP–PUK alliance.

In the 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election, it won two seats. On September 19, 2018, Barham Salih left the party to rejoin the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which nominated him as a candidate for Iraq&#x27;s Presidency. Others joined Salih in his return to PUK, but the party leadership made clear that it would not be going to disband itself. On 9 November 2018, the party held a conference, where it renamed itself to National Coalition and elected Aram Qadirî as its leader. There were some legal problems, which were solved at the beginning of December, when the Independent High Electoral Commission moved to legally dissolve the no longer existing CDJ.

===President of Iraq===
On 2 October 2018, Barham Salih was elected as the eighth president of Iraq. He received 219 votes and defeated Fuad Hussein who secured 22 votes.

Salih condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, stating that it &quot;will cause untold humanitarian suffering, empower terrorist groups. The world must unite to avert a catastrophe, promote political resolution to the rights of all Syrians, including Kurds, to peace, dignity and security&quot;.

In March 2019, Salih submitted the groundbreaking “Yazidi Female Survivors Law” to Parliament for review. The ground-breaking bill set forth a number of reparation measures for female Yazidi survivors of captivity. It was seen by the Yazidi leaders as an important step toward a secure future for the survivors, and so they could move on and rebuild their homes, which were destroyed by IS fighting. On 1 March 2021, Parliament passed the Yazidi [Female] Survivors Bill into law, and the law was welcomed by Nadia Murad as &quot;an important first step in acknowledging the gender-based trauma of sexual violence and need for tangible redress.&quot;

On 24 September 2019, President Salih had his first bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.

On 26 December 2019, Salih submitted a letter of resignation after refusing to appoint Basra Governor Asaad Al Eidani as Prime Minister following the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi, amid ongoing protests across the country. Salih stated that Al Eidani would not be approved by the demonstrators.

== Assassination attempt ==
On 2 April 2002, Barham Salih was exposed to an assassination attempt by Ansar al-Islam group, Salih survived the assassination attempt.

==Criticism==
On 19 September 2018, the announcement that Barham Salih will be the PUK&#x27;s candidate for the post of Iraqi president was greeted with anger by many on social media while others expressed hope that his international reputation and experience would bring a steady hand to tumultuous Baghdad. 
Some took to the social media platform to call Salih out for perceived opportunism, noting he had just recently been campaigning against PUK and KDP corruption.

<doc id="1006317" wikidata="Q1269910" url="?curid=1006317" title="Republic of Madawaska">
<text>The Republic of Madawaska () was a putative republic in the northwest corner of Madawaska County, New Brunswick (also known as the &quot;New Brunswick Panhandle&quot;) and adjacent areas of Aroostook County in the US state of Maine and of Quebec. 

The word &quot;Madawaska&quot; comes from the Miꞌkmaq words &quot;madawas&quot; (place of) and &quot;kak&quot; (porcupine). Thus, the Madawaska is &quot;the country of the porcupine&quot;. 
The Madawaska River which flows into the Saint John River at Edmundston, New Brunswick, and Madawaska, Maine, flows through the region.

== History ==

The origins of the unorganized republic lie in the Treaty of Paris (1783), which established the border between the United States of America and the British North American colonies. As with several other disputed areas along the imprecisely defined border, the Madawaska area and the larger region of overlap between Maine and New Brunswick remained in dispute until 1842.

===John Baker===
In 1817, a US settler, John Baker, arrived in the region. He made his residence west of the junction of the Meruimticook (now Baker Brook, after him) and Saint John Rivers. This area is now Baker-Brook, New Brunswick. 
Outside of the Madawaska settlement, hardly anyone lived in what is now Aroostook County. At the 1830 census, Madawaska settlement had a population of 2,487 people. Aroostook, with 261, and Houlton Plantation, with 576, were the closest settlements.

In 1825, Baker petitioned the state of Maine for Madawaska&#x27;s inclusion in the state. Believing fervently that the territory belonged to Maine, Baker became an agitator and provocateur toward the British government. In 1827, Baker provoked the British authorities by attempting to stop the mail being sent by canoe from Madawaska to Quebec on the St. John River; by trying to get the French residents of Madawaska to reject British authority; by preventing a constable from carrying out an arrest; as well as other such defiance of British authority.

On July 4, 1827, John Baker held an Independence Day celebration at his house and invited all Madawaska settlers. At the time, 16 American families lived in the Upper Saint John River Valley, as well as French settlers. At his event, Baker proclaimed the entire Madawaska Territory to be independent of all foreign jurisdiction and vowed not to acknowledge any other authority than the United States. A flag sewn by his wife, Sophronia (aka Sophie) Rice, was raised in salute of the new republic. The event was followed by an evening ball at which Baker called another gathering for August 10 to consider ratifying a &quot;Compact&quot; government.
Baker himself prepared the Madawaska Compact, assisted by Steven Grover. It called for a pledge of mutual support and dispute resolution through elected arbiters without recourse to British authorities. The government was to be led by Baker as &quot;General&quot; of the Republic and two other men, Charles Stetson and James Bacon. The General was to be invested with special confiscatory powers. After one year of existence, the &quot;counterfeit republic&quot; was to apply to the State of Maine for annexation.

On August 10, 1827, a local magistrate arrived to confiscate &quot;the paper which had been offered for signature&quot; and call for Baker&#x27;s submission to New Brunswick&#x27;s authority. Baker refused, arguing he was on American soil. Mrs. Baker raised the Madawaska flag, and the magistrate ordered Baker to take it down, to be met again by Baker&#x27;s refusal. The magistrate departed, after which Baker traveled to Portland to ascertain from the governor and legislature the extent of protection the State would provide.

After being away for a month, he returned and three days later, on September 25, was arrested before dawn under a warrant issued during his absence. He was charged with high misdemeanors and spent the next 13 months in the Fredericton jail. Baker served the first seven months in jail because he could not afford both to post bail and, in a civil process, repay an overdue debt. In May, 1828, he was convicted by a jury &quot;for violently opposing and resisting His Majesty&#x27;s authority and the execution of the laws in the upper part of the parish of Kent, and attempting to seduce His Majesty&#x27;s subjects there to depart from their allegiance to His Majesty&quot;, fined £25 and jailed for two months unless the fine was paid. After two months, Baker still refused to pay the fine and was held in jail until October 21, when he did post bond to pay his fine before year-end.

===International attention===
The Baker situation became an international incident, with President John Quincy Adams asking Secretary of State Henry Clay to investigate the matter. Once informed, Clay exchanged letters with the British government regarding Baker. Both sides acknowledged that the U.S. could not be culpable for Baker&#x27;s agitations. The events, however, did add impetus to the need to settle the boundary.

In 1831, Baker led an effort to create a township of Madawaska after the Maine legislature re-emphasized its claims to the disputed northern area. A warrant was issued for his arrest, but he avoided apprehension by fleeing into the woods and warning several neighbors, who joined him in taking cover outdoors. Nine years after that, in 1840, Baker was convicted and fined £20 for &quot;having enticed several soldiers to desert from the detachment of the 58th Regiment stationed at Madawaska.&quot;

===Aroostook War===
After the undeclared Aroostook War (1838–39), the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Webster–Ashburton Treaty on August 9, 1842, finally settling the boundary question. One provision of that treaty appears to have applied in effect only to Baker and the estate of his neighbor. 
The region was thus annexed to Canada East (now named Quebec) and following an arbitration period, was awarded to New Brunswick through the New Brunswick Boundary Act of 1851.

<text>Joseph Gallo (April 7, 1929 – April 7, 1972), also known as &quot;Crazy Joe&quot;, was an Italian-American mobster and a &quot;caporegime&quot; in the Colombo crime family of New York City, New York. 

In his youth, Gallo was diagnosed with schizophrenia after an arrest. He soon became an enforcer in the Profaci crime family, later forming his own crew which included his brothers Larry and Albert. In 1957, Joe Profaci allegedly asked Gallo and his crew to murder Albert Anastasia, the boss of what was to become the Gambino crime family; Anastasia was murdered on October 25 at a barber shop in midtown Manhattan. In 1961, the Gallo brothers kidnapped four of Profaci&#x27;s top men: underboss Joseph Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci&#x27;s brother), &quot;caporegime&quot; Salvatore Musacchia and &quot;soldato&quot; John Scimone, demanding a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages&#x27; release. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci and his &quot;consigliere&quot;, Charles &quot;the Sidge&quot; LoCicero, made a deal with the Gallos and secured the peaceful release of the hostages. This incited the First Colombo War.

In 1961, Gallo was convicted of conspiracy and extortion for attempting to extort money from a businessman, and was sentenced to seven-to-fourteen years in prison. While Gallo was imprisoned, Profaci died of cancer in 1962, Magliocco took over, and the Gallo crew attempted to kill Carmine Persico in 1963. Patriarca family boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca negotiated a peace agreement between the two factions, but after Gallo was released from prison on April 11, 1971, he stated that the agreement did not apply to him because he was in prison when it was negotiated. Upon his release, a peace offering of $1,000 was made by boss Joseph Colombo, but Gallo demanded $100,000; Colombo refused. On June 28, 1971, at an Italian-American Civil Rights League rally in Columbus Circle in New York City, Colombo was shot three times by an African-American gunman, who was immediately killed by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards; Colombo survived the shooting but was paralyzed. Although many in the Colombo family blamed Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually concluded that the gunman acted alone after they had questioned Gallo.

The Colombo family leadership was convinced that Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family, inciting the Second Colombo War. On April 7, 1972, around 4:30 a.m., Gallo was shot dead at Umbertos Clam House in New York&#x27;s Little Italy while celebrating his 43rd birthday. Although differing accounts of who the killer or killers were have been reported by various sources over the years, &quot;the case officially remains unsolved&quot;.

==Early life==
Joe Gallo was born in the Red Hook, Brooklyn, area of New York City. His parents were Umberto and Mary Gallo. A bootlegger during Prohibition, Umberto invested his earnings into a loan-sharking racket and did little to discourage his three sons from participating in local criminal activity. 

Although he would remain deeply entwined with South Brooklyn in the popular imagination throughout his criminal career and often frequented the area as a youth because of familial ties, Gallo was actually raised in the borough&#x27;s Kensington section (then customarily characterized as a subsection of Flatbush), where his family owned and operated Jackie&#x27;s Charcolette, a greasy spoon at 108 Beverley Road which capitalized on foot traffic from the nearby Church Avenue business district and IND subway station. As late as 1964, a United States Senate dossier on organized crime identified the family home at 639 East 4th Street as Gallo&#x27;s permanent residence. (By 1972, the Gallo family had relocated across the street to a larger abode at 652 East 4th Street, which was operated as a rooming house.) He completed his primary education at P.S. 179 in Kensington before dropping out of the Brooklyn High School of Automotive Trades in Williamsburg at the age of sixteen.

Shortly thereafter, Gallo sustained head trauma in an automobile accident, resulting in the manifestation of a &quot;nervous tic&quot;; by this juncture, he and lifelong associates Peter &quot;Pete the Greek&quot; Diapoulas and Frank Illiano had begun to contemplate various criminal schemes while frequenting Church Avenue&#x27;s Ace Pool Room and a candy store on 36th Street and Fourteenth Avenue in the nearby Borough Park section. In 1949, after viewing the film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, Gallo began mimicking Richard Widmark&#x27;s gangster character &quot;Tommy Udo&quot; and reciting movie dialogue. After a 1950 arrest, he was temporarily confined to Kings County Hospital Center, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Albert Seedman, the head of New York City Police Department&#x27;s Detective Bureau, called Gallo &quot;that little guy with steel balls&quot;. Gallo&#x27;s brothers, Larry and Albert &quot;Kid Blast&quot; Gallo, were also his criminal associates.

Gallo&#x27;s first wife whom he married around 1960, divorced in the mid-1960s, and then remarried in July 1971 was Las Vegas showgirl Jeffie Lee Boyd. Later in 1971, Jeffie divorced Gallo again. The couple had one daughter, Joie. In March 1972, three weeks before his death, Gallo married 29-year-old actress Sina Essary. He became the stepfather of Sina&#x27;s daughter, Lisa Essary-Gallo (born 1962).

==Early criminal career==
Gallo started as an enforcer and hitman for Joe Profaci in the Profaci crime family. In addition to helping to manage his father&#x27;s loan-sharking business and Larry Gallo&#x27;s vending machine and jukebox operations (with the latter often perceived as the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the family&#x27;s rackets), he directly oversaw a variety of enterprises, including floating dice and high-stakes card games, extortion shakedowns and a numbers game. He maintained his headquarters at &quot;The Dormitory&quot;, a three-story brick tenement at 51 President Street (within the boundaries of Brooklyn&#x27;s contemporary Carroll Gardens) that previously housed the Gallo family&#x27;s vending machine interests; there, he allegedly kept a pet lion named Cleo in the basement. Within a few years, Gallo secretly owned several Manhattan nightclubs and two sweat shops in the Garment District.

In 1957, Profaci allegedly asked Gallo and his crew to murder Albert Anastasia, the boss of the Gambino crime family. Anastasia&#x27;s underboss, Carlo Gambino, wanted to replace him and asked Profaci for assistance. On October 25, Anastasia entered the barber shop at the Park Sheraton Hotel in midtown Manhattan. As Anastasia relaxed in the barber&#x27;s chair, two men—scarves covering their faces—rushed in, shoved the barber out of the way, and killed the Gambino boss in a hail of bullets. Anastasia&#x27;s killers have never been conclusively identified, but Carmine Persico later claimed that he and Gallo had shot Anastasia, joking that he was part of Gallo&#x27;s &quot;barbershop quintet&quot;.

The following year, Gallo and his brothers were summoned to Washington, D.C., to testify before the McClellan Committee of the United States Senate on organized crime. While visiting Senate Counsel Robert F. Kennedy in his office, Gallo flirted with Kennedy&#x27;s secretary and told Kennedy his carpet would be excellent for a dice game. On the witness stand, none of the brothers provided any useful information.

==First Colombo War==
On February 27, 1961, the Gallo brothers kidnapped four of Profaci&#x27;s top men: underboss Joseph Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci&#x27;s brother), &quot;caporegime&quot; Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert sent Joe to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages&#x27; release. Joe wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci and his &quot;consigliere&quot;, Charles &quot;the Sidge&quot; LoCicero, made a deal with the Gallos and secured the peaceful release of the hostages.

However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961, he ordered the murders of Larry Gallo and Joseph &quot;Joe Jelly&quot; Gioielli, a member of the Gallo crew. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioielli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry survived a strangulation attempt by Persico and Salvatore &quot;Sally&quot; D&#x27;Ambrosio at the Sahara Club in East Flatbush after a police officer intervened. The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists; they then began calling Persico &quot;the Snake&quot; after he had betrayed them. The gang war continued, resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory. Persico was indicted later that year for the attempted murder of Larry Gallo, but the charges were dropped when Larry refused to testify.

In November 1961, Gallo was convicted of conspiracy and extortion for attempting to extort money from a businessman. On December 21 of that year, he was sentenced to seven-to-fourteen years in prison.

==Prison==
While serving his sentence, Gallo was incarcerated at three New York state prisons: Green Haven Correctional Facility, Attica Correctional Facility, and Auburn Correctional Facility. 

In 1962, while Gallo was serving time in Attica, his brothers Larry and Albert, along with five other members of the Gallo crew, rushed into a burning Brooklyn tenement near their hangout, the Longshore Rest Room, and rescued six children and their mother from a fire. The crew was briefly celebrated in the press.

While at Green Haven, Gallo became friends with African-American drug trafficker Leroy &quot;Nicky&quot; Barnes. Gallo predicted a power shift in the Harlem drug rackets towards black gangs, and coached Barnes on how to upgrade his criminal organization. On August 29, 1964, Gallo sued the Department of Corrections, stating that correction officers inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on him at Green Haven after he allowed a black barber to cut his hair. The prison commissioner characterized Gallo as a belligerent inmate and an agitator.

At Auburn, Gallo took up watercolor painting and became an avid reader. He worked as an elevator operator in the prison&#x27;s woodworking shop. During a prison riot at Auburn, he rescued a severely wounded corrections officer from angry inmates. The officer later testified for Gallo at a parole hearing. According to Donald Frankos, a fellow inmate at Auburn, Gallo was &quot;articulate and had excellent verbal skills being able to describe gouging a man&#x27;s guts out with the same eloquent ease that he used when discussing classical literature.&quot;

In May 1968, while Gallo was still in prison, his brother Larry died of cancer.

==Release from prison and Second Colombo War==
While Gallo was serving his sentence, big changes were happening in the Profaci family. On June 7, 1962, after a long illness, Profaci died of cancer. Magliocco took over and continued the battle with Gallo&#x27;s brothers. On May 19, 1963, a Gallo hit team shot Persico multiple times, but he survived. In 1963, through negotiations with Patriarca family boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca, a peace agreement was reached between the two factions. Gallo later stated that the peace agreement did not apply to him because he was in prison when it was negotiated.

Later in 1963, The Commission forced Magliocco to resign after the body discovered he helped formulate a plot to overthrow them, and installed Joseph Colombo, an ally of Gambino, as the new Profaci family boss; the Profaci family then became the Colombo crime family. However, Colombo soon alienated Gambino with his establishment of the Italian-American Civil Rights League and the media attention that it entailed.

Gallo was released from prison on April 11, 1971. His second wife, Sina, described him shortly after his release, saying he appeared extremely frail and pale. &quot;He looked like an old man. He was a bag of bones. You could see the remnants of what had been a strikingly handsome man in his youth. He had beautiful features—beautiful nose, beautiful mouth and piercing blue eyes.&quot;

Gallo soon became a part of New York high society. His connection started when actor Jerry Orbach played the inept mobster Kid Sally Palumbo in the 1971 film &quot;The Gang That Couldn&#x27;t Shoot Straight&quot;, a role based loosely on Gallo.

After his release, Colombo and Joseph Yacovelli invited Gallo to a peace meeting with an offering of $1,000. Gallo reportedly told the family representatives that he was not bound by the 1963 peace agreement and demanded $100,000 to settle the dispute, which Colombo refused. On June 28, 1971, at the second League rally in Columbus Circle in Manhattan, Colombo was shot three times, once being in the head, by an African-American gunman named Jerome A. Johnson; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards. Colombo survived the shooting, but was paralyzed until his death in May 1978. Although many in the Colombo family blamed Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually concluded that Johnson was a lone gunman after they had questioned Gallo. The Colombo leadership was convinced that Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family.

==Murder==
On April 7, 1972, around 4:30 a.m., Gallo and his family entered Umbertos Clam House in Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy to celebrate his 43rd birthday with sister Carmella, wife Sina, her daughter Lisa, his bodyguard Peter &quot;Pete the Greek&quot; Diapoulas, and Diapoulas&#x27; girlfriend. Earlier that evening, the Gallo party had visited the Copacabana with Jerry Orbach and his wife, Marta, to see a performance by comedian Don Rickles and singer Peter Lemongello. Once at Umbertos, the Gallo party took two tables, with Gallo and Diapoulas facing the wall. Rickles and Lemongello, whom Gallo had invited to join them at Umbertos, managed to find an excuse to get out of the engagement, possibly saving their lives.

Colombo associate Joseph Luparelli claimed he was sitting at the bar, unbeknownst to Gallo. When Luparelli saw Gallo, he claimed he immediately left Umbertos and walked to a Colombo hangout two blocks away. After contacting Yacovelli, Luparelli said he recruited Colombo associate Philip Gambino, Genovese soldier Carmine &quot;Sonny Pinto&quot; DiBiase, and two other men reputedly members of the Patriarca family to kill Gallo due to their belief the Colombo family had a contract on Gallo&#x27;s life. Upon reaching Umbertos, Luparelli claimed he stayed in the car while the other four men went inside through the back door. Between seafood courses, Luparelli asserted that the four gunmen walked into the dining room and opened fire with .32- and .38 caliber revolvers. Gallo swore and attempted to draw his handgun, but twenty shots were fired at him and he was hit in the back, elbow and buttock. After overturning a butcher block dining table, Gallo staggered to the front door. Witnesses claimed that he was attempting to draw fire away from his family. Diapoulas was shot once in the hip. The mortally wounded Gallo stumbled into the street and collapsed. He was taken in a police car to Beekman-Downtown Hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after, around 5:30 a.m.

Luparelli&#x27;s account earned wide publicity, but was met with skepticism by police. NYPD homicide detective Joe Coffey, who inherited the Gallo case from original investigators, reported that based on eyewitness testimony and crime scene reconstruction police always believed the Gallo shooter was a lone man. Coffey also asserted that police circulated a false story about three shooters to help screen information from supposed witnesses or informers: anyone who reported three gunmen rather than one was immediately deemed unreliable. Author Charles Brandt notes that &quot;[Luparelli&#x27;s] statement was never corroborated in a single detail&quot; and resulted in no arrests. Brandt further speculates that Luparalli&#x27;s confession was most likely disinformation ordered by his Colombo family superiors intended to defuse tensions after the Gallo shooting. Umbertos was owned by associates of the Genovese crime family, which would normally imply the Genovese family had given their blessing to a killing on their territory, but Luparelli&#x27;s account, that the shooting was a spontaneous unplanned act without approval from high-ranking &quot;mafiosi&quot;, took pressure off the feuding Colombo and Genovese families.

A differing but equally disputed account of the murder was offered by Frank Sheeran, a hitman and labor union boss. Shortly before his death in 2003, Sheeran claimed that he was the lone triggerman in the Gallo hit acting on orders from mobster Russell Bufalino, who felt that Gallo was drawing undue attention with his flashy lifestyle. Coffey and several other New York police officers are confident that Sheeran killed Gallo. Furthermore, an eyewitness at Umbertos on the night of the incident, later a &quot;New York Times&quot; editor who spoke on condition of anonymity, also identified Sheeran as the man she observed shooting Gallo. Jerry Capeci, a journalist and Mafia expert who was at Umbertos shortly after the shooting as a young reporter for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, later wrote if he were &quot;forced to make a choice&quot; about who shot Gallo, Sheeran was the most likely culprit. Bill Tonelli disputes the truthfulness of Sheeran&#x27;s claim in his &quot;Slate&quot; article &quot;The Lies of the Irishman&quot;, as does Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith in &quot;Jimmy Hoffa and &#x27;The Irishman&#x27;: A True Crime Story?&quot; which appeared in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Former Colombo family capo Michael Franzese, also disputes that Sheeran was the killer when reviewing the scene depicting the assassination in &quot;The Irishman&quot;, claiming that he knows &quot;for a fact what happened there&quot; based on his personal involvement with the Mafia at the time. Gallo&#x27;s widow later stated that she remembered the attack involving multiple men, all of whom were short and appeared to be Italian. Sheeran, on the other hand, was of mixed Irish-Swedish descent and 6&#x27;4&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Gallo&#x27;s funeral was held under police surveillance; his sister Carmella declared over his open coffin that &quot;the streets are going to run red with blood, Joey!&quot; Looking for revenge, Albert Gallo sent a gunman from Las Vegas to the Neapolitan Noodle restaurant in Manhattan, where Yacovelli, Alphonse Persico, and Gennaro Langella were dining. However, the gunman did not recognize the mobsters and shot four innocent diners instead, killing two of them. After this assassination attempt, Yacovelli fled New York, leaving Persico as the new boss. The Colombo family, led by the imprisoned Persico, was plunged into a second internecine war which lasted for several years, until a 1974 agreement allowed Albert and his remaining crew to join the Genovese family.

An increasingly paranoid Luparelli fled to California, then contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reached a deal to become a government witness. He then implicated the four gunmen in the Gallo murder. However, the police could not bring charges against them; there was no corroborating evidence and Luparelli was deemed an unreliable witness. No one was ever charged in Gallo&#x27;s murder.

In October 1975, the New York City Department of Water Resources began to replace the sewer on the &quot;Gallo block&quot; of President Street (between Columbia and Van Brunt Streets) with a system designed to connect to a new sewage treatment plant in Red Hook. When a house at 21 President Street collapsed on December 3, 1975 (resulting in the death of one man), all work on the project stopped for more than eighteen months, leaving an &quot;open trench in the middle of the street [...] braced with steel and filled with stagnant water&quot; due to an ensuing pump failure; this compromised the foundations of every building on the block and the remaining buildings on an adjoining stretch of Carroll Street, compounding the effects of probable earlier damage stemming from the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and the depressed alignment of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway on nearby Hicks Street. Gallo crew member Frank DiMatteo has speculated that &quot;lawyers and corrupt politicians [...] decided to turn the whole block into a stinking shithole until no one could live there anymore&quot; in an effort to rid the area — by now convenient to the gentrifying enclaves of Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill — of remaining Gallo associates. According to DiMatteo, only four buildings on the block were owned by the Gallo crew: &quot;The rest were all owned by innocent people who&#x27;d had those buildings in their families for generations. [...] The Law didn&#x27;t care. They got what they wanted.&quot; As many as 33 buildings on the block were subsequently condemned and replaced with new housing, with none of the Gallo-era buildings extant today.

==In popular culture==
Author Jimmy Breslin&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;The Gang That Couldn&#x27;t Shoot Straight&quot; was a fictionalized and satirical depiction of Gallo&#x27;s war with the Profaci family. It was made into a 1971 feature film with Jerry Orbach playing Kid Sally Palumbo, a surrogate for Gallo. 

After Gallo&#x27;s murder, producer Dino De Laurentiis produced a more serious, but still fictionalized drama about Gallo titled &quot;Crazy Joe&quot;, released in 1974. Based on newspaper articles by reporter Nicholas Gage, the movie was directed by Carlo Lizzani and starred Peter Boyle as the title character.

Gallo is the main character in Bob Dylan&#x27;s biographical, 12-verse ballad &quot;Joey&quot;. The song appears in Dylan&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Desire&quot;. Dylan was criticized for overly romanticizing his life in the song. 

Gallo was portrayed by Sebastian Maniscalco in the 2019 Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Irishman&quot;.

Gallo is portrayed in the 2019 film &quot;Mob Town&quot; by Kyle Stefanski.

In the Paramount+ 2022 TV Series &quot;The Offer&quot;, Gallo is portrayed by Joseph Russo.

<text>A Ukrainophone (, &quot;ukrainskomovnyi&quot;) is a person who speaks the Ukrainian language either natively or by preference. At the same time the term is used in a more specialized meaning to describe the category of people whose cultural background is associated with the Ukrainian language regardless of territorial distinctions.

There are an estimated 41 million native speakers of Ukrainian worldwide (of whom 37.5 million or 91% live in Ukraine).

There are many Ukrainophone communities in neighbouring countries with Ukraine, due to the historical spread of ethnic Ukrainian populations in areas that later became a part of those states, including Belarus, Moldova (especially Transnistria), Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, as well as in continental nations and areas where Ukrainians had moved to in recent centuries or were deported to during the Soviet regime, such as Kazakhstan, the Far East, Sakhalin, Kuril Islands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Portugal, the U.K., etc. Additionally, there are large Ukrainophone immigrant communities in various parts of Canada, the United States (especially New York City, Baltimore) and Australia, and somewhat smaller communities in various nations of Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela.

==Ukraine==
According to Article 10 of Ukraine&#x27;s constitution, Ukrainian is the country&#x27;s only official language and the state ensures its comprehensive development and functioning in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. 

According to the 2001 census, 67.5% of the population of Ukraine considered Ukrainian their native tongue, which is 2.8% more than in 1989 and 5.5% less than in 1959. Additionally, 42,374,848 residents of Ukraine (87.8% of the population) declared fluency in Ukrainian, including 97% of Ukrainians, 95% of Poles, over 60% of Jews, Belarusians and Romani, and over 50% of Russians, Greeks, Moldovans, and Armenians. The lowest level of Ukrainian language proficiency was recorded among Crimean Tatars (20%), Bulgarians (42%), and Romanians (44%).

After the 1989–1991 Ukrainian revolution and independence restoration in 1991, a policy of Ukrainisation began. The policy was weakened and attempts were made to cancel it altogether by the government of Viktor Yanukovych in 2010-2014. The 2012 significantly weakened the positions of Ukrainian and granted regional language status to Russian and several other minority languages. Ukrainisation got a new lease of life after the Revolution of Dignity and the beginning of the war in Donbas. The 2019 Law of Ukraine &quot;On protecting the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language&quot; played an important role in cementing the status of Ukrainian as the main language in the Ukrainian state, enshrining the priority and compulsory use of Ukrainian in some areas of public life. Ukrainian significantly strengthened its position in society following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Other countries==

===Europe===
====Belarus====

According to the 1999 Belarusian census, Ukrainian as a native language was indicated by 42.9% of the Ukrainians of the Republic of Belarus, who according to the same census numbered 237 thousand.

According to the 2009 Belarusian census, Ukrainian was the native language for 51,039 people (0.54% of the country&#x27;s population, 3rd place after Belarusian and Russian). Ukrainians among those who indicated Ukrainian as their native language were 46,403 (29.2% of the total Ukrainian population of the republic), and representatives of other nationalities — 4,636. Those speaking it at home made up 6,279.

According to the 2019 Belarusian census, the number of people who indicated Ukrainian as their mother tongue increased to 55,020 (0.58% of the country&#x27;s population, 3rd place). Ukrainians among those who indicated Ukrainian as their native language were 46,386 (29.1% of the total Ukrainian population of the republic), and representatives of other nationalities — 8,634. The number of those speaking it at home increased to 8,055.

====Moldova====

According to the 2004 Moldovan census, Ukrainian was the native language of 186,394 people (5.51% of the country&#x27;s population, 4th place after Moldovan, Romanian, and Russian). 130,114 people (3.85% of the population of the Republic of Moldova) indicated that they usually speak Ukrainian.

According to the 2014 Moldovan census, the number of people who indicated Ukrainian as their mother tongue decreased to 107,252 (3.82% of the country&#x27;s population, 5th place after Moldovan, Romanian, Russian, and Gagauz), and the number of people who frequently speak Ukrainian decreased to 73,802 (2.63% of the country&#x27;s population).

====Romania====

According to the 2002 Romanian census, 57,407 people (0.26% of Romania&#x27;s population, 4th place after Romanian, Hungarian, and Roma) indicated Ukrainian as their mother tongue, of whom 33,506 were residents of the Maramureș County and 8,497 of the Suceava County.

According to the 2011 Romanian census, the number of people who indicated Ukrainian as their mother tongue decreased to 48,910 (0.24% of the country&#x27;s population, 4th place), of whom 30,548 were residents of the Maramureș County and 6,097 of the Suceava County.

According to the 2021 Romanian census, the number of people who indicated Ukrainian as their mother tongue decreased to 40,861 (0.21% of the country&#x27;s population, 4th place), of whom 25,446 were residents of the Maramureș County and 5,822 of the Suceava County.

====Russia====
According to the 2002 Russian census, 1,400,576 or 47.59% of Ukrainians in the Russian Federation indicated that they can speak languages other than Russian, of whom 1,267,207 indicated that they could speak Ukrainian. The total number of people who reported being able to speak Ukrainian was 1,815,210 (5th place after Russian, English, Tatar, and German).

According to the 2010 Russian census, the number of people who reported being able to speak Ukrainian decreased to 1,129,838. Additionally, 499,466 people identified Ukrainian as their mother tongue.

According to the 2021 Russian census, which was also conducted in the Russian-annexed Crimea, the number of those who reported speaking Ukrainian decreased to 627,106 (9th place). Those who reported using it in everyday life were 208,854 (23rd place). 294,952 reported that Ukrainian was their native language (21st place).

===Americas===

====Brazil====

Although most Brazilian Ukrainians have lived in Brazil for 4-5 generations and few have ever seen Ukraine, they have preserved their language and culture to a large degree in rural Paraná state. This has largely been due to the colossal efforts of the Ukrainian Churches. In contrast, among the Ukrainians in Argentina where the Church was not as strong as in Brazil, the Ukrainian language has largely disappeared. Among those who live in the colonies, or agricultural settlements, Ukrainian is widely spoken at home, in church, and the community, and today it is not uncommon for Ukrainian children to be unable to speak the Portuguese language until they begin school. Despite the Ukrainian language&#x27;s widespread use in everyday speech, the ability to read and write is more limited, with over 50% of the Ukrainian population being unable to write in the Ukrainian language. Due to isolation from Ukraine, the Ukrainians of Brazil speak a 100-year-old form of the language&#x27;s Galician or &quot;Upper Dniestrian&quot; dialect. Ninety percent of Church services are conducted in the Ukrainian language (in contrast, among the 700,000 ethnic Poles in Brazil only two churches use the Polish language). The Portuguese language has only come into wide use in the youngest generation — those who are younger than fifteen years old. The situation in urban areas is quite different. In the cities, Ukrainians tend to become assimilated into Brazilian culture and adopt the Portuguese language.

====Canada====

In Canada the term Ukrainophone is also used to differentiate Ukrainian language-speakers from ethnically Ukrainian Canadians in general. It refers to speakers of both the local Canadian Ukrainian dialect and Standard Ukrainian.

Most Ukrainian Canadians are assimilated to the North American majority and speak English. In the nomenclature of Canadian and Quebec language politics, this makes them Anglophones, but some Ukrainian Canadians may also be Francophones (French-speakers). If Ukrainian is a person&#x27;s mother tongue then they are considered &quot;allophone&quot; (neither English- nor French-speaking). Therefore, a Ukrainophone in Quebec is also an allophone.

====United States====

The overwhelming majority of Ukrainophones in the United States reside in select areas of New York City and Baltimore, MD. In 2018 the number of Ukrainian diaspora in the US reached 1 million.

<text>King County Metro, officially the King County Metro Transit Department and often shortened to Metro, is the public transit authority of King County, Washington, which includes the city of Seattle. It is the eighth-largest transit bus agency in the United States. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . Metro employs 2,477 full-time and part-time operators and operates 1,540 buses.

King County Metro formally began operations on January 1, 1973, but can trace its roots to the Seattle Transit System, founded in 1939, and Overlake Transit Service, a private operator founded in 1927 to serve the Eastside. Metro is also contracted to operate and maintain Sound Transit&#x27;s 1 Line Link light rail line and eight of the agency&#x27;s Sound Transit Express bus routes along with the Seattle Streetcar lines owned by the City of Seattle. Metro&#x27;s services include electric trolleybuses in Seattle, RapidRide enhanced buses on eight lines, commuter routes along the regional freeway system, dial-a-ride routes, paratransit services, and overnight “owl” bus routes.

==History==

A horse-drawn streetcar rail system debuted in Seattle in 1884 as the Seattle Street Railway. In 1918, the city of Seattle bought many parts of the Seattle Street Railway, on terms which left the transit operation in financial trouble.

In 1939, a new transportation agency, the Seattle Transit System, was formed, which refinanced the remaining debt and began replacing equipment with &quot;trackless trolleys&quot; (as they were known) and motor buses. The final streetcar ran on April 13, 1941.

The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle was created by a local referendum on September 9, 1958, as a regional authority tasked with management of wastewater and water quality issues in King County. The authority was formed after civic leaders, including those in the Municipal League, noted that solutions to regional issues were complicated by local boundaries and a plethora of existing special districts. The state legislature approved the formation of a combined transportation, sewage, and planning authority in 1957, but the countywide referendum was rejected by a majority outside of Seattle. Metro, as the authority came to be called, was restricted to sewage management and given a smaller suburban jurisdiction ahead of the successful September referendum. By 1967, the agency had completed its $125 million sewage treatment system, which diverted 20 million gallons ( million liters) that had previously contaminated Lake Washington.

After two failed attempts to enable it to build a regional rapid transit system, it was authorized to operate a regional bus system in 1972. The bus system was known as Metro Transit and began operations on January 1, 1973. Its operations subsumed the Seattle Transit System, formerly under the purview of the City of Seattle and the Metropolitan Transit Corporation, a private company serving suburban cities in King County. In the early 1970s, the private Metropolitan faced bankruptcy because of low ridership. King County voters authorized Metro to buy Metropolitan and operate the county&#x27;s mass transit bus system. Metro Transit introduced its new services in September 1973, including a ride-free area in downtown and express routes on freeways (known as &quot;Flyer&quot; routes), and a unified numbering scheme in 1977 that replaced named routes. The agency introduced its first paratransit service in 1979, which was followed by buses equipped with wheelchair lifts in 1980.

The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle was overseen by a federated board of elected officials, composed of elected officials from cities throughout the region. Its representation structure was ruled unconstitutional in 1990 on the grounds of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; following a similar ruling in &quot;Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris&quot;. In 1992, after gaining approval by popular vote, the municipality&#x27;s roles and authorities were assumed by the government of King County. The municipality&#x27;s transit operations was a stand-alone department within the county until 1996, when it became a division of the newly created King County Department of Transportation. In August 2018, the county council approved legislation to separate Metro from the Department of Transportation, creating the King County Metro Transit Department effective January 1, 2019.

After completion of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel project in 1990, attention was drawn again to developing a regional rail system. This interest led to the formation of the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (more commonly known as Sound Transit) which holds primary responsibility for planning and building high capacity transit in the counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish, in western Washington state. Metro was contracted to operate Sound Transit&#x27;s major light rail line, now the 1 Line of the Link light rail system, and several routes on its Sound Transit Express network. The transit tunnel was owned and operated by Metro until it was transferred to Sound Transit in 2022. Metro also operates two streetcar routes in Seattle under contract with Seattle Streetcar.

===Ride Free Area===
For almost 40 years, until 2012, most of downtown Seattle was designated as a zero-fare zone, an area in which all rides on Metro vehicles were free, known as the &quot;Ride Free&quot; Area. Intended to encourage transit usage, improve accessibility and encourage downtown shopping, the zone was created in September 1973 and was originally called the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; zone. It was later renamed the Ride Free Area (RFA). The RFA extended from the north at Battery St. to S. Jackson St. on the south and east at 6th Avenue to the waterfront on the west. Until 1987, the zone was in effect 24 hours a day, but in October of that year Metro began requiring fare payment within the zone during night-time hours, between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., to reduce fare-related conflicts that sometimes led to assaults on drivers; in February 1994, the RFA&#x27;s hours were reduced further, with fare payment required between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.

A King County Auditor&#x27;s Office report released in September 2009 found that Metro &quot;can neither fully explain nor provide backup documentation for the operating cost savings that offset the fare revenues in the calculation of the annual charges to the City of Seattle for the city&#x27;s Ride Free Area&quot; and that some assumptions in the methodology Metro used to calculate the amount of lost fares were &quot;questionable&quot; and have not been updated to reflect changes to the fare structure and fare collection methods.

A 1975 study found that while the Ride Free Area generally reduced bus travel times within the RFA itself, buses that traveled through the Ride Free Area to other destinations generally did not benefit. It also found that unloading outbound coaches once outside the RFA took additional time, though not entirely quantified vis-à-vis time saved within the RFA.

On September 29, 2012, the Ride Free Area was eliminated. All riders boarding in downtown must now pay as they board.

==Operations==
===Routes===
Metro has 139 bus routes that combine service patterns typical of both city and suburban bus networks, carrying over 280,000 daily passengers . The agency&#x27;s ridership peaked at 425,000 daily passengers in October 2015. The city network was descended in large part from the Seattle Transit system of converted streetcar routes. Most service is operated in a hub-and-spoke pattern centered either on downtown Seattle or the University of Washington, with lesser amounts of crosstown service. The suburban network typically operates on major streets between the regions employment and population centers.

Routes in the city network are numbered from 1 to 99. Because of the scattershot evolution of the system, there is no easily discernible pattern to the route numbers, although there are clusters in certain neighborhoods. Suburban routes follow a numbering system: 100–199 for South King County, 200–299 for the Eastside, 300–399 for North King County, and 900–999 for dial-a-ride and custom routes.

The in-city routes with the highest ridership are the RapidRide D Line from downtown to Crown Hill via Uptown/Seattle Center and Ballard; the 7, traveling from downtown through the International District to the Rainier Valley; the 40, traveling from downtown through South Lake Union, Fremont, and Ballard to Northgate; the RapidRide C Line from South Lake Union and downtown to West Seattle&#x27;s Alaska Junction and Westwood Village; the 36, traveling from downtown through the International District to Beacon Hill; the 5 from downtown via the Woodland Park Zoo and Greenwood/Phinney Ridge to Shoreline Community College; the 44, a crosstown route connecting the University District and Ballard; the 8, a crosstown route connecting Uptown/Seattle Center and South Lake Union with Capitol Hill, the Central District and Mount Baker; and the 70, connecting downtown to South Lake Union, Eastlake, and the University District.

The Metro-operated Seattle Streetcar routes are numbered in the 90s, with the South Lake Union Streetcar numbered 98 and the former bus replacement for the Waterfront Streetcar numbered 99.

The suburban system is more numerically organized. Roughly speaking, areas in South King County (from Burien and Des Moines through Renton and Maple Valley) are served by routes numbered in the 100s, areas in East King County (from Renton to Bothell) are served by routes numbered in the 200s, areas in North King County (from Bothell to Shoreline) are served by routes numbered in the 300s. The Metro-operated Sound Transit Express routes are numbered in the 500s.

Route numbers in the lower 900s (901–931) are used for Dial-a-Ride services, while shuttles connecting to the King County Water Taxi are numbered in the 700s. The dial-a-ride system is contracted to Hopelink, a non-profit organization. Since 2003, Metro has contracted with senior charities to operate the Hyde Shuttle system, which provides free rides to elderly or disabled passengers in Seattle and other cities. Metro formerly funded a shuttle system named Ride2 that served West Seattle and Eastgate using contracted private buses, which ended in 2019. A set of three shuttle van services contracted out to private operators, including Via in the Rainier Valley, Community Ride, and Ride Pingo in Kent, were launched starting in 2019. They were merged in 2023 under the &quot;Metro Flex&quot; brand with a shared livery.

Metro is contracted to operate special custom buses. Custom routes that serve schools in Bellevue and on Mercer Island are numbered in the 800s (823, 824, 886–892) and routes serving the private Lakeside School and University Prep numbered in the higher 900s (980–995). Metro also operates custom routes to major employment sites (like Group Health Cooperative in Tukwila and the Boeing Everett Factory). Custom routes are also occasionally established to serve as shuttles for large local events, including Seattle Seahawks and Washington Huskies football games.

Since 2008, Metro has maintained an Emergency Snow Network plan to be implemented during major snowstorms and other periods of inclement weather. The network uses only 67 routes on high-frequency corridors with flat topography to compensate for a reduced number of drivers and workers. Several routes were also split between trunk routes using articulated buses and shuttles to serve hillier areas with smaller buses. The network plan was first implemented during the February 2019 snowstorm. In August 2019, the King County Council voted to waive transit fares during snow emergencies. An earlier plan from the 1980s replaced Seattle–Eastside commuter routes with a set of routes that exclusively served predetermined park and ride lots.

===RapidRide===
King County Metro operates RapidRide, a network of limited-stop bus lines with some bus rapid transit features. All RapidRide routes have frequent service with frequencies of 10 minutes or better during peak commuting hours and 15 minutes during most off-peak hours and on weekends. Most lines (except the B and F lines) have late night and early morning service. Stops are placed farther apart than typical Metro service to increase speed and reliability. Stops with heavier ridership have &quot;stations&quot; with an awning, seating, lighting, real time information signs to communicate estimate arrival times of RapidRide buses. Most stations and some stops in Downtown Seattle have ORCA card readers that allow passengers to pay before the bus arrives and board at any of the buses&#x27; three doors. All lines use new, low-floor, articulated buses that are painted with a distinct red and yellow livery and have onboard Wi-Fi.

The RapidRide corridors are:
* A Line: Tukwila – Federal Way
* B Line: Redmond – Overlake – Bellevue
* C Line: West Seattle – Downtown Seattle – South Lake Union
* D Line: Ballard – Uptown – Downtown Seattle
* E Line: Shoreline – Downtown Seattle
* F Line: Burien – Southcenter – Renton
* G Line: Madison Valley – Downtown Seattle
* H Line: Burien – White Center – West Seattle – Downtown Seattle

===Freeway express services===
Metro operates many peak-hour commuter routes serving park and rides that use 244.52 miles of the region&#x27;s network of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. This practice was pioneered at Seattle Transit as the &quot;Blue Streak&quot; express bus service running between Northgate Park &amp; Ride and Downtown Seattle. Special stops called &quot;freeway flyers&quot; or freeway stations were constructed to allow efficient transfer between local and express buses. The first freeway flyer stop opened in 1975 at Montlake Boulevard and State Route 520. Metro also takes advantage of new HOV direct-access ramps and freeway stations constructed by Sound Transit to improve speed and reliability of its commuter routes.

===Skip-stop spacing===
Metro uses skip-stop spacing on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Avenues in Downtown Seattle, whereby buses skip every other bus stop. On 3rd Avenue, each bus route is assigned to Blue, Yellow, Red or Green stop groups and each bus stop has two color designations; in the northbound direction, every other bus stop is a Red/Yellow or Green/Blue stop, while in the southbound direction they are Green/Yellow and Red/Blue. On 2nd and 4th Avenues, routes are grouped into Orange and White stops. The bus stop color groupings are identified by a colored plate installed above or on the side of the bus stop sign. On 3rd Avenue only, there are additional colored markers one block ahead of each bus stop on the trolley overhead wires, to help bus drivers identify the colors of the upcoming bus stop.

=== Night Owl services ===
Metro operates a network of 13 routes with late-night &quot;Night Owl&quot; service, which is defined as having regular service between midnight and 5 am. The Night Owl network is made up of some of Metro&#x27;s most popular routes, and is designed to connect neighborhoods with major transportation hubs including downtown Seattle, Sea–Tac Airport, park &amp; ride lots, transit centers, and Link stations (providing service during the hours when trains are not in service). The City of Seattle&#x27;s transportation benefit district funds service on Night Owl routes that operate entirely within the city limits.

Routes with Night Owl service include the 7, 36, 48, 49, 124, 160, 161, and the RapidRide A, C, D, E, G and H Lines.

===Trailhead Direct===

King County Metro contracts with Hopelink to operate a weekend express shuttle between Seattle and hiking areas in the Cascade foothills called Trailhead Direct from April to October. The service, operated in partnership with the county&#x27;s park and recreation department and private companies, is intended to relieve parking issues at popular trailheads at peak times. It debuted in 2017 and was expanded the following year to cover three routes: Capitol Hill station to Mount Si; Mount Baker station to the Issaquah Alps; and a shuttle from North Bend to Mailbox Peak. A fourth route, between Tukwila International Boulevard station, Renton, and Cougar Mountain, was added in 2019. The service was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and returned in 2021 with only two routes. Due to staffing issues, service to the Issaquah Alps was suspended for the 2022 and 2023 seasons but returned in 2024.

==Fares==

King County Metro has had a flat rate fare structure for all riders since July 2018. The flat rate of $2.75 for adults and $1 for senior, disabled and qualified low-income passengers replaced a previous system with two zones—divided between Seattle and the rest of the county—and peak period surcharges. A separate rate of $1.50 was levied for youth passengers and ORCA Lift low-income passholders until September 2022; the ORCA Lift rate was lowered to $1 and the youth fare was eliminated as part of a statewide program.

Fares can be paid using cash, a paper transfer, the e-purse or passes on ORCA cards, or the Transit Go smartphone app. Monthly and daily passes are available for ORCA cards, including the PugetPass and inter-agency regional passes. From 2020 to 2025, the inspection of fares by Metro personnel was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and later changes in county policy to address racial bias. The resumed fare inspection program consists of uniformed inspectors who board buses and request identification from non-paying passengers; a previous misdemeanor charge for four instances of non-payment was removed.

The King County Metro fares as of September 1, 2022 are:
=== Fare history ===

Metro Transit initially had 38 fare zones that it inherited from its two predecessor operators, with a surcharge of 10 cents per zone crossing. The fare system was overhauled in 1977 and simplified to two zones: one within Seattle and one for the rest of the county. The fare change also introduced a one-hour pass for free transfers—either within the same hour or for a return trip on the same route—and monthly passes.

One-way fare (Peak, 1 Zone), with year of rate change:

*1973: 20¢
*1977: 30¢
*1979: 40¢
*1980: 50¢
*1982: 60¢ 
*1985: 65¢

*1989: 75¢
*1991: $1.00
*1993: $1.10 
*1998: $1.25
*2001: $1.50 
*2008: $1.75

*2009: $2.00
*2010: $2.25
*2012: $2.50
*2015: $2.75
*2018: $2.75 
== Facilities ==
=== Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel ===

A major Metro facility is the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT), a 1.3-mile-long, four-station tunnel that allows Central Link light rail trains to travel under the heart of downtown Seattle. It formerly carried bus traffic alongside light rail trains, stopping at a fifth station in the north and connecting to the SODO Busway in the south.

The tunnel was completed in 1990, at a cost of $455 million, to carry commuter buses. While it was planned from the outset to be convertible to use by trains, the tunnel began operation with a fleet of 236 Breda dual-mode buses that operated using a diesel motor on city streets and an electric motor (with power fed by overhead trolley wire) in the tunnel. In 2004, Metro switched to hybrid-electric buses that operate in a mostly electric &quot;hush mode&quot; while in the tunnel.

The tunnel was closed between fall 2005 and fall 2007 to prepare it for light rail trains. Crews lowered the roadway to match the height of Central Link&#x27;s low-floor light rail vehicles, replaced the overhead trolley wire with catenary wire, and built a stub tunnel where trains could reverse direction and allowed for construction of the University Link extension to the north (which was completed in 2016). The tunnel finished its retrofit and returned to service on September 24, 2007 and light rail trains began service on July 18, 2009.

Bus service in the tunnel ended on March 23, 2019, as part of the demolition of Convention Place station to prepare for an expansion of the Washington State Convention Center. The project severed access to the north portal of the tunnel, while an upcoming light rail construction project in 2020 will also cause other disruptions. The tunnel is now exclusively used by light rail trains, and its ownership is planned to be transferred to Sound Transit in 2022.

===Transit centers===
While Downtown Seattle is Metro&#x27;s main transit hub, transit centers act as smaller regional hubs and are served by many bus routes. Some transit centers also offer a park and ride facility. Metro operates out of several transit centers located throughout King County, some of which are shared with Sound Transit and other county agencies.

===Park and ride lots===

In King County, Metro has 132 park and ride facilities containing a total of 24,524 parking stalls . Half of the lots are leased from other property owners such as churches.

Metro began developing its park and rides in the 1970s using various funding sources, including federal grants. By 1988, it had 37 lots across King County, mostly concentrated on the Eastside, and monitored property crimes with a team of four police officers and hired guards. In the 1980s, Metro proposed co-locating its park and rides with commercial developments to encourage transit-oriented development and attract more riders. In the 2000s, Metro opened its first park and ride garages as well as several lots that were integrated with housing and retail developments.

=== Operations bases and facilities ===
Metro stores and maintains buses at seven bases (garages), spread throughout its operating area. In addition to the bases, maintenance of the fleet and operation of the system are supported by several other facilities.

==Security==

The Metro Transit Police Department is a unit of the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office that provides security and law enforcement onboard Metro buses and at the agency&#x27;s facilities. , it has 65 officers out of 79 budgeted positions. Metro also contracts with private firms to provide uniformed security guards. Following the 2024 stabbing of an operator in the University District, Metro proposed the adoption of separate compartments for bus drivers in newer buses that are scheduled to arrive in 2026. The existing sneeze guards installed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic are planned to be replaced on most buses with a more solid barrier.

==Funding==

The adopted 2025 budget for King County allocated $2.12billion to Metro for operating and capital expenses related to its transit services. These include non-Metro services that the agency operates on behalf of other agencies. King County Metro is the sole metropolitan county transit agency in Washington and is authorized by the state legislature to collect a sales tax of 0.9percent across King County. Prior to the 1999 approval of Initiative 695, the agency also collected a motor vehicle excise tax from the state government. The sales tax is Metro&#x27;s primary funding source, comprising 55.8percent of anticipated revenue in 2025, followed by payments from Sound Transit. The agency derives approximately 9percent of its revenue from fares.

Bus advertising, primarily in the form of vehicle wraps and banners, comprises a portion of Metro&#x27;s revenue. The agency prohibits the sale of advertising space for political campaigns and public or social issues. The policy was challenged as a violation of freedom of speech by organizations that had their requests to advertise on Metro buses rejected. A 2016 lawsuit from the American Freedom Defense Initiative was decided in Metro&#x27;s favor by the Ninth Circuit of Appeals and was declined to be heard by the United States Supreme Court.

===Operating costs===
The cost per boarding for Metro was $4.10 in 2005, compared to $2.50 among the country&#x27;s 15 largest transit agencies and $2.97, the national average. Metro&#x27;s cost per boarding is 38% above the national average.

Metro&#x27;s higher-than-average cost per boarding can be at least partially attributed to its high percentage of commuter routes, which run at peak hours only, and often only in one direction at a time. As of 2011, 100 of Metro&#x27;s 223 routes are peak-only. These routes require significant deadheading (particularly on the one-way routes), as well as a very large part-time labor force, both of which drive up costs.

Metro&#x27;s lowest-cost route overall, route 4 (East Queen Anne to Judkins Park), had a cost per boarding of only $0.46 during peak hours in 2009. By way of contrast, Metro&#x27;s peak-only route with the lowest cost per boarding was route 206 (Newport Hills to International School), at $2.04. Metro&#x27;s highest cost route by this measure, route 149 (Renton Transit Center to Black Diamond), had a peak time cost of $34.47 per boarding. Route 149 serves the rural southeastern corner of King County.

In 2007 it cost $3.64 per boarding to deliver service in the West (Seattle) subarea, $4.79 in the South subarea and $7.27 in the East subarea of King County. At the end of 2008, the systemwide cost per boarding was $3.70.

===Transit Now===
In April 2006, King County Executive Ron Sims announced a program entitled &quot;Transit Now&quot; that provided for a 20 percent increase in transit service by the end of 2016 over 2006 service levels, measured in annual operating hours. In order to realize this growth, Transit Now proposed an increase in the local option sales tax for transit of one-tenth of one percent. The Transit Now ordinance, passed by the King County Council on September 5, 2006, and signed by Executive Sims on September 11, 2006, forwarded the tax proposition to the voters and identified the programs to which operating revenue generated from the sales tax increase could be appropriated. The measure was approved by 56.62% of King County voters in the November 2007 general election. The service programs identified in the ordinance are as follows:

# Implementation of RapidRide routes in five arterial corridors.
# Increase service on high-ridership routes that provide frequent, two-way connections throughout the agency&#x27;s service area.
# Service for growing areas in outlying suburban/[exurban] areas.
# Partnerships with cities and major employers to provide more service than could otherwise be provided through typical resources.
# Additional improvements such as expanded ride-share and paratransit services in King County.

=== Seattle Proposition 1 (2014) ===
In November 2014, Seattle voters passed Proposition 1 with 59% support. It uses $45 million in new annual funds from a 0.1% sales tax raise and a $60 annual car-tab fee to add King County Metro bus service within the City of Seattle.

==Technology==
Collaborating with several local jurisdictions, Metro was an early adopter of Transit Signal Priority (TSP), a system that can extend green lights to allow buses to get through. The system can boost average speeds as much as 8% and is in use on several of the city&#x27;s busiest corridors, including Aurora Avenue North, Rainier Avenue S and Lake City Way NE. The system uses RFID tags that are read as buses approach a TSP equipped intersection. In 1998, the fleet was updated with an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system that utilizes battery-powered beacons that read the RFID tags and communicate the buses&#x27; location to Metro.

In 2010, the AVL system was replaced with a GPS-based system as part of a system-wide radio update. As a part of the radio update Metro also added automated next stop signs and announcements to all buses.

In 2010, Metro rolled out a new IP network based ITS infrastructure for its RapidRide service. Buses will communicate with roadside equipment using 802.11 wireless technology on the 4.9 GHz public safety band. A fiber optic backhaul connects access points and roadside equipment together to Metro&#x27;s Communication Center. The system will extend the legacy RFID-based TSP system. It will also be used in conjunction with GPS technology to provide frequent and accurate location updates for next bus arrival signs at RapidRide stations.

The extent of Metro&#x27;s application of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for transit information available for customers has been limited to a few projects: 
* An early project called MyBus by the University of Washington (UW) utilized the tracking data to provide real-time bus information. This is now hosted by Metro under the name Tracker. An improved version of MyBus called OneBusAway, developed by UW graduate students Brian Ferris and Kari Watkins, combines Tracker information with Google Maps. OneBusAway continued to be maintained by the University of Washington Department of Computer Science, until a new nonprofit organization was founded to house and administer it in 2019.
* Transit Watch displays, like those found in airports and major train stations, are installed at some transit centers and transfer points to show real-time bus arrival information.
*A pilot project provided bus information displays along a city arterial. Metro discontinued the project in 2005, citing the cost of maintenance and technical problems.
* Metro has a regional trip planner that provides itineraries for transit trips within King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, including those on Sound Transit services, Washington State Ferries, the Seattle Center Monorail, and the Seattle Streetcar. Google Maps also provides trip planning using schedule data as part of their Google Transit service.

===ORCA Card===

Metro is a participating agency in the regional smart card program called ORCA (One Regional Card for All). It was launched for public use on April 20, 2009, along with six other transit agencies in the region.

===Bus stop technology===
RapidRide stations as well as major bus stops in Downtown Seattle are also receiving what Metro calls a &quot;Tech Pylon&quot;, a free standing wireless-capable kiosk, that has next bus arrival signs and an ORCA validator for off-board fare payment.

==Fleet==
As of 2017, King County Metro operates the 10th largest fleet of buses in the United States, with a total of 1,540 buses. The fleet includes a mix of electric trolleybuses, diesel-electric hybrids, and battery electric buses. Buses range in size from shuttles to articulated buses on higher-demand routes. The buses are painted in separate colors based on their vehicle type and intended services, with purple reserved for electric trolleybuses and red for RapidRide. The current livery and color scheme was adopted in 2004 and is intended to be replaced in 2025 with the introduction of a larger battery electric fleet.

In 1978, Metro was the first large transit agency to order high-capacity articulated buses (buses with a rotating joint). Today, King County Metro has one of the largest articulated fleets in North America (second only to MTA New York City Transit) and articulated buses account for about 42% of the agency&#x27;s fleet.

In 1979, the agency ordered some of the first wheelchair lift equipped coaches in the nation, promising a completely new level of independence for disabled residents. Early lifts were severely flawed, but by the mid-1980s the lifts were generally reliable and were ordered on all new buses. Metro&#x27;s entire fleet has been wheelchair-accessible since 1999 and all new buses have been low-floor since their introduction in 2003. The final high-floor buses were retired in 2020.

<text>The Munich University of Applied Sciences (HM) () is the largest university of applied sciences in Bavaria with about 17,800 students.

The Munich University of Applied Sciences was founded in 1971 by the amalgamation of seven colleges of technology and higher education, some of which date back to the early 19th century. Today it is the largest university of its kind in Bavaria and one of the largest in Germany.

HM collaborates with more than 200 partner universities in Europe, North and South America and Asia. International students make up 13% of the student body.

== Overview ==
In the winter semester 2022/23, 18,386 students were enrolled at Munich University of Applied Sciences (39.3% female, 60.7% male). There are 510 professorships, about 700 part-time lecturers, and 511 non-academic staff in its 14 faculties.

The university has 98 degree programmes in the fields of natural sciences/engineering, business, social sciences and design. It is spread over several locations. In addition to the main complex on Lothstraße/Dachauer Straße, there are also Pasing on the western outskirts of Munich and Karlstraße near the city centre.

Martin Leitner was elected President of Munich University of Applied Sciences in 2016 and re-elected for a second term of office from 2020. The Executive Board (university management) includes the three Vice Presidents Klaus Kreulich (responsible for teaching), Sonja Munz (responsible for research) and Thomas Stumpp (responsible for economics) as well as the Chancellor Jörg Finger (responsible for administrative management, legal matters, the budget and construction matters, among other things). Together with the Presidential Board, the central bodies (University Council, Senate, Extended University Management and Faculty Council) decide on university and state matters.

== History ==

=== Background ===

The oldest of the founding institutions of the Munich University of Applied Sciences was the &quot;Staatsbauschule München&quot;. Its predecessor institution, the &quot;Königliche Baugewerkschule&quot; in Munich, emerged from Hermann Mitterer&#x27;s building trade lessons at the Munich holiday school from 1821. After its formal spin-off in April 1823 under Gustav Vorherr, it was the first training centre for building tradesmen in the German-speaking world. In contrast to the École polytechnique in Paris and the Berlin Bauakademie, which already existed at this time, a modern building trade was taught here that was primarily orientated towards local requirements and also included the previously neglected rural areas.

In the wake of the November Revolution, the name changed in 1918 to Staatliche Bauschule München, later Staatsbauschule. This was not associated with a structural change. Even before the Nazis came to power, they massively attacked the management of the State Building School. In 1946, Max Stiehle, who had been persecuted by the Nazis, was appointed director of the State Building School.

The Higher Technical College of the City of Munich dates back to 1924. It came under the management of the National Socialist Gebhard Himmler in 1935. Disagreeable lecturers were sometimes formally dismissed or forced out, and there were also arrests. By the end of the war, many of the buildings of the predecessor institutes had been destroyed. Known as the ‘Engineering School of the Capital of the Movement’ during the National Socialist era, it was renamed the Oskar von Miller Polytechnic in 1946.

In 1956, the Bavarian state school inspectorate authorised a private technical school under the direction of Horst-Dietrich Bohne. From 1958, it was a higher technical college, where electronic computing was already included in the curriculum. It specialised in aircraft construction, automotive engineering and industrial engineering. The latter described the field of activity of industrial engineers. In 1967, the Higher Technical College was renamed the Bohne School of Engineering when it was taken over by a school association. The members of the Bohne Engineering School&#x27;s flight technology group had aeroplanes at their disposal for flight instruction in Fürstenfeldbruck and Bad Tölz.

HM&#x27;s predecessor institutions also included the Higher Technical School for Youth and Social Work (founded in 1919), the Department of Commercial Graphics at the Academy for the Graphic Arts (founded in 1907/1927), the Higher Technical School for Youth Leaders (founded in 1936) and the Higher Business School in Munich (founded in 1962).

=== Fachhochschule München ===
The Munich University of Applied Sciences was founded on 1 August 1971 as a result of the newly introduced University of Applied Sciences Act as the successor to these engineering schools and some higher technical colleges. As was customary at the time, the existing training facilities were utilised:

* the municipal Oskar-von-Miller Polytechnic
* the Munich State Construction School, Academy for Construction Technology
* the Munich Higher Business School
* the Bohne Engineering School
* the Higher Technical College for Youth and Social Work
* the Higher Technical College for Social Pedagogy
* the Department of Commercial Graphics at the Academy of Graphic Arts

were merged into one Fachhochschule.

In 2003, the photography programme of the State Academy of Photographic Design in Munich was incorporated into the Faculty of Design and in 2004 the academy was finally dissolved. Since 2007, the Munich University of Applied Sciences has been renamed several times:

In October 2007, it became the ‘Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften - FH München’, or ‘Munich University of Applied Sciences’ or ‘HM’ for short. In 2011, the addition ‘Fachhochschule’ was cancelled and ‘Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften München’ was adopted as the name, although the legal status as a university of applied sciences was retained.

==Organisation==
HM is organised into the following faculties:
*Architecture
*Civil Engineering
*Mechanical, Automotive and Aeronautical Engineering
*Electrical Engineering and Information Technology
*Building Services Engineering, Paper and Packaging Technology and Print and Media Technology
*Applied Sciences and Mechatronics
*Computer Science and Mathematics
*Geoinformatics
*Engineering and Management
*Business Administration
*Applied Social Sciences
*Design
*General and Interdisciplinary Studies
*Tourism
Faculty 13 is a special feature of Munich University of Applied Sciences: it offers general science electives, of which all students have to take a certain number during the course of their studies, and has only two degree programmes of its own (B.A. International Project Management and M.A. Intercultural Communication and Cooperation).

== University ranking ==
In a joint ranking by Wirtschaftswoche and Universum in 2020, Munich University of Applied Sciences was ranked first three times, second twice and third once in six subjects for which the universities of applied sciences were assessed, making it the best of all German universities of applied sciences.

In the international university ranking U-Multirank, Munich University of Applied Sciences achieved the top score six times in 2021. Since July 2011, Munich University of Applied Sciences has been one of the top 3 EXIST start-up universities in Germany and thus has access to millions in funding to support student start-ups. Start-up support is provided jointly with the affiliated institute ‘Strascheg Center for Entrepreneurship’.

Munich University of Applied Sciences and its Strascheg Centre for Entrepreneurship (SCE) regularly occupy top positions in the Gründungsradar study. The ranking shows at which universities start-up support is particularly well established. In the ‘large universities’ category (over 15,000 students), HM achieved first place in 2012, 2016 and 2022. In 2022, it had the highest score across all categories (large, medium-sized and smaller universities).

<text>iRobot Corporation is an American technology company that designs and builds consumer robots. It was founded in 1990 by three members of MIT&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Lab, who designed robots for space exploration and military defense. The company&#x27;s products include a range of autonomous home vacuum cleaners (Roomba), floor moppers (Braava), and other autonomous cleaning devices.

A planned takeover deal by Amazon.com for US$1.7billion, announced in August 2022, collapsed in January 2024 amid antitrust scrutiny by the European Commission.

==History==
iRobot was founded in 1990 by Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle, and Helen Greiner after working in MIT&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Lab. In 1998, the company received a DARPA research contract which led to the development of the PackBot.

In September 2002, iRobot unveiled its flagship home robot, the Roomba, which went on to sell a million units by 2004. iRobot began being traded on the NASDAQ in November 2005, under ticker symbol IRBT. On September 17, 2012, iRobot announced that it had acquired Evolution Robotics, manufacturer of automated floor mopper Mint.

In addition to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, PackBots have been used to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site, and an iRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In February 2016, iRobot announced that it would sell its military robotics business to Arlington Capital Partners, in order to focus more on the consumer market.

In November 2021, iRobot announced that it had acquired Aeris Cleantec AG, a Swiss air purifier manufacturer. iRobot began selling Aeris-designed air purifiers through its own brand in 2022. By 2020, iRobot had sold more than 30 million home robots, and deployed more than 5,000 defense &amp; security robots.

=== Attempted acquisition by Amazon (2022–2024) ===
On August 5, 2022, Amazon announced its intent to acquire iRobot in a deal worth US$1.7billion. The deal was subject to federal approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other regulatory agencies. In September 2022, the FTC requested more data from both companies, amid concerns about Amazon&#x27;s market power and the privacy implications of it gaining information about consumer floorplans. 

In June 2023, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority cleared the acquisition, saying it wouldn&#x27;t lead to competition concerns in the country. The European Commission launched a formal investigation into the proposed purchase in July 2023, citing that it would &quot;allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners (&#x27;RVCs&#x27;) and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider.&quot; In July 2023, Amazon reduced the offer price to $1.42billion after iRobot raised $200million in new debt to fund its daily operations. 

In January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced they would end their plans to merge in the face of opposition from EU antitrust regulators. This resulted in Amazon paying iRobot a $94million reverse breakup fee, iRobot laying off 31percent of its employees, and CEO Colin Angle departing. Gary Cohen was appointed as the company’s new chief executive in May 2024.

==Current home robots==

===Roomba===
Roomba is an automated vacuum cleaning robot first released in 2002. Roomba is powered by a rechargeable battery, and many models are available with a docking station to which the robot returns to recharge at the end of its cleaning cycle. They work in conjunction with accessories that use both IR and RF.

The company intentionally allows customers to hack the robot because they want people to experiment and improve the product. The API for the serial has been published and the serial port made easily accessible to make modifications easy to perform.

In 2015, iRobot released an updated Roomba called the Roomba 980, with a camera that uses VSLAM technology to map out a room and the objects in the room to clean the entire floor of a home. The Roomba 980 also includes carpet boost, increasing suction when the Roomba detects itself on carpets or rugs. This was also one of the first Roombas to include Wi-Fi connectivity with app control.

In May 2022, iRobot announced the new operating system and software platform for its Roomba vacuum cleaners, iRobot OS. The company stated the move from iRobot genius to iRobot OS will aid in giving their products a deeper understanding of the user’s households and the users habits, in addition to voice commands and greater objected identification.

In October 2022, iRobot released the Roomba Combo, which includes mopping capabilities. The robot is able to differentiate between hardwood floor and carpet, and it lifts its mop to the top of the robot when transitioning to carpet.

===Braava===

Braava is iRobot&#x27;s floor mopping robot, designed to work on hard-surface floors. Braava uses disposable or microfiber cleaning cloths for damp and/or dry cleaning. The 380t model comes with a Channel 4 NorthStar Navigation Cube, which is set on a high surface and directs the robot around the area it cleans.

The design was known as the Mint until 2013. It was developed by Evolution Robotics, which was acquired by iRobot in 2012.

===Create===
Create is a hobby robot, released in 2007. Create offers users the possibility of changing or adapting the robot&#x27;s functions through experimentation with the basic elements of robotics as well as by adding sensors, grippers, wireless connections, computers, or other hardware.

===Root===
Root is an educational robot designed for use by children learning how to code. It is programmed through a tablet or smartphone. iRobot acquired Root Robotics in 2019.

==In development==

===Terra===
In 2019, iRobot received FCC approval to move forward with their plans to commercialize a robotic lawn mower capable of using wireless localization technology, which they announced would be branded as &quot;Terra&quot;. Terra uses mapping to navigate and mow the lawn in a straight-line pattern. It uses smart beacon stakes to localize itself in the yard, and is taught a boundary by the user (where the robot should avoid going, such as a garden). Terra includes Wi-Fi capabilities and a docking station for recharging. Terra was available as a beta program in 2019 in Germany and the United States. The program was indefinitely postponed in March 2020.

==Discontinued products==

===Scooba===
Scooba was iRobot&#x27;s floor-washing robot. The product became commercially available in limited quantities in late 2005 before a full product release in 2006. Early models required either a special non-bleach cleaning solution or white vinegar to wash hard floors. Newer units could use plain water. Several versions were marketed. iRobot discontinued the Scooba line of products in favor of the Braava line of floor moppers in 2016. 

===Dirt Dog===
Dirt Dog was a variant of Roomba designed for workshop use that was released in 2006. The product picks up small objects such as nuts, bolts, dirt, and debris from a workshop or similar floor. The unit was able to be used on hard floors, shop carpets and industrial floor surfaces. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in late 2010.

===My Real Baby===
My Real Baby was a robotic toy marketed by iRobot from 2000 and produced in partnership with the toy manufacturer Hasbro. It is no longer in production. This product, which was meant to look like a human infant, employed animatronic facial expressions and was developed from an emotionally expressive and responsive robot developed by iRobot corporation called &quot;IT.&quot;

===ConnectR===
ConnectR was a videoconferencing robot which was prototyped in 2010. It did not pass pilot tests and was not sold commercially.

===Verro===

Verro was a swimming-pool cleaning robot released in April 2007.

=== Looj ===
Looj was a gutter-cleaning robot released in September 2007. Looj is not an autonomous robot, but rather a remote-controlled robot patterned after a toy tank with an auger mounted on the front. The robot fits inside most gutters to clean out debris stuck inside them, such as leaves and pine needles. It has long treads on its side which allow it to move inside the gutter. The auger dislodges and removes almost all of the debris inside the gutter by flinging it sideways into the air. Looj also has a detachable handle/remote that is used to carry and operate the robot. It was discontinued in 2017.

=== Mirra===
Mirra was a swimming-pool cleaning robot, the successor of Verro. Mirra cleaned a pool&#x27;s floor and walls of large and small debris. It was discontinued in 2014.

==Military and policing robots==
In April 2016, iRobot sold off its Defense &amp; Security unit, with a new company being formed called Endeavor Robotics. This unit became part of Teledyne FLIR in 2019.

===First Generation Robots===
* &quot;Genghis&quot; (1991) was iRobot&#x27;s first robot. It was designed as a test platform for researchers. The robot is currently at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
* &quot;Ariel&quot; (1996) is a crab-like robot designed to remove mines, both in and out of water.
* &quot;Urbie&quot; (1997) was a proof of concept robot designed for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, Georgia, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie&#x27;s list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which are attached to the chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front compartment holds 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front compartment holds a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras&#x27; images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0m turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.
* &quot;SWARM&quot; is an artificial intelligence research project designed to develop algorithms for swarms of hundreds of individual robots. This project is sponsored by DARPA.

===PackBot===

* &quot;PackBot&quot; is a series of military robots designed for situational awareness, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal and other missions. As of 2009, the US military had more than 2000 PackBots that were on station in Iraq and Afghanistan.

===SUGV===

* iRobot&#x27;s platform for the United States Army&#x27;s Future Combat Systems.

===Warrior===

* &quot;Warrior&quot;, currently in development (expected deployment in 2008), is a machine that can travel up to through rough terrain and up and down stairs while carrying payloads weighing over . Its potential uses include bomb disposal, battlefield casualty extraction and firefighting.

===R-Gator===

* &quot;R-Gator&quot;, a product of a partnership with John Deere Corporation, is a small utility vehicle with a robotics package added. It is capable of autonomous operation including waypoint following with obstacle avoidance, following dismounted infantry and other vehicles and semi-autonomous operation such as teleoperation with obstacle avoidance. Vehicles are currently in production.

===Negotiator===

* &quot;Negotiator&quot; is a man-portable civil-response surveillance and reconnaissance robot.

===Transphibian===

* &quot;Transphibian&quot; is a man-portable UUV and bottom crawler that autonomously inserts itself into the water and operates in a shallow area. It is designed for mine detection, harbor defense and surveillance.

===Chembot===
* &quot;Chembot&quot; is a DARPA-funded prototype of a shape-shifting robot without motors, wheels or any rigid elements. It runs on chemical power and is made using dielectric elastomers, which are extremely flexible and can alter their shape in electric or magnetic fields. Ultimately, the program aims to build a robot that is completely squishy and able to squeeze through a hole &#x27;the size of a 10 pence coin&#x27;.

===Ember===
* &quot;Ember&quot; is a prototype miniature, tracked robot, weighing around 1 lb and costing so little to make that it is intended to be virtually disposable. &quot;Ember&quot; moves at walking pace, can right itself when it is turned over and is controlled by a simple touchscreen application on an Apple iPhone. &quot;Ember&quot; is a military robot designed to boost radio communications and capture video footage to aid infantry warfighters.

===AIRarm===
AIRarm is an inflatable arm robot developed by iRobot. The inflatable arm uses pumps to inflate the arm. Since the arm uses strings and actuators, no motors were used at the joints.

===FirstLook===
FirstLook is a small reconnaissance robot weighing with a top speed of and line-of-sight control range of . It has visible and thermal cameras and infrared sensors to gather and transmit images of buildings, caves, or other locations. It can participate in explosive ordnance disposal by carrying of C4 explosive to an IED. The robot has the ability to mesh together a network of feeds from other robots to extend the range of its sensors. The FirstLook has CBRN detectors and is semi-autonomous, meaning it can perform tasks like course correction and flipping itself over without direct intervention. 100 were bought by JIEDDO in March 2012 and the Pentagon has ordered hundreds more.

==Medical robots==

===RP-VITA===
* RP-VITA, or Remote Presence Virtual + Independent Telemedicine Assistant, is a medical robot jointly produced with InTouch Health. The robot will be cloud-connected and have access to a patient&#x27;s medical record, and will also be able to plug in diagnostic devices such as stethoscopes, otoscopes, and ultrasound.

==Research and dual-role robots==

===Ranger===

* &quot;Ranger&quot; is a man-portable UUV that supports technology development related to mine warfare, expeditionary warfare, homeland defense, underwater surveillance / reconnaissance and other missions. Ranger is also suitable for ocean research and commercial applications related to search and survey.

===Seaglider===

* &quot;Seaglider&quot; is a long-range dual-role autonomous underwater vehicle, which was produced by iRobot from 2008–2013 under an exclusive manufacturing agreement from the University of Washington. Capable of operating for months over thousands of kilometers on a single battery charge, networked Seagliders provide scientists and naval intelligence with cost-effective real-time access to oceanographic measurements. The Seaglider is also used in military applications where it is more usually designated as an unmanned underwater vehicle.

== Criticism ==

=== Training data on Facebook ===
When training data for the Roomba J7 vacuum robot ended up on Facebook, like a test person sitting on a toilet, testers were assuming that they did not expect to give up their privacy and such data leakage, while iRobot took the standpoint that such persons are paid and expect their data to be shared. iRobot sent 2 million images to Scale AI, an image annotation service provider, and mentioned it terminated its business relation with Scale AI.

=== Unregulated use of reserved frequency ===
iRobot has been criticized for attempting unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn mowing robot without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol&#x27;s 6.66852 GHz emissions.

<doc id="1006356" wikidata="Q1076888" url="?curid=1006356" title="Creode">
<text>Creode or chreod is a neologistic portmanteau term coined by the English 20th century biologist C. H. Waddington to represent the developmental pathway followed by a cell as it grows to form part of a specialized organ. Combining the Greek roots for &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;path,&quot; the term was inspired by the property of regulation. When development is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.

==Developmental biology==

Waddington used the term along with canalisation and homeorhesis, which describes a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to homeostasis, which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill&#x27;s contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In the case of a pathway or creode which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory. Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures. Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is &quot;canalised&quot; to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.

Waddington refers to the network of creodes carved into the hillside as an &quot;epigenetic landscape,&quot; meaning that the formation of the body depends on not only its genetic makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo. He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape. Here we see that the &quot;landscape&quot; is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down. The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes. The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo. The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic feedback loops by which genes are regulated.

While Waddington does assert that the process of development is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary. He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than &quot;focal&quot; traits, such as the structure of the eye itself. Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one creode into another. Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.

This interpretation is further reinforced by Waddington&#x27;s discussion of the organization of the gene pool, where he points out that &quot;the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains.&quot; The more deeply creodes are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development. He also argues that deep creodes will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course. This phenomenon, which he calls &quot;stabilizing selection,&quot; puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.

Waddington&#x27;s emphasis on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in evolutionary developmental biology. As Sean B. Carroll and others have explained, genes involved in development are roughly the same in all animal species, from insect to primate. Instead of mutations in developmental genes, evolution has been driven by changes in gene expression, namely which genes are expressed at which times and locations in the developing organism.

==Architecture==

Architectural theorist Sanford Kwinter described the concept of the chreod as &quot;the most important concept of the 20th century.&quot; The word &quot;chreod&quot; also closely describes paths of decision within what Christopher Alexander has called configuration space, his term for what he notes that Stuart Kaufmann calls &quot;fitness landscape.&quot; By Alexander&#x27;s theory, because conscious human design decisions do not need to follow these chreods, conscious human design can lead to mixed results. Therefore, he proposes that discovering ways to allow architecture to follow these paths is the best way to get good results in the built environment. Alexander sees his theories of &quot;The Fundamental Process&quot;, &quot;structure preserving transformations&quot; and &quot;15 fundamental properties&quot; which he outlines in his work &quot;The Nature of Order&quot; as instrumentally shaping paths through configuration space.

<text>On December 26, 2000, a mass shooting took place at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield, Massachusetts, United States. Michael Morgan McDermott, an employee at Edgewater Technology, shot and killed seven of his coworkers. It is the deadliest workplace shooting in Massachusetts history.

== Shooting ==
The weapons he used were an AK-47 variant, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .32 caliber pistol. He fired off a total of 37 rounds, shooting his victims in the back of the head repeatedly. Police later found a .460-calibre Weatherby Mark V rifle in McDermott&#x27;s locker.

He was found by police sitting calmly and stated that he did not speak German. At trial, he stated that he was born without a soul and that God had allowed him to earn a soul by traveling back in time to kill Nazis. However, the prosecution asserted that the killings were motivated by his employer&#x27;s garnishment of his wages for the IRS in order to pay back taxes that he owed. Evidence also showed that he had researched how to fake mental illness.

=== Legal proceedings ===
McDermott was found guilty of seven counts of first degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

==Perpetrator==
Michael Morgan McDermott was born Michael McDermod Martinez in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1958, and grew up in nearby Marshfield. He was the second of four children to Richard and Rosemary ( Reardon) Martinez, who both worked as teachers. In 1976, he graduated from Marshfield High, where he was rather popular among his peers according to a former classmate.

Shortly after graduating high school, McDermott enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as an electrician&#x27;s mate, most of which was spent on the USS &quot;Narwhal&quot;. He was eventually honorably discharged with the rank of electrician&#x27;s mate petty officer second class.

From 1982 to 1988, McDermott worked for the Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. He then moved to Weymouth, Massachusetts, and began work in research and development for Duracell. In 1992, McDermott married Monica Sheehan. They divorced several years later. Around this time, McDermott began to gain significant weight. In 2000, after Duracell announced it would soon move to Bethel, Connecticut, McDermott resigned and later joined Edgewater Technology that same year.

In October 2000, McDermott moved out of his apartment in South Weymouth after failing to pay his rent, leaving the residence in a derelict state and owing the landlord $1,720. He then moved into an apartment in Haverhill. 

It later emerged that, in addition to his other financial troubles, McDermott had owed roughly $5,000 in back taxes to the IRS and that Edgewater Technology had withheld a portion of his wages in order to comply with an order by the IRS. 

As of 2024, McDermott is incarcerated at Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.

==Media references==
McDermott is cited in the 2003 psychology book &quot;Why We Hate&quot;.

In 2008, his case was studied on the psychology program &quot;Most Evil&quot;.

==Commemorations==
A cherry tree was planted outside of Edgewater Technology&#x27;s offices in Wakefield in memory of the seven victims. Every December, carnation flowers are woven into the branches in their memory.

<text>Mihály Vörösmarty (archaically English: Michael Vorosmarthy 1 December 180019 November 1855) was a Hungarian poet and dramatist who lived and worked in the Kingdom of Hungary.

==Biography==

He was born at Puszta-Nyék (now Kápolnásnyék), of a noble Roman Catholic family. His father was a steward of the Nádasdys. Mihály was educated at Székesfehérvár by the Cistercians and at Pest by the Piarists. The death of the elder Vörösmarty in 1817 left his widow and numerous family in poverty. As a tutor to the Perczel family, however, Vörösmarty contrived to pay his own way and go through his academic course at Pest.

The activities of the Diet of 1825 enkindled his patriotism and gave a new direction to his poetry. He had already begun a drama, &quot;Salomon&quot;. He flung himself into public life and fell in love with Etelka Perczel, who was from a higher social class. Many of his lyrics concern this unrequited love. Meanwhile, his patriotism found expression in the heroic epic &quot;Zalán futása&quot; (&quot;The Flight of Zalán&quot;, 1824), which, while dealing with the Hungarian past, also dealt with contemporary political concerns. This new epic marked a transition from the classical to the romantic school. Vörösmarty was hailed by Károly Kisfaludy and the Hungarian romanticists as one of their own. He had forsaken the law for literature, and his financial situation deteriorated. Between 1823-31, he composed four dramas and eight smaller epics, partly historical, partly fanciful. Of these epics he always regarded &quot;Cserhalom&quot; (1825) as the best, but later criticism preferred &quot;A két szomszédvár&quot; (&quot;Two Neighbouring Castles&quot;, 1831).

When the Hungarian Academy was established on 17 November 1830 he was elected a member of the philological section, and ultimately succeeded Károly Kisfaludy as director with an annual pension of 500 florins. He was one of the founders of the Kisfaludy Society, and in 1837 started two periodicals: the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; and the &quot;Figyelmező&quot;. The first was the chief bellettristic periodical, and the second was a critical periodical.

From 1830-43, he devoted himself mainly to drama, including &quot;Csongor és Tünde&quot; (&quot;Csongor and Tünde&quot;, 1830), a five-act play inspired by Albert Gergei&#x27;s &quot;Prince Árgirus&quot; and by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; and &quot;Vérnász&quot; (&quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, 1833), which won the Academy&#x27;s 200-gulden prize. &quot;Csongor és Tünde&quot; was described by György Lukács in 1911 as the best Hungarian play of the nineteenth century. He also published several volumes of poetry. His song &quot;Szózat&quot; (&quot;Appeal&quot;, 1836) was to become a second national anthem, and he wrote &quot;Az elhagyott anya&quot; (&quot;The Abandoned Mother&quot;, 1837) and &quot;Az uri hölgyhöz&quot; (&quot;To the Noble Lady&quot;, 1841). His marriage in 1843 to inspired him to compose a new cycle of love poems. They had five children, including Béla and Ilona. In 1848, in conjunction with Arany and Petőfi, he contributed to a translation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

With the support of Lajos Kossuth and Imre Cseszneky, he was elected to represent Jankovác at the diet of 1848, and in 1849 was made one of the judges of the high court. The national catastrophe (the fall of the revolution of 1848-49) profoundly affected him. For a short time he was an exile, and when he returned to Hungary in 1850 he was already in serious decline. In 1854, he wrote his last poem, &quot;A vén cigány&quot; (&quot;The Old Gypsy&quot;). He moved back to Pest to be close to doctors, and died there, in the same house where Károly Kisfaludy had died 25 years earlier. He was buried in Kerepesi Cemetery. His funeral, on 21 November, was a day of national mourning. His penniless children were provided for by a national subscription collected by Ferenc Deák, who acted as their guardian.

<text>Jan Akkerman (born 24 December 1946) is a Dutch guitarist. He first found international commercial success with the band Focus, which he co-founded with Thijs van Leer. After leaving Focus, he continued as a solo musician, adding jazz rock influences.

==Biography==

The son of a scrap iron trader, Akkerman was born in Amsterdam. He started playing the accordion before turning to the guitar. Around age ten he took guitar lessons and his first single, with the Friendship Sextet, was released in 1960, when he was thirteen years old. Akkerman won a scholarship to study at the Amsterdam Music Lyceum for five years, developing his composition and arranging skills.

At fourteen he was in the rock band Johnny and his Cellar Rockers with his friend Pierre van der Linden. Both then joined The Hunters. After seeing a performance by classical guitarist Julian Bream, he became interested in renaissance music and the lute. He started the band Brainbox with Van der Linden, Kaz Lux, and André Reijnen. They recorded for Parlophone.

Akkerman joined the Thijs van Leer Trio in late 1969 which, as the nascent band Focus, was the pit band for the Dutch theatrical production of &quot;Hair&quot; (recorded as an album in 1969). Under the name Focus, the band explored progressive rock, an amalgam of classical, jazz, and rock music, and had hits in the seventies such as &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; and &quot;Sylvia&quot;. The band&#x27;s albums &quot;Focus II&quot; (1971) and &quot;Focus 3&quot; (1972) were certified gold by the RIAA in 1973 for selling 500,000 copies each. The live album &quot;At the Rainbow&quot; (1973) and the band&#x27;s fourth outing, &quot;Hamburger Concerto&quot; (1974), were certified silver by the BPI for selling 60,000 copies each.

In late 1973 Akkerman was voted Best Guitar by readers of UK weekly &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, beating favorites such as John McLaughlin, Jimmy Page and Ritchie Blackmore. Akkerman and Focus were the only ones to challenge the bias toward American and British pop artists. He placed in third a year later in &quot;MM&quot;&#x27;s Polls, after Eric Clapton (#1) and Steve Howe (#2) from Yes. With manufacturer Framus he helped produce one of the first signature guitar models.

Atlantic released his solo album &quot;Tabernakel&quot;, which contains his playing the lute. His concept album &quot;Eli&quot;, recorded with Kaz Lux on vocals, won the Dutch Edison Award for best album in 1976. On the album, Akkerman experimented with a 12-string guitar tuned in parallel fifths. In the early 1980s he began to experiment with a guitar synthesizer, as on the album &quot;Oil in the Family&quot;. In 1985, he reunited Focus with Van Leer for an album and accompanying concert. The band reunited again in 1990 for the Dutch television program &quot;Goud van Oud&quot; (&quot;Old Gold&quot;). During the 1990s and in the 2000s he continued playing with his own band, and also as a solo musician, accompanied by pre-recorded computer-generated background (Roland synthesizers and Linn drums).

Akkerman was a session musician with André Hazes and worked with Alan Price, Herman Brood, Peter Banks, Jack Bruce, Charlie Byrd, Phil Collins, Paco de Lucía, Ice-T, and B.B. King.

In 1992, he was involved in a serious car accident, but he resumed playing in 1993. In the late 1990s, after an absence of nearly 20 years, he was persuaded to tour the UK again. He wrote for the Dutch magazine &quot;GitaarPlus&quot;. In 2013, Akkerman released the album &quot;North Sea Jazz&quot;.

<text>Sirens is a 1994 film, based on the life of artist and author Norman Lindsay, written and directed by John Duigan and set in Australia during the interwar period. &quot;Sirens&quot; was mostly filmed at the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum, Lindsay&#x27;s home and studio in Faulconbridge, New South Wales and the town of Sofala near Bathurst.

&quot;Sirens&quot;, &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Bitter Moon—&quot;all released in the US within weeks of one another—were the films that brought Hugh Grant to the attention of American audiences.

== Plot ==
Tony, an Anglican priest newly arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom, is asked to visit the notorious artist Norman Lindsay, out of the church&#x27;s concern about a blasphemous painting of the crucifix that the artist plans to exhibit.

Estella, the priest&#x27;s wife, accompanies him on the visit to the artist&#x27;s bucolic compound in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales. There, they meet Lindsay&#x27;s wife, Rose, two models, Pru and Sheela, and the maid, Giddy, all of whom pose for Lindsay. Devlin, the half-blind &quot;odd-job&quot; man, also poses for Lindsay.

Initially, Tony and Estella are both disturbed by the frank conversations about human sexuality in which the members of the bohemian group all participate. They are further startled by the amount of nudity they encounter, both in the studio and outside. As the story unfolds, both Tony and Estella find themselves observing the young women bathing naked in a nearby pool and instead of turning instantly away, each pauses to watch.

Joining the models to swim one morning, Estella is shocked when they bathe naked (she and the maid have come in swimming costumes). Estella is further shocked when Devlin arrives on the scene and the naked women flirt with him, knowing that he cannot see them. On a later occasion, Estella observes the two models caressing the maid, and joins them in stroking her. She doesn&#x27;t realise that her husband, walking nearby, observes this and is disturbed by the scene&#x27;s sexual content. At another time, Estella observes Devlin sunbathing naked, and flees when she realises he knows she is there.

Estella is increasingly affected by the sensuality of her surroundings and the bohemian attitude towards sexuality. Her relationship with her husband includes intimacy and commitment, but lacks passion.

The surroundings and the lives of the models are siren calls that lead Estella to fantasize with increasing intensity, and (with encouragement from the models) act on a few of her impulses. She suffers morning-after remorse about a late-night visit to Devlin. Influenced by supportive words from her husband, who had witnessed her earlier intimacy with the models, Estella shares a passionate moment with her husband.

While Tony is outraged to discover his wife&#x27;s naked likeness included in one of Lindsay&#x27;s paintings of a group of naked women, Estella merely observes that it is a good likeness, thus deflating her husband&#x27;s moral outrage and threats to sue. The next day, Tony and Estella leave the bucolic compound. They travel back home on a train in a shared suite and, showing a changed attitude, Estella caresses Tony with her stocking-covered foot. She falls asleep on the train, and dreams she is naked on a cliff with the other women.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The film was a long-standing project of John Duigan:

The starting point was the idea of doing something on the tension between the church&#x27;s teaching and the sensual side of life. I have always felt that the church&#x27;s actual teachings on this issue—since I experienced it first-hand as a boy at school—reflected some biases, particularly against the place and role of women in the church, and the place of women&#x27;s sensuality. I wanted to deal with these sorts of issues but I also wanted to explore them in a comic context. It&#x27;s a film about sensuality but if you don&#x27;t have a humorous aspect, then I think you&#x27;re missing out on a particular dimension of the sensuality.

He originally pitched the project to Kennedy Miller after making &quot;Fragments of War&quot; but they passed.

Duigan said that what drew him to cast Grant: &quot;Hugh has the capacity to be a terrific player of light comedy, in the tradition of Cary Grant and David Niven. He has the same ease and urbanity in the way he moves and talks.&quot; Grant told Farber what he brought to the character of the Anglican priest:

I kept looking at the part and wondered how I could crack it, because he was such a straitlaced character. And then I realized that if he thought he was trendy and &quot;avant-garde&quot;, that added a whole new swing to it. I see him as quite the star of his theological college, probably quite daring with his Turkish cigarettes. And I imagine that he even makes the occasional sexual reference in his conversation after a couple of glasses of sherry. But confronted with the real McCoy, in the form of Elle Macpherson without her clothes, he&#x27;s hopeless.

Most of the film is set at what is now the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum, which was the original home of the real-life Lindsay with sequences filmed at the railway station at Mount Victoria, New South Wales.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Sirens&quot; is best watched as a soft-core, high-minded daydream about the liberating sensuality of art...[it] has an archly intelligent performance from Mr. Grant, who turns the priest&#x27;s embarrassment into a real comic virtue. Ms. Fitzgerald, who made a strong first impression in &quot;Hear My Song&quot;, is again a forceful presence, even when acting out the story&#x27;s giddy erotic fantasies.&quot; Maslin said the film &quot;often verges on silliness and desperately overworks the symbolic importance of snakes. Still, it&#x27;s hard not to enjoy a film whose most intellectually daring character—Mr. Neill&#x27;s stern Lindsay—claims to have spent a previous life in Atlantis.&quot;

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was less forgiving: he called the ideas presented by the film &quot;warmed-over D. H. Lawrence&quot; and the film, a &quot;peculiar, not entirely undesirable sort of art-house hybrid, like a marriage between &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; and &quot;Baywatch&quot;&quot;, citing &quot;scenes, like the one in which Estella is brought to orgasm by the tender, knowing hands of a blind laborer, [that] are almost laughable.&quot;

Roger Ebert, guessing incorrectly that the inspiration for Neill&#x27;s character was Augustus John, noted that &quot;Sirens&quot; has &quot;no particular plot&quot;; he also called it a &quot;good-hearted, whimsical movie which makes no apologies for the beauty of the human body and yet never feels sexually obsessed.&quot;
