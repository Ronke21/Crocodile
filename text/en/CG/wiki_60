<doc id="993005" wikidata="Q2161657" url="?curid=993005" title="Roger Clinton Jr.">
<text>Roger M. Clinton Jr. (born July 25, 1956) is an American actor and musician. He is the younger half-brother of former United States President Bill Clinton.

==Early life and education==
Roger Clinton Jr. is the only child of car salesman Roger Clinton Sr. and nurse Virginia Dell Cassidy. As a child, his elder half-brother Bill Clinton often had to protect him from Roger Sr., who was abusive and an alcoholic. He became a musician and formed a rock band named &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Choice.&quot;

== Career ==

===Acting===
Clinton has had minor roles in several films, including &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; and &quot;Fred Claus,&quot; and guest-starred on a number of television shows, including &quot;The Nanny&quot; as himself (neighbor), &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, and &quot;Cybill&quot;. He also provided the voice of his half-brother, President Bill Clinton, in the pilot episode of &quot;The Blues Brothers: The Animated Series&quot;.

===Music===
Clinton developed his singing career under the direction of Arkansas music impresario and manager Butch Stone. He gained professional experience by singing warm-ups for the studio audiences at tapings of the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot;, as well as by working as a lounge singer. As a result of a deal struck by Stone and music-industry attorney Stann Findelle, Clinton was initially contracted to Atlantic Records in 1992. His first album, &quot;Nothing Good Comes Easy&quot;, was released in September 1993 on the Pyramid/Atlantic/Rhino label. In December 1999, Clinton and his band paid a visit to Pyongyang, performing alongside North and South Korean musical acts. He has played Farm Aid, and sang &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot; in Cleveland during &quot;The Cleveland Funeral&quot;, a program produced as a part of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

== Personal life ==
From a brief relationship with Martha Spivey, he has a daughter named Macy (b. 1992). Clinton married Molly D&#x27;Ann Martin on March 26, 1994. Their son, Tyler Cassidy Clinton, was born on May 12, 1994.

===Presidency of Bill Clinton===
During his brother&#x27;s presidential campaign and subsequent administration, Clinton was given the codename &quot;Headache&quot; by the Secret Service due to his controversial behavior. Clinton attracted negative media attention in 2001 when it was revealed that he had accepted $50,000 and a Rolex watch in 1999 from the children of Sicilian mobster Rosario Gambino, a convicted narcotics trafficker and Gambino crime family member serving a 49-year sentence, in exchange for lobbying his brother to pardon Gambino. Clinton repeatedly visited the federal parole commission headquarters to advocate for Gambino. In 1999, Gambino was included in a list of potential pardons, but he was ultimately not granted one. In January 2001, before his brother left office, Clinton was granted a controversial presidential pardon for a 1985 cocaine possession and drug-trafficking conviction. Roger Clinton Jr. had served time in federal prison after being convicted following a sting operation of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

===Driving-under-the-influence arrests===
Roger Clinton pleaded guilty in August 2001 to a misdemeanor count of reckless driving after Hermosa Beach, California, city prosecutors agreed to drop two driving-under-the-influence (DUI) charges and one count of disturbing the peace against him. He was sentenced then to two years&#x27; probation, ordered not to drive with any alcohol or drugs in his system and to pay about $1,350 in fines and costs.

On June 5, 2016, Roger Clinton was arrested for DUI in the seaside city of Redondo Beach, about south of downtown Los Angeles, California. Since it had been more than ten years since his first DUI, according to California state law, this arrest was also treated as a first-time DUI. Clinton pleaded no contest to the charge of driving while impaired. The charge of driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher was dismissed. As part of his plea agreement, he was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation for the DUI, and two days in jail for refusing a chemical test. He was ordered to pay a $390 fine (which increased to nearly $2,000 when penalty assessments, court fees, and other fines were added) and was also ordered to attend a nine-month alcohol program—the most a first-time offender can get—because his blood alcohol content measured 0.230% and 0.237% in a preliminary alcohol screening. In addition, because his arrest occurred in Los Angeles County, under the terms of Assembly Bill 91, the California Department of Motor Vehicles also required that he install an ignition interlock device in all vehicles he owned for a minimum of 5 months.

<text>Gapan , officially the City of Gapan (, Ilocano: &quot;Siudad ti Gapan&quot;, Kapampangan: &quot;Ciudad/Lakanbalen ning Gapan&quot;), is a component city in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 122,968 people.

Gapan is nicknamed the &quot;Footwear Capital of the North&quot; due to the thriving footwear making industry in the city.

==History==
Historical records called the town Ibon. Gapan was a town of Pampanga in the 16th century. 

During Spanish rule, in 1595, Gapan was reinstituted as a Catholic Christian town by the Spanish priests Contres Tendilla, Caballo, and Salazar. This makes Gapan the oldest town in Nueva Ecija and one of the oldest in the Philippines under Spanish rule. The town had a large jurisdiction embracing an area as far as Cabanatuan in the north, which was its &quot;barangay&quot; with the name Cabanatuan before it separated in 1750; the Sierra Madre in the east; San Miguel, Bulacan in the south; and Candaba, Pampanga in the west. Most of the original settlers in Gapan were Tagalogs from Bulacan and Morong (now Rizal Province) and Kapampangans; other early settlers came from Ilocos and Tayabas (now Quezon Province). Gapan, along with Aliaga, Cabiao, San Antonio, and San Isidro, were transferred to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848. 

After the 1898 Philippine independence, some of the town&#x27;s former districts became distinct towns until it remained to comprise only what are now the towns of Peñaranda, General Tinio, and San Leonardo (formerly called Manikling), all of which belong to Nueva Ecija province.

In 1982, the Gapan massacre occurred after the Marcos-controlled military killed a family, including children, in the town.

===Cityhood===

By virtue of Republic Act No. 9022 and its ratification in a plebiscite subsequently held on August 25, 2001, Gapan was converted into a component city of Nueva Ecija. Ernesto L. Natividad became the first city mayor of Gapan.

==Geography==
Gapan is located in the southern part of the province. It is bounded to the north by Peñaranda and San Leonardo, to the east by the Gen. Tinio, to the south by San Miguel in neighboring Bulacan province, and to the west by San Isidro.

Gapan is from Cabanatuan, from Palayan, and from Manila.

The city of Gapan held tremendous promise not only in its natural resources but also in its potentials in agri-base industries and in footwear industries which help sustain its virtual role in agricultural and industrial production. Commercial and trade activities in the city are further accelerated by the influx of financing lending institution and new businesses.

Like its sister city, Cabanatuan, Gapan also houses major shopping hubs in the province. The two major Philippine mall chains, Walter Mart and Robinsons Malls, has already established its presence in the city. Currently, major shopping centers in the city include: Walter Mart Gapan; Robinsons Gapan, Primark Town Center Gapan, Puregold, RCS Gapan, NOVO Gapan, Sansu Mall, Wilcon Depot, AllHome Gapan, A&amp;S Drugmart, STM Drugmart.

== Transportation ==
Gapan serves many bus companies operating provincial and regional routes. Jeepney operators serve routes within the province with some reaching as far to nearby towns in Nueva Ecija. Much of the city&#x27;s population rely on public transportation such as tricycles and jeeps to get around the city.

Two main highways serve the city of Gapan: Maharlika Highway and Jose Abad Santos Avenue. Maharlika Highway (or Pan-Philippine Highway) is the main highway traversing the city where most vehicles going to Cagayan Valley pass through. It links Gapan to its nearby city of Cabanatuan and town of San Miguel in the province of Bulacan. It also allows travelers to reach towns of Sta. Rosa and San Leonardo. On the other hand, Jose Abad Santos Avenue is the highway that links Gapan to the towns of San Isidro and Cabiao, where the road continues straightforward, again turning westward then eastward, entering Pampanga, and passes through Pampanga River.

One proposed expressway will pass through Gapan if built: it would be the North Luzon East Expressway (Quezon City to Cabanatuan).

<text>Komárom-Esztergom (, ; ; ) is an administrative Hungarian county in Central Transdanubia Region; its shares its northern border the Danube with Slovakia. It shares borders with the Hungarian counties of , , and and the Slovakian Nitra Region (Nové Zámky District, Komárno District). Its county seat is Tatabánya.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The predecessor of Komárom Esztergom County, Komárom county and Esztergom county were founded by Stephen I of Hungary. Both counties had parts that now belong to Slovakia. Throughout their history the borders of the two counties were frequently modified, and they were merged several times as well. When the castle of Esztergom was captured by the Ottomans in 1543, the leadership of the county fled from there. The castles of Érsekújvár, Komárom, and Tata were the three border castles stopping the Ottoman conquest for long decades. During the Ottoman occupation of Hungary, Esztergom became the center of a sanjak spanning across several counties. Komárom county on the other hand was continuously functioning, its castle was never captured by the conquering armies. The general assembly of nobles in Esztergom county was reintroduced after the liberation of the city from the Ottomans, by armies led by John III Sobieski in 1696. The assembly was dissolved in both counties during Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence, and then it was reformed after the war, in Esztergom county in 1710 and in Komárom county in 1712.

Esztergom county was one of the two counties in which the leadership consisted of common nobles and not religious and political leaders (the other one being Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun county). They were not granted the rank of lord-lieutenant unlike the leaders of other counties; they could only acquire vice-ispán and other lower ranks. The two counties were first merged in 1786 by Joseph II, with the new center being Tata. The merged county was separated after his death in 1790, and both Esztergom and Komárom were granted the rank of county center. The noble leadership was replaced by county commissions in both counties in May 1848. The county commission of Komárom county functioned until the end of the war of independence of 1848-1849, but the commission of Esztergom county was disrupted by the occupation of imperial troops on 15 January 1849. After the war the leadership of the counties was headed by Imperial–royal commissioners. In 1851 the parts of the counties that lay on the southern bank of the Danube were reorganized as Esztergom county with Esztergom as its center, and the parts on the northern bank were reorganized as Komárom county with Komárom as its center. These reformed counties only existed until 1860. After that the county commissions elected in 1848 restored them to their previous state. Towards the end of the 19th century, two towns in Komárom county — Lábatlan and Piszke — were added to Esztergom county, during the reorganization of counties in 1876.

===20th century===
In January 1919 the Czechoslovak Legion occupied the towns of Párkány and Komárom on the northern bank of the Danube. The workers&#x27; council and directory of Esztergom county were formed in its county center, while the directory of Komárom county was formed in New Komárom on the southern bank of the Danube.

After the Treaty of Trianon the northern parts of the two counties became parts of Czechoslovakia. After the treaty 44 villages from the former Komárom county and 22 towns from the former Esztergom county stayed in Hungary. In 1923 the two counties were merged under the name &quot;Administratively pre-merged county of Komárom and Esztergom&quot;. After the First Vienna Award in 1938, the two counties were restored to their former size. The size of Komárom county also increased significantly because the area of Csallóköz, which previously belonged to Pozsony county, was also added to it, so it consisted of six districts now, as opposed to the previous four. 

As a consequence of the temporary armistice following World War II the 1937 borders of the country were restored. Due to this a temporary administrative reorganization was conducted, where the previous Komárom and Esztergom counties were now merged for a last time under the name Komárom-Esztergom county.

<doc id="993015" wikidata="Q2955893" url="?curid=993015" title="RFL Championship">
<text>The Rugby Football League Championship, (known as the [[Betfred]] Championship for sponsorship reasons) is the second highest division of rugby league in Britain (with one team in the league also being based in France) after the Super League.

Introduced in 2003 as National League One, it replaced the existing Second Division. It was rebranded as the Championship in 2009.

The league consists of 14 teams, with the winner decided by a playoff and relegation to League One. The current champions are Wakefield Trinity, winners of the 2024 season after beating Toulouse Olympique in the Championship Grand Final.

==History==

===1902–1973: Establishment and regular competition===
Second division rugby league competitions have been played at various times since 1902, and have been in place annually since 1973. When Super League began in 1996, the second division continued to operate a system of promotion and relegation with the new competition. In 1999, the second-tier competition below the Super League was renamed the Northern Ford Premiership (NFP) when Northern Ford Dealers acquired the naming rights.

===2002–2008: National Leagues===
In 2003, the NFP was re-organised into National Leagues One and Two. Teams that finished in the top ten league positions of the 2002 Northern Ford Premiership joined National League One and the bottom eight joined National League Two. They were joined by London Skolars from the Rugby League Conference, who entered National League Two, and York City Knights, who replaced the defunct York Wasps (who had folded mid-season in 2002) and also joined National League Two in 2003, creating two ten-team leagues which operated a system of promotion and relegation between themselves while also maintaining the promotion and relegation between National League One and Super League.

At the same time, National League Three was created with teams from the Rugby League Conference and from the British Amateur Rugby League Association amateur leagues. It was intended that there would be promotion and relegation between National League Two and National League Three when League Three became more established, however this never eventuated.

===2009–2014: Championship===
In 2009 Super League was expanded to 14 teams, with two additional teams being promoted from National League One. In turn, two additional teams were promoted from National League Two to National League One at the end of the 2008 season, reducing the number of teams in National League Two to 10. National Leagues One and Two were then rebranded as the Championship and Championship 1 respectively, with the change being implemented in time for the 2009 season. Championship 1 was later rebranded to League 1. During this period, a system of licensing was put in place which meant there was no automatic system of promotion and relegation between the Championship and Super League, although promotion and relegation continued between the Championship and League 1. Widnes Vikings were promoted to Super League from the Championship via the licensing system in 2011.

The record crowd for a club game at this level of competition was set in 2017 at KCOM Craven Park for the opening fixture of the season between Hull Kingston Rovers and Bradford Bulls with Rovers winning 54–24 in front of a crowd of 8,817. The crowd record for regular season attendance was also broken in 2008 with an average of 2,205 spectators at each game.

===2015–2018: Super 8s===

In 2013, Super League clubs agreed to reduce the number of clubs in the competition to 12 and return to an amended system of promotion and relegation with a 12-club Championship competition. These changes came into effect for the 2015 season.

Under the amended structure, the 12 Super League and 12 Championship clubs play a regular season of 23 rounds, including a Magic Weekend for both divisions. Following the conclusion of their regular league seasons, the 24 clubs then compete in a play-off series where they split into 3 divisions of 8 based upon league position:
*The bottom 4 Super League clubs and the top 4 Championship clubs compete in The Qualifiers. They play each other once (either home or away) to determine which four of the clubs will compete in Super League the following year.
*The remaining (bottom 8) Championship clubs compete for the Championship Shield and to avoid relegation to League 1. Two clubs will be relegated each year.

===2019–2023: Return of playoffs===

On 14 September 2018, an EGM was called to discuss the future of the sport and a change in structure, as the clubs were in favour of scrapping the Super 8s in favour of a more conventional structure. Two proposals were put forward: one by Super League and one by the Championship and League 1;

Super League proposal: The Super League proposed staying with 12 teams who play each other home and away plus Magic Weekend and 6 loop fixtures (29 games). They also proposed a return to a top-5 playoff and the 12th placed team being relegated.

Championship &amp; League 1 proposal: The alternative proposal was that Super League would expand to 14 clubs playing 29 games ending with a top-5 playoff. The team finishing 14th would be relegated and 13th would play 2nd, 3rd and 4th in the Championship in a relegation playoff.

After a vote, the Super League proposal was voted through was implemented for the 2019 season. The Championship clubs then voted for a top 5 playoff being used to decide which team will be promoted to Super League.

==Clubs==
*&quot;Seat capacity for other sports, concerts and events may differ.

==Structure==
===Regular season===
There are 14 clubs in the Championship. During the course of the season (usually from February to September) each club plays the other twice, once at their home stadium and once at their opponents. Altogether clubs play 26 games.

Teams receive two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss.

Teams are ranked by competition points, points difference (points scored less points conceded), points scored. The team finishing top after 26 games is awarded the League Leaders Shield while the two bottom teams are relegated to the League One

===Play-offs===
The play-offs have had various formats. Currently once every club has played 26 games, the top six teams qualify for the playoffs.

Round one sees 3rd v 6th and 4th v 5th. The winners then progress to the semi finals where the teams finishing 1st and 2nd enter. The two winners of the semi-finals meet in the Grand Final.

==Results==


The champions of the Championship are determined by a playoff series at the end of the regular season. The team at the top of the league table at the end of regular season is awarded the League Leaders’ Shield. This has been the case for all but the four seasons of the Super 8s era where the league leaders were declared Champions and promotion was determined by The Qualifiers.

===Winners===
==Sponsor==
The Championship has been sponsored four times since its inception in 2003. Betfred are the current title sponsor.

The title sponsor has been able to determine the league&#x27;s sponsorship name. There have been seven different title sponsors since the league&#x27;s formation:
The official rugby ball supplier is Steeden.

==Media==
===TV===
Sky Sports and Premier Sports shared the TV rights to the Championship between 2008 and 2012. After Sky only showed the Championship and Championship 1 Grand Finals while games were broadcast on Premier Sports until 2013. There was no TV coverage on the Championship in 2014. In 2015 Sky Sports won the rights to show the Championship including The Summer Bash, Championship Shield and The Qualifiers in a seven-year deal.

A two-year broadcast deal with Premier Sports for 2022 and 2023 was signed at the end of 2021. Premier show a live match every Monday as well as all seven matches from the Summer Bash. The deal also includes the broadcasting rights to play-off matches and the Million Pound Game.

Premier Sports became part of Viaplay late in 2022 and was marketed as Viaplay Sports for the 2023 season.

===Radio===
Regional radio stations have coverage of the Championship clubs but mostly only cover Super League clubs in the same area and give updates of Championship scores and results.

==Academies==

===Reserve League===
In 2014 and 2015 Super League clubs were unhappy with the Dual registration system and wanted to form an Under 23 reserve leagues between the Under 19s and 1st team. Wigan, Warrington and St Helens were the first teams to propose the return of the reserve league where players could move from the under 19s and play with professional players before playing in the 1st team. A reserve league was set up in 2016 with a mixture of Super League, Championship and League 1 teams.

===Dual registration===
Clubs in both the Super League and the Championships benefit from the new dual registration system which was introduced for the 2013 season. The new system is intended to complement the existing player loan system.

Dual registration refers to an arrangement between clubs whereby a player continues to be registered to his current Super League club and is also registered to play for a club in the Championship. The system is aimed at young Super League players who are thought to be not quite ready to make the step up to ‘week in, week out’ Super League first team duties but for whom first team match experience is likely to be beneficial for their development.

*Only Super League players can be dual registered and the receiving club must be a club in the Championships, meaning that Super League to Super League club dual registrations are not available.
*A dual registered player will be eligible to play and train with both clubs in a format agreed between the clubs, subject to registration, salary cap and competition eligibility rules.
*The player is restricted to playing in one fixture per scheduled round of fixtures in any given week and would not be eligible to play for his Super League club on a Thursday and in a Championship fixture at the weekend, for example.
*A receiving club will be limited to a total of five dual registered players per matchday squad.

==Match officials==

All rugby league matches are governed by the laws set out by the RFL; these laws are enforced by match officials. Former Super League and International Referee Steve Ganson is the current Head of the Match Officials Department and Technical Director.

<doc id="993017" wikidata="Q185368" url="?curid=993017" title="Hajdú–Bihar County">
<text>Hajdú–Bihar (, ) is an administrative county (comitatus or vármegye) in eastern Hungary, on the border with Romania. It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg, Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén, Jász–Nagykun–Szolnok and Békés. The capital of Hajdú-Bihar county is Debrecen. Together with Bihor County in Romania it constitutes the Biharia Euroregion.

==Geography==
The area of the county does not form a geographical unit; it shares several features with the neighbouring areas: from northeast the sand hills of the Nyírség spread over the county borders. The western part is the Hortobágy National Park (&quot;Puszta&quot;), a large flat area of the country. The county of Hajdú–Bihar occupies the eastern part of Hungary. Most of its territory is completely flat and is part of the Pannonian Plain region (called the Grand Plain in the country). The highest point hardly rises over 170.5 metres in the north. It seems that the county slopes to the south because the lowest point is situated in this part of Hajdú-Bihar and hits the 85 metres height.

The wind and rivers formed and shaped the land for thousands of years. First the area of the present-day Hungary was occupied by an inland sea. Then, after some underground movement, the huge peaks of the Carpathians rose from this sea. The wild and rapid rivers of the mountains slowly made that inland sea disappear. Later, the great Hungarian plain was formed by the alluvial deposits of the rivers, the wind began to work and from the great rocks became smaller and smaller sand-grains, the so-called loess. This covers thickly the Hajdú-Bihar plain as well and makes a fertile soil. There are two great rivers in this area, the Tisza and the Körös. The Hortobágy area was formed by the first one. It used to be the flood area of the Tisza river and after the river was controlled, the Hortobágy became dry, resulting in special fauna.

==History==
Hajdú–Bihar county was created after World War II from the pre-1938 counties Hajdú and Bihar. See the articles of those counties for the history before World War II.

==Demographics==
In 2015, it had a population of 537,268 and the population density was 87/km2.

===Ethnicity===
The main minority populations in the county are Roma (about 18,000), Romanian (about 2,000), and German (about 1,000).

Ethnic groups (2011 census):
*Hungarians: 461,809 (95.05%)
*Romani: 18,132 (3.73%)
*Others and indefinable: 5,936 (1.22%)
About 77,000 people in Hajdú-Bihar County did not declare their ethnicity during the 2011 census.

===Religion===

Religious adherence in the county according to 2011 census:

*Reformed – 158,513;

<text>Bács-Kiskun (, ) is a county (&quot;vármegye&quot; in Hungarian) located in southern Hungary. It was created by the merger of the pre-World War II Bács-Bodrog and the southern parts of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun counties. With an area of 8,445 km2, Bács-Kiskun is the largest county in the country, slightly larger than Cyprus. The terrain is mostly flat with slight emergences around Baja.

The flag is vertically divided into two equal sections (blue and white), with the coat of arms on it. Its ratio is 2:1. The use of both coat of arms and flag is regulated by the county council.

==History==
Bács-Kiskun county was created from the pre-1938 counties Bács-Bodrog and Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun.
The county came into existence by the unification of some areas of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun (southern half) and Bács-Bodrog county after World War II.

The share of the secondary sector is relatively constant over the years, with 30.9% of the Gross Value Added in 2001 (compared to 29.5% in 1995). The tertiary sector&#x27;s GVA has increased most, although it still had a low share (56.8%) compared to the country as a whole (64.4%).

===Service and trade===
Service and trade are the dominant sectors of Bács-Kiskun&#x27;s economy, where privatisation occurred first.

80% of the industrial output is represented by the food, machine, wood, and printing industries. The more substantial companies in the region attracted more investment. In the course of privatisation the Kecskemét cannery was purchased by Heinz, the Kiskunhalas textile mill partially by Levi&#x27;s. During the privatisation, the Danube Knitting Mill in Baja was acquired by an American financial investment group

Among the industrial companies operating in the area of Baja are UNILEVER Rt. producing deep-frozen products, the Bread factory of Bácska Sütoipari Rt., the abattoir of DÉLHÚS and the Pannonia Brewery. The local government of Baja are encouraging the expansion of foreign capital by reducing local taxes.

There are approximately 39,600 firms in the county, representing 4.6% of the national total. The majority of companies employ only several people; indeed, 95% have 10 or fewer employees. Two percent of companies belong in the medium category, employing between 21 and 50 people, while the number and proportion of those employing 300 or more is very small.

===Agriculture===
Fruit, vegetable, corn and wheat production are the most successful branches of the region&#x27;s agriculture. Compared to the other Hungarian counties, Bács-Kiskun has the second largest number of pigs (10% of the Hungarian pig stock) and 7% of cattle stock. The stock of sheep made up 194,000 at the end of 2002, 17.6% of Hungary&#x27;s total stock and the largest in Hungary.

==Transport==

===Road===
On account of its central location, a great deal of the nation&#x27;s traffic necessarily crosses the county. The total length of main roads in the county was 2,213 kilometres in 2002 so for every 100 square kilometres of land area, there are 26 kilometres of main road. Despite the fact that a great deal of labour has gone into improving the quality of the roads in the last decade, there has been a deterioration in their condition on account of their intensive use. Fifty-six kilometres of motorways crossed the county in 2002, making the road link with Serbia and the Balkans.

Highway M5 and Road 5 go through Bács-Kiskun. There are many second-class roads throughout the county, giving easy access to every village. The international railroad lines Budapest-Subotica-Belgrade and the national railroad Budapest-Cegléd-Szeged pass through Bács-Kiskun as well.

===Rail===
The length of railways was of 641 kilometres in 2001 (32% electrified) and the most important lines in the county are between Budapest and Szeged and the route of the international express trains crossing Hungary in northwestern-southeastern direction leading to Belgrade. In addition to the main and secondary lines, there are a number of narrow gauge tracks for &#x27;nostalgia trains&#x27; which operate as tourist attractions.

Baja is the most important traffic junction of the southern part of the country. Its rail and public road junction is especially important due to the presence of the Danube bridge which provides a link between the Southern Great Plain and the Transdanubian region. The city has the best-equipped port in the country, where further development possibilities await the investors. At present a 120 places ro-ro port terminal is under construction.

 municipalities are &quot;large&quot; villages.

There are also public, religion and private schools in Bács- Kiskun county. 
Primaries are almost in all of the villages and towns. Some of them are quite big, but there are actually small schools with only a few students.
One of the oldest schools is the Calvinist Grammar School, which was founded in 1564. Religion schools are important in the county, as well as it is in this way all around in Hungary (in the county: Calvinist Grammar Schools- Kecskemét, Kiskunhalas, &quot;Piarista&quot; Catholic Grammar School, Kecskemét- for boys only-, &quot;Angolkisasszonyok&quot; Catholic Grammar School, Kecskemét- for girls only.). 100 years ago children could only learn in these schools, the first public grammar schools were founded only in the 1950s. Almost all of the religion schools were closed in the 1940s by the communist government, and were refounded only in the 1990s (like all of the Calvinist schools).
The main public grammar schools of the county are the Bibó István Grammar School (Kiskunhalas), Bányai Júlia Grammar School (Kecskemét), Katona József Grammar School (Kecskemét) and III. Béla Grammar School (Baja).
There are many competitions to the children in almost all of the subjects (mainly in Hungarian, English, German and Mathematics).
There&#x27;s only one University in Kecskemét, the Károli Gáspár Calvinist University of Law (it used to be the Calvinist Grammar School from 1991 to 1997).
The College of Kecskemét have several fields of study, like Teacher, Gardener, and so on.

<text>The Return () is a 2003 Russian coming-of-age drama film directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev and released internationally in 2004.

It tells the story of two Russian boys whose father suddenly returns home after a 12-year absence. He takes the boys on a holiday to a remote island on a lake that turns into a test of manhood of almost mythic proportions. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival (as well as the award for the best first film) and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. The film was also selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, but it didn&#x27;t make the final shortlist. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
In contemporary Russia, Ivan and his older brother Andrei have grown a deep attachment to each other to make up for their fatherless childhood. Both their mother and grandmother live with them. After running home after a fight with each other, the boys are shocked to discover their father has returned after a 12-year absence. With their mother&#x27;s uneasy blessing, Ivan and Andrei set out on what they believe will be a simple fishing vacation with him.

Andrei is delighted to be reunited with their father and Ivan is apprehensive towards the man whom they know only from a faded photograph.

At first, both brothers are pleased with the prospect of an exciting adventure, but they soon strain under the weight of their father&#x27;s awkward and increasingly brutal efforts to make up for the missing decade. Ivan and Andrei find themselves alternately tested, rescued, scolded, mentored, scrutinized, and ignored by the man. Andrei seems to look up to his father while Ivan remains stubbornly defensive.

As the truck stops and cafés give way to rain-swept, primeval wilderness coastline, Ivan&#x27;s doubts give way to open defiance. Andrei&#x27;s powerful need to bond with a father he&#x27;s never known begins, in turn, to distance him from Ivan. Ivan and his father&#x27;s test of will escalates into bitter hostility and sudden violence after the trio arrives at their mysterious island destination.

Ivan has an outburst of anger after witnessing his father strike Andrei. He shouts at his father, runs into the forest, and climbs to the top of the observatory tower. Andrei and their father run after him. The father tries to reason with Ivan, but this only stresses Ivan further. He then threatens to jump down from the top of the tower. The father tries to reach out to him, but falls to his death.

Ivan and Andrei take the body across the forest, bring him on board the boat, and row back to where they came. While the boys are putting their gear in the car, the boat starts to drift away. Andrei screams, &quot;Father!&quot; and starts running towards the shore, followed by Ivan, but it is too late. The boat and the body are sinking. Ivan screams &quot;Father!&quot; for the first and the last time from the bottom of his heart. They get into the car and drive away. The film ends with photographs from their journey; since the father does not appear on any of them, there is no proof that Andrei and Ivan went on a trip with him.

<doc id="993032" wikidata="Q3302" url="?curid=993032" title="Trave">
<text>The Trave () is a river in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is approximately long, running from its source near the village of Gießelrade in Ostholstein to Travemünde, where it flows into the Baltic Sea. It passes through Bad Segeberg, Bad Oldesloe, and Lübeck, where it is linked to the Elbe–Lübeck Canal. It is navigable for sea-going vessels from the Baltic to the Lübeck ports. The Herren Tunnel crosses the Trave, as do numerous bridges, and a ferry connects Travemünde with Priwall. Tributaries of the Trave include the Wakenitz and the Stepenitz.

==Course==
===Source and upper Trave===
The Trave rises in Gießelrade (a village in Ostholstein), whence it flows first southwesterly through the Wardersee to Bad Segeberg and then further south to Bad Oldesloe. There it bends eastward to just south of Reinfeld, flowing past Hamberge and (a district of Lübeck) to reach Lübeck.

===In Lübeck===

The Elbe–Lübeck Canal joins the Trave from the south shortly before the river reaches Lübeck. In medieval Lübeck the river was transformed according to the needs of shipping and the town&#x27;s defense, making the Old Town into an island. South of the Lübeck Cathedral the channel forks in several directions, with the original channel known as the Town Trave. The Lübeck town moat branches off to the west, and the Canal Trave separates eastward from the Town Trave&#x27;s course and runs in the former bed of the Wakenitz to the northeast side of the Old Town. The modern Wakenitz joins the Canal Trave from the east, and the three channels recombine at the north end of the Old Town island.

===Lower Trave===
North of Lübeck the seaports begin. Between the Old Town and is Lübeck&#x27;s commercial port. The Schwartau enters the river from the north here. On the peninsula between the Schwartau and the Trave is the Slavic castle of Liubice. The river passes the nature preserve and flows around . Here the city of Travemünde sits on the western shore. The Trave widens into the Traveförde estuary between Herreninsel and the mouth in the Bay of Lübeck, including the Pötenitzer Wiek and the Dassower See (fed by the Stepenitz). The river then flows out between Travemünde and the Priwall Peninsula into the Baltic Sea.

==Geopolitical significance==
In the early Middle Ages, the upper reaches of the Trave (together with the Schwentine) formed part of the Limes Saxoniae and the western boundary of Wagria. In the Old Town of Lübeck the river forms part of the medieval town fortifications. The lower reaches today form the border between Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

==Geology==
The course of the lower Trave arose in the last ice age (the Weichselian glaciation), when glacier flows carved deep fjords into what is now the Baltic Sea coast. Since the end of the ice age the groove communicates with the sea; its lower end is called the Traveförde (Trave Fjord).

==Recreation and conservation==
The area surrounding the course of the Trave is designated as a preserved &quot;flora and fauna habitat&quot; by the European Union Habitats Directive. The river runs through or beside a series of nature preserves and undeveloped lands, and its basin is home to a variety of rare and endangered animal species. The area is a popular destination for hiking, cycling, canoeing and fishing. The German Friends of Nature organization declared the Trave its German Riverscape of the Year for 2016/17.

<text>Nicola Griffith (; born 30 September 1960) is a British American novelist, essayist, and teacher. She has won the Washington State Book Award (twice), Nebula Award, James Tiptree, Jr. Award, World Fantasy Award, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize, and six Lambda Literary Awards. In 2024 she was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Griffith was born 30 September 1960 in Leeds, to Margaret and Eric Griffith. Griffith&#x27;s family is Catholic and she is one of five children. She knew she was gay by age 13.

Griffith is cousin to British actor Clare Higgins.

Griffith&#x27;s earliest surviving literary efforts include an illustrated booklet she was encouraged to create to prevent her from making trouble among her fellow nursery school students. At age eleven she won a BBC student poetry prize and read aloud her winning work for radio broadcast.

Her early reading included the works of such novelists as Henry Treece and Rosemary Sutcliff; fantastic fiction including the works of E. E. Smith, Frank Herbert, and J. R. R. Tolkien; nonfiction and history — Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; was a particular favorite.

Griffith took interest in the sciences as a teenager. She entered University of Leeds to study microbiology but did not complete a degree. Griffith was the lead singer and cofounder of the band Janes Plane, which experienced some success in England before breaking up.

By the late 1980s, Griffith had begun experiencing symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), though her illness remained undiagnosed. She was diagnosed with MS in March 1993.

While studying at Michigan State University, Griffith met and fell in love with fellow writer Kelley Eskridge. On 4 September 1993, Griffith and Eskridge announced their commitment ceremony in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, perhaps the first same-sex commitment announcement the paper had published. Griffith and Eskridge were legally married 4 September 2013.

Griffith wanted citizenship so she could remain in the country with her wife, but because she was a lesbian, she couldn&#x27;t receive citizenship through marriage, and all other pathways were closed. After much effort, Griffith received permission to live and work in the United States based on her &quot;importance as a writer of lesbian/science fiction,&quot; making her the first out lesbian to receive a National Interest Waiver. Her immigration resulted in a new law, and she is now a dual US/UK citizen.

== Career ==
In late 1987 Griffith made her first professional fiction sale: &quot;Mirrors and Burnstone&quot; to &quot;Interzone&quot;. Her debut novel, &quot;Ammonite,&quot; received several offers from publishers, including St. Martin&#x27;s Press, Avon Press, and Del Rey Books. Griffith has since published nine full-length novels, a memoir, and numerous short stories, essays, and novellas. While Griffith has said that she &quot;resists labels to describer her work,&quot; much of her published material contains themes of gender and sexuality.

In 2015, Griffith &quot;founded the Literary Prize Data working group whose purpose initially was to assemble data on literary prizes in order to get a picture of how gender bias operates within the trade publishing ecosystem.&quot;

In 2015 she began #CripLit, an online community for disabled writers.&quot;

In 2017, after completing her thesis, entitled &quot;Norming the Queer: Narrative Empathy via Focalized Heterotopia,&quot; Griffith received her PhD by publication from the University of East Anglia.

<doc id="993045" wikidata="Q2891401" url="?curid=993045" title="Football in Israel">
<text>Football (, &quot;Kaduregel&quot;, ), also known as soccer, is the most popular sport in Israel. Football as an organised sport, first developed in the United Kingdom, who controlled Mandatory Palestine during the days of the British Mandate.

The Israel Football Association joined the Asian Football Confederation in 1954, but was expelled in 1974 due to political pressure from Arab and Muslim members in the context of the Arab–Israeli conflict. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the Israel Football Association was not affiliated with any confederation. During this period, the Israeli national teams were only playing in FIFA competitions occasionally in OFC, UEFA and CONMEBOL qualifying tournaments. Finally, it was admitted to UEFA as an associate member in 1992 and as a full member in 1994, therefore their teams compete as part of Europe in all international competitions.

==Israel Football Association==
The Israel Football Association (IFA) is the governing body of football in the State of Israel. All of Israel&#x27;s professional football clubs must be members, and hundreds of semi-professional and amateur clubs also belong.

==League system==
As of the 19-20 season, the Israeli football league system has five levels and 16 different divisions, all run by the IFA. Promotion and relegation operate between each level, allowing clubs to progress from bottom to top within four seasons.

===Structure===
The current structure of the Israeli league system is this:
* Israeli Premier League: the top division operates at the national level and has 14 member clubs
* Liga Leumit: the second division operates at the national level and has 16 member clubs
* Liga Alef: the third division is split into two regional leagues (north and south) and has 32 member clubs (16 in each division)
* Liga Bet: the fourth division is split into four regional leagues (two in the north, two in the south) and has 64 member clubs (16 in each division)
* Liga Gimel: the fifth division is split into eight regional leagues and has 114 member clubs (between 11 and 16 in each division)

==Cups==
In Israel, there are two major cup competitions: the State Cup and the Toto Cup.

===State Cup===
The State Cup (, &quot;Gvia HaMedina&quot;) is the Israeli equivalent of the English FA Cup, and is open to all Israeli clubs, with clubs at the higher levels entering in the later rounds. It is a straightforward knock-out cup. The winner qualifies for the UEFA Europa Conference League.

=== Toto Cup ===
The Toto Cup (, &quot;Gvia HaToto&quot;) is the Israeli equivalent of the English League Cup, the main difference being that there is a separate cup for the top and second divisions. The cup is played first in a group stage, with the highest placed teams qualifying for the knock-out stages. The winner does not qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League.

== Title Holders ==

==Qualification for European competitions==
Clubs who do well in either the Premier League or State Cup qualify to compete in various UEFA-organised Europe-wide competitions in the following season (as well as continuing to play in domestic competitions). The number of Israeli clubs playing in Europe in any one season can range from four to six, depending on the qualification scenarios. Currently, Israel is awarded the following places in European competitions:

In addition, once in a European competition, it becomes possible to qualify for others:

* All the losers of the UEFA Champions League Preliminary Round and First qualifying round go forward to the UEFA Europa League Second qualifying round
* All the losers of the UEFA Champions League Second qualifying round go forward to the UEFA Europa League Third qualifying round
* All the losers of the UEFA Champions League Third qualifying round go forward to the UEFA Europa League Play-off round
* All the losers of the UEFA Champions League Play-off round go forward to the UEFA Europa League Group stage.
* Any clubs playing in the UEFA Champions League that will finish third in the group stage will go into the UEFA Europa League round of 32

==Israel national team==

Israel hosted and won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. Israel qualified for the World Cup in 1970 which was held in Mexico. Mordechai Spiegler scored in a 1–1 draw against Sweden. Israel&#x27;s Olympic football team qualified for the 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1976 Summer Olympics both times reaching the quarter-finals.

Israel&#x27;s highest FIFA ranking was 15th in November 2008.

Famous matches of the Israeli football team include the 1-2 and 0-1 defeat against Iran respectively in 1968 AFC Asian Cup and 1974 Asian Games, both held in Tehran when Israel and Iran were on friendly terms, the 3–2 win in France in the 1994 World Cup qualification, which ended up disqualifying the French team from the World Cup in the United States, the defeat of Austria 5–0 in 1999 during Euro 2000 qualifications, and a 2–1 win over Argentina in a friendly match in 1998, a game played in Teddy Stadium in Jerusalem.

==History==

===British Mandate===
During the British Mandate for Palestine, organised football consisted mainly of British and Jewish clubs, although Arab clubs also existed and took part in IFA competitions. As early as 1906, Maccabi Tel Aviv was formed as a social club, followed by a string of Maccabi clubs in other cities and towns, such as Jerusalem, Petah Tikva, Haifa, Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov and Hadera. On 24 April 1924, Hapoel Haifa was formed. Shortly after formation, they joined the World Maccabi Organization. The first membership cards read &quot;Club Hapoel Sport, Cultural Organization Haifa&quot; (A member of the World Maccabi Organization). Later, during a meeting of Hapoel labourers in Afula, it was decided to break off from the World Maccabi Organization and create the Hapoel (Labor) Organization, followed by Hapoel teams from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Herzliya and other cities and towns. Later, during the 1930s and the 1940s other sport organisations were formed, such as Beitar (founded by the right-wing revisionist party), Elitzur (formed by the religious Hapoel HaMizrachi party) and the short lived Hakoah 09 (formed by former members of Hakoah Vienna).

In February 1928, the first ever Tel Aviv derby took place. Maccabi won 3–0 and thus the oldest rivalry in Israel was born.

During the 1920s, and before the IFA was established, two cup competitions were held, one which acted as an unofficial national cup, which was dominated by British military teams, and one named Magen Shimshon, which was open to Maccabi clubs. In 1928 the People&#x27;s Cup began. This cup would later be known as Palestine Cup and, after the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the Israel State Cup. In the first final, played in Tel Aviv two Jewish clubs, Hapoel Tel Aviv met Maccabi Hasmonean Jerusalem and won by a score of 2–0, but the cup was shared since Maccabi appealed to the newly formed IFA that Hapoel had fielded an ineligible player.

Nine teams started the first league in 1932. The first winner of the league was the British Police, who, under the guidance of Police Chief Speiser, were the best-organised club in the country; Speiser would later serve as the first chairman of the football association. The league was held inconsistently, and only 10 titles were won between 1932 and 1947, all of which, beside the first title, were one by either Maccabi Tel Aviv (4 titles) or Hapoel Tel Aviv (5 titles).

During the British Mandate period, the IFA representative team competed under the title of Eretz Israel/Palestine, operating as a virtually all-Jewish combination. The first international match was a qualifying match for the 1934 World Cup against Egypt in Cairo, which resulted in a 7–1 defeat. The second leg played in Tel Aviv, resulted in a 4–1 defeat and an 11–2 aggregate loss. Earlier, in 1931, a mixed team of Palestinians, Jews, and British police played an international match in Egypt.

During this period Jewish teams took international tours in order to promote both football in Mandatory Palestine and the Zionist cause. Such tours include Maccabi Haifa tour of the United States in 1927, Maccabi Eretz Israel tour of Australia in 1939 and Hapoel Tel Aviv tour of the US in 1947. In return, many internationally famed clubs visited Mandatory Palestine and played Jewish and British clubs. Among these clubs are Hakoah Vienna, MTK Budapest and Hajduk Split.

===Post independence===
Just four months after Israel gained independence, the Israeli national team travelled to New York City to play their American counterparts in a friendly at the Polo Grounds. Over 40,000 spectators witnessed the newly formed Israeli side lose to the Americans 3–1. Shmuel Ben Dror went down in history as the first goal scorer in the history of the Israeli national team.

In 1967, Hapoel Tel Aviv became the first club to win the Asian Club Championships. In the 2001–02 UEFA Cup Hapoel reached the quarter-finals after knocking out Chelsea, Lokomotiv Moscow and Parma.

The 1970s and early 1980 were dominated by Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Maccabi Netanya. During the mid-1980s under the guidance of coach Shlomo Scharf Maccabi Haifa F.C. rose to power, winning its first two championship titles. In 1992, when Israel rejoined UEFA, Maccabi Haifa was bought by businessman Ya&#x27;akov Shahar who lead European standards of high quality management in the Israeli club. This move paved the way for private ownerships of football clubs in Israel.

Successful Israeli players who also played outside Israel include Eli Ohana, Mordechai Spiegler, Giora Spiegel, Ronny Rosenthal, Avi Cohen, Eyal Berkovich, Haim Revivo, Dudu Aouate, Yossi Benayoun, Tal Ben Haim, Elyaniv Barda and Biram Kayal.

The 2000s (decade) was dominated by Maccabi Haifa F.C. who won seven out of 11 possible championship titles, and also recorded good results in European tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup.

Israeli teams have also qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage six times: Maccabi Haifa in the 2002–03, 2009–10 and 2022-23 seasons; Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 2004–05 and 2015-16 seasons; and Hapoel Tel Aviv in the 2010–11 season.

After 2018, when Willi Ruttensteiner was appointed as technical director of the national team, a national football academy was founded, and three supporting development centers were established. As well the training of the coaches was strengthened.

<text>Krzysztof Artur Oliwa (pronounced ; born April 12, 1973) is a Polish former professional ice hockey player. A left winger, he played eight seasons in the National Hockey League. To date, he is the only player from Poland with his name inscribed on the Stanley Cup, as a member of the New Jersey Devils&#x27; 2000 championship team.

==Playing career==
Nicknamed &quot;the Polish Hammer&quot;, Oliwa was a big (6&#x27; 5&quot;), intimidating, physical player who played the role of an enforcer. After Mario Lemieux returned from retirement, Oliwa was picked up to protect Lemieux.

Born in Tychy, Poland, Oliwa played in the GKS Tychy youth system. He played one season in the Polish Junior League with Katowice, joining the Polish Under-18 team for the European Under-18 championship. Oliwa then graduated to the senior Tychy team in the Polish League for the 1991-92 season. Oliwa was named to the Polish national junior team for the 1992 IIHF U-20 Division 1 tournament. During his teenage years in Poland, Oliwa worked full-time in a coal mine, followed by a daily hockey practice. With a goal of making the NHL, Oliwa played the 1992-93 season in Canada for the Welland Flames junior team to adapt to the North American style of play.

Oliwa was drafted 65th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He joined the Devils organization immediately, playing for their minor league teams from 1993 until 1997. Oliwa made his NHL debut as a callup on March 9, 1997, and made the Devils full-time in the 1997-98 season. He played three full seasons for the Devils, culminating in the Devils&#x27; 1999-2000 championship season. Just before the playoffs, Oliwa suffered a serious knee injury. Against the team&#x27;s wishes, which wanted him to play in the playoffs, Oliwa had surgery and did not participate in the 2000 playoffs. However, Oliwa played enough regular season games to qualify to have his name inscribed on the Stanley Cup, making him the first player born and trained in Poland to have this honor.

Although still recovering from his knee surgery, in June 2000, Oliwa was traded to the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets. He only played ten games for the team before breaking his arm. He was then traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins to finish the season. Oliwa played a second season for the Penguins before being traded to the New York Rangers. His stay with the Rangers was brief. In his ninth game with the Rangers, Oliwa was suspended two games for his part in an on-ice brawl. After his suspension ended, he was a healthy scratch for six games, then placed on waivers. He cleared waivers and was demoted to the Rangers&#x27; AHL Hartford Wolf Pack team. In January 2003, Oliwa was traded to the Boston Bruins for a ninth-round draft pick, and appeared in 33 games for the Bruins. As a free agent, he joined the Calgary Flames for 2003-04 on a one-year contract. He signed with the Devils as a free agent after the 2003–04 season, however the NHL lockout intervened and Oliwa played a season in Poland during the lockout. After the lockout, in the 2005–06 season, Oliwa was waived by the Devils to make room for Patrik Elias under the new salary cap. After clearing waivers, the Devils chose not to demote Oliwa to their minor league team in Albany and instead sent him home. Under the rules at the time, half of Oliwa&#x27;s salary would have counted against the Devils&#x27; salary cap should he have been recalled and claimed by another team. Oliwa did not play again in the NHL. He retired at the end of the 2005–06 season.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Oliwa took up the position of head coach of the Polish National Hockey Program for a season. Later, Oliwa owned, managed and coached the USPHL Kalkaska Rhinos junior hockey team. He also was the coach and general manager of the Walnut Grove Wolverines of the Canadian Independent Junior League.

<doc id="993052" wikidata="Q2677518" url="?curid=993052" title="Coltrane changes">
<text>Coltrane changes (Coltrane Matrix or cycle, also known as chromatic third relations and multi-tonic changes) are a harmonic progression variation using substitute chords over common jazz chord progressions. These substitution patterns were first demonstrated by jazz musician John Coltrane on the albums &quot;Bags &amp; Trane&quot; (on the track &quot;Three Little Words&quot;) and &quot;Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago&quot; (on &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot;). Coltrane continued his explorations on the 1960 album &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and expanded on the substitution cycle in his compositions &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;, the latter of which is a reharmonized version of Eddie Vinson&#x27;s &quot;Tune Up&quot;. The Coltrane changes are a standard advanced harmonic substitution used in jazz improvisation.

==Function==
The changes serve as a pattern of chord substitutions for the ii–V–I progression (supertonic–dominant–tonic) and are noted for the tonally unusual root movement by major thirds (either up or down by a major third interval), creating an augmented triad. Root movement by thirds is unusual in jazz, as the norm is circle of fifths root movement, such as ii-V-I.

==Influences==

David Demsey, saxophonist and coordinator of jazz studies at William Paterson University, cites a number of influences leading to Coltrane&#x27;s development of these changes. After Coltrane&#x27;s death it was proposed that his &quot;preoccupation with...chromatic third-relations&quot; was inspired by religion or spirituality, with three equal key areas having numerological significance representing a &quot;magic triangle&quot;, or, &quot;the trinity, God, or unity.&quot; Demsey shows that though this meaning was of some importance, third relationships were much more &quot;earthly&quot;, or rather historical, in origin. Mention should be made of his interests in Indian ragas during the early 1960s, the Trimurti of Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva may well have been an inherent reference in his chromatic third relations, tritone substitutes, and so on. In playing that style, Coltrane found it &quot;easy to apply the harmonic ideas I had... I started experimenting because I was striving for more individual development.&quot; He developed his sheets of sound style while playing with Miles Davis and with pianist Thelonious Monk during this period. In terms of the origin of this “sheets of sound” technique, saxophonist Odean Pope considers pianist Hasaan Ibn Ali a major influence on Coltrane and his development of this signature style.

Coltrane studied harmony with Dennis Sandole and at the Granoff School of Music in Philadelphia. He explored contemporary techniques and theory. He also studied the &quot;Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns&quot; by Nicolas Slonimsky (1947).

A series of similar-sounding chord changes occurs in &quot;Ondine&quot;, the first movement of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s 1908 piano suite &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;. Other early appearances include the verse to the standard &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1917) by Jerome Kern. The bridge of the Richard Rodgers song and jazz standard &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot; (1937) predated Tadd Dameron&#x27;s &quot;Lady Bird&quot;, after which Coltrane named his &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;, by incorporating modulation by major third(s). (highlighted yellow below) &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot; may both have taken the inspiration for their augmented tonal cycles from &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot;.

The Coltrane substitution, Coltrane changes, or Countdown formula, is as follows. Start with a ii–V–I turnaround lasting four measures:
with the dominant chord (V7) preceding the tonic (I).

One substitutes two chords for each of the first three:

Notice a dominant seventh chord preceding and thus tonicizing a major chord on C and also E and A, both a major third from C.

This also may begin on C, as on &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, giving:


==Major thirds cycle==
The harmonic use of the chromatic third relation originated in the Romantic era and may occur on any structural level, for example in chord progressions or through key changes. The standard Western chromatic scale has twelve equidistant semitones. When arranged according to the circle of fifths, it looks like this:

Looking above at the marked chords from &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot;, B, G and D are spaced a major third apart. On the circle of fifths it appears as an equilateral triangle:

By rotating the triangle, all of the thirds cycles can be shown. Note that there are only &quot;four&quot; unique thirds cycles. This approach can be generalized; different interval cycles will appear as different polygons on the diagram.
==Musical examples==

===Tune Up===
These are the first eight bars of the Miles Davis composition &quot;Tune Up&quot;. The chord changes are relatively simple, a straightforward application of the ii–V–I progression, which is extremely common in jazz.

The chord progression is a standard ii7–V7–I progression in D major and then in C major. Assume that the time signature is and that each ii and V chord gets four beats and the I chord gets eight beats.
===Countdown===
The changes below show Coltrane&#x27;s substitution of chord changes over &quot;Tune Up&quot;. The ii–V–I progression from &quot;Tune Up&quot; still appears but is enhanced with several transition chords that lead to a more complex harmonic progression.


In the standard Coltrane change cycle the ii–V–I is substituted with a progression of chords that cycle back to the V–I at the end. In a piece, each chord gets two beats per change.

Coltrane developed this modified chord progression for &quot;Countdown&quot;, which is much more complex. At its core, &quot;Countdown&quot; is a variation of &quot;Tune Up&quot;, but the harmonic substitutions occur rapidly and trick the listener into thinking that they are listening to a completely unrelated tune. The ii, V and I remain, but in between are other chords (highlighted in yellow and blue) from the major thirds cycle centered around each I. Preceding the first chord of each major thirds cycle is its V chord.

An earlier Coltrane piece, &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;, also features two tonal centers a major third apart in its A section.
=== Giant Steps ===
The &quot;Giant Steps&quot; cycle is the culmination of Coltrane&#x27;s theories applied to a completely new chord progression. Coltrane uses the cycle in descending major third tonal transpositions in the opening bars and then ascending ii–V–I progressions separated by a major third in the second section of &quot;Giant Steps&quot;. The second section is basically the inverse of the bridge section described in &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones&quot; above.


Ascending/descending ii–V–I progression separated by a major third (tonal centers E, G, B, E, B)
This table shows which scales are used for the different chords:

==Standard substitution==
Although &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot; are perhaps the most famous examples, both use slight variants of the standard &quot;Coltrane changes&quot; (the first eight bars of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; use a shortened version that does not return to I, and in &quot;Countdown&quot; the progression begins on ii7 each time). The standard substitution can be found in several Coltrane compositions and arrangements recorded around this time, including &quot;26-2&quot; (a reharmonization of Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Confirmation&quot;), &quot;Satellite&quot; (based on the standard &quot;How High the Moon&quot;), &quot;Exotica&quot; (loosely based on the harmonic form of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot;), Coltrane&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, and the bridge of his arrangement of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;.

In &quot;Fifth House&quot; (based on &quot;Hot House&quot;, i.e. &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;) the standard substitution is implied over an ostinato bass pattern with no chordal instrument instructed to play the chord changes. When Coltrane&#x27;s improvisation superimposes this progression over the ostinato bass, it is easy to hear how he used this concept for his freer playing in later years.

<text>The Tupinambá ( Tupinambás) are one of the various Tupi ethnic groups that inhabit present-day Brazil, and who had been living there long before the conquest of the region by Portuguese colonial settlers. The name Tupinambá was also applied to other Tupi-speaking groups, such as the Tupiniquim, Potiguara, Tupinambá, Temiminó, Caeté, Tabajara, Tamoio, and Tupinaé, among others. Before and during their first contact with the Portuguese, the Tupinambás had been living along the entire Eastern Atlantic coast of Brazil.

In a sense, the name can be applied exclusively to the Tupinambás who once-inhabited the right shore of the São Francisco River (in the Recôncavo Baiano, Bahia), and from the Cabo de São Tomé (in Rio de Janeiro) to the town of São Sebastião (in São Paulo). Their language survives today in the form of Nheengatu.

In the 21st century, the Tupinambá people live in Pará, and the southern region of Bahia, around Olivença, Alagoas. The Tupinambás of Olivença&#x27;s fight for land recognition started in 2005, and reclaimed about 90 farms. The following year, they opened brand-new indigenous schools, with their own curriculum, language, and teaching methods, in 2006.

== History ==
Hundreds of years before the arrival of the Portuguese, the Tupinambá are said to have migrated from the South coast of Brazil to the Northern coast for the sake of better hunting and agricultural opportunities. From here they settled into communities that would sustain a population of about 100 people. The size and strength of the communities made them infamous in combat, but left them with very few alliances. The Tupinambá originally helped the Portuguese in enslaving other native populations, but the Portuguese eventually started to go after the Tupinambá as well. It was in part due to this lack of alliances that the Portuguese were able to conquer the group.

The Tupinambás were abundantly described in André Thevet&#x27;s 1572 (English: &quot;The New Found World, or Antarctike&quot;), in Jean de Léry&#x27;s (English: &quot;History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil&quot;) (1578), and Hans Staden&#x27;s (English: &quot;True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil&quot;, lit. &quot;... of a Landscape of the Wild Naked People&quot;), in which he describes the Tupinamba practicing cannibalism. Thevet and Léry were an inspiration for Montaigne&#x27;s famous essay &quot;Of Cannibals&quot;, and influenced the creation of the myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot; during the Enlightenment.

The Tupinambá may have given their name to the common French word for the Jerusalem Artichoke, the &quot;topinambour&quot;.

== Cultural practices ==
The Tupinambá were a group reliant upon agriculture for most of their resources, using the slash-and-burn technique in their practice. Both women and men were known to work in the fields, with the women often being the ones to till the soil before men would carry out their duties. However, the Tupinambá weren&#x27;t limited to farming. They were known to hunt, fish, and gather resources as well, though not to the extent of their agricultural labors.

== Demographics ==
There are two remaining regions inhabited by the Tupinambá. The Tupinambá of Olivença live in the Atlantic Forest region of southern Bahia. Its area is 10 kilometers north of the city of Ilhéus and extends from the sea coast of the village of Olivença to the Serra das Trempes and Serra do Padeiro. The other group lives in the low Tapajós in the Brazilian state of Pará.

== Tupinambá of Olivença ==

=== Land ===
The Brazilian government officially recognized the Tupinambá as indigenous people in 2002. In 2005, the National Indigenous People Foundation (FUNAI), which implements indigenous rights into the Federal government, created a technical group to define the 47,376 acres of territory occupied by the Tupinambá of Olivença as an indigenous land (&quot;Terra Indígena&quot;, in Portuguese). FUNAI approved the report in 2009, which arrived at the Federal Ministry of Justice in 2012. The Tupinambá of Olivença living in Serra do Padeiro reclaimed about 90 farms between 2004 and 2016 as indigenous lands.

A governmental proposal puts the Tupinambá of Olivença and other indigenous reclaimed lands at risk. In May 2023, the Brazilian House of Representatives approved the &quot;Marco Temporal&quot; project, which limits the demarcation of indigenous lands. It states that indigenous peoples only have claim to the land they occupied during the 1988 Constitution promulgation, meaning they can be removed from where they reside now if they cannot prove they permanently lived there in 1988. Farmers advocate for the project, since it defends private property. The project also threatens indigenous communities and their land. The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court declared the project to be unconstitutional on September 21, 2023. The declaration was overruled by the senate a week later. President Lula can still sanction or ban the project as of October 2023.

=== Education ===
With the land demarcation movement in progress, the Tupinambá were able to exert their constitutional right to differentiated indigenous education. As written in the 1988 Brazilian Constitution, indigenous peoples can use their mother tongue and own teaching methods in schools. The first indigenous-teaching school in Tupinambá indigenous land, the (EEITO), was created in 2002 and opened in 2006. The second school implemented was the (EEITSP), called (CEITSP) since 2015, which was first an annex to EEITO and opened in Serra do Padeiro. Both indigenous and non-indigenous people attend the school. It promotes social interactions between indigenous and non-indigenous, in an effort to maintain Tupinambá identity and fight intolerance.

<text>The [[Hanger Lane]] gyratory is a multi-lane rectangular gyratory – having the Hanger Lane underpass, under its southern limb, for the Western Avenue (A40). It enables intersection with the North Circular (A406) and the inceptive Ealing Road towards Wembley. It is in the north of the borough of Ealing in west London.

==Scope and interior==
It covers about . At rush hour it carries nearly 10,000 vehicles per hour. An above-ground section of the London Underground Central line passes under the structure which takes the form of a rounded-corner rectangular roundabout. The south-east corner of its interior hosts Hanger Lane tube station accessed by paths beneath; the rest hosts small utility buildings and a nature reserve which has many mature, deciduous trees – a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation.

==History==
In the 1960s, a long tunnel was built to take the A40 road underneath the Hanger Lane junction. The junction became a gyratory in the early 1980s when the western side of the loop was built. In December 2007 it was named Britain&#x27;s scariest junction.

Before its tunnelling cost was approved, the High Speed 2 railway was to cause a remodelling of the gyratory, but in April 2013 it was decided to put this section of HS2 in a bored tunnel instead due to the cost of rebuilding the gyratory system.

<text>Andrea Armstrong (born May 18, 1982) is an American who is a former NCAA basketball player.

Armstrong hails from Lakeside, Oregon, but was born in Longview, Washington.

After a stellar high school basketball career, Armstrong began her collegiate sports career in 2001, with the Kansas State University basketball team. She played for Kansas State until the 2002 season. She was a 2002 Academic All-Big 12 selection.

Armstrong transferred to the University of South Florida in 2003, which was a red shirt season in accordance with NCAA regulations. She was team co-captain for the 2004 season. She claimed to have converted to Islam soon after her arrival at the Florida campus.

Armstrong created a controversy when she requested to be allowed to play in Islamically appropriate attire. The school initially did not want to allow her to do this, and Armstrong lost her scholarship in the first week of September of that year.

On September 11, the school announced it was going to back off and let Armstrong wear modest athletic attire for their basketball games, and re-instate her scholarship. Armstrong and school officials had met the previous day to discuss her reinstatement. Ahmed Bedler, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was present at the reunion, and he declared that &quot;An athlete should not be asked to choose between engaging in healthy sporting activities and her deeply held religious beliefs&quot;.

Days later, Armstrong left the team. She averaged three points and two rebounds per game for South Florida.

In October, Armstrong also left Florida and returned to Oregon, where she e-mailed a local newspaper her reversion to Christianity and renunciation of Islam, and regretfully retracted her conversion to the latter.

<text>José Ignacio Álvarez Thomas (15 February 1787 – 20 July 1857) was a South American military commander and politician of the early 19th century.

== Biography ==
Álvarez Thomas was born in Arequipa, Peru, and his family lived for some time in Lima. When his father, who was in Spanish service, was called back to Madrid in 1797, they travelled via Buenos Aires. The family stayed there while his father continued the voyage alone, and Álvarez joined the army in 1799. Subsequently, he got heavily involved in the independence war in Argentina.

In the war against the British in 1806/07, he was wounded and captured, and released only after the withdrawal of the British troops. Under Carlos María de Alvear, he fought as a colonel at Montevideo, where he was awarded a medal. However, soon after he openly opposed the politics of de Alvear&#x27;s government, and his insurrection caused the resignation of the latter and resulted in a new election of a Supreme Director in the Constituting General Assembly, where he was designated interim Supreme Director from 20 April 1815, to 16 April 1816, in place of the elected José Rondeau, who was absent on a military campaign in Peru. Álvarez was sworn in on 6 May but had to resign a year later after some military failures. When the Constituting General Assembly was dissolved in 1820, he was, as a still-influential member of the former leadership, sent to prison, but released after 19 days. Subsequently, his political influence was greatly diminished.

In 1825, he was named ambassador in Peru, and in October also named ambassador to Chile. After his return to Buenos Aires, he was exiled and also spent some time in prison for his opposition against the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. He emigrated to Rio de Janeiro, from where he tried to mount an insurrection against Rosas in 1840. In 1846, he fled first the Chile and then Peru, before returning to Buenos Aires after the fall of Rosas government in 1852.

He died likely of tuberculosis on 20 July 1857, in Buenos Aires in Argentina at the age of 70.

<text>Derrick Ralph Adkins (born July 2, 1970) is a former American track and field athlete who specialized in the 400-meter hurdles. He was an Olympic gold medalist in that event at the 1996 Summer Olympics and World Champion at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics. He was the fastest man in the world in the 1994 and 1996 seasons, and holds a personal record of 47.54 seconds. Adkins was a two-time national champion at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

A Georgia Institute of Technology alumnus, he won back-to-back gold medals at the Summer Universiade from 1991 to 1993. He was also a gold medalist at the 1994 Goodwill Games and the 1996 IAAF Grand Prix Final. He represented the United States four times at the World Championships in Athletics, also reaching the final in 1991 and 1993.

Following his competitive retirement he remained connected with the sport and served as director of The Armory Track and Field Center between 2006 and 2011.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Adkins was raised in Lakeview, New York in Long Island where he attended Malverne High School, graduating in 1988. That year he was ranked as the number one high school 400-meter hurdler in the nation, having run the race in 50.71 seconds. He attended Georgia Tech where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering in June 1993. He also earned a certificate in biomedical engineering. Coached by Buddy Fowlkes and Grover Hinsdale at Georgia Tech, he became a six-time All American in the 400-meter hurdles and in the 4×400-meter relay.

His first international success was a gold medal double in the 400 m hurdles and 4 × 400-meter relay at the 1989 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships.

===Senior career===
Adkins reached his first senior global final at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics, placed sixth overall. He returned two years later at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, ending in seventh on that occasion. His first major title followed at the 1994 Goodwill Games in Saint Petersburg, where he ran a games record time of 47.86 seconds to claim the gold. Adkins was runner-up to Samuel Matete at the 1994 IAAF Grand Prix Final that year.

At the 1995 World Championships in Goteborg, Sweden, Adkins won the gold narrowly ahead of his career long rival Samuel Matete from Zambia in a time of 47.98 seconds. In the beginning of the 1996 season Matete beat Adkins four times in a row. Then just before the Games in Atlanta, Adkins defeated Matete in the Paris Grand Prix at the Stade de France in a time of 47.70.

At the Olympic Games in Atlanta, Adkins won the gold medal in a time of 47.54, beating Matete by 0.24 seconds.

In his career Adkins broke the 48-second barrier 20 times. He is one of the few hurdlers who have won back-to-back gold medals in the World Championships and Olympic Games. He was a two-time USA National Champion in 1994 and 1995. He was a two-time winner of the Weltklasse Zurich meet, having won the 1995 meet in a time of 47.65 seconds. He was a two-time winner of the Millrose Games in the 500 meters having run 1:01.71 at Madison Square Garden. He has set stadium records and meet records at the Penn Relays, the Lucerne Grand Prix (47.68), the Linz Grand Prix (47.70), and the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia (47.86).

He ceased to compete internationally after 2000 and made his last appearance at the national championships in 2004, pulling up in the heats of the 400 m hurdles.

===Post-competitive career===
In October 1996, local authorities of his hometown of Lakeview lobbied to change the name of the street where he was raised, from Seneca Road to Derrick Adkins Lane.

Adkins served as an assistant track &amp; field coach at Columbia University between 2004 and 2006. While coaching at Columbia, his athletes set seven school records and won six Ivy League individual-event championships.

Adkins served as director of The Armory Track and Field Center between 2006 and 2011. During his time at The Armory, the organization began hosting more than 100 track meets per year. He was influential in the decision to bring the Millrose Games from Madison Square Garden to The Armory where it continues to be staged annually.

At the Armory Track &amp; Field Center, Adkins also served as the Director of Armory College Prep, a college readiness program which served the student-athletes who attended the center. Students were provided college counseling services, academic tutoring, and SAT preparation instruction.

He was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Personal issues==
In 2009, Adkins was arrested for driving while intoxicated. He admits to having suffered a long-term battle with clinical depression and alcohol addiction.

In 2013, Adkins was arrested for obstruction of governmental administration in Long Beach, New York. The charges were dismissed. The initial charge was that he was running and walking in the wrong lanes on a boardwalk. In court, it was revealed that there were never any lanes on the boardwalk. The arresting officer never appeared in court. The Nassau County Public Corruption Bureau investigated the case and thereafter issued a written admonishment to the Long Beach Police Department.

On December 17, 2022, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an article wherein Adkins states that his depression emerged from head injuries which he had experienced as an athlete due to hurdle collisions.

<doc id="993083" wikidata="Q631342" url="?curid=993083" title="Historia Norwegiæ">
<text>Historia Norwegiæ is a short history of Norway written in Latin by an anonymous monk. The only extant manuscript is in the private possession of the Earl of Dalhousie, and is now kept in the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh. The manuscript contains several other texts; the &quot;Historia&quot; itself is in folios 1r-12r. Recent dating efforts place it somewhere c. 1500-1510.

The original text was written several centuries earlier than the manuscript itself; the text refers to both a volcanic eruption and an earthquake in 1211 as contemporary events, and Orkney is stated to be under Norwegian rule.

== Contents ==
&quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; consists of three parts:

# A short geographical survey of Norway and its dominions, followed by a brief history of Norway
# Genealogy of the Earls of Orkney
# Catalogue of the Kings of Norway

== Notable ==

One of &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;&#x27;s important features is a Latin translation of an independent version of Þjóðólfr of Hvinir&#x27;s skaldic poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;. Besides that text, there is the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. The text also contains ethnographic details, including a description of a shamanic séance among the Sami people. It is the earliest preserved written source for many of its historical details.

== Dates ==

Along with &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; and the work of Theodoricus monachus, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; is considered one of the Norwegian synoptic histories, and is thought to have been written, at the earliest, sometime between 1160 and 1175AD. This dating, however, is under debate and 1220AD may be more accurate. The text may have been composed somewhere in eastern Norway.

The manuscript was published by Peter Andreas Munch in 1850 as &quot;Symbolæ ad Historiam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum&quot;. The standard edition was that of Storm (1880) for many years, and the first English translation was done by Kunin and Phelpstead (2001). A new critical edition and translation appeared in 2003.

<doc id="993085" wikidata="Q3384923" url="?curid=993085" title="Coconut Palace">
<text>Coconut Palace, also known as Tahanang Pilipino (), is a government building located in the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex in Manila, Philippines. It was the official residence and the principal workplace of the vice president of the Philippines during the term of Jejomar Binay.

It was commissioned in 1978 by First Lady Imelda Marcos as a government guest house and offered to Pope John Paul II during his papal visit to the Philippines in 1981, but the Pope refused to stay there because it was too opulent given the level of poverty in the Philippines.

Coconut Palace cost ₱37 million to build and was partly financed by the coconut levy fund, which was set up to be used for the welfare of coconut farmers. Its construction is sometimes associated with Mrs. Marcos&#x27; edifice complex, a term popularized by an architectural historian as the &quot;obsession and compulsion to build edifices as a hallmark of greatness or as a signifier of national prosperity.&quot; It is owned by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).

Coconut Palace is made of several types of Philippine hardwood, coconut shells, and a specially engineered coconut lumber apparently known as &quot;Imelda Madera&quot;. Each of the suites on the second floor is named after a specific region of the Philippines and displays some of the handicrafts these regions produce. The palace is located on F. Ma. Guerrero Street at the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex between the Folk Arts Theatre and the Sofitel Philippine Plaza Hotel. Before becoming the official residence of the vice president, the palace was used for wedding receptions.

The palace is shaped like an octagon (the shape given to a coconut before being served), while the roof is shaped like a traditional Filipino &quot;salakot&quot; or hat. Some of its highlights are the 101 coconut-shell chandelier, and the dining table made of 40,000 tiny pieces of inlaid coconut shells. Highlighted as one of the Cultural Center of the Philippines&#x27; most striking structures for its architecture and interiors, the palace celebrates the coconut as the ultimate &quot;tree of life&quot;. From the coconut&#x27;s roots to its trunk, bark, fruit, flower and shell, the palace&#x27;s design, form and ornamentation echo these elements.

Coconut Palace has been a guesthouse for many prominent visitors, including the late Libyan strongman Muammar al-Gaddafi, Brooke Shields and George Hamilton.

Coconut Palace has been featured in various television programs. On the fifth season of the reality series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, the Coconut Palace served as the &quot;Pit Stop&quot; when the competing teams went to Manila. The contestants were welcomed by Luli Arroyo, daughter of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The palace was made a primary filming location for the ABS-CBN television series &quot;Princess Sarah&quot; as a boarding school, where Sara Crewe lives with Amelia, Miss Minchin and her student girls and &quot;Tanging Yaman&quot;, standing in for Malacañang Palace as the residence of the First Family.

Coconut Palace underwent major renovations as it was being eyed as the official office and residence of the vice president of the Philippines. On February 11, 2011, it was officially turned over to Vice President Jejomar Binay upon the signing of a lease contract with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) with a monthly rental fee of ₱400,000.

==Guest rooms==
The palace has seven guest rooms named after Philippine provinces:

* Zamboanga Room, the first room and said to be George Hamilton&#x27;s favorite
* Pampanga Room, showcases Kampampangan art with statues made of lahar from Mount Pinatubo
* Marawi Room, showcases Muslim Mindanao
* Bicol Room, Imelda Marcos&#x27; favorite room
* Mountain Province Room, containing many Cordillera tribal artifacts
* Iloilo Room
* Pangasinan Room, Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; room

<doc id="993088" wikidata="Q1233911" url="?curid=993088" title="Doctor of Business Administration">
<text>The Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) or (DrBA) is a terminal degree in business administration. The DBA is classified as a research doctorate or professional doctorate depending on the granting university and country where the degree was awarded. Academically, the DBA is awarded based on advanced study, examinations, project work, and advanced research in the field of business administration.

DBA candidates are required to submit a significant project, commonly referred to as a thesis, capstone project, or dissertation. This project consists of an extensive body of original academic research that possesses the potential for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Candidates must defend their work before a panel of expert examiners, known as a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee. In addition, most DBA programs have coursework requirements.

Along with the PhD or DPhil, the DBA represents the highest academic qualification in the field of business administration. Both the United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation recognize the DBA as equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree.

==Structure and Format==
Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. DBA candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behavior, economics, finance, and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the Bologna Process, the normal duration of research doctorate programs like the DBA and PhD is usually 3 to 4 years of full-time study.

The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, DBA programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian universities. For instance, a DBA student cannot embark on the research phase before passing the coursework phase. Students must clear ethics-related issues with an ethics committee upon passing the proposal stage. DBA candidates then go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Finally, candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee.

==History and Development==
The origins of the Doctor of Business Administration can be traced back to the early 20th century when business education began to gain recognition as a distinct discipline. The increasing demand for advanced business education, coupled with the growing importance of research in the field, led to the establishment of doctoral programs focused on business administration. One of the earliest instances of a doctorate in business can be found at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, now known as Harvard Business School, which introduced the Doctor of Commercial Science (DCS) degree in 1920, and then, in 1953, the DBA. Beginning with the 2018-2019 academic year, the Harvard Business School DBA transitioned into an Interfaculty PhD in Business Administration. The longest running DBA program is the DBA program of Business School Lausanne (BSL), a private business school located in Lausanne, Switzerland, that was launched in 1987. The longest running DBA program in the USA is the DBA program of Weatherhead School of Management, a private business school of Case Western Reserve University, that was launched in 1995.

During the mid-20th century, the DBA degree gained recognition as a professional doctorate that emphasized the practical application of knowledge in the business context. Many universities and business schools around the world began offering DBA programs to cater to the needs of senior executives and experienced professionals seeking to enhance their skills and contribute to the advancement of business knowledge.

In recent years, the DBA has experienced significant growth and evolution, especially due to an increase in online courses. Business schools worldwide have recognized the demand for doctoral programs that combine rigorous academic research with practical relevance to address complex business challenges. Contemporary DBA programs often integrate coursework, research, and professional development components. The coursework provides a strong theoretical foundation, while the research component requires students to undertake original research that contributes to the advancement of knowledge in a specific area of business administration. DBA programs typically attract professionals from a wide range of industries, including business, government, and nonprofit sectors. The diversity of backgrounds and experiences among DBA candidates enhances the learning environment and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration.

The DBA has gained recognition and accreditation from reputable academic and professional bodies such as the Executive DBA Council founded in 2011. Accreditation ensures that DBA programs meet specific standards of quality and rigor, and graduates of accredited programs are conferred with a reputable academic qualification. Accrediting bodies such as the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) provide accreditation to business schools and their programs, including the DBA. These accreditations assure prospective students and employers of the quality and relevance of the DBA degree.

== Recognition in Canada ==
In Canada, the DBA is recognized as a terminal degree in business administration or management. While DBA programs in Canada incorporate aspects of professional practice in addition to a full dissertation, they still qualify as full academic doctorates. Similar to the United Kingdom, the DBA in Canada can only be granted by Universities Canada, consisting of accredited institutions and holds equal standing with a PhD (management). The dissertation required for a DBA program differs primarily in focus but maintains the same breadth of study and academic rigor. DBA programs in Canadian institutions necessitate an original contribution to knowledge, overseen by an accomplished researcher as the chair, and defended orally (viva) before internal and external examiners.

==Relationship between DBA and PhD==
In the United States, the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in business administration are equivalent degrees. Also, both doctorates are viewed as research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business. As such, both DBA and PhD programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense. Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The DBA and PhD in business administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position in the United States; other countries&#x27; requirements may differ.

In some cases, the distinction is solely administrative. For example, Harvard Business School was not authorized to issue a PhD until 2018. In other cases, the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The PhD is highly focused on developing original academic knowledge, while the DBA emphasizes applied research. Upon completion, graduates of PhD programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of DBA programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of DBA and PhD programs often become adjunct professors in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

<doc id="993091" wikidata="Q5726050" url="?curid=993091" title="Henry Morris Naglee">
<text>Henry Morris Naglee (January 15, 1815 – March 5, 1886) was an American military officer and vintner. He served as a captain in the Mexican-American War, as commanding officer of the California Guards and as a brigadier general in the Union army during the American Civil War. He established a successful vineyard and distilled a brandy named Naglia which earned him a reputation as the &quot;Father of Californian brandy&quot;. After his death, his 140 acre estate and vineyards became the Naglee Park neighborhood of San Jose, California.

==Early life and education==
Naglee was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 15, 1815. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1835 as 23rd in a class of 56 cadets. Posted in the 5th U.S. Infantry he resigned shortly after his graduation and worked as a civil engineer for railroad construction in Virginia and Alabama.

==Mexican-American War==
Naglee came to California in 1846 during the Mexican–American War as captain of Company D of the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers. He commanded a detachment of volunteers to La Paz in Baja California and fought in the Skirmish of Todos Santos where he led 45 mounted soldiers into the Mexican rear, which led to the collapse of their resistance. In the following pursuit he ordered the killing of two captured Mexicans without orders, for which the military governor of Alta California, Colonel Richard B. Mason, ordered Naglee arrested. When President Polk granted a pardon to military and naval offenders acting in wartime, Naglee escaped punishment for this crime.

==California Guards==
After his discharge from the army, in 1849, Naglee became the first commanding officer of the 1st California Guards, a California Militia unit in San Francisco, the beginning of what would become the California National Guard.

==Business career==
He entered into banking and purchased 140 acres in Santa Clara, California in 1848. In 1858, Naglee studied viticulture in Europe. He built an estate and planted vineyards of Riesling and Charbono grapes, from which he distilled a clear brandy named Naglia. His high-quality brandy and his viticultural knowledge earned him a reputation as the &quot;Father of Californian brandy&quot;.

==American Civil War==
In May 1861 Naglee reentered the United States Army as lieutenant colonel of the 16th U.S. Infantry. As the regiment&#x27;s recruitment took longer and longer Naglee&#x27;s want for active service made him resign in January 1862. Naglee was made a brigadier general of Volunteers the next month and given command of a brigade in the IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac under command of general Silas Casey.

During the Battle of Seven Pines, he commanded the First Brigade in the Second Division under brigadier general John J. Peck. During the Peninsula Campaign he fought in the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31. His brigade and the whole division distinguished themselves when they were attacked, but had to fall back in the end. Naglee himself had his horse killed under him and received four wounds from musket-balls. While both praise and blame were given to the division, and Naglee, he wrote a number of reports and letters, increasing his role in the battle, that sparked great criticism and animosity. Later that year he commanded a brigade and a division in North Carolina, participating in the relief of Washington. In 1863 he commanded the VII Corps and the District of Virginia. In 1864 he was mustered out of the army and returned to San Jose to resume banking and brandy making. He also actively campaigned in the election of General McClellan for the Democratic Party.

==Personal life==
In 1865 he married 24 years old Marie Antoinette Ringgold, the daughter of his friend George Hays Ringgold and descendant to President James Monroe. From this marriage were born two daughters, Marie, in 1866, and Antoinette, in 1869. Mrs. Naglee died in 1869 and Naglee never remarried.

Naglee was involved in two public scandals. In 1865, Mary Schell, whom Naglee had met in 1858 and corresponded with while at war, published his love letters in a book entitled &quot;The Love Life of Brigadier General Henry M. Naglee, Consisting of a correspondence on Love, War and Politics&quot;, after he broke off their relationship. In 1877 his nanny Emily Hanks filed a lawsuit against Naglee, claiming he proposed marriage to her and then seduced her. This led to two trials and three years of headlines in the local newspapers. The court ruled in Hanks&#x27;s favor in the first trial, but in Naglee&#x27;s in the second.

==Death and legacy==
Henry Naglee died of &quot;neuralgia of the bowels&quot; at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco on March 5, 1886, and was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. His estate was developed into the residential Naglee Park neighborhood in 1902 by his daughters. A memorial was erected in St. James Park in San Jose to honor Naglee.

<doc id="993103" wikidata="Q7777424" url="?curid=993103" title="Theatre Royal, Dublin">
<text>Over the centuries, there have been five theatres in Dublin called the Theatre Royal.

In the history of the theatre in Great Britain and Ireland, the designation &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;, or &quot;Royal Theatre&quot;, once meant that a theatre had been granted a royal patent, without which &quot;serious drama&quot; theatrical performances were not permitted by law. Many such theatres had other names.

==The first Theatre Royal (1662–1787)==
The first Theatre Royal was opened by John Ogilby in 1662 in Smock Alley. Ogilby, who was the first Irish Master of the Revels, had previously run the New Theatre in Werburgh Street. This was the first custom-built theatre in the city. It opened in 1637 but was closed by the Puritans in 1641. The Restoration of the monarchy in Ireland in 1661 enabled Ogilby to resume his position as Master of the Revels and open his new venture.

This Theatre Royal was essentially under the control of the administration in Dublin Castle and staged mainly pro-Stuart works and Shakespearean classics.

In 1662 Katherine Philips went to Dublin to pursue her husband&#x27;s claim to certain Irish estates; there she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Pompée&quot;, produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London. Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of Pompey broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage.

In the 18th century, the theatre was managed for a time by the actor-manager Thomas Sheridan, the father of playwright and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Thomas Sheridan managed to attract major stars of the London stage, including David Garrick and the Dublin-born Peg Woffington. Charlotte Melmoth, later to become &#x27;The Grande Dame of Tragedy on the American Stage&#x27; began her acting career at Smock Alley. The theatre was demolished and rebuilt in 1735 and closed in 1787, falling into dereliction and used as a warehouse for almost 30 years.

In 1811, part of the 18th-century structure was demolished, and what survived was incorporated into the new Church of St. Michael and St. Johns, which remained as one of the most popular Catholic churches in the city centre until 1989. In 2012, after 6 years of building work, the 19th-century church building was converted for use as a theatre. The new theatre is home to the Gaiety School of Acting, The National Theatre School of Ireland.

==The second Theatre Royal (1788–1818)==
Crow Street Theatre was opened by Spranger Barry in 1758. The lovers Mary Bulkley and James William Dodd played here in 1774. In 1782 the actor Richard Daly became its owner, and in 1786, having obtained a patent from the Crown, he opened the theatre in 1788 as the Theatre Royal. £12,000 had been spent on rebuilding and decoration. It was profitable for a while, but later suffered from the opening of Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre

Frederick Edward Jones leased the theatre from Daly, and spent £1200 on renovating the house, which was decorated by Marinari and Zaffarini. It was opened in 1796 but closed when martial law was declared, relating to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Jones obtained a new royal patent in 1798, and spent a further £5000 on the theatre, but in the political climate, it had to close in 1803.

The theatre was wrecked in a riot in 1814, and there were further riots in 1819. Jones attributed his unpopularity to his being active in politics; in 1807 he had supported the election of an anti-ministerial member of parliament for Dublin. His application in 1818 for renewal of the patent was refused, being granted instead to Henry Harris, a proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre.

==The third Theatre Royal (1821–1880)==
In 1820, Henry Harris bought a site in Hawkins Street and built the 2,000-seater Albany New Theatre on it at a cost of £50,000, designed by architect Samuel Beazley. This theatre opened in January of the following year. In August, George IV attended a performance at the Albany and, as a consequence, a patent was granted. The name of the theatre was changed to the &quot;Theatre Royal&quot; to reflect its status as a patent theatre. The building work was not completed at the time of opening and early audience figures were so low that a number of side seating boxes were boarded up. On 14 December 1822, the &quot;Bottle Riot&quot; occurred during a performance of &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; attended by the Lord Lieutenant, Marquess Wellesley: Orangemen angered by Wellesley&#x27;s conciliation of Catholics jeered him during the national anthem, and a riot ensued after a bottle was thrown at him. Wellesley&#x27;s overreaction, including charging three rioters with attempted murder, undermined his own credibility.

In 1830, Harris retired from the theatre and a Mr Calcraft took on the lease. This theatre attracted a number of famous performers, including Paganini, Jenny Lind, Tyrone Power and Barry Sullivan. By 1851, the theatre was experiencing financial problems and closed briefly. It reopened in December under John Harris, who had been manager of the rival Queen&#x27;s Theatre. The first production under Harris was a play by Dion Boucicault. Boucicault and his wife were to make their first Dublin personal appearances in the Royal in 1861 in his &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot;. The first performance of Boucicault&#x27;s play &quot;Arrah-na-Pogue&quot; was held at the theatre in 1864, with Boucicault, Samuel Johnson, John Brougham and Samuel Anderson Emery in the cast.

This theatre was also noted for its musical performances, which included orchestral overtures and interludes to spoken drama and operatic stagings. The orchestra was conducted by Richard Michael Levey (1811–1899) between 1834 and the burning of the theatre on 9 February 1880.
In March 1874 John and Michael Gunn took ownership of the Theatre Royal from John Harris, who had run it for nearly 25 years.
John and Michael Gunn remained joint owners of the Gaiety Theatre, but John managed the Gaiety while Michael managed the Theatre Royal.

==The fourth Theatre Royal (1897–1934)==

The fourth Theatre Royal opened on 13 December 1897 by the actor-manager Frederick Mouillot with the assistance of a group of Dublin businessmen. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and built on the site of the Leinster Hall theatre, which in turn had been built on the site of the third Theatre Royal. It had seating for an audience of 2,011 people.

This new theatre found itself in competition with the Gaiety Theatre, which prompted Mouillot to try to attract as many big-name stars and companies as possible. At first, the theatre was noted for its opera and musical comedy productions. On 28 April 1904, Edward VII attended a state performance at the theatre.

Mouillot died in 1911 and one of his partners, David Tellford took over the running of the theatre. As musical comedy went out of fashion in the early years of the 20th century, the Royal started to stage music hall shows on a regular basis. In one such show in 1906, a young Charlie Chaplin performed as part of an act called The Eight Lancashire Lads. In its final years, the Theatre was also used as a cinema. It closed on 3 March 1934 and was demolished soon after.
==The fifth Theatre Royal (1935–1962)==

The fifth Theatre Royal opened on 23 September 1935 in Hawkins Street. It was a large art deco building designed for an audience of 3,700 people seated and 300 standing, and was intended for use as both theatre and cinema. It also housed the Regal Rooms Restaurant (converted into the Regal Rooms Cinema in 1938). The theatre had a resident 25-piece orchestra under the direction of Jimmy Campbell and a troupe of singer-dancers, the Royalettes. From the beginning, the sheer size of the building made it difficult for the Royal to remain economically viable. The policy adopted at first to confront this problem was to book big-name stars from overseas to fill the building. These included Gracie Fields, George Formby, Max Wall, Max Miller and Jimmy Durante. However, these shows rarely made a profit.

In 1936, the Royal was acquired by Patrick Wall and Louis Elliman, who also owned the Gaiety. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Wall and Elliman were forced to keep the two theatres going with native talent only. This led to the emergence of a raft of Irish acts which were to provide the mainstay of the Royal&#x27;s output for the remainder of its existence. These included such Irish household names as Jimmy O&#x27;Dea, Harry O&#x27;Donovan, Maureen Potter, Danny Cummins, Mike Nolan, Alice Dalgarno, Noel Purcell, Micheál Mac Liammóir, Cecil Sheridan, Jack Cruise, Paddy Crosbie and Patricia Cahill. In July 1951 Judy Garland appeared for a series of sold-out performances and was received with tremendous ovations. The legendary singer sang from her dressing room window to hundreds of people who were unable to get tickets and critics dubbed her &quot;America&#x27;s Colleen&quot;. She drew the largest crowds up until that time and was only surpassed by the visits to Ireland of United States President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Pope John Paul II in 1979. Popular Irish American entertainer Carmel Quinn also made her singing debut here during the early 1950s.

Under pressure from rising overhead costs and the increasing popularity of the cinema and the introduction of television, the fifth Theatre Royal closed its doors on 30 June 1962. However, some critics of the developers who purchased the theatre have expressed doubt that this was the reason for closing the venue. Cecil Sheridan commented that &quot;It&#x27;s not television that&#x27;s done it, you know. It&#x27;s a matter of how much money you can make out of a square foot of property.&quot; On the final night on 30 June 1962, the theatre was sold out with a show entitled the &quot;Royal Finale&quot;. Everything that could be taken away was sold off from the building, from the safety curtain to the ticket kiosks. The building was subsequently demolished and replaced by a twelve-storey office block, Hawkins House, which was the headquarters of Ireland&#x27;s Department of Health until 2019.

In 1972, The New Metropole, opened on the corner of Hawkins Street and Townsend Street on the site of The Regal Rooms. It operated as the Screen Cinema from 1984 until 2016. The building was demolished in 2019.

==Legacy==
In 2022, during redevelopment in the area, a campaign began to rename a street in the vicinity of the demolished theatre as Theatre Royal Way.

<text>Olten (High Alemannic: &quot;Oute&quot;) is a town in the canton of Solothurn in Switzerland and capital of the district of the same name.

Olten grew into a town during the Middle Ages at the location of a bridge over the Aare. After a period of decline, it grew rapidly as a railway town in the 19th century. Its railway station is a major rail hub of Switzerland, located at the junction of lines to Zürich, Basel, Bern, and Lucerne, all of which are within 30 minutes by train, and the town is also home to a depot for Swiss Federal Railways.

==History==

Significant amounts of artefacts of the Magdalenian (c. 16&#x27;000 to 14&#x27;000 years ago) have been excavated near Olten.
There are also finds dated to the Mesolithic and Neolithic, but there is no trace of a settlement, and no ceramic finds; finds dating to the Bronze and Iron Ages are also rather limited.
There was a vicus at the site during the Roman era. The name of the settlement is not known, but it seems to have been of a certain importance, presumably reflecting the presence of a bridge across the Aare. The Roman settlement was probably destroyed in the later 3rd century.
At the end of the 3rd century, a fortification was built at the bridge-head, on the south-eastern corner of the earlier vicus. This fortress was abandoned in the 4th century, and later replaced by a larger castle, comparable to late Roman fortresses protecting crossings of the Aare at Solothurn and Brugg.

The medieval settlement was built on the foundations of the Roman castle. It is first mentioned in 1201, as &quot;Oltun&quot; (conjectured as continuing an &quot;*Olodunum&quot;, with the Gaulish suffix &quot;dunum&quot; &quot;fort&quot;, and a prefix &quot;olo-&quot;, possibly from a hydronym, thus &quot;river-fort&quot;).
It was in possession of the counts of Frohburg in the 13th century, passing to Kyburg in 1377 and to Habsburg in 1384.
Olten passed under the administration of Basel in 1407, which invested in infrastructure, which was however destroyed in fires in 1411 and 1422. Basel lost interest in rebuilding the town again after the 1422 fire, and sold the settlement to Solothurn in 1426.

Throughout the medieval period, Olten was little more than a fortified bridge-head with some services (blacksmiths, taverns); its total population is estimated to about 500 people for the year 1600. Olten lost its city rights in 1653 as punishment for its support of the rebels in the Swiss Peasant War.
This resulted in a lasting tradition of resistance against authority in Olten, and the town welcomed as liberators the French troops in the 1798 invasion. In 1814, Solothurn suppressed another rebellion of Olten patriots against the Swiss Restauration.

Olten first reached a population of 1,000 in the later 18th century. More rapid growth set in after the introduction of the railway in 1856, and the town became an industrial and infrastructural center, reaching 7,000 by 1900. By the 1880s, Olten had developed into a second urban center in the canton, and attracted more infrastructure such as the cantonal hospital (1880), a business school (1912), a cantonal gymnasium (1938). Population tripled again during the 20th century, reaching 21,000 in 1970, but has slightly decreased since.

==Geography==

Olten has an area, , of . Of this area, or 12.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 41.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 40.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 4.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.5% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 6.0% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 15.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 11.6%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 4.2% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 3.1%. Out of the forested land, 40.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.1% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 6.2% is used for growing crops and 5.9% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.

The old city of the capital of the Olten district is located in a bend of the river between the Aare and Dünnern rivers. In the 19th Century housing estates were built in the valley on both sides of the Aare between slopes of the Jura Mountains to the north and the Born, Säli und Engelberg mountains to the south.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Argent three Fir Trees Vert trunked Gules issuant from a Mount of 3 Coupeaux of the second.&quot;

<text>William Henry Davies (3 July 1871 – 26 September 1940) was a Welsh poet and writer, who spent much of his life as a tramp or hobo in the United Kingdom and the United States, yet became one of the most popular poets of his time. His themes included observations on life&#x27;s hardships, the ways the human condition is reflected in nature, his tramping adventures and the characters he met. His work has been classed as Georgian, though it is not typical of that class of work in theme or style.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
The son of an iron moulder, Davies was born at 6 Portland Street in the Pillgwenlly district of Newport, Monmouthshire, a busy port. He had an older brother, Francis Gomer Boase, born with part of his skull displaced, who Davies&#x27; biographer describes as &quot;simple and peculiar&quot;. In 1874 a sister, Matilda, was born.

In November 1874, William was aged three when his father died. The next year his mother, Mary Anne Davies, remarried as Mrs Joseph Hill. She agreed that care of the three children should pass to their paternal grandparents, Francis and Lydia Davies, who ran the nearby &quot;Church House Inn&quot; at 14 Portland Street. His grandfather Francis Boase Davies, originally from Cornwall, had been a sea captain. Davies was related to the British actor Sir Henry Irving, known as Cousin Brodribb to the family. He later recalled his grandmother speaking of Irving as &quot;the cousin who brought disgrace on us.&quot; According to a neighbour&#x27;s memories, she wore &quot;pretty little caps, with bebe ribbon, tiny roses and puce trimmings.&quot; Osbert Sitwell, introducing the 1943 &quot;Collected Poems of W. H. Davies,&quot; recalled Davies telling him that along with his grandparents and himself, his home held &quot;an imbecile brother, a sister... a maidservant, a dog, a cat, a parrot, a dove and a canary bird.&quot; Sitwell also recounts how Davies&#x27;s grandmother, a Baptist, was &quot;of a more austere and religious turn of mind than her husband.&quot;

In 1879 the family moved to Raglan Street, Newport, then to Upper Lewis Street, where William attended Temple School. In 1883 he moved to Alexandra Road School and the following year was arrested, as one of five schoolmates charged with stealing handbags. He was given twelve strokes of the birch. In 1885 Davies wrote his first poem entitled &quot;Death.&quot;

In &quot;Poet&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (1918) Davies recalls that, at the age of 14, he was left with orders to sit with his dying grandfather. He missed the final moments of his grandfather&#x27;s life as he was too engrossed in reading &quot;a very interesting book of wild adventure.&quot;

===Delinquent to &quot;supertramp&quot;===
After school, Davies worked as an ironmonger. In November 1886 his grandmother signed Davies up for a five-year apprenticeship to a local picture-frame maker. Davies never enjoyed the craft. He left Newport, took casual work and began his travels. &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot; (1908) covers his American life in 1893–1899, including adventures and characters from his travels as a drifter. During the period, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean at least seven times on cattle ships. He travelled through many states doing seasonal work.

Davies took advantage of the corrupt system of &quot;boodle&quot; to pass the winter in Michigan by agreeing to be locked in a series of jails. Here with his fellow tramps Davies enjoyed relative comfort in &quot;card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences, and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk.&quot; At one point on his way to Memphis, Tennessee, he lay alone in a swamp for three days and nights suffering from malaria.
The turning point in Davies&#x27;s life came after a week of rambling in London. He spotted a newspaper story about the riches to be made in the Klondike and set off to make his fortune in Canada. Attempting with a fellow tramp, Three-fingered Jack, to jump a freight train at Renfrew, Ontario on 20 March 1899, he lost his footing and his right foot was crushed under the wheels of the train. The leg was amputated below the knee and he wore a pegleg thereafter. Davies&#x27; biographers agree the accident was crucial, although Davies played down the story. Moult begins his biography with the incident, and his biographer Richard J. Stonesifer suggested this event, more than any other, led Davies to become a professional poet. Davies writes, &quot;I bore this accident with an outward fortitude that was far from the true state of my feelings. Thinking of my present helplessness caused me many a bitter moment, but I managed to impress all comers with a false indifference... I was soon home again, away less than four months; but all the wildness was taken out of me, and my adventures after this were not of my seeking, but the result of circumstances.&quot; Davies took an ambivalent view of his disability. In his poem &quot;The Fog&quot;, published in the 1913 &quot;Foliage&quot;, a blind man leads the poet through the fog, showing the reader how someone impaired in one domain may have a big advantage in another.

===Poet===
Davies returned to Britain, to a rough life largely in London shelters and doss-houses, including a Salvation Army hostel in Southwark known as &quot;The Ark&quot;, which he grew to despise. Fearing the reaction of his fellow tramps to his writings, Davies would pretend to sleep, while composing his poems in his head, for later transcription in private. At one point, he borrowed money to print some, which he attempted to sell door-to-door. The effort was not successful and Davies burned all of the printed sheets.

Davies self-published his first slim book of poetry, &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Destroyer&quot;, in 1905, again by means of his savings. It proved to be the beginning of success and a growing reputation. To publish it, Davies forwent his allowance to live as a tramp for six months (with the first draft of the book hidden in his pocket), just to secure a loan of funds from his inheritance. After it was published, the volume was ignored. He resorted to posting individual copies by hand to prospective wealthy customers chosen from the pages of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, asking them to send the price of the book, a half crown, in return. He sold 60 of the 200 copies printed. One of the copies went to Arthur St John Adcock, then a journalist with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. On reading the book, he later wrote in his essay &quot;Gods of Modern Grub Street&quot;, Adcock said he &quot;recognised there were crudities and doggerel in it, there was also in it some of the freshest and most magical poetry to be found in modern books.&quot; He sent the price of the book, then asked Davies to meet him. Adcock is seen as &quot;the man who discovered Davies.&quot; The first trade edition of &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Destroyer&quot; was published by Alston Rivers in 1907. A second edition followed in 1908 and a third in 1910. A 1906 edition, by Fifield, was advertised but has not been verified.

===Rural life in Kent===
On 12 October 1905 Davies met Edward Thomas, then literary critic for the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; in London, who did more to help him than anyone else. Thomas rented for Davies the tiny two-roomed Stidulph&#x27;s Cottage in Egg Pie Lane, not far from his own home at Elses Farm near Sevenoaks in Kent. Davies moved to the cottage from 6 Llanwern Street, Newport, via London, in the second week of February 1907. The cottage was &quot;only two meadows off&quot; from Thomas&#x27;s house.

In 1907, the manuscript of &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot; drew the attention of George Bernard Shaw, who agreed to write a preface (largely through the efforts of his wife Charlotte). It was only through Shaw that Davies&#x27; contract with the publishers was rewritten to retain him the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of 15 per cent of selling price, and a non-returnable advance of £25. Davies was also to be given a say in the style of illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, rejected the new terms and the book passed to the London publisher Fifield.

Several anecdotes of Davies&#x27;s time with the Thomas family appear in a brief account later published by Thomas&#x27;s widow Helen. In 1911, he was awarded a Civil List pension of £50, later increased to £100 and then to £150.

Davies began to spend more time in London and make literary friends and acquaintances. Despite an aversion to giving his own autograph, he began a collection of his own. The &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; editor Edward Marsh helped him to obtain that of D. H. Lawrence, which Davies was particularly keen to have, and subsequently arranged a meeting between Davies, Lawrence and Lawrence&#x27;s wife-to-be Frieda. Lawrence was initially impressed but his view changed after reading &quot;Foliage&quot; and he later described Davies&#x27; &quot;Nature Poems&quot; as &quot;so thin, one can hardly feel them.&quot;

By this time Davies had a library of some fifty books at his cottage, mostly 16th and 17th-century poets, among them Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Byron, Burns, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, Blake and Herrick. In December 1908 his essay &quot;How It Feels To Be Out of Work&quot;, described by Stonesifer as &quot;a rather pedestrian performance&quot;, appeared in &quot;The English Review&quot;. He continued to send other periodical articles to editors, but without success.

===Social life in London===

After lodging at several addresses in Sevenoaks, Davies moved back to London early in 1914, settling eventually at 14 Great Russell Street in the Bloomsbury district. He lived there from early 1916 until 1921 in a small apartment, initially accompanied by an infestation of rodents, and adjacent to rooms occupied by a loud, Belgian prostitute. During this London period, Davies embarked on a series of public readings of his work, alongside others such as Hilaire Belloc and W. B. Yeats, impressing fellow poet Ezra Pound. He soon found he could socialise with leading society figures of the day, including Arthur Balfour and Lady Randolph Churchill. While in London he also took up with artists such as Jacob Epstein, Harold and Laura Knight, Nina Hamnett, Augustus John, Harold Gilman, William Rothenstein, Walter Sickert, Sir William Nicholson and Osbert and Edith Sitwell. He enjoyed the society and conversation of literary men, particularly in the rarefied downstairs at the Café Royal. He also met regularly with W. H. Hudson, Edward Garrett and others at The Mont Blanc in Soho.
For his poetry Davies drew much on experiences with the seamier side of life, but also on his love of nature. By the time he took a prominent place in the Edward Marsh &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; series, he was an established figure, generally known for the opening lines of the poem &quot;Leisure&quot;, first published in &quot;Songs of Joy and Others&quot; in 1911: &quot;What is this life if, full of care / We have no time to stand and stare...&quot;

In October 1917 his work appeared in the anthology &quot;Welsh Poets: A Representative English selection from Contemporary Writers&quot; collated by A. G. Prys-Jones and published by Erskine Macdonald of London.

In 1921, Davies moved to 13 Avery Row, Brook Street, renting from Quaker poet Olaf Baker. He was finding work difficult with rheumatism and other ailments. Harlow (1993) lists a total of 14 BBC broadcasts of Davies reading his work made between 1924 and 1940 (now held in the BBC broadcast archive) though none included his most famous work, &quot;Leisure&quot;. &quot;Later Days&quot;, a 1925 sequel to &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot;, describes the beginnings of Davies&#x27;s writing career and his acquaintance with Belloc, Shaw, de la Mare and others. He became &quot;the most painted literary man of his day&quot;, thanks to Augustus John, Sir William Nicholson, Dame Laura Knight and Sir William Rothenstein. Epstein&#x27;s bronze of Davies&#x27;s head was a successful smaller work.

===Marriage and later life===

On 5 February 1923, Davies married 23-year-old Helen Matilda Payne at the Register Office, East Grinstead, Sussex, and the couple set up home in the town at Tor Leven, Cantelupe Road. According to a witness, Conrad Aiken, the ceremony found Davies &quot;in a near panic&quot;.

Davies&#x27;s book &quot;Young Emma&quot; was a frank, often disturbing account of his life before and after picking Helen up at a bus-stop in the Edgware Road near Marble Arch. He had caught sight of her just getting off the bus and describes her wearing a &quot;saucy-looking little velvet cap with tassels&quot;. Still unmarried, Helen was pregnant at the time. While living with Davies in London, before the couple were married, Helen suffered a miscarriage. Davies initially planned on publication of the book, and sent it to Jonathan Cape in August 1924. He later changed his mind and asked for its return, and for the destruction of all copies. Cape in fact retained the copies and, after Davies&#x27;s death, asked George Bernard Shaw as to the advisability of publication. Shaw gave a negative reply and the work remained unpublished until after Helen&#x27;s death in 1979.

The couple lived quietly and happily, moving from East Grinstead to Sevenoaks, then to Malpas House, Oxted in Surrey, and finally to a string of five residences at Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, the first being a comfortable, detached 19th-century stone-built house. Axpills (later known as Shenstone), with a garden of character. He lived in several houses, all close to one another, in his last seven years. His last home was the small roadside cottage Glendower in the hamlet of Watledge. The couple had no children.

In 1930 Davies edited the poetry anthology &quot;Jewels of Song&quot; for Cape, choosing works by over 120 poets, including William Blake, Thomas Campion, Shakespeare, Tennyson and W. B. Yeats. Of his own poems he added only &quot;The Kingfisher&quot; and &quot;Leisure&quot;. The collection reappeared as &quot;An Anthology of Short Poems&quot; in 1938.

===Decline and death===

In September 1938, Davies attended the unveiling of a plaque in his honour at the &quot;Church House Inn&quot;; poet laureate, John Masefield, gave an address. Davies was unwell; the unveiling was his last public appearance.

Prior to his marriage, Davies often stayed in London with his friend Osbert Sitwell and Sitwell&#x27;s brother Sacheverell. They enjoyed walks along the River Thames and attended musical recitals given by Violet Gordon-Woodhouse. Having moved to Watledge, these friendships continued. Some three months before his death, Davies was visited at Glendower by Gordon-Woodhouse and the Sitwells, Davies being too ill to travel. Sitwell noted that Davies looked &quot;very ill&quot;, but that &quot;his head, so typical of him in its rustic and nautical boldness, with the black hair now greying a little, but as stiff as ever, surrounding his high bony forehead, seemed to have acquired an even more sculptural quality.&quot; Helen privately told Sitwell that Davies&#x27; heart showed &quot;alarming symptoms of weakness&quot; caused, according to doctors, by the continuous dragging weight of his wooden leg. Helen kept the true extent of the medical diagnosis from her husband.

Davies himself confided in Sitwell:

I&#x27;ve never been ill before, really, except when I had that accident and lost my leg... And, d&#x27;you know, I grow so irritable when I&#x27;ve got that pain, I can&#x27;t bear the sound of people&#x27;s voices... Sometimes I feel I should like to turn over on my side and die.
Davies&#x27; health continued to decline and he died in September 1940 at the age of 69. Never a churchgoer in adult life, he was cremated at the Bouncer&#x27;s Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham, and his remains interred there.

===Glendower===
From 1949, Glendower was the home of the poet&#x27;s great-nephew Norman Phillips. In 2003, following a heart attack, Phillips moved into supported accommodation. A support group of local residents, The Friends of Glendower, was established to raise funds for renovation, with the aims of enabling Phillips to return to the cottage and for it to be a commemoration of Davies&#x27; life and work. In 2012 signed copies of five of Davies&#x27; books were found during restoration, together with personal papers. By 2017, remedial work on the cottage was sufficiently advanced to allow Phillips to return.

==Literary style==
Davies&#x27;s main biographer Stonesifer compared the realism, directness and simplicity of Davies&#x27; prose to that of Defoe and George Borrow. His style was described by Shaw as that of &quot;a genuine innocent&quot;, while the biographer L. Hockey said, &quot;It is as a poet of nature that Davies has become most famous; and it is not surprising that he should have taken nature as his main subject.&quot;

For his honorary degree in 1926, Davies was introduced at the University of Wales by Professor W. D. Thomas. Thomas&#x27; citation attempted a summary of Davies&#x27; themes, style and tone:

&quot;A Welshman, a poet of distinction, and a man in whose work much of the peculiarly Welsh attitude to life is expressed with singular grace and sincerity. He combines a vivid sense of beauty with affection for the homely, keen zest for life and adventure with a rare appreciation of the common, universal pleasures, and finds in those simple things of daily life a precious quality, a dignity and a wonder that consecrate them. Natural, simple and unaffected, he is free from sham in feeling and artifice in expression. He has re-discovered for those who have forgotten them, the joys of simple nature. He has found romance in that which has become commonplace; and of the native impulses of an unspoilt heart, and the responses of a sensitive spirit, he has made a new world of experience and delight. He is a lover of life, accepting it and glorying in it. He affirms values that were falling into neglect, and in an age that is mercenary reminds us that we have the capacity for spiritual enjoyment.&quot;
Davies&#x27; friend and mentor, the poet Edward Thomas, drew a comparison with the work of Wordsworth: &quot;He can write commonplace or inaccurate English, but it is also natural to him to write, such as Wordsworth wrote, with the clearness, compactness and felicity which make a man think with shame how unworthily, through natural stupidity or uncertainty, he manages his native tongue. In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?&quot;

Daniel George, reviewing the 1943 &quot;Collected Poems&quot; for &quot;Tribune&quot;, called Davies&#x27; work &quot;new yet old, recalling now Herrick, now Blake – of whom it was said, as of Goldsmith, that he wrote like an angel but according to those who had met him talked like poor Poll, except that he was no parrot of other people&#x27;s opinions.&quot;

==Appearance and character==
Osbert Sitwell, a close friend, thought Davies bore an &quot;unmistakable likeness&quot; to his distant actor cousin Henry Irving. Sitwell described him as having a &quot;long and aquiline&quot; face and &quot;broad-shouldered and vigorous&quot;.

In an introduction to his 1951 &quot;The Essential W. H. Davies&quot;, Brian Waters said Davies&#x27;s &quot;character and personality rather than good looks were the keynote to his expressive face.&quot;

==Honours, memorials and legacy==
In 1926 Davies received a degree of Doctor Litteris, honoris causa, from the University of Wales. He returned to his native Newport in 1930, where he was honoured with a luncheon at the Westgate Hotel. His return in September 1938 for the unveiling of the plaque in his honour proved to be his last public appearance.

The National Library of Wales holds a large collection of Davies manuscripts. Items include poems such as a copy of &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Sorrow&quot;, a 16-line poem about the death of a neighbor which appears never to have been published and a collection, &quot;Quiet Streams&quot;, again with some unpublished poems. Other materials include an archive of press cuttings, a collection of personal papers and letters, and a number of photographs of Davies and his family, as well as a sketch of him by William Rothenstein.
Davies&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot; influenced a generation of British writers, including Gerald Brenan (1894–1987).

In 1951 Jonathan Cape published &quot;The Essential W. H. Davies&quot;, selected and introduced by Brian Waters, a Gloucestershire poet and writer whose work Davies admired, who described him as &quot;about the last of England&#x27;s professional poets&quot;. The collection included &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-tramp&quot;, and extracts from &quot;Beggars&quot;, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;Later Days&quot;, &quot;My Birds&quot; and &quot;My Garden&quot;, along with over 100 poems arranged by period of publication period.

Many Davies poems have been set to music. &quot;Money, O!&quot; was set for voice and piano in G minor, by Michael Head, whose 1929 Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection included settings for &quot;The Likeness&quot;, &quot;The Temper of a Maid&quot;, &quot;Natures&#x27; Friend&quot;, &quot;Robin Redbreast&quot; and &quot;A Great Time&quot;. &quot;A Great Time&quot; has also been set by Otto Freudenthal (born 1934), Wynn Hunt (born 1910) and Newell Wallbank (born 1914). There are also three songs by Sir Arthur Bliss: &quot;Thunderstorms&quot;, &quot;This Night&quot;, and &quot;Leisure&quot;, and &quot;The Rain&quot; for voice and piano, by Margaret Campbell Bruce, published in 1951 by J. Curwen and Sons.

The experimental Irish folk group Dr. Strangely Strange sang and quoted from &quot;Leisure&quot; on their 1970 album &quot;Heavy Petting&quot;, with harmonium accompaniment. A musical adaptation of this poem with John Karvelas (vocals) and Nick Pitloglou (piano) and an animated film by Pipaluk Polanksi can be found on YouTube. Again in 1970, Fleetwood Mac recorded &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, a song with lyrics from Davies&#x27;s 1927 poem &quot;The Dragonfly&quot;, as did the English singer-songwriter and instrumentalist Blake for his 2011 album &quot;The First Snow&quot;. In 1970 British rock band Supertramp named themselves after &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot;.
On 3 July 1971 a commemorative postmark was issued by the UK Post Office for Davies&#x27;s centenary.

A controversial statue by Paul Bothwell-Kincaid, inspired by the poem &quot;Leisure&quot;, was unveiled in Commercial Street, Newport in December 1990, to mark Davies&#x27;s work, on the 50th anniversary of his death. The bronze head of Davies by Epstein, from January 1917, regarded by many as the most accurate artistic impression of Davies and a copy of which Davies owned himself, may be found at Newport Museum and Art Gallery, donated by Viscount Tredegar).

In August 2010 the play &quot;Supertramp, Sickert and Jack the Ripper&quot; by Lewis Davies included an imagined sitting by Davies for a portrait by Walter Sickert. It was first staged at the Edinburgh Festival.

<text>National Socialist Party of Tripura is a political party in the Indian state of Tripura. NSPT was formed when Hirendra Tripura and others broke away from the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura in the summer of 2003. One of the principal leaders of INPT, Shyamcharan Tripura, took the side of NSPT. With the help of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) members in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC), the NSPT were quickly able to win control of the TTAADC.

In the 2005 elections to the TTAADC, the NSPT contested four seats, supported by the Left Front. All four candidates were elected.

In spite of the name, the party has no connection with Nazism or any other European use of the term &quot;National Socialism&quot;.

<text>Angelo F. Taylor (born December 29, 1978) is an American track and field athlete, winner of 400-meter hurdles at the 2000 and 2008 Summer Olympics. His personal record for the hurdles event is 47.25 seconds. His time puts him in a tie with Félix Sánchez for the #14 performer of all time. Sánchez also won two Olympic gold medals, in 2004 between Taylor&#x27;s two golds and 2012, immediately following. Taylor also has a 400-meter dash best of 44.05 seconds, ranking him as the joint 29th performer of all time, superior to any other athlete who has made a serious effort in the 400 metres hurdles. He won the bronze medal in the 400 m at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics.

He is a three-time world champion in the 4×400 m relay with the United States (2007, 2009 and 2011), and was also a relay gold medalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics.

Since 2019, Taylor has been serving a ban from the United States Center for SafeSport for his 2006 criminal convictions involving minors.

==Career==
===Early life===
Born in Albany, Georgia, Angelo Taylor studied at the Georgia Institute of Technology and won the NCAA title in 1998 and placed second in 1997. In 1998, Taylor also won a silver medal at the US National Championships. He went on to win the title three times from 1999 to 2001.

Taylor made his debut in a major international meet at the 1999 World Championships, where he finished third in his heat in 400 m hurdles, but ran a third leg at the gold medal-winning US 4x400 m relay team.

===2000 Olympic champion===
In 2000, Taylor ran a world-leading time at the Olympic Trials and entered the Sydney Games as a favorite. In a thrilling final, Taylor moved from fourth place to first over the final two hurdles and barely edged Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Hadi Souan Somayli by 0.03 seconds in the closest finish in the history of the event. Taylor ran in the heat and semifinal of 4x400 m relay race, the finals team for which won the gold medal. On August 2, 2008, the International Olympic Committee stripped the gold medal from the U.S. men&#x27;s 4x400-meter relay team, after Antonio Pettigrew admitted using a banned substance. Three of the four runners in the event final, including Pettigrew and twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison, and preliminary round runner Jerome Young, all have admitted or tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Only Taylor and world record holder Michael Johnson were not implicated.

Taylor was eliminated in the semifinals of the 2001 World Championships in 400 m hurdles while struggling with a sinus infection and flu, but won a gold as a member of US 4x400 m relay team. He didn&#x27;t make the US World Championships team in 2003 and was unsuccessful in defending his Olympic title at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing fourth in the semifinal.

===Second Olympic title===
In 2007 Taylor set a new personal best in the 400 m and won the American title in the event. He won the 400 m bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka and won another gold medal as part of the USA 4×400m relay team.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Taylor became a double Olympic champion, winning gold in the 400 metre hurdles and the 4×400 m relay. At the 2009 World Championships in Athletics he failed to make it out of the heats of the hurdles, but was part of the American 4×400 m relay team which successfully defended its world title.

Taylor finished second in the 200m at the 2010 Rieti IAAF Grand Prix in August with a new personal record time of 20.23 seconds. He fell behind Kerron Clement and Bershawn Jackson in the hurdles rankings that year, but in the 2010 IAAF Diamond League he managed top three finishes in Lausanne, Monaco and Stockholm. He had a season&#x27;s best of 47.79 seconds for the event that year. He also had two podium finishes in the 400 m, coming second at the Golden Gala and third in a season&#x27;s best of 44.72 seconds at the Weltklasse Zurich.

He came third in the 400 m hurdles at the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships with a season&#x27;s best run of 47.94 seconds, gaining a place on the national team. He won at the Herculis meeting in July, but did not peak for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, where he finished seventh in the final. He performed well in the relay, however, taking the United States to victory in a time of 2:59.31 minutes alongside Greg Nixon, Bershawn Jackson and LaShawn Merritt.

Taylor began his 2012 season with a runner-up finish at the Mt. SAC Relays. He was third over 400 m at the Doha 2012 Diamond League meet and won the first 400 m hurdles race in Shanghai.

===2012 London Summer Olympics===
Taylor was captain of the USA men&#x27;s track Olympic squad in his fourth Olympics. The two-time 400m hurdles gold medalist finished fifth in the event in a time of 48.25. In the 4x400m relay finals, Taylor ran the anchor leg and was given the lead but was chased down by the Bahamas, so the USA team won the silver medal.

==Statistics==
===Personal bests===
==Personal life==
Taylor currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia with wife Lynnita and is father to twin boys Xzaviah and Isaiah. His father, Angelo Taylor Sr., was also involved in sports and he competed in football and track at Albany State University. His family spent time living in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s as he was training and setting his sights on the Olympics.

===SafeSport suspension===
On May 16, 2019, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; published an exposé of the failure of the United States Center for SafeSport to suspend Taylor after receiving notification of his 2006 criminal convictions, for contributing to the delinquency of two 15-year old girls, as required by the United States Center for SafeSport code. USA Track &amp; Field issued a &quot;provisional suspension&quot; for Taylor later that day. He was placed on USATF&#x27;s list of suspended individuals, where as of February 2025 he still remained. SafeSport officially noted Taylor&#x27;s violation that same day, and declared him ineligible, with the announced reason being &quot;Criminal Disposition – involving minor&quot;.

<doc id="993137" wikidata="Q6024624" url="?curid=993137" title="Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra">
<text>The Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (abbr. INPT) was a political party in the Indian state of Tripura. Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl was the president of the party. It merged with the Tipraha Indigenous Progressive Alliance (TIPRA) party on 11 June 2021.

==History==
The INPT was formed as a merger of the Indigenous People&#x27;s Front of Tripura and the Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti in 2002.

The formation of the INPT was pushed through after pressure from the underground National Liberation Front of Tripura, who wanted to unite all tribal nationalist forces in a single party. The INPT was commonly and wrongly perceived as the political wing of NLFT.

==Prominent politicians==

* Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl, former militant chief of Tripura National Volunteers
* Jagadish Debbarma, former chairman of the TTAADC from 1990 to 1995
* Shyama Charan Tripura

==Past results==
===TTAADC===
As IPFT had a majority in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council, INPT came to govern that institution until 2003.

INPT suffered a serious setback in the summer of 2003, when a group of TTAAADC members under the leadership of Hiren Tripura broke away and formed the National Socialist Party of Tripura. One high-ranking INPT leader, Shyamcharan Tripura, took the side of the dissidents. NSPT were able to, with support from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) members in TTAADC, to win a majority in the assembly and INPT formed the opposition.

===Tripura State Legislative Assembly===
In the state assembly elections in 2003 INPT was allied with the Indian National Congress. INPT launched 18 candidates and Congress 42. Six INPT candidates were elected, and in total the party received 189 186 votes. The elections were won by the Left Front. After the 12th Assembly Election held in 2018, INPT has no representatives in the Tripura State Legislative Assembly.

===Lok Sabha (parliamentary elections)===
Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 INPT joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance. INPT supported the Nationalist Trinamool Congress and BJP candidates in the election.

<doc id="993141" wikidata="Q1758028" url="?curid=993141" title="1980 Turkish coup d'état">
<text>The 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état (), headed by Chief of the General Staff General Kenan Evren, was the third coup d&#x27;état in the history of the Republic of Turkey, the previous having been the 1960 coup and the 1971 coup by memorandum.

During the Cold War era, Turkey saw political violence (1976–1980) between the far-left, the far-right (Grey Wolves), the Islamist militant groups, and the state. The violence saw a sharp downturn for a period after the coup, which was welcomed by some for restoring order by quickly executing 50 people and arresting 500,000, of which hundreds would die in prison.

For the next three years the Turkish Armed Forces ruled the country through the National Security Council, before democracy was restored with the 1983 Turkish general election. This period saw an intensification of the Turkish nationalism of the state, including banning the Kurdish language. Turkey partially returned to democracy in 1983 and fully in 1989.

==Prelude==

The 1970s in Turkey was characterized by political turmoil and violence. Since 1968–69, a proportional representation system had made it difficult for any one party to achieve a parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other social classes such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms sought by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others. 
By the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems, facing strike actions, and the partial paralysis of parliamentary politics. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey had been unable to elect a president during the six months preceding the coup.

In 1975 conservative Justice Party () leader Süleyman Demirel was succeeded as prime minister by the leader of the social-democratic Republican People&#x27;s Party (), Bülent Ecevit.

Demirel formed a coalition with the Nationalist Front (), the National Salvation Party (, an Islamist party led by Necmettin Erbakan), and the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (, MHP) led by Alparslan Türkeş.

The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war between the rival factions. Politicians seemed unable to stem the growing violence in the country.

The elections of 1977 had no winner. At first, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front. But in 1978, Ecevit once again took power with the help of some deputies who had moved from one party to another, until 1979, when Demirel once again became prime minister.

Unprecedented political violence erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day. Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves, the youth organisation of the MHP, claimed they were supporting the security forces. According to the anti-fascist &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine, in 1978 there were 3,319 fascist attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded.

In the central trial against the radical left-wing organization Devrimci Yol (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court, the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. Other killings couldn&#x27;t be definitely connected, but were most likely politically inspired. The 1977 Taksim Square massacre, the 1978 Bahçelievler massacre, and the 1978 Maraş massacre stood out. Following the Maraş massacre, martial law was announced in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. By the time of the coup, it had been extended to 20 provinces.

Ecevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by Nuri Gündeş of the National Intelligence Organization , (MİT)). Ecevit told his interior minister, İrfan Özaydınlı, who then passed the news on to Sedat Celasun—one of the five generals who would lead the coup. (The deputy undersecretary of the MİT, Nihat Yıldız, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result).

==Coup==

On 11 September 1979, General Kenan Evren ordered a hand-written report from full general Haydar Saltık on whether a coup was in order or the government merely needed a stern warning. The report, which recommended preparing for a coup, was delivered in six months. Evren kept the report in his office safe. Evren says the only other person beside Saltık who was aware of the details was Nurettin Ersin. It has been argued that this was a plot on Evren&#x27;s part to encompass the political spectrum, as Saltık was close to the left, while Ersin took care of the right. Backlash from political organizations after the coup would therefore be prevented.

On 21 December, the War Academy generals convened to decide the course of action. The pretext for the coup was to put an end to the social conflicts of the 1970s, as well as the parliamentary instability. They resolved to issue the party leaders (Süleyman Demirel and Bülent Ecevit) a memorandum by way of the president, Fahri Korutürk, which was done on 27 December. The leaders received the letter a week later.

A second report, submitted in March 1980, recommended undertaking the coup without further delay, otherwise apprehensive lower-ranked officers might be tempted to &quot;take the matter into their own hands&quot;. Evren made only minor amendments to Saltık&#x27;s plan, titled &quot;Operation Flag&quot; ().

The coup was planned to take place on 11 July 1980, but was postponed after a motion to put Demirel&#x27;s government to a vote of confidence was rejected on 2 July. At the Supreme Military Council meeting () on 26 August, a second date was proposed: 12 September.

On 7 September 1980, Evren and the four service commanders decided that they would overthrow the civilian government. On 12 September, the National Security Council (, MGK), headed by Evren declared coup d&#x27;état on the national channel. The MGK then extended martial law throughout the country, abolished the Parliament and the government, suspended the Constitution and banned all political parties and trade unions. They invoked the Kemalist tradition of state secularism and in the unity of the nation, which had already justified the precedent coups, and presented themselves as opposed to communism, fascism, separatism and religious sectarianism.

The nation learned of the coup at 4:30 AM UTC+3 on the state radio address announcing that the parliament had been dismissed and that the country was under the control of the Turkish Armed Forces. According to the Armed Forces broadcast, the coup was needed to save the Turkish Republic from political fragmentation, violence and the economic collapse that was created by political mismanagement. Kenan Evren was appointed head of the National Security Council ().

==Effects==

In the days following the coup the NSC suspended parliament, disbanded all political parties and took their leaders in custody. Workers&#x27; strikes were made illegal and labor unions were suspended. Local governors, mayors and public servants were replaced by military personnel. Curfews were imposed in the evenings under the declared state of emergency and leaving the country was prohibited. By the end of 1982 over 120,000 people had been imprisoned.

Istanbul was served by three military mayors between 1980 and 1984. They renamed the leftist shantytowns changing names like &quot;1 Mayıs Mahallesi&quot; (Eng.: &quot;1st of May Neighborhood&quot;) to &quot;Mustafa Kemal Mahallesi&quot; (Eng.: &quot;Mustafa Kemal Neighborhood&quot;), as a symbol of the military rule.

===Economy===
One of the coup&#x27;s most visible effects was on the economy. On the day of the coup, it was on the verge of collapse, with triple-digit inflation. There was large-scale unemployment and a chronic foreign trade deficit. The economic changes between 1980 and 1983 were credited to Turgut Özal. In 1979, Özal became an undersecretary in Demirel&#x27;s minority government until the coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the 24 January decisions, which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in Ulusu&#x27;s government and continued to implement economic reforms. Özal supported the International Monetary Fund, and to this end he forced the resignation of the director of the Central Bank, İsmail Aydınoğlu, who opposed it.

The strategic aim was to unite Turkey with the &quot;global economy,&quot; which big business supported, and gave Turkish companies the ability to market products and services globally. One month after the coup, London&#x27;s &quot;International Banking Review&quot; wrote &quot;A feeling of hope is evident among international bankers that Turkey&#x27;s military coup may have opened the way to greater political stability as an essential prerequisite for the revitalization of the Turkish economy&quot;. During 1980–1983, the foreign exchange rate was allowed to float freely. Foreign investment was encouraged. The national establishments, initiated by Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, were promoted to involve joint enterprises with foreign establishments. The 85% pre-coup level government involvement in the economy forced a reduction in the relative importance of the state sector. Just after the coup, Turkey revitalized the Atatürk Dam and the Southeastern Anatolia Project, which was a land reform project promoted as a solution to the underdeveloped Southeastern Anatolia. It was transformed into a multi-sector social and economic development program, a sustainable development program, for the 9 million people of the region. The closed economy, produced for only Turkey&#x27;s need, was subsidized for a vigorous export drive.

The drastic expansion of the economy during this period was relative to the previous level. The GDP remained well below those of most Middle Eastern and European countries. The government froze wages while the economy experienced a significant decrease of the public sector, a deflationist policy, and several successive mini-devaluations.

===Tribunals===
The coup rounded up members of both the left and right for trial with military tribunals. Within a very short time, there were 250,000 to 650,000 people detained. Among the detainees, 230,000 were tried, 14,000 were stripped of citizenship, and 50 were executed. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people were tortured, and thousands disappeared. A total of 1,683,000 people were blacklisted. Apart from the militants killed during shootings, at least four prisoners were legally executed immediately after the coup; the first ones since 1972, while in February 1982 there were 108 prisoners condemned to capital punishment. Among the prosecuted were Ecevit, Demirel, Türkeş, and Erbakan, who were incarcerated and temporarily suspended from politics.

One notable victim of the hangings was a communist militant alleged 17-year-old Erdal Eren, who said he looked forward to it in order to avoid thinking of the torture he had witnessed. According to official records he was born in 1961. He was accused of killing a Turkish soldier. Kenan Evren said &quot;Now, after I catch him, I will put him on trial, and then I will not execute him, I will take care of him for life. I will feed that traitor who took a gun to these Mehmetçiks who shed their blood for this homeland for years. Would you agree to that?!&quot;

After having taken advantage of the Grey Wolves&#x27; activism, General Kenan Evren imprisoned hundreds of them. At the time they were some 1700 Grey Wolves organizations in Turkey, with about 200,000 registered members and a million sympathizers. In its indictment of the MHP in May 1981, the Turkish military government charged 220 members of the MHP and its affiliates for 694 murders. Evren and his cohorts realized that Türkeş was a charismatic leader who could challenge their authority using the paramilitary Grey Wolves. Following the coup in Colonel Türkeş&#x27;s indictment, the Turkish press revealed the close links maintained by the MHP with security forces as well as organized crime involved in drug trade, which financed in return weapons and the activities of hired fascist commandos all over the country.

===Constitution===
Within three years the generals passed some 800 laws in order to form a militarily disciplined society. The coup members were convinced of the unworkability of the existing constitution. They decided to adopt a new constitution that included mechanisms to prevent what they saw as impeding the functioning of democracy. On 29 June 1981 the military junta appointed 160 people as members of an advisory assembly to draft a new constitution. The new constitution brought clear limits and definitions, such as on the rules of election of the president, which was stated as a factor for the coup d&#x27;état.

On 7 November 1982 the new constitution was put to a referendum, which was accepted with 92% of the vote. On 9 November 1982 Kenan Evren was appointed President for the next seven years.

=== Education ===
The junta made mandatory the lesson named &quot;Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge&quot;, which in practice centers around Sunni Islam.

==Aftermath==
After the approval by referendum of the new Constitution in June 1982, Kenan Evren organized general elections, held on 6 November 1983. This democratization has been criticized by the Turkish scholar Ergun Özbudun as a &quot;textbook case&quot; of a junta&#x27;s dictating the terms of its departure.

The referendum and the elections did not take place in a free and competitive setting. Many political leaders of pre-coup era (including Süleyman Demirel, Bülent Ecevit, Alparslan Türkeş and Necmettin Erbakan) had been banned from politics, and all new parties needed to get the approval of the National Security Council in order to participate in the elections. Only three parties, two of which were actually created by the junta, were permitted to contest.

The secretary general of the National Security Council was general Haydar Saltık. Both he and Evren were the strong men of the regime, while the government was headed by a retired admiral, Bülend Ulusu, and included several retired military officers and a few civil servants. Some alleged in Turkey, after the coup, that General Saltuk had been preparing a more radical, rightist coup, which had been one of the reasons prompting the other generals to act, respecting the hierarchy, and then to include him in the MGK in order to neutralize him.

Out of the 1983 elections came one-party governance under Turgut Özal&#x27;s Motherland Party, which combined a neoliberal economic program with conservative social values.

Yıldırım Akbulut became the head of the Parliament. He was succeeded in 1991 by Mesut Yılmaz. Meanwhile, Süleyman Demirel founded the center-right True Path Party in 1983, and returned to active politics after the 1987 Turkish referendum.

Yılmaz redoubled Turkey&#x27;s economic profile, converting towns like Gaziantep from small provincial capitals into mid-sized economic boomtowns, and renewed its orientation toward Europe. But political instability followed as the host of banned politicians reentered politics, fracturing the vote, and the Motherland Party became increasingly corrupt. Özal, who succeeded Evren as President of Turkey, died of a heart attack in 1993, and Süleyman Demirel was elected president.

The Özal government empowered the police force with intelligence capabilities to counter the National Intelligence Organization, which at the time was run by the military. The police force even engaged in external intelligence collection.

===Trial of coup leaders===
After the 2010 constitutional referendum, an investigation was started regarding the coup, and in June 2011, the Specially Authorized Ankara Deputy Prosecutor&#x27;s Office asked ex-prosecutor to forward a copy of an indictment he had prepared for Kenan Evren. Kayasu had previously been fired for trying to indict Evren in 2003.

In January 2012, a Turkish court accepted the indictments against General Kenan Evren and General Tahsin Şahinkaya, the only coup leaders still alive at the time, for their role in the coup. Prosecutors sought life sentences against the two retired generals. According to the indictment, a total of 191 people died in custody during the aftermath of the coup, due to &quot;inhumane&quot; acts. The trial began on 4 April 2012. In 2012, a court case was launched against Şahinkaya and Kenan Evren relating to the 1980 military coup. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 June 2014 by a court in Ankara. But neither of the two was sent to prison as both were in hospitals for medical treatment. Şahinkaya died in the Gülhane Military Medical Academy Hospital (GATA) in Haydarpaşa, Istanbul on 9 July 2015. Evren died at a military hospital in Ankara on 9 May 2015, aged 97. His sentence was on appeal at the time of his death.

==Allegations of U.S. involvement==
There have been allegations of American involvement in the coup. Involvement was alleged to have been acknowledged by the CIA Ankara station chief Paul B. Henze. In his 1986 book &quot;12 Eylül: saat 04.00&quot; journalist Mehmet Ali Birand wrote that after the government was overthrown, Henze cabled Washington, saying, &quot;our boys did it.&quot; On a June 2003 interview to Zaman, Henze denied American involvement stating &quot;I did not say to Carter &#x27;Our boys did it.&#x27; It is totally a tale, a myth, it is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it&quot;. Two days later Birand replied on CNN Türk&#x27;s &quot;Manşet&quot; by saying &quot;It is impossible for me to have fabricated it, the American support to the coup and the atmosphere in Washington was in the same direction. Henze narrated me these words despite he now denies it&quot; and presented the footage of an interview with Henze recorded in 1997 according to which another diplomat rather than Henze informed the president, saying &quot;Boys in Ankara did it.&quot; However, according to the same interview, Henze, the CIA and the Pentagon did not know about the coup beforehand. Some Turkish media sources reported it as &quot;Henze indeed said Our boys did it&quot;, while others simply called the statement an urban legend.

The US State Department itself announced the coup during the night between 11 and 12 September: the military had phoned the US embassy in Ankara to alert them of the coup an hour in advance. Both in his press conference held after the government was overthrown and when interrogated by public prosecutor in 2011 General Kenan Evren said &quot;the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.&quot;

Tahsin Şahinkaya – then general in charge of the Turkish Air Forces who is said to have travelled to the United States just before the coup, told the US army general was not informed of the upcoming coup and the general was surprised to have been uninformed of the coup after the government was overthrown.
Michael Butter argued that outside of some anecdotes, there was no proof of American involvement.

<doc id="993153" wikidata="Q1520777" url="?curid=993153" title="Certainty">
<text>Certainty (also known as epistemic certainty or objective certainty) is the epistemic property of beliefs which a person has no rational grounds for doubting. One standard way of defining epistemic certainty is that a belief is certain if and only if the person holding that belief could not be mistaken in holding that belief. Other common definitions of certainty involve the indubitable nature of such beliefs or define certainty as a property of those beliefs with the greatest possible justification. Certainty is closely related to knowledge, although contemporary philosophers tend to treat knowledge as having lower requirements than certainty.

Importantly, epistemic certainty is not the same thing as psychological certainty (also known as subjective certainty or certitude), which describes the highest degree to which a person could be convinced that something is true. While a person may be completely convinced that a particular belief is true, and might even be psychologically incapable of entertaining its falsity, this does not entail that the belief is itself beyond rational doubt or incapable of being false. While the word &quot;certainty&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a person&#x27;s &quot;subjective&quot; certainty about the truth of a belief, philosophers are primarily interested in the question of whether any beliefs ever attain &quot;objective&quot; certainty.

The philosophical question of whether one can ever be truly certain about anything has been widely debated for centuries. Many proponents of philosophical skepticism deny that certainty is possible, or claim that it is only possible in &quot;a priori&quot; domains such as logic or mathematics. Historically, many philosophers have held that knowledge requires epistemic certainty, and therefore that one must have infallible justification in order to count as knowing the truth of a proposition. However, many philosophers such as René Descartes were troubled by the resulting skeptical implications, since all of our experiences at least seem to be compatible with various skeptical scenarios. It is generally accepted today that most of our beliefs are compatible with their falsity and are therefore fallible, although the status of being certain is still often ascribed to a limited range of beliefs (such as &quot;I exist&quot;). The apparent fallibility of our beliefs has led many contemporary philosophers to deny that knowledge requires certainty.

== Ludwig Wittgenstein – 20th century ==

&quot;On Certainty&quot; is a series of notes made by Ludwig Wittgenstein just prior to his death. The main theme of the work is that context plays a role in epistemology. Wittgenstein asserts an anti-foundationalist message throughout the work: that every claim can be doubted but certainty is possible in a framework. &quot;The function [propositions] serve in language is to serve as a kind of framework within which empirical propositions can make sense&quot;.

==Degrees of certainty==
Physicist Lawrence M. Krauss suggests that the need for identifying degrees of certainty is under-appreciated in various domains, including policy-making and the understanding of science. This is because different goals require different degrees of certaintyand politicians are not always aware of (or do not make it clear) how much certainty we are working with.

Rudolf Carnap viewed certainty as a matter of degree (&quot;degrees of certainty&quot;) which could be objectively measured, with degree one being certainty. Bayesian analysis derives degrees of certainty which are interpreted as a measure of subjective psychological belief.

Alternatively, one might use the legal degrees of certainty. These standards of evidence ascend as follows: no credible evidence, some credible evidence, a preponderance of evidence, clear and convincing evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, and beyond any shadow of a doubt (i.e. &quot;undoubtable&quot;recognized as an impossible standard to meetwhich serves only to terminate the list).

If knowledge requires absolute certainty, then knowledge is most likely impossible, as evidenced by the apparent fallibility of our beliefs.

==Foundational crisis of mathematics==

The &quot;foundational crisis of mathematics&quot; was the early 20th century&#x27;s term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.

After several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be stated within mathematics itself began to be heavily challenged.

One attempt after another to provide unassailable foundations for mathematics was found to suffer from various paradoxes (such as Russell&#x27;s paradox) and to be inconsistent.

Various schools of thought were opposing each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert&#x27;s program, which sought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a formal system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L.E.J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols. The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;, the leading mathematical journal of the time.

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, proved in 1931, showed that essential aspects of Hilbert&#x27;s program could not be attained. In Gödel&#x27;s first result he showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable systemsuch as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetica statement that can be shown to be true, but that does not follow from the rules of the system. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth cannot be reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert&#x27;s program. In a next result Gödel showed that such a system was not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. This proves that there is no hope to &quot;prove&quot; the consistency of any system that contains an axiomatization of elementary arithmetic, and, in particular, to prove the consistency of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), the system which is generally used for building all mathematics.

However, if ZFC is not consistent, there exists a proof of both a theorem and its negation, and this would imply a proof of all theorems and all their negations. As, despite the large number of mathematical areas that have been deeply studied, no such contradiction has ever been found, this provides an almost certainty of mathematical results. Moreover, if such a contradiction would eventually be found, most mathematicians are convinced that it will be possible to resolve it by a slight modification of the axioms of ZFC.

Moreover, the method of forcing allows proving the consistency of a theory, provided that another theory is consistent. For example, if ZFC is consistent, adding to it the continuum hypothesis or a negation of it defines two theories that are both consistent (in other words, the continuum is independent from the axioms of ZFC). This existence of proofs of relative consistency implies that the consistency of modern mathematics depends weakly on a particular choice on the axioms on which mathematics are built.

In this sense, the crisis has been resolved, as, although consistency of ZFC is not provable, it solves (or avoids) all logical paradoxes at the origin of the crisis, and there are many facts that provide a quasi-certainty of the consistency of modern mathematics.

<doc id="993154" wikidata="Q57632" url="?curid=993154" title="Maria Feodorovna, Empress of Russia">
<text>Maria Feodorovna (; née Duchess Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg; 25 October 1759 – 5 November 1828 [OS 24 October]) became Empress of Russia as the second wife of Emperor Paul I. She founded the Office of the Institutions of Empress Maria.

Daughter of Duke Frederick Eugene of Württemberg and Princess Friederike of Brandenburg-Schwedt, Sophie Dorothea belonged to a junior branch of the House of Württemberg and grew up in Montbéliard, receiving an excellent education for her time. After Grand Duke Paul (the future Paul I of Russia) became a widower in 1776, King Frederick II of Prussia (Sophie Dorothea&#x27;s maternal great-uncle) and Empress Catherine II of Russia chose Sophie Dorothea as the ideal candidate to become Paul&#x27;s second wife. In spite of her fiancé&#x27;s difficult character, she developed a long, peaceful relationship with Paul and converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1776, adopting the name &quot;Maria Feodorovna&quot;. During the long reign (1762–1796) of her mother-in-law, she sided with her husband and lost the initial affection the reigning Empress had for her. The couple were completely excluded from any political influence, as mother and son mistrusted each other. They were forced to live in isolation at Gatchina Palace, where they had many children together.

After her husband ascended the Russian throne in 1796, Maria Feodorovna had a considerable and beneficial influence during his four-year reign. On the night of Paul I&#x27;s assassination (), she thought to imitate her mother-in-law&#x27;s example and claim the throne, but her son, the future Emperor Alexander I, dissuaded her. She instead instituted the precedence whereby the Empress dowager out-ranked the reigning monarch&#x27;s wife, a system unique to the Russian court. Clever, purposeful and energetic, Maria Feodorovna founded and managed all the Russian Empire&#x27;s charitable establishments, re-modelled the palaces of Gatchina and Pavlovsk, and encouraged foreign links directed against Napoleon I of France. She often gave political counsel to her children, who held her in great respect. The imperial family deeply mourned her death, and her successors regarded her as a role model.

==Childhood==

Sophie Marie Dorothea Auguste Luise was born on 25 October 1759 in Stettin, Kingdom of Prussia (now Poland). She was the eldest daughter of the eight children born from Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, and Princess Friederike of Brandenburg-Schwedt, niece of King Frederick II of Prussia. In 1769, her family took up residence in the ancestral castle at Montbéliard, then an exclave of the Duchy of Württemberg, today part of Franche-Comté. The family&#x27;s summer residence was situated at Étupes.

Montbéliard not only was the seat of the junior branch of the House of Württemberg, but a cultural center frequented by many intellectual and political figures. Sophie Dorothea&#x27;s education was better than average, to the point that she cultivated her skills with great enthusiasm. By the age of 16, she was well-versed in mathematics and architecture, as well as fluent in German, French, Italian, and Latin. She was brought up according to French etiquette as custom of that era, but with German bourgeois simplicity. She was known to be thoughtful, organized, strong-willed, constant, and tender.

In 1773, Sophie Dorothea was among the group of German princesses considered as possible wives of the heir to the Russian throne, the future Tsar Paul I. However, Sophie was not yet 14 years old at the time and thus Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, a princess of a more appropriate age, was chosen instead. At the age of 16, Sophie Dorothea became tall, buxom and rosy-cheeked with a sunny disposition, although extremely shortsighted and inclined to be stout. She was engaged to Prince Louis of Hesse, the brother of the Tsarevich&#x27;s first wife.

==Grand Duchess==

===Engagement===
After the Tsarevich became a widower in 1776, Frederick II of Prussia proposed his grandniece as the ideal candidate to be Paul&#x27;s second wife. Russian Empress, Catherine II, was delighted with the idea: The Princess of Württemberg shared with her not only a similar education, but also the same original name and place of birth. When her mother lamented the unfortunate destiny of some Russian sovereigns, a pleased Sophie Dorothea replied that her only concern was to make her way in her new country quickly and successfully. Her former fiancé received a monetary compensation when the engagement was broken.

Sophie and Paul met for the first time at a state dinner given in honour of his arrival in Berlin. Having learned that her fiancé&#x27;s tastes were serious, she spoke about geometry during their first interview. The next day, she wrote a glowing letter to a friend in which she declared that &quot;I am more than content. The Grand Duke could not be more kind. I pride myself on the fact that my dear bridegroom loves me a great deal, and this makes me very, very fortunate.&quot; Paul was as happy with the young princess as she was with him and wrote to his mother that: &quot;I found my intended to be such as I could have dreamed of. She is shapely, intelligent, quick-witted, and not at all shy.&quot;

===First years===
By early fall, Sophie fell in love with her future husband. &quot;I cannot go to bed, my dear and adored Prince, without telling you once again that I love and adore you madly,&quot; she wrote to Paul. Soon after arriving at St Petersburg, she converted to the Russian Orthodox Church, took the name &quot;Maria Feodorovna,&quot; and was granted the title Grand Duchess of Russia, with the style &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;. The wedding took place on 26 September 1776. Despite Paul&#x27;s difficult and often tyrannical character, Maria Feodorovna never changed her feelings. Her even temper and patience were instrumental in knowing how to deal with a difficult husband and moderate the extreme elements in his character. She wrote to a friend: &quot;My dear husband is a perfect angel and I love him to distraction.&quot;

As Grand Duchess, Maria Feodorovna possessed such parsimony that she was prepared to spend the whole day in full dress without fatigue and implacably imposed the same burden on her entourage. She didn&#x27;t hesitate to take over the clothes of her husband&#x27;s first wife and dispute with her ladies-in-waiting the defunct Natalia&#x27;s slippers. At the beginning, Catherine II was enchanted with her daughter-in-law, about whom she wrote to a friend: &quot;I confess to you that I am infatuated with this charming Princess, but literally infatuated. She is precisely what one would have wished: the figure of a nymph, a lily and rose complexion, the loveliest skin in the world, tall and well built; she is grateful; sweetness, kindnesses and innocence are reflected in her face.&quot;

However, the relationship between the two women quickly turned sour: Maria Feodorovna sided with her neglected husband in the family&#x27;s acrimony and despite her good intentions to ease the difficult situation, meddling only aggravated their differences. In December 1777, she gave birth to the first of her ten children, future Tsar Alexander I. Just three months later, Catherine II took the newborn to raise him without interference from the parents. When a second son was born in April 1779, she did the same thing. This caused bitter animosity with Maria, who was only allowed weekly visits with Paul. For the next four years, the couple didn&#x27;t have any more children. Deprived of her sons, Maria occupied herself by decorating Pavlovsk Palace, Catherine&#x27;s gift to celebrate the birth of her first grandson.

===European tour===
Tired of being excluded in political affairs, Paul and Maria asked Catherine for permission to travel abroad to Western Europe. In September 1781, under the pseudonyms of &quot;the Count and Countess Severny&quot;, the Tsarevich and his wife set off on a journey that lasted fourteen months and took them to Poland, Austria, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. Paris made a special impression on the couple, who visited King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. While Louis got along well with Paul, Marie Antoinette felt intimidated and nervous when she met Maria, a known intellectual who exhibited confidence. The conversation would turn lively later and the queen gave the grand duchess a toilette set with the Württemberg arms printed on it. In Austria, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II compared Maria with her husband and found her superior.

During their visit to Italy, the couple proved to be much in love since Paul could not stop giving kisses in public to his wife, surprising their travelling companions. On their way back to Saint Petersburg, Maria went to Württemberg to visit her parents. At the end of 1782, the couple returned to Russia and devoted their attention to Pavlovsk Palace, where Maria gave birth to Alexandra Pavlovna, the first of six daughters she would bear during the next twelve years. To celebrate Alexandra&#x27;s birth, Catherine II gave them the Palace of Gatchina, which would occupy their attention until they were called to the throne. She let the parents raise their daughters and younger sons. From then on the Russian Imperial house would be a large family.

===Last years===
During the long years of Catherine&#x27;s reign, Maria and Paul were forced to live in isolation in Gatchina with a tight income. Unlike the Romanovs, Maria was frugal, a rare virtue in a princess of that time only developed because of her large family that for a long time was only a minor royal branch. She continued to beautify Pavlovsk, dedicated herself to charitable work among its inhabitants, planned theatrical events for her husband, who delighted in that amusement, and participated in musical evenings for family and friends in which she adeptly played the harpsichord. She was devoted to expanding her modest literary salon, which was frequented by poet Vasily Zhukovsky, fabulist Ivan Krylov, and historian Nikolai Karamzin. Maria prided herself in being more clever than her mother-in-law and never lost the opportunity of contrasting her impeccable virtue with the failings of the reigning Empress. She was equally watchful to attack Catherine&#x27;s favourites, Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin and Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov.

Maria Feodorovna kept voluminous diaries that recorded her life in detail, but her son Nicholas I burned all these volumes after her death according to her last wishes. Even most of the letters she wrote have not survived since she usually requested that they be burnt. The relationship between Paul and Catherine Nelidova, one of Maria&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, was the cause of the first crack in their marriage during those years. The intense liaison was particularly painful for Maria, as the other woman had been her friend. Although Paul said that his relations with Nelidova were only platonic, Maria&#x27;s own relationship with Nelidova became very bitter for several years. However, she eventually joined forces with her former friend in an attempt to moderate her husband&#x27;s increasingly neurotic temperament.

==Empress of Russia==
After twenty years in the shadows, the death of Catherine II in 1796 allowed Maria Feodorovna to have a prominent role as Empress consort. During Catherine&#x27;s lifetime, Maria had no chance of interfering in affairs of state, as Paul himself was excluded, but after her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne, she took to politics, at first timidly, but increasingly resolutely afterwards. Her influence over her husband was very great, and in general beneficial. Even so, it is possible that she abused it in order to help her friends or hurt her enemies. Although the imperial couple wasn&#x27;t as close as they once had been, there remained a good deal of respect, dependence and warmth between them. Their relationship suffered further in the last years of Paul&#x27;s life. After Maria gave birth to her tenth and last child in 1798, Paul became infatuated with 19-year-old Anna Lopukhina and lied to his wife that the relationship was of a paternal nature. Paul was Emperor for four years, four months, and six days. He was murdered on 11 March 1801.

On the night of her husband&#x27;s assassination, Maria Feodorovna thought to imitate the example of her mother-in-law and tried to seize power to become empress regnant on the grounds that she had been crowned with Paul. It took her son Alexander several days to persuade her to relinquish her reckless claim, for which she had no party to support her. For some time afterward, whenever her son came to visit, the Dowager Empress would place a casket between them containing the bloodstained nightshirt that his father was wearing on the day of the murder as a silent reproach. The strained relationship between mother and son improved though and thanks to the new Tsar, 42-years-old Maria Feodorovna kept the highest female position at court and often took the emperor&#x27;s arm in public ceremonies, while Empress Elizabeth had to walk behind. This custom of precedence and superiority of the Dowager Empress over the reigning monarch&#x27;s wife was introduced by Maria and was unique to the Russian court, though it caused resentment with her eldest daughter-in-law. Perpetuating the tradition of Catherine II, she attended parades in military uniform, the cordon of an order across her breast.

===Charity institutions===

In May 1797, Tsar Paul asked Maria Feodorovna to oversee the national charities. She encouraged a thorough inspection of prospective foster parents and limited admissions &quot;from the street&quot;, measures which decreased the inflow of new orphans and considerably reduced mortality. By 1826, the mortality rate was reduced to 15% per annum, a figure outrageous by modern standards but a great improvement on the 18th century.

Even after her husband&#x27;s death, Maria Feodorovna continued to manage all the empire&#x27;s charitable establishments and control the bank for loans. By 1828, their total assets exceeded 359 million roubles, the largest capital assets in all of Moscow. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Board of Trustees capitalized on the recent disaster by building cheap rental housing on its properties. As a result of this policy, the new facilities housed up to 8,000 residents of all ranks in the 1820s. These institutions existed until the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Maria Feodorovna realized the need to downsize the institution, separating children from older tenants and improving the educational program for the former. She transferred the younger inhabitants to new, independent orphanages. The Moscow Crafts College, the largest spin-off, was established as an orphanage for teenagers in 1830 and continues today as the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. In the orphanage, there were high-level educational programs along the lines of the &quot;Latin classes for boys and the &quot;midwife classes for girls&quot;. After meeting a deaf boy, Maria established the first Russian school for the deaf in 1807 and supported the career of the blind musician Charlotta Seuerling, whose mother she saved from ruin. Shortly before Empress Maria&#x27;s death, the Orphanage took the ablest children from the streets and prepared them for professional careers. Among the teachers were Sergey Solovyov, Alexander Vostokov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Nicholas Benois, and Vasily Vereshchagin.

===Building projects===

Maria Feodorovna had exceptional taste. She was skilled at architecture, watercolor; engraving; designing objects of ivory and amber; and horticulture. The palaces of Pavlovsk, Gatchina, Tsarskoye Selo, the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, and the Hermitage were remodelled and furnished under her personal guidance. Her efforts would produce some of the most beautiful estates in all of Russia.

Maria Fedorovna and Paul began remodelling Pavlovsk. She insisted in having several rustic structures which recalled the palace where she grew up at Étupes, 40 miles from Basel. During their travels in 1781, the couple sent back and forth drawings, plans and notes on the smallest details. She brought Italian architect Carlo Rossi to redesign the library to contain more than twenty thousand books. After Paul&#x27;s death in 1801, Gatchina Palace came into the ownership of the new Dowager Empress, who used her experience from her travels around Europe to redo the interiors in the Neoclassical style and make alterations to adapt it &quot;in case of winter stay&quot; in 1809.

===Foreign relationships===
Maria Feodorovna enjoyed a considerable income which made possible for her to live in grand style. Her elegant receptions, where she appeared sumptuously dressed and was surrounded by chamberlains, were in sharp contrast with the simple court life of Alexander I, whose retiring ways and the withdrawn personality of his wife were no match for the Dowager Empress&#x27; old splendor in the style of the time of Catherine the Great. Her exalted position made her palace at Pavlovsk a mandatory place to visit for the great personages of Saint Petersburg. She used her position to help as much as possible her numerous poor relations, some of whom were invited to Russia. Examples include her brother, Prince Alexander of Württemberg (1771–1833).

Maria Feodorovna transformed her court into the center of anti-Napoleon sentiment during the Napoleonic Wars and vehemently opposed any approach her son made to get to an agreement with Napoleon Bonaparte. When the French Emperor offered to marry her youngest daughter Anna Pavlovna, Maria strongly opposed the proposed marriage.

==Dowager Empress and death==
Even past age 50, Maria Feodorovna retained traces of her youthful freshness. Of a robust constitution, she outlived five of her ten children, including her eldest son and his wife, and saw the ascension to the throne of her third son, Nicholas I. Once all her children were grown up, she maintained an avid correspondence with them, but both mother and children could be cool and remote at times because of their temperaments.

In 1822, Empress Maria Feodorovna moved into the renovated Yelagin Palace, but died in Winter Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russia, on 5 November 1828, at the age of 69. She outlived half of her children. Her memory was revered by her children, who named their eldest daughters in her honour except for Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna. Later Russian tsarinas looked up to her and used her as a role model. Pavlovsk Palace, in which Maria lived for so long and on which she left a major imprint, was maintained for her descendants as she left it, almost as a family museum, in accordance with her instructions, first by her younger son Michael and later by the Konstantinovich branch of the family, who inherited and kept it until the Russian Revolution.

==Issue==

Throughout her marriage with Paul I of Russia, Maria Feodorovna had ten children.

Maria Feodorovna was a considerate, loving mother who managed to maintain genuinely close relationships with all her children despite the fact that Catherine II took over her two eldest sons in their early years. The future of her daughters and the education of her younger sons kept Maria&#x27;s attention occupied during the first years of her widowhood. She had total control over the future Nicholas I and Grand Duke Michael. She was influential in the early education of her grandson, the future Alexander II. Maria tried to surpass the education which Catherine II had provided for her two eldest sons, but didn&#x27;t choose the best teachers for the younger ones.

<text>Janganotantrik Morcha (People&#x27;s Democratic Front) is a political party in the Indian state of Tripura. PDF was formed by Ajoy Biswas, a former member of the Lok Sabha of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). Biswas broke out of CPI(M) against ideological differences with then Chief Minister Nripen Chakraborty.

The PDF-breakaway affected the teachers movement of CPI(M) in the state. Both teachers organizations of CPI(M), Tripura Government Teachers Association (state schools) and Tripura Teachers Association (private schools) were divided. The CPI(M) loyalists were called TGTA (H.G.B. Road) and TTA (H.G.B. Road) whereas the followers of Biswas were called TGTA (Ajoy Biswas) and TTA (Ajoy Biswas).

Biswas later broke with PDF and formed Tripura Ganatantrik Manch.

Janganotantrik Morcha participates in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists.

The symbol of PDF is a red banner with a hammer and sickle (same as CPI(M)).

<text>The Jacobean era was the period in English and Scottish history that coincides 
with the reign of James VI of Scotland who also inherited the crown of England in 1603 as James I. The Jacobean era succeeds the Elizabethan era and precedes the Caroline era. The term &quot;Jacobean&quot; is often used for the distinctive styles of Jacobean architecture, visual arts, decorative arts, and literature which characterized that period.

The word &quot;Jacobean&quot; is derived from Neo-Latin &quot;Jacobaeus&quot; from &quot;Jacobus&quot;, the Ecclesiastical Latin form of the English name James.

==James as King of England==
The practical if not formal unification of England and Scotland under one ruler was an important shift of order for both nations, and would shape their existence to the present day. Another development of crucial significance was the foundation of the first British colonies on the North American continent; Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, Newfoundland in 1610, and Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620, which laid the foundation for future British settlement and the eventual formation of both Canada and the United States of America. In 1609 the Parliament of Scotland began the Plantation of Ulster.

A notable event of James&#x27; reign occurred on 5 November 1605. On that date, a group of English Catholics (including Guy Fawkes) attempted to assassinate the King and destroy Parliament in the Palace of Westminster. However, the Gunpowder Plot was exposed and prevented, and the convicted plotters were hanged, drawn, and quartered.

Historians have long debated the curious characteristics of the king&#x27;s ruling style. Croft says:
:The pragmatism of &#x27;little by little&#x27; was coming to characterise his style of governance. At the same time, the curious combination of ability and complacency, idleness and shrewd judgement, warm emotions and lack of discretion so well described by Fontenay remained typical of James throughout his life.

===Royal finances===
Political events and developments of the Jacobean era cannot be understood separately from the economic and financial situation. James was deeply in debt in Scotland, and after 1603 he inherited an English debt of £350,000 from Elizabeth. By 1608 the English debt had risen to £1,400,000 and was increasing by £140,000 annually. Through a crash program of selling off royal demesnes, Lord Treasurer Robert Cecil reduced the debt to £300,000 and the annual deficit to £46,000 by 1610—but could not follow the same method of relief much farther. The result was a series of tense and often failed negotiations with Parliament for financial supports, a situation that deteriorated over the reigns of James and his son and heir Charles I until the crisis of the English Civil War.

The Jacobean era ended with a severe economic depression in 1620–1626, complicated by a serious outbreak of bubonic plague in London in 1625.

===Foreign policy===
King James I was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms but for Europe as a whole. He called himself &quot;Rex Pacificus&quot; (&quot;King of Peace&quot;). Europe was deeply polarized, and on the verge of the massive Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. In 1604, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his daughter to the Spanish prince. The marriage of James&#x27; daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine at Whitehall 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple&#x27;s union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the Union of German Protestant Princes, headquartered in Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatine. King James calculated that his daughter&#x27;s marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus would have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his naïveté, he did not realize that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving destruction of the other side. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor Ferdinand II, the Vienna-based leader of the Habsburgs who controlled the Holy Roman Empire, were both heavily influenced by the Catholic Counter-Reformation. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.

Lord Buckingham, who wielded increasing influence at court, wanted an alliance with Spain. Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the princess, the Infanta Maria Anna. However, Spain&#x27;s terms were that James must drop Britain&#x27;s anti-Catholic intolerance. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated. Buckingham subsequently became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to give military support for their cause. His son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years&#x27; War began as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of Bohemia and massacred their followers. Catholic Bavaria then invaded the Palatine, and James&#x27;s son-in-law begged for James&#x27;s military intervention. James finally realized his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the Europe-wide war that proved so devastating for three decades. James&#x27;s backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favored with the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.

Frederick and Elizabeth&#x27;s election as King and Queen of Bohemia in 1619, and the conflict that resulted, marked the beginning of the disastrous Thirty Years&#x27; War. King James&#x27; determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the &quot;war fever&quot; of 1623, appears in retrospect as one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign.

==High culture==
===Literature===
In literature, some of Shakespeare&#x27;s most prominent plays, including &quot;King Lear&quot; (1605), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606), and &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1610), were written during the reign of James I. Patronage came not just from James, but from James&#x27; wife Anne of Denmark. Also during this period were powerful works by John Webster, Thomas Middleton, John Ford and Ben Jonson. Ben Jonson also contributed to some of the era&#x27;s best poetry, together with the Cavalier poets and John Donne. In prose, the most representative works are found in those of Francis Bacon and the King James Bible.

In 1617 George Chapman completed his monumental translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; into English verse, which were the first ever complete translations of either poem, both central to the Western Canon, into the English language. The wildly popular tale of the Trojan War had until then been available to readers of English only in medieval epic retellings such as Caxton&#x27;s &quot;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot;.

Jonson was also an important innovator in the specialised literary subgenre of the masque, which went through an intense development in the Jacobean era. His name is linked with that of Inigo Jones as co-developers of the literary and visual/technical aspects of this hybrid art. (For Jonson&#x27;s masques, see: &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot;, &quot;The Masque of Queens&quot;, etc.) The high costs of these spectacles, however, positioned the Stuarts far from the relative frugality of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and alienated the middle classes and the Puritans with a prospect of waste and self-indulgent excess.

===Science===
Francis Bacon had a strong influence in the evolution of modern science, which was entering a key phase in this era, as the work of Johannes Kepler in Germany and Galileo Galilei in Italy brought the Copernican revolution to a new level of development. Bacon laid a foundation, and was a powerful and persuasive advocate for modern objective inquiry, predicated upon empiricism as a lens to study the natural world. This school of thought was in stark contrast to the dominating scientific philosophy of the time: Medieval scholastic authoritarianism. On practical rather than general levels, much work was being done in the areas of navigation, cartography, and surveying—John Widdowes&#x27; &quot;A Description of the World&quot; (1621) being one significant volume in this area—as well as in continuing William Gilbert&#x27;s work on magnetism from the previous reign. Scholarship and the sciences, or &quot;natural philosophy&quot;, had important royal patrons in this era—not so much in the King but in his son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and even his wife, Anne of Denmark.

===Arts and architecture===

The fine arts were dominated by foreign talent in the Jacobean era, as was true of the Tudor and Stuart periods in general. Paul van Somer and Daniel Mytens were the most prominent portrait painters during the reign of James, as Anthony van Dyck would be under the coming reign of his son. Yet the slow development of a native school of painting, which had made progress in the previous reign, continued under James, producing figures like Robert Peake the Elder (died 1619), William Larkin (fl. 1609–19), and Sir Nathaniel Bacon (1585–1627). Some would also claim, as part of this trend, Cornelius Johnson, or Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen (1593–1661), born and trained in London and active through the first two Stuart reigns.

The decorative arts – furniture, for example – became increasingly rich in color, detail, and design. Materials from other parts of the world, like mother-of-pearl, were now available by worldwide trade and were used as decoration. Even familiar materials, such as wood and silver, were worked more deeply in intricate and intensely three-dimensional designs. The goldsmith George Heriot made jewellery for Anne of Denmark.

Architecture in the Jacobean era was a continuation of the Elizabethan style with increasing emphasis on classical elements like columns and obelisks. Architectural detail and decorative strapwork patterns derived from continental engravings, especially the prints of Hans Vredeman de Vries, were employed on buildings and furniture. European influences include France, Flanders, and Italy. Inigo Jones may be the most famous English architect of this period, with lasting contributions to classical public building style; his works include the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall and the portico of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (destroyed in the Great Fire of London). Significant Jacobean buildings include Hatfield House, Bolsover Castle, Aston Hall, and Charlton House. Many churches contain fine monuments in Jacobean style, with characteristic motifs including strapwork, and polychromy. The mason and sculptor Nicholas Stone produced many effigies for tombs as well as architectural stonework.

==In popular culture==
In the domain of customs, manners, and everyday life, the Jacobean era saw a distinctly religious tone. Virginia tobacco became popular. James I published his &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot; in 1604, but the book had no discernible effect; by 1612, London had 7,000 tobacconists and smoking houses. The Virginia colony survived because the English acquired the nicotine habit.

<text>Reit im Winkl is a small village (locally known as a snow-magnet) located on the German/Austrian border in the southeastern part of Bavaria, Germany. Part of the Traunstein district, it was previously an immigration and customs control point (prior to the formation of the Schengen Zone). It is situated south of Chiemsee and southwest of Ruhpolding – home of the Biathlon World Cup – in the Bavarian Alps and facing towards Tyrol. The village lies next to the Austrian states Tyrol and Salzburg. Kössen in Tyrol is the next village on the river Lofer, before it joins the confluence of the river Tiroler Achen. Reit im Winkl has a population of approximately 2,600.

Reit im Winkl is well known as both a certified place of restorative and curative air (Luftkurort) and a ski resort, offering alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, both classical and skating, and snow-boarding, as well as mountain trekking and hiking. It achieved, in 2012, Germany&#x27;s first-ever Premium Winter Trails Certification. Snowfall is always plentiful and predictable (even when surrounding areas are bare of snow, Reit im Winkl can be sure of sufficient snow to create premier skiing conditions – in 2012 Reit im Winkl had the deepest snow of 120 cm for a plateau area, which occurred in February, long after snow had melted elsewhere in the region. Reit im Winkl has two alpine skiing areas: 1) Three lifts in the suburb of Blindau (Benzeck) as well as a snow-tubing lift, and the large plateau skiing area at Winklmoos Alm which connects with Steinplatte in Austria and is reached by the recently completed, state-of-the-art gondola cableway (bubble lift) from Seegatterl.

In summer, Reit im Winkl enjoys one of the highest counts of sunny days in Bavaria, and is popular with mountain bike and nordic walking enthusiasts. Visitors can enjoy swimming in either of the three alpine lakes (Weitsee, Mittersee and Loedensee) northeast of Seegatterl, or try their luck at fishing in the trout lake.

Reit im Winkl is popularly known to locals and return visitors as Germany&#x27;s own Tyrol, and boasts its own home-grown regional specialities such as &quot;Heumilch&quot; cheese (cheese made from cows fed exclusively hay pasture), &quot;heuschnapps&quot; (a liqueur in which mountain hay and herbs are soaked to produce a distinctive and sweet taste of hay) and &quot;Reiberdatschi&quot; (grated potatoes mixed with a little egg and flour and poured as a flat mass into a skillet and fried), popularly eaten with apple mousse.

==Suburbs==
Reit im Winkl is divided into the suburbs Birnbach, Blindau, Entfelden, Groissenbach, Oberbichl, Seegatterl, Unterbichl and Winklmoos Alm.

==History==

The first signs of settlement in Reit im Winkl are in the 12th century. The date of the foundation is 1160 when Otto de Rute was named in a document. The accuracy of the document is disputed and some historians put the beginning of the settlement to the middle of the 13th century. Since then it has been part of Bavaria.

Reit im Winkl was part of the parish of Kirchdorf in Tirol which was itself part of the diocese of Chiemsee from 1275 until 1804.

Historians have assumed the location of the manor of the Herren von Reit (Lords of Reit), on a small hill above the church.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms was created 1929 replacing the old coat of arms which showed a blue chapel on a green hill. The new coat of arms shows the eagle on yellow ground of the diocese of Chiemsee in a corner (Winkl derived from the German word Winkel for corner). The burning log and the sapie (axe like tool to trail logs) on the forest green ground are symbols for the clearing of the forest to create pasture and farm land in 11th and 12th century.

==Economy==

===History===

Formerly, Reit im Winkl was mostly dependent on logging and forestry, because of the brevity of the growing season for agricultural production. Trees were logged in summer and transported to storage places with horses or by hand. Logs were transferred to neighbouring Tyrol for sale: in winter either via sleds with a man sitting in front using his feet to brake and control the sled, which resulted in severe accidents occurring regularly, or via dams which were constructed to hold the meltwater during spring in order to raft the timber down the valley – such a dam can be found on display at Winklmoss Alm. Because the orientation of the valley made it impossible to sell the rafted wood to the salt works of Bad Reichenhall or Traunstein – which had an enormous fuel consumption – logs were sent south. In one such contract the wood was sold to the silver works in the Inn valley in Tyrol and as an exchange Tyrol sold logs to the salt works in Bad Reichenhall.

===Today===

The first tourist to Reit im Winkl, in the year 1858, was King Maximilian II, as reported in the local press. The Strength Through Joy movement in the Third Reich and the closed borders after the war boosted tourism as the principal source of income in the region. Today, approximately 5000 beds for annual visitor numbers of 90 000 provides an indication of the importance of tourism for Reit im Winkl.

==Transport==

Reit im Winkl is located along the Deutschen Alpenstraße (B 305) (German Alps Road). Coming from Munich by car it can be reached either from the Munich-Salzburg highway A8 at Bernau or Chiemsee and the Tiroler Achen valley; coming from Salzburg along the Munich-Salzburg A8 at Siegsdorf or Grabenstatt via Ruhpolding, or through Bad Reichenhall via Berchtesgarden. The Maserer pass (B305, direction Marquartstein) has been renovated and widened (most recently at the end of the 20th century) – during periods of heavy snowfall, snow chains are recommended. The B305 continues through the village, across the border into Austria and follows the river Lofer river to Kössen straight into the Inn valley. Because of the need for transport capacities for the sawmills and logs from the surrounding forest a narrow gauge railway was built from Ruhpolding to Reit im Winkl in 1923. Following accidents and as a result of the high maintenance costs (winter conditions) the railway was demolished in the 1930s. The causeway is used as a bicycle trail in summer and for nordic skiing in the winter.

Apart from private car, Reit im Winkl can be reached via public transport – the RVO (Regionalverkehr Oberbayern) runs the following bus services which also connect (in the case of Prien am Chiemsee, Salzburg and Traunstein) with the Deutsche Bahn (train services).

 1. 9505 – Reit im Winkl – Prien am Chiemsee

<text>Cook is a railway station and crossing loop located in the Australian state of South Australia on the Trans-Australian Railway. It is by rail from Port Augusta, by rail from Kalgoorlie, and about north of the Eyre Highway via an unsealed road. It is on the longest stretch of straight railway in the world, at , which extends from Ooldea, South Australia to beyond Loongana, Western Australia.

Cook is the only scheduled stop on the Nullarbor Plain for the Indian Pacific transcontinental passenger train and has little other than curiosity value for passengers strolling around while their train is replenished. 

==History==
Cook was established in 1917 on the Nullarbor Plain when the Trans-Australian Railway was built. It is named after the sixth Prime Minister of Australia, Joseph Cook. When the town was a major Commonwealth Railways centre for track maintenance and locomotive and rolling stock repairs, it supported a school and hospital. At that time, railway employees and their families depended on two weekly provisions trains for the delivery of supplies. When the town was populated, water was pumped from an underground artesian aquifer but later, all water was carried in by train.

The short 1955 film &quot;Nullarbor Hideout&quot; was set in and around Cook; the first scenes give a good impression of the railway line and infrastructure, and a sense of the townspeople&#x27;s isolation and their dependence on the railway.

==After privatisation==
In 2009, Cook was said to have a resident population of four. The town was effectively closed in 1997 when the Australian National Railways&#x27; assets were sold to railway operating company Australian Southern Railroad. Ownership was later transferred to National Rail Corporation, later becoming Pacific National after a trade for the Intermodal yard facilities at Alice Springs in 2004 in preparation for the opening of the railway to Darwin. 

The reliability of modern diesel locomotives and the introduction of concrete sleepers and continuously welded rail rendered resident employees redundant. Track and facilities maintenance is undertaken by Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) and diesel refuelling facilities remain for Intermodal train services and the Indian Pacific; there is overnight accommodation for resting Pacific National train crews. 

The crossing loop can cross trains up to long. The former airstrip is known as a place to spot inland dotterel.

As of 2016, Cook was officially described as an &quot;unbounded locality&quot; which is not used as an address. Since 2013, it has been administratively classified as being in the locality of Nullarbor.

<doc id="993184" wikidata="Q5255562" url="?curid=993184" title="Díaz (surname)">
<text>Díaz is a common surname of Spanish origin with multiple meanings in multiple languages. First found in the Kingdom of Castile, where the name originated in the Visigoth period, the name accounts for about 0.17% of the Spanish population, ranking as the 14th-most frequently found surname in both 1999 and 2004.

==Variants and related names==
There is minor evidence that Díez may be equivalent to Díaz, in the form of Spanish language listing of most frequent surnames in 1999 Spain. However, a 2008 in-press academic manuscript about Spanish naming in 2004 suggests otherwise, listing statistics for &quot;Díaz&quot; and &quot;Díez&quot; separately. The surname is a cognate with the Portuguese language surname &quot;Dias&quot;.

==Usage==
&quot;Díaz&quot; and the anglicized form &quot;Diaz&quot; appear to be surnames only, without evidence for use as given names. Use of &quot;Diaz&quot; may arise through Anglicization of Portuguese language &quot;Dias&quot;.

Many examples of the surnames &quot;Díaz&quot; exist among historically notable people as a patronymic of Diego. Among the earliest such examples is El Cid, whose real name was &quot;Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar&quot;, and whose father&#x27;s given name was &quot;Diego&quot;.

==Geographical distribution==

<text>Inagua is the southernmost district of the Bahamas, comprising the islands of Great Inagua and Little Inagua. The headquarters for the district council are in Matthew Town.

==History==
The original settlers were the Lucayan people(Taíno), who arrived sometime between 500 and 800 CE, crossing in dugout canoes from Hispaniola and/or Cuba to the Bahamas. 

The larger island was initially called by the name &quot;Heneagua&quot;, which may derive from a Spanish expression meaning &#x27;water is to be found there&#x27;. Two names of apparent Lucayan origin, &quot;Inagua&quot; (meaning &quot;Small Eastern Island&quot;) and &quot;Baneque&quot; (meaning &quot;Big Water Island&quot;), were used by the Spanish to refer to Great Inagua.

Between the years of 1500 and 1825, many documented treasure laden ships were destroyed on Inaguan reefs. The two most valuable wrecks lost off the Inaguas were treasure-laden Spanish galleons: the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; in 1599; and the &quot;Infanta&quot; in 1788. Other ships of considerable value that were wrecked there include the French &quot;Le Count De Paix&quot; in 1713, the British HMS &quot;Lowestoffe&quot; in 1801, and the British HMS &quot;Statira&quot; in 1815.

As early as the 1600s, salt was being produced and shipped to Spanish colonies, and its extraction was a going business by 1803.

Henri Christophe, king of northern Haiti from 1811 to 1820, built a summer retreat at the Northeast Point of Great Inagua. Local legend has it that he also buried a cache of gold there.

By 1918, after the end of World War I, lower salt prices and competition had driven the small producers on Great Inagua out of business, and the salt works were abandoned except for incidental local use.

In 1935, the Erickson brothers from Massachusetts founded West India Chemicals Ltd., purchasing the abandoned salt works from the British government. They drilled test holes, set up offices, and began restoration of the buildings, but the locals felt threatened, fearing changes to the power structure &quot;status quo&quot;. In August 1937, a riot broke out, an employee was killed, and the Ericksons were forced to flee. They soon returned, and full-scale development resumed.

In the mid-1950s, Morton Salt bought the Great Inagua saltworks, which includes over 80 salt ponds, now the second largest such operation in North America. Morton is the major employer on the island.

==Islands==
===Great Inagua===
Great Inagua is the second largest island in the Bahamas at 596 sq mi (1544 km2) and lies about from the eastern tip of Cuba. The island is about in extent and mostly flat with some sand hills, the highest points being East Hill at , Salt Pond Hill at , and James Hill at . It encloses several lakes, most notably the long Lake Windsor (also called Lake Rosa) which occupies nearly a quarter of the interior. The population of Great Inagua is 913 (2010 census).

The island&#x27;s capital and only harbour is Matthew Town, named after George Matthew, a 19th-century Governor of the Bahamas. This town houses the Morton Salt Company’s main facility, producing one million tonnes of sea salt a year — the second largest solar saline operation in North America and Inagua&#x27;s main industry.

Great Inagua Airport (IATA: IGA, ICAO: MYIG) is located nearby.

A large bird sanctuary in the centre of the island has a population of more than 80,000 West Indian flamingoes and many other bird species, including the Bahama parrot, Inagua woodstar, Bahama pintail, brown pelican, tricolored heron, snowy egret, reddish egret, stripe-headed tanager, double-crested cormorant, Neotropic cormorant, roseate spoonbill, American kestrel, and burrowing owl. The Union Creek National Reserve is specially set aside for the study of green sea turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;).

===Little Inagua===
The neighbouring Little Inagua, to the northeast, is uninhabited and occupied by a large Land and Sea Park. It has an area of , with herds of feral donkeys and goats (descendants of stock introduced by the French). Various species of endangered sea turtles breed on the island. Little Inagua has a large protective reef extending up to away from the island in all directions, which prevents boats from coming too close.

== Politics ==
The island is part of the MICAL constituency for elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas.

<text>Henry George Kendall (30 January 1874 – 28 November 1965) was a British sea captain who survived several shipwrecks, including the collision and sinking of the ocean liner &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; in 1914 and an attack by a Kaiserliche Marine submarine during the First World War. He was also noted for his role in the capture of murderer Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen.

==Life==
===Early career===
Captain Henry Kendall began his career in sailing ships in 1888 at the age of 14. Eight years later he married Jane &quot;Minnie&quot; Jones. In 1900 he survived a shipwreck on the Newfoundland coast when he was an officer on the SS &quot;Lusitania&quot; (not the later Cunarder torpedoed in the First World War). Two years later he worked with Guglielmo Marconi to develop ship-to-shore radio before getting his first command in 1908. Two years after that he was appointed captain of the Canadian Pacific Line&#x27;s , and within months had become famous following his role in the capture of Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen, the London cellar murderer, in what was the first use of radio to capture a criminal. Kendall&#x27;s radio messages alerted Scotland Yard, and Inspector Walter Dew was dispatched to Canada on a faster ship, the White Star Line&#x27;s , and arrived in Canada before &quot;Montrose&quot;. Disguised as a pilot, Dew boarded &quot;Montrose&quot; and arrested Crippen.

===Shipwreck of RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;===

In May 1914 Kendall was appointed captain of the . Almost a month later the ship sank in Canada&#x27;s Saint Lawrence River after colliding with the , a Norwegian coal freighter with an ice-breaking bow. The accident occurred at night. The two ships were head to head when a fog bank rolled onto the river and &quot;Storstad&quot; changed position, believing &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; to be on &quot;Storstad&quot;″s port side. This turned the freighter into the side of the larger ship, which was passing on the starboard side. The damage was catastrophic and &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; sank in just 14 minutes with the loss of 1,012 people. Kendall was thrown from the bridge when the ship keeled over suddenly but survived. Subsequently, he was cleared of any responsibility for the disaster.

===Action in the First World War===
Soon afterwards he was posted to Antwerp, Belgium, where he was soon in the news again. As the Germans invaded Belgium, the British Consulate in Antwerp was besieged by around 600 refugees. Kendall worked with the consul Sir Cecil Hertslet (A Family of Librarians -see gov.uk) to formulate a plan to rescue them by using the to tow the , which was out of commission, out of the port and on to England.

Kendall then joined the crew of and served with the ship until 1918, during which time he was mentioned in despatches on several occasions. In March 1918 &quot;Calgarian&quot; was torpedoed off the Ulster coast by German submarine but Kendall survived again. He went on to serve as a King&#x27;s Messenger before being appointed Commodore of Convoys. When the war ended he was appointed Marine Superintendent at Southampton by Canadian Pacific and remained there until he moved to a similar position in London in 1924.

==Death==
He died in an English nursing home in 1965 at the age of 91. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; made no mention of the sinking of the &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;. Nurses attending Kendall on his death bed reported that in his delirium he seemed to be reliving the horror of a ship wreck.

==Descendants==
His grandson was the Anglican priest and hymn writer Canon Michael Saward, and his great-grandchildren include F1 journalist Joe Saward and the late anti-rape campaigner Jill Saward.

<text>Nitemare 3D is a horror-themed first-person shooter released by Gray Design Associates in 1994 for MS-DOS and Windows 3.x. There are three episodes with the first episode released as shareware and ten levels in each. The full release came on two 3½&quot; floppy disks with a guide to the game&#x27;s thirty levels. According to author David P. Gray, the game is the first pixelated Windows game to use the WinG interface. Along with &quot;WinDoom&quot; also from 1994, a similar first-person shooter, &quot;Bad Toys&quot;, was released for Windows 3.1 in 1995.

The visuals are similar to those used in &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; with perpendicular walls and no textures on the floors and ceilings. The music was composed by David B. Schultz who also composed for &quot;Quiver&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Nitemare 3D&quot; follows the story of Hugo, from the &quot;Hugo&quot; trilogy, a series of graphic adventure PC games consisting of &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Hugo II, Whodunit?&quot;, and &quot;Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!&quot;. Penelope, Hugo&#x27;s girlfriend, has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Hammerstein for use in heinous experiments. Hugo must battle through Hammerstein&#x27;s bizarre mansion, caverns complete with prisons and laboratories, and finally through a twisted alternate dimension of demons and aliens in an attempt to save her.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Nitemare 3D&quot;&#x27;s gameplay is puzzle-oriented. The four weapons (plasma gun, magic wand, pistol, and auto-repeat plasma gun) have different usages—for example, magic blasts are especially useful against magical creatures such as witches, whereas robots are strong against them. Meanwhile, vampires take heavy damage from silver bullets, but are strong against plasma gun. Each level in the game has numerous secret panels, some of which are for bonuses, but others are essential to completing the level. To make tasks easier, the player can collect magic eyes, which enable the player to activate a mini-map in the game&#x27;s HUD and give hints as to the locations of panels, and crystal balls for displaying the location of enemies.

In a similar vein to id Software&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;, the player character&#x27;s face is shown on the status bar and acts as a visual reflection of the player&#x27;s health. It is also similar to the early &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; games.

<text>William Cumming (July 30, 1724–1797) was an American lawyer who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress for North Carolina in 1785.

William was born in Annapolis, Maryland on July 30, 1724. He read law and practiced in Maryland for several years before he moved to Edenton, North Carolina. In North Carolina his law practice extended into several counties: Chowan, Currituck, and Pasquotank Counties.

Cumming attended the colony&#x27;s Provincial Congress in 1776 and was first elected to North Carolina&#x27;s House of Commons in 1781, and served in several other terms as well. In 1784 and 1785 the legislature named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress, but he only attended sessions of the Congress in 1785.

<doc id="993204" wikidata="Q2270201" url="?curid=993204" title="Floris and Blancheflour">
<text>Floris and Blancheflour () is the name of a popular romantic story that was told in the Middle Ages in many different vernacular languages and versions. It first appears in Europe around 1160 in &quot;aristocratic&quot; French. Roughly between the period 1200 and 1350 it was one of the most popular of all the romantic plots.

==The story of &quot;Floris and Blancheflour&quot;==
The following synopsis is from the original Old French &quot;aristocratic&quot; version (&quot;Floire et Blancheflor&quot;) of the late 12th century. The Middle English version of the poem derives from it, but differs somewhat in details. For instance, the opening section concerning how the two are born is missing from the English versions. It dates to around 1250 and was called &quot;Floris and Blanchefleur&quot;.

===Old French version===
Felix, King of al-Andalus (Muslim-ruled Iberian Peninsula), on one of his ventures into Galicia in northwestern Spain, attacks a band of Christian pilgrims en route on the Camino de Santiago to the famous pilgrimage site of Santiago de Compostela. Among the pilgrims are a French knight and his recently widowed daughter, who has chosen to dedicate the rest of her life to the sanctuary. The knight is killed, and his daughter is taken prisoner to Naples, where she is made lady-in-waiting to Felix&#x27;s wife. Both women are pregnant, and the children are born on the same day, Palm Sunday: Floris, a son, to the Muslim Queen, and Blanchefleur, a daughter, to her lady-in-waiting.

Floris (&quot;belonging to the flower&quot;) and Blanchefleur (&quot;white flower&quot;) are raised together at the court and grow close. King Felix fears his son may desire to marry the &quot;pagan&quot; girl and decides that she must be killed. However, he cannot bring himself to do the act and instead sends Floris away to school, then sells Blanchefleur to merchants traveling on the way to Cairo (called Babylon in the story), where she is then sold to the emir. Felix constructs an elaborate tomb for Blanchefleur and tells Floris she has died. Floris&#x27;s reaction is so severe that Felix tells him the truth. Distraught but encouraged she is still alive, Floris sets out to find her.

Floris eventually arrives outside Cairo, where he meets the bridge warden Daire, who tells him about the emir&#x27;s tower of maidens. Each year, the emir selects a new bride from his tower and kills his old wife. Rumour has it that Blanchefleur is soon to be his next chosen bride. To gain access to the tower, Daire advises Floris to play chess with the tower watchman, returning all winnings to him until the watchman is forced to return the favor by allowing him entrance to the tower. Floris outplays the watchmen at chess, and according to plan, Floris is smuggled into the tower in a basket of flowers but is mistakenly placed in the room of Blanchefleur&#x27;s friend Claris. Claris arranges a reunion between the two, but the emir discovers them two weeks later.

The emir holds off killing them on the spot until he holds a council of advisers. So impressed are the advisers at the willingness of the young lovers to die for one another that they persuade the emir to spare their lives. Floris is then knighted, he and Blanchefleur are married, and Claris marries the emir (who promises Claris she will be his last and only wife, forever). Soon after, news of Felix&#x27;s death reaches Cairo and Floris and Blanchefleur depart for home where they inherit the kingdom, embrace Christianity, and convert their subjects as well.

===Middle English version===
The poem tells of the troubles of the two eponymous lovers. Blancheflour is a Christian princess abducted by Saracens and raised alongside the pagan prince Flores. The two fall in love and separate. Blancheflour gives Flores a ring that will reflect her state, so that it will tarnish if she is in danger.

Blancheflour is in a different caliphate from Flores, and there she is accused falsely and sent as a slave to a Tower of Maidens. The Emir has a &quot;Tree of Love&quot; in his garden that determines a new wife for him every year. Its flower will fall on the destined maiden from the harem, and yet he can also magically manipulate the tree to cast its flower upon a favorite. He has decided to make it fall on Blancheflour, for she is the loveliest virgin in the harem. Knowing that Blancheflour is about to be taken by the Emir as a wife, Flores comes to rescue her from her peril. The reunited lovers are found in bed (though they were chastely together) by the Emir the following day. When he hears their whole tale of chaste love and long promises to one another, he demands proof of her virginity by having her put her hands in water that will stain if she has been with a man. She is proven pure; he pardons both lovers, and all is well.

==Analysis==
The story contains elements of both older heroic sagas and romance. Unlike the usually bloody and martial Romances earlier in the period (e.g. &quot;Havelok the Dane&quot;), this Romance is, indeed, romantic. The older original &quot;aristocratic&quot; version does not contain knightly combat but the &quot;popular&quot; French version that would come later does contain some elements. The story contains themes of conflict between paganism and Christianity. Additionally, unlike other Romances, each section of the story is dependent strictly upon the previous section, so this poem has a linear plot. The poem also emphasizes the power of romantic love (rather than courtly love or divine favor) over force of arms to preserve life and ensure a good end.

The Middle English version of the poem derives from an Old French &quot;aristocratic&quot; version (&quot;Floire et Blancheflor&quot;) of the tale. &quot;Floris is an oriental tale with all the indispensable wonders of the East: a garden with a magical spring and tree, a harem, eunuchs, an emir who marries a different maiden every year, and the like.&quot; The story has analogs in Indian literature, particularly the &quot;Jatakas&quot; of the early fifth century. Many of the details, such as the Tower of Maidens (i.e. harem), eunuch guards, and the odalisques derive from material carried to the west via &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. The tale could be originally French, or possibly of Oriental origins, or a synthesis of motifs.

Boccaccio wrote a version of the same tale in his &quot;Filocolo&quot;, in 1336, while he was in Naples. The tale has been a popular subject for later retellings, and it was treated by Swedish poet Oskar Levertin in the romantic ballad &quot;Flores och Blanzeflor&quot; in the collection &quot;Legender och visor&quot; (Legends and Songs) in 1891.

==Vernacular versions==

*Greek &quot;Florios kai Platziaflora, around 1400
*Castilian &quot;La Reina Jerifa Mora&quot;, before 1500, as also found in Sephardic tradition. 

Its continuing popularity is demonstrated by an allusion to it in the romance Emaré, where Floris and Blancheflour are one of the pairs of lovers embroidered on a robe, along with Tristan and Isolt, and Amadas and Idoine.

<text>Daniel Romanovich (1201–1264) was Prince of Galicia (1205–1207; 1211–1212; 1230–1232; 1233–1234; 1238–1264), Volhynia (1205–1208; 1215–1238), Grand Prince of Kiev (1240), and King of Ruthenia (1253–1264).

== Biography ==
===Early life and reign===

Daniel&#x27;s father, Roman Mstislavich, united the principalities of Galicia and Volhynia in 1199. After his death in 1205, the boyars of Galicia forced the four-year-old Daniel into exile with his mother Anna-Euphrosyne and brother Vasylko Romanovich. After the boyars proclaimed one of their own as prince, the Poles and Hungarians invaded the principality, ostensibly to support the claims of young Daniel and Vasylko, and divided it between themselves. In 1219, Danylo renounced his claims to Galicia in favor of his father-in-law, Mstislav the Bold.

In 1221, Daniel re-established his rule over Volhynia, where the boyars and populace had reaffirmed their loyalty to his dynasty. In 1223 the young prince led his troops against the Mongols as part of the coalition of Rus&#x27; princes in the Battle of Kalka, which ended in destruction of the allied force. Wounded in the fighting, Daniel was able to escape encirclement by the enemy and survived. During his rule over Volhynia the prince gave his younger brother Vasylko the principality of Lutsk. The brothers fought tohether against Jotvingians, which raided his lands. Daniel&#x27;s influence and his alliance with Polish duke Leszek the White made him a competitor to Volodymyr Rurikovich, Prince of Kyiv. After Leszek&#x27;s assassination in 1228 Daniel and Vasylko allied with the deceased prince&#x27;s brother Konrad of Masovia and campaigned together with him against Polish duke Władysław Spindleshanks. In 1230 Daniel was invited to take the throne of Halych for the second time and defeated Hungarian troops which besieged the city. However, the boyars once against plotted against the prince and helped Hungarian prince Andrew to recapture the city in 1232. In 1234 Daniel defeated Alexander Vsevolodovich, taking the Duchy of Belz. By 1238, he had defeated former Dobrzyń Knights at Drohiczyn (Dorohochyn), and regained most of Galicia, including the capital. While the Prussians were under pressure from the Teutonic Order, Daniel attempted to conquer their neighbours, the Jotvingians.

===Mongol invasions===

In 1239, with the advancing Mongols, Michael of Chernigov, the grand prince of Kiev, who was married to Daniel&#x27;s sister, quickly left Kiev and petitioned Daniel for help. Daniel dispatched his &quot;voivode&quot;, Dmytro, to defend the city. However, after a long siege, its walls were breached and, despite fierce fighting within the city, Kiev fell on 6 December 1240 and was largely destroyed. Early in the next year, April 1241, the Mongols passed through Galicia and Volhynia, destroying Halych and advancing on Poland and Hungary. Daniel and Vasylko fled to Poland, and eventually moved their capital from Halych to Kholm (modern Chełm) in late 1240 or early 1241. In his absence, Daniel appointed boyar Dobroslav Suddych to distribute lands to fellow Galician boyars in Kolomyia, but when the latter in early 1241 began allotting them to Chernigov boyars instead (possibly in collaboration with the Olgovichi prince Rostislav Mikhailovich), Daniel summoned him to Kholm and imprisoned him in late 1241.

=== Establishment of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia ===
On 17 August 1245, Daniel defeated a combined force of the prince of Chernigov, disaffected boyars, and Hungarian and Polish elements at Yaroslav, and finally took the remainder of Galicia, thus reconstituting his father&#x27;s holdings. He made his brother Vasylko the ruler of Volhynia and retained the Galician title for himself, though he continued to exercise real power in both places.
Daniel&#x27;s domestic policies focused on stability and economic growth. During his rule, German, Polish, and Rus&#x27; merchants and artisans were invited into Galicia, and numbers of Armenians and Jews established themselves in the towns and cities. Daniel founded the towns of Lviv (1256) and Kholm, naming the former for his son, and fortified many others. He appointed officials to protect the peasantry from aristocratic exploitation and formed peasant-based heavy infantry units.

Yet Daniel&#x27;s successes and his failed defense of Kiev attracted the further attention of the Mongols. In 1246, he was summoned to the capital of the Golden Horde at Sarai on the Volga River and was forced to accept Mongol overlordship. According to Ukrainian historian Orest Subtelny, Daniel was handed a cup of fermented mare&#x27;s milk by the Mongol khan, Batu, and told to get used to it, as &quot;you are one of ours now&quot;. They exchanged hostages whereby 100 families of Karaites were re-settled in Carpathian Galicia. According to James Chambers, the following dialogue took place between Batu and Daniel of Galicia: &quot;At a banquet Batu asked if he drank kumiz like the Mongols and Daniel answered: &#x27;Until now I did not, but now I do as you command and I drink it&#x27;. To which Batu replied: &#x27;You are now one of ours,&#x27; and since he was more used to it ordered that Daniel be given a goblet of wine.&quot; This was due to Daniel&#x27;s notorious love of wine.

While formally accepting the Mongols as overlords, and supplying them with soldiers as required, Daniel built his foreign policy around opposition to the Golden Horde. Suffering from raids by Lithuanians and Jotvingians, he simultaneously established cordial relations with the rulers of the Kingdom of Poland and Kingdom of Hungary, and requested aid from Pope Innocent IV in the form of a crusade. In return for papal assistance, Daniel offered to place his lands under the ecclesiastical authority of Rome, a pledge never realised. Wooed by the prospect of extending his authority, the Pope encouraged Daniel&#x27;s resistance to the Mongols and his Western orientation, and in 1253, had a papal representative crown Daniel as king at Dorohochyn, present-day Drohiczyn on the Bug River. However, Daniel wanted more than recognition, and commented bitterly that he expected an army when he received the crown. From then on, Daniel was known as &quot;rex Russiae&quot; and sometimes by the title &quot;korol&quot;.

The following year, Daniel repelled Mongol assaults led by Orda&#x27;s son, Kuremsa, on Ponyzia and Volhynia and dispatched an expedition with the aim of taking Kiev. Despite initial successes, in 1259, a Mongol force under Burundai and Nogai Khan entered Galicia and Volhynia and offered an ultimatum: Daniel was to destroy his fortifications or Burundai would assault the towns. Daniel complied and pulled down the city walls.

In the last years of his reign, Daniel engaged in dynastic politics, marrying a son and a daughter to the offspring of Mindaugas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and acquiring territorial concessions in Poland from the latter. Another daughter of his, Ustynia, was married to Andrey Yaroslavich of Vladimir-Suzdal. He also arranged for the marriage of his son Roman to Gertrude, the Babenberg heiress, but was unsuccessful in his bid to have him placed on the ducal throne of Austria.

By his death in 1264, Daniel had reconstructed and expanded the territories held by his father, held off the expansionist threats of Poland and Hungary, minimized Mongol influence in the territories of present-day western Ukraine, and raised the economic and social standards of his domains. He was succeeded in Galicia by his son Leo.

== Legacy ==

A monument to him was erected in 1998 in the city of Halych. In 2001 an equestrian statue honouring Daniel was unveiled in Lviv to commemorate 800 years from his birth.

On 7 September 2011, the parliament of Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada) issued a resolution on &quot;celebration of the 810th Anniversary of the birth of the first King of Ruthenia-Ukraine Daniel of Galicia&quot;. 

In 2012 the main airport in the city of Lviv was renamed in honour of the prince as Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport.

<text>Saint-Joseph or St.-Joseph () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. Though the appellation covers the largest amount of land, it is second in actual size under vine to Crozes-Hermitage, an appellation with which it shares much regarding style and prestige. St.-Joseph is primarily a red wine region, but also produces a white wine. The red is produced predominantly from the Syrah grape, but AOC regulations allow up to 10% of Marsanne or Roussanne. The white wine is made exclusively from the latter grape varieties.

==History==
Originally known as Vin de Mauves and mentioned in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, the wine from St.-Joseph was a favourite in the French court of Louis XII (1498–1515) who owned a vineyard in St.-Joseph known as Clos de Tournon. The first official record of vineyards in St. Joseph occurs in 1668. The appellation is named from a vineyard that was first named for Saint Joseph. This particular vineyard was originally owned by Jesuits and is now owned by the famous winemaker Guigal. 

The modern-day St.-Joseph begins its history around 1916, but did not gain its own AOC until 1956. Before 1969 it was a small appellation covering less than 100 hectares, but in 1971 it was decided to expand the appellation to it present size. In 1994 the potential size of the appellation was capped at 3000 hectares.

Originally it was a wine based on pure Syrah, but since 1979 it has been permitted to include as much as 10% white grapes.

==Climate and geography==
St.-Joseph, along with the rest of Northern Rhône has a continental climate that differs from its southern neighbour, which has a more Mediterranean climate. Winters are wet and marked by the cold &quot;le mistral&quot; winds that can last into the Spring. The appellation is the second largest appellation in the Northern Rhône covering 920 hectares. The classic part of the appellation begins in the south around the villages Mauves and Tournon. This part of St.-Joseph lies fairly high and these fields are regarded as the best of the appellation. 50 km to the north, when the appellation approaches Cote-Rotie, the soil is more rich and the wines differ from the classic southern wines.

==Grapes and wine==
Similar to the Northern Rhône in general, Syrah is the only red grape allowed in St.-Joseph. AOC regulations allow for the addition of up to 10% Marsanne and/or Roussanne, both of which are white varietals. The white wines can be made from any amount of Marsanne and/or Roussanne grapes.

Many of the red wines are meant to be consumed &quot;while waiting for Hermitage and Cote-Rotie to mature.&quot; The best wines are found in the south and the vines in this region can be upwards of 100 years old. Generally the wines are defined by the young fruit that makes them very drinkable while young.

<doc id="993214" wikidata="Q1417744" url="?curid=993214" title="Revenge play">
<text>The [[revenge tragedy]], or revenge play, is a dramatic genre in which the protagonist seeks revenge for an imagined or actual injury. The term &quot;revenge tragedy&quot; was first introduced in 1900 by A. H. Thorndike to label a class of plays written in the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras (circa 1580s to 1620s).

==Origins==

Most scholars argue that the revenge tragedies of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries stemmed from Roman tragedy, in particular, Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Thyestes.&quot; Seneca&#x27;s tragedies followed three main themes: the inconsistency of fortune (&quot;Troades&quot;), stories of crime and the evils of murder (&quot;Thyestes&quot;), and plays in which poverty, chastity and simplicity are celebrated (&quot;Hippolytus&quot;).

In &quot;Thyestes&quot;, Seneca portrayed the evil repercussions of murder. In order to exact revenge on his brother Thyestes for adultery with his wife, Atreus lures him to Argos under the pretext of a shared rule, but instead tricks him into eating the cooked flesh of his own children. Seneca&#x27;s criminals (in this case Thyestes) are always deserving of their punishment unless they repent, since he believed the will to do evil is entirely in the hands of the individual, who must therefore be appropriately punished. This ethical logic becomes complicated, however, since the revenging murder is also a crime, transforming the revenger into a criminal, and thus prompting retribution on behalf of the punished.

While taken from Greek and Roman source material, many early Elizabethan plays with revenge themes had those themes exacerbated by the English translators. That is to say, the original stories were vengeance focused, but when rewritten and staged in England, they had an even greater focus on gruesome revenge.

==Conventions of revenge plays==
*The ghost of the murdered victim urges revenge (&quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Spanish Tragedy&quot;),
*Metatheatricality
*Madness 
*Murder
*Cannibalism

==History and development==

The revenge tragedy was established on the Elizabethan stage with Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; in 1587. In this play, Hieronimo&#x27;s discovery of his son Horatio&#x27;s dead body leads him into a brief fit of madness, after which he discovers the identity of his son&#x27;s murderers and plans his revenge through a play-within-a-play. It is during this play that he enacts his revenge, after which he kills himself. With Hieronimo&#x27;s quest for justice in the face of a seemingly powerless state, &quot;Spanish Tragedy&quot; introduced the thematic issues of retributive justice that would be explored as the genre gained popularity and developed on the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage. The distinction and cultural contention between public and private revenge has been considered by some to be the defining theme of not only early modern revenge tragedy but all early modern tragedy. The tension between public and private revenge, then, has also led to disputes between whether the protagonists enacting private revenge are heroes or villains: is Hieronimo, a character who seeks private revenge to gain retribution for the private murder of his son, a villain or a hero?

Believed to have been staged shortly afterwards, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; is another early piece of the genre in which the dangerous cycle of revenge through private justice is brought to the fore and the typical features of the genre can be found. In this play, Titus&#x27; murder of Tamora&#x27;s eldest son in a ritual of war leads to the rape and mutilation of his daughter Lavinia. As his revenge, Titus murders Tamora&#x27;s remaining sons, bakes them into pie, and serves them to her at a feast.

One of the great contentions of the revenge tragedy is the issue of private revenge vs. divine revenge or public (i.e. state sanctioned) revenge. In his essay, &quot;Of Revenge,&quot; Francis Bacon writes: &quot;the first wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong, putteth the Law out of Office. Certainly, in taking revenge, a man is but even with his Enemy. But in passing it over, he is Superior: For it is a prince&#x27;s part to Pardon.&quot;

As the genre gained popularity, playwrights explored the issue of private vs. public or state justice through the introduction of a variety of revenge characters. In &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, John Marston creates a character named Pandulpho who embodies an idea from the &quot;Spanish Tragedy&quot; of the Senecan stoic. The Senecan stoic is not ruled by emotions but rather follows a balance of cosmic determinism and human freedom to avoid misfortune. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare explores the complexities of the very human desire for revenge in the face of stoic philosophy and ethics. Throughout the play, Hamlet struggles to avenge his father&#x27;s murder (as has been demanded of him by his father&#x27;s ghost), and only does so in the end by mischance.

Other play writers of the period questioned the conventions of the genre through parody reversals of generic expectations. In &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, currently ascribed to Thomas Middleton but formerly thought to be by Cyril Tourneur, the revenge character Vindice is a spiteful man whose pleasure in the act of revenge is what seems to be his true motivation for its fulfillment. &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; by Tourneur followed an anti-revenge plot by having Montferrer&#x27;s ghost explicitly order his son Charlemont not to seek revenge in order to avoid the villainy of violence.

==Reaction==

Scholars have examined the themes of the revenge tragedy in the context of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period as a way to understand its rapid growth in popularity. For some, the fact that plays openly question the morality of revenge and taking justice into one&#x27;s own hands is evidence that the public was morally opposed to the concept. For others, however, the popularity of the genre is evidence that the plays expressed the frustrations and desires for justice against oppressive governance of the public.

==In other media==

Numerous adaptations have been made of revenge plays. Excluding films based on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, these include:
*Julie Taymor&#x27;s &quot;Titus&quot;
*Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot;
*Marcus Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Middleton&#x27;s Changeling&quot;
*Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover&quot; and Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot; are original works in the revenge-play style.
*Todd Field&#x27;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot;
*Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;Oldboy&quot;
For music, Sound Horizon&#x27;s &quot;Märchen&quot; is an original work which has revenge tragedies as its central theme.

For anime series based on manga, &quot;Redo of Healer&quot; is a revenge fantasy about Keyaru, who is exploited and sexually abused repeatedly by others due to being a healing hero, a premise as an example of revenge genre due to its numerous depictions of graphic violence and sexual content, including rape, torture, and cannibalism.

For video games, &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; is a revenge story which depicts numerous violent themes throughout the entire plot.

<doc id="993216" wikidata="Q20035824" url="?curid=993216" title="Revenge tragedy">
<text>Revenge tragedy (sometimes referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) is a theatrical genre, in which the principal theme is revenge and revenge&#x27;s fatal consequences. Formally established by American educator Ashley H. Thorndike in his 1902 article &quot;The Relations of &quot;Hamlet&quot; to Contemporary Revenge Plays,&quot; a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist&#x27;s revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.

The genre first appeared in early modern Britain with the publication of Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; during the latter half of the 16th century. Earlier works, such as Jasper Heywood&#x27;s translations of Seneca (1560s) and Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorbuduc&quot; (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (c.1599-1602) and &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (c.1588-1593), and &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (c.1606) formerly believed to be by Cyril Tourneur, now ascribed to Thomas Middleton.

== Key elements of revenge tragedy ==
As established through the precedent of early English playwrights like Thomas Kyd, a good revenge play must include the following:

* A shocking murder has been committed, crying out for revenge.
* Person, or persons, take up the vengeful mission as a sacred duty.
* Ghost of murdered person provides further stimulus for retribution; alternatively there are omens and presentiments.
* Machiavellian villain who, acting on his own behalf or for other causes facilitates a pandemic of blood shed whilst introducing new fangled tortures and horrors.
* Objects of revenge are often better than the avengers.
* Some characters grow mad or feign madness.
* Play within a play that often mimics the core of the main action.
* Use of imagery and language befitting the violence of the events.

==Revenge tragedy as a genre==
The genre of revenge tragedy developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres. Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a &quot;healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities.&quot; On the contrary, Shakespeare&#x27;s 1623 First Folio famously depicts the printer-imposed (William Jaggard and Edward Blount) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained. While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also city comedy, romance, pastoral, and problem play, among others.

It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and &quot;Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped&quot;. Fredson Bowers&#x27;s work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was originally marketed in the First Folio as &quot;The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; was similarly titled in the First Folio as &quot;The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; and &quot;The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; in the Second Quarto edition (1604). It&#x27;s not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies; however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.

===Lucius Seneca===

Lucius Seneca was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: &quot;Hercules Furens, Troades, Phoenissae, Medea, Phaedra, Oedipus, Agamemnon, Thyestes, Hercules Oetaeus, and Octavia.&quot; The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the cannibalistic feast in &quot;Thyestes&quot; introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre.

Seneca’s &quot;Thyestes&quot;, a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first &quot;revenge pieces&quot;. In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes&#x27;s affair with Atreus&#x27; wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his own children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. In Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton&#x27;s &quot;Gorbudoc&quot; (1562) can be found what is considered by many to be an exact representation of Senecan revenge drama in all aspects.

===Thomas Kyd===

Thomas Kyd provided a refined form of Senecan tragedy through his play &quot;The Spanish Tragedy (1592)&quot;.

===William Shakespeare===
William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot; and even &quot;King Lear&quot; may be referred to as revenge tragedies but it is &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; that truly embraces this genre. It is a play that contains: fourteen killings (nine on stage), six severed members, one rape, one live burial, one case of insanity, one incidence of cannibalism. In short 5.2 atrocities per act or one for every ninety seven lines. &quot;It is a great play, we&#x27;re talking 14 dead bodies, kung-fu sword-fu, arrow-fu, dagger-fu, pie-fu, animal screams on the soundtrack, heads roll, hands roll, tongues roll, nine and half quarts of blood and a record breaking ninety four on the vomit scale.&quot;

After ten long years of a hard-fought war, the Roman general Titus Andronicus returns triumphant; however, with only four out of his twenty five sons alive. One of the captures he has made is Tamora, Queen of the enemy Goths, and her four sons. In accordance with Roman ritual Titus makes a sacrifice of Tamora&#x27;s eldest son to honour his dead sons. Tamora wants revenge and sets out to get it.

She begins her vendetta by seducing and then marrying the emperor whilst scheming with her lover to have two of Titus&#x27; sons framed for the murder of the emperor&#x27;s brother. The plan is successful and the two sons are beheaded. Titus&#x27; remaining son is banished when he tries to intercede on behalf of his sister to allow her to marry the person she loves and not her betrothed. Tamora convinces her two sons to avenge their brother&#x27;s death by raping Titus&#x27; daughter Lavinia. After the rape, they cut off her hands and tongue so she cannot tell anyone about what has happened. With each tragedy, Titus sinks lower and lower and begins to act strangely and is assumed to be crazy from grief. Having feigned madness, Titus tricks Tamora by inviting her and the emperor for dinner. Unbeknownst to them Titus has captured and killed Tamora&#x27;s two sons and has made them into a pie. This he feeds to the two before killing both Tamora and Lavinia. A veritable massacre ensues leaving only a handful of characters live. Having returned from banishment and assuming the mantle of the emperor, Titus&#x27; son has the solo living progeny of Tamora buried alive and Tamora&#x27;s corpse thrown to the wolves.

=== Other examples ===
Elizabethan and Jacobean writers employed as many of these features as their plots allowed and freely made variations in them. Revenge tragedy caught their imagination and writers attempted plays of this genre with their own variations of dramaturgy. Shakespeare raised his revenge tragedy to a high intellectual and philosophical level by making Hamlet a virtuous, sensitive scholar. Cyril Tourneur exploited the morbid and melodramatic in &quot;The Atheists Tragedy &quot;(1611). John Webster reversed the moral position of avengers and victims. In &quot;The White Devil&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; the victims of the so called revenge are heroic women and the avengers blood thirsty villains. In &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (1623) the main characters plot to kill their widowed sister who secretly marries without their consent.

Christopher Crosbie&#x27;s book explores the connection between early modern revenge tragedies and the underlying philosophical influences, aiming to unveil how these plays addressed ontological questions rooted in classical philosophy. He delves into specific works, such as Thomas Kyd’s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, Shakespeare’s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, John Marston&#x27;s &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, and John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, highlighting the philosophical elements woven into the fabric of these dramas. Crosbie&#x27;s in-depth analysis reveals how concepts from Aristotle, Galen, Lucretius, and Stoicism are interwoven into the plays, shedding new light on the philosophical underpinnings of early modern revenge tragedies.

Other examples of revenge tragedies include &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot; (1589, Christopher Marlowe), &quot;Antonio’s Revenge&quot; (1600, John Marston), and &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D’Ambois&quot; (1613, George Chapman).

In his essay &quot;Of Revenge&quot;, Francis Bacon wrote &quot;This is certain, that a man studieth revenge, keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise would heal and do well.&quot;

<text>Traunreut (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Traunreit&quot;) is a town in southeastern Bavaria, Germany in the Traunstein district. It is located at . Traunreut lies in the heart of the Chiemgau region between Munich and Salzburg, approximately 10 km east of the Chiemsee, 25 km north of the Alps, and 35 km west of Salzburg. Its population is approximately 21,000. Companies present in the area include Siteco Beleuchtungstechnik GmbH (lighting fixtures), Dr. Johannes Heidenhain GmbH (linear and rotary encoders, gaging systems, CNC controls), Bosch and Siemens Household Appliances, BSH (household equipment, high-tech stoves and microwaves), and other midsize firms.

==History==
In 1938 an ordnance factory, known as &quot;MUNA St. Georgen&quot;, was built on the outskirts of the village of St. Georgen, at the present location of Traunreut.
After World War II, with the factory closed, ethnic German expellees from their settlements in Central and Eastern Europe settled in the abandoned grounds, and toxic material was removed from the area.

The municipality of Traunreut was founded in 1950. In 1960, Traunreut became a town, and in 1978, after the German local government reform, the then independent neighboring villages of Traunwalchen, Stein - Sankt Georgen and Pierling came under the administration of Traunreut. In 2008 Traunreut is the largest town in the Traunstein district.

<text>The Romanian Naval Forces () is the principal naval branch of the Romanian Armed Forces and operates in the Black Sea and on the Danube. It traces its history back to 1860.

==History==
The Romanian Navy was founded in 1860 as a river flotilla on the Danube. After the unification of Wallachia and Moldavia, Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the ruling Domnitor of the Romanian Principalities, decided on 22 October 1860 by order no. 173 to unify the navies into a single flotilla, the Danube Flotilla Corps. The navy was French-trained and organized. Officers were initially sent to Brest Naval Training Centre in France, as the Military School in Bucharest did not have a naval section. The first Commander-in-chief of the navy was Colonel Nicolae Steriade. The base was first established in 1861 at Izmail, but it was later relocated in 1864 to Brăila and in 1867 to Galați. The equipment was modest at best, with 3 ships from Wallachia and 3 from Moldavia, manned by 275 sailors. The main goal of the navy was to organize, train and expand this small force.
The first seamen&#x27;s training school was established in 1872 at Galați for officers, petty officers and sailors. The first acquisition of the Romanian Navy was the paddle steamboat &quot;&quot;Prințul Nicolae Conache Vogoride&quot;. The ship was purchased in 1861 and was later transformed into a warship at Meyer naval shipyard in Linz, being christened &quot;&quot;&quot; when it was launched at Galați harbor. In 1867, the royal yacht &quot;Ștefan cel Mare&quot; (Stephen the Great) entered service. In October 1873, the &quot;Fulgerul&quot; gunboat, ordered by the Romanian state as the first purpose-built warship in the history of the Romanian Navy, was finished at the Toulon shipyard in France. However, the ship was unarmed, so she would be allowed passage through the Turkish straits. After arriving in Romania in April 1874, she was fitted with a Krupp cannon in a mild steel turret at the Galați shipyard. The next ship to enter service with the Romanian Navy was the spar torpedo boat in 1875. These ships represented the Romanian Flotilla during the War of Independence.

===Romanian Navy during the War of Independence===

During the War of Independence, the name used in Romanian historiography to refer to the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish war, the Romanian Navy sailed under the Russian flag. The main task of the Romanian Flotilla Corps was to transport Russian troops, equipment and supplies across the Danube and to protect the bridges across the river by using mine barrages in key points. The main success of the war was the sinking of the Turkish river monitor &quot;&quot;Seyfî&quot; near Măcin by a group of spar torpedo boats including &quot;Rândunica&quot;&quot; and the Russian &quot;Carevitch&quot; and &quot;Ksenya&quot; crafts. Another notable success was the sinking of the Turkish river monitor &quot;Podgoriçe&quot; (Podgorica) by the Romanian coastal artillery on 7 November 1877.

After the war, the navy transported the Romanian troops back across the Danube. The small but successful navy had demonstrated the need for a strong Danube flotilla in order to secure the southern border of Romania. Three rearmament plans were implemented: during 1883–1885, 1886–1888 and 1906–1908. These plans mainly concentrated on the Danube flotilla. In 1896, the &quot;Flotilla Corps&quot;, as it was known until then, was organized in two sections: the Danube Division and the Sea Division. The riverine base was at Galați, while the maritime base was at Constanța, which was by then part of Romania.

===Creation of the Romanian Black Sea Fleet===
The Romanian Black Sea Fleet was founded in the summer of 1890, 10 years after Romania acquired its first sea-going warship: the gunboat . The newly created division consisted of the small protected cruiser , the training ship , the three &quot;Smeul&quot;-class torpedo boats, and the forementioned &quot;Grivița&quot;.

===Involvement in the Potemkin mutiny===

On 2 July 1905, during the mutiny of the , the Romanian protected cruiser engaged the as the latter was trying to sneak into the Romanian port of Constanța. &quot;Elisabeta&quot; fired two warning shots, first a blank charge then an explosive charge, forcing the torpedo boat to retreat. Later that day, &quot;Potemkin&quot; and &quot;Ismail&quot; left Romanian waters. During the night of 7 July, however, &quot;Potemkin&quot; returned to the Romanian port, this time agreeing to surrender to the Romanian authorities in exchange for the latter giving asylum to the crew. On the noon of 8 July, Captain Negru, the commander of the port, came aboard the &quot;Potemkin&quot; and hoisted the Romanian flag before allowing the warship to enter the inner harbor. On 10 July, after negotiations with the Romanian Government, &quot;Potemkin&quot; was handed over to Imperial Russian authorities and taken to Sevastopol.

===Romanian Navy during World War I===


After the War of Independence, two naval rearmament programs were proposed for the Black Sea flotilla. The 1899 program called for six coastal battleships, four destroyers and twelve torpedo boats. None of these ships were ever built, while the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; was returned 1 day after being acquired. The 1912 naval program envisioned six 3,500-ton light cruisers, twelve 1,500-ton destroyers and a submarine. Four destroyers (and allegedly a submarine) were actually ordered from Italy but were not delivered, as the Italian Navy requisitioned them in 1914. Three 340-ton coastal submarines were ordered from France in early 1917, but these were also requisitioned at the end of the year and completed for the French Navy as the &quot;O&#x27;Byrne&quot; class. The largest Romanian Black Sea ship was the old cruiser , laid down in 1888. The protected cruiser had guarded the mouths of the river Danube during the Second Balkan War, but she was disarmed when World War I began. Her armament was emplaced on the bank of the Danube River to protect against possible attacks by Austro-Hungarian river monitors, and she remained in Sulina for the duration of the war. The Romanian Black Sea squadron also had four old gunboats from the 1880s, which were of limited value, and three old &quot;Năluca&quot;-class torpedo boats, built in France. The Romanian Navy had to rely on the armed merchant ships of the state merchant marine, known as SMR (&quot;Serviciul Maritim Român&quot;). The steam liners &quot;Regele Carol I&quot;, &quot;România&quot;, &quot;Împăratul Traian&quot; and &quot;Dacia&quot; were converted into auxiliary cruisers.

The Danube Flotilla was more modern, and consisted of four river monitors (&quot;Lascăr Catargiu&quot;, , &quot;Ion C. Brătianu&quot; and &quot;Alexandru Lahovari&quot;) and eight British-built torpedo boats. The four river monitors were built in 1907 at Galați. They were armed with three 12-cm cannons each. In 1918, &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu&quot; was converted to a sea-going monitor. The British torpedo boats of the &quot;Căpitan Nicolae Lascăr Bogdan&quot; class were built during 1906–1907 and weighed 50 tons each. There were also approximately six older gunboats used for border patrol and as minelayers, and other auxiliary ships used for transport or supply. The Romanian Navy had a secondary role during World War I and only had light losses. The river monitors participated in the defense of Turtucaia and later secured the flank of the Romanian and Russian defenders in Dobruja. The main success of the war was the mining of an Austro-Hungarian river monitor.

===Romanian Navy during the interwar period===

Following the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Romania took possession of three Austro-Hungarian river monitors (renamed &quot;Ardeal&quot;, &quot;Basarabia&quot; and &quot;Bucovina&quot; after the newly incorporated territories), and in 1921 purchased four Italian patrol boats. These ships, together with the ones already in service, made Romania&#x27;s Danube flotilla the most powerful riverine fleet in the world until World War II.

The main focus of the Romanian Navy during the interwar period was the Black Sea fleet. In 1920, two of the initial four &quot;Aquila&quot;-class scout cruisers (officially designated as destroyers) ordered from Italy were received. These were renamed and . Four gunboats were purchased from the French Navy: &quot;Stihi&quot;, &quot;Dumitrescu&quot;, &quot;Lepri&quot; and . Another gunboat of the same class was bought for spares. Seven torpedo boats were received as war reparations from Austria-Hungary. The torpedo boat &quot;Fulgerul&quot; however was lost during the trip to Romania when she capsized and sank in the Bosphorus in 1922. , and , three of these old torpedo boats, will later see service in World War II. In 1926, two additional destroyers were ordered from Italy: &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; and &quot;Regina Maria&quot; of the Regele Ferdinand class destroyer, together with the Romanian Navy&#x27;s first submarine, , and the submarine tender . These ships were commissioned between 1930 and 1936.

The expansion of the Romanian Navy during the interwar period required more training facilities and ships. The first step towards this issue was taken in 1920, when a naval college was founded at Constanța. In 1938, the sail ship &quot;Mircea&quot; was built in Hamburg by the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard as a training vessel for the Romanian Navy. The SMR (&quot;Serviciul Maritim Român&quot;, the Romanian state merchant marine) was also endowed with a number of new ships: the steamer &quot;Oituz&quot;, the ex-German freighters &quot;Ardeal&quot;, &quot;Peleș&quot;, &quot;Alba Iulia&quot; and &quot;Suceava&quot; (all of them commissioned between 1932 and 1933), the passenger liners &quot;Basarabia&quot; and &quot;Transilvania&quot; (bought from Germany in 1938) and four new freighters from Italy just before the start of the Second World War: &quot;Balcic&quot;, &quot;Cavarna&quot;, &quot;Mangalia&quot; and &quot;Sulina&quot;. In 1940, the SMR had 17 merchant ships with a total of over 72,000 tons of shipping.

===The 1937 naval program and subsequent developments===

In 1937, a new rearmament program was proposed. The new plan envisioned a cruiser, four small destroyers, three submarines, two minelayers and ten motor torpedo boats. These warships were to be built locally at the Galați shipyard, where a new dry dock was developed.

The anti-aircraft escort minelayer was laid down at the Galați shipyard in August 1938, launched in June 1939 and commissioned during the first half of 1941. She replaced the planned cruiser as the largest warship yielded by the 1937 program. She was employed in minelaying operations as well as convoy escort missions. Her main armament consisted of 10.5 cm SK C/32 naval guns, much like the German anti-aircraft cruisers and . Her sister ship, &quot;Cetatea Albă&quot;, was laid down in 1939, but abandoned at an early stage. Her construction was transferred to Germany and in 1940 she was completed by the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg. &quot;Cetatea Albă&quot; had the same standard displacement and top speed as her sister. It is not known, however, if her armament consisted of more than two 102 mm dual-purpose main guns, two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns and 135 mines. &quot;Cetatea Albă&quot; was likely never commissioned.

The four planned destroyers were replaced by four German M-class minesweepers. These were built locally from German materials in 1943. They were 500-ton vessels armed each with two 88 mm main guns, five anti-aircraft guns (two 37 mm and three 20 mm) and two depth-charge throwers.

Two of the three planned submarines were laid down at the Galați shipyard in 1938, launched in May 1941 and commissioned in May 1943. The first one was , a 620-ton attack submarine armed with one 105 mm deck gun, one 37 mm anti-aircraft gun and six 533 mm torpedo tubes (4 bow and 2 stern). Her smaller sister ship, &quot;Rechinul&quot;, was a 585-ton minelaying submarine armed with one 20 mm anti-aircraft gun, four 533 mm torpedo tubes and 40 mines. The third planned submarine was replaced by five Italian CB midget submarines, commissioned in late 1943. The two minelayers were acquired in 1941.

Three of the ten planned motor torpedo boats were built by Vospers in the United Kingdom and acquired in 1940. They were named &quot;Viforul&quot;, and &quot;Vijelia&quot;. Six more MTBs, of the Power type, were built locally as the class. They were laid down in 1939 and commissioned in 1943. The planned number of MTBs was exceeded in August 1943, when seven Italian MAS were also commissioned. These were followed by four 65-ton German S-boats in August 1944, each armed with two 500 mm torpedo tubes.

===World War II and postwar===


In 1941, the Royal Romanian Navy had four destroyers (&quot;Mărășești&quot;, &quot;Mărăști&quot;, &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; and &quot;Regina Maria&quot;), one submarine (&quot;Delfinul&quot;), two minelayers (&quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot; and &quot;Cetatea Albă&quot;, also employed as a destroyer escorts), three auxiliary minelayers, three motor torpedo boats (&quot;Viforul&quot;, &quot;Vijelia&quot;, and ), three gunboats, fifteen small auxiliary vessels and twenty seaplanes.
&quot;Mărăști&quot; had a cracked shaft and could not exceed the speed of 24 knots. As a result, &quot;Mărăști&quot; never ventured far from the coast. &quot;Delfinul&quot;, the only Axis submarine present in the Black Sea in 1941, was obsolete and mechanically unreliable. By comparison, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet had a battleship, three medium cruisers, three light cruisers, three flotilla leaders, eight modern destroyers, five old destroyers, two large torpedo boats, 47 submarines and many other auxiliary and small vessels. The overwhelming superiority of the Soviet Navy forced the Royal Romanian Navy to conduct mainly defensive operations throughout the entire war and its warships rarely hazarded further east than Cape Sarych.

The two &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot;-class destroyers were the most powerful surface units available to the Axis powers during the naval war in the Black Sea but were mostly used for convoy escort. The Romanian-built minelayer/destroyer escort &quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot; and the three auxiliary minelayers of the Romanian Navy played an important role in the defence of Constanța in 1941 and later in securing the merchant convoy routes to the Bosphorus and the supply routes to Odessa and Sevastopol. Mines were the main cause of Soviet submarine losses in the Black Sea naval war. Wartime additions to the fleet included 3 KFK naval trawlers and 3 landing craft of the MFP type.

The Royal Romanian Navy was involved in the evacuation of Axis forces from Crimea in 1944. The Romanian naval commander, Rear Admiral Horia Macellariu, was awarded the German Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross after &quot;Operation 60,000&quot;, the contingency plan for the evacuation of Crimea. Until King Michael&#x27;s Coup, the Romanian Navy retreated behind the protection of the coastal mine barrages and anti-aircraft defences of Constanța as the Soviet Air Force began to launch heavy air attacks. On the capitulation of Romania in August 1944, the German warships were ordered to leave Romanian harbours. However, when the Soviet minesweeper &quot;T-410 Vzryv&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot;, was sunk by a German submarine, the Soviet Navy accused the Royal Romanian Navy of betrayal and seized all vessels using this excuse on 5 September 1944. By this late stage of the war, only one destroyer (&quot;Regina Maria&quot;), one leader (&quot;Mărășești&quot;), two gunboats (&quot;Dumitrescu&quot; and &quot;Ghiculescu&quot;), one minelayer (&quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot;) and three motor torpedo boats were still operational. The rest of the warships were in repairs after the evacuation of Crimea and the Soviet air attacks of the preceding couple of months or had been relegated to training duties. The Soviet Navy moved all Romanian warships to Caucasian ports. They were not returned until after the war. The older vessels were received in September 1945, while the more modern ones (such as the &quot;Regele Ferdinand class&quot;) were kept by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet until the early 1950s. A number of warships were never returned.

The largest Romanian warship loss of the entire war was the accidental sinking of the gunboat &quot;Lepri&quot;. The gunboat ran into a Romanian mine laid by the minelayer &quot;Aurora&quot; near Sulina in January 1941, when hostilities between the Soviet Union and the Axis had not begun. While the Royal Romanian Navy had light losses throughout the war, the state merchant navy was practically non-existent by late 1944: every ship of the &quot;SMR&quot; was sunk or damaged by the Soviet Navy and Air Force because of the light Romanian and German forces in the Black Sea that were unable to provide adequate protection.

The following is a list of battles and operations of the World War II Black Sea Campaign involving the Romanian Navy:
* Raid on Constanța
* Operation München
** Action of 9 July 1941
* Siege of Odessa (1941)
* Crimean Campaign
* Operation Achse
* Crimean Offensive

The Romanian Naval Forces were reorganized during the Soviet occupation of Romania as the Romanian People&#x27;s Navy. Under the Romanian People&#x27;s Navy, the &quot;Nava Majestăţii Sale&quot; (NMS) designation (or “His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship”) that is given to each ship under Romanian Royal Navy was abolished.

====World War II Romanian Black Sea Fleet warships====

==Command, control and organisation==


The Romanian Navy is organized in one Frigate Flotilla and one Riverine Flotilla. Equipment includes two Type 22 frigates, one &quot;Mărășești&quot; class frigate, four corvettes (two Tetal-I and two Tetal-II), three Tarantul-I missile corvettes, three Osa class torpedo boats, one minelayer, four minesweepers, three &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu&quot; class river patrol monitors, five Smârdan-class river monitors and other small craft and auxiliary ships.

As of 2022, ca. 6,800 men and women serve in the Romanian Navy. The main base of the Romanian Navy is located at Constanța. The current chief of the Romanian Navy is Vice Admiral Mihai Panait, appointed on 15 August 2020. The Commander of the Romanian Fleet is Rear Admiral Cornel Cojocaru, and the Commander of the River Flotilla is Real Admiral Nicu Chirea.

The Romanian Naval Forces ordered three IAR 330 Puma Naval helicopters, with the last one being commissioned in December 2008. The helicopters are of a similar configuration to those of the Romanian Air Force, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy Pumas also have flotation gear fitted under the nose and main undercarriage fairings. They are currently operated from Navy frigates for search and rescue, medevac and maritime surveillance missions.

===Naval infantry===
The 307th Marine Infantry Regiment () is the coastal defence unit of the Romanian Navy. The unit was formed in the mid-1970s for the defence of the Danube Delta and Romanian Black Sea shore. It was initially located at 2 Mai village near Mangalia, but since 1975 the Marine Battalion was moved to Babadag, Tulcea County. &quot;The 307th Marine Infantry Regiment is destined to carry out military operations in an amphibious river and lagoon environment, the security of objectives in the coastal area, the Danube Delta and the support of local authorities in case of a civil emergency.&quot; Its base is near the largest military training range in Romania.

The battalion is organized into infantry, reconnaissance, sniper, mortars, anti-tank artillery, engineers, communications, logistic and naval support units. Standard equipment includes PA md. 86 assault rifles, PM md. 64 light machine guns, Md. 66 machine guns, 60/82/120 mm mortars, AG-7 and AG-9 launchers, 76 mm Md. 82 mountain howitzers, 11 ABC-79M and 3 TABC-79M armoured personnel carriers. The 307th Marine Infantry Regiment was involved in military exercises with similar troops from United States, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ukraine that were organized locally or abroad. Also, two companies from this unit have participated in the KFOR mission &quot;Joint Enterprise&quot; in 2008–09.

Since June 1, 2018, the 307th Marine Battalion has been redesignated as 307th Marine Infantry Regiment.

===Future equipment===
The Romanian government plans to acquire new vessels to modernize the Romanian Naval Forces. This plan includes:
*Buying 4 new ships for the navy. Previously these were to be based on the Sigma 10514 design of Damen Group. The frigates were to be built locally (Damen owns two major shipyards in Romania) and the total deal was estimated to be worth 1.6 billion euros (equivalent to U.S. $1.96 billion). However, the decision to go with Damen Group was repealed in 2017.
*, acquiring 3 new submarines, which would also be built locally at a Romanian shipyard. In 2022, Romania signed a letter of intent with France to purchase s.
*In July 2019, Naval Group won a €1.2 billion contract, which includes the construction of four new Gowind multi-mission corvettes for the Romanian Navy, as well as a new maintenance center and a training center. Naval Group was due to build the first corvette within three years, while the remaining three corvettes would have been constructed by Constanța Shipyard and delivered before 2026. However, this deal had not been concluded and was cancelled .

<text>PsycINFO is a database of abstracts of literature in the field of psychology. It is produced by the American Psychological Association and distributed on the association&#x27;s APA PsycNET and through third-party vendors. It is the electronic version of the now-ceased &quot;Psychological Abstracts&quot;. In 2000, it absorbed PsycLIT which had been published on CD-ROM.

PsycINFO contains citations and summaries from the 19th century to the present of journal articles, book chapters, books, and dissertations.

== Overview ==
The database, which is updated weekly, contained over 3.5 million records as of October 2013. Approximately 175,000 records were added to the database in 2012.

== Coverage ==
More than 2,540 peer-reviewed journal titles are included in the database, and they make up 78% of the overall content. Journals are included if they are archival, scholarly, peer-reviewed, and regularly published with titles, abstracts, and keywords in English. As of October 2013, over 1,700 journal titles were included in their entirety (i.e. &quot;cover to cover&quot;). Articles were selected for psychological relevance from the remaining titles.

Chapters from authored and edited books make up 11% of database, while entire authored and edited books make up 4% of the database. Books are selected if they are scholarly, professional, or research-based, English-language, published worldwide, and relevant to psychology.

Dissertations are selected from Dissertation Abstracts International (A and B), and make up 10% of database. They are selected on basis of classification in DAI in sections with psychological relevance. The database contains abstracts in dissertation records starting from 1995.

Publications from at least 50 countries are included, with journals in more than 27 languages, and non-English titles in Roman alphabets from 1978 to the present.

== Record contents ==
Each record contains a bibliographic citation, abstract, index terms from the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms, keywords, classification categories, population information, the geographical location of the research population, and cited references for journal articles, book chapters, and books, mainly from 2001 to present. Records of books include the book&#x27;s table of contents.

Abstracts range from 1995 to present, and virtually 100% of records have abstracts (0.007% no abstracts). For non-dissertation documents added from 1967 to present, 99.2% contain abstracts.

The 11th Edition (print) of Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms was released in July 2007, containing 200 new terms. There are more than 8,400 controlled terms and cross-references, with hierarchical, alphabetical, and subject arrangements. Records are indexed with the most specific term applicable, and major and minor terms assigned, with a maximum of 15 total terms, 5 major terms. The Thesaurus, no longer available in print format, is included with all PsycINFO licenses and is updated regularly.

The classification system consists of 22 major categories and 135 subcategories, and a list of codes. Each record is assigned to one or two classifications.

There were more than 57 million cited references in approximately 1.4 million entries for journal articles, books, and book chapters as of October 2013, all in APA-style format.

<text>Ray is a 2004 American biographical musical drama film focusing on 30 years in the life of soul musician Ray Charles. The independently produced film was co-produced and directed by Taylor Hackford; it was written by James L. White from a story by Hackford and White. It stars Jamie Foxx as Charles, along with Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, Harry Lennix, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Richard Schiff, and Regina King in supporting roles. Along with Hackford, the film was also produced by Stuart Benjamin, Howard Baldwin, and Karen Baldwin.

It was released on October 29, 2004, by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Foxx&#x27;s performance and became a box office success, grossed $124 million worldwide on a budget of $25 million.

&quot;Ray&quot; received many accolades and nominations and was nominated in six categories at the 77th Academy Awards, including for Best Picture. It won two Academy Awards: Best Actor for Foxx and Best Sound Mixing. Foxx also won Best Actor at the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics&#x27; Choice becoming the second actor to win all five major lead actor awards for the same performance, and the only one to win the Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy category, rather than in Drama.

Charles had planned to attend a screening of the completed film but died of liver disease in June 2004, four months prior to the premiere.
==Plot==

Ray Charles Robinson is raised in poverty in Florida by his mother, Aretha. Learning to play piano at an early age, Ray is haunted by the accidental death of his younger brother George, who drowns in their mother&#x27;s washbasin. Ray loses his vision by age seven and becomes completely blind. Aretha teaches him to be independent, eventually sending him to a school for the deaf and blind.

In 1946, Ray joins a white country band and wears sunglasses to hide his damaged eyes. Two years later, he travels to Seattle and joins a nightclub band, though the club&#x27;s owner demands sexual favors and controls his money and career. After discovering he is being exploited, Ray signs his own record deal and leaves the band. Touring on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit as &quot;Ray Charles&quot;, he is introduced to heroin.

Ray is discovered by Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records and records his first hit with Ertegun&#x27;s Yamilksa song &quot;Mess Around&quot;. In Houston, Ray falls in love with Della Bea, a preacher&#x27;s daughter. Though she and others are unhappy about Ray mixing gospel with his music, he marries Della and continues to gain fame with &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;.

A pregnant Della finds Ray&#x27;s drug kit and confronts him. They reconcile after the birth of their first child, but Ray begins an affair with singer Mary Anne Fisher. In 1956, as Ray&#x27;s popularity grows, he hires a trio to become &quot;The Raelettes&quot; and immediately falls for lead singer Margie Hendrix. They begin their own affair, and a jealous Mary Anne leaves.

Margie asks Ray to let her try heroin, but he orders her to stay away from it. His producers recognize his now-complete addiction as he presents symptoms while recording &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot; on a new electric piano, but despite their concern they recognize his genius and his recording career continues.

A few years later, when Ray&#x27;s band finishes a set early and the club&#x27;s owner demands they play the remaining time, Ray performs &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; on the spot. His popularity rises through the 1950s and he moves his family to Los Angeles but continues to use heroin, straining his relationships with Della and Margie. In 1960, he signs a better contract with ABC Records, negotiating to own his master tapes.

Ray continues to develop his music, recording such hits as &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;. Margie reveals she is pregnant, and cuts off their affair when Ray demands she end the pregnancy. He writes &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; with a solo by Margie, who uses her newfound recognition to embark on a solo career, while Ray struggles with his addiction.

In 1961, Ray encounters civil rights protestors outside his concert in Augusta, Georgia. Deciding not to play at the segregated venue, he cancels the concert and is banned from playing in Georgia. After he allows black and white audience members to dance together onstage during a concert in Indianapolis, his hotel room is raided by police. His arrest for heroin possession is made public, to Della&#x27;s dismay, but his record label has the charges dismissed.

In St. Louis, Ray performs the country-influenced &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; and is impressed by announcer Joe Adams, who joins his tour. Ray moves his family to Beverly Hills, and learns that Margie has died of an overdose. Joe alienates Ray&#x27;s band and his longtime friend and manager Jeff Brown, whom Ray fires, for stealing.

In 1965, Ray returns from a concert in Montreal and is again arrested for heroin possession. Dismissing his excuses, Della pleads with him to overcome his habit, and he is sentenced to drug rehabilitation. Suffering vivid nightmares during withdrawal, Ray learns to play chess with Dr. Hacker and Hacker explains to him that his lawyer&#x27;s arguments with the judge agreed to probation in Boston under the condition that he completes his drug rehab program and agrees to take periodic drug tests. Ray has a vision of George and their mother, who, while praising the fact he became a success, chastises him for letting his addictions cripple him, with George telling Ray that his death was not his fault.

By 1979, Ray has permanently quit heroin and receives an official apology from the state of Georgia, which names &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; the official state song. Ray goes on to have a long and successful career as a world-famous entertainer until his death in 2004.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s production was entirely financed by Philip Anschutz, through his Bristol Bay Productions company. Taylor Hackford said that it took 15 years to make the film; or more specifically, as he later clarified in the liner notes of the soundtrack album, this is how long it took him to secure the financing. It was made on a budget of $40 million.

Charles was given a Braille copy of the film&#x27;s original script; he objected only to a scene showing him taking up piano grudgingly, and a scene implying that Charles had shown mistress and lead &quot;Raelette&quot; Margie Hendricks how to shoot heroin.

Hackford originally had the idea of using a stunt double to make it look like Foxx was playing the piano but was shocked to find out that he went to college on a classical piano scholarship. Foxx does not sing as Charles with exception to cover versions Charles performs in his earlier years. Kanye West and Ludacris have since made songs with Foxx singing as Charles in their songs &quot;Gold Digger&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot;, respectively. Instead of studying Ray Charles in person, Foxx watched old video footage of him to authentically recreate the vibe of Ray Charles when he was a lot younger. Foxx also shot the majority of the film blind as he used prosthetics to cover his eyes.

Hackford stated that while Anschutz agreed to finance the film, he demanded that it be PG-13, which caused Hackford to walk away from the film twice. Because Charles and Ahmet Ertegun asked him to make the movie, he agreed to do the film as a PG-13 rating. The film was rated PG-13 for &quot;depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements&quot;.

Hackford stated that no studio was interested in backing the movie. After it was shot independently, Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute it. Part of the reason Universal Pictures released it was because one of its executives used to hitchhike to Ray Charles concerts.

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Craig Armstrong. &quot;Ray&quot; debuted at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Ray&quot; was released in theaters on October 29, 2004. The film went on to become a box-office hit, earning $75 million in the U.S. with an additional $50 million internationally, bringing its worldwide gross to $125 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An engrossing and energetic portrait of a great musician&#x27;s achievements and foibles, &quot;Ray&quot; is anchored by Jamie Foxx&#x27;s stunning performance as Ray Charles.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The movie would be worth seeing simply for the sound of the music and the sight of Jamie Foxx performing it. That it looks deeper and gives us a sense of the man himself is what makes it special.&quot; Ebert gave it a full 4 out of 4 stars. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; praised the cast, saying &quot;If there were an Oscar for ensemble acting, Ray would win in a stroll.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Jamie Foxx gets so far inside the man and his music that he and Ray Charles seem to breathe as one.&quot;

According to music critic Robert Christgau, &quot;Foxx does the impossible—radiates something approaching the charisma of the artist he&#x27;s portraying... that&#x27;s the only time an actor has ever brought a pop icon fully to life on-screen.&quot;
===Related projects===
In the wake of his performance as Charles in the film, Foxx featured on hip-hop songs that sampled Charles&#x27; songs:
* &quot;Georgia&quot; by Ludacris also featuring Field Mob, which samples &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;.
* &quot;Gold Digger&quot; by Kanye West, which samples &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;.

==Historical accuracy ==
The film&#x27;s credits state that &quot;Ray&quot; is based on true events, but includes some characters, names, locations, and events which have been changed and others which have been &quot;fictionalized for dramatization purposes.&quot; Examples of the fictionalized scenes include:
* The film&#x27;s portrayal of Charles&#x27; brother George&#x27;s death in 1935 shows him drowning in a metal tub after Ray does not attempt to rescue him because he assumes he is just playing; Ray&#x27;s mother then discovers George drowning when calling the boys in for dinner. Though George did drown in a metal tub, Ray did try to pull him out, but was unable to do so due to George&#x27;s large body weight; Ray then ran inside to tell his mother what happened.
* Throughout the film, it is suggested that Ray&#x27;s depression and heroin addiction were fueled by nervous breakdowns he had over the deaths of both George and his mother, as well as his blindness. In reality, the death of his mother did give him a nervous breakdown and was thought to be a leading cause of his depression, but the death of George and his blindness did not lead to nervous breakdowns.
* It is true that Charles kicked his heroin addiction after undergoing treatment in a psychiatric hospital during 1965, as stated towards the end of the film, but it is not mentioned that he would often use gin and marijuana as substitutes for heroin throughout much of the remaining years of his life.
* In the scene in which &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; is being played, Charles is depicted as playing a Fender Rhodes electric piano, but in reality, he used a Wurlitzer electric piano on the original recording and began using it on tour in 1956, because he did not trust the tuning and quality of the pianos provided to him at every venue.
* In the film, when his backing singer and mistress Margie Hendricks informs Ray she is pregnant with his child, Ray suggests she should have an abortion, out of loyalty to Della; Margie decides to keep the baby and soon leaves Ray to pursue a separate singing career after he refuses to abandon his family, move in with her and welcome the baby into his life. In reality, Hendricks did conceive a child with Charles and abandoned him after he refused to leave Della, but Charles never asked her to have an abortion, and welcomed any child he conceived, whether from Della or any mistress, into his personal life.
*In the film Margie leaves the Raelettes in 1961, but in reality she was fired from the group by Ray in 1964 after a heated argument.
* In the scene in which Charles is about to enter a segregated music hall in Augusta, Georgia, in 1961, a group of civil rights activists protesting just outside the hall successfully persuade him not to perform; Charles then declares that he will no longer perform in segregated public facilities and in response, the Georgia state legislature passes a resolution banning Charles from ever performing again in the state. In reality, a group of civil rights activists did successfully persuade Charles to reject this invitation, but the advice came in the form of a telegram rather than a street protest; Charles also did make up for the gig later, and was never banned from performing in Georgia and still accepted invitations to perform at segregated public facilities.
* In the film, Margie Hendricks dies in 1964, and it was stated the death was caused by drug overdose. However, in reality she died on July 14, 1973, but no official cause of death was determined because an autopsy was not performed.
* During the final scene in the film, when Charles&#x27; version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; becomes Georgia&#x27;s state song, Charles is congratulated by his wife Della, and a resolution is also passed to lift the lifetime ban he had received in 1961 after he declared he would no longer perform at segregated public facilities. In reality, by the time &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; became Georgia&#x27;s state song in 1979, Charles and Della had already divorced, so she was not present when Charles performed at the Georgia State Legislature; and since he had never been banned from performing in Georgia in the first place, no such resolution was ever passed.

<text>Annalen der Physik (English: &quot;Annals of Physics&quot;) is one of the oldest scientific journals on physics; it has been published since 1799. The journal publishes original, peer-reviewed papers on experimental, theoretical, applied, and mathematical physics and related areas. The editor-in-chief is Stefan Hildebrandt. Prior to 2008, its ISO 4 abbreviation was &quot;Ann. Phys. (Leipzig)&quot;, after 2008 it became &quot;Ann. Phys. (Berl.)&quot;.

The journal is the successor to , published from 1790 until 1794, and &#x27;, published from 1795 until 1797. The journal has been published under a variety of names (&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;, &quot;Wiedemann&#x27;s Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot;) during its history.

==History==
Originally, was published in German, then a leading scientific language. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the journal published in both German and English. Initially, only foreign authors contributed articles in English but from the 1970s German-speaking authors increasingly wrote in English in order to reach an international audience. After the German reunification in 1990, English became the only language of the journal.

The importance of unquestionably peaked in 1905 with Albert Einstein&#x27;s Annus Mirabilis papers. In the 1920s, the journal lost ground to the concurrent &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;. With the 1933 emigration wave, German-language journals lost many of their best authors. During Nazi Germany, it was considered to represent &quot;the more conservative elements within the German physics community&quot;, alongside &quot;Physikalische Zeitschrift&quot;. Between 1944 and 1946 publication ceased due to World War II. Granted permission to restart by Soviet military authorities in August 1946, the journal subsequently maintained a policy until 1992 of co-editorship by one person from East Germany and one from West Germany. After German reunification, the journal was acquired by Wiley-VCH.

A relaunch of the journal with new editor and new contents was announced for 2012. As a result of the 2012 relaunch, changed scope and updated the membership of the editorial board.

===Editors===
The early editors-in-chief were:
* Friedrich Albrecht Carl Gren (1790–1797) (as and )
* Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert (1799–1824) (as and )
* Johann Christian Poggendorff (1824–1876) (as )
* Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann (1877–1899) (as )
* Paul Karl Ludwig Drude (1900–1906) (as )
With each editor, the numbering of volumes restarted from 1 (co-existent with a continuous numbering, a perpetual source of confusion). The journal was often referred to by the editor&#x27;s name: &quot;Gilberts Annalen&quot;, &quot;Poggendorfs Annalen&quot;, &quot;Wiedemanns Annalen&quot; and so on, or for short &quot;Pogg. Ann.&quot;, &quot;Wied. Ann.&quot;

After Drude, the work was divided between two editors: experimentalists Wilhelm Wien (1907–1928) and Eduard Grüneisen (1929–1949) and theoretician Max Planck (1907–1943, who had been associate editor from 1895).

In these times, peer-review was not yet standard. Einstein, for example, just sent his manuscripts to Planck, who then published them.

===Notable published works===
Some of the most famous papers published in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; were:
* on solving for the currents in an electronic circuit by Gustav Kirchhoff (1847),
* on stretched exponential relaxation by Rudolf Kohlrausch (1854), 
* on stretched exponential relaxation by Friedrich Kohlrausch (1863,1876),
* on the photoelectric effect by Heinrich Hertz (1887),
* on the theory of blackbody radiation by Max Planck (1901),
* on capillarity by Albert Einstein (1901),
* the Annus Mirabilis papers by Albert Einstein on photons, on Brownian motion, on mass–energy equivalence, and on the special theory of relativity, (1905)
* on the heat capacities of solids with quantized energy levels by Einstein (1907),
* on molecular motion near absolute zero by Einstein and Otto Stern (1913),
* on the general theory of relativity by Einstein (1916)

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in:

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 3.443, ranking it 11th out of 79 journals in the category &quot;Physics Multidisciplinary&quot;.

<doc id="993234" wikidata="Q2796839" url="?curid=993234" title="Collins Street, Melbourne">
<text>Collins Street is a major street in the central business district of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was laid out in the first survey of Melbourne, the original 1837 Hoddle Grid, and soon became the most desired address in the city. Collins Street was named after Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania David Collins who led a group of settlers in establishing a short-lived settlement at Sorrento in 1803.

The eastern end of Collins Street has been known colloquially as the &#x27;Paris End&#x27; since the 1950s due to its numerous heritage buildings, old street trees, high-end shopping boutiques, and as the location for the first footpath cafes in the city. As with all main streets in the Melbourne city centre, the Hoddle Grid is exactly 99 feet wide which would allow for the installation of trams in 1885. Blocks further west centred around Queen Street became the financial heart of Melbourne in the 19th century, the preferred home of major banks and insurance companies, a tradition which continues today with the most prestigious office blocks and skyscrapers found along its length.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
As laid out by the surveyor Robert Hoddle, it was exactly one mile in length and one and half chains () wide. The street was named for Lieutenant-Governor David Collins who led a group of settlers in establishing a short-lived settlement at Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne, in the early 19th century. He subsequently became the first governor of the colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, later to become the state of Tasmania. At the western end of the street was Batman&#x27;s Hill, named for the Tasmanian adventurer and grazier John Batman, who built a house at the base in April 1836, where he lived until his death in 1839.

The first major street improvements were carried out in the mid-1850s, including bluestone curbs and gutters, and the introduction of gas lighting in 1855. The first street trees were elms, planted in 1875. A cable tram line was laid in 1886 and was operational until 1930 when it was electrified.

Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the top end of Collins Street, known as Collins Street East, was dominated by the rooms of medical professionals. The prestigious Melbourne Club was a dominant cultural presence after its founding in 1838. Collins Street was also the location of Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street) which was Australia&#x27;s first custom designed studio complex, and was used by many prominent Australian artists. With the development of the suburbs, doctors relocated from their residences, set back from the street by substantial gardens along Collins Street East (now known as the &#x27;Paris End&#x27;), and shopfronts were built in place, including then department store Georges.

=== 20th century ===

Around the turn of the 20th century &quot;doing the Block,&quot; or walking around in one&#x27;s finest clothing to be seen, became a pastime for shoppers at the Block Arcade in the retail heart of Collins Street, between Elizabeth and Swanston Streets.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the street became subject to extensive redevelopment and many historic buildings were demolished by Whelan the Wrecker, despite the efforts of the National Trust and the Save Collins Street group. While some examples of Boom Style architecture survive, the grandest examples were lost to the wrecker&#x27;s ball. Of the major losses, the most significant were the large Victorian buildings including the Federal Coffee Palace, Colonial Mutual Life building, Robb&#x27;s buildings, Queen Victoria Buildings, City of Melbourne Bank, Scott&#x27;s Hotel, Melbourne Mansions and APA building. Many of the buildings destroyed in this era were documented by architectural photographer Mark Strizic and can be found in the archives of the State Library of Victoria.

One of the most popular public art statues in Melbourne, Larry La Trobe created by artist Pamela Irving, faces Collins Street from the northern end of Melbourne City Square.

=== 21st century ===
Between 2003 and 2005, Collins Street was extended west beyond its previous termination at Spencer Street, starting with the opening of the bridge over Southern Cross station and Wurundjeri Way on 18 December 2002, with the street ending outside the new ANZ and Myer headquarters further in the Docklands development. It has since been extended further west to create an intersection between Bourke Street and Collins Streets, two of Melbourne&#x27;s most important streets.

==Architecture==
As Melbourne&#x27;s commercial and former shopping centre, Collins Street possesses some of Melbourne&#x27;s best examples of Victorian architecture. Large churches include the Collins Street Baptist Church (1845), the St Michael&#x27;s Uniting Church (1866) and the Scot&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (1874).

Significant commercial buildings include Alston&#x27;s Corner (1914) by Nahum Barnet, an excellent surviving example of Edwardian architecture, while the Block Arcade by D.C Askew (1891-3) is an excellent example of high Victorian Mannerist architecture. To the west in the financial end are some great examples of high Victorian Gothic architecture including William Pitt&#x27;s elaborate Stock Exchange (1888), next to William Wardell&#x27;s Venetian influenced Gothic Bank (1883) on the north east corner of Queen Street, which features some of Melbourne&#x27;s finest Gothic interiors, and diagonally opposite the former National Mutual designed by Wright, Reed &amp; Beaver (1891).

The old Commercial Bank of Australia Limited domed Chamber exists within the postmodern 333 Collins Street tower. It was designed by Lloyd Tayler and Alfred Dunn and built in 1891. Some of Australia&#x27;s tallest buildings are along Collins Street, including the Rialto Towers, Collins Place towers 1 &amp; 2, Nauru House, 120 Collins Street and 101 Collins Street and the former ANZ World Headquarters, at 380 Collins Street, behind the old Stock Exchange and Gothic Bank.

The 1929 built Francis House at 107 Collins Street, was the first building awarded the Street Architecture Medal and was designed by architects Blackett and Forster for pharmacists Henry Francis &amp; Co. It still stands in near original condition, a handsome but narrow fronted five storey commercial building with a fine grained street level shopfront currently leased by Bally.

The Bank of New South Wales Melbourne building, completed in 1857, earned architect Joseph Reed a first prize in architecture. When the building was demolished in 1935, the facade was transplanted to the University of Melbourne in Parkville to become the Commerce Building.

<text>Sam Gross (August 7, 1933 – May 6, 2023) was an American cartoonist, specializing in single-panel cartoons. He contributed to an array of publications, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==History==
Born in The Bronx, New York City, Gross was the son of Max and Sophie, who were Jewish immigrants to America. His mother was born in Iași, Romania and his father was born in Lithuania. His parents came to the United States as children around 1905. Gross said his mother&#x27;s side of the family is artistic. His father was a CPA.

Gross attended DeWitt Clinton High School, which at the time was an all-boys school. After he graduated, Gross went to City College. He started as a business major, then he wanted to be an accounting major, and finally an advertising major. Gross ended up taking a lot of art and history courses.

Sam Gross began cartooning in 1962 and has continued ever since. His cartoons have appeared in numerous magazines, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Gross was cartoon editor for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and &quot;Parents Magazine&quot;. Gross also became involved in electronic publishing ventures with cartoons playing an important role.

Gross died on May 6, 2023, at the age of 89.

==Work habits==
Every Wednesday Gross sat down to draw and, what he called, &quot;trip&quot;. He claimed that he did not draw for magazines or newspapers, he just drew. Gross averaged 16–17 drawings a week, and numbered and dated every one. Once finished, he photocopied the drawings on forty-four-pound stock paper, then punched three holes and put them into loose-leaf books; Gross was afraid of losing his original copy and idea. In 2012, Sam Gross had a total of about 27,592 cartoons.

==Comic strips==
Gross created the comic strip &quot;Cigarman&quot;.

==Collections==
Published collections of cartoons by Sam Gross include:
*&quot;How Gross! : The Collected Craziness of S. Gross&quot; (1973)

<doc id="993255" wikidata="Q429181" url="?curid=993255" title="A1 motorway (Romania)">
<text>The A1 motorway () is a partially built motorway in Romania, planned to connect Bucharest with the Banat and Crișana regions in the western part of the country and the rest of Europe. When completed it will be 581 kilometers long and it will span the country on the approximative south-east to north west direction. The motorway starts in the western part of Bucharest and connects the following major cities: Pitești, Sibiu, Deva, Timișoara, Arad, reaching Hungary&#x27;s M43 motorway near Nădlac. As the motorway is built along the Trans-European Transport Networks Rhine-Danube Corridor the construction receives 85% funding from the European Union. The road is part of the proposed Via Carpatia route.

As of December 2022, the combined length of the opened sections totals 458.1 kilometers. Other 54.5 kilometers have been tendered. The parts of the motorway currently in service include the Bucharest – Pitești section (109.5 km), the Boița – Holdea section (188 km), and the Margina – Nădlac section (158.8 km).

An additional segment, between Coșevița – Margina (13.5 km), which has several tunnels (2.1 km, in total) along its route, has been re-tendered in June 2019, because the project had been modified.

On the Pitești – Sibiu section, two segments were tendered as well: Pitești − Curtea de Argeș (30.4 km, lot 5) and Curtea de Argeș − Tigveni (10.7 km, lot 4), with the latter one awarded for construction in April 2019, and the first segment (Pitești − Curtea de Argeș) in May 2020.

In December 2024, the 16-km segment from Pitești to Curtea de Argeș (lot 5) was opened 8 months in advance. 

==Sections==

===Bucharest – Pitești===
This section of the motorway is fully operational and is composed of two segments: Bucharest – Pitești and Pitești bypass.

The Bucharest – Pitești segment (95.9 km) is the first motorway class road built in Romania and remained the only one for more than 15 years, until the completion of the Fetești – Cernavodă segment on the A2 motorway in 1987. Construction works began on 4 February 1967 and the motorway&#x27;s initial carriageway was opened on 12 April 1972, before eventually entering in full service to all traffic on 11 September 1972, except for oversize loads that were otherwise restricted to the old DN7 road. Various parts of the segment underwent several major rehabilitations: between 1997 and 2000 by the FAT joint venture composed of Italian companies Federici, Astaldi and Todini, between 2002 and 2004 by the Romanian companies Albix Timișoara and Cosar București and between 2006 and 2010 by Romanian companies PA&amp;CO Internațional and Euroconstruct Trading &#x27;98. As of August 2023 this is the only segment of the motorway where motels and restaurants operate in rest areas.

The Pitești bypass segment (13.6 km) was awarded in April 2004 to a joint venture composed of Italian companies Astaldi and Italstrade. The segment was opened to traffic during November 2007, having a major role in diverting traffic from the Pitești city centre. An underpass in the Bascov area (north of Pitești) was also built to resolve traffic congestion at the nearby junction of the DN7 and DN7C roads which was generating in turn problems at the Pitești motorway end. The underpass was fully completed during October 2008.

===Pitești – Sibiu===
This section of the motorway is partially under construction and is split into five segments: Pitești – Curtea de Argeș (lot 5), Curtea de Argeș – Văleni (lot 4), Văleni – Racovița (lot 3), Racovița – Boița (lot 2), Boița – Sibiu (lot 1).

This is the most difficult section of the whole motorway from construction works perspective, considering that it has to cross the Carpathian Mountains, partly along the Olt River Valley. The feasibility study was initially completed during late 2008 with plans to start construction works next year, however the Romanian Government has continuously delayed the start of the activity until 2012, considering several options on how the motorway construction was to be funded, while advancing several deadlines for the start/completion of works on the section. As during early 2012 the section was accepted to be funded under European Union&#x27;s Cohesion Fund, the 2008 feasibility study had to be updated with several key elements required by the European Union that were previously not considered. The tender for the update was launched in April 2012 aiming to have the section finalized by 2020, as total construction costs for its 116.6 kilometers were estimated at 3.25 billion euro. Eight months later the Romanian Government reconsidered and cancelled the tender.

The year 2013 brought much controversy, as the Romanian Government declared that the priority motorway route for crossing the Carpathian Mountains will be the A3 motorway (between Comarnic and Brașov) instead of the A1 motorway (between Pitești and Sibiu) and further supported the idea of modifying the route of the Pan-European Corridor IV to pass through Brașov. According to the same plans the A3 motorway was to be connected to the A1 motorway via another motorway between Sibiu and Făgăraș, thus creating a nearly complete motorway corridor between Bucharest and Sibiu, via Brașov, while the section between Pitești and Sibiu was no longer an immediate priority. This was generally regarded as a strategy to avoid a competing alternative route to the section of the A3 motorway between Comarnic and Brașov, which was planned to be built via a concession contract. During the 2013 Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) reunion the European Union rejected the plan and officially criticized the attempt to switch priorities from constructing the Pitești – Sibiu motorway, determining the Romanian authorities to reconsider the change.

After further trying unsuccessfully in December 2013 to persuade the European Union to change the route of the motorway to pass through Râmnicu Vâlcea, the Romanian Government has retendered in June 2014 the update of the 2008 feasibility study for the section, and has signed the contract for this activity with a joint venture composed of the Italian company Spea Ingegneria Europea and the Romanian company Tecnic Consulting Engineering in June 2015, after an appeal from one of the bid participants. As the Ministry of Transport has started work on the Romanian General Master Plan for Transport required to access 2014–2020 European funds, it generated further controversy by appearing to continue to try avoiding the construction of the section as a motorway, as it downgraded it to express road in an October 2014 version of the Master Plan and later considered a phased express road/motorway approach in a subsequent version of the Master Plan. This has prompted reactions from the European Union, the public society and the employees of the Dacia plant near Pitești, and while the Romanian Prime Minister announced during October 2014 that the section will be included as a motorway in the final version of the Master Plan the change was reflected in the document only in July 2015.

In an interview given by the general manager of CNADNR during August 2015 it was announced that possible routes for lots 1 and 5 were already discussed with the joint venture updating the feasibility study and based on that the company will hold public consultations during October 2015, where all interested parties will be invited to comment on the proposed solutions and also to contribute with knowledge regarding the potential problems CNADNR might face on the selected routes. Dependent on the issues that might be identified and their environmental impact, the bid for the construction works on these two lots might be launched as early as January 2016. CNADNR has published on 7 November 2015 five alternative routes for the Pitești – Sibiu section. As previously announced all interested parties are welcome to provide their opinion by 11 December 2015 on the company&#x27;s Facebook page. Following these consultations, it is expected that on 15 December 2015 the company preparing the feasibility study will hand over to CNADNR the final study for lots 1 and 5.

According to the approved version of the Master Plan, the section was expected to be completed until 2020 using a mix between European funds, Romanian budget and low interest loans.

The works for lots 1 and 5 were tendered in July 2017 and for lot 4 in March 2019. As of April 2019, the lot 1 was awarded for construction to the Austrian company Porr, for nearly 128.7 million euro, with 12 months allowed for planning and 36 months for execution. The other two lots were still pending to be awarded.

Announcements of intention for a tender were published for two of the rest of the three lots, as well, in April 2018.

As of July 2019, the lot 1 of this section (Boița – Sibiu, 13.1 km) is undergoing construction.

On 11 May 2020, the contract for the construction of the lot 5 (Pitești – Curtea de Argeș, 30.4 km) was signed with the Italian company Astaldi. The value of the contract is 356 million euro and it is scheduled to take 12 months for planning and 48 months for execution. The lot 4 (Curtea de Argeș – Tigveni, 9.86 km) followed on 15 November 2021; the contract for its construction was signed with the Austrian company Porr. On 7 February 2022, the contract for the construction of the lot 2 (Boița – Cornetu, 31.3 km) was signed with the Turkish joint-venture Mapa-Cengiz.
On 1 August 2022, the contract for the construction of the lot 3 (Cornetu–Tigveni, 37.3 km) was signed with Webuild. It is the most expensive roadbuilding contract ever signed in Romania. On 15 December 2022, lot 1 (Sibiu - Boița, 13.1 km) was opened to the public 

===Sibiu bypass===
This section of the motorway is fully operational.

The contract for the whole section (17.5 km) forming a partial beltway around Sibiu was initially signed during 2003 with Italian company Todini, with the actual construction work starting during 2004 and scheduled to finish during 2007. This plan suffered multiple delays and eventually in September 2006 CNADNR decided to terminate the contract. Following this, the section was split into two segments. The first segment (km 0-14) was awarded in May 2008 to a joint venture composed of Geiger, Max Bögl and Comtram. The second segment (km 14-17) was awarded in September 2009 to the Romanian company Vectra Service and included also the upgrade of 3.3 kilometers of road connecting the motorway with DN1 that was designated DN1T. Works started on the first segment during July 2008 and on the second during February 2010 and were scheduled to be fully completed during 2011, but as a result of the authorities insisting on the bypass being finished sooner the section was opened for traffic in December 2010.

===Sibiu – Orăștie===
This section of the motorway is fully open and is split into four segments: Sibiu – Săliște (lot 4), Săliște – Cunța (lot 3), Cunța – Sebeș (lot 2) and Sebeș – Orăștie (lot 1).

The bid for the design &amp; build contracts for all four segments that are part of this section was launched by CNADNR during December 2010. The Cunța – Săliște segment (22.1 km), which includes the long Aciliu viaduct was awarded to Italian company Impregilo in May 2011, while the Orăștie – Sebeș segment (24.1 km) was awarded to Austrian company Strabag, the Sebeș – Cunța segment (19.7 km) was awarded to a joint venture composed of Romanian companies Straco and Studio Corona and the Săliște – Sibiu segment (16.1 km) was awarded to Italian company Astaldi, all in June 2011. Construction works on all four segments have started in October 2011 and were planned to finish in April 2013. After several delays, lots 1, 2 and 4 were opened in December 2013, while lot 3 was eventually opened at the end of November 2014. As of November 2015 construction works were still ongoing on lot 3, as there are multiple issues on this lot generated by a combination of ignoring the terrain instability identified by the feasibility study, the low quality of the construction works and the Romanian Government pressuring for electoral reasons for the segment to open before a number of critical road elements were completed. Another aspect that has surfaced and is generating controversy is related to the fact that while there are multiple disputes awaiting resolution between CNADNR and Impregilo and during the construction of the segment there were around 300 non-conformity reports issued, CNADNR has paid to Impregilo the works executed. Following this, during August 2015 the general manager of CNADNR has given a number of interviews during various TV shows defending the company and putting all the blame for the issues on lot 3 on the poor quality of execution of Impregilo.

Regardless of the statements from both parties, the problems on lot 3 are serious enough so that they required CNADNR to close down the traffic on the affected lanes during August 2015, while having both the company&#x27;s experts and Impregilo&#x27;s ones looking for the technical solutions to address the issues. As those solutions were discussed and agreed, lot 3 was closed down to traffic, initially for about one month and a half, just nine months after it was inaugurated. According to information surfacing from various sources about one kilometer from the motorway will need to be completely rebuilt from the ground while other issues that appeared will be addressed as well. During October and November 2015 the conflict between CNADNR and Impregilo seems to have taken a turn for worse as after the promised one month and a half term passed no substantial progress has been made on fixing the identified problems, the construction works on the lot were completely stopped and CNADNR announced it made a penal complaint against Impregilo. Six months after the closing, come the spring of 2016, the CNADNR decided to fix the problems itself with its own workforce and rented equipment; part of the financing of these repairs was to come from the 90 million lei guarantee posted for the project by Impregilo, which was to be blacklisted for two years in which it would not be allowed to obtain contracts from the Romanian government.

On 10 October 2016, the lot 3 was re-opened after repairing works had reportedly been completed.

===Orăștie – Deva===
This section of the motorway is fully operational and is composed of two segments: Orăștie – Simeria and Simeria – Deva.

Bids for the construction works for this section were launched by CNADNR during 2006 and subsequently during September 2009, but they were both cancelled due to problems related to the selection criteria. The bid was launched again during March 2010 and the whole section (32.8 km) was finally awarded to the joint venture between the Austrian company Strabag and the Romanian company Straco Grup in November 2010, after appeals from the competing companies. Construction works have started in April 2011 and were planned to finish in April 2013. The Simeria – Deva segment (15.4 km) was opened during December 2012, while the Orăștie – Simeria segment (17.4 km) was opened during May 2013.

===Deva – Lugoj===
This section of the motorway is partially operational and partially under construction and is split into four segments: Șoimuș – Ilia (lot 4), Ilia – Coșevița (lot 3), Coșevița – Dumbrava (lot 2) and Dumbrava – Șanovița (lot 1).

The bid for the design &amp; build contract for lot 1 was launched by CNADNR during December 2010. The contract included also the first segment of the A6 motorway (11.4 km) that is branching off from the A1 motorway near the village of Balinț and connecting the city of Lugoj. The Șanovița – Dumbrava segment (27.4 km) was awarded to a joint venture composed of Italian companies Tirrena Scavi, Societa Italiana per Condotte D&#x27;Acqua and Cossi Construzioni in May 2011, after an appeal from one of the bid participants. Construction works on lot 1 have started in October 2011 and were planned to finish in April 2013. After several delays, the segment was eventually opened during December 2013, but only between the junction with the A6 motorway and Dumbrava. As of July 2015 the remaining part of lot 1 was still not usable, as the next segment containing an exit (Timișoara – Lugoj lot 2) was not opened for traffic. The idea of building a temporary exit at the western end of the segment near Șanovița was discussed but never implemented. Another option discussed, considering that Timișoara – Lugoj lot 2 was awarded to the same joint venture of companies was a partial opening from Șanovița to Topolovățu Mare interchange with DJ572 (6.02 km), but this was not pursued either.

The bid for the design &amp; build contracts for the remaining three segments that are part of this section was launched by CNADNR during April 2012. After more than one year after the bid was launched, the Ilia – Șoimuș segment (22.1 km) was awarded to a joint venture composed of Romanian companies Spedition UMB and Tehnostrade in July 2013, while the Dumbrava – Coșevița segment (28.6 km) was awarded to a joint venture composed of Italian companies Salini Impregilo and Secol, and the Coșevița – Ilia segment (21.1 km) was awarded to a joint-venture led by the Spanish company Comsa, both in October 2013. Constructions works for lots 2, 3 and 4 were planned to finish in May 2016, however the lots face multiple issues: a revision of the environmental study imposed a number of changes to structures among which the requirement for a number of ecoducts for protecting the large carnivore fauna in the area, which called for an additional bid to cover for the changes; on lot 4 an illegal cemetery was discovered on the path of the motorway and was relocated, the motorway route was passing by too close to a cave near Brănișca which was supposedly housing a significant bat population protected by law and there were discussions between Spedition UMB and CNADNR regarding a potential change of the technical solution in the area of the Mintia ash and clay deposit. In an interview given by the general manager of CNADNR during August 2015, it was announced that the problems on lot 4 were now cleared and Spedition UMB was praised for their approach and pace of work on the segment, the appreciation being that if the issues hadn&#x27;t surfaced most probably the works would have been completed by end of 2015.

On 6 March 2017, a part of lot 2, between Dumbrava and Margina was opened to traffic.

By April 2019, the physical progress was at 95.8% on lot 2 (except tunnels), 94% on lot 3 and 95% on lot 4. The bid for the new planned tunnels on lot 2, claimed publicly since December 2014, was finally announced in June 2019. 

On 14 August 2019, lot 4 of the motorway was opened, whereas the lot 3 was opened on 23 December, same year, with speed and tonnage restrictions. Both restrictions on the latter were lifted gradually throughout the following year. In October 2022, the remainder segments of lot 2 were signed with Spedition UMB, the section is supposed to finish by 2026, and 11 months would be for the project phase, and 45 months for the execution.

===Lugoj – Timișoara===
This section of the motorway is fully operational and is composed of two segments: Giarmata – Izvin (lot 1) and Izvin – Șanovița (lot 2).

The Timișoara bypass (9.5 km, also referred to as the Timișoara – Lugoj lot 1) was awarded in April 2011 to the Romanian company Spedition UMB. It was opened to traffic in October 2012.

The stretch between Timișoara and Lugoj (25.6 km, referred to as the Timișoara – Lugoj lot 2) has been re-auctioned in August 2012, after appeals from participants at the previous auction. It has been awarded to the joint venture between the Italian companies Tirrena Scavi and Societa Italiana Per Condotte D&#x27;Acqua in December 2013. Construction works have been completed seven months earlier than the contractual deadline and the segment became operational in December 2015.

===Timișoara – Arad===
This section of the motorway is fully operational and is composed of two segments: Timișoara – Arad and Arad bypass.

Works for the Arad bypass (12.25 km) were awarded in March 2009 to the joint venture between the Spanish company FCC Construccion and the Austrian company Porr. The segment was opened in on a single carriageway December 2011, and on both carriageways in June 2012.

The 32.25 km section of motorway between Arad and Timișoara was awarded in December 2008 to the joint venture between the Spanish company FCC Construccion and the Italian company Astaldi. It was opened along with the Arad bypass in December 2011.

===Arad – Nădlac===
The construction of the 38.8 km section between Nădlac and Arad was split into two parts. The first part, between Nădlac and Pecica (22.2 km), was awarded in April 2011 to a consortium led by the Romanian company Romstrade, while the second section, between Pecica and Arad (16.6 km), was to be constructed by the Austrian company Alpine. Works started in October 2011 and were due to be finalized in April 2013.

However, the contract for the first part of the section was terminated by the Romanian government in November 2012, due to low construction progress recorded by the Romstrade company (approximately 15–20%) and potential fraud by the company owner. Also, the contract for the second part (construction progress approximately 85%) was terminated in July 2013, because the Austrian company filed for bankruptcy. The first segment was re-auctioned in April 2013, and awarded in December 2013 to the joint venture of Astaldi and Max Bögl. Works should be completed until the end of 2014. A tender for the remaining works on the second segment was announced in June 2014, and the section was finally awarded to the same joint venture of Astaldi and Max Bögl.

The section between Nădlac and Pecica and 6.30 km of the section between Pecica and Arad ware opened ahead of schedule on December 19, 2014. The remainder of the Pecica – Arad segment (10.3 km) was opened on 11 July 2015.

At the western end, the motorway connects with Hungary&#x27;s M43 motorway, which further connects with the M5 motorway, that runs from the border with Serbia to the capital city of Budapest. A connecting road between the motorway (near the border crossing) and the town of Nădlac (approximately 7 km southbound), designated as DN7G, has also been built.

<text>Topological Boolean algebra may refer to:

* In abstract algebra and mathematical logic, topological Boolean algebra is one of the many names that have been used for an interior algebra in the literature.
* In the work of the mathematician R.S. Pierce, a topological Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra equipped with both a closure operator and a derivative operator generalizing T1 topological spaces and may be considered to be a special case of interior algebras rather than synonymous with them.
* In topological algebra — the study of topological spaces with algebraic structure, a topological Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra endowed with a topological structure in which the operations of complement, join, and meet are continuous functions.</text><links>

<text>OTRS (originally Open-Source Ticket Request System) is a service management suite. The suite contains an agent portal, admin dashboard and customer portal. In the agent portal, teams process tickets and requests from customers (internal or external). There are various ways in which this information, as well as customer and related data can be viewed. As the name implies, the admin dashboard allows system administrators to manage the system: Options are many, but include roles and groups, process automation, channel integration, and CMDB/database options. The third component, the customer portal, is much like a customizable webpage where information can be shared with customers and requests can be tracked on the customer side.

==History==
In 2001, OTRS began as an open source help desk ticketing software.

In 2003, OTRS GmbH was formed and a professional company entered the EMEA market. This was followed in 2006 by entry into the North American market.

In 2007, the company was renamed to OTRS AG with the intention of going public, which it did in 2009. This is the same year in which OTRS was brought to Latin America with the Mexican subsidiary officially being founded in 2010. Entry into the APAC region occurred in 2011.

In 2015, a new version of the software, known as &quot;OTRS Business Solution&quot;, was launched. This proprietary version was designed for professional users who needed additional support, configuration and features.

In 2018, both OTRS-specific products were renamed: The open source version became &quot;((OTRS)) Community Edition&quot;. The proprietary and managed version is named &quot;OTRS&quot;. A third offering, also proprietary, is called &quot;OTRS On-Premise&quot; for professional customers who intend to host the platform in their own data centers.

In December 2020, OTRS AG announced the end of life of support for the Community Edition which led to several forks. Alongside its customers was Wikimedia Foundation, which used ((OTRS)) Community Edition to run Wikimedia OTRS system; after its discontinuation, in April 2021, it was migrated to Znuny, a fork of ((OTRS)) Community Edition. Being no longer ran on original OTRS software, the system was renamed .

In December 2024, the French company EasyVista acquired a majority stake in OTRS AG.

== OTRS Group ==

OTRS GmbH was originally founded in 2003 by André Mindermann (CEO) and Burchard Steinbild (chairman of the supervisory board). In 2007, the company became OTRS Group, also known as OTRS AG. In addition to the two, today&#x27;s management board includes Christopher Kuhn (COO), Sabine Riedel (board member, Marketing, HR), Gabriele Brauer (VP Finance) and Manuel Hecht (VP Global Software Development).

OTRS AG is the source code owner of OTRS.

The OTRS Group has its headquarters in Germany. There are six subsidiaries worldwide, including OTRS Inc. (USA), OTRS S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), OTRS ASIA Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), OTRS Asia Ltd. (Hong Kong), (Brazil), and OTRS Magyarország Kft. (Hungary).

OTRS AG is listed in the Basic Board of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

== Technical notes ==
Since its beginnings OTRS has been implemented in the programming language Perl. The web interface is made user-friendly by using JavaScript (which can be switched off for security reasons). The OTRS web interface uses the Template::Toolkit rendering engine to dynamically generate the HTML output of individual frontend modules. This approach allows the underlying logic of the OTRS frontend modules (written in Perl) to remain separate from the presentation of each module&#x27;s user interface (served as HTML to the user).

Originally, OTRS supported only the use of a MySQL RDBMS for use as the webserver database. Support has since been added for PostgreSQL, Oracle, IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, and MariaDB (a community-developed fork of MySQL). OTRS may be used on many UNIX or UNIX-like platforms (e.g. Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) as well as on Microsoft Windows.

The scalability of OTRS systems may be increased by using mod perl for the Apache Webserver or by separating the database and web server systems, allowing a large number of simultaneously working agents and high volumes of tickets.

<doc id="993264" wikidata="Q6198196" url="?curid=993264" title="Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)">
<text>James Michael Smith (17 October 1940 – 10 December 2019) was an English footballer and manager. As a player, he made 249 appearances in the Fourth Division of the Football League, representing Aldershot, Halifax Town, Lincoln City and Colchester United, and played for years for Boston United of the Northern Premier League. He began a long managerial career with Boston United, and went on to take charge of top division clubs such as Birmingham City, Newcastle United and Derby County. Smith served as a member of the board of directors of Oxford United for three years from 2006 to 2009. He served as the League Managers&#x27; Association&#x27;s chief executive and was inducted into their Hall of Fame for managing over 1000 matches. He was nicknamed &quot;The Bald Eagle&quot;.

==Playing career==
Smith was born in Sheffield and grew up a Sheffield Wednesday supporter, but began his playing career in 1957 when he signed for Sheffield United as an amateur, and turned professional with the club two years later. After failing to break into the first team he was transferred to Aldershot for the 1961–62 season.

At the beginning of the 1965–66 season, after scoring one goal in 74 league appearances, Smith left Aldershot to join Halifax Town. He made 113 league starts for Halifax, scoring seven goals, before moving to Lincoln City in 1968. After just over a year at Lincoln in which he made 54 appearances Smith signed for non-league club Boston United as player-manager; as player, he went on to make nearly 200 appearances for the club in all competitions.

==Managerial career==
A good start to his managerial career at Boston – the club finished in the top four of the Northern Premier League in each of his first three seasons, he led them to the third round proper of the 1972 FA Cup, and in his fourth season, was 40 games into a run of 51 consecutive league games unbeaten, a British record at professional level – led to Colchester United offering Smith the position of manager in October 1972. In his autobiography, Smith says that he thought he got the job on the basis that he told the directors that he thought the team were &#x27;bloody awful&#x27; when watching a game with them, and they respected his honesty. He retained his playing registration for that season, but in 1973–74, he retired from playing and guided Colchester to promotion from the Football League Fourth Division.

In 1975, he quit the club to join Blackburn Rovers, newly promoted to the Second Division.

He led Blackburn through one season of survival, one of establishment and was well into a promotion push in his third season when he left for First Division Birmingham City in March 1978 after Sir Alf Ramsey&#x27;s resignation.

Birmingham were relegated from the First Division in Smith&#x27;s first full season in charge, but he rebuilt the team, allowing many of the players who had won promotion in 1972 to leave, most notably making Trevor Francis the first £1 million player, a move which the board had not allowed Ramsey to make, and introducing both experienced players and promising youngsters.

Smith guided Birmingham back into the top flight the next season, and maintained them in mid-table in 1981. In early 1982, Ron Saunders walked out on Aston Villa, the club he had led to the League title the previous season; Birmingham promptly sacked Smith and appointed Saunders. In his book, Smith reckons the decision by Birmingham to sack him was taken on the coach journey home from the final game of the season.

A few weeks later, Smith joined Oxford United as manager. He led them to the Third Division championship in 1984. The next year they were again promoted, reaching the top flight for the first time in their history, as Oxford won the Second Division championship. Despite this spectacular success, chairman Robert Maxwell failed to improve Smith&#x27;s contract, which led to his resignation from Oxford to take the job of manager at Queens Park Rangers.

In his first year at QPR, Smith took the club to the League Cup final, where they lost 3–0 to his former club Oxford United. Smith continued to manage QPR until December 1988 when he left to become manager of Newcastle United. Newcastle finished bottom of the First Division in 1989; they came close to making an immediate return, finishing third in the league but losing 2–0 in the playoff semi-final to local rivals Sunderland at St James&#x27; Park. With no prospect of promotion by March 1991, Smith resigned amid a boardroom power struggle at the club.

He had a spell as coach at Middlesbrough under Colin Todd before accepting the appointment as manager of Portsmouth in the summer of 1991. He had a fairly successful reign at Fratton Park for four years, including reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1992, in which they took Liverpool to a replay before losing on penalties after extra time. A year later, a successful season in the league meant that they missed out on automatic promotion to the Premier League only on goal difference and then lost in the playoffs. Key players including Darren Anderton and Guy Whittingham were sold, and there was no money for adequate replacements. Smith was sacked in January 1995 after a decline in form left them struggling at the wrong end of Division One.

Smith became chief executive of the League Managers&#x27; Association in 1995, but returned to club management that summer with Derby County.

He brought in Steve McClaren as first-team coach, and in their first full season they guided Derby to runners-up spot in Division One and promotion to the Premier League. Derby finished in the top half of the table for their first three seasons in the top flight, but after two seasons where relegation was only narrowly avoided, Smith was offered, and refused, the post of Director of Football. He resigned in October 2001, to be replaced by Colin Todd. Derby had spent 5 consecutive seasons in the top flight under Jim Smith.

In January 2002, Smith was appointed assistant manager at Coventry City, working alongside Roland Nilsson. Smith and Nilsson were sacked three months later, after presiding over performances described as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; and failing to achieve a playoff place. Later that year, Harry Redknapp appointed Smith as his assistant at former club Portsmouth. Smith helped Redknapp win the Division One title at the first attempt in 2002–03, and played his part as the club established itself in the Premier League. In November 2004, both Smith and Redknapp resigned from Portsmouth after the appointment of a Director of Football. Redknapp became the manager of Southampton two weeks later, and after rejecting the position of chief scout, Smith was appointed his assistant. As part of a &quot;cost-cutting exercise&quot; following Southampton&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, Smith&#x27;s initial six-month contract was not extended.

After nearly a year out of football, Smith returned to front-line management in March 2006 as manager of Oxford United for the second time, and was also given a seat on the board of directors.

He failed to stave off relegation to the Conference National, but they came close to an immediate return to the Football League, finishing second and losing on penalties in the 2006–07 play-off semi-final. In November 2007, after a poor start to the season, Smith decided it was time to &quot;put the interests of the club before his own and ... step down as manager and concentrate on his director&#x27;s role full-time&quot;.

Following the sacking of Darren Patterson in November 2008, Smith took over as caretaker manager; the team remained unbeaten for the few weeks until Chris Wilder&#x27;s appointment. Smith stepped down from the board in 2009.

==Death==
Smith died on 10 December 2019 at the age of 79.

<text>Acland Street is a street in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, which enjoys great popularity as a recreational area, mainly due to its many restaurants and its proximity to the entertainment areas along St Kilda beach

==Route==
Acland Street runs on a north-west to south-east axis between Fitzroy and Barkly Streets. It was one of the first streets laid out when St Kilda was surveyed in 1842.

The north-west end of the street is largely residential, and features many fine houses from the late 19th century, some of them converted to flats or other uses, such as the Linden Gallery, and earlier, Acland Street Gallery, which was at number 18, and closed in 1990. The south-east end of the street, between Carlisle and Barkly Streets, is a commercial strip. The section of Acland Street between Barkly Street and Carlisle Street is a tram zone where route 96 terminates.

==History==
Acland Street is named for Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, who owned the schooner &quot;Lady of St Kilda&quot; between 1834 and 1840. The street was named by James Ross Lawrence, who had been master of the vessel until 1842.

Lawrence was the buyer of the first block at the first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda, which took place on 7 December 1842. The block was bounded by three unmade roads, one of which he named Acland Street after Thomas Acland, who had been his employer until 1840 but who had never been to Port Phillip District. The other two roads became Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade. (A plaque at the junction of Acland and Fitzroy Streets marks the site of the block.)
By the 1880s, what is now the commercial end of the street was residential, with a string of large houses in large gardens, similar to the rest of the street. As St Kilda evolved into a playground for the masses in the early 20th century, with electric tram lines running to the front of Luna Park and down this end of Acland Street, the mansions and gardens were replaced with shops in the 1920s and 30s.
By the 1930s these shops had become of the centres of Melbourne&#x27;s Jewish community, which grew greatly in size with European refugees before and after World War II, and Acland Street featured a number of shops and restaurants catering to this community. In the 1968, the Balberyszski bookshop moved into Acland Street, staying on till the 1990s. The Scheherezade cafe, established in 1958, was the most representative and popular part of this heritage, and served up borscht and latkes for decades. A number of cake shops specialising in Central and East European fare such as Kugelhopf and Black Forest Cake were also established in this period. By the 1980s, the centre of Jewish Melbourne had moved eastwards to more affluent Caulfield, and Acland street became less European and more for weekend tourists, until finally Scheherazade moved to Caulfield in 2008. The remaining cake shops of Acland Street are a reminder of this community, though most are no longer run by Jewish owners.

The junction of Acland and Barkly Streets is known as the Village Belle, after the Village Belle Hotel, which stands on Barkly Street opposite the end of Acland Street. Near the junction of Carlisle Street and Acland Street is Luna Park, one of Australia&#x27;s best-known amusement parks, which attracts large crowds during the summer. Almost next door is one of Melbourne&#x27;s grandest theatres, the Palais Theatre. Also on Acland Street is the St Kilda Army and Navy Club, built in 1923 with a hall on the first floor, a cinema to the rear, and flats for retired service personnel on top.

Today Acland Street has many restaurants offering a variety of cuisines, including Vietnamese, Indian, Italian and Malaysian. A large McDonald&#x27;s now stands on the corner of Acland and Carlisle Streets. In 2016 Acland Street was closed between Belford and Barkly Streets to through vehicular traffic with the tram stop rebuilt with two side platforms.

<doc id="993267" wikidata="Q1173262" url="?curid=993267" title="Dave Koz">
<text>David Stephen Koz (born March 27, 1963) is an American saxophonist, composer, record producer, and radio personality based in California.

==Early life==
Dave Koz was born in Encino, California, to Jewish parents: Norman, a dermatologist and Audrey, a pharmacist. Dave has a brother, Jeff, who is also a musician, and a sister, Roberta. Although he is Jewish, Koz plays both Christmas and occasional Hanukkah songs at his concerts. He attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, performing on saxophone as a member of the school jazz band. He later graduated from UCLA with a degree in mass communications in 1986, and only weeks after his graduation, decided to make a go of becoming a professional musician.

==Career==

Within weeks of deciding to be a professional musician, he was recruited as a member of Bobby Caldwell&#x27;s tour. Koz was originally a rock saxophonist before he moved to smooth jazz in 1989. For the rest of the 1980s, Koz served as a session musician in several rock bands, and toured with Jeff Lorber. Koz was a member of rock musician Richard Marx&#x27;s band and toured with Marx throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was around the time he recurred as the guest saxophonist on the syndicated late-night talk show &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. He also played in the house band of CBS&#x27; short-lived &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;, with Tom Scott as bandleader.

In 1989, Koz decided to pursue a solo career, and began recording for Capitol Records. His albums there include &quot;Dave Koz&quot; (his 1990 solo debut), &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, &quot;The Dance&quot;, and &quot;Saxophonic&quot;. &quot;Saxophonic&quot; was nominated for both a Grammy Award and an NAACP Image Award.

Koz released his second album, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, in 1993. During production of the album in 1992, Koz was approached by the producers of ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot; to perform on the show after his track entitled &quot;Emily&quot;, from his &quot;Dave Koz&quot; album, was used as part of the show&#x27;s soundtrack that year. After his &quot;GH&quot; appearance, executive producer Wendy Riche commissioned Koz to write a new theme song for the soap. Koz took elements from the show&#x27;s existing theme song, Jack Urbont&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Breeze&quot;, and merged the chorus notes into a brand new smooth jazz composition titled &quot;Faces of the Heart&quot;. The new theme music made its debut on &quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s 30th anniversary show, which aired April 1, 1993, and remained as the show&#x27;s title track until August 27, 2004. &quot;Faces of the Heart&quot; ended up as the third track on Koz&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Man&quot; album.

In 1994, Koz began hosting a syndicated radio program, &quot;The Dave Koz Radio Show&quot; (formerly &quot;Personal Notes&quot;), featuring the latest music and interviews with who&#x27;s who in the genre. Dave co-hosted &quot;The Dave Koz Morning Show&quot; on 94.7 The Wave, a smooth jazz station in Los Angeles for six years. He decided to leave the show in January 2007 and was replaced by Brian McKnight. In 2002, Koz started a record label, Rendezvous Entertainment, with Frank Cody and Hyman Katz.

Koz has promoted annual Dave Koz &amp; Friends Jazz Cruises since 2005.

Koz is the host of a weekly half-hour television series named &quot;Frequency&quot; put on by Fast Focus. Koz interviews musicians on the show such as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Jonathan Butler, and Kelly Sweet. At the end of each interview, he plays along with the musician, adding some of his saxophone riffs to one of their hit songs.

Koz was also the bandleader on &quot;The Emeril Lagasse Show&quot;. The band, &quot;Dave Koz &amp; The Kozmos&quot;, featured Jeff Golub (guitar), Philippe Saisse (keyboards), Conrad Korsch (bass guitar), and Skoota Warner (drums).

Koz hosts a weekly radio show on the Sirius-XM Radio Watercolors channel called &quot;The Dave Koz Lounge,&quot; which airs Sundays at noon ET.

On September 22, 2009, Koz received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In October 2010, Koz performed &quot;Start All Over Again&quot; in a &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; season 7 episode &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;, alongside singer Dana Glover. In July 2012, he appeared on &quot;The Eric André Show&quot;, season 1 episode 7, and sat in with the house band.

In December 2014, he opened Spaghettini &amp; the Dave Koz Lounge, a restaurant and live music venue located at 184 North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills, California with business partners Cary Hardwick and Laurie Sisneros, who own Spaghettini in Seal Beach.

In 2018, Koz collaborated with guitarist and regular Vulfpeck contributor, Cory Wong, on two tracks, &quot;The Optimist&quot; and &quot;Friends at Sea&quot;. The two collaborated again in 2021 for the album &quot;The Golden Hour&quot;, including the single &quot;Today&quot;.

In 2022, Koz collaborated with singer-songwriter Ben Rector on the track &quot;Supernatural&quot; from Rector&#x27;s album &quot;The Joy of Music&quot;.

== Instruments ==
Koz plays a Yamaha silver alto sax (YAS-62S Mk. I) with a No. 7 Beechler metal mouthpiece, a Yamaha straight silver Soprano sax (YSS-62S) or a vintage Conn curved soprano sax with a No. 8 Couf mouthpiece, and a Selmer Mark VI Tenor sax with a Berg-Larsen 90/2 hard rubber mouthpiece. As for reeds, he uses a No. 3 Rico Plasticover. Koz occasionally plays keyboards and piano, with which he also composes his songs.

==Personal life==
In an April 2004 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Koz came out publicly as gay. He has been a resident of Sausalito, California since 1990.

<doc id="993269" wikidata="Q7099603" url="?curid=993269" title="Orange Crate Art">
<text>Orange Crate Art is the first collaborative studio album by American musicians Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, released in 1995 on Warner Bros. Records. The album consists mostly of songs written and arranged by Parks, with Wilson featured as lead and backing vocalist. Its title refers to the sun-drenched, idealized paintings that grace wooden fruit crates, and its theme is a nostalgic view of the history of California.

==Background==
In the thirty years following their collaboration on the ill-fated Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smile&quot; project, Wilson and Parks had each developed their own solo careers.

Sometime in 1992, Parks approached a then-reclusive Wilson with the invitation to record an album together. Wilson was in the middle of a court-ordered removal and restraining order from his psychiatrist, which came as a result of years of overmedication and gross misconduct. According to Parks, &quot;The reason why I asked him was to take care of this unfinished business, and to try to escape from the tyranny of the sense of history that&#x27;s been placed on our own aborted effort. [&quot;Smile&quot;]&quot; Later adding, &quot;When I found him, he was alone in a room staring at a television. It was off.&quot;

It is reported that Wilson interrupted the first vocal session for the album by asking Parks, &quot;Wait a minute. What am I even doing here?&quot; Parks hit the talk button and responded, &quot;You’re here because I can’t stand the sound of my own voice!&quot; Wilson paused, nodded his head, and stepped up to the microphone proclaiming, &quot;Well, that makes sense! Okay, take one!&quot;

Though billed and anticipated as a full collaboration, the album is devoted to Parks&#x27; compositions, and features his typical dense wordplay and orchestrations. Wilson for his part contributes only the vocals and vocal arrangements. Parks also reported that despite his invitation, Wilson had declined to contribute any music to the project. Despite this, he was impassioned to record the album for Parks, determined to make something that he &quot;could live with&quot; ten years from then.

==Reception==

Given the history of its artists, the album came with high expectations, but upon release it received mixed critical reviews and had lackluster sales, failing even to chart. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic wrote, &quot;Van Dyke Parks&#x27; approach is intellectual, not instinctual, which means his compositions are over-labored and overwrought. Instead of making his melodies catchy, Parks makes sure they are complex, which means they are rarely memorable. Similarly, his lyrics are dense and laden with poetic imagery and metaphors, yet they are entirely too cerebral for a pop album. Then again, &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot; isn&#x27;t a pop album—it&#x27;s a self-conscious work of art.&quot;

Parks has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the album&#x27;s reception, saying &quot;It took three years and $350,000. The record came out and sank without a trace.&quot;

<doc id="993276" wikidata="Q42171" url="?curid=993276" title="Rimantadine">
<text>Rimantadine (INN, sold under the trade name Flumadine) is an orally administered antiviral drug used to treat, and in rare cases prevent, influenzavirus A infection. When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, rimantadine can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Rimantadine can mitigate symptoms, including fever. Both rimantadine and the similar drug amantadine are derivates of adamantane. Rimantadine is found to be more effective than amantadine because when used the patient displays fewer symptoms. Rimantadine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994.

Rimantadine was approved for medical use in 1993. Seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to rimantadine, and it is no longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu.

==Medical uses==

=== Influenza A ===
Rimantadine inhibits influenza activity by binding to amino acids in the M2 transmembrane channel and blocking proton transport across the M2 channel. Rimantadine is believed to inhibit influenza&#x27;s viral replication, possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus&#x27;s protective shells, which are the envelope and capsid. The M2 channel is known to be responsible for viral replication in the influenza virus. Genetic studies suggest that the virus M2 protein, an ion channel specified by virion M2 gene, plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine.

Rimantadine is bound inside the pore to amantadine specific amino acid binding sites with hydrogen binding and van der Waals interactions. The ammonium group (with neighboring water molecules) is positioned towards the C terminus with the amantadane group is positioned towards the N-terminus when bound inside the M2 pore.

==== Influenza resistance ====
Resistance to rimantadine can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel.

The mutation S31N binding site with rimantadine is shown in the image to the left. It shows rimantadine binding into lumenal (top) or peripheral (bottom) binding sites with influenza M2 channel Serine 31 (gold) or Asparagine 31 (blue).

==== Rimantadine enantiomers interactions with M2 ====
Rimantadine, when sold as flumadine, is present as a racemic mixture; the R and S states are both present in the drug. Solid state NMR studies have shown that the R enantiomer has a stronger binding affinity to the M2 channel pore than the S-enantiomer of rimantadine. Antiviral assay and electrophysiology studies show that there is no significant difference between the R and S enantiomers in binding affinity to amino acids in the M2 channel. Since the enantiomers have similar binding affinity, they also have similar ability to block the channel pore and work as an effective antiviral.

Rimantadine enantiomers R and S are pictured interacting with the M2 pore below to the right. This image shows that there is not a significant modeled difference between the R and S enantiomers.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Rimantadine, like its antiviral cousin amantadine, possesses antiparkinsonian activity and can be used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, in general, neither rimantadine nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments.

=== Others ===
Rimantadine is shown to be effective against other RNA-containing viruses. It can treat arboviruses like Saint Louis encephalitis and Sindbis. Other viruses that can be treated with Rimantadine include respiratory synctial and parainfluenza viruses. Rimantadine has also been shown to treat chronic hepatitis C.

==Side effects==
Rimantadine can produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects. Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200 mg/d. 

Common side effects include:
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Nervousness
* Tiredness
* Lightheadedness
* Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
* Difficulty concentrating
* Confusion

Rimantadine shows fewer CNS symptoms than its sister drug amantadine.

==Interactions==
* Taking paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) while taking rimantadine is known to reduce the body&#x27;s uptake of rimantadine by approximately 12%.
* Cimetidine also affects the body&#x27;s uptake of rimantadine.
* Taking anticholinergic drugs with amantadine may increase underlying seizure disorders and aggravate congestive heart failure.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
The related drugs memantine and to a much lesser extent amantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists. The affinity of rimantadine for the NMDA receptor does not seem to have been reported. Analogues of rimantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists.

== Chemistry ==

=== Synthesis ===
1-carboxyadamatanones are reduced with sodium borohydride to create racemic hydroxy acid. Excess methyllithium is then added to create methyl ketones which when reduced with lithium aluminum hydride gives the amine group.

The synthesis pictured to the left is a synthesis of rimantadine as synthesized in Europe.

== History ==
Rimantadine was discovered in 1963 and patented in 1965 in the US by William W. Prichard in Du Pont &amp; Co., Wilmington, Delaware (patent on new chemical compound , 1965 and on the first method of synthesis , 1967). Prichard&#x27;s methods of synthesis of rimantadine from the corresponding ketone oxime were based on its reduction with lithium aluminum hydride.

<text>Royal Air Force Topcliffe or RAF Topcliffe is a Royal Air Force station in North Yorkshire, England.

It was established as a RAF Bomber Command station in 1940. The British Army took over a large part of the site in 1974 and the airfield became an enclave within Alanbrooke Barracks. The last remaining RAF unit is No. 645 Volunteer Gliding Squadron which operates the Grob Viking T.1 glider.

==History==

=== Second World War ===
Royal Air Force Topcliffe opened in September 1940 as a bomber station in RAF Bomber Command and was home to No. 77 Squadron and No. 102 Squadron, both flying the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley heavy bomber. There was a decoy site at Raskelf. No. 419 Squadron and No. 424 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) moved in flying Vickers Wellington bombers and later, the Handley Page Halifax III. On 1 January 1943 the station was transferred to No. 6 Group RCAF and became a training station. No. 61 (RCAF) Base RAF was here between 25 March 1943 and November 1944 and became No. 76 (RCAF) Base RAF with the unit disbanding on 1 September 1945, the unit controlled sub-stations at Wombleton, Dalton and Dishforth.

;Units:
* 801 Naval Air Squadron
* 812 Naval Air Squadron
* 813 Naval Air Squadron
* 824 Naval Air Squadron
* No. 405 Squadron RCAF between 1 and 6 March 1943 with the Halifax II
* No. 16 Blind Approach Training Flight RAF between 22 September 1941 and October 1941 became No. 1516 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF until 17 November 1941
* No. 102 Conversion Flight RAF between 10 June 1942 and 7 August 1942
* No. 405 Conversion Flight RAF between 7 August and 7 October 1942
* No. 1659 Heavy Conversion Unit RAF between 14 March and 16 September 1943
* No. 2805 Squadron RAF Regiment

=== Cold War ===

No. 1 Air Navigation School was initially here between 9 April 1947 and 1 May 1954 with Wellingtons and Ansons. Navigation Staff Pilot(s) Training Flight RAF was here between October 1948 and December 1949 within No. 1 ANS. The School was reformed here and operated between 15 March 1957 and 1 December 1961. 

The Air Electronics School RAF arrived on 14 January 1962 and from 30 January 1967 became the Air Electronics and Engineers School RAF, flying the Vickers Varsity T.1 until 26 October 1973.

From 1 October 1964, the Northern Communications Squadron RAF flew the Avro Anson C.19, replacing them with Beagle Basset CC.1 before the squadron departed on 6 January 1969.

The Airman Aircrew Initial Training School was located at Topcliffe from 30 January 1967 until February 1970 when it was disbanded into 6 FTS.

No. 15 Aviation Flight of the Army Air Corps flew the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver AL.1 from the early 1970s and No. 666 Aviation Squadron AAC flew Westland Scout AH.1 helicopters between 1973 and 1978.

Between 1972 and 1973, most of the station was transferred to the British Army and became Alanbrooke Barracks.

During the 1980s, Topcliffe was home of the Royal Navy Elementary Flying Training Squadron. From 24 April 1995 it was temporarily home to a Short Tucano squadron of the RAF Central Flying School. It was the home of the Tucano Air Navigation Squadron, teaching student navigators of both the RAF and the Royal Navy until 2003, when it moved to RAF Linton-on-Ouse.

During the 1990s and until 2001, the airfield was utilised by Merlin Parachute Club, home to both the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment parachute display team and the University of York Sport Parachute Club.

=== 21st century ===
No. 645 Volunteer Gliding Squadron moved to the airfield in 2003, after their previous home at the former RAF Catterick became increasingly unusable.

No. 635 Volunteer Gliding Squadron also operated from Topcliffe from 2009 when it moved from its former home at RAF Samlesbury. The unit disbanded in 2016 as part of the relaunch of air cadet aviation.

RAF Topcliffe was a satellite station which served in the role of a Relief Landing Ground for Short Tucano T.1 aircraft of No. 1 Flying Training School previously based nearby at RAF Linton-on-Ouse (one of two, the other being Dishforth Airfield).

Tucano Element of No. 6 Flying Training School RAF between April 1995 and March 1996 and Joint Elementary Flying Training School RAF between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1995.

In 2012, Yorkshire Air Ambulance moved their second base to RAF Topcliffe from nearby Bagby Airfield.

== Role and operations ==
Since the British Army took over a large part of the site in 1974 to establish Alanbrooke Barracks, the airfield is now enclosed within the Barracks.

The last remaining RAF unit based at Topcliffe is No. 645 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which teaches Air Cadets to fly the Grob Viking T.1.

As of March 2012, the station is the permanent base of G-YOAA one of the two Yorkshire Air Ambulances.

<text>The Energizer Bunny is the mascot of Energizer batteries in North America. It is a pink mechanical toy rabbit with an Energizer battery on its left knee wearing sunglasses and blue and black striped flip-flops that beats a bass drum bearing the Energizer logo.

==History==
The Energizer Bunny was first created as a parody of the Duracell Bunny, which first appeared in television advertising in 1973, in its &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; commercial. Duracell had purportedly trademarked the drumming bunny character, but whether they had or not, said trademark had lapsed by 1988, providing Energizer an opening to create their own trademark.

The first Energizer Bunny commercial was broadcast on United States television on October 30, 1988. Produced by DDB Needham Worldwide, the spot began as a direct parody of Duracell&#x27;s &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; ad. In the original Duracell ads, a set of battery-powered drum-playing toy rabbits gradually slow to a halt until only the toy powered by a Duracell copper-top battery remains active. In Energizer&#x27;s parody, the Energizer Bunny enters the screen midway through the ad, beating a huge bass drum and swinging a mallet over his head.

The Energizer Bunny is promoted as being able to continue operating indefinitely, or at least much longer than similar toys (or other products) using rival brands&#x27; batteries. The criticism was that Duracell compared their batteries with carbon-zinc batteries, and not similar alkaline batteries like Energizer. The creative team at D.D.B. Chicago who conceived and designed the bunny chose All Effects special effects company to build the original Energizer Bunny, a remote-controlled prop. All Effects operated the Energizer Bunny in most of its first commercials.

In subsequent commercials, the Bunny left the studio in which it had performed the &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; ad to wander onto the sets of realistic-looking commercials for fictional products, interrupting their action. As the campaign progressed, many of these ads were standalone (for fictional products such as &quot;Sitagin Hemorrhoid Remedy&quot;, &quot;Nasotine Sinus Relief&quot;, &quot;TresCafe Coffee&quot;, &quot;Alarm&quot; deodorant soap, etc.) and even a few featured celebrities, such as Lyle Alzado promoting a snack called &quot;Pigskins&quot;, and Ted Nugent doing an ad for a Mexican food chain called &quot;Cucaracha&quot;) only to have the Bunny march through, beating his drum, because he was &quot;still going&quot;. One infamous commercial was for a fictional long-distance telephone company with a couple in the United Kingdom talking to their son, who was supposedly in New York and exclaimed that he &quot;sounded like he&#x27;s right next door&quot;, and when the Bunny came in, he knocked down the divider to show they really were next to each other). Eventually real-life products and icons would do a crossover with the Energizer Bunny (Michael J. Fox doing a Pepsi ad, and the opening of TV shows such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;). The Energizer Bunny has appeared in more than 115 television commercials. In these commercials, a voice-over would announce one of various slogans used throughout the years; all of them would relate the stalwartness of the Energizer Bunny to the long-lasting power of their batteries. The original slogan boasted that &quot;...[n]othing outlasts the Energizer...&quot;, but it was eventually changed after a lawsuit filed by Duracell disputing Energizer&#x27;s claim. Those commercials with the bunny interrupting all the action in a commercial were eventually spoofed in the 1993 film &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;, featuring a blue animal drumming through instead of the pink bunny. The two people fighting then use their guns to shoot the animal, which explodes.

===1990s===
In the 1990s advertisements featuring the Energizer Bunny were made by a variety of companies, including Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Cafe FX and Method Studios. Eric Allard&#x27;s All Effects Company however did the bulk of the live action Energizer Bunny building, maintenance and puppeteering with ILM taking over for later commercials.

From 1993 to 1995, Energizer ran a series of commercials featuring a fictional rival battery called &quot;Supervolt&quot; including a Supervolt weasel mascot, which was an obvious lookalike of Duracell. As Supervolt&#x27;s battery sales had fallen, the company&#x27;s CEO (portrayed by Rip Torn) sought to neutralize the Energizer Bunny by targeting its battery. Supervolt&#x27;s CEO sought out people who could help him. At this time, the position of the battery moved from its leg to its back.

* The first ad starred a Blofeld-like evil genius (portrayed by Joss Ackland) who planned to use the Matter Disintegrator to destroy the battery. It shut down when the Supervolt batteries in it ran out.
* The second ad starred King Kong where Supervolt&#x27;s CEO gave him a reward card (for bananas). When cornering the Energizer Bunny on the Empire State Building, a woman who King Kong angered slammed a window down on his foot, causing him to fall off the Empire State Building.

In many of the associated commercials that followed, villains such as Darth Vader, the Wicked Witch of the West, Wile E. Coyote, Boris and Natasha, as well as a robotic flea, would try to destroy or capture the Bunny only to see complications arise when their devices using Supervolt batteries ran out or other circumstances allowed for the bunny&#x27;s escape. In addition, a flock of vultures and a foxhunt would get exhausted trying to catch the Energizer Bunny and the Grim Reaper gave up waiting for the Energizer Bunny to come with him.

The &quot;Blofeld&quot; ad showed the quality of the product being advertised when it created complications for the villain – so as not to imply that Energizer was better than any other brand, as well as to encourage people to buy Energizer batteries for their smoke detectors.

===2016===
In September 2016, Energizer switched their advertising agency to Camp+King and introduced a new more expressive bunny who is slimmer and has more facial expression. The bunny will keep the signature drum, flip flops, and dark sunglasses, but the pink fur will be more realistic.

==Campaign success==
Despite the immense popularity of the campaign, sales of Energizer batteries actually went down during the years that the ads ran. Duracell claimed that 40 percent of its customers thought the campaign was promoting Duracell, not Energizer, but provided no evidence. Speculation has it that TV watchers still associated pink bunnies with Duracell, so the Energizer ads were actually helping their competitor&#x27;s sales rather than their own.

==In popular culture==
In North America the term &quot;Energizer Bunny&quot; has entered the vernacular as a term for anything that continues endlessly, or someone that has immense stamina. In Europe and Australia the term &quot;Duracell Bunny&quot; has a similar connotation. Several U.S. presidential candidates have compared themselves to the bunny, including President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and Howard Dean in 2004.

In 1992, the company PC Dynamics created a Screen Saver for Windows 3.x featuring Energizer Bunny with audio clips from the commercials.

Energizer was the corporate sponsor of Star Tours at Disneyland Park and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios for several years; the bunny appeared in several ride-themed advertisements around the show&#x27;s exit. The promotional poster along the exit ramp for Star Tours is one of the few appearances that shows the battery on his back.

In 2006, an Energizer Bunny balloonicle debuted in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and appeared until 2011.

On October 31, 2007, TY released an Energizer Bunny Beanie Baby as a Walgreens Exclusive with a birthday of November 23, 2007. The poem on the tag reads:

&quot;Whether at home, at work or play

Nothing will get in E.B.’s way

And here’s one thing that’s sure worth knowing

This bunny just keeps going and going!&quot;

==Legal challenges==

=== 1990 Duracell trademark dispute ===
When Energizer&#x27;s 1988 parody became an advertising success and Energizer trademarked its bunny, Duracell decided to revive the Duracell Bunny campaign and filed for a new United States trademark of its own, citing the original use of the character more than a decade earlier. The dispute resulted in a confidential January 10, 1992 out of court settlement, where Energizer (and its bunny) took exclusive trademark rights in the United States and Canada, and Duracell (and its bunny) took exclusive rights in all other places in the world, which caused the Energizer Bunny to be phased out in most countries. The Energizer Bunny was succeeded by Mr. Energizer, who appeared in Stop motion advertisements voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. In certain Latin American countries that kept the Energizer Bunny after 1992 and did not replace the character with Mr. Energizer, it coexists with Duracell Bunny.

=== 1991 Adolph Coors lawsuit ===
In 1991, Energizer Holdings unsuccessfully sued the Adolph Coors Company for copyright and trademark infringement for creating a parody of its Energizer bunny ads.

The advertisement had comedian Leslie Nielsen banging a bass drum while wearing rabbit ears while the announcer said &quot;It keeps growing and growing!&quot; The court eventually sided with Coors noting the obvious facts that the content of the ad is substantially different considering Nielsen was not a toy and he did not run on batteries.

=== 2016 Duracell distribution lawsuit ===
In February 2016, Energizer filed a trademark infringement and contract violation lawsuit against Duracell. Energizer alleged that Duracell was using a pink bunny in its advertising in the United States, did not have any trademark rights in the United States in a pink bunny, and had violated an agreement between Energizer and Duracell governing the use of a pink bunny trademark in the U.S. Duracell replied that the cases Energizer cited came from overseas distributors importing packages from abroad, and that Duracell did not have the specific power to stop those distributors from doing so. In November 2017, a United States District court judge threw out most of Energizer&#x27;s claims in a summary judgement, but leaving the breach of the 1992 territorial contract dispute active with respect to the two companies&#x27; bunny trademarks.

<doc id="993280" wikidata="Q492312" url="?curid=993280" title="Hondarribia">
<text>Hondarribia (; ; ) is a Spanish town situated on the west shore of the Bidasoa river&#x27;s estuary, in Gipuzkoa, in the Basque Autonomous Community.

The border town is situated on a little promontory facing Hendaye (France) over the Txingudi bay. A service boat makes the trip between the two. The town has an ancient old quarter with walls and a castle. In addition, Hondarribia features a beach across the Bidasoa from the touristy housing estate &quot;Sokoburu&quot; in Hendaye, alongside a mountain called Jaizkibel providing a hilly backdrop to the town. A road leads northeast from the beach area to Cape Higuer, located in this municipality.

The town harbours the San Sebastian Airport, which serves domestic flights. The population as of 2005 is 15,700 inhabitants.

==Battles==
The battles fought for possession of this fortified stronghold are generally known by the Spanish name for the place (Fuenterrabía).
* Unsuccessful attempts to seize Hondarribia were made by French troops in 1476 and 1503.
*Battle of Fuenterrabía (1521), in which Claude, Duke of Guise distinguished himself, was instigated by Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet, in command of the army of Navarre; he occupied the stronghold after the renewal of hostilities. The city was finally reoccupied by Charles V&#x27;s forces in 1524 after the first Siege of Fuenterrabía.
*Siege of Fuenterrabía (1638) was the outcome of a siege by the invading forces of Louis XIII, led by Condé. 27,000 French soldiers besieged the city for two months, firing 16,000 shells into the walled city, leaving only 300 survivors, most of them women and children. The city was virtually destroyed, but nevertheless did not surrender. The Spanish soldiers were successful, and the raising of the siege is celebrated annually on 8 September in a parade, known as &quot;Alarde&quot;.
*Battle of Fuenterrabía (1719), during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, part of the campaign leading to the French Siege of San Sebastian
*Battle of Fuenterrabía (1794), in which the French Revolutionary Army took the city by breaching the walls. After they took over the city, they blew up with the help of German engineers the section of wall facing France. The signing of the Peace of Basel took place before all the wall was destroyed.

Although Milton, in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; associated the rout of Charlemagne in 778 with Fontarabia, it is generally understood to have taken place at Roncesvalles.

==Sports==
The women&#x27;s basketball team Hondarribia-Irun and the rowing club Hondarribia Arraun Elkartea are the two most prestigious sports clubs in the town. In the last decade, the judo club Ama Guadalupekoa has had a lot of national medals in this discipline.

The Hondarribia-Irun plays in the Spanish women&#x27;s basketball league since 2003, and it has competed against European teams several times.
Hondarribia has a rowing team called Hondarribia Arraun Elkartea, and its boat is characterized by its green color and its name, &quot;Ama Guadalupekoa&quot;. 
In 2005 it won La Bandera de la Concha, one of the most prestigious competitions for Basque rowers.

Furthermore, the Vilariño family, which is fully linked to the world of the engine, continues to achieve success at national and European levels.

Hondarribia has its own golf course where Jose Maria Olazabal, one of the best golf players in the world, was raised, and marina, where the Olympic medalist Iker Martinez took his first boat roads.

==Leisure==

* The construction of a jetty and other ancillary works by the engineer Iribarren, created the beach (hondartza) of Hondarribia that provides a place to enjoy the waters of the bay. In the late twentieth century the beach was partially modified, building on its surroundings a recreational port and a sports center.
* Throughout the year, but especially in the summer months, Arma Plaza Fundazioa (municipal foundation) organizes guided visits to the old town, the port-quarter of the Marina and the Fort of Guadalupe.
* The tourist office also managed by Arma Plaza Fundazioa, located in the Plaza de Armas, incorporates an interpretation center with spaces for audiovisual presentations / temporary exhibitions and souvenirs of the city.

==Notable residents==
* Juan de Alcega (16th century), mathematician and tailor known by his book on geometrical tailoring.
* Jorge Bolet, legendary American-Cuban pianist
* José María Olazábal famous Spanish golfer, winner of two U.S. Masters titles and regular member of the European Ryder Cup team.
* Unai Emery, manager of Aston Villa, winner of Europa League and the former manager of Villareal, Arsenal, Paris Saint Germain, Sevilla FC, Valencia CF and Spartak Moscow.
* Íñigo Cervantes, professional tennis player
* Itziar Mendizabal, ballet dancer
* Ander Vilariño, racing driver

<text>The General civil code ( or ABGB) is the Civil Code of Austria, which after about 40 years of preparatory work was published on 1 June 1811 and came into force on 1 January 1812. Karl Anton Freiherr von Martini and Franz von Zeiller were the leading drafters at the earlier and later stages of the draft. Comparable to the Napoleonic code, it was based on the ideals of freedom and equality before the law. It was divided into three major segments, following the Roman law segregation methods. It was modernized during the First World War. ABGB continues to be the basic civil code of Austria to this day and it is also still the basic civil code of Liechtenstein. The ABGB was widely received. Besides Austria, its influence persists in other successor states of Austria-Hungary. In the Czech part of Czechoslovakia (the Slovak part used Hungarian customary law) it was in effect until 1951, although it had been novelized multiple times, until it was replaced by the civil code from 1950. Despite fact that some parts were in effect until 1964, the civil code had never been translated and published in Czech. The new Czech civil code (2012) took its inspiration from the ABGB again. In southern Poland it was partially in effect until the end of 1946. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was partially introduced after 1878, and some parts are still in use, even after this country&#x27;s independence.

<text>Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd, operating as Tigerair, was a low-cost airline headquartered in Singapore. It operated services to regional destinations in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, Taiwan, China and India from its main base at Singapore Changi Airport. It was founded as an independent airline in 2003, and was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange under the Tiger Airways Holdings name in 2010. In October 2014, parent company Tiger Airways Holdings became a subsidiary of the SIA Group, who took a 56% ownership stake.

On 18 May 2016, Singapore Airlines established &quot;Budget Aviation Holdings&quot;, a holding company to own and manage its budget airlines Scoot and &quot;Tiger Airways&quot; following the delisting of Tiger Airways from the Singapore Stock Exchange. Tigerair merged with Scoot on 25 July 2017, retaining its air operator&#x27;s certificate while operating under the Scoot brand.

==History==
===Establishment===

Tiger Airways Singapore was incorporated on 12 December 2003 and began ticket sales on 31 August 2004. It has its head office in the Honeywell Building in Changi, Singapore.

Services commenced on 15 September 2004 to Bangkok. Scheduled international services are operated from Singapore Changi Airport. The airline is a subsidiary of Tiger Airways Holdings, a Singapore-based company.

In 2006, the airline flew 1.2 million passengers, a growth of 75% from the previous year.

The airline was the first to operate from the Budget Terminal at Changi Airport as part of its cost-saving operations structure, similar to Ryanair&#x27;s. Despite regional competition, the airline has reiterated its current intention to remain focused on flying within a five-hour radius from its Singaporean base.

As of 25 September 2012, Tigerair Singapore operates from Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2 due to the demolition of the Budget Terminal to make way for Terminal 4, completed in 2017.

===Route strategy===


The airline encountered a period of relative difficulty for the aviation industry with rising oil prices and intense competition from other airlines. The airline held off imposing fuel surcharges as its competitors had done.

With Singapore Airlines (SIA) having a stake in the airline, the airline occasionally fills in the gap when SIA drops its services from certain destinations. Macau, once served by SIA before being taken up by its subsidiary, SilkAir, in 2002, terminated all flights completely by the end of 2004. Three months later, the route was taken over by Tigerair with flights commencing 25 March 2005. A similar pattern can be observed in Krabi, where SilkAir suspended services in February 2005 in the wake of the effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Tigerair resumed direct services to the location on 7 October 2005.

In late July 2005, it was announced that the airline would commence flights from Macau to Manila (Clark) on 30 October 2005, a much-heralded move as it may signal the establishment of a secondary base besides Singapore, allowing the airline to expand and diversify risks.

On 21 September 2005, the company produced a report card on its first year of operations, with a total of over 500,000 passengers carried, 5000 scheduled flights flown, and a flight completion rate of 98.7 per cent. 94 per cent of flight departures and 90 per cent of arrivals took place according to schedule. It acquired four aircraft and launched a total of nine routes – of which four are flown exclusively by the airline – during the year.

The airline expected to increase its fleet to nine Airbus A320 aircraft by end-2006, and to carry up to three million passengers a year by then. It also hoped to add six more routes during the year, primarily to destinations in China and India, with flights to Southern China having commenced in April.

The airline also announced its switch from Singapore Airport Terminal Services to Swissport for ground handling once it became the first airline to operate at the newly opened Budget Terminal in Changi Airport on 26 March 2006.

Tigerair became the first Singaporean low-cost carrier to receive operating permits from the Chinese aviation authorities to fly to the southern Chinese cities of Haikou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen in an announcement on 21 February 2006. Ticket sales to these destinations commenced on 24 February 2006, with the first flight to Shenzhen taking place on 15 April, to Haikou from 26 April and to Guangzhou from 27 April 2006. The airline has since indicated that the routes were highly popular, with increased flights to Haikou and Guangzhou less than three months since their launch.

In June 2006, flights to Da Nang were suspended. On 20 July 2006, the media reported on the airline&#x27;s intentions to increase its routes from 15 to 20 and to establish a second base city by the end of the year. Possible growth regions included China, Southern India, Cambodia and Brunei.

The airline&#x27;s plan for a possible initial public offering was also revealed. At the same time, it announced that it saw an increase of 81 per cent in passengers carried in the months of April to June since its move to the Budget Terminal in March, compared to the same period in the previous year. Tigerair started services from Singapore to Perth on 23 March 2007.

On 25 October 2010, Tigerair announced that it would withdraw from Bangalore effective 14 November 2010, citing no reason. Tigerair resumed its flights between Singapore and Bangalore on 31 October 2011.

On 19 August 2015, Tigerair announced it was expanding its network with the addition of Quanzhou and Lucknow as new destinations, commencing services on 28 September and 3 December respectively.

=== Merging with Scoot ===
On 4 November 2016, the parent company of Tigerair, Singapore Airlines announced a merger of Tigerair and Scoot with Tigerair coming into the Scoot brand. It will allow both airlines to achieve synergies in fare costs and revenue and operate under the same Air operator&#x27;s certificate or AOC. Tigerair officially merged with Scoot and began operating under the Scoot brand on 25 July 2017, while the rebranding will leave the joint-venture Tigerair Australia and Tigerair Taiwan intact as Tigerair Australia 100% owned by Virgin Australia (Virgin Australia retains the Tigerair name and acquire the brand rights for Tigerair to operate to some international destinations from Australia.), while Tigerair Taiwan co-owned by China Airlines (80%) and its subsidiary Mandarin Airlines (10%) (with Tigerair hold 10%), respectively.

On 13 January 2022, Tigerair Taiwan bought &quot;Tigerair&quot; brand ownership from Tigerair, making the company the sole brand owner.

==Destinations==
At the time of its integration with Scoot, Tigerair flew from Singapore to 38 destinations. For merged network, see List of Scoot destinations.

===Codeshare agreements===
Tigerair had a codeshare agreement with:

* Golden Myanmar Airlines (suspended from 22 April 2015)

On 16 May 2016, Tigerair joined the world&#x27;s largest low-cost carrier alliance, Value Alliance. The new alliance was started with Philippines&#x27; Cebu Pacific, South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Air, Thailand&#x27;s Nok Air and NokScoot, Tigerair Singapore, Tigerair Australia and Japan&#x27;s Vanilla Air.

==Corporate management==
Tigerair&#x27;s original founding shareholders were Singapore Airlines (49%), Bill Franke&#x27;s Indigo Partners (24%); Tony Ryan&#x27;s Irelandia Investments (16%) and Temasek Holdings (11%).

Tigerair Singapore is wholly owned by Tiger Airways Holdings Limited, a holding company set up in 2007 to manage both Tiger Airways and start-up Australian subsidiary Tigerair Australia, which has since been disposed to Virgin Australia. Tiger Airways Holdings Limited is listed on SGX since 2010.

In October 2014, the Singapore Airlines group increased its stake to take a majority ownership in Tiger Airways Holdings, and according to the 2015 Annual Report Singapore Airlines Limited has a 56% ownership of the company:

In November 2015, Singapore Airlines announced an offer to acquire the remaining 44.23% stake in Tiger Airways Holdings Limited for $0.41 per share. This represents a $0.10 premium, or 32% more than the price before the takeover was announced. The offer was conditional upon Singapore Airlines owning more than 90% of Tiger Airways, however Singapore Airlines has since extended the offer until 8 January 2016, for it currently only owns 74.5% of Tigerair.

===Business trends===
The following table shows the business trends of Tigerair Singapore, excluding other Tigerair subsidiaries and associated airlines.

On 10 October 2007, Tigerair confirmed the letter of intent signed in June. The new aircraft will be deployed in Tigerair&#x27;s Asia-Pacific network and the domestic operations in Australia. On 18 December 2007, Tigerair announced that it had taken up the options and made further orders to take their fleet of Airbus A320s to 70 in total.

On 24 March 2014, Tigerair signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Airbus to purchase 37 Airbus A320neo aircraft with 13 options.

<doc id="993294" wikidata="Q2964581" url="?curid=993294" title="Chouchen">
<text>Chouchen (Breton: &quot;chouchenn&quot;) is an alcoholic beverage native to Brittany. A form of mead, it is made from the fermentation of honey in water. Chouchen normally contains 14% alcohol by volume. Traditionally, buckwheat honey is used, and this imparts chouchen&#x27;s strong colour and pronounced flavour.

In Brittany, the fermentation process is begun by the addition of freshly pressed apple juice. Yeasts can also be used, as in the beer-making process. To reach the required alcoholic strength, for a litre of chouchen, approximately a third of a litre of honey is needed.

Chouchen is drunk chilled (though without ice), and generally as an aperitif. It can also be added to melon, in a similar way to port wine, or as a hot wine in the winter. There are different kinds of chouchen in Brittany, some of which are prepared with a mixture of seawater as well as fresh water and honey.

Originally chouchen was made of cider and honey. The historical reputation of chouchen as a powerful intoxicant arises partly from claims that its effects were boosted by the venom of bees that became mixed up in the brew. Bees and their venom are not ingredients of the modern product.

There is another drink similar to chouchen, called chufere, which is made of honey and cider. It is generally of a lower strength in alcohol than chouchen, typically eight to nine percent alcohol by volume, and has become less popular and less common than chouchen.

<doc id="993301" wikidata="Q7870524" url="?curid=993301" title="USS Jefferson (1814)">
<text>USS &quot;Jefferson&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. She was named for Founding Father and third U.S. president Thomas Jefferson. &quot;Jefferson&quot; was built at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York, for service in Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s fleet on Lake Ontario and launched 7 April 1814. She was manned by a crew from sloop of war which had been laid up at Baltimore because of the British blockade of Chesapeake Bay. Comdr. Charles G. Ridgeley was her captain. Notable Master Gunner George Marshall a warrant officer, was responsible for the ship&#x27;s artillery. Marshall was also from the sloop of war .

Most of the guns for the new American ships had not reached Sackett&#x27;s Harbor by 19 May when the British fleet arrived off the American base and began a strict blockade. &quot;Jefferson&quot; finally sailed with Chauncey&#x27;s fleet on 31 July and arrived off Niagara on 5 August. Eleven days prior to the arrival of the USS Jefferson the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane occurred at Niagara Falls. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war, and one of the deadliest battles ever fought in Canada, 
The Siege of Fort Erie continued for a month.

With and the &quot;Jefferson&quot; set up a blockade while Chauncey with the rest of the fleet sailed on to Kingston to challenge the main English squadron. Several ships were blocked in the Niagara River. The blockade also prevented British supplies and troops from entering the Niagara River at the Lake Ontario entrance. Naval ships could not travel from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie because of Niagara Falls. British ships would use a portage road traveling 11 miles to naval ships closer to Lake Erie. The blockade stopped this crucial artery while the Siege of Fort Erie raged on aiding the United States. The crews of the vessels gained experience in amphibious warfare.

After remaining on blockade duty off Niagara for over a month, &quot;Jefferson&quot; sailed for Kingston to rejoin Chauncey. The ship crew also captured several small British vessels. During the passage, on 12 September, a severe storm arose, which before abating three days later, almost swamped the brig. Ten of her guns were thrown overboard in the struggle to save the ship.

&quot;Jefferson&quot; rejoined her fleet on 17 September and operated with it during the remainder of the navigation season attempting to draw Sir James Yeo&#x27;s ships into a decisive contest. Toward the end of November she was laid up for the winter.

Peace obviated &quot;Jefferson&quot;″s planned return to commission in the spring. She apparently remained in ordinary until sold on 30 April 1825.
