<text>Johannes Schefferus (February 2, 1621 – March 26, 1679) was one of the most important Swedish humanists of his time. He was also known as Angelus and is remembered for writing hymns.

Schefferus was born in Strasbourg, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. He came from the patrician family (Scheffer), studied at university there and briefly in Leiden, and was in 1648 made professor Skytteanus of eloquence and government at Uppsala University, a chair he held until his death in 1679.

Schefferus also spent time on philological and archaeological studies. His &quot;De orbibus tribus aureis&quot; became the first publication on Swedish archaeology. The story of the Sami people, &quot;Lapponia&quot; (1673) became popular around Europe but was not translated into Swedish (as &quot;Lappland&quot;) until 1956. His posthumous publication, &quot;Suecia literata&quot; (&quot;The Learned Sweden&quot;) (1680) is a Swedish history of science bibliography.

Schefferus was later in life involved in an intellectual dispute, particularly with Olof Verelius (1618–1682) over the location of the Temple at Uppsala. He argued that the temple should be found near the current location of &quot;Helga Trefaldighets kyrka&quot; (Church of the Holy Trinity) in Uppsala. It is today known that his opponents usually used forgery to meet his argumentation. This was presumably the reason that parts of the largest surviving Gothic text, Codex Argenteus, were retouched.

In 1648, Schefferus married Regina Loccenia, the daughter of a previous (1628–1642) professor skytteanus, Johannes Loccenius, and had two sons (see Scheffer).

<text>The Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean ( or &quot;&quot;) consist of four small coral islands, an atoll, as well as a reef in the Indian Ocean; they constitute the fifth district of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, though sovereignty over some or all of the islands is contested by the Comoros, Madagascar, and Mauritius. None of the islands have ever had a permanent population, though the French armed forces maintain small troop contingents on some of the islands.

Two of the islands—Europa Island and Juan de Nova Island—and the Bassas da India atoll lie in the Mozambique Channel west of Madagascar, while a third island, Tromelin Island, lies about east of Madagascar and the Glorioso Islands lies about northwest of Madagascar. Also in the Mozambique Channel is Banc du Geyser, a mostly submerged reef considered a part of the Glorioso Islands by France and the Comoros.

The islands have been classified as nature reserves. Except for Bassas da India, they all support meteorological stations: those on the Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova, and Europa Island are automated. The station on Tromelin Island, in particular, provides warning of cyclones threatening Madagascar, Mauritius, or Réunion. Each of the islands, except Banc du Geyser and Bassas da India, has an airstrip of more than .

== Overview ==
== Individual islands ==
*Bassas da India
**Ten unnamed rock islets
*Europa Island
**Île Europa
**Eight unnamed rock islets
*Glorioso Islands
**Banc du Geyser
**Grande Glorieuse
**Île du Lys
**South Rock
**Verte Rocks (three islets)
**Wreck Rock
**Three unnamed islets
*Juan de Nova Island
*Tromelin Island

== Administration ==
Since January 3, 2005, the Scattered Islands have been administered on behalf of the French state by the senior administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, based in Réunion. The Scattered Islands had previously been under the administration of the prefect of Réunion since the independence of Madagascar in 1960. France maintains a military garrison of around 14 troops on each of the islands in the Mozambique Channel that are claimed by Madagascar. The troops are supported by French naval vessels based in Réunion conducting patrol missions and re-supply operations about four times per year. The Glorioso Islands are also claimed by the Comoros, while Mauritius claims Tromelin Island.

France has an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 200 nautical miles around each of the small islands in the Scattered Islands, which together with the EEZ claims for the islands of Mayotte and Réunion totals more than one million square kilometres in the western Indian Ocean. There is considerable overlap of the EEZ with the neighbouring states.

== Sovereignty dispute ==
Mauritius, Madagascar, and the Comoros dispute France&#x27;s sovereignty over these islands. Mauritius claims Tromelin Island and states that the island, discovered by France in 1722, was not ceded by the Treaty of Paris in 1814. Madagascar claims sovereignty over the Glorioso Islands (including Banc du Geyser), though the island group was never a part of the Malagasy Protectorate, having been a part of the Colony of Mayotte and dependencies, then a part of the French Comoros that had become a separately administered colony from Madagascar in 1946. The Comoros also claims the Glorioso Islands (including Banc du Geyser), as a part of the disputed French region of Mayotte. Furthermore, Madagascar has also claimed Bassas da India, Europa Island, and Juan de Nova Island since 1972, and a 1979 United Nations resolution (without binding force) demanded the cession of these islands to Madagascar. Seychelles claimed a part of the Scattered Islands too before the signing of the France–Seychelles Maritime Boundary Agreement.

<doc id="995876" wikidata="Q1737562" url="?curid=995876" title="Kazuma Pan National Park">
<text>Kazuma Pan National Park is situated in Zimbabwe&#x27;s extreme north-western corner, lying on the Botswana border a short distance north-west of Hwange National Park. Some 77,345 acres (313 km2) in area, it provides one of Zimbabwe&#x27;s few areas of plains scenery, with good visibility and sparse but important mammal populations.

==Flora and fauna==

Kazuma Pan is virtually unspoilt wilderness with an open landscape of grassy plains which is reminiscent of the great East African plains and is thus dissimilar to the usual Zimbabwean bush or woodland landscapes. Within the Park there are a series of pans, some of which are kept continuously filled by water pumped from boreholes during the dry season. This permanent water source causes large concentrations of wildlife to seasonally migrate between Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially towards the end of the dry season from September through to the first rains of November or December.

Wildlife to be seen in Kazuma Pan National Park include lion, leopard, Southern giraffe, common zebra, gemsbok, roan antelope, sable antelope, tsessebe, common eland and Southern reedbuck. African elephant and Cape buffalo are present in large numbers towards the end of the dry season when water is scarce elsewhere. White rhinoceros can also be frequently seen. A special species to the Kazuma Pan National Park is the oribi, a small antelope, which is rather rare in Zimbabwe. Cheetah or African wild dog are still present though rare but lions are fairly common.

Much of the park consists of grassland, fringed by mopane and Kalahari sand woodlands. There are a series of seasonally flooded pans in the south-west of the park attracts a wide variety of waterfowl. The pan systems are also ideal habitat to a large variety of water birds, with a number of species including storks, crowned cranes, stilts, cormorants, ducks and kingfishers occurring throughout the area.

Kazuma Pan was proclaimed a National Park in 1949, but was deproclaimed in 1964 as no development had taken place. It regained its National Park status under the Parks and Wild Life Act (1975). There is no accommodation within the park but camping is allowed at two undeveloped camp sites, with permission from the Department of National Parks and Wild Life Management.

==Notes==
This park is considered for inclusion in the 5 Nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

<text>Manuel Pablo García Díaz (born 25 January 1976), known as Manuel Pablo, is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played mainly as a right-back. He is currently manager of Deportivo Fabril.

He spent most of his career with Deportivo, appearing in 482 official matches and notably winning the 1999–2000 La Liga. With stamina as his main asset, he also represented Spain on 13 occasions.

==Club career==
Born in Arucas, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Manuel Pablo was 22 when he joined Deportivo de La Coruña from his hometown club UD Las Palmas in summer 1998, being signed together with Argentine Turu Flores. He made his La Liga debut on 15 November 1998 in a 2–2 home draw against Deportivo Alavés, but faced serious competition from Armando Álvarez in his first season, appearing in just 14 league matches.

Manuel Pablo was a vital part of &quot;Depor&quot;&#x27;s defence as the Galician side were crowned national champions in 2000 for the only time in their history. He contributed 37 games to the feat, 45 in all competitions.

On 30 September 2001, Manuel Pablo sustained an horrific tibia injury during the televised Galician derby against RC Celta de Vigo after an unlucky tackle by Everton Giovanella. Subsequently, he missed the rest of the campaign.

Manuel Pablo returned one year later, playing the full 90 minutes against CD Corralejo in a Copa del Rey tie. On 6 October 2002 he was handed his league return by coach Javier Irureta, as a late substitute in the 0–2 home loss to Racing de Santander.

In 2003–04&#x27;s closing stages, Manuel Pablo proved he was fully recovered, as displayed in an excellent performance on 7 April 2004 in a 4–0 win over AC Milan in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League (5–4 aggregate victory). From the 2004–05 season onwards, he was the undisputed right-back at the Estadio Riazor (although he faced stiff competition from Álvaro Arbeloa in the 2006–07 campaign until the latter departed for Liverpool in January 2007).

In the following two seasons, Manuel Pablo remained first-choice at his position, although he was challenged by younger Laure in 2008–09. In early May 2009, following lengthy negotiations, the 33-year-old renewed his &quot;Depor&quot; contract in a 2+1 deal.

From 2009 to 2015, Manuel Pablo still managed to total 126 league games, being relegated twice from the top flight and achieving as many promotions. On 16 June 2015, he extended his link for a further year.

On 7 July 2016, after only five competitive appearances during the season, the 40-year-old Manuel Pablo retired. He continued to work with his main club after becoming a manager, as assistant to the B team and youth head coach.

Manuel Pablo was named head coach of Deportivo&#x27;s reserves on 5 November 2024.

==International career==
Manuel Pablo&#x27;s performances for Deportivo earned him a debut with the Spain national team on 16 August 2000, in a 4–1 away friendly defeat to Germany. He played for his country a further 12 times.

<text>Independencia () is a province of the Dominican Republic, located in the west, on the border with Haiti. Its capital is Jimani. The province was created in 1948 but was made official in 1950. Before its creation, it was part of the Baoruco Province. The name was given in remembrance of the National Independence of February 27, 1844.

== History ==
The province Independencia was founded in the lands that in previous times belonged to a Cacique called Ximani who was related to the cacicazgo of Xaragua. Little is known of Ximani as the ties with between the natives of Ximani and the Spanish were practically non-existent. The law that created this province, December 29, 1948, had originally assigned the name of &quot;Provincia de Jimaní&quot; to the province. The name was then changed January 28, 1949, to &quot;Provincia Nueva Era&quot;. The name was then finally changed to the present one, &quot;Independence&quot;, on May 13, 1949.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006, is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distritos municipales&quot; - D.M.) within the latter:
*Cristóbal
** Batey 8 (D.M.)
*Duvergé 
**Vengan a Ver (D.M.)
**Puerto Escondido (D.M.)
*Jimaní 
**Boca de Cachón (D.M.)
**El Limón (D.M.) 
*La Descubierta 
*Mella 
**La Colonia (D.M.)
*Postrer Río 
**Guayabal (D.M.)

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts, with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot;, literally &quot;heads&quot;) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot;, literally &quot;sections&quot;) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot;, literally &quot;places&quot;) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

<doc id="995896" wikidata="Q5305327" url="?curid=995896" title="Dragon of Wantley">
<text>The Dragon of Wantley is a legend of a dragon-slaying by a knight on Wharncliffe Crags in South Yorkshire, recounted in a comic broadside ballad of 1685. It was later included in Thomas Percy&#x27;s 1767 &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, enjoying widespread popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, although less well-known today. In 1737, the ballad was adapted (in English) into one of the more successful operas to appear in London up to that point.

The ballad tells of how a huge dragon - almost as big as the Trojan Horse - devours anything it wishes, even trees and buildings, until the Falstaffian knight Moore of Moore Hall obtains a bespoke suit of spiked Sheffield armour and delivers a fatal kick to the dragon&#x27;s &quot;arse-gut&quot; - its only vulnerable spot, as the dragon explains with its dying breath.

The topography of the ballad is accurate in its detail as regards Wharncliffe Crags and environs, but the story, and its burlesque humour, has been enjoyed in places far from the landscape from which it appears to derive and has been used to make a number of points unrelated to it.

==Inspirations==

More Hall is a 15th-century (or earlier) residence immediately below the gritstone edge of Wharncliffe Crags—Wharncliffe being formerly known in the local vernacular as Wantley—The dragon was reputed to reside in a den, and to fly across the valley to Allman (Dragon&#x27;s) Well on the Waldershelf ridge above Deepcar.

One member of the More family of More Hall, George More, was involved in the Throckmorton Plot against Elizabeth I in 1583.

===The 1573 case===
A lawsuit was taken out in 1573 by one George More of Sheffield on behalf of the Sheffield Burgery (the &#x27;free men&#x27; of Sheffield) against the Lord of the manor of Sheffield, George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, in respect of his appropriation of the proceeds of Sheffield &#x27;waste&#x27; land, which hitherto had paid for Sheffield&#x27;s poor, civic works and the parish church. This had long been the practice under an agreement in 1297 by one of Talbot&#x27;s predecessors, one Thomas Furnival, and had seemed secure after a successful petition some two decades previously to the newly enthroned Queen Mary with the full support of George Talbot&#x27;s father (the previous—fifth—Earl of Shrewsbury, Francis Talbot).

===Percy&#x27;s interpretation===

In his &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; Thomas Percy holds that the story of &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot; relates to a dispute over the alleged misappropriation of church tithes in Wharncliffe by Sir Francis Wortley who was opposed by a local lawyer named More.

==Opera parody==
Henry Carey wrote the libretto to a burlesque opera called &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot; in 1737. The opera, with music composed by John Frederick Lampe, punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Robert Walpole and his taxation policies. This Augustan parody was a huge success and its initial run was 69 performances in the first season; a number which exceeded even &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1728).

The opera debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that all the words were sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias. The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. &quot;The Musical Entertainer&quot; from 1739 contains engravings showing how the work was performed.

The piece is at once a satire of the ridiculousness of operatic staging and an indirect satire of the government&#x27;s tax policy. In Carey&#x27;s play, Moore of Moorehall, &quot;a valiant knight, in love with Margery&quot;, is a drunk who pauses to deal with the dragon only between bouts of drinking and carousing with women. Margery offers herself as a human sacrifice to Moore to persuade him to take on the cause of battling the dragon, and she is opposed by Mauxalinda, Moore&#x27;s &quot;cast-off mistress&quot;, who has interest in him now that a rival has appeared.

The battle with the dragon takes place entirely offstage, and Moore only wounds the dragon (who is more reasonable than Moore in his dialogue) in its anus. The main action concerns the lavish dances and songs by the two sopranos and Moore.

The opera is now rarely performed. Isleworth Baroque (now Richmond Opera) have produced two fully-staged productions, in 2012 and 2021. The University of Birmingham also performed the opera as part of their Summer Festival in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts. It is being produced for two performances in Chicago&#x27;s Haymarket Opera Company in October 2019 and the Boston Early Music Festival has announced performances in November 2023.

==The novel==
A novel, &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot;, was written by Owen Wister, best known as the author of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, in 1892. Wister described the story as a comic &quot;burlesque&quot; concerning the &quot;true&quot; story of the Dragon. It is a romantic story set at Christmastime in the early 13th century. The book was a surprise success, going through four editions over the next ten years.

==Representations==

There is a representation of the dragon above More Hall on the opposite side of the valley to Wharncliffe Crags. The snaking stone wall culminating in a carved dragon&#x27;s head can be found at the southern edge of Bitholmes Wood (Grid Ref:SK 295 959). There is also a bas-relief frieze of a knight killing a dragon, said to be a representation of More and the Dragon of Wantley, in the entrance hall to Sheffield Town Hall.

==Other references==
In his Chronicles of Barsetshire novels, Anthony Trollope names an inn and posting house in Barchester &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot;. When it is first mentioned, in &quot;The Warden&quot;, this pub is owned by John Bold, a local doctor, who is pursuing a dispute with the church authorities over the alleged misapplication of ecclesiastical revenues. The dragon is also mentioned in the first paragraph of the opening chapter of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel Ivanhoe where Scott writes &quot;In that pleasant district of Merry England which is watered by the River Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest...Here haunted of yore the fabulous Dragon of Wantley.&quot; In Chapter XXXVIII of David Copperfield, David writes a letter to Mr. Spenlow in which David &quot;addressed him...as if...he had been an Ogre, or the Dragon of Wantley.&quot; In Chapter III of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit, the children name trains after dragons, dubbing one &quot;the Worm of Wantley.&quot;

<text>The A590 is a trunk road in southern Cumbria, in the north-west of England. It runs north-east to south-west from M6 junction 36, through the towns of Ulverston and Barrow-in-Furness to terminate at Biggar Bank on Walney Island. The road is a mixture of dual carriageway and single carriageway, with the section east of Low Newton, Cumbria to the M6 being mainly dual. Further dual sections are south of Newby Bridge, south of Greenodd and south of Ulverston. The road is the main route for tourists entering the southern Lake District. It has often humorously been described as &quot;the longest cul-de-sac in the world&quot;.

==Route==

===M6 to Ulverston===

From east to west, the A590 originally terminated at the A6 road at Levens Bridge. Its route followed a number of country roads via a series of Turn Off To Stay On (TOTSO)s, passing through a number of villages including Lindale, High and Low Newton, Newby Bridge and Greenodd into the larger town of Ulverston. This road formed a large part of the southern boundary of the Lake District National Park upon its formation in 1951.

This stretch of road has now undergone a series of improvements and route alignments. In the mid-1970s, the A591 &#x27;Kendal link road&#x27; was built between Junction 36 of the M6 and Kendal with an extension of the A590 also being constructed to join this as part of the wider Lancashire expressways plans. This improvement to the A590 also included a realignment and dualling of the road to the west as far as High Newton, by-passing Lindale. In the mid-1990s the A590 was extended eastward through a re-numbering of the A591 between Sizergh and the M6, providing a single road between Barrow-in-Furness and the M6.

West of the Lindale bypass is the road&#x27;s most recent improvement, a 2.4-mile (3.8-kilometre) long stretch of dual carriageway built to bypass High and Low Newton at a cost of £35.3 million. This new stretch of road was constructed to a high environmental standard and achieved a CEEQUAL Award following its opening in Spring 2008. It connects to the original route to the east of Newby Bridge. The A590 reaches its most northern point at the foot of Windermere, before following the route of the River Leven to its estuary at Greenodd. Both the villages of Backbarrow and Greenodd have now been by-passed, though parts of this route remain narrow and winding. West of Greenodd the road switches between sections of single and dual carriageway.

===Ulverston-Walney Island===

The A590 passes through Ulverston, avoiding its most central streets, along an inner relief road. West of Ulverston the road is entirely single carriageway and is mainly used for commuting between Ulverston, Barrow-in-Furness and the small towns in-between the two. West of Dalton-in-Furness, the A590 follows an entirely different route to that it did prior to the early 1990s when Dalton was bypassed. Previously, the road had gone through Dalton and entered Barrow along the wide Victorian Abbey Road, before passing through Barrow&#x27;s shipyard onto Barrow Island.

Since 1992, the road has followed a modern bypass close to the South Lakes Safari Zoo and enters Barrow via its north-western industrial area, parallel to Walney Island passing the site of Barrow&#x27;s former iron and steelworks. A one way system opened in April 2008 now applies to the road as it passes closest to the centre of Barrow, with westbound traffic heading towards the town centre at Craven Park roundabout and eastbound traffic continuing through the industrial land alongside Walney Channel. The road continues westward over the Jubilee Bridge onto Walney Island and terminates at the Irish Sea

<doc id="995901" wikidata="Q2065658" url="?curid=995901" title="Strange (TV series)">
<text>Strange is a British television supernatural drama series, produced by the independent production company Big Bear Productions for the BBC, which aired on BBC One. It consists of a single one-hour pilot episode screened in March 2002, followed by a series of six one-hour episodes broadcast in the summer of 2003. The supernatural plot involved a defrocked priest&#x27;s mission to destroy demons.

==Plot==
The series follows former priest John Strange, dismissed from the clergy under mysterious circumstances. He was implicated in a number of gruesome murders, murders that he says were done by demons. Now he seeks those responsible and to clear his name. To help him in his hunt for demons, John has Toby, a technological expert who is in charge of the equipment John uses to sense the presence of demons, and Kevin. Kevin has Down&#x27;s syndrome, which appears to enable him to sense the presence of demons and is often an early warning that something supernatural is about to happen in the area. Jude, a former scientist who works as a nurse, is interested because she found out that her partner Rich was a demon. With Rich dead, her main concern is that the son they had together, Joey, could also be a demon. John&#x27;s mission is hampered by Canon Black, who is intent on denying the presence of dark forces.

==Setting==
The demons in &quot;Strange&quot; include non-human and near human forms. Near human demons are distinguishable by their inhuman eye colouring which varies from blood red, silver or gold. These demons are capable of concealing their eye colour with a sort of nictitating membrane which makes the eyes appear human. They are capable of interbreeding with humans and many such demons have assimilated themselves into human society to cover their activities.

Non-human demons live on the fringes of society or hibernate in isolated areas. They reputedly have long lifespans, and can only be killed through special methods. When a demon dies its body will explode in a ball of flame.

==Cast==
* Richard Coyle as John Strange
* Samantha Janus as Jude
* Ian Richardson as Canon Black
* Andrew-Lee Potts as Toby (Bryan Dick in the pilot)
* Timmy Lang as Kevin
* William Tomlin as Joey

==Production==
All six episodes of the series were written by Andrew Marshall, a scriptwriter primarily known for his comedy work. It was directed by Joe Ahearne, who had previously been responsible for both writing and directing the World Productions vampire serial &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; for Channel 4.

The six episodes were shot on location and at Ealing Studios, and filming concluded on 23 December 2002. Filming was split into two blocks; the first (made up of episodes 1, 2 and 5) was directed by Aherne and the second by Simon Massey, who had previously worked on &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;. Marshall wrote the first regular episode as an introduction to the characters and the scenario, despite having already done so for the pilot. He attributed this to the BBC&#x27;s policy of not repeating pilots; he had to introduce new viewers who may not have seen the pilot.

A second season was planned and Kevin was to have been found dead in the first episode.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast and reception==
Broadcast on Saturday nights, the series was hampered by frequent timeslot changes, the long gap between the pilot and the series and the BBC&#x27;s decision not to repeat the pilot before the series aired. The viewing figures were low, and a second series was not commissioned. However, to mark five years since the original broadcast, creator Andrew Marshall wrote an additional short story entitled &#x27;Ramset.&#x27;

In the United States, &quot;Strange&quot; has been broadcast by the cable television network Showtime, on one of its specialist subsidiary channels and in July 2009 the series started airing on Chiller. The UK Sci-Fi Channel screened all seven episodes of &quot;Strange&quot; in both 2006 and 2007.

<doc id="995903" wikidata="Q424997" url="?curid=995903" title="Mesna">
<text>Mesna, sold under the brand name Mesnex among others, is a medication used in those taking cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide to decrease the risk of bleeding from the bladder. It is used either by mouth or injection into a vein.
Common side effects include headache, vomiting, sleepiness, loss of appetite, cough, rash, and joint pain. Serious side effects include allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby but this use has not been well studied. Mesna is an organosulfur compound. It works by altering the breakdown products of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide found in the urine making them less toxic.
Mesna was approved for medical use in the United States in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical uses ==

=== Chemotherapy adjuvant ===

Mesna is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and haematuria when a patient receives ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide for cancer chemotherapy. These two anticancer agents, &quot;in vivo&quot;, may be converted to urotoxic metabolites, such as acrolein.

Mesna assists to detoxify these metabolites by reaction of its sulfhydryl group with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl containing compounds such as acrolein. This reaction is known as a Michael addition. Mesna also increases urinary excretion of cysteine.

=== Other ===

Outside North America, mesna is also used as a mucolytic agent, working in the same way as acetylcysteine; it is sold for this indication as Mistabron and Mistabronco.

== Administration ==

It is administered intravenously or orally (through the mouth). The IV mesna infusions would be given with IV ifosfamide, while oral mesna would be given with oral cyclophosphamide. The oral doses must be double the intravenous (IV) mesna dose due to bioavailability issues. The oral preparation allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, instead of staying four to five days for all the IV mesna infusions.

== Mechanism of action ==

Mesna reduces the toxicity of urotoxic compounds that may form after chemotherapy administration. Mesna is a water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties, and is given concomitantly with the chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Mesna concentrates in the bladder where acrolein accumulates after administration of chemotherapy and through a Michael addition, forms a conjugate with acrolein and other urotoxic metabolites. This conjugation reaction inactivates the urotoxic compounds to harmless metabolites. The metabolites are then excreted in the urine.

==Names==
It is marketed by Baxter as Uromitexan and Mesnex. The name of the substance is an acronym for 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate Na (&quot;Na&quot; being the chemical symbol for sodium).

<doc id="995905" wikidata="Q1323353" url="?curid=995905" title="La Altagracia Province">
<text>La Altagracia () is a province located in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic. It is the only region that borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It is divided into two municipalities and its capital is the beach city of Punta Cana. The province was part of the old La Altagracia Province, which split into two, La Altagracia Province and La Romana Province, on February 27, 1961.

The name &quot;La Altagracia&quot;&#x27; meaning the &quot;High Grace&quot; commemorates a painting, &quot;Our Lady of Altagracia&quot;, which was brought to this area from Spain in the early 16th century. Numerous miracles are attributed to the image.

Currently it is the leading province of the country in terms of tourism. This province is serviced by the Punta Cana International Airport, which is the most important airport on the island.

==History==

By 1505, Juan de Esquivel conquered the Taino chiefdom of Higuey and founded a fortress which he converted in 1506 by order of Ovando into a town, calling it Salvaleón de Higuey.

Years later, by Royal Privilege dispatched from Seville on December 7, 1508, this town was awarded the coat of arms. During the Spanish colonial period, Higüey remained as the Parish of the Seibo party. When the Republic was proclaimed in 1844, the Central Government Board designated it as a common part of the Department of El Seibo.

It was not until 1959, during the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, that the province of La Altagracia was officially created, occupying the eastern part of what belonged to the province of La Romana, which at that time was called Altagracia already for in 1945 when Higüey was elevated to a province under the name of Altagracia.

The Basílica Catedral Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia is located in Higüey and is one of the most important religious monuments in the Dominican Republic. It is the place of invocation of the Virgen de la Altagracia. The basilica was inaugurated on January 21, 1971, to replace the old sanctuary built in 1572. On October 12, 1970, it was declared a national monument. This basilica is a large structure in the shape of a Latin cross. The entrance door is made of gold-plated bronze and was blessed by Pope John Paul II in Rome. It has a bell tower with 45 bronze bells.

==Geography==
La Altagracia is the second largest province in the country with an extension of . This province limits to the north with the Atlantic Ocean, to the south with the Caribbean Sea, to the east with the Mona channel and to the west with the provinces of La Romana and El Seibo.

The most important river in the province is the Yuma, other rivers of consideration are in Duey, Maimon, Chavon, Anamuya, Sanate and Yonu. La Altagracia is part of the coastal plains of the Caribbean, so the southern part of the province presents a relatively flat relief in contrast to other regions of the country. Towards the north are the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera, where the Old Hill rises, which with its high is the highest in the province.

In the province there are three protected areas: the Eastern National Park, the Bávaro lagoon, and the Maimón lagoon. The National Park of the East (also known as Cotubanamá National Park) is the habitat of a varied terrestrial, marine and bird biodiversity, of which 112 species have been recorded, eight of which are endemic to the country and eleven to the Caribbean. Among the marine species native to this park are turtles, dolphins, and manatees. The park is located on a peninsula trapezoidal in shape and measures , also incorporating Saona Island. The park has hiking trails that connect to caves and springs.

The Bávaro lagoon is the habitat of the &quot;cyprinodon nichollsi&quot;, a fish that is in danger of extinction, and is a refuge for migratory ducks.

==Economy==

Tourism is one of the main economic activities in the province. It has first-class international hotel complexes, which places it in one of the main tourist destinations in the Caribbean and the entire Latin America region, which represent a very important source of income for the province, the destinations of Bávaro and Punta Cana being especially well known.

The province also has a notable economic activity based on extensive cattle ranching and agriculture. It is estimated that it has around 775,000 hectares of the province are dedicated to cattle ranching, which places it as the second province in the largest number of cattle. Agricultural activity comes hand in hand with the production of sugar cane and rice, as well as the production of corn, beans, and different foods such as cassava, plantain, yams and sweet potato. Fishing is also common on the coastal areas, not only as a traditional economic activity, but also as a tourist and sports activity.

==Population==
In the 2010 census, La Altagracia had a population of 273,210 inhabitants, of which 143,010 were men and 130,200 women. Of the total population, 77.8% of the people corresponded to the urban population and 22.2% to the rural population. The most populated city is Higüey with an urban population of 147,978 inhabitants, which represents 54.2% of the total in the province.

This province had an average annual growth rate in the 2002–2010 period of 5.1%, being the province with the highest growth in the country and being above the national growth rate, which was 1.2%. In the previous period (1993–2002), La Altagracia also had the highest population growth in the country.

In the 2022 census, La Altagracia had a population of 446,060 inhabitants, of which 222,866 were men and 223,194 women. Of the total population, 76.8% of the people corresponded to the urban population and 23.2% to the rural population. The most populated city is Higüey with an urban population of 327,886 inhabitants.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006, is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - M.D.) within them:
*Salvaleón de Higüey

<doc id="995908" wikidata="Q7820109" url="?curid=995908" title="Tomographic reconstruction">
<text>Tomographic reconstruction is a type of multidimensional inverse problem where the challenge is to yield an estimate of a specific system from a finite number of projections. The mathematical basis for tomographic imaging was laid down by Johann Radon. A notable example of applications is the reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) where cross-sectional images of patients are obtained in non-invasive manner. Recent developments have seen the Radon transform and its inverse used for tasks related to realistic object insertion required for testing and evaluating computed tomography use in airport security.

This article applies in general to reconstruction methods for all kinds of tomography, but some of the terms and physical descriptions refer directly to the reconstruction of X-ray computed tomography.

==Introducing formula==
The projection of an object, resulting from the tomographic measurement process at a given angle formula_1, is made up of a set of line integrals (see Fig. 1). A set of many such projections under different angles organized in 2D is called a sinogram (see Fig. 3). In X-ray CT, the line integral represents the total attenuation of the beam of X-rays as it travels in a straight line through the object. As mentioned above, the resulting image is a 2D (or 3D) model of the attenuation coefficient. That is, we wish to find the image formula_2. The simplest and easiest way to visualise the method of scanning is the system of parallel projection, as used in the first scanners. For this discussion we consider the data to be collected as a series of parallel rays, at position formula_3, across a projection at angle formula_1. This is repeated for various angles. Attenuation occurs exponentially in tissue:
:formula_5

where formula_2 is the attenuation coefficient as a function of position. Therefore, generally the total attenuation formula_7 of a ray at position formula_3, on the projection at angle formula_1, is given by the line integral:
:formula_10

Using the coordinate system of Figure 1, the value of formula_3 onto which the point formula_12 will be projected at angle formula_1 is given by:
:formula_14

So the equation above can be rewritten as
:formula_15

where formula_16 represents formula_2 and formula_18 is the Dirac delta function. This function is known as the Radon transform (or &quot;sinogram&quot;) of the 2D object.

The Fourier Transform of the projection can be written as

:formula_19 where formula_20

:formula_21 represents a slice of the 2D Fourier transform of formula_16 at angle formula_1. Using the inverse Fourier transform, the inverse Radon transform formula can be easily derived.
:formula_24

where formula_25 is the derivative of the Hilbert transform of formula_26

In theory, the inverse Radon transformation would yield the original image. The projection-slice theorem tells us that if we had an infinite number of one-dimensional projections of an object taken at an infinite number of angles, we could perfectly reconstruct the original object, formula_16. However, there will only be a finite number of projections available in practice.

Assuming formula_16 has effective diameter formula_29 and desired resolution is formula_30, a rule of thumb for the number of projections needed for reconstruction is formula_31

==Reconstruction algorithms==
Practical reconstruction algorithms have been developed to implement the process of reconstruction of a three-dimensional object from its projections. These algorithms are designed largely based on the mathematics of the X-ray transform, statistical knowledge of the data acquisition process and geometry of the data imaging system.

===Fourier-domain reconstruction algorithm===
Reconstruction can be made using interpolation. Assume formula_32 projections of formula_16 are generated at equally spaced angles, each sampled at the same rate. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on each projection yields sampling in the frequency domain. Combining all the frequency-sampled projections generates a polar raster in the frequency domain. The polar raster is sparse, so interpolation is used to fill the unknown DFT points, and reconstruction can be done through the inverse discrete Fourier transform. Reconstruction performance may improve by designing methods to change the sparsity of the polar raster, facilitating the effectiveness of interpolation.

For instance, a concentric square raster in the frequency domain can be obtained by changing the angle between each projection as follow:
:formula_34

where formula_35 is highest frequency to be evaluated.

The concentric square raster improves computational efficiency by allowing all the interpolation positions to be on rectangular DFT lattice. Furthermore, it reduces the interpolation error. Yet, the Fourier-Transform algorithm has a disadvantage of producing inherently noisy output.

===Back projection algorithm===
In practice of tomographic image reconstruction, often a stabilized and discretized version of the inverse Radon transform is used, known as the filtered back projection algorithm.

With a sampled discrete system, the inverse Radon transform is
:formula_36
:formula_37

where formula_38 is the angular spacing between the projections and formula_39 is a Radon kernel with frequency response formula_40.

The name &quot;back-projection&quot; comes from the fact that a one-dimensional projection needs to be filtered by a one-dimensional Radon kernel (back-projected) in order to obtain a two-dimensional signal. The filter used does not contain DC gain, so adding DC bias may be desirable. Reconstruction using back-projection allows better resolution than interpolation method described above. However, it induces greater noise because the filter is prone to amplify high-frequency content.

===Iterative reconstruction algorithm===

The iterative algorithm is computationally intensive but it allows the inclusion of &quot;a priori&quot; information about the system formula_16.

Let formula_32 be the number of projections and formula_43 be the distortion operator for the formula_44th projection taken at an angle formula_45. formula_46 are a set of parameters to optimize the conversion of iterations.
:formula_47

:formula_48

An alternative family of recursive tomographic reconstruction algorithms are the algebraic reconstruction techniques and iterative sparse asymptotic minimum variance.

===Fan-beam reconstruction===
Use of a noncollimated fan beam is common since a collimated beam of radiation is difficult to obtain. Fan beams will generate series of line integrals, not parallel to each other, as projections. The fan-beam system requires a 360-degree range of angles, which imposes mechanical constraints, but it allows faster signal acquisition time, which may be advantageous in certain settings such as in the field of medicine. Back projection follows a similar two-step procedure that yields reconstruction by computing weighted sum back-projections obtained from filtered projections.

===Deep learning reconstruction===

Deep learning methods are widely applied to image reconstruction nowadays and have achieved impressive results in various image reconstruction tasks, including low-dose denoising, sparse-view reconstruction, limited angle tomography and metal artifact reduction. An excellent overview can be found in the special issue of IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging. One group of deep learning reconstruction algorithms apply post-processing neural networks to achieve image-to-image reconstruction, where input images are reconstructed by conventional reconstruction methods. Artifact reduction using the U-Net in limited angle tomography is such an example application. However, incorrect structures may occur in an image reconstructed by such a completely data-driven method, as displayed in the figure. Therefore, integration of known operators into the architecture design of neural networks appears beneficial, as described in the concept of precision learning. For example, direct image reconstruction from projection data can be learnt from the framework of filtered back-projection. Another example is to build neural networks by unrolling iterative reconstruction algorithms. Except for precision learning, using conventional reconstruction methods with deep learning reconstruction prior is also an alternative approach to improve the image quality of deep learning reconstruction.

==Tomographic reconstruction software==

Tomographic systems have significant variability in their applications and geometries (locations of sources and detectors). This variability creates the need for very specific, tailored implementations of the processing and reconstruction algorithms. Thus, most CT manufacturers provide their own custom proprietary software. This is done not only to protect intellectual property, but may also be enforced by a government regulatory agency. Regardless, there are a number of general purpose tomographic reconstruction software packages that have been developed over the last couple decades, both commercial and open-source.

Most of the commercial software packages that are available for purchase focus on processing data for benchtop cone-beam CT systems. A few of these software packages include Volume Graphics, InstaRecon, iTomography, Livermore Tomography Tools (LTT), and Cone Beam Software Tools (CST).

Some noteworthy examples of open-source reconstruction software include: Reconstruction Toolkit (RTK), CONRAD, TomoPy, the ASTRA toolbox, PYRO-NN, ODL, TIGRE, and LEAP.

<text>The Calhoun Mine is perhaps the oldest and best-known mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia. When gold was discovered in Lumpkin County in 1828, which led to the Georgia Gold Rush in 1829, it was discovered on owned by Robert Obar. After at least two intermediary sales, the land was purchased by Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who later served as the 7th Vice President of the United States. Calhoun started a mining company to mine the land and later allowed his son-in-law Thomas Green Clemson, the founder of Clemson University, to manage it. The ore deposit was a very rich deposit and, according to an 1856 letter from Clemson to his brother-in-law, was still producing significant quantities of gold nearly 30 years after its initial discovery on the land. This mine - along with the Consolidated Mine and the Loud Mine - were some of the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt.

In 1879, the Calhoun Mine passed from the Calhoun family. In 1939, after the deposits at the Calhoun Mine were long thought to be depleted, a small pocket was discovered and mined. After the initial excitement, things became quiet once again at the mine. The Calhoun Mine was added to the National Register of Historic Places and named a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

Calhoun Mine is located about 3 miles (5 km) south of Dahlonega off State Route 60 and on the eastern side of the Chestatee River. It lies on a hill on the west side of the road - about 0.6 miles (1 km) off the road - on the opposite side of the ridge, on private property.

The mine was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, for its nationally significant role as an instigating element of the Cherokee removal. The mine was located directly adjacent to Cherokee land, and the conflict with miners illegally working Cherokee lands contributed to calls for removal, and the eventual displacement of, the Cherokee from their lands.

<doc id="995919" wikidata="Q1140742" url="?curid=995919" title="La Romana Province, Dominican Republic">
<text>La Romana () is a province of the Dominican Republic. The capital is also named La Romana, and is the third-largest city in the country. La Romana was elevated to the category of province in 1944. La Romana is also home to &quot;Casa de Campo&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s largest resorts and top golfing destinations, including the Teeth of the Dog golf course. Many international and local artists perform at &quot;Altos de Chavón&quot;, an artistic community and university.

La Romana is a port city ranked as Dominican Republic&#x27;s seventh-largest by population (around 130,000, metro around 215,000). The city is located opposite Catalina Island, and approximately from the national capital, Santo Domingo. Its name comes from a balance used to weigh merchandise for export. The province&#x27;s patron saint is Rose of Lima.

==History==
The province was created on January 1, 1961 after the older province of La Altagracia province was separated into two, whose capital was the city of La Romana, in the Province of La Romana and the new Province of La Altagracia. The political division of this province is one of the least complex in the country. It is made up of three municipalities: La Romana, Guaymate and Villa Hermosa (created as a municipality in 2004) and with the municipal districts of Caleta and Cumayasa. La Romana is the main municipality.

==Location==
The province borders to the north with the province of El Seibo, to the east with the province of La Altagracia, to the south with the Caribbean Sea and to the west with the province of San Pedro de Macorís. The province is part of the eastern Yuma region. La Romana is the third smallest province in the country, with and occupies 1.3% of the national territory. The main rivers are Cumayasa, La Romana (or Río Dulce), and Chavón.

==Economy==
La Romana&#x27;s economy is based mainly on the sugar industry, free zones and tourism. In La Romana there are still what is called &quot;bateyes&quot;, this is due to the great production of sugar cane. The bateyes are colonies of braceros, located in a suitable place for the handling of the agricultural work of the sugar cane. The main agricultural activity is the production of sugar cane followed by cattle raising, both milk and meat. In terms of industries, the main one is the production of sugar. In these places there are houses and facilities for agricultural activities. The sugar industry is the largest private employer in the country, with 25,000 workers including workers and office personnel. 

Tourism is of the utmost importance with its beaches, hotels, restaurants, giftshop, and places of entertainment. Tourist attractions generate income for the province and many jobs for the people who live in La Romana. The Central Romana company is an Agro-Industrial, tourist company and works in free zones; it employs more than 25,000 people. 56% of the tourist infrastructures in the city of La Romana have been built by the private sector with the help of the Central Bank, generating more jobs and contributing to the development of the province. This infrastructure has performed the functions for which they have been created, serving as a means of transport and allowing them to travel to the desired destination in the case of constructions, they have been manufactured with high quality materials to guarantee the durability and safety of these works.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:
*Guaymate
*La Romana 
**La Caleta (D.M.)
*Villa Hermosa 
**Cumayasa (D.M.) 

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities with population figures as of an estimate on the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

<text>The Miami metropolitan area is a coastal metropolitan area in southeastern Florida. It is the ninth-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States, and the largest metropolitan area in Florida. It is also known as [[South Florida]], SoFlo, SoFla, the Gold Coast, Southeast Florida, the Tri-County Area, or Greater Miami, and officially as the Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a population of 6.18 million, its population exceeds 31 of the nation&#x27;s 50 states as of 2023. It comprises the three most populated counties in the state, Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County, which rank as the first, second, and third-most populous counties in the state, respectively. Miami-Dade County, with 2,701,767 people in 2020, is the seventh-most populous county in the United States.

Miami is the region&#x27;s financial and cultural core and most populous city. Other principal cities, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, include Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Pompano Beach, Boca Raton, Sunrise, Deerfield Beach, Miami Beach, Kendall, Doral, Delray Beach, Jupiter, and Palm Beach Gardens. The Miami metropolitan area is part of the larger South Florida region of the state, which also includes the Everglades and the Florida Keys.

With of urban landmass, the Miami metropolitan area also is one of the world&#x27;s most populous urban agglomerations.

South Florida is largely confined to a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Everglades, and Miami&#x27;s urbanized area is about long (north to south) and at most east to west; in some areas, its east to west width is only . The Miami metropolitan statistical area is the second-longest urbanized area in the United States behind the New York metropolitan area. It was the eighth-most densely populated urbanized area in the United States as of the 2000 census.

As of the 2020 census, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale urbanized area had a land area of , with a population of 6,077,522, for a population density of .

The most notable colleges and universities in the Miami metropolitan area include Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami. The region also has three community colleges, Broward College, Miami Dade College, and Palm Beach State College. Some of these institutions, such as Florida International University and Miami Dade College, make up some of the largest institutions of higher learning in the United States.

==Other names==
The Miami metropolitan area is also known as South Florida, SoFlo, SoFla, the Gold Coast, the Tri-County Area, or Greater Miami, and, for U.S. government statistical purposes, the Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Definitions==
===Miami metropolitan area===

, the Miami metropolitan area is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), with a 2020 population of 6,138,333. The MSA is made up of three &quot;metropolitan divisions&quot; :
* Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Miami Dade County (2020 population 2,701,767).
* Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Sunrise Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Broward County (2020 population 1,944,375).
* West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Palm Beach County (2020 population 1,492,191).

The MSA is the second most populous metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States and has an area of 6,137 sq. mi (15,890 km2).

The original MSA for Miami, as defined by the OMB, included only Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). By 1995, the Miami-Hialeah and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood-Pompano Beach MSAs had been merged into the Miami-Fort Lauderdale Consolidated MSA, consisting of the Miami Primary MSA (Dade County) and the Fort Lauderdale Primary MSA (Broward County). In 2003, the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach MSA was merged with the consolidated MSA to form the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Miami Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area, consisting of: the Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deefield Beach Metropolitan Division (Broward County), the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall Metropolitan Division (Miami-Dade County), and the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach Metropolitan Division (Palm Beach County).

===Miami-Port Saint Lucie-Fort Lauderdale Combined Statistical Area===
The Census Bureau also defines a wider commercial region based on commuting patterns, the Miami-Port Saint Lucie-Fort Lauderdale Combined Statistical Area (CSA), with a population of 6,887,655 in 2020.

, the CSA consists of three component metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and one Micropolitan statistical area (μSA):
* The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach MSA (2020 pop. 6,138,333)
* The Port Saint Lucie MSA (2020 pop. 486,660), consisting of:
** Martin County (2020 pop. 158,431)p. 28
** Saint Lucie County (2020 pop. 329,226)p. 28
* The Sebastian-Vero Beach-West Vero Corridor MSA, coterminous with Indian River County (2020 pop. 159,788)
* The Key West-Key Largo μSA, coterminous with Monroe County (2020 pop. 82,874).
* The Okeechobee μSA, coterminous with Okeechobee County.

When the CSA was defined in 2013, it included the Okeechobee μSA, but not the Key West μSA. In 2018 the Okeechobee μSA was removed from the CSA and the Key West μSA was added. The Okeechobee μSA was re-added to the CSA in 2023.

=== Gold Coast ===
The Miami metropolitan area is frequently named the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; in convention with Florida&#x27;s other coast regions, including the Space Coast, Treasure Coast, Sun Coast, Nature Coast, Forgotten Coast, Emerald Coast, Fun Coast, and First Coast. Like several of the others, it seems to have originated at the time the area first saw major growth. One of the best known of Florida&#x27;s vernacular regions, the name is a reference to the wealth and ritzy tropical lifestyle that characterizes the area.

==Climate and geography==
===Climate===

The region has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is the only metropolitan area in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification, &quot;Am&quot;). The South Florida metropolis sees most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is quite dry in the winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when daily thunderstorms and passing weak tropical lows bring downpours during the late afternoon. The dry season often starts in late October and runs through late April. During the height of the dry season from February through April, South Florida is often very dry, and often brush fires and water restrictions are an issue. At times cold fronts can make it all the way down to South Florida and provide some modest rainfall in the dry season. The hurricane season largely coincides with the wet season.

In addition to its sea-level elevation, coastal location and position near the Tropic of Cancer and the Caribbean, the area owes its warm, humid climate to the Gulf Stream, which moderates climate year-round. A typical summer day does not see temperatures below . Temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s (30–35 °C) accompanied by high humidity are often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, although conditions still remain very muggy.

During winter, dry air often dominates as dew points are often very low. Average daily high temperatures across South Florida during the winter are around . Although daily highs can sometimes reach even in January and February. Daily low temperatures during the winter are generally around . Each winter, cold fronts occasionally make their way down to the northern Bahamas and South Florida. As a result, daytime high temperatures in South Florida may only reach around or cooler. When this occurs low temperatures can dip into the 40s during the early morning hours before quickly warming-up toward late morning/early afternoon. It is rare for temperatures to drop below , however, low temperatures at or around have occurred some years. South Florida only experiences these cold spells about twice each winter and they typically only last a day or two before temperatures return to the mid 70s. On average South Florida is frost-free, although there can be a light frost in the inland communities about once every decade.

Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop outside that period. The most likely time for South Florida to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season, mid-August through the end of September. Due to its location between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity, South Florida is also statistically the most likely major area to be struck by a hurricane in the world, trailed closely by Nassau, Bahamas, and Havana, Cuba. Many hurricanes have affected the metropolis, including Betsy in 1965, Andrew in 1992, Irene in 1999, Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005, and Irma in 2017. In addition, a tropical depression in October 2000 passed over the city, causing record rainfall and flooding. Locally, the storm is credited as the No Name Storm of 2000, though the depression went on to become Tropical Storm Leslie upon entering the Atlantic Ocean.

== Demographics ==


There is a strong divide between the northern and southern parts of the region in terms of dominant language. In 2010, English was the household language of 73.1% of Palm Beach County residents and 63.4% of Broward County residents but only 28.1% of Miami-Dade County residents. In contrast, 63.8% of Miami-Dade County residents spoke Spanish at home.

=== Religion ===
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalent religion in the Miami metropolitan area (68%), with 39% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant and 27% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. Judaism is second (9%), followed by Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and a variety of other religions have smaller followings; 21% of the population did not identify with any religion.

The Miami area has one of the largest Jewish communities in the United States. 10.2% of the population identified as Jewish in the 2000 Census. According to a 2011 survey of American Judaism, Palm Beach County had the most Jews of any Florida county both in absolute numbers (205,850) and as a percentage of the overall population (15.8%). Broward County came in second place with 170,700 Jewish residents or 9.8% of the population, and Miami-Dade County came in third with 106,300 or 4.3%.

===Housing===
Changes in house prices for the area are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the Case–Shiller index; the statistic is published by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and is also a component of S&amp;P&#x27;s 10-city composite index of the value of the residential real estate market.

As of 2005, the Miami area had a total of 2.3 million housing units, 13% of which were vacant. Of the total housing units, 52% were in single-unit structures, 45% were in multi-unit structures, and 3% were mobile homes. 25% of the housing units were built since 1990. As of 2019, over 70% of Miami&#x27;s residents are renters with median rent of $1,355, $180 over the national average.

Households and families: There were 2,338,450 households, The average household size was 2.6 people. Families made up 65% of the households in the Miami area. This figure includes both married-couple families (45%) and other families (20%). Nonfamily households made up 35% of all households in Miami. Most of the nonfamily households were people living alone, but some consisted of people living in households in which no one was related to the householder.

Occupied housing unit characteristics: In 2005, the Miami area had 2.0 million occupied housing units – 1.3 million (66%) owner occupied and 688,000 (34%) renter occupied.

As of 2010, housing costs in the Miami area typically represented 40% of household income, compared to 34% nationwide.

Property tax increase: In March 2009, Miami area lawmakers passed a 5–10% hike in property tax millage rates throughout the metropolitan area to fund the construction of new schools and to fund understaffed schools and educational institutions, resulting in an increase in residents&#x27; property tax bills beginning in the 2009 tax year.

==Politics==

Politically, metropolitan Miami is strongly Democratic, like most large metropolitan regions in the United States. Broward County is the second-most heavily Democratic county in the state, behind only Gadsden County, which is much smaller. This contrasts with most of the rest of Florida, whose heavier Southern influence and high population of elderly voters makes it a swing or Republican-leaning state. Miami-Dade County has a relatively high percentage of Republican voters for an urban county, due partially to its Cuban-American population, which leans Republican as a result of its anti-communist views, but Miami-Dade County still remains very Democratic when compared with most of Florida&#x27;s other counties. Despite being more suburban and affluent, Palm Beach County is reliably Democratic as well and in the 2020 presidential election voted for Democratic candidate Joe Biden by a higher margin than Miami-Dade County did.

In the 2016 presidential election, 62.3% of voters in the Miami metropolitan area voted Democratic. This was the 6th highest of any metro area in the United States. However, in recent years the area has shifted hard to the Republicans, with former president Donald Trump losing the metro area by 16 points in 2020 compared to losing it by 30 in 2016 (Fueled especially by Miami Dade County shifting 22 points to the right between 2016 and 2020), and Governor Ron DeSantis winning the metro area outright in the 2022 gubernatorial election, winning both Miami Dade and Palm Beach Counties (With the former being won by double digits) while losing Broward only by less than 16 points.

===Government===
The metropolitan area is governed by 3 counties. In total there are 107 municipalities or incorporated places in the metropolis. Each one of the municipalities has its own city, town or village government, although there is no distinction between the 3 names. Much of the land in the metropolis is unincorporated, which means it does not belong to any municipality, and therefore is governed directly by the county it is located in.

==Culture==
=== Miami dialect ===

In Miami-Dade County a unique dialect, commonly called the Miami dialect, is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- or third-generation Hispanics, including Cuban-Americans, whose first language was English, though some non-Hispanic white, black, and other races who were born and raised in Miami-Dade tend to adopt it as well. It is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic, especially the New York area dialect, Northern New Jersey English, and New York Latino English. Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect of the Miami accent is rhotic; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish in which rhythm is syllable-timed.

It is possible to differentiate the Miami accent from a variety of interlanguages spoken by second-language speakers. The Miami accent does not generally display addition of before initial consonant clusters with , speakers do not confuse of with , (e.g., &quot;Yale&quot; with &quot;jail&quot;), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [] instead of alveolar tap [] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.

The Miami accent is much less common in Broward County and Palm Beach County, where the majority of the population is non-Hispanic.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===
The Miami metropolitan area is served by five interstate highways operated by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in conjunction with local agencies. Interstate 95 (I-95) runs north to south along the coast, ending just south of Downtown Miami at South Dixie Highway (US 1). I-75 runs east to west, turning south in western Broward County and connecting suburban north Miami-Dade to Naples on the Southwest Coast via Alligator Alley, which transverses the Florida Everglades before turning north. I-595 connects the Broward coast and Downtown Fort Lauderdale to I-75 and Alligator Alley. In Miami, I-195 and I-395 relay the main I-95 route east to Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) and Miami Beach across Biscayne Bay via the Julia Tuttle and MacArthur causeways.

In greater Miami, the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) maintain eight state expressways in conjunction with FDOT. The Airport Expressway (SR 112) and the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836) relay western Miami-Dade suburbs to the eastern urban coast at I-95, and to Miami Beach via I-195 and I-395 at the Airport and Midtown interchanges. The Gratigny Parkway (SR 924) connects northern Miami suburbs to the southern end of I-75. The Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) is the primary beltway road of urban Miami, relaying I-95 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (SR 91) at the Golden Glades Interchange near northeastern North Miami Beach to the southern inland suburbs of Kendall and Pinecrest. The Don Shula Expressway (SR 874) and the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (SR 821) form the southernmost end of the beltway, connecting the Palmetto Expressway to the bedroom communities of Homestead and Florida City. The Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878) relays the Don Shula Expressway to South Dixie Highway (US 1).

The urban bypass expressway in greater Fort Lauderdale is the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869), connecting the northern Broward County coast at I-95 and Deerfield Beach to I-595 and I-75 at Alligator Alley in Sunrise.

Express lanes on I-95 start in Miami-Dade County and continue into Broward County. With an increased presence of traffic in South Florida, express lanes have been implemented in southern Palm Beach County.

=== Seaports ===

The metropolis also has four seaports, the largest and most important being the Port of Miami. Others in the area include Port Everglades, Port of Palm Beach and the Miami River Port. On August 21, 2012, PortMiami and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers signed the Partnership Agreement (PPA) construction agreement that will allow the Deep Dredge project to go out for bid. The Deep Dredge will deepen the Port&#x27;s existing channels to minus 50/52 feet to prepare for the Panama Canal expansion, now scheduled for completion in early 2015. PortMiami&#x27;s deeper channel will provide ships with an economically efficient, reliable and safe navigational route into the Port. PortMiami will be the only U.S. Port south of Norfolk, Virginia to be at the minus 50 foot depth in sync with the opening of the expanded Canal. Deep Dredge is expected to create more than 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in Florida and allow the Port to meet its goal to double its cargo traffic over the next decade.

<text>Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau (19 February 1846 – 15 February 1923) was a noted French Orientalist and archaeologist.

==Biography==
Clermont-Ganneau was born in Paris, the son of Simon Ganneau, a sculptor and mystic who died in 1851 when Clermont-Ganneau was five, after which Théophile Gautier took him under his wing. After an education at the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales, he entered the diplomatic service as &quot;dragoman&quot; to the consulate at Jerusalem, and afterwards at Constantinople. He laid the foundation of his reputation by his involvement with the Mesha Stele (Moabite Stone), which bears the oldest Semitic inscription known.

In 1871, Clermont-Ganneau identified the biblical city of Gezer with that of Abu Shusha, formerly known as &quot;Tell el Jezer&quot;. In the same year he discovered the Temple Warning inscription in Jerusalem. In 1874 he was employed by the British government to take charge of an archaeological expedition to Palestine. Among his discoveries there was the rock-cut tomb of the Biblical Shebna. He explored/discovered many tombs in Wady Yasul, a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which he claimed served as an auxiliary cemetery for Jerusalem at some ancient . Based on geographic and linguistic evidence he theorized that this valley was Azal mentioned in Zechariah 14:5 in the Bible. He was the first to make archeological soundings at Emmaus-Nicopolis. He was subsequently entrusted by his own government with similar missions to Syria and the Red Sea. He was made &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Legion of Honour in 1875. After serving as vice-consul at Jaffa from 1880 to 1882, he returned to Paris as &quot;secrétaire interpréte&quot; for oriental languages, and in 1886 was appointed consul of the first class. He subsequently accepted the post of director of the École des Langues Orientales and professor at the Collège de France.

In 1889 he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, of which he had been a correspondent since 1880. In 1896 he was promoted to be consul-general, and was minister plenipotentiary in 1906.

===Crusades against archaeological forgeries===
In 1873, after the Jerusalem antiquities dealer Moses Wilhelm Shapira offered a set of Moabite artifacts (known as the &quot;Shapira Collection&quot;) for sale, Clermont-Ganneau attacked the collection as a forgery. In 1883, Shapira offered the so-called &quot;Shapira Strips,&quot; fragments of ancient parchment allegedly found near the Dead Sea, for sale to the British Museum, which exhibited two of the strips. Clermont-Ganneau attended the exhibition, and was the first person in England to attack their authenticity. In 1903 he took a prominent part in the investigation of the so-called Tiara of Saitaferne. This tiara had been purchased by the Louvre for 200,000 francs, and exhibited as a genuine antique. Much discussion arose as to the perpetrators of the fraud, some believing that it came from southern Russia. It was agreed, however, that the whole object, except perhaps the band round the tiara, was of modern manufacture.

==Works==
Clermont-Ganneau&#x27;s chief publications, besides a number of contributions to journals, were:
*&quot;Palestine inconnue&quot; (Paris: Leroux, 1876)
* &quot;Mythologie Iconographique&quot; (Paris: Leroux,1878).

<text>Enrique Fernández Romero (born 23 June 1971) is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played as a left-back.

He played for four clubs during his professional career over 16 seasons – notably Deportivo which he helped win four major titles, including its only La Liga championship – amassing top-division totals of 396 games and 14 goals.

Romero represented Spain at the 2002 World Cup.

==Club career==
Born in Jerez de la Frontera, Province of Cádiz, Romero started his professional career with La Rioja&#x27;s CD Logroñés. He totalled only three La Liga games in his first two seasons but was first-choice in 1993–94, with the team again managing to retain their division status.

After having represented Valencia CF and RCD Mallorca, never appearing in less than 30 league matches during his spell at both clubs, Romero joined Deportivo de La Coruña in 1998. There, he blossomed into an attacking left-back, notably playing 50 UEFA Champions League matches for the Galicians and contributing 34 and one goal in the 1999–2000 campaign as &quot;Depor&quot; won its first national championship.

In summer 2006, after being ousted by younger Joan Capdevila – although he was a very reliable defensive unit, sometimes being deployed as central defender– Romero signed with Real Betis. After a sole season, which coincided with the emergence of new signing Fernando Vega, he opted to retire from professional football at the age of 36, having appeared in more than 500 competitive matches (nearly 400 in the Spanish top division).

==International career==
Romero won ten caps for Spain, his first appearance coming on 23 February 2000 in a friendly with Croatia, in Split. He represented the nation at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, playing three times for the eventual quarter-finalists.

<text>The City-Heiress, or, Sir Timothy Treat-all is a play by Aphra Behn first performed in 1682. The play, a Restoration comedy, reflects Behn&#x27;s own highly Royalist political point of view.

The character of Sir Timothy Treat-all is a caricature of the first Earl of Shaftesbury, a founder of the Whig party who had been arrested for high treason in 1681.

It was staged at the Dorset Garden Theatre by the Duke&#x27;s Company. The original cast included James Nokes as Sir Timothy Treatall, Thomas Betterton as Tom Wilding, Anthony Leigh as Sir Anthony Meriwill, Joseph Williams as Sir Charles Meriwill, John Bowman as Dreswell, Thomas Jevon as Fopington, Elizabeth Barry as Lady Galliard, Charlotte Butler as Charlotte, Elizabeth Currer as Diana and Elinor Leigh as Mrs Closet.

== Plot ==
The play concerns the &quot;seditious knight&quot; Sir Timothy Treat-all and his rakish Tory nephew Tom Wilding. Both vie for the affections of Charlot, the eponymous city (London) heiress. Treat-all keeps an open house for all of those who oppose the king, and he has disinherited Wilding.

Wilding launches a complex scheme to triumph over Treat-all. First, he introduces Diana (his mistress) to Treat-all as Charlot, allowing Treat-all to woo her. This allows him to court the real Charlot himself. Diana cares for Wilding, but after seeing him pursue both Charlot and Lady Galliard, she decides to make an advantageous marriage with the wealthy Treat-all.

During a staged entertainment, Wilding assumes a disguise and pretends to be a Polish nobleman. He offers Treat-all the throne of Poland, which the greedy Treat-all accepts. Wilding then arranges for a burglary, where he and Treat-all both end up bound, and the burglars take all of Treat-all&#x27;s papers. The burglars are Wilding&#x27;s confidantes, and the papers contain evidence of Treat-all&#x27;s treason.

Wilding ends up marrying Charlot, and Treat-all marries Diana. However, Treat-all is forced by blackmail to treat Wilding well and to leave him his estates. (((

In a sub-plot, Wilding successfully seduces the rich widow Lady Galliard. Shortly afterwards, one of her drunken former suitors (Sir Charles) breaks into her chamber and begins to undress. In order to get rid of him (and thinking that he will not remember their conversation), she agrees to marry him. She is then shocked to discover that two other people have overheard her make a legally binding promise of marriage.

== Reception ==
Contemporaries singled out &quot;The City Heiress&quot; as one of Behn&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; and lucrative comedies, although few modern critics have discussed it at length.

&quot;The City Heiress&quot; was one of Behn&#x27;s plays singled out by satirists for scorn. Referring to the epilogue, Robert Gould sarcastically asked,

:&quot;The City Heiress, by chast Sappho Writ:
:Where the Lewd Widow comes, with brazen Face,
:Just reeking from a Stallion&#x27;s rank Embrace
:T&#x27;acquaint the Audience with her Filthy Case.
:Where can you find a Scene for juster Praise,
:In Shakespear, Johnson, or in Fletcher&#x27;s Plays?&quot; -- &quot;The Play-House, a Satyr&quot;

Behn&#x27;s play has been called &quot;a comedy of libertine complicity: her characters act as though they believed in order, authority, true love, and marriage even though they celebrate for the better part of five acts their license to disbelieve&quot;.

Other Restoration comedies were as frank with their sexuality, and others had women choosing their lovers on the basis of their wit (while wits choose theirs on the basis of money), but Behn&#x27;s characters do not moderate their desires in their comedic solutions. Further, Treat-all&#x27;s punishment is poverty and subjugation, rather than being hanged; and Wilding&#x27;s goal is luxury, rather than moral justice. The distinctions are subtle, but it was not merely Behn&#x27;s sex that made the play offensive to moralizing poets of the 1690s and the first decade of the 18th century.

<text>La Vega () is one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is located in the Cibao Valley, the north-central region of the country, and is divided into 4 municipalities with its capital city being the namesake of La Vega. The province borders Espaillat and Hermanas Mirabal to the north, Duarte to the east, Monseñor Nouel to the south and Santiago to the west.

==History==
The first settlement made by Christopher Columbus in the area was on December 8, 1494. Its initial economic development was based on gold mining. In the early 16th century, it had a cathedral, plus two convents, the fort, a building that functioned as a hospital, and administration buildings. In La Vega the first coin was minted and the first merchants settled. It is also the site of one of the mayor battles between Spaniards and indigenous people.

On December 2, 1562, the city was destroyed by an earthquake, being moved to the southern bank of the Camú River. The second foundation of the city corresponds to its current location and it is believed that it took place between the years 1562 and 1563.

During the 17th and 18th centuries the area suffered a decline. By the first decades of the 1700s, the city of La Vega had a population that approached only 3,000 people. The City was reestablished again on March 13, 1813, when the island, after having spent some years under the French rule, was once again under the power of the Spanish Crown, until the unification of Hispaniola in 1822. During this time the progress was slow and scarce. On May 7, 1842, the city was once again struck down by an earthquake, which destroyed its main buildings, such as the Government Palace and the Church.

In the days of National Independence, the city of La Vega joined the cause of freedom with soldiers. On March 4, 1844, La Vega formalized its declaration in favor of independence, and that same day it became the first town in the country to raise the tricolor flag. Commerce, agriculture and industry gained new momentum with the immigrants from Santo Domingo, Santiago, Moca and other places. The first theater in the country, bearing the same name, was also built.

An event that strengthened the economic development of the area was the inauguration of the railway between the port of Las Cañitas (Sánchez) and the city of La Vega, the product of the efforts of the worthy Gregorio Rivas. The transport by this means of fruits and merchandise led to new living conditions. In 1915 the city received the name of a cultured city, due to its dedication to art and culture. In the place of the ruins of the first city, there is an archaeological park and a museum. Over the years, a town called Pueblo Viejo has emerged, in honor of the first place where the city existed.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; – D.M.) within them:
*La Vega (city) 
**El Ranchito (D.M.) 
**Río Verde Arriba (D.M.) 
**Cutupú
*Constanza 
**La Sabina (D.M.)
**Tireo (D.M.) 
*Jarabacoa 
**Buena Vista (D.M.)
**Manabao (D.M.) 
*Jima Abajo
**Rincón (D.M.)

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

<doc id="995932" wikidata="Q13639480" url="?curid=995932" title="Joe Ahearne">
<text>Joe Ahearne is an Irish television writer and director, best known for his work on several fantasy and science fiction based programmes including &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;Apparitions&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He also wrote the screenplay for 2013 feature film &quot;Trance&quot;.

== Career ==
Ahearne&#x27;s career began when the short film &quot;Latin for a Dark Room&quot; won an award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1994, and shortly afterwards he began working for the independent television production company World Productions. Among his work for World were episodes of the 1997 series the BBC Two drama &quot;This Life&quot;, for which Ahearne wrote two and directed another three episodes, making him the only person to both write and direct episodes for the series.

His next major production for World was the six-episode Channel Four vampire series &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, which Ahearne both wrote and directed. &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; was broadcast in 1998 to critical acclaim, and has subsequently been released on both VHS and DVD. The series also ran on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States, and the Fox Network in that country produced a pilot for their own version in 2001, although this did not lead to a series.

In 2002 Ahearne directed the pilot for the Big Bear Productions horror-fantasy drama &quot;Strange&quot;, written by Andrew Marshall and broadcast on BBC One. The pilot was successful enough for a series to be commissioned the following year, with Ahearne helming three of the six episodes, although the series was not a success and a second series did not follow.

Ahearne both wrote and directed the two-part drama-documentary series &quot;Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets&quot; for the BBC and the Discovery Channel in 2004. He was the director of five episodes of the 2005 series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, for which Ahearne was nominated for his first BAFTA.

In December 2006 his drama &quot;Perfect Parents&quot;, starring &quot;Doctor Who&quot; lead Christopher Eccleston, was aired on ITV1. The following month Ahearne returned to &quot;This Life&quot; to direct the one-off reunion episode &quot;This Life +10&quot;, shown on BBC Two on 2 January 2007.

Ahearne&#x27;s project &quot;Apparitions&quot;, a supernatural series for the BBC which he wrote and directed, began on BBC One in November 2008.

Ahearne also worked on &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot;, a fictional adventure TV-series created by David S. Goyer for Starz and BBC Worldwide. He also wrote the four-issue &quot;Fantastic Force&quot; mini-series for Marvel Comics in 2009 and &quot;Fantastic Four Annual 32&quot; in 2010.

In 2013, Ahearne co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Trance&quot;, a 2013 psychological thriller directed by Danny Boyle starring James McAvoy, which was partially a remake of Ahearne&#x27;s own version of the story, made for British television in 2001. He had sent the script to Boyle in 1994 after the release of &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;. Boyle never forgot it and over a decade later contacted Ahearne with the intention of making a feature film. It went on to receive mostly positive reviews.

In 2017 Ahearne wrote and directed the BBC One thriller mini-series &quot;The Replacement&quot;. The series consisted of three episodes and concluded with loose ends. Ahearne did not intend to continue the series as he preferred short series. His next project was his the &quot;gay thriller&quot; &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, produced by Hummingbird Films and starring &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Paul McGann. &quot;B&amp;B&quot; premiered at the 2017 London Independent Film Festival, at which it was named the Best LGBT Picture. It played at numerous other festivals and received a limited theatrical release in North America.

In 2017, Ahearne was announced as writer, director, and executive producer for the anthology series &quot;Rendlesham&quot;, based on a UFO sighting in Rendlesham in 1980. The series was to star Laurence Fishburne, also serving as executive producer. As of December 2023 the series is still yet to materialise.

<text>The Port of Miami, styled as PortMiami and formally known as the Dante B. Fascell Port of Miami, is a major seaport located in Biscayne Bay at the mouth of the Miami River in Miami, Florida. It is the largest passenger port in the world and one of the largest cargo ports in the United States. 

The port is located on Dodge, Lummus and Sam&#x27;s Islands, which is the combination of three historic islands (Dodge, Lummus and Sam&#x27;s Islands) that have since been combined into one. It is connected to Downtown Miami by Port Boulevard—a causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway—and to the neighboring Watson Island via the PortMiami Tunnel. It is named in honor of 19-term Florida Congressman Dante Fascell.

As of 2023, PortMiami accounts for approximately 334,500 jobs and has an annual economic revenue of $43 billion to the state of Florida.

==History==
In the early 1900s, Government Cut was dredged along with a new channel to what now is known as Bicentennial Park in downtown Miami. This new access to the mainland created the Main Channel which greatly improved the shipping access to the new port. From these original dredging spoils which were disposed on the south side of the new Main Channel, new islands were inadvertently created which later became Dodge, Lummus and Sam&#x27;s Island along with several other smaller islands.

PortMiami&#x27;s improved shipping access and growth of the South Florida community led to an expansion of the port. On April 5, 1960, Resolution No. 4830, &quot;Joint Resolution Providing for Construction of Modern Seaport Facilities at Dodge Island Site&quot; was approved by the Dade County Board of Commissioners. On April 6, 1960, the City of Miami approved City Resolution No. 31837 to construct the new port. The new port on Dodge Island required expansion of the island by joining it together with the surrounding islands. After the seawalls, administrative buildings, and a vehicle and railroad bridge were completed, Port of Miami operations were moved to the new Dodge Island port. Additional fill material enlarged the connected Lummus and Sam&#x27;s islands as well as the North, South and NOAO slips, creating a completely artificial island for PortMiami. 

The port is officially named after Florida House of Representatives member Dante Fascell, who served for four decades from 1955 to 1993, and died in 1998. 

In 1993, the first dredge of PortMiami occurred, deepening it to . In 2006, a $40 million project to expand the South Harbor finished. In 2011, a project to reconnect PortMiami to the mainland via railroad began. In 2013, a dredging project began to deepen the harbors around PortMiami from . In April 2019, the Miami-Dade Tourism and Ports Committee approved a deal for Royal Caribbean Cruises to build a new office and parking garage on Dodge Island.

==Today==
=== Cruise ship operations ===
PortMiami is the busiest cruise/passenger port in the world. It accommodates major cruise lines such as Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC, among others, and also serves as the homeport of the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, &quot;Icon of the Seas.&quot; Over 7.2 million cruise passengers pass through the port each year (FY2023/2024).

As of July 2024, there are nine operating passenger terminal facilities at PortMiami: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, J, and V. Of the nine, there are three facilities that are purpose-built for a specific company, while other companies share the other terminals. Other company-specific facilities are in their planning or construction stages.

==== Current passenger terminals ====
==== Terminals and projects ====
On June 28, 2016, Royal Caribbean Group announced plans for a new facility that would redevelop &quot;Terminal A&quot; at PortMiami. It would be Royal Caribbean&#x27;s homeport and be fully capable of serving larger &quot;Oasis&quot;-class ships. The terminal, dubbed the &quot;Crown of Miami,&quot; was completed in November 2018.

On March 7, 2018, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced plans for a new facility that would redevelop &quot;Terminal B&quot; at PortMiami. It would be fully capable of serving Norwegian&#x27;s largest ships, the &quot;Breakaway&quot; Plus-class ships. Norwegian originally intended to open the terminal, dubbed the &quot;Pearl of Miami,&quot; by fall 2019, but budgeting issues and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed its opening date until August 2021, when Terminal B officially serviced its first cruise ship.

On November 28, 2018, Virgin Voyages announced plans to build a new terminal located on the northwest side of PortMiami. On September 19, 2019, Virgin Voyages finalized the $150 million contract with Miami-Dade County to begin redeveloping the area currently occupied by &quot;Terminal H&quot;, which would be renamed &quot;Terminal V&quot; upon completion. This facility effectively replaced &quot;Terminal H&quot;. Prior to August 2019, &quot;Terminal H&quot; was primarily occupied by FRS Caribbean, which operated a ferry service between Miami and Bimini in the Bahamas. The new terminal is designed to be the homeport for Virgin Voyages&#x27; first two vessels, the Scarlet Lady and the Valiant Lady. &quot;Terminal V&quot; was completed in February 2022.

On September 19, 2019, Carnival Cruise Line announced that it had received approval from Miami-Dade County for an expansion of its company&#x27;s facilities at PortMiami by renovating and expanding &quot;Terminal F&quot;, making it the company&#x27;s third passenger facility at the port and the company&#x27;s largest terminal in North America, at . The terminal was completed on February 14, 2023 to coincide with the debut of Carnival&#x27;s second vessel, Carnival Celebration, which is currently homeported in Miami. The terminal will be operated by Carnival under a 20-year lease.

In July 2018, MSC Cruises announced plans to build &quot;Terminal AA/AAA&quot; for its upcoming cruise ships, a forthcoming class of cruise ship with an approximate gross tonnage of 215,800 tons. On September 19, 2019, MSC and Miami-Dade County finalized the contract to construct the new facility. The new $300 million building will span and include two berths capable of operating simultaneously, separately named as &quot;AA&quot; and &quot;AAA,&quot; and be operated by MSC under a 62-year lease. In September 2018, it was announced that Disney Cruise Line had entered into an agreement with Miami-Dade County to plan for a brand-new terminal, &quot;Terminal K&quot;, on the south side of PortMiami and east of Terminal J. The inauguration of the terminal was expected to coincide with Disney&#x27;s expansion into Miami with two vessels homeported at the port in the mid-2020s. The construction of the terminal would have been dependent on improvements made to the port&#x27;s infrastructure that could have enabled Disney&#x27;s vessels to operate on the south side of the port. Dates for groundbreaking and completion were not announced at the time of announcement. However, in July 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions, PortMiami issued a new proposal that accommodates MSC&#x27;s difficulties in receiving financing for the project by amending the ground lease, while also granting the port additional time to prepare the site for the project prior to turning over the premises to MSC. Additionally, in an effort to reduce costs for its expansion projects, the port issued an accompanying resolution requiring the new MSC complex to share facilities with Disney Cruise Line, and will require Miami-Dade County to establish a new berthing rights agreement with Disney Cruise Line based on the proposal. Construction of &quot;Terminal AA/AAA&quot; began in March 2022, and is expected to be completed in 2024. In the future, a third birth will added to operate up to three cruise ships simultaneously.

Royal Caribbean Group also announced plans to redevelop &quot;Terminal G&quot; at PortMiami. A larger terminal would be constructed, and would be able to accommodate larger &quot;Oasis&quot;-class and Icon-class ships. The new terminal is expected to be completed in winter of 2027.

=== Container ship operations ===

As the &quot;Cargo Gateway of the Americas,&quot; the port primarily handles containerized cargo with small amounts of breakbulk, vehicles and industrial equipment. It is the largest container port in the state of Florida and ninth in the United States.

Over 9.6 million tons of cargo and over (FY 2018/2019) of intermodal container traffic move through the seaport per year. The economic impact from cargo operations at PortMiami to Florida amounts to $35 billion.

As of 2021, nearly 1,000 cargo ships docked at the port. In terms of TEU, China is PortMiami&#x27;s largest trade partner, while Honduras is ranked first in terms of trade value. Computers represent the port&#x27;s most valuable export, while insulated wire and cable are considered the most valuable import.

=== Design and infrastructure ===
The port currently operates eight passenger terminals, six gantry crane wharves, seven Ro-Ro (Roll-on-Roll-off) docks, four refrigerated yards for containers, break bulk cargo warehouses and nine gantry container handling cranes. In addition, the port tenants operate the cruise and cargo terminals which includes their cargo handling and support equipment.

To retain the port&#x27;s competitive rank as a world-class port, in 1997 the port undertook a redevelopment program of over $250 million which is well underway to accommodate the changing demands of cruise vessel operators, passengers, shippers and carriers. To further resolve accessibility, the PortMiami Tunnel was constructed in 2010 and completed in 2014, providing direct vehicle access from the port to the interstate highway system via State Road 836, thereby bypassing congestion in downtown Miami.

As part of the massive PortMiami redevelopment program, new ultramodern cruise terminals, roadways and parking garages have been constructed. Additionally, a new gantry crane dock and container storage yards have been constructed along with the electrification of the gantry crane docks to include the conversion of several cranes has been completed. In addition, the Port acquired two state-of-the-art super post-panamax gantry cranes which are amongst the largest in the world; able to load and unload 22 container (8 foot wide each), or nearly 200 foot, wide mega container ships. This, along with the planned Deep Dredge Project, would make it possible for PortMiami to facilitate even the future largest containerships in the world, the Maersk Triple E Class. The new and restructured roadway system with new lighting, landscaping and signage greets visitors to the &#x27;Cruise Capital of the World and Cargo Gateway of the Americas&#x27;. The roadways will change again with the completion of the PortMiami Tunnel. And to enhance cargo port accessibility, the newly constructed Security Gates opened at the end of 2006 to increase the processing rate for container trucks and help eliminate the daily traffic backups.

==Tunnel and Deep Dredge==
Four major projects directly and indirectly related to PortMiami are expected to increase both the capacity and efficiency of the port: the expansion of the Panama Canal, the PortMiami Deep Dredge Project, the PortMiami Tunnel, and the restoration and upgrade of the bridge and rail line connecting PortMiami to the mainland.

On May 24, 2010, construction began on the Miami Port Tunnel, a $1 billion project providing a much-needed direct connection from the port to I-395. Prior to the tunnel&#x27;s completion, the only way to enter and exit the port was via surface streets through downtown Miami. Construction on the tunnel finished in 2014.

Another major development for the PortMiami was the PortMiami Deep Dredge project, enabling Super Post Panamax Megaships to enter the United States after the completion of the Panama Canal expansion in 2014. The ports of Norfolk, New York and Baltimore have also deepened their ports to the required 50 feet. It is estimated that this project could double Miami&#x27;s cargo business in the next 10 years as well as creating over 30,000 permanent jobs for Miami, which currently has a very high unemployment rate.

There were plans to build a soccer-specific stadium at PortMiami. The plans were proposed by a group, led by David Beckham, seeking to bring a Major League Soccer team to Miami. The group has stated that they would fund such a stadium privately, but there has been opposition on multiple grounds, including the added traffic to downtown Miami and the impact on wildlife. The stadium has now been relocated to a new site.

==Railroad access==

In 2011, PortMiami was awarded a federal grant, as part of the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program, to restore a connection between the Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s yard in Hialeah and PortMiami, directly connecting the port to rail networks across the United States, as well as re-establishing the port&#x27;s on-dock rail capability (loading and unloading directly between ships and trains). The railroad bridge connecting the port to the mainland was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, at which time service was suspended. The project was scheduled to be finished in time for the completion of the other projects in 2014. The rail project is related to another scheme to increase PortMiami&#x27;s capacity; an inland intermodal center, known as Flagler Logistics Hub, to be built near the airport on 300 acres of land in Hialeah.

There was some opposition to the railroad line being returned to service, with claims that it would be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as container trucks, and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. However, trains are occasional and will be reserved for specialty freight, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. As well, trains will be able to travel at up to on the newly renovated line, in contrast to the old limit of , and so will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port. However, a passenger station may be added in the future.

The cost of restoring the rail link between the port and the Hialeah Railyard was estimated at $46.9 million, $28 million of which was applied for through a federal grant in 2010. Later that year, a grant of $22 million was awarded for this project, as well as to build an on site intermodal rail yard at the port. During the 2000s the percent of Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s business has increased from around 60% to around 80% intermodal freight. However, this was partially due to a decrease in other freight traffic caused by the 2008 recession, which reduced the number of trains, many carrying rock aggregate used in construction, from about 20 to 14 per day.

There was a plan to start a passenger service connecting Jacksonville to Miami using the FECR mainline, with stops at popular tourist attractions. The State of Florida had provided $116 million of the $268 million needed to fund that project. The remaining funding for the passenger line is expected to come from a federal grant, and the remaining funding to fix the local freight line from the Port to Hialeah is supposed to come from the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC) at $10.9 million, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) at $10.9 million, with the PortMiami itself providing $4.8 million. (The passenger service never began; however, the plan was effectively replaced by Brightline.) In April 2011, Atlas Railroad Construction was chosen to rebuild the line, which was to be completed by 2012 and was estimated to remove 5% of the road traffic from the port. On July 15, 2011, a ground-breaking ceremony marking the beginning of the rail link project, which is expected to create over 800 jobs and generate $33.38 million in wages, was performed by US Senator Bill Nelson, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez, and Miami city mayor Tomás Regalado. The project has been named the &quot;PortMiami Intermodal and Rail Reconnection Project&quot;.

<text>María Trinidad Sánchez () is a province of the Dominican Republic. It was split from Samaná Province in September 1959 as Julia Molina Province; in November 1961, it got its current name. The name commemorates a distinguished female soldier in the wars of independence.
María Trinidad Sánchez was the first woman incarcerated and executed by Pedro Santana, a Dominican annexionist president.

==History==
Before the creation of the province, its territory was part of the Samaná province; It was created in 1959 with the name of the mother of Dictator Rafael Trujillo, Julia Molina. When the government was changed to that of President Bosch, the name was changed to the current one, María Trinidad Sánchez.

==Economy==
This province is a great producer of rice, coconut, cocoa, fishing among other agricultural products. Cattle cattle production. It is of a great tourist vocation due to the large number of beaches it has on its coasts and the beautiful natural landscapes it has. It has of interest such as: Cabo Francés Viejo National Park, La Gran Laguna, Laguna Gri Gri, Via Panoramica de Nagua-Cabrera or Nagua-Sánchez and the beaches Grande, El Caletón, El Bretón, La Preciosa, El Diamante, Arroyo Salado, Matancita and Poza de Bojolo.

Traditionally, the economic production of area was based on livestock, fishing and agriculture and was carried out by sea with Puerto Plata. Then in the decade of the 80s, the increase in tourist activity produced a great displacement of the rural population towards the city, so that agricultural production decreased considerably, projecting the economy of the municipality towards consumerism and not towards production, which allowed wealth to be concentrated in tourism and commercial enterprises.
Communications

There is a transportation system made up of private companies that provide public transportation services to and from: Santo Domingo, Santiago de los Caballeros, Puerto Plata, Sosúa, Gaspar Hernández and Nagua. There is also a tourist taxi company with modern and comfortable transport units. Another widely used transport system is the Motoconcho, used mainly in the urban area.

Río San Juan is also popularly known for its Laguna Gri Gri, a large mangrove lagoon where you can embark and navigate between its mysterious caves and caves that have appeared by the erosion of the years. It is called Gri Gri due to the trees that are part of its abundant vegetation on the shore. 
==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:
*Cabrera
**Arroyo Salado (D.M.)

*El Factor
**El Pozo (D.M.)
*Nagua
**Arroyo al Medio (D.M.)

<doc id="995952" wikidata="Q7251595" url="?curid=995952" title="Protest art">
<text>Protest art is the creative works produced by activists and social movements. It is a traditional means of communication, utilized by a cross section of collectives and the state to inform and persuade citizens. Protest art helps arouse base emotions in their audiences, and in return may increase the climate of tension and create new opportunities to dissent. Since art, unlike other forms of dissent, takes few financial resources, less financially able groups and parties can rely more on performance art and street art as an affordable tactic.

Protest art acts as an important tool to form social consciousness, create networks, operate accessibly, and be cost-effective. Social movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message. Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of civil disobedience. These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person. The various peace symbols, and the raised fist are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs.

Protest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of Visual arts genres, media, and disciplines.
While some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art. Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience. Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world.

There are many politically charged pieces of fine art — such as Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, some of Norman Carlberg&#x27;s Vietnam War-era work, or Susan Crile&#x27;s images of torture at Abu Ghraib.

==History==
It is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; in 1937, the last thirty years has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public.


As awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public.

==Activist art==
Activist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power. The aim of activist artists is to create art that is a form of political or social currency, actively addressing cultural power structures rather than representing them or simply describing them. Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard. It is important to note that Activist artists are not always your typical “artist.” Their works are individually created, and many of these individuals might not even consider themselves artists, but rather activists. An example of activist artwork by someone who doesn&#x27;t consider themselves to be an artist is a “Protester with Damien Hirst sign during the first week of Occupy Wall Street, September 2011.” This is someone who is using someone else&#x27;s artwork but then adding a message in text over the work to address a political or social issue. An example of activist art where someone considers themself an artist is the work “Art Workers’ Coalition, circa 1971 (photo Mehdi Khonsari)” where Mehdi&#x27;s message is that artwork&#x27;s being connected to capitalism, and how artists are influenced and catering to the financial elites of the world.

Activist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change. It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities. The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists. It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place. Many active artists have been addressing the issue of climate change in their works, but this is just an example of one of many political artworks being created through activist art.

If social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values, then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views. Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change. One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals.

===Historical basis in art and politics===
Activist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate. In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within visual arts and traditional theatre, blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two. Protest art involves creative works grounded in the act of addressing political or social issues. Protest art is a medium that is accessible to all socioeconomic classes and represents an innovative tool to expand opportunity structures. The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement. The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention.

Emerging forms of feminism and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art. The Feminist Art movement emerged in the early 60s during the second wave of feminism. Feminist artists worldwide set out to re-establish the founding pillars and reception of contemporary art. The movement inspired change, reshaped cultural attitudes and transformed gender stereotypes in the arts. The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool, guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience. The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art. Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity.

Conceptual Art sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency. Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production. Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public. Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation. Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation.

In the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose.

===Strategy and practice===
In practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations. It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.). By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions.

The use of public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art. In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self-representation by the entire community. Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake.

The Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment. It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A &amp; HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.” The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives. The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”

The A &amp; HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced. Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections. By contrast, the A &amp; HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard.

==Resistance art==
Resistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders. This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to apartheid in South Africa. The Soweto uprising marked the beginning of social change in South Africa. Resistance art grew out of the Black Consciousness Movement, a grass-roots anti-Apartheid movement that emerged in the 1960s led by the charismatic activist Steve Biko. Much of the art was public, taking the form of murals, banners, posters, t-shirts and graffiti with political messages that were confrontational and focused on the realities of life in a segregated South Africa. Willie Bester is one of South Africa&#x27;s most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist. Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint. His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community. South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships. Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective. Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.

== Humanitarian satire art ==
&quot;Humanitarian satire art&quot; was a term introduced by author Lexa Brenner. This form of activist art uses seriocomedy, controversial images, and political statements. The works mock society and give the viewers the ability to interpret their works in many different ways. The majority of the works are built around the idea of promoting changes within society over current world issues. Works are usually left in hidden places, which citizens will eventually find. The majority of humanitarian satire artworks show political messages, most often alluding to controversial political messages, revolving around contemporary social issues.

==Collections==
The Center for the Study of Political Graphics archive currently contains more than 85,000 posters and has the largest collection of post-World War II social justice posters in the United States and the second largest in the world. Many university libraries have extensive collections including the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at University of Michigan documents the history of social protest movements and marginalized political communities from the 19th century to the present.

<doc id="995958" wikidata="Q1295496" url="?curid=995958" title="Monseñor Nouel Province">
<text>Monseñor Nouel () is a province in the central region of the Dominican Republic. It was split from La Vega province in 1982.

==Name==
The province is named after Monseñor Dr. Adolfo Alejandro Nouel y Bobadilla (1862-1937), an Archbishop of Santo Domingo who was briefly President of the Republic from 1912 to 1913.

==History==
Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the territory of the Monsignor Nouel province belonged to the Taino Maguá chiefdom. In 1495, Bartolomé Colón, during a voyage of exploration across the island, ordered the construction of a fortress in Sonador to combat the resistance of the local Tainos commanded by a chief named Bonao.

It is said that the first fort built in the place was called Bonao Abajo, La Colonia or La Entrada, which was later occupied by the people of Francisco Roldán. The Indians of Rincón de Yuboa or Bonao Arriba, beaten and pressured by the Spaniards, disappeared from the place rising towards the caves of Último Cielo, in the Los Capaces jurisdiction.

In 1497, Francisco Roldán and 70 rebels, participants in the Roldán Rebellion, and took refuge in the territory of Bonao, rebelling against the authority of the Columbus brothers. The rebellion ended in October 1498. The origins of the town of Bonao are precisely associated with this rebellion, insofar as some of those who participated in it stayed there when it ended.

On December 7, 1508, Bonao was officially granted the category of town and was awarded a coat of arms. The main economic activity of this town was gold mining. When the exploitation of gold by the Spanish on the island was exhausted, two sugar mills were installed in Bonao, according to Bachelor Alonso de Parada in a report made to King Carlos V and that appears in the book Santo Domingo in the Manuscripts of Juan Bautista Muñoz transcribed by Roberto Marte:

The name of Monseñor Nouel, associated with Bonao, arose for the first time in 1936 of Santo Domingo in honor of the former president of the Republic. In 1960, the town&#x27;s name Bonao was restored, the municipality remaining with its name Monseñor Nouel, a designation that was also given to the province when it was created in 1982 under the government of then-President Salvador Jorge Blanco.

==Geography==
The province has an area of 992.39 km2 (383.16 sq mi) located in the central Cibao region. It is bordered to the North and West, by the La Vega Province, to the East the Sánchez Ramírez and Monte Plata provinces, and to the South by the San Cristóbal and San José de Ocoa provinces. The Central Mountain Range is located to the north and west of the province, while a branch of said mountain range, the Sierra de Yamasá, borders the province to the east. The main river in the province is the Yuna; all other rivers are tributaries of that river. Some of them are the Blanco, Maimon, Juma, Masipedro, Jima rivers. The Rincón dam is also located in this province. 

==Economy and development==
The main economic activity of the area is dominated by local businesses, agricultural producers and by the income generated by the mining company (Falcondo), also known as Falconbridge Dominicana. Ferronickel exploitation is located in this province, the main metallic mining activity in the country today. The main agricultural items in the province are rice, coffee and cocoa. There are also important companies that provide jobs such as: Bonao Industrial, Hanesbrands Dos Rios Textiles, Inc.

There are several public and private basic and secondary educational establishments in the province, specializing in commerce, informatics, industrial technicians; polytechnics and other fields. The city of Bonao also has a higher education center, a regional headquarters of the state Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (CURCE-UASD).

The province is home to several communication media centers, such as Television, Radio and Digital Media. In the television media, the province has the Telecasa company that offers different television channels for the towns of Bonao and Maimón, among these channels are: Yunavisión Channel 10, Maimón Tv Channel 3 and Bonao Tv Channel 12. In the media of radio are: Latina FM and Novel 93 FM.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

<doc id="995959" wikidata="Q697494" url="?curid=995959" title="Arnside">
<text>Arnside is a village and civil parish in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England. It is historically part of Westmorland, near the border with Lancashire, England. The Lake District National Park is located a few miles north. Travelling by road, Arnside is to the south of Kendal, to the east of Ulverston, to the east of Barrow-in-Furness, to the north of Lancaster and to the east of Grange-over-Sands. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,301, increasing at the 2011 census to 2,334.

It faces the estuary of the River Kent on the north-eastern corner of Morecambe Bay, within the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is overlooked by Arnside Knott, a hill that rises out of the estuary. A detailed account of the wildlife of the Arnside and Silverdale AONB is provided by John Wilson and Peter Lennon. Mammals include red squirrel and otter, breeding birds at the time of publication included the bittern which is still found in the area.

The village has been attractive to visitors since the 19th century but never developed as a traditional seaside resort. Writing in &quot;The Local Historian&quot;, Caunce describes it as &quot;an unwitting pioneer of eco-tourism&quot;, with visitors attracted by the scenery and in particular Arnside Knott.

==Buildings==

The oldest building in the parish is Arnside Tower, a Peel tower built in the 14th/15th century as a refuge against raids from Scots and the Border Reivers.

The now defunct Arnside Golf Club was founded in 1906 and closed during the World War II.

The former customs house is now occupied by the Sailing Club, and many of the buildings on the promenade were built as accommodation for visitors.

===Arnside viaduct===
The railway line is carried over the River Kent on a viaduct long, it was built in 1857 and rebuilt in 1915.
==Governance==

Arnside is part of the Morecambe and Lunesdale parliamentary constituency, for which Lizzi Collinge has been the MP since 2024, representing the Labour Party.

For local government purposes, it is administered as part of the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority.

The civil parish of Arnside includes the hamlet of Far Arnside as well as the village of Arnside. The parish is bordered by the Kent estuary to the north, Morecambe Bay to the west, Silverdale to the south (along the historic Westmorland / Lancashire county boundary), and Beetham to the east ( the eastern boundary following the railway at its north and south, and extending a little further east). The parish has its own parish council, &quot;Arnside Parish Council&quot;.

==Transport==
Arnside has its own railway station, Arnside railway station, which lies on the Furness line giving connections to , , , , and . The Furness Line passes over the River Kent via the Arnside Viaduct.

==Tides==
With each high tide, the coast of Arnside is subjected to a very fast rising tide. Because of the potential danger warning notices are posted at the pier, and an audible warning is sounded before every high tide (in daylight). The sequence of warnings is:-
# Eight sounds on the siren - around 2.25 h before high tide
# Eight sounds on the siren - around 1.75 h before high tide
# Twelve sounds on the siren - around 1.25 h before high tide, when the incoming tide is just visible from the Coastguard station (location of the siren )
The cause of this fast tide is a combination of the large area of Morecambe Bay, which narrows rapidly at Arnside, plus the second highest tidal range (at Barrow-in-Furness), which can be as much as on a spring tide nearest the spring and autumn equinox: these typically give rise to a tidal bore, which may be as high as , and is often used by canoeists.

==Notable people==
* Helen Blackler (1902–1981), psychologist, botanical collector and museum curator
*Robert Wilson (1922-1980), first-class cricketer and Royal Air Force officer
* Bob Braithwaite (1925 – 2015) trap shooter, gold medallist at the 1968 Summer Olympics
* Barbara Rosemary Grant FRS FRSC (born 1936), evolutionary biologist at Princeton University.

<text>FilmFlex, is an on-demand movie rental services provider, claiming to be largest outside the US.

The service originally launched as a joint venture between Sony Pictures Television and The Walt Disney Company, but it was sold in 2014 to Vubiquity.

== Virgin Movies ==
Virgin Movies makes up part of Virgin Media&#x27;s &quot;On Demand&quot; video on demand system. Virgin Movies has been available on Virgin since January 2005 and saw over 11 million films watched on demand in 2009. FilmFlex replaced &quot;Front Row&quot; which was a near video on demand pay-per-view service which was initially available on analogue cable from 1997, switching to digital when digital cable services launched from late 1999 onwards. On 13 September 2012, the FilmFlex service was rebranded as Virgin Movies on the cable platform.

Virgin Movies provides over 500 movies some of which are available in HD (high definition), which are available at any time for the viewer to watch when they want to. Viewers can search for a movie by title, genre, cast or director. Once a movie has been ordered it can be viewed any time within the next 24 hours before it has to be paid for again. The movie can also be viewed as many times as the viewer likes within the 24 hours for no additional cost. Once viewers are watching a movie they have full control over it by the use of pause, rewind and fast forward functions, much like a DVD.

All genres of movies are available ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to action, adventure, horror, comedy, romance and classic movies.

On 8 February 2013, the two companies signed a multi-year deal, with investment in the development of next-gen functionality on Virgin Movies, including &quot;multi-device playback&quot; through Virgin TV Anywhere.

=== Virgin Media Online Movies ===
On 26 April 2010, Virgin Media announced the launch of its first online movies service: Virgin Media Online Movies. All rentals will offer unlimited streamed views for 48 hours so viewers can pause, rewind and watch again, plus the film can be watched wherever the account holder logs on. Virgin Media Online Movies is powered by FilmFlex, the service is delivered over the web using Microsoft Silverlight and will initially present movies in standard definition. A HD version of the service was tested, although has not been made available.

=== Penny Movies Festival ===
From 30 March 2007 Virgin Media ran a movies promotion called the &#x27;Penny Movies Festival&#x27;. The promotion was run over five weeks and each week focused on a different genre. Week one: blockbusters, week two: family favourites, week three: cult classics, week four: comedy, week five: action adventure.

Each week viewers could vote on the Virgin Media website for their favourite movie out of a selection of 15 movies and the winning movie would be available to view on the On Demand service, during the next week for the price of 1p.

The festival returned in 2008.

== Film4oD ==
Channel 4 partnered with FilmFlex to launch an online video on-demand service for Film4. Film4oD, which officially launched on 1 November 2010, had more than 500 films available for 48-hour rental online. It closed in 2015.

<text>Hand signals are agreed gestures that people make with their hands or body to communicate in a non-verbal way. When used in traffic, hand signals are often used to convey driver&#x27;s intention of their next movement. In some countries, hand signals can apply to any vehicle whose signal lights are missing or damaged. Hand signals are commonly used and applies to cyclists and motorists. Hand signals are commonly used to signal a left turn, right turn, overtaking, slowing or stopping.

==Left Turn==
===All countries=== 
To signal a left turn, the driver horizontally extends their left arm outwards.

===South Africa=== 
The driver extends their right arm with the forearm pointing vertically downwards and moving in a circular anti-clockwise motion. Drivers of tractors, animal-drawn vehicles and two-wheeled vehicles may also extend their left arm horizontally with the palm facing forwards. Signal lights or turn indicators may be used in place of hand signals if installed.
==Right Turn==
===US and Canada=== 
There are two methods for signaling a right turn. The first, more commonly known signal is to extend the left upper arm out to the left, horizontally, and angle one&#x27;s forearm vertically upward. The second method is to extend the right arm perpendicular to the body, pointing in the same direction as the intended turn. Some states do not recognize the right arm because drivers are taught to only look at the bicyclist’s left arm for all signals, but most states allow the use of either arm. 

The Uniform Vehicle Code in the US recognizes both signals. State traffic laws generally conform to the Uniform Vehicle Code, but exceptions may exist. Both signals are recognized in British Columbia, Canada.

===South Africa and Denmark=== 
The driver extends their right arm horizontally with the palm to the front. If a vehicle is fitted with turn indicators, they may be used instead.

This signal has the advantage of being more visible to affected traffic, specifically vehicles in the next lane to the right. It is also more easily understood by children. 

== Overtaking ==
In right-hand traffic countries, the left turn-hand signal is used to before normal overtaking to the left.Correspondingly, in left-hand traffic countries, a right-hand signal is used before normal overtaking on the right.

===South Africa=== 
A vehicle may signal a vehicle behind them to overtake them by extending the right arm below shoulder level, with the palm facing forwards, and moving the arms backwards and forwards.

== Slowing Down ==
===South Africa and Denmark===
Sudden reduction in speed requires the same signal as stopping, (i.e. the extending the right arm is horizontally with the palm facing downwards and the hand rotating up and down at the wrist, see Stopping section). The driver is also permitted to extend their right arm horizontally with the palm facing down and move their arm in a vertical motion.
==Stopping/Braking==

===UK and Ireland=== 
To signal they intend to slow down or stop, the driver, cyclist or horse rider should extend their right arm slightly below horizontally with their palm facing downwards, then move it up and down.

===US and Canada===
The left arm is horizontally extended with the forearm angled downward. 

===Italy===
The right arm is vertically extended with the palm facing forward. Cyclists use a different hand signal to indicate a right turn. When a cyclist wishes to turn right, they typically extend their right arm straight out to the right side of the bicycle.

===Australia=== 
The right arm is vertically extended with the palm facing forward. Alternatively, the right upper arm is extended horizontally with the forearm extended downwards, palm facing forward. 

===Denmark=== 
Either arm is extended vertically. It is also common practice to extend the upper arm horizontally with the forearm extended downwards, palm facing forward. 

===South Africa===
The right upper arm is extended horizontally, with the forearm vertical and palm facing forward as depicted in the US right turn signal above.

<text>Henry Burghersh (1292 – 4 December 1340), was Bishop of Lincoln (1320-1340) and served as Lord Chancellor of England (1328–1330). He was a younger son of Robert de Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh (died 1306), and a nephew of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere. He was educated in France.

On 27 May 1320 owing to Badlesmere&#x27;s influence Pope John XXII appointed Burghersh bishop of Lincoln in spite of the fact that the chapter had already made an election to the vacant bishopric, and he was consecrated bishop on 20 July 1320. After the execution of Badlesmere in 1322 Burghersh&#x27;s lands were seized by King Edward II, and the pope was urged to deprive him; about 1326, however, his possessions were restored, a proceeding which did not prevent him from joining Edward&#x27;s wife, Queen Isabella, and taking part in the movement which led to the deposition and murder of the king.

Enjoying the favour of the new king, Edward III, the bishop was Lord Treasurer from 1327 to 1328 and then became chancellor of England in 1328; but he failed to secure the archbishopric of Canterbury which became vacant about the same time, and was deprived of his office of chancellor and imprisoned when Isabella lost her power in 1330. But he was soon released and again in a position of influence. He was treasurer of England from 1334 to 1337, and high in the favour and often in the company of Edward III; he was sent on several important errands, and entrusted with important commissions. He died at Ghent on 4 December 1340.

<doc id="995964" wikidata="Q2484647" url="?curid=995964" title="Minnesota State Highway 100">
<text>Minnesota State Highway 100 (MN 100) is a state highway in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota, which runs from its interchange with Interstate 494 (I-494) in Bloomington and continues north to its northern terminus at its interchange with I-694 in Brooklyn Center. The southern end of MN 100 continues in Bloomington as Normandale Boulevard (County Road 34, CR 34). At the north end, the main line of MN 100 merges with I-694 in Brooklyn Center. The route is in length.

==Route description==
MN 100 serves as a north–south arterial route in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities. The roadway serves the communities of Bloomington, Edina, St. Louis Park, Golden Valley, Crystal, Robbinsdale and Brooklyn Center. MN 100 is constructed to freeway standards. The route is located in Hennepin County.
==History==

===Routing as a beltway===
The route was authorized in 1934. MN 100 was originally meant as a beltway around the Twin Cities (presumably the reason for the round number) and actually achieved that status for about 20 years in the mid-20th century (although it wasn&#x27;t a full freeway).

All of the current MN 100 was also in the original route. Starting from the current southern terminus, Old MN 100 was concurrent eastward with a pre-I-494 MN 5 past the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport to its intersection with MN 55. Old MN 100 then continued east concurrent with MN 55 over the Mendota Bridge, then along current MN 62 through Mendota Heights, then MN 100 went on Southview Boulevard into South St. Paul. Then old MN 100 followed Grand Avenue downhill, until it met old MN 56 on &quot;Concord Street&quot;. Then old MN 100 followed south on Concord Street into Inver Grove Heights, then east over the railroad bridge into Newport; and then turning north onto Century Avenue in Woodbury, which feeds into current MN 120 north of I-94 in Maplewood / Oakdale. Old MN 100 then turned west upon County Road F and north along White Bear Avenue to meet up with and concurrent westward with old MN 96 (the section of which is now County Rd 96 in Vadnais Heights and Shoreview). Old MN 100 then turned south briefly along U.S. Highway 8 (US 8, now a city maintained street in New Brighton), then old MN 100 carried on westward along the current routing of I-694 through New Brighton and Fridley to meet back at its present-day northern terminus at Brooklyn Center.

Due to traffic pattern changes over the years, it is no longer possible to directly follow the path of old MN 100. Small detours are necessary which involve the use of exits 40 and 60 of the present I-494/I-694 beltway.

===Lilac Way===

The original construction of MN 100 started in 1935, as a New Deal project. The project was a cooperative venture between the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Minnesota Highway Department, and was the largest WPA project in the state. The demand for the highway came out of growing pains in the Twin Cities during the 1920s, when Minneapolis city streets were congested and suburban roads were poorly maintained dirt roads. The plan for a beltway around the Twin Cities incorporated existing roads, both paved and unpaved. A new section of highway, between MN 5 (now I-494 and MN 5) in Edina and then-US 52 (now CR 81) in Robbinsdale was needed to complete the beltway. As such, it was planned as a state-of-the-art highway, with two lanes in each direction separated by wide medians, bridges at major intersections and railroad crossings, and the first cloverleaf interchanges in Minnesota.

Carl Graeser, the highway engineer and Arthur R. Nichols, a landscape architect, teamed up to design the highway. A large number of WPA workers worked on the construction of the highway. Since the WPA was designed to keep a large number of workers busy, a lot of hand digging was done as opposed to using bulldozers. Cloverleaf interchanges were built at MN 7, US 12 (now I-394 and US 12) and MN 55 (Olson Highway).

The landscaping of the highway was meant to give the highway a parkway-like experience. As such, it was built with a wider right-of-way than the typical highway. The Golden Valley Garden Club supported efforts to plant lilacs along the highway and the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot; coined the name &quot;Lilac Way&quot;. Eventually, 7,000 lilacs were planted. In addition, the builders built five wayside parks along the way. These parks were intended for picnicking and featured stone picnic tables, beehive barbecues, waterfalls and so on. These fixtures provided work for local stonemasons, as another part of the WPA project. The western leg was completed in 1940, but further construction on the beltway was halted with the United States&#x27; entry into World War II. An extension from then-US 52 (now CR 81) in Robbinsdale to US 10 (near present-day I-35W) in New Brighton was built with federal aid to provide access to industrial areas as an asset to the manufacture of &quot;essential war materials&quot;.

Graeser Park in Robbinsdale and the St. Louis Park Roadside Park (near the southeast corner of MN 100 and MN 7) are the only remaining roadside parks from the 1930s that are still mostly intact after widening of MN 100.

The beltline was not completed until 1950. At that point, demand from the baby boom led to rapid growth in the suburbs.

In 2009, restoration of the St. Louis Park Roadside Park was completed and the park renamed Lilac Park. As part of the restoration project, a beehive fireplace from the old Lilac Park to the north was transferred and restored. A new bicycle/walkway path constructed within the park connects the park to the Southwest LRT Trail.
===Recent construction===

Conversion of the remaining portion of the road into a freeway is complete. In 2004, construction was finished on the northern portion of MN 100 between I-394 and I-694, making MN 100 a freeway for its entire length.

The section between MN 7 and I-394 in St. Louis Park, the oldest part of the freeway, was reconstructed into a 6-lane freeway, completed in Nov. 2016. MN 100 is now 6 lanes from just north of the I-494 interchange in Edina, to the interchange at Bottineau Boulevard (County Road 81) in Robbinsdale.

As part of these projects, 2 of the original 3 cloverleaf intersections were replaced. The cloverleaf at MN 55 in Golden Valley was changed and rebuilt in 2004 as a signalized single-point urban interchange (SPUI). The cloverleaf at MN 7/CR 25 was replaced with a folded diamond interchange. The remaining cloverleaf is at the I-394 interchange.

The original Lilac Park in St. Louis Park was also lost to this construction. Several of the park&#x27;s WPA-built stone picnic tables and a beehive fireplace were saved and relocated to the remaining portion of St. Louis Park Roadside Park, which was then renamed Lilac Park.

In October 2020, Hwy. 100&#x27;s speed limit was increased to 60 miles per hour (100 km/h) for its entire length. It was originally 55 miles per hour (88 km/h) south of County Road 81 in Robbinsdale to its terminus in Bloomington.

<text>The Consolidated Mine was a gold mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia, United States, just east of Dahlonega. Like most of the area around Dahlonega, the placer mining on the land on which the mine is located probably started during the Georgia Gold Rush. By 1880, the placer deposits were exhausted and the land was down to hard rock. Gold was soon discovered in a huge quartz vein system, and mined. &quot;The richest acre&quot; was mined deep into the ground, and the resulting shaft became known as the &quot;Glory Hole.”

After an interruption of operations at the mine, a group of investors purchased about 7,000 acres (28 km2) of land around the discovery site and formed the Dahlonega Consolidated Gold Mining Co. in 1895. After constructing the largest stamp mill east of the Mississippi River at the Consolidated Mine property, the Mining Co. folded in 1906. The mine&#x27;s lower workings became flooded and lay dormant until seventy-five years later, when the site came under new ownership.

There is still gold to be mined here – but the cost of extracting the gold from the mine exceeds the value of the gold, at least for the time being. Today, a part of the upper level of the mine remains open for tourists, who can tour portions of the &quot;Glory Hole&quot; underground and pan for gold. Original cart rails, electrical lines and even an operational pneumatic drill recovered from the mine may be viewed. This mine and Crisson Mine are the two mines in the Dahlonega area that remain open for tourists. The Consolidated Mine remains the only mine in the area safe enough to take tourists into.

<doc id="995974" wikidata="Q592624" url="?curid=995974" title="Monte Cristi Province">
<text>Monte Cristi () is a province in the northwest of the Dominican Republic. The capital city is San Fernando de Monte Cristi (usually simply Monte Cristi). The spelling Montecristi is also seen. The Montecristi province is located in the Cibao frontier region, on the north coast of the country and borders the nation of Haiti. The land area of the Montecristi province is 1,924.35 km2. It is divided into six municipalities and four municipal districts. 

Montecristi is where the Duarte Highway ends, which runs through the country from South to North from the city of Santo Domingo. Additionally, the province has a network of secondary roads that interconnect the city of San Fernando de Montecristi with the other municipalities and surrounding provinces.

==History==
Monte Cristi was founded by Nicolás de Ovando in 1506 and populated in 1533 by Juan de Bolaños and 63 families from the Canary Islands. These migrated to various parts of the country afterwards leaving the town behind. It was later repopulated and became a wealthy port in the mid-to-late 16th century.

During the 1600s the coast of Montecristi was a hotbed of pirate activity in the Caribbean. In 1756 the city became a prosperous trading center, until the early 20th century.

Monte Cristi had a boom period in the last quarter of the 1800s. 

The town was at the forefront in many of the advances including the first aqueduct, first railroad and telephone. The great task of diverting the course of the Yaque del Norte River was undertaken, which had lost its initial course when the cataclysm of 1802. The town attracted people not only from Santo Domingo, Santiago, Puerto Plata and other communities, but also foreigners (English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Americans, South Americans and islanders from the other Antilles).
In 1895, it was the site of the signing of the Manifesto of Montecristi by Máximo Gómez and José Martí, at the Gómez home on Mella St. They sailed from &quot;La Granja&quot; beach, also in Montecristi, to Cuba to fight for its independence.

The economic decline of Monte Cristi began with the decrease in the demand for raw materials in Europe, difficulties of the Casa Jiménez, which the dictator Ulises Hereaux forced to escape from the hands of his political rival, Juan Isidro Jiménez, and then the problems derived from World War I.

==Geography==

The Montecristi province limits to the North with the Atlantic Ocean: to the South with the provinces Dajabón and Santiago Rodríguez; to the East with the Valverde province and to the West with the Atlantic Ocean and the Republic of Haiti. The Montecristi province is fundamentally an immense plain with many hills. El Morro, with an approximate height of 237 meters, is one of the characteristic symbols of Montecristeno relief. It is a solitary elevation, in the form of a plateau.

The Yaque del Norte River, the largest in the country, empties into the Montecristi Bay after making a long journey of 296 kilometers from the rugged Central Mountain Range. Three important rivers in the province join the Yaque del Norte: the Maguaca, the Guayubín, and the Indio. The Chacuey River and its tributary, the Macabón, are also part of the provincial basins, which complete numerous streams. The Montecristi province belongs to the Irrigation District called Bajo Yaque del Norte, with two different irrigation zones in it: Villa Vásquez and Las Matas de Santa Cruz. The first covers an area of approximately 179,733 tasks, and the second covers 320,672 tasks.

The Montecristi province has one of the most diverse and numerous systems of protected areas in the country, six in total, which include national parks, underwater national parks, wildlife refuges and scientific reserves.

==Economy==

The main activity of the province is agriculture, with important production of fruits and vegetables; in addition, the production of goats, sheep and cattle is important. On the coast, fishing and salt production are important.

Tourism development is currently concentrated in the city of Montecristi although there is potential along the entire coast, both western (Pepillo Salcedo) and north. Notable points are the Morro plateau and the Cayos Siete Hermanos.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot;, D.M.) in them:

*Castañuelas
**Palo Verde (D.M.)
*Guayubín
**Cana Chapetón (D.M.)
**Hatillo Palma (D.M.)
**Villa Elisa (D.M.)
*Las Matas de Santa Cruz
*Pepillo Salcedo
*San Fernando de Monte Cristi
*Villa Vásquez
The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;secciones&quot;: sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;parajes&quot;: stops) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

<doc id="995979" wikidata="Q2539181" url="?curid=995979" title="A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson">
<text>A Young Person&#x27;s Guide to King Crimson is a 2-LP compilation album by the band King Crimson, released in 1976. At the time of release, the band had been disbanded for nearly two years. Guitarist Robert Fripp selected the tracks for inclusion.

Its name is most likely derived either from the famous orchestral work &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; by composer Benjamin Britten or the 1960s television series &quot;Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot;, created by conductor/composer Leonard Bernstein.

The gatefold sleeve featured artwork by Scottish artist Fergus Hall, with the front cover being &quot;The Landscape Player&quot; and the back cover being &quot;Earth&quot;. Included as part of the package was a booklet, replete with photographs, and detailing gig history and notable events; this was compiled by Robert Fripp from his own archive.

To date, its sole CD release has been in Japan, in 1990. This 2-CD set, which faithfully duplicated the vinyl running order, included a reproduction of the booklet, scaled-down. Playing times are approximately 40 minutes long for CD1 and 35 minutes for CD2.

<doc id="995982" wikidata="Q1912136" url="?curid=995982" title="King Crimson Live in Hyde Park">
<text>King Crimson Live in Hyde Park is a live album by the band King Crimson, released through the King Crimson Collectors&#x27; Club in September 2002.

The album documents King Crimson&#x27;s performance at the Hyde Park Festival of July 5, 1969, held in London, England. It has been estimated that half a million people attended this outdoor concert, which was headlined by the Rolling Stones. King Crimson were the opening act. Their setlist was cut for the occasion, and the last track was much shorter than usual. Nonetheless, the consensus was that their performance was a success, which significantly increased the band&#x27;s reputation.

The CD also includes two bonus tracks. The first is a series of excerpts from a press conference, held by all five members of the original King Crimson along with the band&#x27;s road management. This conference was recorded at the release of King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Epitaph&quot; box set, featuring four CDs of concert material by the original band. The conference was held at the InterContinental London hotel on March 15, 1997.

The second bonus track is an instrumental recording of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, recorded at Morgan Studios in London on June 12, 1969. Guitarist Robert Fripp has acknowledged that his solo on this version is &quot;dismal in extremis&quot;, though noting that it was intended only as a guide track (and was subsequently replaced by a &quot;proper&quot; solo).

The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 2000, but was held up by a dispute between members of the 1969 line-up of King Crimson. The liner notes include comments from Fripp, Ian McDonald, Michael Giles, Peter Sinfield and manager David Enthoven.

<text>King Crimson Live at Summit Studios is a live album of radio session recordings by the band King Crimson, released by the Discipline Global Mobile label through the King Crimson Collectors&#x27; Club in February 2000. The album was recorded at Summit Studios in Denver, Colorado on 12 March 1972 during one of the band&#x27;s American tours. The performance was notable for the absence of the band&#x27;s trademark Mellotron, resulting in an unusual setlist and the inclusion of two lengthy collective improvisations.

The liner notes to &quot;Live at Summit Studios&quot; were written by drummer Ian Wallace, who discusses the Denver show and chronicles his involvement with King Crimson throughout 1971 and 1972. Wallace&#x27;s track &quot;My Hobby&quot; is a brief comedy piece done in a Monty Python style.

The album was later re-released in high resolution and surround sound on an audio DVD with the 40th Anniversary Edition of the live album &quot;Earthbound&quot;.

<text>The VROOOM Sessions is an album of instrumental outtakes recorded by King Crimson as studio improvisations during the rehearsals for the recording sessions of their 1994 comeback EP &quot;Vrooom&quot;.

These were the first studio recordings made by King Crimson after Robert Fripp reformed the band in 1994, in what has been called the &quot;Double Trio&quot; lineup. Along with &quot;Vrooom&quot; and the 1995 full-length &quot;THRAK&quot; and the &quot;Nashville Rehearsals&quot;, these are the only studio recordings of King Crimson&#x27;s 1994-1997 formation. These outtakes were released through the band&#x27;s Collectors&#x27; Club in December 1999, not long after Bill Bruford and Tony Levin had departed the band, bringing the Double Trio format to an end.

<text>Ladies of the Road is a live two CD set by the band King Crimson, recorded in 1971 &amp; 1972, released in 2002, and reissued in 2008 in Japan. It is named after a song on the &quot;Islands&quot; album.

The first disc consists of concert recordings performed by the band&#x27;s second touring lineup: guitarist/keyboardist Robert Fripp, vocalist/bass guitarist Boz Burrell, saxophonist/flautist/keyboardist Mel Collins, drummer/backing vocalist Ian Wallace, and lyricist Peter Sinfield, who operated the soundboard, VCS3 synthesizer and lights during live shows. The second disc consist mostly of guitar and saxophone solos from different performances of the song &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; from the 1972 American tour, edited together to form a single 46+ minute “extended” version of the song.

This set was compiled in part from King Crimson Collectors&#x27; Club albums - limited release live recordings of concert performances, studio and radio sessions.

<doc id="995994" wikidata="Q900976" url="?curid=995994" title="Electro-galvanic oxygen sensor">
<text>An electro-galvanic fuel cell is an electrochemical device which consumes a fuel to produce an electrical output by a chemical reaction. One form of electro-galvanic fuel cell based on the oxidation of lead is commonly used to measure the concentration of oxygen gas in underwater diving and medical breathing gases.

Electronically monitored or controlled diving rebreather systems, saturation diving systems, and many medical life-support systems use galvanic oxygen sensors in their control circuits to directly monitor oxygen partial pressure during operation. They are also used in oxygen analysers in recreational, technical diving and surface supplied mixed gas diving to analyse the proportion of oxygen in a nitrox, heliox or trimix breathing gas before a dive.

These cells are lead/oxygen galvanic cells where oxygen molecules are dissociated and reduced to hydroxyl ions at the cathode. The ions diffuse through the electrolyte and oxidize the lead anode. A current proportional to the rate of oxygen consumption is generated when the cathode and anode are electrically connected through a resistor

==Function==

The cell reaction for a lead/oxygen cell is: 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO, made up of the cathode reaction: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−, and anode reaction: 2Pb + 4OH− → 2PbO + 2H2O + 4e−.

The cell current is proportional to the rate of oxygen reduction at the cathode, but this is not linearly dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas to which the cell is exposed: Linearity is achieved by placing a diffusion barrier between the gas and the cathode, which limits the amount of gas reaching the cathode to an amount that can be fully reduced without significant delay, making the partial pressure in the immediate vicinity of the electrode close to zero. As a result of this the amount of oxygen reaching the electrode follows Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion and is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas beyond the membrane. This makes the current proportional to PO2. 
The load resistor over the cell allows the electronics to measure a voltage rather than a current. This voltage depends on the construction and age of the sensor, and typically varies between 7 and 28 mV for a PO2 of 0.21 bar

Diffusion is linearly dependent on the partial pressure gradient, but is also temperature dependent, and the current rises about two to three percent per kelvin rise in temperature. A negative temperature coefficient resistor is used to compensate, and for this to be effective it must be at the same temperature as the cell. Oxygen cells which may be exposed to relatively large or rapid temperature changes, like rebreathers, generally use thermally conductive paste between the temperature compensating circuit and the cell to speed up the balancing of temperature.

Temperature also affects the signal response time, which is generally between 6 and 15 seconds at room temperature for a 90% response to a step change in partial pressure. Cold cells react much slower and hot cells much faster. As the anode material is oxidised the output current drops and eventually will cease altogether. The oxidation rate depends on the oxygen reaching the anode from the sensor membrane. Lifetime is measured in oxygen-hours, and also depends on temperature and humidity

==Applications==

===Gas mixture analysis===
 
The oxygen content of a stored gas mixture can be analysed by passing a small flow of the gas over a recently calibrated cell for long enough that the output stabilises. The stable output represents the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. Care must be taken to ensure that the gas flow is not diluted by ambient air, as this would affect the reading.

===Breathing gas composition monitoring===
The partial pressure of oxygen in anaesthetic gases is monitored by siting the cell in the gas flow, which is at local atmospheric pressure, and can be calibrated to directly indicate the fraction of oxygen in the mix.

The partial pressure of oxygen in diving chambers and surface supplied breathing gas mixtures can also be monitored using these cells. This can either be done by placing the cell directly in the hyperbaric environment, wired through the hull to the monitor, or indirectly, by bleeding off gas from the hyperbaric environment or diver gas supply and analysing at atmospheric pressure, then calculating the partial pressure in the hyperbaric environment. This is frequently required in saturation diving and surface oriented surface supplied mixed gas commercial diving.

===Diving rebreather control systems===
The breathing gas mixture in a diving rebreather loop is usually measured using oxygen cells, and the output of the cells is used by either the diver or an electronic control system to control addition of oxygen to increase partial pressure when it is below the chosen lower set-point, or to flush with diluent gas when it is above the upper set-point. When the partial pressure is between the upper and lower set-points, it is suitable for breathing at that depth and is left until it changes as a result of consumption by the diver, or a change in ambient pressure as a result of a depth change.

Accuracy and reliability of measurement is important in this application for two basic reasons. Firstly, if the oxygen content is too low, the diver will lose consciousness due to hypoxia and probably die, or if the oxygen content is too high, the risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity causing convulsions and loss of consciousness, with a high risk of drowning becomes unacceptable. Secondly, decompression obligations cannot be accurately or reliably calculated if the breathing gas composition is not known. Pre-dive calibration of the cells can only check response to partial pressures up to 100% at atmospheric pressure, or 1 bar. As the set points are commonly in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar, special hyperbaric calibration equipment would be required to reliably test the response at the set-points. This equipment is available, but is expensive and not in common use, and requires the cells to be removed from the rebreather and installed in the test unit. To compensate for the possibility of a cell failure during a dive, three cells are generally fitted, on the principle that failure of one cell at a time is most likely, and that if two cells indicate the same PO2, they are more likely to be correct than the single cell with a different reading. Voting logic allows the control system to control the circuit for the rest of the dive according to the two cells assumed to be correct. This is not entirely reliable, as it is possible for two cells to fail on the same dive.

The sensors should be placed in the rebreather where a temperature gradient between the gas and the electronics in the back of the cells will not occur.

==Lifespan==
Oxygen cells behave in a similar way to electrical batteries in that they have a finite lifespan which is dependent upon use. The chemical reaction described above causes the cell to create an electrical output that has a predicted voltage which is dependent on the materials used. In theory they should give that voltage from the day they are made until they are exhausted, except that one component of the planned chemical reaction has been left out of the assembly: oxygen.

Oxygen is one of the fuels of the cell so the more oxygen there is at the reaction surface, the more electrical current is generated. The chemistry sets the voltage and the oxygen concentration controls the electric current output. If an electrical load is connected across the cell it can draw up to this current but if the cell is overloaded the voltage will drop. When the lead electrode has been substantially oxidised, the maximum current that the cell can produce will drop, and eventually linearity of output current to partial pressure of oxygen at the reactive surface will fail within the required range of measurement, and the cell will no longer be accurate.

There are two commonly used ways to specify expected sensor life span: The time in months at room temperature in air, or volume percentage oxygen hours (Vol%O2h). Storage at low oxygen partial pressure when not in use would seem an effective way to extend cell life, but when stored in anoxic conditions the sensor current will cease and the surface of the electrode may be passivated, which can lead to sensor failure. High ambient temperatures will increase sensor current, and reduce cell life. In diving service a cell typically lasts for 12 to 18 months, with perhaps 150 hours service in the diving loop at an oxygen partial pressure of about 1.2 bar and the rest of the time in storage in air at room temperature.

Failures in cells can be life-threatening for technical divers and in particular, rebreather divers. The failure modes common to these cells are: failing with a higher than expected output due to electrolyte leaks, which is usually attributable to physical damage, contamination, or other defects in manufacture, or current limitation due to exhausted cell life and non linear output across its range.

Shelf life can be maximised by keeping the cell in the sealed bag as supplied by the manufacturer until being put into service, storing the cell before and between use at or below room temperature, - a range of from 10 to 22 °C is recommended by a manufacturer - and avoid storing the cell in warm or dry environments for prolonged periods, particularly areas exposed to direct sunlight.

===Failure modes===
When new, a sensor can produce a linear output for over 4 bar partial pressure of oxygen, and as the anode is consumed the linear output range drops, eventually to below the range of partial pressures which may be expected in service, at which stage it is no longer fit to control the system. The maximum output current eventually drops below the amount needed to indicate the full range of partial pressures expected in operation. This state is called &quot;current-limited&quot;. Current limited cells do not give a high enough output in high concentrations of oxygen. The rebreather control circuit responds as if there is insufficient oxygen in the loop and injects more oxygen in an attempt to reach a setpoint the cell can never indicate, resulting in hyperoxia. When a current limited sensor can no longer reliably activate the control system at the upper set-point in a life support system, there is a severe risk of an excessive oxygen partial pressure occurring which will not be noticed, which can be life-threatening.

Other failure modes include mechanical damage, such as broken conductors, corroded contacts and loss of electrolyte due to damaged membranes.

Failing high – producing an output indicating partial pressure higher than reality – is invariably a result of a manufacturing fault or mechanical damage. In rebreathers, failing high will result in the rebreather assuming that there is more oxygen in the loop than there actually is which can result in hypoxia.

Non-linear cells do not perform in the expected manner across the required range of oxygen partial pressures. Two-point calibration against diluent and oxygen at atmospheric pressure will not pick up this fault which results in inaccurate loop contents of a rebreather. This gives the potential for decompression illness if the loop is maintained at a lower partial pressure than indicated by the cell output, or hyperoxia if the loop is maintained at a higher partial pressure than indicated by cell output.

===Testing cells in the field===
Preventing accidents in rebreathers from cell failures is possible in most cases by accurately testing the cells before use. Some divers carry out in-water checks by pushing the oxygen content in the loop to a pressure that is above that of pure oxygen at sea level to indicate if the cell is capable of high outputs. This test is only a spot check and does not accurately assess the quality of that cell or predict its failure. The only way to accurately test a cell is with a test chamber which can hold a calibrated static pressure above the upper set-point without deviation and the ability to record the output voltage over the full range of working partial pressures and graph them.

===Managing cell failure in a life-support system===
If more than one statistically independent cell is used, it is unlikely that more than one will fail at a time. If one assumes that only one cell will fail, then comparing three or more outputs which have been calibrated at two points is likely to pick up the cell which has failed by assuming that any two cells that produce the same output are correct and the one which produces a different output is defective. This assumption is usually correct in practice, particularly if there is some difference in the history of the cells involved. The concept of comparing the output from three cells at the same place in the loop and controlling the gas mixture based on the average output of the two with the most similar output at any given time is known as voting logic, and is more reliable than control based on a single cell. If the third cell output deviates sufficiently from the other two, an alarm indicates probable cell failure. If this occurs before the dive, the rebreather is deemed unsafe and should not be used. If it occurs during a dive, it indicates an unreliable control system, and the dive should be aborted. Continuing a dive using a rebreather with a failed cell alarm significantly increases the risk of a fatal loop control failure. This system is not totally reliable. There has been at least one case reported where two cells failed similarly and the control system voted out the remaining good cell.

If the probability of failure of each cell was statistically independent of the others, and each cell alone was sufficient to allow safe function of the rebreather, the use of three fully redundant cells in parallel would reduce risk of failure by five or six orders of magnitude.

The voting logic changes this considerably. A majority of cells must not fail for safe function of the unit. In order to decide whether a cell is functioning correctly, it must be compared with an expected output. This is done by comparing it against the outputs of other cells. In the case of two cells, if the outputs differ, then one at least must be wrong, but it is not known which one. In such a case the diver should assume the unit is unsafe and bail out to open circuit. With three cells, if they all differ within an accepted tolerance, they may all be deemed functional. If two differ within tolerance, and the third does not, the two within tolerance may be deemed functional, and the third faulty. If none are within tolerance of each other, they may all be faulty, and if one is not, there is no way of identifying it.

Using this logic, the improvement in reliability gained by use of voting logic where at least two sensors must function for the system to function is greatly reduced compared to the fully redundant version. Improvements are only in the order of one to two orders of magnitude. This would be great improvement over the single sensor, but the analysis above has assumed statistical independence of the failure of the sensors, which is generally not realistic.

Factors which make the cell outputs in a rebreather statistically dependent include:
*Common calibration gas - They are all calibrated together in the pre-dive check using the same diluent and oxygen supply.
*Sensors are often from the same manufacturing batch - Components, materials and processes are likely to be very similar.
*Sensors are often installed together and have since been exposed to the same PO2, temperature profile over the subsequent time.
*Common working environment, particularly with regards to temperature and relative humidity, as they are usually mounted in very close proximity in the loop, to ensure that they measure similar gas.
*Common measurement systems
*Common firmware for processing the signals

This statistical dependency can be minimised and mitigated by:
*Using sensors from different manufacturers or batches, so that no two are from the same batch 
*Changing sensors at different times, so they each have a different history
*Ensuring that the calibration gases are correct
*Adding an statistically independent PO2 measuring system to the loop at a different place, using a different model sensor, and using different electronics and software to process the signal.
*Calibrating this sensor using a different gas source to the others

An alternative method of providing redundancy in the control system is to recalibrate the sensors periodically during the dive by exposing them to a flow of either diluent or oxygen or both at different times, and using the output to check whether the cell is reacting appropriately to the known gas as the known depth. This method has the added advantage of allowing calibration at higher oxygen partial pressure than 1 bar. This procedure may be done automatically, where the system has been designed to do it, or the diver can manually perform a &quot;diluent flush&quot; at any depth at which the diluent is breathable to compare the cell PO2 readings against a known FO2 and absolute pressure to verify the displayed values. This test does not only validate the cell. If the sensor does not display the expected value, it is possible that the oxygen sensor, the pressure sensor (depth), or the gas mixture FO2, or any combination of these may be faulty. As all three of these possible faults could be life-threatening, the test is quite powerful.

==Testing==
The first commercially available certified oxygen cell checking device was launched in 2005 by Narked at 90, but did not achieve commercial success. A much revised model was released in 2007 and won the &quot;Gordon Smith Award&quot; for Innovation at the Diving Equipment Manufacturers Exhibition in Florida. Narked at 90 Ltd also won the Innovation Award for &quot;an technical diving product that has made diving safer&quot; at EUROTEK.2010 for their Oxygen Cell Checker. . The Cell Checker has been used by organisations such as Teledyne, Vandagraph, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NURC (NATO Undersea Research Centre), and Diving Diseases Research Centre.

A small pressure vessel for hyperbaric testing of cells is also available in which a pressurised oxygen atmosphere of up to 2 bar can be used to check linearity at higher pressures using the electronics of the rebreather.

<text>The gens Artoria was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions. Under the later Empire at least some of them were of senatorial rank.

==Origin==
At least two distinct linguistic origins have been proposed for the nomen &quot;Artorius&quot;. Schulze, Herbig, and Salomies propose that the name is derived from the Etruscan praenomen &quot;Arnthur&quot;, perhaps Latinized as &quot;Artor&quot;. Other scholars have proposed a Messapic origin, identifying a nomen &quot;Artorres&quot;, &quot;descendant of &quot;Artas&quot;&quot;, with a Messapic possessive suffix &quot;-orres&quot;, indicating filiation. Some scholars have suggested that &quot;Artorius&quot; might be the origin of the Welsh name &quot;Arthur&quot;.

==Praenomina==
The chief praenomina of the Artorii were &quot;Lucius&quot;, &quot;Gaius&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Quintus&quot;, four of the most common names throughout Roman history. Lesser-used praenomina of the Artorii included &quot;Gnaeus&quot;, &quot;Sextus&quot;, and &quot;Titus&quot;, and there are a few examples of other names.

==Branches and cognomina==
The Artorii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families, but a number of them used common surnames, such as &quot;Secundus&quot;, typically designating a second or younger child, and its derivatives.

<doc id="996026" wikidata="Q5153664" url="?curid=996026" title="Commonsense reasoning">
<text>In artificial intelligence (AI), commonsense reasoning is a human-like ability to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations humans encounter every day. These assumptions include judgments about the nature of physical objects, taxonomic properties, and peoples&#x27; intentions. A device that exhibits commonsense reasoning might be capable of drawing conclusions that are similar to humans&#x27; folk psychology (humans&#x27; innate ability to reason about people&#x27;s behavior and intentions) and naive physics (humans&#x27; natural understanding of the physical world).

== Definitions and characterizations ==
Some definitions and characterizations of common sense from different authors include:
* &quot;Commonsense knowledge includes the basic facts about events (including actions) and their effects, facts about knowledge and how it is obtained, facts about beliefs and desires. It also includes the basic facts about material objects and their properties.&quot;
* &quot;Commonsense knowledge differs from encyclopedic knowledge in that it deals with general knowledge rather than the details of specific entities.&quot;
* Commonsense knowledge is &quot;real world knowledge that can provide a basis for additional knowledge to be gathered and interpreted automatically&quot;.
* The commonsense world consists of &quot;time, space, physical interactions, people, and so on&quot;.
* Common sense is &quot;all the knowledge about the world that we take for granted but rarely state out loud&quot;.
* Common sense is &quot;broadly reusable background knowledge that&#x27;s not specific to a particular subject area... knowledge that you ought to have.&quot;

NYU professor Ernest Davis characterizes commonsense knowledge as &quot;what a typical seven year old knows about the world&quot;, including physical objects, substances, plants, animals, and human society. It usually excludes book-learning, specialized knowledge, and knowledge of conventions; but it sometimes includes knowledge about those topics. For example, knowing how to play cards is specialized knowledge, not &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot;; but knowing that people play cards for fun does count as &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot;.

== Commonsense reasoning problem ==

Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about &quot;naïve physics&quot; such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like &quot;If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor&quot;. Humans also have a powerful mechanism of &quot;folk psychology&quot; that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as &quot;The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence&quot;. (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators.) This lack of &quot;common knowledge&quot; means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.

Overlapping subtopics of commonsense reasoning include quantities and measurements, time and space, physics, minds, society, plans and goals, and actions and change.

== Commonsense knowledge problem ==

The commonsense knowledge problem is a current project in the sphere of artificial intelligence to create a database that contains the general knowledge most individuals are expected to have, represented in an accessible way to artificial intelligence programs that use natural language. Due to the broad scope of the commonsense knowledge, this issue is considered to be among the most difficult problems in AI research. In order for any task to be done as a human mind would manage it, the machine is required to appear as intelligent as a human being. Such tasks include object recognition, machine translation and text mining. To perform them, the machine has to be aware of the same concepts that an individual, who possess commonsense knowledge, recognizes.

== Commonsense in intelligent tasks ==
In 1961, Bar Hillel first discussed the need and significance of practical knowledge for natural language processing in the context of machine translation. Some ambiguities are resolved by using simple and easy to acquire rules. Others require a broad acknowledgement of the surrounding world, thus they require more commonsense knowledge. For instance, when a machine is used to translate a text, problems of ambiguity arise, which could be easily resolved by attaining a concrete and true understanding of the context. Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous or similar words. For example, in translating the sentences &quot;The electrician is working&quot; and &quot;The telephone is working&quot; into German, the machine translates correctly &quot;working&quot; in the means of &quot;laboring&quot; in the first one and as &quot;functioning properly&quot; in the second one. The machine has seen and read in the body of texts that the German words for &quot;laboring&quot; and &quot;electrician&quot; are frequently used in a combination and are found close together. The same applies for &quot;telephone&quot; and &quot;function properly&quot;. However, the statistical proxy which works in simple cases often fails in complex ones. Existing computer programs carry out simple language tasks by manipulating short phrases or separate words, but they don&#x27;t attempt any deeper understanding and focus on short-term results.

=== Computer vision ===
Issues of this kind arise in computer vision. For instance when looking at a photograph of a bathroom some items that are small and only partly seen, such as facecloths and bottles, are recognizable due to the surrounding objects (toilet, wash basin, bathtub), which suggest the purpose of the room. In an isolated image they would be difficult to identify.

Movies prove to be even more difficult tasks. Some movies contain scenes and moments that cannot be understood by simply matching memorized templates to images. For instance, to understand the context of the movie, the viewer is required to make inferences about characters’ intentions and make presumptions depending on their behavior. In the contemporary state of the art, it is impossible to build and manage a program that will perform such tasks as reasoning, i.e. predicting characters’ actions. The most that can be done is to identify basic actions and track characters.

=== Robotic manipulation ===
The need and importance of commonsense reasoning in autonomous robots that work in a real-life uncontrolled environment is evident. For instance, if a robot is programmed to perform the tasks of a waiter at a cocktail party, and it sees that the glass he had picked up is broken, the waiter-robot should not pour the liquid into the glass, but instead pick up another one. Such tasks seem obvious when an individual possesses simple commonsense reasoning, but to ensure that a robot will avoid such mistakes is challenging.

== Successes in automated commonsense reasoning ==
Significant progress in the field of the automated commonsense reasoning is made in the areas of the taxonomic reasoning, actions and change reasoning, reasoning about time. Each of these spheres has a well-acknowledged theory for wide range of commonsense inferences.

=== Taxonomic reasoning ===
Taxonomy is the collection of individuals and categories and their relations. Three basic relations are:
* An individual is an instance of a category. For example, the individual &quot;Tweety&quot; is an instance of the category &quot;robin&quot;.
* One category is a subset of another. For instance &quot;robin&quot; is a subset of &quot;bird&quot;.
* Two categories are disjoint. For instance &quot;robin&quot; is disjoint from &quot;penguin&quot;.
Transitivity is one type of inference in taxonomy. Since &quot;Tweety&quot; is an instance of &quot;robin&quot; and &quot;robin&quot; is a subset of &quot;bird&quot;, it follows that &quot;Tweety&quot; is an instance of &quot;bird&quot;. Inheritance is another type of inference. Since &quot;Tweety&quot; is an instance of &quot;robin&quot;, which is a subset of &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;bird&quot; is marked with property &quot;canfly&quot;, it follows that &quot;Tweety&quot; and &quot;robin&quot; have property &quot;canfly&quot;.

When an individual taxonomizes more abstract categories, outlining and delimiting specific categories becomes more problematic. Simple taxonomic structures are frequently used in AI programs. For instance, WordNet is a resource including a taxonomy, whose elements are meanings of English words. Web mining systems used to collect commonsense knowledge from Web documents focus on taxonomic relations and specifically in gathering taxonomic relations.

=== Action and change ===
The theory of action, events and change is another range of the commonsense reasoning. There are established reasoning methods for domains that satisfy the constraints listed below:
* Events are atomic, meaning one event occurs at a time and the reasoner needs to consider the state and condition of the world at the start and at the finale of the specific event, but not during the states, while there is still an evidence of on-going changes (progress).
* Every single change is a result of some event
* Events are deterministic, meaning the world&#x27;s state at the end of the event is defined by the world&#x27;s state at the beginning and the specification of the event.
* There is a single actor and all events are their actions.
* The relevant state of the world at the beginning is either known or can be calculated.

=== Temporal reasoning ===

Temporal reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about humans&#x27; knowledge of times, durations and time intervals. For example, if an individual knows that Mozart was born after Haydn and died earlier than him, they can use their temporal reasoning knowledge to deduce that Mozart had died younger than Haydn. The inferences involved reduce themselves to solving systems of linear inequalities.

To integrate that kind of reasoning with concrete purposes, such as natural language interpretation, is more challenging, because natural language expressions have context dependent interpretation. Simple tasks such as assigning timestamps to procedures cannot be done with total accuracy.

=== Qualitative reasoning ===
Qualitative reasoning is the form of commonsense reasoning analyzed with certain success. It is concerned with the direction of change in interrelated quantities. For instance, if the price of a stock goes up, the amount of stocks that are going to be sold will go down. If some ecosystem contains wolves and lambs and the number of wolves decreases, the death rate of the lambs will go down as well. This theory was firstly formulated by Johan de Kleer, who analyzed an object moving on a roller coaster.

The theory of qualitative reasoning is applied in many spheres such as physics, biology, engineering, ecology, etc. It serves as the basis for many practical programs, analogical mapping, text understanding.

== Challenges in automating commonsense reasoning ==
As of 2014, there are some commercial systems trying to make the use of commonsense reasoning significant. However, they use statistical information as a proxy for commonsense knowledge, where reasoning is absent. Current programs manipulate individual words, but they don&#x27;t attempt or offer further understanding. According to Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus, five major obstacles interfere with the producing of a satisfactory &quot;commonsense reasoner&quot;.

* First, some of the domains that are involved in commonsense reasoning are only partly understood. Individuals are far from a comprehensive understanding of domains such as communication and knowledge, interpersonal interactions or physical processes.
* Second, situations that seem easily predicted or assumed about could have logical complexity, which humans’ commonsense knowledge does not cover. Some aspects of similar situations are studied and are well understood, but there are many relations that are unknown, even in principle and how they could be represented in a form that is usable by computers.
* Third, commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning. It requires coming to a reasonable conclusion given what is already known. Plausible reasoning has been studied for many years and there are a lot of theories developed that include probabilistic reasoning and non-monotonic logic. It takes different forms that include using unreliable data and rules, whose conclusions are not certain sometimes.
* Fourth, there are many domains, in which a small number of examples are extremely frequent, whereas there is a vast number of highly infrequent examples.
* Fifth, when formulating presumptions it is challenging to discern and determine the level of abstraction.

Compared with humans, as of 2018 existing computer programs perform extremely poorly on modern &quot;commonsense reasoning&quot; benchmark tests such as the Winograd Schema Challenge. The problem of attaining human-level competency at &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot; tasks is considered to probably be &quot;AI complete&quot; (that is, solving it would require the ability to synthesize a human-level intelligence). Some researchers believe that supervised learning data is insufficient to produce an artificial general intelligence capable of commonsense reasoning, and have therefore turned to less-supervised learning techniques.

== Approaches and techniques ==
Commonsense&#x27;s reasoning study is divided into knowledge-based approaches and approaches that are based on machine learning over and using a large data corpora with limited interactions between these two types of approaches . There are also crowdsourcing approaches, attempting to construct a knowledge basis by linking the collective knowledge and the input of non-expert people. Knowledge-based approaches can be separated into approaches based on mathematical logic .

In knowledge-based approaches, the experts are analyzing the characteristics of the inferences that are required to do reasoning in a specific area or for a certain task. The knowledge-based approaches consist of mathematically grounded approaches, informal knowledge-based approaches and large-scale approaches. The mathematically grounded approaches are purely theoretical and the result is a printed paper instead of a program. The work is limited to the range of the domains and the reasoning techniques that are being reflected on. In informal knowledge-based approaches, theories of reasoning are based on anecdotal data and intuition that are results from empirical behavioral psychology. Informal approaches are common in computer programming. Two other popular techniques for extracting commonsense knowledge from Web documents involve Web mining and Crowd sourcing.

COMET (2019), which uses both the OpenAI GPT language model architecture and existing commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet, claims to generate commonsense inferences at a level approaching human benchmarks. Like many other current efforts, COMET over-relies on surface language patterns and is judged to lack deep human-level understanding of many commonsense concepts. Other language-model approaches include training on visual scenes rather than just text, and training on textual descriptions of scenarios involving commonsense physics.

<text>Abū al-Ḥusayn Muslim ibn al-Ḥajjāj ibn Muslim ibn Ward [[Banu Qushayr|al-Qushayrī]] an-Naysābūrī (; after 815 – May 875 CE / 206 – 261 AH), commonly known as Imam Muslim, was an Islamic scholar from the city of Nishapur, particularly known as a &quot;muhaddith&quot; (scholar of hadith). His hadith collection, known as &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot;, is one of the six major hadith collections in Sunni Islam and is regarded as one of the two most authentic (&quot;sahih&quot;) collections, alongside &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;.

==Biography==
Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj was born in the town of Nishapur in the Abbasid province of Khorasan, in what is now northeastern Iran. Historians differ as to his date of birth, though it is usually given as 202 AH (817/818), 204 AH (819/820), or 206 AH (821/822).

Al-Dhahabi said, &quot;It is said that he was born in the year 204 AH,&quot; though he also said, &quot;But I think he was born before that.&quot;

Ibn Khallikan could find no report of Muslim&#x27;s date of birth or age at death by any of the ḥuffāẓ &quot;hadith masters&quot;, except their agreement that he was born after 200 AH (815/816). Ibn Khallikan cites ibn al-Salah, who cites al-Hakim al-Nishapuri&#x27;s &quot;Kitab ʿUlama al-Amsar&quot;, in the claim that Muslim was 55 years old when he died on 25 Rajab, 261 AH (May 875) and therefore his year of birth must have been 206 AH (821/822).

Ibn al-Bayyiʿ reports that he was buried in Nasarabad, a suburb of Nishapur.

According to scholars, he was of Arab origin. The nisba &quot;al-Qushayri&quot; signifies he belonged to the Arab tribe of Banu Qushayr, members of which migrated to the newly conquered Persian territory during the expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate. According to two scholars, ibn al-Athīr and ibn al-Salāh, he was a member of that tribe. His family had migrated to Persia nearly two centuries earlier following the conquest.

The author&#x27;s teachers included Harmala ibn Yahya, Sa&#x27;id ibn Mansur, Abd-Allah ibn Maslamah al-Qa&#x27;nabi, al-Dhuhali, al-Bukhari, ibn Ma&#x27;in, Yahya ibn Yahya al-Nishaburi al-Tamimi, and others. Among his students were al-Tirmidhi, ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi, and Ibn Khuzayma, each of whom also wrote works on hadith. After his studies throughout the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Iraq and Syria, he settled in his hometown of Nishapur, where he met, and became a lifelong friend of al-Bukhari.

=== Sources ===
Several sources became prominent loci for learning about the biography of Muslim. The &quot;History of Baghdad&quot; by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, produced in the 11th century, formed the basis of all subsequent descriptions of his life in Islamic sources. For example, the complete biography of Muslim in the &quot;History of Islam&quot; by al-Dhahabi contains 27 reports, 11 of which (41%) come from Al-Baghdadi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;. The second most important source for information about Muslim&#x27;s life, now lost, was the &quot;History of Nishapur&quot; of al-Hakim al-Nishapuri. The &quot;History of Baghdad&quot; itself, which contains 14 reports about Muslim, took half of them (7) from the &quot;History of Nishapur&quot;.

== Sahih Muslim ==

In the mid-9th century, Muslim composed a collection of what he considered entirely sahih hadith, now known as Sahih Muslim. Today, it is considered one of the six canonical books of hadith in Sunni Islam. In particular, it along with Sahih al-Bukhari are considered the two pre-eminent collections in this canon; together they are called the Sahihayn. Figures on the number of hadiths in this book vary from three to twelve thousand, depending on whether duplicates are included, or only the text is. Muslim&#x27;s collection has a substantial overlap with Sahih al-Bukhari: according to Al-Jawzaqi, 2,326 traditions are shared between the two. The collections also roughly share 2,400 narrators; only 430 of the narrators in Sahih al-Bukhari are not found in Sahih Muslim, and only 620 narrators in Sahih Muslim are not found in Sahih al-Bukhari.

== Legacy ==
The scholar of Ahlus-Sunnah, Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh was first to recommend Muslim&#x27;s work.

Ishaq&#x27;s contemporaries did not at first accept this; Abu Zur‘a al-Razi objected that Muslim had omitted too much material which Muslim himself recognised as authentic and that he included transmitters who were weak.

Ibn Abi Hatim (d. 327/938) later accepted Muslim as &quot;trustworthy, one of the hadith masters with knowledge of hadith&quot;; but this contrasts with much more fulsome praise of Abu Zur‘a and also his father Abu Hatim. It is similar with Ibn al-Nadim.

Muslim&#x27;s book gradually increased in stature such that it is considered among Ahlus-Sunnah the most authentic collections of hadith, second only to Sahih Bukhari.

<text>Vernon Joseph Roberts (24 November 1921 – 29 July 2002), known as Mighty Panther or Mighty Panta, was a Trinidadian calypsonian, based in the United States for much of his career.

Born in Trinidad, he began recording in Trinidad in the early 1950s. In 1956, he was one of six calypso singers chosen to perform at the Governor&#x27;s House for Princess Margaret.

He left the island around 1958 for the United States, and performed there in clubs in Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, and San Diego, where he also made television appearances. He settled in Hollywood in 1962, continuing to make club appearances in Los Angeles and San Diego, and in 1966 recorded the album &quot;Songs of Dynamite&quot; issued on the Drum Boy label, a subsidiary of Jay Jay Records. He opened his own club in San Diego in 1967, with a show called &quot;The Mighty Panther and the Jungle Cats&quot; featuring other calypsonians and limbo dancers, but it was not successful and closed the following year.

He then sang regularly on cruise ships, returning to Trinidad in 1969 to sing at the Original Young Brigade Tent. After returning to the United States he lived in New York City, where he became active in the West Indian community and involved in social work. He also recorded the album &quot;Mighty Panta&#x27;s Going To The Moon&quot;, released in 1971. He was several times the master of ceremonies at the annual Labor Day Carnival in Brooklyn, and in March 2001 joined with fellow calypso performer King Wellington to perform at the People&#x27;s Poetry Gathering in Greenwich Village.

He died in The Bronx in 2002, aged 80.

<text>Sefton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside, England. Located to the south west of Maghull and to the north east of Great Crosby, it is on the flood plain of the River Alt. The village is bisected by the B5422, Brickwall Lane, which cuts also through the site of the moat of Sefton Old Hall, a recognised National Monument. At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 772, increasing to 855 at the 2011 Census.

Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Sefton is thought to be derived from the Old Norse &quot;sef&quot;, meaning &quot;sedge&quot; or &quot;rushes&quot; and &quot;tún&quot; meaning &quot;farmstead&quot;. In the past &quot;Sephton&quot; was an alternative spelling.

The Parish Church of St Helen (Church of England) - the only Grade I listed building in the Borough - was first built around 1170 as the private chapel of the Molyneux family.

This village is home to Sefton Parish Church, Saint Helen&#x27;s Well, a pre-Reformation shrine, a plague pot, the Grade II listed &#x27;Punch Bowl Inn&#x27; and the site of Sefton Mill dating back to the Middle Ages. Local folklore has it that Sefton Hall, a Royalist stronghold, was the scene of a skirmish in the English Civil War. The Georgian Rectory to nearby Sefton Parish Church was demolished in the 1970s, however the gate piers still stand at the entrance to Glebe End. The curate&#x27;s house, Lunt House, was situated in the nearby hamlet of Lunt.

==Governance==
From 1997 until 2010 the village and civil parish of Sefton was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the village now forms part of the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council the village and civil parish of Sefton is within the Park electoral ward and is represented by three councillors.

==In Art and Literature==

In Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, an engraving of a picture by Thomas Allom of the interior of the church, with a bridal couple, is accompanied by a short sketch by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in which the arrival of the groom is patiently awaited until it is learnt that he has taken fright and absconded, whereupon a young lieutenant bravely steps in and takes his place.

<doc id="996042" wikidata="Q2599551" url="?curid=996042" title="True Faith (song)">
<text>&quot;True Faith&quot; is a song by New Order, co-written and co-produced by the band and Stephen Hague. It was the first New Order single since their debut &quot;Ceremony&quot; to be issued in the UK as two separate 12&quot; singles. The second 12&quot; single features two remixes of &quot;True Faith&quot; by Shep Pettibone. Both versions of the 12&quot; (and also the edited 7&quot;) include the song &quot;1963&quot;. &quot;True Faith&quot; is one of New Order&#x27;s most popular songs.

The single peaked at No. 4 in the United Kingdom on its original release in 1987. In the United States, &quot;True Faith&quot; became New Order&#x27;s first single to chart in the Hot 100, ultimately peaking at No. 32.

A &quot;True Faith&quot; remix 12&quot; single and CD single were released in 1994, and another &quot;True Faith&quot; remix 12&quot; single and CD single were released in 2001. The 1994 remix charted in the UK at No. 9.

==Original releases==
New Order wrote and recorded &quot;True Faith&quot; and &quot;1963&quot; during a 10-day studio session with producer Stephen Hague. The two songs were written as new material for New Order&#x27;s first singles compilation album, &quot;Substance 1987&quot;. After the two songs were recorded, the band&#x27;s US management decided that &quot;True Faith&quot; was the stronger track and would be released as the new single, with &quot;1963&quot; as the B-side (&quot;1963&quot; was remixed and issued as a single in its own right in 1994).

&quot;That wasn&#x27;t really a happy period in New Order&#x27;s life,&quot; recalled Peter Hook. &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it was a bit of a battle for me to get on there at all, apart from in the sense of helping write the song. Musically, we were moving more towards straight dance and I was keen on keeping the New Order I&#x27;d known and loved. I eventually managed to get my bass on the original version. But, of course, the first thing any remixers do is take off my bass and put their own on. I sometimes feel like attaching a note saying, How about keeping the bass?&quot;

While never appearing on an original album, it was included on most of the band&#x27;s &quot;best of&quot; collections (&quot;Substance 1987&quot;, &quot;The Best of New Order&quot;, &quot;Retro&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Singles&quot; and &quot;Total&quot;). The first public performance of the song took place at the 1987 Glastonbury Festival; this version appears on the group&#x27;s &quot;BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert&quot; album.

The original 7&quot; version of the song did not appear on any album until 2011&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

==Composition==
The song is composed in the key of D minor with an outro in G major.

As is the case for many New Order songs of this period, the words in the title do not appear anywhere in the lyrics.

The original lyrics included a verse that read &quot;Now that we&#x27;ve grown up together/They&#x27;re all taking drugs with me&quot;. Hague convinced Bernard Sumner to change the latter line to &quot;They&#x27;re afraid of what they see&quot; because he was worried that otherwise it would not get played on the radio. When performing the song live, the band have usually used the original line.

During a live performance in 1993 in Reading, Sumner replaced the first lines of the second verse with the lyrics &quot;When I was a very small boy, Michael Jackson played with me. Now that we&#x27;ve grown up together, he&#x27;s playing with my willy.&quot; This was a topical reference to the allegations of sexual abuse against the singer.

==Technical details==
&quot;True Faith&quot; was recorded at Advision Studio One, with production by New Order and Stephen Hague and was engineered by David Jacob. According to Hague, the studio featured &quot;...a first generation SSL board and big old UREI Time Align monitors. &quot;True Faith&quot; was created using a wide range of electronic musical equipment. According to an interview in &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; by Richard Buskin, Hague notes that New Order provided a Yamaha QX 1, an Octave Voyetra 8 polyphonic synthesizer, a Yamaha DX 5 and an Akai S900 sampler, while he provided an E-mu Emulator II and an E-mu SP12.

==Critical reception==
In 2013, &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked &quot;True Faith&quot; number four on their list of the 10 greatest New Order songs, writing that &quot;The drums do one thing: stomp. The synth bass rolls right along, locked in the same bouncing-ball pattern forever. There&#x27;s hardly any flash on display: everything in service to everything else, all bowing to the simplicity of the song itself. Even Peter Hook, who shows up for his usual lead-bass acrobatics, is relatively restrained, in part due to the density of the mix. So it falls to the vocal to keep our attention — what we get is Bernard Sumner singing simply, plainly, effortlessly, somehow delivering some of the strongest lyrics of his career inside one of the band&#x27;s very best songs&quot;. In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 30 greatest New Order songs.

==Music video==
The release of &quot;True Faith&quot; was accompanied by a surreal music video directed and choreographed by Philippe Decouflé, produced by Michael H. Shamberg. and was edited by Marc Eskenazi.

The opening sequence, showing two men slapping each other, is a reference to Marina Abramović and Ulay&#x27;s video performance &quot;Light/Dark&quot;, shot in 1977. Costumed dancers then leap about, fight and slap each other in time to the music, while a person in dark green makeup emerges from an upside-down boxer&#x27;s speed bag and hand signs the lyrics (in LSF). Other parts of the video were inspired by Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer&#x27;s Triadisches Ballett.

The video has often been voted amongst the best music videos of its year. Sky Television&#x27;s channel &quot;The Amp&quot;, for instance, has it rated as the best video of 1987, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers rated it as the 3rd best video of 1987 and it won the British Video of the Year in 1988.

The overall tonality, themes and various elements from the video re-occurred in Decouflé&#x27;s scenography and choreography for the inauguration ceremonies of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.

The video was slightly modified for the 1994 re-release, featuring black-and-white clips of women inserted into the later parts of the video. This was also edited by Marc Eskenazi.

==Cover versions==
===George Michael version===
English singer-songwriter George Michael covered &quot;True Faith&quot; in 2011 in support of the charity fund Comic Relief. Throughout the song, Michael&#x27;s vocals are electronically masked using a vocoder, which garnered mixed reactions. In response, he joked: &quot;People like to make exceptions for me.&quot; Peaking at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart, the song made its television debut on BBC, as one of five music videos recorded for Red Nose Day 2011.

===Lotte Kestner / &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; version===
The trailer for the 2020 action-adventure video game &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; featured the character Ellie performing an acoustic rendition of the song, which bore a striking resemblance to a 2011 cover by Lotte Kestner. When Kestner revealed that she had not been credited for her cover of the song being featured, the game&#x27;s director Neil Druckmann apologized and blamed it on an oversight. The game&#x27;s publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment looked into the matter, and Kestner was subsequently credited on promotional materials. The television adaptation of &quot;The Last of Us&quot; would eventually feature Kestner&#x27;s version in the end credits to the episode &quot;Please Hold to My Hand&quot;.

=== The Flux (Noah Sebastian) / Paradise City version ===
This cover version of True Faith was performed by Noah Sebastian of Bad Omens under the fictional band The Flux. This version was composed for both the TV series Paradise City and the Official Soundtrack of the same name released by Sumerian Records.

=== Anberlin version ===
American rock band Anberlin included a cover on the Deluxe Edition of their 2008 album New Surrender.

== In popular culture ==

In the 2000 satirical-horror film rendition of &quot;American Psycho&quot;, the song is featured in the club scene where the protagonist Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is present.

<text>The Gita Govinda (; IAST: &quot;gītagovindam&quot;) is a work composed by the 12th-century Hindu poet, Jayadeva. It describes the relationship between Krishna, Radha and &quot;gopis&quot; (female cow herders) of Vrindavan.

The &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; is organized into twelve chapters. Each chapter is further sub-divided into one or more divisions called p&quot;rabandha&quot;s, totalling twenty-four in all. The prabandhas contain couplets grouped into eights, called &quot;ashtapadis&quot;. The text also elaborates the eight moods of Heroine, the &quot;Ashta Nayika&quot;, which has been an inspiration for many compositions and choreographic works in Indian classical dances. Every night in the Jagannatha temple, the &quot;Gitagovinda&quot; of Jayadeva is sung in the style of Odissi music, a tradition that has continued unbroken since the time of Jayadeva himself. Musicians of Kerala have adapted the &quot;ashtapadis&quot; into a musical form performed in temples called &quot;sopana sangeetham.&quot; Jayadeva&#x27;s hymns are also included in the Guru Granth Sahib.

==Summary==
The work delineates the love of Krishna for Radha, the milkmaid, his faithlessness and subsequent return to her, and is taken as symbolical of the human soul&#x27;s straying from its true allegiance but returning at length to the God which created it.

==Commentaries==
A large number of commentaries have been written on the text, elaborating on its meaning and music. Scholar Thomas Donaldson mentions that the Gitagovinda was known at Puri not long after its composition, for the earliest commentary on it was written in Odisha around 1190 by Udayanacharya, the &quot;Bhavavibhavini Tika&quot;.&quot;&quot; Some of the notable commentaries are Kaviraja Narayana Dasa&#x27;s &quot;Sarvangasundaritika&quot;, Rana Kumbha&#x27;s &quot;Rasikapriya Tika&quot;, Krsna Das&#x27;s &quot;Sarvangasundaritika&quot;, Dhananjaya Bipra&#x27;s &quot;Nutana Sarvangasundaritika&quot;, Lakshmana Suri&#x27;s &quot;Srtiranjani Tika&quot;, Lakshmana Bhatta&#x27;s &quot;Rasikarangadatika&quot; and Dharanidhara&#x27;s Odia &quot;Padyanuvadatika.&quot;

Within the school of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, there is a medieval commentary known as the &quot;Sri-Gita-Govinda-Vyakhayana&quot; by Prabhodananda Sarasvati. Another well-known medieval commentary is the &quot;Balabodhini-tika&quot; of Chaitanyadasa, also known as Sri Pujari Goswami (late 16th–17th centuries). A contemporary commentary from the Gaudiya Vaishnava school, drawing largely from the &quot;Balabodhini-tika&quot;, is the &quot;Balabodhini-prakasa&quot; of Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami.

==Translations==

The poem has been translated into most modern Indian languages and many European languages. There is a German rendering which Goethe read by F. H . van Dalberg. Dalberg&#x27;s version was based on the English translation done by William Jones published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta in 1792. A verse translation by the German poet Friedrich Rückert was begun in 1829 and revised according to the edited Sanskrit and Latin translations of C. Lassen in Bonn 1837. There&#x27;s also another manuscript at the Guimet Museum in Paris in Devanagari script narrating the love between Krishna and Radha. This oblong work is printed on paper in &quot;nagari&quot; script on seven lines per page, and has a foliation located in the left margin on the reverse. It is made up of 36 folios. This volume is decorated with a snow crystal motif scattered throughout the text, a practice typical of the Indian publisher Baburam. This edition was produced in Calcutta in 1808, in imitation of the manuscripts; devoid of title page, it is accompanied by a colophon. The present binding, executed at the museum in 1991, constitutes a reproduction very faithful to its original appearance.

Notable English translations are: Edwin Arnold&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Song of Songs&quot; (1875); Sri Jayadevas &quot;Gita Govinda: The loves of Krisna and Radha&quot; (Bombay 1940) by George Keyt and Harold Peiris; S. Lakshminarasimha Sastri &quot;The Gita Govinda of Jayadeva,&quot; Madras, 1956; Duncan Greenlee&#x27;s &quot;Theosophical rendering The Song of the Divine,&quot; Madras, 1962; Monica Varma&#x27;s transcreation &quot;The Gita Govinda of Jayadeva&quot; published by Writer&#x27;s Workshop, Calcutta, 1968; Barbara Stoler Miller&#x27;s &quot;Jayadeva&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Gitagovinda : Love song of the Dark Lord&quot; published by Oxford University Press, Delhi,1978; Lee Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Gitagovinda: Love Songs of Radha and Krishna&quot; published in the Clay Sanskrit series.

The first English translation of the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; was written by Sir William Jones in 1792, where &quot;Cenduli&quot; (Kenduli Sasana) of &quot;Calinga&quot; (Kalinga, ancient Odisha) is referred to as the widely-believed to be the place of Jayadeva&#x27;s origin and that the poet himself mentions this. Since then, the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; has been translated to many languages throughout the world, and is considered to be among the finest examples of Sanskrit poetry. Barbara Stoler Miller translated the book in 1977 as &quot;Love Song of the Dark Lord: Jayadeva&#x27;s Gita Govinda&quot;. The book contains a foreword by John Stratton Hawley and includes extensive commentary on the verse and topic of the poem.

== Music ==
Gita Govinda is one of the earliest musical texts in which the author indicates the exact &quot;raga&quot; (mode) and &quot;tala&quot; (rhythm) in which to sing each of the songs. These indications have been compiled below according to the &quot;ashtapadi&quot; number, based on the important ancient copies of the Gita Govinda and its commentaries such as &quot;Sarvangasundari Tika&quot; of Narayana Dasa (14th century), Dharanidhara&#x27;s Tika (16th century), Jagannatha Mishra&#x27;s Tika (16th century), &quot;Rasikapriya&quot; of Rana Kumbha (16th century) and &quot;Arthagobinda&quot; of Bajuri Dasa (17th century).

Most of the ragas and talas indicated by Jayadeva, continue to be in practice in the tradition of Odissi music. The &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot; prescribed by Jayadeva are unique to the tradition of Odissi music. It is noteworthy that in Odisha, these &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;tala&quot;s have remained in continued usage for several centuries after Jayadeva, and enjoy extreme popularity in the state till date.

Every night during the &quot;Badasinghara&quot; or the last ritual of the Jagannatha temple of Puri, the &quot;Gitagovinda&quot; of Jayadeva is sung, set to traditional Odissi ragas &amp; talas, such as Mangala Gujjari. Jayadeva mentions many ragas and talas unique to Odisha, such as &quot;aṣṭatāli&quot; or &quot;āṭhatāli&quot;. This tradition has continued unbroken since the time of Jayadeva, who himself used to sing in the temple. After the time of the poet, the singing of the Gitagovinda according to the authentic Odissi ragas &amp; talas, (such as the Raga Mangala Gujjari) was instated as a mandatory sevā at the temple, to be performed by the Maharis or Devadasis, systematically recorded in inscriptions, the &quot;Mādalā Pānji&quot; and other official documents that describe the functioning of the temple.

<text>Formula One is a series of computer and video games originally created by Psygnosis, who were eventually renamed to Studio Liverpool. It takes its name from the popular car racing series of the same name. Since 2001, the &quot;Formula One&quot; series had been made by Studio Liverpool (an internal Sony Computer Entertainment Europe game studio) formed from the restructuring of several studios including Psygnosis, which soon followed with the obtaining of an exclusive FOA Official Licence, which barred any other company to produce a Formula One game for any other platform for 5 years. Sony used this exclusive licence to make Formula One games from 2003 until 2007, releasing a new title every year which included improvements to the graphics engine as well as an updated and complete F1 grid showing the latest liveries, chassis and drivers. The series covered every year from 1995 to 2006, with the exception of the 1996 season. By February 2007, Sony lost the license to produce Formula One video games, and &quot;Formula One Championship Edition&quot;, released at the very end of the previous year, was the last game in a series that lasted more than a decade. In May 2008, Codemasters picked up the license, with Sumo Digital, producing &quot;F1 2009&quot; for the PSP and Nintendo Wii a year and a half later. Codemasters took over the license proper in 2010, and as of 2024, currently maintains the rights to exclusively produce Formula One games.

<doc id="996052" wikidata="Q108894" url="?curid=996052" title="Günter Reimann">
<text>Hans Steinicke (November 13, 1904 – February 5, 2005), better known by his pen-name Günter Reimann, was a German-born economist and writer. He was noted as founder and editor of &quot;International Reports&quot;, a New York-based weekly publication he created in 1947 and sold to the London Financial Times in 1983, and author of &quot;The Vampire Economy: Doing Business under Fascism&quot; (1939) about what he described as the onerous business policy of the Nazi Party and its disastrous effects on the Nazi economy. Prior to World War II, Reimann was a member of the Communist Party of Germany and at the forefront of the underground resistance to Adolf Hitler within Nazi Germany.

==Biography==
Reimann was born in Angermünde (near Berlin), German Empire: the Steinickes were a bourgeois German-Jewish family. Drawn to the left-wing intelligentsia at an early age in Berlin, Reimann associated and worked with Ernst Thälmann, Anna Seghers and Walter Ulbricht at the Romanisches Café. Still a teenager, Reimann assumed the position of economics editor for the communist newspaper, &quot;Die Rote Fahne&quot;, taking on the pen-name of Günter Reimann.

After the Reichstag fire in February 1933, Reimann went underground to oppose the new National Socialist regime under the resistance movement of the German social democrats and communists. In 1934, the Gestapo continued zeroing in on his location, finally raiding his house and arresting Hu Lanqi, who later became the first female general of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. Reimann fled to France and then London.

After arriving in London, he wrote &quot;The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism&quot;, published in 1939. In that treatise, Reimann documented how the oppressive rule of the Nazi regime crushed the autonomy of the private sector through severe regulations and the threat of confiscatory fines for petty offenses. As an economist, he later founded the &quot;International Reports on Finance and Currencies&quot; financial newsletter in 1947. He also authored &quot;Patents for Hitler&quot; in 1942.

After his migration to the United States, he lived in New York City, where he met Miriam Weber, a socialist activist, who he later married and fathered two children, before the two divorced. He then married Jutta Ruesch, a German citizen, and they subsequently had two children.

Reimann later moved to Manhasset, Long Island, New York. In 2004, Reimann was awarded Germany&#x27;s Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award. He died at the age of 100 on February 5, 2005. Reimann is survived by his wife Jutta, his four children, 4 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. One of his grandchildren is Melina Abdullah, co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter.

<doc id="996055" wikidata="Q2260757" url="?curid=996055" title="Scott (crater)">
<text>Scott is a lunar impact crater near the south pole of the Moon. Its location close to the lunar limb hinders observation, both from the foreshortening of the crater as seen from Earth and from the limited sunlight that enters the basin. The northern end of this crater is in near perpetual darkness, and has not been mapped in detail. Scott lies between the similar-sized crater Amundsen to the southeast and Schomberger to the northwest. Just to the northeast is the crater Demonax.

The rim of this crater has been heavily eroded and the features are worn and irregular, although the crater basin remains roughly circular. There are several crater formations attached to the west and northwest outer rim, the most well-formed of which is the satellite crater Scott E. There is also a small crater along the southeast inner wall, and several tiny craterlets across the inner floor. The interior surface is rougher at the southern end, and grows smoother and flatter toward the shadow-cloaked north end. There is no central peak at the crater midpoint.

The placement of Scott, both in relation to Amundsen and the lunar south pole, relates to the Antarctic explorers Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott, and their race to be the first humans to reach Earth&#x27;s South Pole.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Scott.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Scott A — &quot;See&quot; Nobile.

<doc id="996056" wikidata="Q7771858" url="?curid=996056" title="The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book">
<text>The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book was a fundraising book issued on behalf of Comic Relief in 1986. It was edited by Douglas Adams and Peter Fincham and contained contributions from Adams and many of the leading comedy writers and performers of the day.

== Contents ==

The book is of particular interest to fans of Douglas Adams&#x27; work as it contains several items written by him which are hard to find or exclusive to the collection. Besides the novella &quot;Young Zaphod Plays it Safe&quot; and the short story &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot;, which have since appeared in &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, the book also contains Adams&#x27; short story &quot;A Christmas Fairly Story&quot; (written in collaboration with Terry Jones) and three supplements to &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot;.

Items by other authors include:
* &quot;Adrian Mole&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, an addition to Sue Townsend&#x27;s &quot;Adrian Mole&quot; series (later included in &quot;The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole&quot;).
* &quot;A New Decade of Heroic Failures&quot;, an exclusive addition to Stephen Pile&#x27;s &quot;Book of Heroic Failures&quot;.
* Tie-ins to popular TV comedies of the day including &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

==Fundraising==

The book promised that profits would be distributed &quot;80% to SAVE THE CHILDREN FUND and OXFAM for famine relief and 20% to Charity Projects to support young people faced with the problems of drug abuse, homelessness and disability here in Britain.&quot;

==Censorship==

The book has never been reprinted following its initial print run, as a result of religious censorship.

In line with its Christmas theme the book contained several pieces based on the Christian nativity story, including:
* &quot;The Gospel According to a Sheep&quot; by Richard Curtis with additions by Douglas Adams. This tells the story of the nativity night from the point of view of a sheep that gets eaten as part of the celebrations, and therefore has a slightly jaundiced view of the whole affair.
* &quot;The Young Ones&#x27; Nativity Play&quot; in which the characters from &quot;The Young Ones&quot; act out the nativity story in typically irreverent style.
* &quot;Jesus&#x27; Birthday&quot; in which Jesus is portrayed as a grumpy and mischievous child in a modern household.

Nicholas Winterton MP led a campaign to ask W. H. Smith not to stock the book. Christian groups took offence, and attempted to get the book withdrawn. They picketed bookshops and threatened to sue for blasphemy. Eventually they prevented the book from being reprinted by applying pressure on the publisher, Collins. Collins held the rights to print certain versions of the Bible and it was threatened that these would be withdrawn. Douglas Adams complained that, as a result, considerably less money was raised for famine relief.

<doc id="996059" wikidata="Q335015" url="?curid=996059" title="Jayadeva">
<text>Jayadeva (; born ), also spelt Jaideva, was a Sanskrit poet during the 12th century. He is most known for his epic poem &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; which concentrates on Krishna&#x27;s love with the &quot;gopi&quot;, Radha, in a rite of spring. This poem, which presents the view that Radha is greater than Krishna, is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism.

Little is known of his life, except that he was a loner poet and a Hindu mendicant celebrated for his poetic genius in eastern India. Jayadeva is the earliest dated author of hymns that are included the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture of Sikhism – a religion founded in the Indian subcontinent centuries after his death.

==Biography==
He was born in a Brahmin family but the date and place of Jayadeva&#x27;s birth is uncertain. The &quot;Gitagovinda&quot; suggests that he was born in the &quot;Kindubilva&quot; village. Scholars have variously identified this place with a present-day village in their own region, including Kenduli Sasan near Puri in Odisha, Jaydev Kenduli in Birbhum district in West Bengal, and the village of Kenduli near Jhanjharpur in Mithila (Bihar). Several sixteenth-century texts declare Jayadeva was from &#x27;Utkala&#x27;, another name of Odisha. The maximum number of Gita Govinda manuscripts are available in Odisha, in a variety of shapes and sizes, where the tradition of the Gita Govinda is an integral part of regional culture. Jayadeva, a wanderer, probably visited Puri at some point and there, according to tradition, he married a dancer named Padmavati though that is not supported by early commentators and modern scholars. The poet&#x27;s parents were named Bhojadeva and Ramadevi. From temple inscriptions it is now known that Jayadeva received his education in Sanskrit poetry from a place called Kurmapataka, identified near Konark in Odisha.

=== Historical records on Jayadeva&#x27;s life ===
Inscriptions at Lingaraja temple, and the more recently discovered Madhukeswara temple and Simhachala temple that were read and interpreted by &quot;Padmashri&quot; Dr. Satyanarayana Rajguru have shed some light on Jayadeva&#x27;s early life. These inscriptions narrate how Jayadeva had been a member of the teaching faculty of the school at Kurmapataka. He might have studied at Kurmapataka as well. It must have been right after his childhood education in Kenduli village that he left for Kurmapataka and gained experience in composing poetry, music and dancing.

==Literary contributions==

Scholar Thomas Donaldson mentions that the Gitagovinda was known at Puri not long after its composition, for the earliest commentary on it was written in Odisha around 1190. The village of Kenduli Sasana is a location &quot;teeming with Vaishnava ruins and temples, perhaps more than any other site in India&quot;, notes Donaldson. He also notes an upswing in Krishna images in Odishan sculpture from the late twelfth century on, &quot;long before such images became popular in Bengal or elsewhere in India.&quot; In the Jagannatha temple of Puri, the Gita Govinda is ritually sung every night during the &quot;Badasinghara&quot; ritual from the time of Jayadeva himself. The &quot;mahari&quot;s or &quot;devadasi&quot;s were instructed to faithfully render and perform the Gitagovinda according to the ragas of Odissi music, as known from inscriptions. During the &quot;Badasinghara Besa&quot;, the nighttime attire, the deities wear a special kind of fabric known as the &quot;Kenduli Khandua&quot; or &quot;Gita Gobinda Khandua&quot;, in which lines of the Gita Govinda are woven into the fabric using the ikat technique. The weavers of Kenduli Sasana used to provide these fabrics and this is also a ritual in vogue from the time of the poet himself.

Odisha has a tradition of writing the Gita Govinda in different forms, like in the form of a manuscript designed to look like a fish, or one that is made as a garland made of small round pieces of palm leaf, used as a portable text for memory. Manuscripts of the Gita Govinda have been written and illustrated in Odisha in large numbers, some of them counting among the finest pieces of Indian art. Dr. Bhagyalipi Malla, curator of the manuscripts section of the Odisha State Museum, writes : An exceptionally large number of Gitagovinda manuscripts are preserved in the Odisha State Museum, numbering two hundred and ten. These include twenty one illustrated, one hundred and eighty non-illustrated and nine manuscripts of various shapes like garland, fish and dagger. Apart from the aforesaid palm leaf manuscripts, there are several versions of the Gitagovinda written in ivory, bamboo leaf and even handmade paper. There are eighteen different commentaries preserved in the museum.

Even today, traditional craftsmen and scribes come together in Odisha to finely stitch together leaves of the palm at one end for the manuscript to open up and fall like a chart made up of folios, on which the text of the Gita Govinda is written, complete with illustrations.

A few poems of Jayadeva written in archaic Odia have been published by the Directorate of Culture, Odisha. They describe the romance of Radha-Krishna and contain ideas very similar to those used in the Gita Govinda. Jayadeva is widely considered one of the earliest musicians of Odissi music. Every night during the &quot;Badasinghara&quot; or the last ritual of the Jagannatha temple of Puri, the &quot;Gitagovinda&quot; of Jayadeva is sung, set to traditional Odissi ragas &amp; talas, such as Mangala Gujjari. This tradition has continued unbroken since the time of Jayadeva, who himself used to sing in the temple. After the time of the poet, the singing of the Gitagovinda according to the authentic Odissi ragas &amp; talas was instated as a mandatory sevā at the temple, to be performed by the Maharis or Devadasis, systematically recorded in inscriptions, the &quot;Mādalā Pānji&quot; and other official documents that describe the functioning of the temple. To this date, the Jagannatha temple remains the fountainhead of Odissi music and the most ancient &amp; authentic compositions (including a few archaic Odia s and s by Jayadeva himself) survive in the temple tradition, although the Devadasis are no more found owing to their systematic eradication by the British government.

Two hymns of Jayadeva, have been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikh religion.

The hymns are written in a mixture of Sanskrit and eastern Apabhramsha. There are records narrating how Jayadeva&#x27;s work had a profound influence on Guru Nanak during his visit to Puri.

<text>Hurlyburly is a dark comedy play by David Rabe, first staged in 1984. The title refers to dialogue from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Hurlyburly&quot; depicts the intersecting lives of several low-to-mid-level Hollywood players in the 1980s. Fueled by large quantities of drugs, they attempt to find meaning in their isolated, empty lives.

==Title origin==
The title (meaning &quot;noisy confusion&quot; or &quot;tumult&quot;) is derived from dialogue in Act I, Scene I of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;:

*First Witch: &quot;When shall we three meet again / In thunder, lightning, or in rain?&quot;
*Second Witch: &quot;When the hurlyburly&#x27;s done, / When the battle&#x27;s lost and won.&quot;

== Notable casts ==
==Production history==
The play&#x27;s first staging was produced by the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. It opened Off-Broadway at Manhattan&#x27;s Promenade Theatre in June 1984. The Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, opened on August 7, 1984 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 343 performances. The original cast included William Hurt, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel, Jerry Stiller, Judith Ivey, Sigourney Weaver, and Cynthia Nixon.

Nixon was performing in &quot;The Real Thing&quot; at the same time. (The timing of her entrance and exit in each play allowed her to run back and forth between the two theatres, located two blocks from each other.) Replacements later in the run included Danny Aiello, Susan Anton, Christine Baranski, Frank Langella, Ron Silver, John Rubinstein and Candice Bergen.

In 1997, a version opened in the West End at the Old Vic, starring Daniel Craig, Rupert Graves, Andy Serkis, David Tennant, Jenny Seagrove, and Susannah Doyle.

A 2005 Off-Broadway revival was produced by The New Group, and starred Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton, Bobby Cannavale, Parker Posey, Wallace Shawn, Halley Wegryn Gross, and Catherine Kellner. Elizabeth Berkley took over from Catherine Kellner and received much praise, with Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; even going as far as apologizing to her for his past criticisms of her ability, stating that the fact she held &quot;her own among this skilled company of scene-stealers is a testament to how much her talent has grown&quot;. The production received critical acclaim and garnered a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Revival of a Play.

==Awards and nominations==
=== Original Broadway production ===
=== 2005 Off-Broadway revival ===
==Film adaptation==
Rabe wrote the screenplay for a 1998 film version directed by Anthony Drazan. He condensed the action into two hours and updated the setting from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. The cast included Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin, and Meg Ryan. Penn&#x27;s performance won him the Volpi Cup and Drazan was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Penn also was nominated Best Male Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards.

<doc id="996061" wikidata="Q3332843" url="?curid=996061" title="Gas blending for scuba diving">
<text>Gas blending for scuba diving (or gas mixing) is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive, by reducing the risk of decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis, and may improve ease of breathing.

Filling cylinders with a mixture of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.

Methods used include batch mixing by partial pressure or by mass fraction, and continuous blending processes. Completed blends are analysed for composition for the safety of the user. Gas blenders may be required by legislation to prove competence if filling for other persons.

==Application==
For some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used to advantage, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives. A common misconception is that nitrox can reduce narcosis, but research has shown that oxygen is also narcotic.

The increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.

For dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times.

== Hazards ==
There are several hazards associated with gas mixing:
* cylinders are filled with high pressure gas. If there is any damage or corrosion in the pressure vessel or valves of the cylinder, this is the occasion when they are most likely to fail structurally.
* oxygen supports combustion; if it comes into contact with fuel and heat the three ingredients for a fire exist. Fires in the presence of high concentrations of oxygen burn more vigorously than those in air. A fire in the presence of high-pressure gas may cause cylinders to fail.
* other high-pressure equipment such as whips, compressors, gas banks and valves are used, which can cause injury if the pressure is released or there is a mechanical failure while under pressure 
* there are dangers of fire from the fuel and electric power supplies of the compressor
* there are dangers of injury from the moving parts of the compressor
* there is the possibility of asphyxiation due to the presence, in a confined space, of large concentrations of gases that contain no oxygen, such as helium

It is possible for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. Too much or too little oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver. Oxygen analysers are used to measure the oxygen content of the mix after blending. Inadequate mixing may cause inaccurate analysis. To ensure that the composition of the gas is known by the end user, the contents are analysed in the presence of the diver who acknowledges the contents by signing a log.

It is possible that toxic contaminants, such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon lubricants, will enter the cylinders from the diving air compressor. This is generally a problem with the compressor maintenance or location of the air input to the compressor though it can be from other sources.

Toxic contaminants can also get into the breathing mix if any material inside the blending valves or pipes burns, for instance when adiabatic heating occurs when decanting or boosting oxygen.

== Oxygen precautions ==
In the presence of large volumes of high-pressure oxygen, one corner of the fire triangle exists in good measure. It is vital the other two corners are not allowed to exist.

Internally, the blending equipment and diving cylinders must be oxygen clean; all fuels and particles which could be sources of ignition must be removed. The materials chosen for use in the valves, joints and compressors must be oxygen compatible: they must not burn or degrade readily in high oxygen environments.

In gas blending, high temperatures are easily produced, by adiabatic heating, simply by decanting high-pressure gas into lower pressure pipes or cylinders. The pressure falls as the gas leaves the opened valve but then increases when the gas encounters obstructions such as a cylinder or a bend, constriction or particle in the pipe-work.

One simple way to reduce the heat of decanting is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.

Spaces where gas is blended or oxygen is stored should be well ventilated to avoid high concentrations of oxygen and the risk of fire.

== Blending nitrox ==

With nitrox there are several methods of gas mixing:
* Mixing by partial pressure: a measured pressure of oxygen is decanted into the cylinder and cylinder is &quot;topped up&quot; with air from the diving air compressor. For mixtures with oxygen fraction of 40% or more, the delivered air quality must be suited for oxygen service. This is usually achieved by using a suitable grade of oil and an extra in-line filter (hyperfilter) to reduce the residual oil contamination in the compressed air to the more stringent requirements for blending with high oxygen partial pressure gases. Cylinders used for partial pressure blending and for mixtures with oxygen fraction greater than 40% are required by law in some countries to be cleaned for oxygen service. In South Africa, a cylinder to be used for mixes with a high partial pressure of oxygen must be cleaned before being put into that service.
* Pre-mix decanting: the gas supplier provides large cylinders with popular mixes such as 32% and 36%.
* Mixing by continuous blending: regulateed flow of oxygen is fed into a static mixer with air, analysed, and fed to the compressor inlet. The compressor and particularly the compressor oil, must be suitable for this service. If the oxygen fraction is less than 40%, some countries do not require the cylinder and valve to be cleaned for oxygen service.
* Mixing by mass fraction: oxygen is added to a partially full cylinder that is accurately weighed until the required mix is achieved.
* Mixing by gas separation: a nitrogen permeable membrane is used to remove some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low-pressure air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low-pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor.

==Blending helium mixes==

Helium mixes may be made by partial pressure blending, mass fraction blending or compressing a premix blended at atmospheric pressure (continuous blending).

===Partial pressure blending===

Gas is mixed by decanting or compressing the component gases into a high-pressure cylinder, measured by partial pressure, added in sequence, and corrected for temperature.

With trimix, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted into a cylinder, which is &quot;topped up&quot; with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen. An alternative is to first decant helium into a cylinder and then top it up to the working pressure with a known nitrox mix. Both NAUI and TDI offer courses using a trimix that they call &quot;helitrox&quot;, blended by the latter method, which limit the fraction of helium to about 17–20%. Mixtures made by blending helium with nitrox containing around one-third oxygen such as EAN32 (a common premixed nitrox) have the desirable property that at their maximum operating depth for a partial pressure of oxygen of 1.4 bar, their equivalent narcotic depth is always approximately , a safe limit.

With heliox, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted or pumped into a cylinder, resulting in a two gas mix of oxygen and helium.

With heliair, a measured pressure of helium is decanted into a cylinder, which is &quot;topped up&quot; with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen, with the nitrogen:oxygen ratio fixed at 4:1.

===Mass fraction blending===

Mass fraction blending requires an accurate scale which should preferably be capable of being set to zero with the empty cylinder connected to the filling whip standing on the scale.

The masses of the gases to be mixed must be calculated based on the final partial pressure ratio and total pressure, and the cylinder is filled to the appropriate weight corresponding to the added weight of each component. The advantage of this system is that temperature does not affect the accuracy, as pressure is not measured during the process. The disadvantage is that helium has a much lower density than the other components, and a small error in measured mass of helium will result in a relatively large error in composition.

===Continuous blending and compression===
====Principle====
Continuous blending is the process of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the mixture into a storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.

====Mixing the gases====
Most high-pressure breathing gas compressors are designed to accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. and one of the usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric air, so it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric pressure in an accessory to the compressor called a &quot;mixing tube&quot; or &quot;blending stick&quot;. The mixing tube is a type of static mixer, and may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used.

One popular configuration for the mixing tube is a large bore tube with a series of internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogeneous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.

Continuous blending by adding oxygen and helium in series allows change in oxygen partial pressure to be used as a proxy for helium content measurement. The oxygen is added first, and PO2 measured after mixing, then helium is added in a second mixing tube and PO2 measured at the outlet after mixing. The difference in PO2 can be used to calculate PHe, or conversely, a desired trimix product partial pressures can be used to calculate the PO2 for the nitrox and trimix stages of the blend.

:Example:
::Desired product 50% helium, 16% oxygen, remainder nitrogen (34%). The PO2 after the helium addition must be 0.16 bar if there is negligible pressure loss.
::The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen must be 16:34, which gives 16/(16+34) = 32% oxygen, or a 0.32 bar PO2 for the nitrox.
::These values will be affected by pressure losses in the mixing tubes, so some empirical calibration may be required.

Gas flow rates are usually controlled by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, and may be measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes.

The blended gases at the intake to the compressor will be at a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by the pressure of the measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a pressure drop, as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tube and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced inlet pressure for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the pressure drop or absolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of absolute pressure at the point of measurement.

====Compression====
Many high-pressure compressors used for breathing gases are suitable for compressing breathing gas mixtures containing moderate fractions of oxygen and helium, but the manufacturer should be consulted regarding limits on both gases. Compression of mixtures with a high fraction of oxygen are an increased fire hazard, and the compressor lubricant must be compatible to minimise this risk. Helium poses a very different problem, as it is totally inert, and creates no fire hazard directly, but its temperature rises more than oxygen and nitrogen when compressed, which can cause a compressor designed for air to overheat. This can eventually lead to problems with the compressor lubricant and bearings, and if the oxygen fraction is also high, this will increase the fire hazard. Fortunately most Trimix blends have an oxygen fraction inversely related to the helium fraction, which reduces the probability of this problem.

====Analysis of the mix====
The mixed gas must be analysed before use, as an inaccurate assumption of composition can lead to problems of hypoxia or oxygen toxicity in the case of the oxygen analysis, and decompression sickness if the inert gas components differ from the planned composition. Analysis of oxygen fraction is usually done using an electro-galvanic oxygen sensor, whereas helium fraction is usually done by a heat transfer comparison between the analysed gas and a standard sample.

==Air top-up==
An air top-up, or air top, is filling a cylinder containing a gas blend with compressed air, either to the cylinder&#x27;s working pressure, or to any arbitrary or calculated lower pressure. This is exactly the same thing in principle as the final stage of a partial pressure blend, and the composition of the resulting blend can be calculated beforehand using a similar method, or just analysed after the top-up, depending on whether the exact analysis is important to the dive plan or not.

==Quantities and accuracy==

To avoid oxygen toxicity and narcosis, the diver needs to plan the required mix to be blended and to check the proportions of oxygen and inert gases in the blended mix before diving. Generally the tolerance of each final component gas fraction should be within +/-1% of the required fraction. Analysis instruments commonly used by recreational/technical diving gas blenders are typically capable of a resolution of 0.1% for both oxygen and helium.

===Calculating composition===
When blending mixes with pressures up to about , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations can be used to calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix. At this pressure and normal temperatures, air departs from linearity by about 5%, e.g. a 10-litre cylinder filled to 230 bar with air only contains about 95% of the expected 2300 litres of free air. Above this pressure, the composition of the final mix is difficult to predict using simple equations but needs the more complex Van der Waals equation.

====Ideal gas calculations====
Partial pressure blending using ideal gas calculations is fairly straightforward. The required mixture is chosen, either as a &quot;best mix&quot; which optimises the decompression advantages for acceptable oxygen exposure based on the planned dive profile, or selected from a range of standardised mixes suitable for a range of depths and times, or optimised to suit available gas stocks or other constraints. The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance.
:Examples:
:* &quot;Tx 20/40&quot; (or Tx 20/40/40) would be a trimix blend with 20% oxygen, 40% helium and the remaining 40% nitrogen. This would be suitable for depths up to if the partial pressure of oxygen is to be limited to 1.4 bar. This is a normoxic blend and is safe to use at the surface.
:* &quot;He/O2 12/88&quot; would be a heliox blend with 12% oxygen and 88% helium. This gas would be used in commercial diving to depths up to about , depending on duration, but can not be used shallower than about without risk of hypoxia.
:* &quot;Nitrox 32&quot;, or EAN 32, would be a nitrox blend with 32% oxygen and 68% nitrogen. This is a popular recreational blend for dives to depths up to .

The nitrogen in the mixture is almost always provided by topping up the cylinder with air to the filling pressure. All helium, and some of the oxygen is provided by decanting or boosting from bulk cylinders.

The amount of helium that must be decanted is very simple to calculate: Multiply the desired gas fraction of helium (FHe) by the total filling pressure (Ptot) to get partial pressure of helium (PHe). In the case of the Tx 20/40, in a 230 bar cylinder, this would be 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar (or for a 3,000 psi fill, it would require 3,000 x 40% = 1,200 psi of helium).

The amount of oxygen is more difficult to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air top-up. However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air top-up, so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar, so the air top-up pressure is 92 bar/79% = 116 bar (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500 psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230 bar - 92 bar - 116 bar = 22 bar is the added oxygen pressure required for the mix (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300 psi of oxygen).

===Real gas effects===
At pressures above about 200 bar the compression of gases begins to deviate from the ideal gas laws, and consequently partial pressure blending must take into account that the gases added at higher pressure will provide lower volumetric proportion than gases added at lower pressure, and these deviations from linearity will vary according to the gas. Calculations for high pressure partial pressure blends may require use of the Van der Waals equation. This does not affect premixed gases, which will retain their mix ratio at any pressure, so continuous blending is not affected by this problem.

Both nitrogen and oxygen compress relatively linearly and will approximate the ideal gas to much higher pressures than helium, which deviates significantly even below 200 bar. Air and nitrox mixtures can be approximated as ideal without significant error up to about 230 bar at normal temperatures.

=== Effects of adiabatic heating ===
Increases in temperature when filling make it difficult to accurately decant or pump a measured quantity of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver.

There are several solutions to this problem:
* fill the cylinder to the required pressure, let the cylinder cool and measure the gas pressure and then repeat the process until the correct pressure is achieved. The cooling interval needed depends on the ambient temperature. This step must be followed for each component of the mixture.
* fill the cylinders in a water bath. The higher thermal conductivity of water compared to air means that heat in the cylinder is more quickly removed from the cylinder as it fills. For this to produce accurate results, the filling must be slow enough to avoid a significant temperature rise. This is very slow.
* fill the cylinders with 5 to 20% more gas (as pressure readings) than required. If the overfill (in pressure while hot) is well judged, when the cylinder cools the final pressure will be within the tolerance of the required pressure. This is relatively quick, but requires good judgement based on experience, or measurement of the temperature of the gases in the cylinder after each stage of the mixing, and corrections must be made to allow for the influence of the temperature.

=== Gas analysis ===

Before a gas mix leaves the blending station and before the diver breathes from it, the fraction of oxygen in the mix should be checked. Usually electro-galvanic oxygen sensors are used to measure the oxygen fraction. Helium analyzers also exist, although they are expensive at present, which allow the Trimix diver to find out the proportion of helium in the mix.

It is important that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends. According to Mark Gresham of PSI/PCI, banging on the cylinder with a hammer will cause sonic energy induced mixing which is more effective than rolling. No experimental data was put forward regarding the quantitative effects, but when there is no further change in analysis, mixing is likely to be complete. 

Reliable specifications for the amount of agitation required for complete mixing are not available, but if the analysis remains the same before and after agitation the gas is probably fully mixed. Once mixed, gas will not stratify with time.

== Identification of cylinder contents ==
A label identifying the cylinder contents by gas type and constituent fraction may be required by law, and is useful to the user as a record of what mixture was last analysed in the cylinder. Details of the format of the label and colour coding of the cylinder vary with jurisdiction.

== Gas supplies ==
In the United Kingdom and South Africa, oxygen and helium are bought from commercial industrial and medical gas suppliers and typically delivered in 50 litre &quot;J&quot; cylinders at a maximum of 200 bar. In addition to the cost of the gas, charges may be made for cylinder rental and delivery.

The &quot;cascade system&quot; is used to decant economically from banks of storage cylinders so that the maximum possible gas is removed from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder&#x27;s pressure and then from the next higher pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximises the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimises the use of high-pressure bank gas.

Booster pumps, such as the Haskel pump, can be used to scavenge the remnants of expensive gases in nearly empty cylinders allowing low-pressure gases to be pumped safely into cylinders already containing gas at higher pressure.

==Gas blender training and competence==

Training and certification for scuba gas blending is provided by some diver training agencies, and may be required in terms of national legislation or standards. ISO 13293 provides minimum training standards for gas blenders for recreational diving services at two levels. Level 1 gas blender is competent to blend nitrox and handle oxygen, air and nitrox, i.e. nitrox gas blender, and a level 2 gas blender is also competent to mix gases containing helium and argon, i.e, a trimix gas blender.

A gas blender in terms of ISO 13293 level 1 must be competent to blend Nitrox breathing gas,and in terms of level 2, competent to blend any gases covered by the standard, which mainly includes trimix breathing gas. They must be competent to mix, measure the composition, mark the cylinder, and record specific mixtures to the specification of composition and pressure in a compatible high pressure cylinder. Oxygen cleaning and servicing of equipment, advising a diver on the use of the gas and establishing operational parameters for the gas are out of the scope of this specific competence.

<text>The [[Philips]] SAA1099 sound generator is a 6-voice sound chip used by some 1980s devices. 

It can produce several different waveforms by locking the volume envelope generator to the frequency generator, and also has a noise generator with 3 preset frequencies which can be locked to the frequency generator for greater range. It can output audio in fully independent stereo.

== Uses ==
The following sound cards and computers used the SAA1099:
* Silicon Graphics IRIS Professional 4D and IRIS Power 4D machines, released in 1987 and 1988, used the SAA1099 on the IO2 and IO3 board for sound generation. Although this feature was almost never documented or used, the chip is present and usable if addressed directly.
* The Creative Music System (C/MS) by Creative Labs, released in 1987, and also marketed at RadioShack as the Game Blaster, released in 1988. These devices contain two SAA1099 chips, for twelve voices.
* The Creative Sound Blaster 1.0 card released in 1989 (and 1.5 and 2.0 as an optional addon), included the SAA1099 chips, in addition to the OPL2 chip (aka YM3812), which became much more popular.
* The British-made SAM Coupé computer released in 1989, with a single SAA1099 on the motherboard.
* Various arcade games and the System 5 family used the SAA1099.

<doc id="996089" wikidata="Q332157" url="?curid=996089" title="Shankar Dayal Sharma">
<text>Shankar Dayal Sharma (; 19 August 1918 – 26 December 1999) was an Indian lawyer and politician who served as the President of India from 1992 to 1997.

Born in Bhopal, Sharma studied at Agra, Allahabad and Lucknow and received a doctorate in constitutional law from the University of Cambridge and was a bar-at-law from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and a Brandeis Fellow at Harvard University. During 1948–49, Sharma was one of the leaders of the movement for the merger of Bhopal State with India, a cause for which he served eight months&#x27; imprisonment.

A member of the Indian National Congress party, Sharma was chief minister (1952–56) of Bhopal State and served as a cabinet minister (1956–1971) in the government of Madhya Pradesh holding several portfolios. Sharma was president of the Bhopal State Congress Committee (1950–52), Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (1966–68) and of the All India Congress Committee (1972–74). He served as Union Minister for Communications (1974–77) under prime minister Indira Gandhi. Twice elected to the Lok Sabha, Sharma served as governor of Andhra Pradesh (1984–85), Punjab (1985–86) and Maharashtra (1986–87) before being elected unopposed as the vice president of India in 1987.

Sharma was elected president of India in 1992 and served till 1997 during which period he dealt with four prime ministers, three of whom he appointed in the last year of his presidency. He was assertive with the P. V. Narasimha Rao ministry, forcing his government to sack a governor, instigating a strong response to the demolition of the Babri Masjid and refusing to sign ordinances presented to him on the eve of elections. His appointment of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as prime minister on the grounds of him being the leader of the largest party in the Parliament attracted widespread criticism especially as Vajpayee was forced to resign in only thirteen days without facing a vote of confidence. Sharma&#x27;s appointment of H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral as prime ministers followed the assurance of support to their candidature by the Congress party but neither government lasted more than a year. Sharma chose not to seek a second term in office and was succeeded to the presidency by K. R. Narayanan.

Sharma died in 1999 and was accorded a state funeral. His samadhi lies at Karma Bhumi in Delhi.

==Early life and education==
Shankar Dayal Sharma was born on 19 August 1918 in Bhopal, then the capital of the princely state of Bhopal, in a Hindu Gaur Brahmin family. Sharma completed his schooling in Bhopal and then studied at St. John&#x27;s College, Agra and at the Allahabad and Lucknow universities obtaining a MA in English, Hindi and Sanskrit and an L.L.M. He topped both the courses, was awarded the Chakravarty Gold Medal for social service, and was a thrice swimming champion at Lucknow University and cross country running champion at Allahabad.

He obtained a doctorate in constitutional law from University of Cambridge for his thesis on &quot;Interpretation of Legislative Powers under Federal Constitutions&quot; and received a diploma in public administration from the University of London. 

Sharma began practicing law at Lucknow from 1940 where he taught law at the university and soon joined the Indian National Congress. In 1946, he was admitted to the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and taught at Cambridge University during 1946–47. The following year, he was appointed a Brandeis Fellow at Harvard University.

==Political career in Madhya Pradesh==
During 1948–49, Sharma underwent eight months&#x27; imprisonment for his leadership of the popular movement for merging the princely state of Bhopal with India. Although the Nawab of Bhopal had acceded his state to the Dominion of India, he had held out against signing the Instrument of Accession. The popular movement had the support of the Praja Mandal and an interim government with Chatur Narain Malviya as its head was constituted by the Nawab in 1948. However, as the movement gained support, the Nawab dismissed this government. Public pressure and the intervention of V. P. Menon led the Nawab to merge his state with the Indian Union in 1949 with the princely state reconstituted as Bhopal State.

Sharma was president of the Bhopal State Congress during 1950 to 1952. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Bhopal from Berasia in the elections of 1952 and became chief minister of Bhopal State in 1952. In 1956, following the reorganization of states, Bhopal State was merged with the new state of Madhya Pradesh. Sharma played an important role in retaining Bhopal as the capital of this new state. In the elections of 1957, 1962 and 1967, Sharma was elected to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Udaipura as a candidate of the Congress party. During this time he was a cabinet minister in the Madhya Pradesh government and variously held portfolios of education, law, public works, industry and commerce and revenue. As minister for education, he emphasized secular pedagogy in schools and textbooks were revised to avoid religious bias.

During 1967–68, he was president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee and served as general secretary of the party from 1968 to 1972. During the split in 1969, Sharma sided with Indira Gandhi and was removed from party posts by the president S. Nijalingappa but reappointed by Gandhi in her faction of the party.

==Parliamentary career==
Sharma was elected to the Lok Sabha from Bhopal in the general elections of 1971. The following year, he was made the president of the Indian National Congress by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Prior to his appointment as president, Sharma had been a member of the Congress Working Committee since 1967 and general secretary of the Congress party from 1968. As president, Sharma launched a public campaign against the CIA accusing it of being actively involved in fomenting violence in India.

In October 1974, Sharma was appointed Minister of Communications in the Indira Gandhi ministry and was succeeded as president of the Congress by D. K. Barooah. He remained in that post until his defeat in the general election of 1977 by Arif Baig. Sharma was reelected from Bhopal in the general election of 1980.

== Gubernatorial tenures (1984–1987) ==
=== Governor of Andhra Pradesh (1984–1985) ===
On 15 August 1984, N. T. Rama Rao, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh who led the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to victory in the state assembly election of 1983, was dismissed from that post by the governor of Andhra Pradesh, Thakur Ram Lal. He appointed N. Bhaskara Rao, who had been the finance minister under Rama Rao, as the new chief minister and gave him a month&#x27;s time to prove his majority in the Assembly despite the ousted chief minister&#x27;s claim of being able to prove his own majority in two days&#x27; time and evidence that he had the support of the majority of legislators in the assembly. Following widespread protests, Ram Lal resigned on 24 August 1984 and was replaced by Sharma.

Sharma convened a session of the Assembly on 11 September 1984 but as Bhaskara Rao failed to prove his majority within the period of one month stipulated by Ram Lal, Sharma suggested that he resign with effect from 16 September. Bhaskar Rao refused to do so seeking the reconvening of the Assembly a few days later. Sharma then dismissed him and reappointed Rama Rao as chief minister. Rama Rao won the vote of confidence when the Assembly reconvened on 20 September 1984. Soon after, the Rama Rao government called for fresh elections and Sharma dissolved the Assembly in November 1984.

In the Assembly election of 1985, TDP was returned to power with a two-thirds majority with Rama Rao returning as the chief minister. A few months later, Sharma refused to repromulgate three ordinances sent to him by the Rama Rao&#x27;s government stating that ordinances are required to be ratified by the legislature and that their repromulgation would be a constitutional impropriety. His refusal to repromulgate these ordinances, pertaining to the abolition of offices of part-time village officers, formation of districts and payment of salaries and removal of disqualifications of government employees, a fourth time soured his relation with the state government.

On 31 July 1985, Sharma&#x27;s daughter Gitanjali and his son-in-law, the Congress politician Lalit Maken, were killed by Sikh militants in retaliation for Maken&#x27;s alleged role in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Sharma was thereafter transferred to Punjab as governor and was succeeded in Andhra Pradesh by Kumudben Joshi.

===Governor of Punjab (1985–1986)===
Sharma succeeded Hokishe Sema as governor of Punjab in November 1985. His appointment came after the assembly elections in that state and in the backdrop of the Rajiv–Longowal Accord which sought to resolve the insurgency in Punjab. Sharma&#x27;s tenure was characterized by continued violence and he was replaced in April 1986 by Siddhartha Shankar Ray.

===Governor of Maharashtra (1986–1987)===
Sharma was sworn in as governor of Maharashtra in April 1986 and served until September 1987 when he was elected vice president of India.

== Vice President of India (1987–1992) ==
Sharma was nominated by the Congress party for the vice-presidential election of 1987. Although 27 candidates had filed nominations, only the nomination filed by Sharma was found valid by the returning officer. After the last date of withdrawal of candidates was over, Sharma was declared elected unanimously on 21 August 1987. Sharma was sworn in as the vice president on 3 September 1987. He was only the third person to be elected unopposed to the vice-presidency.

Sharma, who was also the ex-officio chairman of the Rajya Sabha, offered to quit in February 1988 after his ruling admitting a discussion in the house of the purported extravagance of the then governor of Andhra Pradesh was vociferously objected to by members of the government. Several ministers of the council of ministers led the protests against Sharma&#x27;s ruling even as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was present in the house, chose not to intervene or restrain the members of his party. Sharma&#x27;s response chastened the protesting members but their request to have the proceedings expunged from Parliament records was turned down by Sharma.

In 1991, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Sharma was first offered the presidentship of the Congress party and the post of prime minister by Sonia Gandhi. He however refused citing ill health and advanced age. Thereafter, P. V. Narasimha Rao was chosen to lead the Congress party.

== President of India (1992–1997) ==

In June 1992, Sharma was chosen by the Congress party as its candidate for the presidential election of 1992 to succeed R. Venkataraman. His nomination was also supported by the communist parties. The election was held on 13 July 1992 and votes counted three days later. Sharma won 675,804 votes against the 346,485 votes polled by his main opponent George Gilbert Swell, who was the nominee of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Two other candidates – Ram Jethmalani and Kaka Joginder Singh – won a small number of votes. Sharma was declared elected on 16 July 1992 and was sworn in as president on 25 July 1992. In his inaugural address, Sharma stated that &quot;Freedom has little meaning without equality and equality has little meaning without social justice&quot; and committed himself to combating terrorism, poverty, disease and communalism in India. The validity of the election was challenged unsuccessfully before the Supreme Court of India.

=== Narasimha Rao government (1992–1996) ===
Sharma&#x27;s victory was seen as a victory for the Congress party and Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao who headed a minority government. Although seen as a largely ceremonial post, the office of the president is key since the incumbent gets to nominate a head of government in the event of no party gaining a majority in Parliament after national elections or after a government had lost a vote of confidence. The Rao ministry faced three no-confidence motions during its tenure the third of which, held in July 1993, was marred by allegations of bribery and subsequent criminal indictment against Rao himself.On 6 December 1992, the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished by a fanatic Hindu mob which led to widespread rioting across India. Sharma expressed his deep anguish and pain at the demolition and condemned the action as being contrary to the traditional ethos of India of respecting all religions and as opposed to the precepts of Hinduism. Sharma&#x27;s strong condemnation of the incident forced the Rao government to dismiss the state government and impose President&#x27;s rule in Uttar Pradesh, the state in which Ayodhya is located, the same evening. The following day, the Government of India, by way of a presidential ordinance, acquired of land in and around the spot where the mosque had stood and provided that all litigation relating to the disputed area would stand dissolved following the acquisition. In January 1993, a reference was made by Sharma to India&#x27;s Supreme Court as to whether a Hindu temple or religious structure had existed prior to the construction of the Babri Masjid at the disputed area where the mosque stood. In 1994, by a majority decision, the Court refused to answer the reference as it held it to be contrary to the spirit of secularism and likely to favour a religious community.

In 1995, Sharma dedicated to the Indian people the reconstructed Somnath temple in Gujarat. At the dedication ceremony, Sharma stated that all religions taught the same lesson of unity and placed humanism above all else. The construction of the temple had lasted for fifty years. Questions about its financing, the role of the state in its reconstruction and the presence of constitutional functionaries during the installation of the idol had been marked by debates on secularism in the years following India&#x27;s independence. The same year, even as the Narasimha Rao government dithered on acting against Sheila Kaul, the governor of Himachal Pradesh, after the Supreme Court expressed its concern that she was using her gubernatorial immunity to avoid criminal proceedings, Sharma forced the government to get her to resign immediately.

Sharma largely enjoyed cordial ties with Narasimha Rao government. In 1996, however, two ordinances sent to him by the Rao government seeking to extend the benefits of reservations in state employment and education for Christian and Muslim Dalits and to reduce the time allowed for campaigning in elections, were returned by Sharma on the grounds that elections were imminent and therefore such decisions should be left to the incoming government.

=== Vajpayee government (16 May 1996 – 28 May 1996) ===
In the general elections of 1996, no party got a majority in Parliament but the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged the largest party winning 160 seats out of 543. The ruling Congress party came second with 139 seats. On 15 May 1996, Sharma invited Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as the leader of the single largest party, to be the prime minister on the condition that he prove his majority on the floor of the house before 31 May. Vajpayee and a cabinet of 11 ministers were sworn in the following day. President Sharma addressed the new parliament on 24 May. The motion for vote of confidence was taken up and discussed on 27 and 28 May. However, before the motion could be put to vote, Vajpayee announced his resignation. The government lasted only 13 days, the shortest in India&#x27;s history.

President Sharma&#x27;s decision of selecting Vajpayee as prime minister drew criticism from several quarters. Unlike presidents Ramaswamy Venkataraman or Neelam Sanjiva Reddy who had asked prime ministerial candidates to produce lists of their supporting MPs, thus satisfying themselves that the prime ministers appointed would be able to win a vote of confidence, Sharma had made no such demands of Vajpayee and had appointed him solely by the principle of inviting the leader of the largest party in Parliament. Also, unlike President Venkataraman, Sharma issued no press communiqués outlining the rationale for his decision. The Communist parties criticized Sharma&#x27;s decision as he had been elected president with their backing but had chosen to invite their ideological opponent to be the prime minister.

Sharma&#x27;s decision to invite Vajpayee has been attributed to the fact that no party had staked their claim to form the government and the United Front, a coalition of thirteen parties, took time to decide on their leader and in getting the Congress party to extend its support to them. Sharma&#x27;s deadline of two weeks given to Vajpayee to prove his majority was much shorter than the time given to prime ministers in previous instances and was a move to discourage horse trading.

=== Deve Gowda government (1996–1997) ===
Following Vajpayee&#x27;s resignation, Sharma asked him to continue as caretaker prime minister and appointed H. D. Deve Gowda as prime minister on 28 May 1996 after being assured of the support of the Congress party for his candidature. Gowda and a 21 member council of ministers sworn in on 1 June and won a vote of confidence within the deadline of twelve days set by Sharma. Gowda, a former chief minister of Karnataka, was India&#x27;s third prime minister in as many weeks and headed a diverse coalition comprising regional parties, leftists and lower caste Hindu politicians. He was also India&#x27;s first prime minister not conversant in its official language, Hindi. The government lasted ten months and was dependent on the Congress party which, under its new president Sitaram Kesri, withdrew support in April 1997 alleging failure on the part of the prime minister in preventing the growth of Hindu nationalist political parties in North India. Sharma then directed Gowda to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament.

<text>John Lafayette Camp (February 20, 1828 – July 16, 1891) was an American lawyer and planter from Texas who served in the Texas state Senate and as a district court judge.

John was born in Jefferson County, Alabama, the son of John and Elizabeth Camp. After graduating from the University of Tennessee in 1848 he moved to Gilmer in Upshur County, Texas. He started a plantation and was admitted to the bar. In 1851 he married Mary Ann Ward, the daughter of a local doctor. The couple would have five children, including John Lafayette, Jr.

==Civil war==
Camp entered to Civil War by joining the Confederate States Army. He joined the 14th Texas Cavalry Regiment and was elected Captain of his company. By the end of the war, he was Colonel of the 10th Texas Cavalry, and attached to the Army of Tennessee. He was in actions at Cumberland Gap, Murfreesboro, and Chickamauga. John was wounded and captured twice.

==Political career==
In 1866, the first district in Texas elected Camp to the U.S. Congress. However, in the struggle over seating of delegations connected with the Reconstruction, he was not allowed to take his seat. He remained active in Democratic Party politics.

Camp was elected to the Texas State Senate in 1874, and served from 1875 to 1878, when Governor Hubbard appointed him a judge in State district court. He resigned as a judge in 1878 due to poor health.

==Later life==
Camp moved to Arizona in 1884, working as a registrar in the land office. But, when the drier climate failed to improve his health, he came back to Texas two years later. He settled in San Antonio, living in his later years with his son, John Lafayette Camp, Jr. He died there in 1891.

Camp County, Texas was named for him after he introduced the Bill in the state Senate that created the county.

<doc id="996094" wikidata="Q4996924" url="?curid=996094" title="Bullies (film)">
<text>Bullies is a 1986 Canadian action drama film directed by Paul Lynch and starring Jonathan Crombie, Janet-Laine Green, Stephen Hunter, and Olivia d&#x27;Abo. In a story that has elicited occasional comparisons to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, a vendetta arises from the forbidden relationship between a teenage girl, whose clan terrorizes a small town, and the son of a newly arrived family. The film received polarized reviews, which often praised its craftsmanship while questioning the ethics of its vigilante violence.

==Plot==
When the peaceful Morris family move to a small town and buy the town grocery store, they run afoul of the Cullen family. The Cullen&#x27;s have been bullying the town&#x27;s folk for years, and now they are harassing the Morris family every chance they get. Matt meanwhile meets and starts seeing a lot of Becky who also likes him. Unfortunately her last name is Cullen, and when the rest of the family finds out about their relationship, they decide to get even, and their harassment is elevated to vicious assault.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Bullies&quot; was part of a three-project slate made by Toronto-based Simcom in Western Canada in late 1985, under the legal entity Bullies Productions. Also included were the miniseries &quot;Mania&quot; and the feature &quot;High Stakes&quot;, which started filming right as &quot;Bullies&quot; ended. British Columbia Television and Allarcom of Alberta were the other main partners in the venture (the latter only on &quot;Bullies&quot; and &quot;Mania&quot;). In pre-production, the film&#x27;s budget was pegged at slightly less than CAD$2 million, but the final cost was estimated at 2.7 million. Telefilm Canada, the government agency responsible for supporting the national film industry, refused to contribute to &quot;Bullies&quot;″ financing due to its perceived exploitative content.

According to director Paul Lynch, the film was not inspired by the likes of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, to which it has frequently been compared. Rather, it existed as a counterpoint to Simcom&#x27;s early family adventure films, where rurality offered a peaceful setting for families in need of rebuilding. Although the casting of Jonathan Crombie, son of acting Canadian minister David Crombie, attracted some curiosity, Lynch&#x27;s intention was actually to use lesser known actors, as he felt that it had helped similar films such as &quot;The Ransom&quot; and &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; to maximize their visceral impact. Olivia d&#x27;Abo was a favorite of the director, and had already worked for him and writer John Sheppard on 1985&#x27;s &quot;Flying&quot;.

&quot;Bullies&quot; was filmed in the town of Kimberley and at Thunder Hill Provincial Park, both in British Columbia. Photography began on September 23 and concluded on November 3, 1985. Veteran genre director John &quot;Bud&quot; Cardos helmed the second unit. Like many Simcom films, it underwent a few reshoots, which were done in Toronto. American actor Dehl Berti did not participate, and a casting call was instead published in the local press for a lookalike who could appear in some non-dialogue pick-up shots.

==Release==
===Pre-release===
&quot;Bullies&quot; was Canada&#x27;s biggest sales success at the 1986 Cannes Film Market, and its U.S. rights were sold to Universal Pictures for CAD$4 million. Again due to the film&#x27;s violence, Norstar&#x27;s distribution arm Norstar Releasing was refused marketing subsidies by Telefilm Canada.

===Theatrical===
&quot;Bullies&quot; arrived in Canadian and U.S. theaters on the same day of August 29, 1986. In Canada, it was released by Norstar Releasing though Cineplex Odeon Theatres. In the U.S., it was distributed by Universal Pictures, in what appears to have been a hybrid release where the film, while available in most markets, only received a limited number of screens in some major agglomerations like Los Angeles. &quot;Bullies&quot; opened in 13th place at the box office, grossing US$1,532,605 during Labor Day Weekend, and finishing its run with a tally of US$2,995,527.

===Home media===
The film was released on U.S. VHS on March 12, 1987, via MCA Home Video. The following month, MCA issued a LaserDisc pressing, while Simcom&#x27;s sister company Norstar Home Video put out the Canadian tape.

==Reception==
&quot;Bullies&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews. Michael H. Price of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; wrote that when it comes to vigilantism, &quot;few filmmakers have the savvy to treat the issue responsibly. Add the Canadian-made &quot;Bullies&quot; to the list of films that approach that turf with confidence and solid judgment.&quot; He also praised Crombie, whose &quot;transformation bears favorable comparisons with that of Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; also likened the climax to that of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, judging that it &quot;shares some of that film&#x27;s primal power.&quot; Although unimpressed by tropes like a &quot;wise old Indian&quot;, he granted that Lynch &quot;is competent with action&quot; and &quot;&quot;Bullies&quot; has its moments.&quot; Barbara Vancheri of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote that the revenge angle was &quot;well executed with suspense and a heavy dose of blood and violence&quot;, adding that amateurs of the genre &quot;should like this action-adventure film&quot;. Alex Grant of &quot;The Province&quot; acknowledged &quot;a series of sadistic setpieces&quot;, yet found that &quot;&quot;Bullies&quot; brazenly delivers the goods&quot; thanks to a &quot;handsome look and punchy style&quot;, making it &quot;easy to see why&quot; a U.S. major would acquire it. Mike Mayo of the &quot;Roanoke Times&quot; wrote that &quot;people have spent a lot more money and told the same story not nearly as well.&quot; He deemed it &quot;intense enough to satisfy fans of action movies and to disgust those who don&#x27;t care for this kind of things.&quot;

Bruce Bailey of &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; found the film representative of producer Peter R. Simpson&#x27;s commercial product, balking at the premise that &quot;to beat a homicidal maniac, you&#x27;ve got to act like a homicidal maniac&quot;, but accepting that &quot;some of the scenes are pretty effective in a sick sort of way&quot; and that &quot;it looks like they put considerable thought into orchestrating the rhythm and impact of the mayhem.&quot; James Adams of the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; opined that &quot;Bullies&quot; occasionally appeared to have &quot;satirical tendencies&quot;, but was ultimately &quot;a movie with too little wit and irony, too much blood &#x27;n&#x27; guts, a movie that revels in its cliches, in its nasty depiction of murder and primal mayhem.&quot; He concluded that &quot;[s]ocially redeeming, &quot;Bullies&quot; is not. But it does carry a visceral charge, and it&#x27;s a movie that will likely make most of its moolah in the blood-and-thrills video market.&quot; Joel Rubinoff of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; was along the same lines, writing that there was something &quot;strangely reassuring&quot; about the film&#x27;s exploitation formula and that the action was directed &quot;with style and gusto&quot;, positing that &quot;while &quot;Bullies&quot;″ stay in movie theatres may be short, it will likely clean up in video sales&quot;.

David Barber of the &quot;The Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; deemed that the story appeared &quot;lifted from the pages of old comic books everywhere&quot;, but with &quot;a darker tone, one disturbing in its nonchalant acceptance of retributive violence&quot;. He summed up &quot;Bullies&quot; as &quot;the sort of movie Ronald Reagan might have written in his spare time&quot;. Dale Stevens of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; found it to be &quot;one of the more ugly, unpleasant films of the last decade&quot;. He declared: &quot;In general, I feel the public should make up its own mind about whether it should see certain things. This one, however, deserves a warning. It is a mean-spirited, dim-witted and made by people who think the public will accept any trashy film. Don&#x27;t go.&quot; Robert Garrett of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s &quot;exercise in sadism&quot; and decreed that &quot;it belongs under a stone, from where it seems to have crawled&quot;. Christopher Harris of &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote that &quot;Lynch seems to have the talent to sustain suspense [but] this feeble movie is so overcome by its own welter of blood and savagery that it becomes a monster of violence&quot;. He assessed that, while the director may have sought to emulate &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;all he&#x27;s done is add one more pulpy B-movie to the list of Canadian cinema flops.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The end credit song &quot;Out of the Fire&quot; was co-written by Simcom boss and music enthusiast Peter R. Simpson. It was penned for the film and performed at composer Paul Zaza&#x27;s studio by Canadian singer Patti Jannetta, who was made aware of the story&#x27;s themes to inform her performance.

<text>Sentence extraction is a technique used for automatic summarization of a text.
In this shallow approach, statistical heuristics are used to identify the most salient sentences of a text. Sentence extraction is a low-cost approach compared to more knowledge-intensive deeper approaches which require additional knowledge bases such as ontologies or linguistic knowledge. In short, sentence extraction works as a filter that allows only meaningful sentences to pass.

The major downside of applying sentence-extraction techniques to the task of summarization is the loss of coherence in the resulting summary. 
Nevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers.

== Procedure ==
Usually, a combination of heuristics is used to determine the most important sentences within the document. Each heuristic assigns a (positive or negative) score to the sentence. After all heuristics have been applied, the highest-scoring sentences are included in the summary.
The individual heuristics are weighted according to their importance.

=== Early approaches and some sample heuristics ===
Seminal papers which laid the foundations for many techniques used today have been published by Hans Peter Luhn in 1958 and H. P Edmundson in 1969.

Luhn proposed to assign more weight to sentences at the beginning of the document or a paragraph.
Edmundson stressed the importance of title-words for summarization and was the first to employ stop-lists in order to filter uninformative words of low semantic content (e.g. most grammatical words such as &quot;of&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;). He also distinguished between bonus words and stigma words, i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form &quot;significant&quot;) or unimportant information.
His idea of using key-words, i.e. words which occur significantly frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today&#x27;s summarizers. With large linguistic corpora available today, the tf–idf value which originated in information retrieval, can be successfully applied to identify the key words of a text: If for example the word &quot;cat&quot; occurs significantly more often in the text to be summarized (TF = &quot;term frequency&quot;) than in the corpus (IDF means &quot;inverse document frequency&quot;; here the corpus is meant by &quot;document&quot;), then &quot;cat&quot; is likely to be an important word of the text; the text may in fact be a text about cats.

<text>Yulin (, ), alternately romanized as Watlam, is one of the fourteen prefecture-level cities of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its Chinese name was changed in 1956 from the historical name &quot; (), which is homophonous in Standard Mandarin, but different in the local dialect of Yue Chinese; &quot; is while &quot;&quot; is . The former romanization follows the pronunciation of the historical name in Yue Chinese. Its built-up area is made of two urban districts, and Beiliu City was home to 2,438,467 inhabitants as of 2020 census.

==Geography and climate==

Yulin is located in southeastern Guangxi province along the border with Guangdong. It is a hilly basin with a total area of .

Yulin&#x27;s climate is subtropical and monsoonal. Average annual temperatures is 22.9 °C. Yearly precipitation is 1,577 mm. 

==History==
Artifacts suggest that the area was settled before the Qin dynasty but a commandery by the name of Yulin was not established until early Han dynasty. The urban centre of Yulin became a &quot;zhou&quot; in 996 AD. Since ancient times, Yulin has been important for trade and communications between central China and the south, especially along the coast of the Tonkin Gulf.

==Administration==
Yulin has two districts, one city, four counties, and 119 towns and townships.

Districts:
*Yuzhou District ()
*Fumian District ()

County-level City:
*Beiliu City ()

Counties:
*Rong County ()
*Luchuan County ()
*Bobai County ()
*Xingye County ()

Demographics:
*As of the 2020 Chinese census, its total population was 5,796,766 inhabitants and its built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made of two urban districts and Beiliu City was home to 2,438,467 inhabitants. The majority of Yulin&#x27;s population is Han but also includes Zhuang, Miao, and other ethnic minorities, totaling more than 100,000 people.

==Language==
Some Chinese linguists have suggested that the Yulin dialect is the best surviving example of what ancient spoken Chinese would have sounded like based on rhyme patterns in Tang dynasty poetry.

==Dog meat festival==

Yulin is also infamous for its annual dog meat and lychee festival which takes place on 21 June, over the course of 10 days or so. Over 10,000 dogs are slaughtered at this festival for human consumption. The festival also includes consuming cat and lychee. Despite ongoing protests inside and outside of China, dogs are still seen as livestock.

==Economy==
Yulin is rich in natural resources. Important mineral resources include granite, limestone, iron, and gemstones. It is also Guangxi&#x27;s biggest source of porcelain clay. Major agricultural products are rice, bananas, tomatoes, mandarin oranges, mangoes, longan, anise, tea, sugarcane, livestock such as cattle, pigs, geese, chickens and dogs. Industrial goods include machinery, construction materials, processed food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, and ceramics.

==Transportation==
Yulin is where the G59 Hohhot–Beihai Expressway and G80 Guangzhou–Kunming Expressway intersect, and there are also provincial highways and &quot;not tolled&quot; roads available.

Yulin is served by Yulin railway station, which sees both high-speed and conventional services. Typical trains take approximately 2 hours to reach Nanning.

Yulin is served by Yulin Fumian Airport, which opened in August 2020.

==Education==
Yulin is home to Yulin Normal University, where there are 13 departments with 38 four-year undergraduate specialties, 14 three-year specialties, more than 17,200 students including 12,000 full-time students and 5,200 higher education students.

Guangxi Yulin High School is a high-level key middle school in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and an advanced unit of national spiritual civilization construction. It is also the first demonstration ordinary high school in Guangxi.

<doc id="996107" wikidata="Q2495664" url="?curid=996107" title="Universal coefficient theorem">
<text>In algebraic topology, universal coefficient theorems establish relationships between homology groups (or cohomology groups) with different coefficients. For instance, for every topological space , its &quot;integral homology groups&quot;:

:formula_1

completely determine its &quot;homology groups with coefficients in&quot; , for any abelian group :

:formula_2

Here formula_3 might be the simplicial homology, or more generally the singular homology. The usual proof of this result is a pure piece of homological algebra about chain complexes of free abelian groups. The form of the result is that other coefficients may be used, at the cost of using a Tor functor.

For example, it is common to take formula_4 to be formula_5, so that coefficients are modulo 2. This becomes straightforward in the absence of 2-torsion in the homology. Quite generally, the result indicates the relationship that holds between the Betti numbers formula_6 of formula_7 and the Betti numbers formula_8 with coefficients in a field formula_9. These can differ, but only when the characteristic of formula_9 is a prime number formula_11 for which there is some formula_11-torsion in the homology.

==Statement of the homology case ==
Consider the tensor product of modules formula_13. The theorem states there is a short exact sequence involving the Tor functor 

:formula_14

Furthermore, this sequence splits, though not naturally. Here formula_15 is the map induced by the bilinear map formula_16.
If the coefficient ring formula_4 is formula_18, this is a special case of the Bockstein spectral sequence.

==Universal coefficient theorem for cohomology==
Let formula_19 be a module over a principal ideal domain formula_20 (for example formula_21, or any field.)

There is a universal coefficient theorem for cohomology involving the Ext functor, which asserts that there is a natural short exact sequence

:formula_22

As in the homology case, the sequence splits, though not naturally. In fact, suppose

:formula_23

and define

:formula_24

Then formula_25 above is the canonical map:

:formula_26

An alternative point of view can be based on representing cohomology via Eilenberg–MacLane space, where the map formula_25 takes a homotopy class of maps formula_28 to the corresponding homomorphism induced in homology. Thus, the Eilenberg–MacLane space is a &quot;weak right adjoint&quot; to the homology functor.

== Example: mod 2 cohomology of the real projective space==
Let formula_29, the real projective space. We compute the singular cohomology of formula_7 with coefficients in formula_31 using integral homology, i.e., formula_32.

Knowing that the integer homology is given by:

:formula_33 and formula_34, so that the above exact sequences yield
:formula_35
for all formula_36. In fact the total cohomology ring structure is

:formula_37

==Corollaries==
A special case of the theorem is computing integral cohomology. For a finite CW complex formula_7, formula_1 is finitely generated, and so we have the following decomposition.

:formula_40

where formula_41 are the Betti numbers of formula_7 and formula_43 is the torsion part of formula_3. One may check that

:formula_45

and

:formula_46

This gives the following statement for integral cohomology:

:formula_47

For formula_7 an orientable, closed, and connected formula_49-manifold, this corollary coupled with Poincaré duality gives that formula_50.

== Universal coefficient spectral sequence ==

There is a generalization of the universal coefficient theorem for (co)homology with twisted coefficients.

For cohomology we have 

:formula_51

where formula_20 is a ring with unit, formula_53 is a chain complex of free modules over formula_20, formula_19 is any formula_56-bimodule for some ring with a unit formula_57, and formula_58 is the Ext group. The differential formula_59 has degree formula_60.

Similarly for homology,
:formula_61
for formula_62 the Tor group and the differential formula_63 having degree formula_64.

<text>Lake Ilmen (, ) is a large lake in Novgorod Oblast, Russia. A historically important lake, it formed a vital part of the medieval trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. The city of Veliky Novgorod, which is a major trade center of the route, lies below the lake&#x27;s sole outflow, via the Volkhov River.

According to Max Vasmer&#x27;s &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot;, the name of the lake originates from Finnic &quot;Ilmajärvi&quot;, which means &quot;air lake&quot;. Thanks to Novgorodian colonisation, many lakes in Russia have names deriving from Lake Ilmen. Yuri Otkupshchikov has argued that the presence of the name &quot;Ilmen&quot; in Southern Russia cannot be explained by Novgorodian colonisation alone, and proposed a Slavic etymology instead.

The average surface area of the lake is (it may vary between and depending on water level). The lake is fed by 52 inflowing rivers, the four main ones being the Msta, the Pola, the Lovat, and the Shelon. It is drained through a single outlet, the Volkhov, into Lake Ladoga, and subsequently via the Neva into the Gulf of Finland. The source of the Volkhov is marked by the Peryn Chapel built in the 1220s.

The basin of Lake Ilmen contains vast areas in Novgorod, Pskov, and Tver Oblasts of Russia, as well as minor areas in the north of Vitebsk Region in Belarus.

The water level is regulated by the Volkhov hydroelectric plant situated downstream the Volkhov River. Water temperature in July is 19-20 °C. The bathing season is about 90 days.

Lake Ilmen is navigable. Shipping lines are Veliky Novgorod – Staraya Russa and Veliky Novgorod – Shimsk. There is a fishery in the lake.

The lake area was the location of an important battle during World War II, the Demyansk Pocket.

<text>Basil of Ostrog (, ; 28 December 1610 – 29 April 1671), also known as Vasilije, was a Serbian Orthodox bishop of Zahumlje who is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Stojan Jovanović () was born on 28 December 1610, in the village of Mrkonjići at the Popovo field in the Ljubinje nahija (Herzegovina), at the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His father was Petar Stojanović and his mother was Ana. Legends about him describe him as a diligent and obedient child, saying he inherited his graciousness and benevolence from his parents.

Having raised cattle on the Herzegovinian hills and mountain slopes, he shared all of his food with poorer people. The Ottomans started to notice him and his parents took him to the nearby Zavala Monastery, where his paternal uncle, the hieromonk Serafim served as the hegumen of the monastery. There, he would study and be protected.

=== Studies ===
At that time, the monastery had a large library at the monastery church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He quickly became a master of the Bible and basic Christian mysteries. After a while, his uncle sent him to the Monastery of the Most Holy Mother of God, the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, for further spiritual and theological studies.

=== Bishop of Zahumlje ===
St. Basil&#x27;s modesty made him reluctant to occupy high positions. However, his dedication to the Church led to his election as Bishop of Zahumlje and Skenderija in 1639. He retired from the position in 1649.

== Legacy ==

After his death in 1671, he was buried at the Ostrog Monastery which he had founded in Montenegro. His tomb in a cave-church soon became a site of pilgrimage for Christians (both Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and Muslims who were drawn by reports of miracles occurring through the intercession of the saint. The Monastery is now one of the major pilgrimage sites in the Balkans, and large numbers of pilgrims gather, particularly at Pentecost. St. Basil of Ostrog is commemorated in the Serbian orthodox liturgical calendar on April 29 (May 12 in the Gregorian Calendar).

The Orthodox seminary in East Sarajevo (), part of the University of East Sarajevo, is named after him.

A church in Nalježići, in the Grbalj region is also named after him.

Vladimir Kecmanović wrote the poem &quot;Ognjen i kelija&quot; (2024), inspired by the life of Basil of Ostrog.

<doc id="996119" wikidata="Q5190161" url="?curid=996119" title="Crusaders (DC Comics)">
<text>The Crusaders is a team of DC Comics superheroes. The team was created by Bob Rozakis and Dick Ayers in the pages of &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; #7 (March 1977). 

They were based on the Invaders and part of an unofiical crossover.

==Fictional team history==
The Crusaders were a metafictional team of superheroes appearing in comic books on Earth-One during World War II.

The Crusaders appeared &quot;for real&quot; on Earth-One during the 1970s, offering their services to New York City District Attorney David Pearson to help capture the Freedom Fighters, who were at that time fugitives because they were believed to have been working with the villainous Silver Ghost. Pearson gave the Crusaders the authority to pursue Uncle Sam and his group after a report that they had caused a blackout in upstate New York.

After a lengthy fight, at the end of which the Crusaders are defeated, the Freedom Fighters ask the Crusaders how they became the comic book heroes of World War II. The group revealed that the Americommando had approached a group of young comic book collectors at a convention (Marvin, Lennie, Arch, and Roy) and had offered to recreate them as his former teammates, using a special device to transform them into their superpowered identities.

Meanwhile, the others had caught up to the Americommando and Martha Roberts. The villain dropped Martha, but the Ray was able to save her. He left Martha with Doll Man and headed off after the Americommando. The Ray again caught up with him and the sky battle between them burned off the Americommando&#x27;s mask, revealing him to indeed be the Silver Ghost. The fight also attracted the attention of some state trooper helicopters, which swooped in to arrest both of them. The Ray accidentally hit one of the helicopters with an energy blast, prompting the troopers to open fire. The Ray was wounded and fell to Earth. The Silver Ghost gloated and left him to die.

The Ray was later rescued by Rod Reilly, the Golden Age Firebrand, who had emigrated to Earth-One some time prior to the Freedom Fighters.

The Crusaders fought among themselves until finally, after being deserted by the Americommando, they reveal their origins. They disappeared at the end of the story and there was no sign that they have lost their powers, but they never appear again. There was never an explanation of how the Silver Ghost gained super-strength or developed the technology to turn comic fans into superheroes.

==Members==
The Crusaders only appeared in &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; #7–9. The names of the team are actually taken from obscure Golden Age superheroes:
* The Americommando – in actuality the Silver Ghost.
* Barracuda
* Fireball
* Rusty
* Sparky

Updated versions of the Americommando and Barracuda have since appeared in the miniseries &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; (2006–2007), as part of the team called First Strike. It is unknown if their Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; history is still canonical.

In &quot;Lord Havok and the Extremists&quot;, Barracuda and the Americommando are also members of Earth-8&#x27;s Meta-Militia, an updated version of the Champions of Angor.

In the 2007–2008 &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; series, a new team of Crusaders, gathered and controlled by the government, were introduced, including Captain Triumph, Citizen X, the Libertine, and Magno. After they are freed from their mind-controlled state, they team up with Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters. Citizen X and the Libertine are killed by alien insects, but Captain Triumph and Magno both go on to continue their superhero careers.

<text>The Platform is the debut studio album by American hip hop trio Dilated Peoples. It was released on May 23, 2000, through Capitol Records. The recording sessions took place at Audio X in Burbank, D&amp;D Studios in New York, Can Am Studios in Tarzana and Threshold Studios in Santa Monica. The album was produced by members Evidence and DJ Babu, as well as Alchemist, Joey Chavez, E-Swift, KutMasta Kurt, and T-Ray. It features guest appearances from Aceyalone, B-Real, Everlast, and Likwit Crew members Defari, Phil Da Agony, Planet Asia, and tha Alkaholiks. The album represents a movement of several California underground hip hop artists away from the violence and misogyny of gangsta rap, towards a more traditional, conscious form of rap.

The album debuted at number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 30 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States. It also made it to number 89 on the UK Albums Chart and number 14 on the UK Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums Chart. The title track peaked at number 81 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;The Platform&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on eleven reviews.

AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey praised the album, saying &quot;the most alluring aspect of &quot;The Platform&quot; is the array of finely-crafted beats&quot;. Frank Tope of &quot;Q&quot; gave the album mixed review: &quot;their debut album sits comfortably between the party-heart, old skool shape-throwing of Jurassic Five and the darker weedscapes of Cypress Hill&quot;. Rob Sheffield for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 2 out of 5 possible stars, saying &quot;Dilated Peoples are still painfully tame on the mike, especially Evidence, who hits a dubious milestone in &quot;The Platform&quot; by becoming the first rapper ever to utter the words &quot;between you and I&quot;. The vocals sink the music: This is the kind of hip-hop album where the MC compares himself to Steve Howe, and while you hope he means the baseball player, you know in your heart he really means the guitarist from Yes&quot;. Veteran critic Robert Christgau picked out two songs—&quot;The Platform&quot; and &quot;Triple Optics&quot;—as choice cuts at his Consumer Guide column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

MTV named the album &quot;one of those timeless long-players, like Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;Raising Hell&quot; or EPMD&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, where you&#x27;ll want to commit every track to memory&quot;. CDNow description was &quot;the most alluring aspect of &quot;The Platform&quot; is the array of finely-crafted beats assembled by Evidence and DJ Premier protégé The Alchemist, which are in turn juggled and sliced at will by the hands of DJ Babu, the oft-forgotten man in the hip-hop equation&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;a balanced, lyrically inspiring collection of songs&quot;. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the album &quot;would benefit from greater lyrical diversity, and it suffers from moments of monotony and inertia, but it&#x27;s a promising debut from a group that should only improve with time&quot;. Wall of Sound reviewer found the album &quot;for all its individual strengths, never hits any kind of synergy as an album&quot;.

<text>The Morant Bay Rebellion (11 October 1865) began with a protest march to the courthouse by hundreds of people led by preacher Paul Bogle in Morant Bay, Jamaica. Some were armed with sticks and stones. After seven men were shot and killed by the volunteer militia, the protesters attacked and burned the courthouse and nearby buildings. Twenty-five people died. Over the next two days, poor freedmen rose in rebellion across most of St. Thomas-in-the-East parish.

The Jamaicans were protesting against injustice and widespread poverty. Most freedmen were prevented from voting by high poll taxes, and their living conditions had worsened following crop damage by floods, cholera and smallpox epidemics, and a long drought. A few days before the march, when police tried to arrest a man for disrupting a trial, a fight broke out against them by spectators. Officials then issued a warrant for the arrest of preacher Bogle, who had called for reforms, and was charged with inciting to riot.

Governor Edward John Eyre declared martial law in the area, ordering in troops to hunt down the rebels. They killed many black individuals with an initial death toll of more than 400. Troops arrested more than 300 persons, including Bogle. Many of these were also innocent but were quickly tried and executed under martial law; both men and women were punished by whipping and long sentences. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies. The governor had George William Gordon, a mixed-race representative of the parish in the House of Assembly, arrested in Kingston and brought back to Morant Bay, where he tried the politician under martial law. Gordon was quickly convicted and executed. 
The violent suppression and numerous executions generated a fierce debate in England, with some protesting about the unconstitutional actions of the governor John Eyre, and others praising him for his response to a crisis. The rebellion and its suppression remain controversial, and it is frequently discussed by specialists in black and colonial studies.

==Background==
Slavery in Jamaica was abolished on 1 August 1834 with the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act. The act also stipulated that all formerly enslaved persons in Jamaica over the age of six would work as apprentices for a period of four to six years for their former enslavers, though British abolitionists protested against the apprenticeship system and it was fully abolished by 1 August 1838.

This date marked the start of Jamaicans formerly in the apprenticeship system being allowed to choose their employer and profession; though they also gained the right to vote, most Jamaicans could not afford to pay the poll tax required to participate in Jamaica&#x27;s political system. The poll tax was introduced by the colonial government to disfranchise the majority of emancipated Jamaicans, being fearful of causing an anti-colonial uprising (such as the Haitian Revolution) if they granted too much political power.

==Tensions in the 1860s==
During the election of 1864, fewer than 2,000 black Jamaican men were eligible to vote (no women could vote at the time) out of a total population of more than 436,000, in which blacks outnumbered whites by a ratio of 32:1. Prior to the rebellion, conditions in Jamaica had been worsening for poor blacks. In 1864 there were several floods that ruined many crops, while 1865 marked the end of a decade in which the island had been overwhelmed by plagues of cholera and smallpox. A two-year drought preceding 1865 made economic conditions worse for much of the population of survivors of slavery and their descendants. Several bankruptcies were declared in the sugar industry, causing a loss of jobs and widening the economic void.

Tensions between white planters and black Jamaicans increased, and rumours began circulating among the freedmen that white planters intended to restore slavery. Gordon criticized Eyre&#x27;s draconian punishments such as flogging and the treadmill for crimes such as stealing food. He warned that &quot;If we are to be governed by such a Governor much longer, the people will have to fly to arms and become self-governing.&quot;

In 1865, Dr. Edward Underhill, Secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society of Great Britain, wrote a letter to the Colonial Office in London in order to describe Jamaica&#x27;s poor state of affairs for the mass of people. This letter was later shown to Jamaica&#x27;s Governor John Eyre, who immediately tried to deny the truth of its statements. Jamaica&#x27;s poor black people learned of the letter and began organizing in &quot;Underhill Meetings&quot;. Peasants in Saint Ann parish sent a petition to Queen Victoria asking for Crown lands to cultivate, saying they could not find land for themselves. The petition was sent to Eyre first, and he enclosed a letter with his own comments.

The Queen&#x27;s reply was made known, and many of the poor believed that Eyre had influenced her opinion: she encouraged the poor to work harder, rather than offering any help. Gordon, who was one of two representatives from the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East, began encouraging the people in his parish to find ways to make their grievances known.

One of his followers was a black Baptist deacon named Paul Bogle. In August 1865 Bogle led a deputation of peasants from St. Thomas-in-the-East an 87 kilometer (55 mile) march to the capital, Spanish Town, hoping to meet with the governor, John Eyre to discuss issues. But the governor refused to receive them.

==Rebellion and response==

On 7 October 1865, a black man was put on trial in the Morant Bay courthouse, charged with trespassing on a long-abandoned sugar plantation. The poor black Jamaicans of the parish were angered by this additional example of land inequality, and marched on the courthouse under the leadership of Bogle. Although the march was peaceful, the proceedings were disrupted when James Geoghegon, a black spectator, angrily denounced the charges. In the police&#x27;s attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, two policemen were beaten with sticks and stones thrown from the crowd. The trial continued and Geoghegon was convicted and imprisoned. The following Monday the court issued arrest warrants for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among those warrants was one issued directing the arrest of preacher Paul Bogle. The police were unable to arrest Bogle because of interference by his followers.

A few days later on 11 October, Bogle, this time with hundreds of Jamaican peasant-labourers, again marched to Morant Bay. The marchers had taken oaths, to &quot;cleave to the black and leave the white&quot;, a sign that they were preparing for insurrection, or so Gad Heuman argues, indicating that oath taking in African tradition was a way to bring the group together and prepare for war.

When the group arrived at the courthouse in Morant Bay, they were met by local officials and a small and inexperienced volunteer militia, gathered from personnel from the plantations. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the protesters. This angered the crowd, who reacted violently, burning the court house and nearby buildings. More than 25 people were killed on both sides, before the militia retreated. For the next two days, the mass of rebellious black peasants took over the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East.

In response, Governor John Eyre sent government troops, under Brigadier-General Alexander Nelson, to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organized resistance, but they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in either the riot at the courthouse or the later rebellion. Amongst the rebels shot or hanged with only perfunctory trial, or no trial at all, were seven women of colour – Letitia Geoghegan, Mary Ann Francis, Judy Edwards, Ellen Dawkins, Justina Taylor, Sarah Francis and Mary Ward. Heuman has described it as a reign of terror. The Jamaican Maroons of Moore Town, under the command of former Charles Town superintendent Alexander Fyfe, committed a number of atrocities and extrajudicial murders before they captured and arrested Bogle, and delivered him to the colonial authorities.

Believing that the blacks could not have planned such events themselves (as he shared the widespread white assumption of the time that they were not capable of it), Governor John Eyre had representative George William Gordon arrested. The mixed-race Jamaican businessman and politician was wealthy and well-known; he was openly critical of the governor and his policies. Eyre believed that Gordon had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was quickly convicted and executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, where martial law had not been declared, Eyre had him transferred to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under martial law.

The trial and execution of Gordon via martial law, following the excesses of suppressing the rebellion, added to the outrage felt by many in Britain. They felt there were serious constitutional issues by Eyre&#x27;s bringing Gordon under martial law. They were concerned about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license. With a speedy trial, Gordon was convicted quickly and hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun.

According to one soldier, &quot;we slaughtered all before us ... man or woman or child&quot;. In the end, the soldiers killed 439 black Jamaicans directly, and they arrested 354 more (including Paul Bogle) who were later executed, many without proper trials. Bogle was executed &quot;either the same evening he was tried or the next morning&quot;. On 25 October, Bogle was hanged alongside 14 others, including his brother Moses.

Other punishments included flogging of more than 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. The soldiers burned thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans without any justifiable reason, leaving families homeless throughout the parish. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies, exceeding incidents during slavery years.

==Aftermath==

===Consequences in Britain===
When news of the Jamaican government&#x27;s response to the rebellion broke in Britain, with hundreds killed and hundreds more arrested and being executed, it generated fierce debate. Public figures of different political affiliations lined up to support or oppose Governor Eyre&#x27;s actions. Part of the controversy related to whether observers believed that blacks had planned the uprising on their own, or whether George William Gordon and possibly whites had led them.

Opponents of Eyre established the Jamaica Committee in December 1865, which called for Eyre to be tried for mass murder. More radical members of the Committee wanted him tried for the murder of British subjects, such as George William Gordon, under the rule of law, stating that Eyre&#x27;s actions taken under the aegis of martial law were illegal. The Committee leaders included the MPs John Bright, Charles Buxton, and Peter Taylor, as well as the scholars Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Goldwin Smith. Other supporters included T. H. Green, Henry Fawcett, and A. V. Dicey.

The Eyre Defence Committee was formed in August 1866 to support Eyre during the imminent legal actions. Its leaders included MP Lord John Manners, as well as James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, scientist John Tyndall, and the authors Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin. Other supporters were Alfred Tennyson, Charles Kingsley, and Charles Dickens.

The Jamaica Committee initially sought to have Eyre charged criminally with murder, but the grand jury did not indict him. They then supported a lawsuit against Eyre, &quot;Phillips v Eyre&quot;; the plaintiff Alexander Phillips was a black gentleman who had been arrested similarly to George William Gordon. The suit was decided in Eyre&#x27;s favour.

The rebellion was used as a justification for more centralized control of Britain&#x27;s empire.

===In Jamaica===

Eyre was replaced as governor by John Peter Grant who arrived in August 1866.

Since the 1830s free people of color, like Gordon, Edward Jordon, and Robert Osborn, had been elected to the Jamaican House of Assembly in increasing numbers, and that alarmed the colonial authorities. In the wake of the Morant Bay Rebellion, Eyre, with the support of the Colonial Office, persuaded the Assembly to renounce its charter, thus ending two centuries of elected representation in the Colony of Jamaica.

White planters were appointed by the governor. However, this move deprived the black majority of a voice in the colony&#x27;s government, and it was condemned by Jordon and Osborn. Jamaica became a Crown Colony, under direct rule from London.

==Legacy==
In 1969, Paul Bogle and George William Gordon were among several men who were named as Jamaican National Heroes, the highest honour in the nation.

===The Rebellion in popular culture===
Several Jamaicans in the first half of the 20th century wrote about the Rebellion:
* H. G. de Lisser, long-time editor of the newspaper &quot;The Gleaner,&quot; wrote a novel entitled &quot;Revenge&quot; (1918). It is now out of print. 
* Roger Mais, best known for his 1954 Rastafarian novel &quot;Brother Man,&quot; wrote the play &quot;George William Gordon&quot;, about the mixed-race politician who was tried under martial law and executed following the Rebellion, the play was first staged in 1938. 
* V. S. Reid devoted his novel &quot;New Day&quot; (1949) to commemorating the rebellion.

Non-Jamaican authors have also treated the Morant Bay Rebellion.

* It is the subject of chapter XI of the novel &quot;Caribbean&quot; (1989) by American James A. Michener. 
*It is also a setting for part of the novel &quot;James Miranda Barry&quot; (1999) by Patricia Duncker. (It was reissued in paperback as &quot;The Doctor: A Novel&quot; in 2002.) 
*The rebellion is also cited in the short story &quot;L&#x27;alfier nero&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Black Bishop&quot; in the game of chess) by the Italian author Arrigo Boito, where it is mistaken for a slave rebellion.

The rebellion has been featured in music as well. Reggae artists Third World featured the title track &quot;1865 (96° In The Shade)&quot; on their second album in 1977; the song described the events of the Morant Bay rebellion from the point of view of Paul Bogle and George William Gordon:

You caught me on the loose, fighting to be free, now you show me a noose on a cotton tree, entertainment for you, martyrdom for me ... Some may suffer and some may burn, but I know that one day my people will learn, as sure as the sun shines, way up in the sky, today I stand here a victim – the truth is I&#x27;ll never die.

<text>The Class 66 is a type of six-axle diesel-electric freight locomotive developed in part from the , for use on UK railways. Since its introduction the class has been successful and has been sold to British and other European railway companies. In Continental Europe it is marketed as the EMD Class 66 (JT42CWR).

== History ==

=== Background ===
On the privatisation of British Rail&#x27;s freight operations in 1996, Wisconsin Central Transportation Systems under the control of Ed Burkhardt bought a number of the newly privatised rail freight companies: Transrail Freight, Mainline Freight, Loadhaul, and later, Railfreight Distribution and Rail Express Systems; thus controlling 93% of UK rail freight. After a public relations exercise involving the input of the general public, the company was named English Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway (EWS).

EWS inherited a fleet of 1,600, mainly diesel, locomotives, with an average age of over 30 years; 300 had been cannibalised for spares. Typical of the fleet, the Class 47s needed a major overhaul every seven years, costing £400,000; yet had an average daily availability of less than 65% with only 16 days between major failures. To enable it to offer its stated lower pricing to customers, EWS needed to reduce operating costs and increase availability.

=== Order and specification ===
After reviewing the existing privately commissioned , which was more powerful, highly reliable and with lower operating costs, EWS approached its builder Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD), then a division of General Motors. EMD offered their JT42CWR model, which had the same loading gauge-passing bodyshell as the Class 59. The engine and traction motors were different models to enable higher speeds, and the Class 66s incorporated General Motors&#x27; version of a &quot;self-steering bogie&quot; (&quot;radial truck&quot;, in American usage), designed to reduce track wear and increase adhesion on curves.

Placing what was termed as &quot;the biggest British loco order since steam days&quot;, EWS placed an order for 250 units in May 1996 to be built at the EMD plant in London, Ontario, Canada at a cost of £375 million. Financed by Locomotion Capital (later Angel Trains), the first locomotives were ready in early 1998; the fastest delivery of an all-new locomotive type by GM.

The EMD 710 12-cylinder diesel engine is a development of a two-stroke engine used for over 20 years, whilst the EM2000 control equipment is the same as that used on Irish Railways IÉ 201 Class. EWS reduced the locomotive&#x27;s time into operation through specifying cab systems laid out like the Class 59, whilst increasing availability with a fuel tank of capacity, compared to on a standard Class 47.

=== United Kingdom ===

The first locomotive shipped to the UK arrived at Immingham in June 1998, taken to Derby for testing. The second was taken to AAR&#x27;s Pueblo Test Centre for endurance testing, before shipping to the UK. The locomotives then shipped at a rate of 11 per month into the UK via Newport Docks, until the order was completed in December 2001. After unloading, EWS engineers then simply took off the tarpaulin, unblocked the suspension, and finally as each was shipped with water and fuel, connected the batteries, before starting the engine and handing the locomotive into service. The ability to simply start up &#x27;66s&#x27; on the dockside and drive them under their own power to depots to enter service was nothing short of a revelation compared with many other BR locomotives, particularly the BR Class 60s.

Each locomotive is specified and guaranteed to 95% availability, aiming for a minimum of 180 days mean time between failures. It is designed to cover 1.6 million km between major rebuilds, equivalent to 18 years&#x27; service, with each major rebuild costed at £200,000.

The initial classification was as Class 61, then they were subsequently given the Class 66 designation in the British classification system (TOPS). In 1998 Freightliner placed an order for locomotives. They were followed by GB Railfreight, and then Direct Rail Services. The last of more than 500 built over an 18-year period was No 66779, &quot;Evening Star&quot;, delivered to GB Railfreight in spring 2016.

Although sometimes unpopular with many rail enthusiasts, due to their ubiquity and having caused the displacement of several older types of (mostly) British built locomotives, their high reliability has helped rail freight to remain competitive. Rail enthusiasts labelled the type &quot;The Red Death&quot; as they displaced many older types of locomotive whilst also acquiring the nicknames of &quot;sheds&quot; for the EWS (now DBS) locomotives (due to their upturned roof looking like a shed roof) with the Freightliner locomotives being called &quot;Freds&quot; as a portmanteau of &quot;Freightliner&quot; and &quot;Shed&quot;.

=== Continental Europe ===

The Class 66 design has also been introduced to Continental Europe where it is currently certified for operations in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, France, and Poland, with certification pending in the Czech Republic and Italy. They currently operate on routes in Sweden and Denmark and between Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Poland. As a result of its well-known British identity, EMD Europe markets the locomotive as &quot;Series 66&quot;.

=== UK importation ===
By 2011, following an increase in UK rail traffic after the 2008 Global Economic Crisis, EMD were struggling to source critical components of the locomotive — specifically castings. The final units of the Class 66 were produced in the London, Ontario plant that year following an industrial dispute and the introduction of new EU crash and emissions regulations which culminated in the cessation of production.

Due to a reduction in European freight volumes and migration of several operators to electric traction using multi-current locomotives such as the Alstom_Traxx and Siemens Eurosprinter, since mid-2012, a number of EMD Series 66 locomotives have been imported by UK rail freight operators and converted to UK type specifications. To date:
*GBRf bought three ex-Dutch locos, in 2012, which have been numbered 66747-749. The former identities of these were DE6316, DE6313 and DE6315 respectively.
*GBRf bought two ex-German &quot;Rush Rail&quot; locomotives, in 2013, which have been numbered 66750 &amp; 66751. The former identities of these were DE6606 (also used in Sweden with the number T664025) and DE6609 (also 2906) respectively
*GBRf bought three ex-Swedish locomotives, in 2019, which have been numbered 66790-792. The former identities of these were T66403, T66404 and T66405 respectively.

In September 2013, GB Railfreight announced a new order of a further 8 Class 66/7 locomotives from EMD, the first of the class to be built at EMD&#x27;s Muncie, Indiana plant. On 2 February GBRf ordered a further 13 locomotives. These 21 locomotives are numbered 66752-772. Numbers 66752-756 were shipped from America and arrived at Newport Docks in July 2014. No. 66752 has been named &quot;The Hoosier State&quot;, a nickname for Indiana. A further seven locomotives (66773-779) were later added to the fleet, utilising six power units that had been in the UK, plus one recovered from the scrapped 66734. The presence of these power units in the UK circumvented European emission compliance regulations and permitted them to be exported to EMD Muncie for installation in further class 66 bodyshells.

=== Emission compliance ===
Numbers 66752-779 were the last Class 66s ordered for service in Great Britain because of increasingly stringent emission regulations. 66779 was the last Class 66 ever to be built. Although the Class 66s meet stage 3a of the regulations, they do not meet stage 3b. Stage 3b would have required additional exhaust treatment equipment that could not easily be accommodated within the UK loading gauge. The same restrictions apply to the and Class 70. The restriction does not apply to second-hand locomotives, provided that they are imported from within the European Union. The purpose of the regulation was to put a cap on the total number of non-compliant locomotives in the EU.

== Current operators ==

=== Colas Rail ===

Colas Rail took over the ex-Advenza Cemex Cement flow after the company went bust, initially using the five former Advenza Freight and Direct Rail Services locomotives 66406-410 which had been renumbered 66841-845. Subsequently, as part of a deal with GB Railfreight, Colas Rail replaced them with five ex-Freightliner 66573-577 which were renumbered 66846–850. The five ex-Direct Rail Services class 66s were transferred to GB Railfreight and renumbered 66742–746.

=== DB Cargo UK ===

DB Cargo UK bought out EWS. Their Class 66 fleet includes four locomotives capable of banking heavy trains over the Lickey Incline. On these specific locomotives, the knuckle coupler has been modified to allow remote releasing from inside the cab, whilst in motion. It also includes fifteen locomotives fitted with RETB signalling equipment, for working in northern Scotland and RETB-fitted branchlines. A few DB Cargo UK Class 66s are now working in Europe as part of DB Cargo France and DB Cargo Polska.

=== Direct Rail Services ===

Direct Rail Services (DRS), which at the time was a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), ordered ten Class 66/4 locomotives (66401–410) in 2002, employed on new Anglo-Scottish traffic, some with Stobart Rail. In 2006, ten more T2 specification units (66411–420) were delivered, a further ten (66421–430) in late 2007, and four more (66431–434) in 2008.

After the first 20 Class 66s operated by DRS were transferred to Freightliner and GB Railfreight, leaving just 14 in their fleet, DRS leased the five former Fastline Freight locomotives.

=== Freightliner ===

Freightliner followed EWS by initially ordering five new Class 66/5 locomotives, and have continued to order in small batches. As of 2020, the Class 66/5 fleet had reached 89 examples; 66521 was withdrawn after the 2001 crash at Great Heck and later scrapped.

In 2000 a new Class 66/6 sub-class was built, with a lower gear ratio, enabling heavier trains to be hauled, albeit at slower speed. There are presently 25 examples of this class, numbered 66601-625. Some of these locomotives have since been exported for use with Freightliner Poland.

During 2004 the company took delivery of the most recent Class 66/9 sub-class of the locomotive, which are a low-emission variant. All new locomotives for all companies are now of the low-emission &quot;T2&quot; type. The seven such locomotives as 66951-957.

In 2011, Freightliner took on Direct Rail Services&#x27; 66411-420.

=== GB Railfreight ===

GB Railfreight initially leased seventeen Class 66/7 locomotives, before increasing its fleet to 32. During April 2006 five more low-emission locomotives (numbered 66718-722) were delivered, liveried for use on the Metronet/Transport for London contracts. A further order for five more locomotives (66723-727) was delivered in early 2007, and another five locomotives (66728–732) in April 2008. 66733-746 are formed of Class 66s from Direct Rail Services, Freightliner and Colas Rail. In 2011 66720 was painted in a special &quot;Rainbow&quot; livery. In June 2012, 66734 derailed at Loch Treig whilst working 6S45 North Blyth–Fort William and was consequently cut up on site and scrapped.

The final seven Class 66s to be built for the British market arrived on 12 February 2016 aboard the cargo ship &quot;Happy Dragon&quot; at Newport docks and consisted of numbers 66773–779. On 15 February they were towed by 66708 north to Doncaster Roberts Road depot where they were commissioned and then put to work.

66779 remained under a tarpaulin until 10 May 2016 when it was revealed at the NRM York with a special livery and nameplates to commemorate the fact it is the final Class 66 ever built for the British market. The locomotive has been painted in BR Lined Green and named &quot;Evening Star&quot;, in reference to BR Standard Class 9F 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot; which was the last BR steam locomotive to be built. It was unveiled in a special ceremony inside the Great Hall at the National Railway Museum in York on 10 May 2016 before staying there opposite its namesake, No. 92220, for two weeks. At the same ceremony, the CEO of GBRf, John Smith, handed the curator of the National Railway Museum a document offering 66779 to the national collection when it is retired in about 40 years time.

In addition to those locomotives sourced from domestic operators (Direct Rail Services, Freightliner, Colas Rail and DB Cargo UK), eight further locomotives have been obtained from European operators. A further five have been purchased from Heavy Haul Power International and will be transferred from Germany beginning in April 2021. The locos will go to Doncaster to be converted to UK specification.

== Former operators ==
=== Advenza Freight ===
Advenza Freight, a Cotswold Rail subsidiary, operated Class 66841-844. They were primarily used on Advenza&#x27;s scrap and cement flows. The locomotives originated from the batch that Direct Rail Services returned.

Advenza Freight ceased operations in October 2009 and the Class 66s returned to storage. These locos were housed at Gloucester Carriage Sidings where Advenza Freight was based.

=== Fastline ===

Fastline operated intermodal services between Doncaster and Birmingham International Railfreight Terminal (BIFT), and Thamesport, in North Kent, using refurbished locomotives. The company ordered five Class 66/3 locomotives to operate a coal flow from Hatfield Colliery, which were delivered in 2008.

Following the demise of Jarvis in 2010, and Fastline going into administration on 29 March 2010, these locomotives were placed in storage, being towed to Direct Rail Services&#x27; Carlisle Kingmoor and Crewe Gresty Lane depots for storage. During 2011, DRS repainted the five ex-Fastline locomotives and added them to their own fleet, keeping their original numbers.

== Driver reception ==
The British train drivers&#x27; union ASLEF has complained that the locomotives are unfit and unsafe to work in, citing excessive heat, noise levels and poor seating.

In April 2007, ASLEF proposed a ban on their members driving the locomotives during the British summer 2007 period. Keith Norman, ASLEF&#x27;s general secretary, described the cabs as &quot;unhealthy, unsafe and unsatisfactory&quot;. Research showed that in July 2006, when the weather had been extremely hot, the number of incidents where a driver had passed a signal at danger (SPAD) increased. EWS entered into discussions and made amendments to a series of trial locomotives, GB Railfreight and Freightliner also investigated cab improvements. In June 2007, progress on the issue led ASLEF to withdraw its threat of industrial action.

In Norway, CargoNet related complaints about the noise levels in the CD66 variant of the Class 66 resulted in higher pay rates for drivers.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 28 February 2001, 66521 was involved in the 2001 Great Heck rail crash/Selby rail crash which resulted in 10 deaths including the driver Stephen Dunn. The locomotive was written off and scrapped as a result of major damage sustained in the accident.

<doc id="996141" wikidata="Q740282" url="?curid=996141" title="Qasim Amin">
<text>Qasim Amin (, ; 1 December 1863 – 12 April 1908) was an Egyptian jurist, Islamic Modernist and one of the founders of the Egyptian national movement and Cairo University. Qasim Amin has been historically viewed as one of the Arab world&#x27;s &quot;first feminists&quot;, although he joined the discourse on women&#x27;s rights quite late in its development, and his &quot;feminism&quot; has been the subject of scholarly controversy. Amin was a philosopher, a reformer, and a judge, besides being a member of Egypt&#x27;s aristocratic class, and a central figure in the Nahda movement. His advocacy of greater rights for women catalyzed debate over women&#x27;s issues in the Arab world. He criticized veiling, seclusion, early marriage, and lack of education of Muslim women. More recent scholarship has argued that he internalized a colonialist discourse on women&#x27;s issues in the Islamic world, regarded Egyptian women as objects serving to achieve national aspirations, and in practice advocated reforms that diminished the legal rights of women in marriage contracts.

Greatly influenced by the works of Darwin, Amin is quoted as saying: &quot;If Egyptians did not modernize along European lines and if they were unable to compete successfully in the struggle for survival they would be eliminated&quot;. He was also influenced by the works of Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill who argued for equality of the sexes. Amin believed that heightening women&#x27;s status in society must greatly improve the nation. His friendships with Muhammad Abduh and Saad Zaghloul also influenced this thinking. Amin blamed traditional Moslems for Egyptian women&#x27;s oppression, saying that the Quran does not teach this subjugation but rather supports women&#x27;s rights. His beliefs were often supported by Quranic verses.

Amin was born into an aristocratic family. His father was a governor of Diyarbekir Elayet, and his mother was the daughter of an Egyptian aristocrat. Amin finished law school when he was seventeen and was one of 37 to receive a government scholarship to study at the University of Montpellier in France. He is said to have been influenced by Western culture, especially its treatment of women, and this became a role model in his struggle to liberate Egyptian women. His crusade began in 1894 when he wrote &quot;Les Egyptiens. Response a M. Le duc d&#x27;Harcourt&quot;, a rebuttal to Duke d&#x27;Harcourt&#x27;s work (1893), which downgraded Egyptian culture and its women. Amin, not satisfied with his own rebuttal, wrote &quot;Tahrir al mara&#x27;a&quot; (The Liberation of Women) in 1899, in which he blamed Egyptian women&#x27;s &quot;veiling&quot;, their lack of education, and their &quot;slavery&quot; to Egyptian men as the cause of Egypt&#x27;s weakness. He believed that Egyptian women were the backbone of a strong nationalistic people and, therefore, their roles in society should drastically change to better the nation. Amin is known throughout Egypt as a member of the intellectual society who drew connections between education and nationalism leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement during the early 1900s.

==Early life==
Amin was born to a Kurdish father and an Egyptian mother. His father, Muhammad Amin Bey, served as governor of Diyarbekir Vilayet before moving the family to Alexandria where Amin was born. Qasim&#x27;s father settled in Egypt and became the commander of Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha&#x27;s army; he also held large feudal estates in both Alexandria and Diyarbekir. Qasim&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Ahmad Bey Khattab, a son of Tahir Pasha, himself a nephew of Muhammad Ali Pasha. Qasim is recorded as a hereditary Bey, both paternally and maternally, in the &#x27;Imperial and Asiatic quarterly review and oriental and colonial record.&#x27;

==Education==
Amin attended primary school in Alexandria, and then in 1875 attended Cairo&#x27;s Preparatory School. The curriculum at the school was said to be strict and heavily Europeanized. By 1881, at the age of seventeen, he received his law degree from the Khedival School and was one of 37 to receive a government scholarship to continue his education at Frances&#x27; University of Montpellier. His mission in France lasted four years.

==Marriage==
In 1894, Amin married Zeyneb, the daughter of Admiral Amin Tafiq, and so he joined an Egyptian aristocratic family. His wife had been raised by a British nanny. Therefore, he felt it was necessary for his daughters to be raised by a British nanny as well. Amin&#x27;s advocacy of resistance to women wearing the niqab was said to have perpetuated within his own family. Although he could not dissuade his wife from wearing it, his plan was to teach the younger generation of females, like his daughter, that they should not wear it.

==Career==
After his accomplishment in France, Amin became a part of the British Empire&#x27;s civil servant class and, in 1885, he was appointed a jurist in the Mixed Courts, which had been created ten years earlier. These courts had western influence as they were based partly on the Napoleonic judicial system as well as on Islamic Law. Also, the jurists tended to be from England, Austria, Germany, or France. Amin had a successful tenure. The court&#x27;s governmental tribunal often competed with the religious courts in its decision making, and it was noted for its true reflection of the &quot;right way&quot; because it based its judgments on valid and sound reasoning. By 1887, Amin had entered the predominately western-run Egyptian office of the Government Division of Legal Affairs. Within four years, he was selected as one of the National Court&#x27;s Egyptian judges. He was also the Chancellor of the Cairo National Court of Appeals.

Amin was one of the founders of Cairo University, known then as the National University, and was a member of its constituent committee. He insisted that Egypt needed a Western-style university. He was appointed as the university&#x27;s first secretary-general, and also its Vice-President.

==Influence of the Nahda (Awakening)==
Amin became a central figure of the Nahda movement that achieved prominence in Egypt during a period of &quot;feminist consciousness&quot; in the latter part of the nineteenth century. He agreed with his mentor, the exiled Muhammad Abduh, in blaming Islamic traditionalists for the moral and intellectual decay of Islam which, they believed, had caused its colonisation by western forces. Egypt, at the time, was a colony of the British Empire and partly of France. 

Abduh called for all Muslims to unite, to recognise the true message sent by Allah which gave women equal status, and to resist Western imperialism. Amin accepted Abduh&#x27;s philosophies as he too believed the traditionalists had created an inferior society by not following true Islamic laws. Like Abduh, Amin advocated the right of females in society, and rejected the cultural values that kept Egyptian women in submission.

In his book &quot;The Liberation of Women&quot; (1899), Amin argued for the abolition of the veil. He thought that changing customs regarding women and changing their costume, abolishing the veil in particular, were key to bringing about the desired general social transformation. To answer the conservatives who argued that abolition of the veil would have an influence on women&#x27;s purity, Amin replied not from the perspective of gender equality but from the standpoint of following the superior Western civilization. He wrote: &quot;Do Egyptians imagine that the men of Europe, who have attained such completeness of intellect and feeling that they were able to discover the force of steam and electricity...these souls that daily risk their lives in the pursuit of knowledge and honour above the pleasure of life, ... these intellects and these souls that we so admire, could possibly fail to know the means of safeguarding woman and preserving her purity? Do they think that such a people would have abandoned veiling after it had been in use among them if they had seen any good in it?&quot;

Some contemporary feminist scholars, notably Leila Ahmed, have challenged Amin&#x27;s status as the supposed &quot;father of Egyptian feminism&quot;. Ahmed points out that in the gender-segregated society of the time, Amin could have had very little contact with Egyptian women other than immediate family, servants, and possibly prostitutes. His portrait of Egyptian women as backward, ignorant, and lagging behind their European &quot;sisters&quot; was therefore based on very limited evidence. Ahmed also concludes that through his rigorous critique and generalizations of women in Egypt along with his zealous praise of European society and colonialism, Amin, in effect, promoted the substitution of Egyptian androcentrism with Western androcentrism, &quot;not&quot; feminism.

Although he saw women as inferior to men, Amin supported the legislation of divorce. According to tradition, divorce is valid if the husband verbally announces it three times. Amin thought such oral agreement was not serious enough and that the lack of legality in the process contributed to the high rate of divorce in Cairo. Many men, he argued, accidentally divorced from their wives through jokes or quarrels.

==Books by Qasim Amin==
*1894: &quot;&quot; was written as a response to Duke d&#x27;Harcourt&#x27;s criticism of Egyptian life and women. Amin did not defend Egyptian women in his rebuttal, but he did defend Islam&#x27;s treatment of women.
*1899: &quot;Tahrir al- mar&#x27;a (The Liberation of Women)&quot;. Dissatisfied with his rebuttal, Amin called for the education of women only to primary level. He maintained his belief in patriarchal domination over women, yet advocated modification of legislation pertaining to divorce, polygamy, and abolition of the veil. The book was co-written with Muhammad Abduh and Ahmad Lufti al-Sayid. It used many Quranic verses to support his belief.
*1900: &quot;al-Mar&#x27;a al-jadida (The New Woman)&quot;. In this book, Amin envisioned &#x27;the new woman&#x27; emerging in Egypt whose conduct and actions were modelled on the Western woman. The book was considered more liberal in nature, but he used social Darwinism as his argument. He states: &quot;A woman may be given in marriage to a man she does not know who forbids her the right to leave him and forces her to this or that and then throws her out as he wishes: this is slavery indeed&quot;.

==Intellectual contribution==
An advocate for social reform in his native country of Egypt, during the latter part of the 19th century when it was a colony under the British Empire, Amin called for the establishment of nuclear families similar to those in France, where he saw women not placed under the same patriarchy culture that subjugated Egyptian women. Amin believed that Egyptian women were denied their Quranic rights to handle their own business affairs and marry and divorce freely. He refuted polygamy saying it &quot;implied an intense contempt of women,&quot; and that marriage should be a mutual agreement. He opposed the Egyptian custom of &quot;veiling&quot; the woman, saying it was the major pronunciation of woman&#x27;s oppression. The niqab, Amin said, made it impossible to identify women. To him, when they walked with their niqab and long dresses, it made them more noticeable to men and more distrusted. Furthermore, he exclaimed that men in the West treated women with more dignity allowing them to go to school, walk without a veil, and speak their mind. This freedom, he insisted &quot;contributed significantly&quot; to the foundation of knowledge in the nation. He supported the idea that educated women brought forward educated children. When women were enslaved in the home, without a voice and without an education, they tended to spend their time wastefully and bring forth children that would grow to be lazy, ignorant, and mistrustful. Once educated, these women could become better mothers and wives by learning to manage their homes better. Amin gave an example of the situation. He said &quot;Our present situation resembles that of a very wealthy man who locks up his gold in a chest. This man,&quot; he said &quot;unlocks his chest daily for the mere pleasure of see his chest. If he knew better, he could invest his gold and double his wealth in a short time.&quot; Therefore, it was important to the Egyptian nation that women&#x27;s roles should be changed. Although, he maintained his view that Egypt remain a patriarchal society, its women should remove the veil and be given a primary education. This he believed was a stepping stone to a stronger Egyptian nation that which was free of English colonialism.

==Controversy==

Critics of Amin&#x27;s philosophies are quick to point out that Amin had no association with women other than aristocratic women or prostitutes and they therefore question his stance of condemning all Egyptian women. Furthermore, Leila Ahmed, a novelist and reformer, suggests in her book &quot;Women and Gender in Islam&quot; that Amin&#x27;s attempt to discredit the veil as a reason for Egyptian weakness is clearly a Western view. She illustrates how Westerners tend to use the veil as a reason to colonize Islamic nations by correlating the veil with inferiority. In addition, Ahmed points out that Amin&#x27;s Egyptian woman, would not have control over her own body but instead it would be used to build up the nation. To her, this is hypocrisy because the Egyptian woman would still be the slave of her husband, her family, and her nation. In addition, history professor, Mona Russell further challenges Amin&#x27;s description of the new woman saying that it was &quot;one of the fruits of modern society.&quot; She argues that she is not &quot;new&quot;, does not care to be &quot;synonymous&quot; with the Western woman, and is her own being. Amin, they believe, was influenced by his foreign education and upper middle class position which looked to foreign colonialism as superior rule. It was his way of integrating into foreign colonialism that held power of Egypt. His quote in which he says &quot;We today enjoy a justice and a freedom the like of which I do not think Egypt has ever witnessed at anytime in the past&quot; is proof of this admiration. They therefore feel that his opinions were based on bias rather than truth.

==Quotes==
* &quot;I do not advocate the equality between men and women in education for this is not necessary&quot;
* &quot;Our laziness has caused us to be hostile to every unfamiliar idea.&quot;
* &quot;The number of children killed by ignorant women every year exceeds the number of people who die in the most brutal wars.&quot;
* &quot;A good mother is more useful to her species than a good man, while a corrupt mother is more harmful than a corrupt man.&quot;
* &quot;It is impossible to be successful men if they do not have mothers capable of raising them to be successful.&quot;
* &quot;There is no doubt that the man&#x27;s decision to imprison his wife contradicts the freedom which is the woman&#x27;s natural right.&quot;
* &quot;The woman who is forbidden to educate herself save in the duties of the servant, or is limited in her educational pursuits is indeed a slave, because her natural instincts and God-given talents are subordinated in deference to her condition, which is tantamount to moral enslavement.&quot;

<text>A cultural system is the interaction of different elements in culture. While a cultural system is very different from a social system, sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural system.

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
Talcott Parsons, a major figure in sociology and the main originator of action theory in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons&#x27; view, &quot;Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels.&quot; In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term &quot;functionalism&quot; was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social structure and agency. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood&#x27;s conceptual distinction influenced Jürgen Habermas&#x27; discussion in the classic &quot;Legitimation Crises&quot;, who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
Margaret Archer (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work &quot;Culture and Agency&quot;, argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as Bronisław Malinowski and later by Mary Douglas, is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin&#x27;s influence and then Talcott Parsons&#x27; approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by Antonio Gramsci through the theory of cultural hegemony through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of critical realism, suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture. Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: &quot;logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency – that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory – yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. &quot; (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the &quot;cultural studies&quot; and &quot;cultural indicators&quot; approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of &quot;cultural systems integration.&quot; These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, &quot;If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies.&quot; Constrained by Merton&#x27;s middle range theory [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

<text>John Lafayette Camp Jr. (September 15, 1855 – August 10, 1918) was a judge in Texas state district court and United States Attorney for the western district of Texas.

==Biography==
Camp followed his father John Lafayette Camp as a member of the Texas State Senate from 1887 to 1891. Then, for several years, he practiced law in San Antonio. In 1897 he was appointed Judge in State District Court, a post he held for 16 years. During this time he was connected with the preservation of the Alamo.

In 1913 President Wilson appointed him the U.S. Attorney for the western district of Texas. He would hold this post until his death. On June 27, 1915 he brought charges against former Mexico President Victoriano Huerta for conspiring with the German government. Huerta was arrested, and died six months later while still captive. In 1916, the Texas members of the U.S. Congress (all of the Representatives and both Senators) recommended that he replace retiring judge Maxey on the bench of the U.S. Court for the west Texas district. Wilson declined to nominate him, due to his policy of only naming judges younger than 60.

Camp died in San Antonio on August 10, 1918.

<text>Timberjack is a manufacturer of forestry machinery for both cut-to-length and whole tree logging, and was a subsidiary of John Deere from 2000 to 2006.

==History==
Timberjack was founded in Woodstock, Ontario, in the 1950s by Wes Magill and Robert Simmons, who designed an articulated
four-wheel drive tractor with a winch at the back. They produced a prototype and production took off from there. There were affiliations with King Trailer ind. and with Timberland Ellicott Corp. before Eaton Corporation purchased Timberjack and named it the Forestry Equipment Division. The traditional color of all Timberjack products was a reddish orange. In 1992, the color was changed to green with black and yellow trim. John Deere purchased Timberjack and continued the green, black and yellow paint scheme.
Timberjack was owned by the Eaton Corporation in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. In 1984 Timberjack made a leveraged buyout from Eaton to become an independent company.

Timberjack was acquired by FMG (ForestMachineGroup), owned by Finnish Rauma-Repola. After a short period carrying the double-name FMG-Timberjack, in 1993 Timberjack became the brandname for the group. Other well known forest machine brands, which have been incorporated into FMG-Timberjack were Swedish Kockums, ÖSA and Bruun System as well as Finnish LOKOMO. In December 2000 John Deere bought Timberjack from Metso Corporation (formerly Rauma-Repola) for $570 million which also included the purchase of a separate company, Waratah, a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty harvester heads.

As of June, 2006, at the forestry fair &quot;Florence Wood&quot;, the Timberjack product line was discontinued, and John Deere, its parent company, became the largest single brand of forestry equipment. Its global market share for both cut-to-length and full tree equipment was very strong shortly after the acquisition.

<text>The COSMAC Elf was an RCA 1802 microprocessor-based computer described in a series of construction articles in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine in 1976 and 1977. Through the back pages of electronics magazines, both Netronics and Quest Electronics offered low-priced, enhanced kits that were based on this design. The system was a very early single-board personal computer. It was operated without built-in ROMs and programs were entered directly with help of the CPU integrated DMA using 8 toggle switches and an Input push button.

It featured two hexadecimal LED displays for byte data value output and a set of 8 toggle switches for input. (a hexadecimal keypad was an optional extension) The base configuration had 256 bytes of RAM, but expansion projects could raise that to a power of two-based memory store, with an upper limit of 64K address space.

The original Elf design used a crystal with a frequency in the range of 1 to 2 MHz with the 1802&#x27;s built in oscillator circuit.

A simple circuit used the DMA feature of the 1802 to permit entry of programs and data into RAM through the toggle switches. Entering a byte via the toggle switches and pressing the &quot;input&quot; button would enter a byte into RAM and display it on the pair of hex LEDs, then advance the DMA counter to the next location. A &quot;memory protect&quot; switch could be used to disable memory alteration. If an error was made in program entry, it could be corrected by turning on memory protect, turning off load mode (thus resetting the program counter to zero), turning on load mode, and pressing &quot;input&quot; to advance to the address of the incorrect data. After turning off memory protect, the correct value could be entered.

The fourth article of the series presented modifications to use a companion RCA 1861 “Pixie” video generator IC (CDP1861). The Pixie required a 1.76 MHz clock, and since that was an uncommon crystal frequency, usually a readily available 3.579545 MHz colorburst crystal was instead used in a separate oscillator circuit with a divide-by-two circuit to drive the clock inputs of both the microprocessor and Pixie. The resulting 1.7897725 MHz clock was close enough for the hardware to work. Monochrome video output (with timing roughly approximating NTSC standard) could be generated using DMA operations interleaved with carefully arranged 1802 opcodes as instructions in software. The maximum resolution of the 1861 was 64h by 128v rectangular pixels. By changing the placement of instructions in the video display control and interrupt routines, pixel rows could be repeated to obtain lower resolutions, allowing the video display to be used with 256 bytes of RAM (64×32 square pixels).

A one-bit output from the microprocessor, the Q line, could be driven by software to produce sounds through an attached speaker, to save programs in RAM to a cassette recorder, and for serial I/O output. Branch instructions in the 1802 instruction set could read the state of the EF1 through EF4 single bit value input lines, which were used to read the &#x27;I&#x27; keypad (input) momentary pushbutton (typically EF4), programs from the cassette recorder through interface circuitry, serial I/O input, and input from peripherals such as a light pen. There are also seven 8-bit I/O ports available for decoding and interfacing.

== Microcomputers ==
The original Elf computers were essentially home-built versions of the RCA Microkit, Microtutor I and Microtutor II, which were RCA&#x27;s demonstration boards for their CDP1801 2-chip predecessor and single-chip CDP1802 microprocessors.

Enhanced kits such as the Netronics Elf II and Quest Super Elf added built-in features such as keypads for data entry, serial I/O, cassette interface, and the CDP1861 &quot;Pixie&quot; video chip. RCA later introduced their own similarly expanded version as the COSMAC VIP.

In August 2006, Nuts and Volts magazine, along with Spare Time Gizmos, released a project to build the &quot;Cosmac Elf 2000,&quot; based on the original Elf, with some newer and easier to find components and enhanced features, modules, and functionality, including the STG1861 Pixie Graphics Replacement board that is functionally equivalent to the now-rare RCA CDP1861 integrated circuit.

The Membership Card is a modern, simple COSMAC Elf-like remake for retrocomputing hobbyists that is designed to fit in an Altoids tin.

Various other hobbyist systems can be found on the Internet, including hardware emulators using FPGA and modern microcontrollers.

== Software ==
A series of newsletters and small booklets offered by Netronics and Quest contained 1802 machine language and CHIP-8 programs, along with schematics for expanding the Elf and adding peripherals, including a light pen. Other, similar information and hobbyist software projects can be found on the Internet. The only published book about the 1802 is Tom Swan&#x27;s &quot;Programmer’s Guide to the 1802&quot; (1981), which has been made available as a PDF after being out of print for many years.

Tiny BASIC, a version of BASIC offered by Tom Pittman, could be used to write small BASIC programs on the Elf that could display through the Pixie low-resolution monochrome graphics display or TV-Typewriter hardware. Pittman also wrote a small booklet about the 1802 titled &quot;A Short Course In Programming&quot;, which he has allowed to be published and made available online free of charge.

Mike Riley has written an editor, assembler, BASIC and FORTH interpreters, a BIOS, and the Elf/OS disk operating system that will run on expanded Elf systems, including the COSMAC Elf 2000.

Other languages available are noted at the RCA 1802 Wikipedia entry, including interpreters, compilers and assemblers.

Game cartridges for the RCA Studio II contain Chip-8 games, which can run on other 1802 systems. File dumps of these games can be found on the Internet.

<doc id="996157" wikidata="Q1122583" url="?curid=996157" title="Indochine (band)">
<text>Indochine () is a French rock and new wave band formed in Paris in 1981. They became very successful in the Francophone world, Europe and Latin America in the 1980s, with songs like &quot;L&#x27;Aventurier&quot; and &quot;Canary Bay&quot;. Following the release of several critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful, albums in the 1990s, the group returned to stardom with the release of &quot;Paradize&quot; in 2002. Indochine has sold over 10 million albums and singles, making them the best selling French band.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===
Indochine (French for Indochina) was formed in 1981 by two Frenchmen in their early twenties, Nicola Sirkis and Dominique Nicolas, in Paris. They soon added Dimitri Bodiansky, the cousin of one of Nicola&#x27;s friends.

They gave their first concert at Le Rose Bonbon, a café in Paris on 29 September 1981. This brief performance on stage earned them their first contract with a record company.

They recorded their first single in November 1981. It included two songs, &quot;Dizzidence Politik&quot; and &quot;Françoise&quot;, but drew more attention from critics than from the mainstream media and only reached a limited audience.

Stéphane Sirkis, Nicola&#x27;s twin brother who had already performed with the band on stage, officially joined the band, and in April 1982 the group recorded their first album, &quot;L&#x27;Aventurier&quot;, which sold more than 250,000 copies. The album was well received by the press and by an emerging new wave audience.

L&#x27;aventurier is the song of the summer 1983 in France.

In 1983, Indochine released a second album entitled &quot;Le Péril Jaune&quot; (&quot;Yellow Peril&quot;) which sold 225,000 copies. Indochine had by this stage become a major act in French music. In 1984, the band toured France. They were also successful in Scandinavia, most notably in Sweden. The Swedish releases of the singles &quot;Kao Bang&quot; and &quot;Canary Bay&quot; became hugely successful, spending several weeks on the Swedish top 10 sales chart and on the radio chart Trackslistan. Arriving at the venue for a show in Stockholm soon after, the band were met by hundreds of screaming fans described as similar to Beatlemania.

By 1985, they had achieved a large following, reflected by the success of such songs as &quot;Troisième sexe&quot; (&quot;third sex&quot;), &quot;Canary Bay&quot;, and &quot;Trois nuits par semaine&quot;. Their third album, &quot;3&quot;, sold 750,000 copies in Europe. Serge Gainsbourg directed the video to &quot;Tes yeux noirs&quot;, one of the group&#x27;s most successful songs.

Indochine becomes the largest &quot;new wave&quot; band in France. The single &quot;L&#x27;Aventurier&quot; won the French awards &quot;bus d&#x27;acier 1983&quot;.

In 1986, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the band, Indochine decided to release the recording of the concert given at the Zénith in Paris.

Their fourth album, &quot;7000 Danses&quot;, produced by Joe Glasman, was released in 1987. It sold about 320,000 copies making it a successful album though far less so than its predecessor, &quot;3&quot;. This is partly due to the band&#x27;s efforts to produce a less mainstream, commercial album. &quot;7000 Danses&quot; was also released amidst a controversy stemming from rock critics claiming that Indochine were a mere copy of British band The Cure. In spite of the controversy fans continued to support the group.

==== 1988 Tour ====

Starting in 1986 the band gained a following in Lima, Peru as a result of the radio broadcast of their &#x27;L&#x27;Aventurier&#x27; single. Then, in early 1987, the small record label, El Virrey, negotiated the rights to the &#x27;Au Zénith&#x27; album, which it released as 33 rpm LP and on cassette tape.

Surprised by this development, Indochine decided to add a stop in Lima after their transatlantic debut in Montreal. Following their appearance in Montreal on 6 April 1988, the band traveled to Peru. There, they performed before their Lima fans in four shows, on 29 and 30 April, and on 6 and 7 May 1988, at the Coliseo Amauta, reaching a total audience of over 40,000 people. In that period the band sold some 400,000 recordings in Peru.

That was the only Indochine tour in the late 1980s. For this tour the quartet had the participation of guest musicians such as Diego Burgard (Bass) and Jean-My Truong (Drums), a documentary about the tour was filmed in different cities in Europe, Canada and Peru and it was released for sale on VHS tape in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
Drained after many months touring, the band took a break. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Le Baiser&quot;, was released in early 1990. Fans were shocked to discover that Dimitri Bodiansky was no longer part of the group, having decided to leave the band in January 1989 . His departure can be attributed to a number of reasons. First of all, Indochine&#x27;s sound had evolved over the years and Bodiansky found he had less and less to do as a saxophonist. He was also feeling pressure at home having recently become a father. All this contributed to tension between him and the rest of the band. Bodiansky remains a much loved member of the original Indochine line-up and since his departure has guest starred with the band on stage.

1991 marked Indochine&#x27;s tenth anniversary. To celebrate the occasion, &quot;Le Birthday Album&quot; was released. It was a best of compilation, including one new track, &quot;La Guerre Est Finie&quot; (&quot;The War Is Over&quot;), which was released as a single. The album&#x27;s success was considerable (it sold 600,000 copies across Europe) and rekindled interest in the group. However, the single&#x27;s title proved unfortunate in light of the fact that the Persian Gulf War had just started at the time. For this reason, many radio stations opted not to play the track.

&quot;Un jour dans notre vie&quot;, their sixth studio album, was released in 1993. It proved unsuccessful, both commercially and critically.

&quot;Un jour dans notre vie&quot; wins French awards &quot; video clip fantastique Gerardmer 1994&quot;

On 27 February 1999, Stéphane Sirkis, guitarist, keyboardist and Nicola&#x27;s twin brother, died at the age of 39 of hepatitis. He had requested that the band continue after his death.

=== 2000s ===

In October 2000, the band started a small but successful acoustic tour named &quot;Nuits Intimes&quot;. The album is released in January 2001.

2001 begins. Nicola and Oli de Sat compose most of the album &quot;Paradize&quot; that would be released the next year. Ann Scott, Camille Laurens, Mickey 3D, Gerard Manset, Jean-Louis Murat and Melissa Auf der Maur collaborated on the album.

In 2002, they enjoyed renewed success with the &quot;Paradize&quot; album which sold 1,000,000 copies, including the chart topper &quot;J&#x27;ai demandé à la lune&quot;.This album has marked a change in aesthetics and genre, moving towards a darker tone and more introspective lyrics, influenced by popular acts such as Nine Inch Nails, Placebo and Marilyn Manson.

In 2003, the band received the MTV Europe Music Awards for: &quot;Best French Act&quot;, the NRJ Music Awards for: &quot;Album of the year&quot; and La Victoires de la Musique for: &quot;Best pop album of the year&quot;

In December 2005, Indochine returned with &quot;Alice &amp; June&quot;, featuring a collaboration with Placebo frontman Brian Molko. On 6 and 7 June 2006, the group had a concert in Hanoi Opera House to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

In December 2007, Indochine released a triple live DVD and double CD album entitled &quot;Alice &amp; June Tour&quot;. The album featured the full concert recorded in Lille, France in March 2007.

In 2008 Indochine joins the Reporters Sans Frontières campaign, for the boycott of the Beijing Olympic Games&#x27;s opening ceremony. The cover of the 80&#x27;s single &#x27;You Spin me Round&#x27; is released (all the collected founds were entirely given to RSF).

Their 11th studio album, &quot;La République des Meteors&quot;, was released on 9 March 2009. The album marked a change in their musical style, slowly moving away from the dark and quirky realms they had explored with &quot;Paradize&quot; and &quot;Alice &amp; June&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
Indochine was the first French band to perform at the Stade de France, on 26 June 2010 their biggest gig ever, sold out and in front of 80,000 people.

In November 2012, the band released their new single &quot;Memoria&quot;, from their upcoming album &quot;Black City Parade&quot;.

&quot;Black City Parade&quot; was released on 11 February 2013 with much anticipation from the fans. The album, despite its almost gloomy cover art, features much brighter and warmer music than the last two albums. The band seemed to want include references to their synthpop and new wave beginnings.
Indochine played several sold-out shows during the first leg of the &quot;Black City Tour&quot; which kicked off on 21 February 2013. Five legs are planned for the &quot;Black City Tour&quot;. The band stated that they will be playing around the world. They later announced that they will return to the Stade de France on 27 June 2014.

The second single for &quot;Black City Parade&quot; was &quot;College Boy&quot;, a song widely acknowledged to narrate the life of a homosexual teenage boy dealing with bashing and harassment. The video for the single was directed by Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan. The video premiered online with a disclaimer stating that it contained violent scenes and would not be suitable for a young audience. The video depicts a young male student facing mobbing and harassment from his schoolmates. The video culminates in him being brutally crucified and shot in the torso by his fellow students. Many criticisms have poured over the Internet about whether the video should be broadcast or not.

The band played two nights at the Stade de France on 27 &amp; 28 June 2014. They followed the stadium concerts with a much smaller show at London&#x27;s O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 14 July 2014.

In April 2015, the band undertook the eight dates Europe City Club Tour, which saw the band extend beyond its Francophone base by visiting Spain, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.

2016 was the year of The Festival Tours with performances at &quot;Papillons De Nuit&quot; (20 May), &quot;Les Ardentes&quot; (6 July), &quot;Carcassonne festival&quot; (15 July), &quot;Sion Sous Les Etoiles&quot; (18 July), &quot;Poupet&quot; (22 July), &quot;La Fête Du Bruit&quot; (12 August) and &quot;Cabaret Vert&quot; (25 August).

Their 13th album, named &quot;13&quot; (2017) had a big success in France, with singles like &quot;Un été français&quot; or &quot;La vie est belle&quot;.

In 2020 the band announced a new tour to come in 2021 to celebrate their 40 years of career, the &quot;Central Tour&quot;, with 5 dates in the biggest French stadiums, making their 4th Stade de France.

=== 2020s ===
The group released their single &quot;Le chant des cygnes&quot; on June 14, 2024. The release of this title is accompanied by the release of the 14th album on September 7, 2024 and the launch of a 68-date tour in the biggest French and Belgian concert halls.

<text>Holmsund is a locality situated in Umeå Municipality, Västerbotten County, Sweden with 5,489 inhabitants in 2010. It is located 18 km south of the city of Umeå and serves as a port for Umeå.

==Position==
Holmsund lies at the mouth of the Ume River. To the west, across the river estuary, is a town called Obbola, the towns are connected by the E12 road which is carried over the river estuary by the Obbola Bridge. Both Holmsund and Obbola have wood and paper industries. From the southern end of Holmsund a ferry service runs to the Finnish port of Vaasa.

==History==
Swedish water-powered sawmills were under threat when steam power was introduced to Sweden in 1849. The largest Swedish water-powered saw mill was at Baggböle. It was one of the last to close in 1884 when Holmsund built a steam-powered mill. Swedish sawn timber became a major export.

<doc id="996174" wikidata="Q6264023" url="?curid=996174" title="John Stanier (British Army officer)">
<text>Field Marshal Sir John Wilfred Stanier, (6 October 1925 – 10 November 2007) was a senior British Army officer who served as Chief of the General Staff from 1982 to 1985. He was the first person after the Second World War to become the professional head of the British Army without having seen active service in that war or any subsequent campaign.

==Early life and education==
Stanier was born in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, the son of Harold Allan Stanier and Penelope Rose Stanier (née Price). His father was badly wounded in the First World War, but was employed by John Spedan Lewis to manage his farms. He was educated at Marlborough College and took a short wartime course at Merton College, Oxford.

==Military career==
Stanier volunteered for the Army in 1943, and having trained at Sandhurst and Bovington, was commissioned into the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars on 19 April 1946. Promoted to lieutenant on 16 October 1948, he served with the intelligence branch in Italy in 1949 before being posted to the British Army of the Rhine in 1950. He was promoted to captain on 6 October 1952 and became an instructor at the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot in April 1954, before attending the Staff College, Camberley in 1957. Following the merger of his regiment with the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars, he became an officer in the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars in 1958 and was posted to the Directorate of Military Operations at the War Office, before being appointed military assistant to Sir William Stratton, Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff in July 1959. Promoted to major on 6 October 1959, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours 1961. He attended the Joint Services Staff College and, from 1962, commanded the tanks in &quot;C&quot; Squadron of his regiment in Germany, before returning to Camberley as Director of Studies in 1963.

Stainer was not selected to command the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars. Disappointed, he considered leaving the Army, but was pleasantly surprised, having transferred to the Royal Scots Greys on 1 January 1966, to be promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 2 May 1966 and made commanding officer of the Royal Scots Greys. He joined the staff of the Imperial Defence College in December 1968, and was then promoted two ranks to brigadier on 31 December 1969 and took command of 20th Armoured Brigade in the British Army of the Rhine in January 1970. After serving as the Army&#x27;s director of public relations in London from 1971, he was appointed General Officer Commanding 1st Division on 3 November 1973 with the substantive rank of major-general from 21 January 1974. He became Commandant at the Staff College, Camberley on 22 December 1975.

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1978, and became Vice Chief of the General Staff with the rank of lieutenant general on 1 June 1978. The Challenger tank was brought into service during his period in this post. Promoted to full general on 1 January 1981, he was made Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces in April 1981. He became ADC General to the Queen from 7 April 1981, was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1982 and became Chief of the General Staff on 1 August 1982. He was the first person after the Second World War to become the professional head of the British Army without having seen active service in that war or any subsequent campaign. He was promoted to field marshal on 10 July 1985 on retirement from the British Army.

He was also Colonel of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards from 18 January 1979 to 6 May 1984, and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Armoured Corps from 1 April 1982 to 1 August 1985.

In retirement he served as chairman of the Royal United Service Institution from 1986 to 1989. He was Constable of the Tower of London from 1990 to 1996. His book &quot;War and the Media&quot;, co-authored with Miles Hudson, was published in 1997. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire from 1987, and lived near Hartley Wintney.

His interests included fly fishing, sailing and horse riding and he was also President of the Hampshire branch of the British Red Cross Society from 1986 to 1994. He was also a Member of the Council of Marlborough College. He died on 10 November 2007.

==Family==
In 1955 he married Cicely Constance Lambert; they had four daughters.

<text>A veche was a popular assembly during the Middle Ages. The &quot;veche&quot; is mentioned during the times of Kievan Rus&#x27; and it later became a powerful institution in Russian cities such as Novgorod and Pskov, where the &quot;veche&quot; acquired great prominence and was broadly similar to the Norse &quot;thing&quot; or the Swiss &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;. The last &quot;veche&quot; meeting was held in Pskov before the institution was abolished in 1510.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;veche&quot; is a transliteration of the Russian &quot;вече&quot; (), which is in turn inherited from Proto-Slavic (), which is also represented in the word &quot;soviet&quot;, both ultimately deriving from the Proto-Slavic verbal stem of ).

==History==
===Origins===
Procopius of Caesarea mentioned Slavs gathering in popular assemblies in the 6th century:
The &quot;veche&quot; is thought to have originated in the tribal assemblies of Eastern Europe, thus predating the state of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Although most authors have adopted this view, the evidence is not abundant and is mainly based on the statement of Procopius and a few other communications from foreign authors such as Byzantine emperor Maurice&#x27;s &quot;Strategikon&quot;, as well as a few chronicle mentions. The Poliane in Kiev, according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, are said to have consulted among themselves (&quot;s&quot;dumavshe poliane&quot;) before deciding to ultimately pay tribute to the Khazars. The words &quot;duma&quot; and &quot;dumati&quot; are used in later instances to refer to the activities of the &quot;veche&quot;. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; also indicates the recognition of the people as a separate political agent in a 944 treaty with the Byzantine Empire: &quot;And our grand prince Igor and his boyars, and the whole people of Rus have sent us&quot;.

The earliest mentions of the &quot;veche&quot; in chronicles refer to examples in Belgorod in 997, Novgorod in 1016, and Kiev in 1068. A central role of the &quot;veche&quot; is found in the &quot;Suzdal Chronicle&quot; under the year 1176: &quot;From of old the people of Novgorod, of Smolensk, of Kiev, of Polotsk, and of all the lands have assembled for counsel in veches&quot;. Some scholars have used this quote in their argument that the &quot;veche&quot; was a universal occurrence and has immemorial origins. The assemblies discussed matters of war and peace, adopted laws, and called for and expelled rulers. In Kiev, the &quot;veche&quot; was summoned in front of the Cathedral of St. Sophia.

The majority of references to &quot;veche&quot; meetings during the Kievan period is connected with dynastic crises. There are not many references of a &quot;veche&quot; in towns in the 11th century, but there are significantly more in the 12th century, with such references mostly concerning Novgorod and Pskov. Medieval chronicles, such as the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; for Novgorod especially, are the basic source regarding the &quot;veche&quot;. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; remains the main source for the early history of Kievan Rus&#x27;, but its narrative ends at 1116. The next generation of chronicles, including the &quot;Suzdal Chronicle&quot;, are also important sources. Following the Mongol invasions, most references concern Novgorod and Pskov.

=== Russia ===
Most of the information about the &quot;veche&quot; concerns the 13th to 15th centuries. For &quot;veche&quot; proceedings, the &quot;veche&quot; had to be convoked first, often by the prince, but the main topic of the meeting usually was about a conflict between the prince and the population. As a result, there was no regular procedure to be followed, which often led to violence among the participants. There are several mentions of the prince being deposed and the crowd pillaging the residence of the prince. Not much is known about actual proceedings except that the bishop could function as the chairman, while in other instances, the prince could assume this role. The chronicles also mention the existence of a &quot;veche&quot; bell in not only Novgorod and Pskov, but also in Vladimir. Almost all that is known about treaty-making activities of towns concerns Novgorod, and to a lesser extent, Pskov.

During Tatar overlordship, there was little room for &quot;veche&quot; independence. The cities in the northwest were less affected by Tatar overlordship, and so the institution survived longer there. In 1262, &quot;veche&quot; meetings were held in Rostov, Suzdal, Vladimir and Yaroslavl, in which it was decided to throw out the tax collectors sent by the Tatars. In 1304, the citizens of Kostroma and Nizhny Novgorod rebelled against the local aristocracy at the &quot;veche&quot; meetings. There is also a final mention of a &quot;veche&quot; meeting in Moscow in 1382, when Tokhtamysh had launched a campaign against Dmitry Donskoy. The latter had fled to Kostroma while the former had captured Serpukhov near the city of Moscow. Nikolay Karamzin said that the people of Moscow &quot;at the sound of the bells assembled for a &quot;veche&quot;, remembering the ancient right of the Russian citizens to decide their own fate in important situations by a majority of votes&quot;.

==== Vladimir-Suzdal ====
A semi-legendary account of Aleksandr of Suzdal () moving the &quot;veche&quot; bell from Vladimir to his appanage center Suzdal during his reign as grand prince is found in chronicles:

==== Novgorod Republic ====

The Novgorod &quot;veche&quot; was the highest legislative and judicial authority in the city until 1478, after Novgorod was formally annexed by Ivan III. Each of the &quot;kontsy&quot; (boroughs or &quot;ends&quot;) of Novgorod also had their own &quot;veche&quot; to elect borough officials. The &quot;veche&quot; for the city selected the prince, &quot;posadnik&quot; and archbishop.

Historians debate whether the Novgorod &quot;veche&quot; consisted of entirely free males or was instead dominated by a small group of nobles known as boyars. The Novgorod &quot;veche&quot; grew to become more structured in a way that it could be compared to similar bodies in Italian and Flemish towns during the same period. Traditional scholarship argues that a series of reforms in 1410 transformed the &quot;veche&quot; into something similar to the public assembly (&quot;Concio&quot;) of the Republic of Venice; it became the lower chamber of the parliament. An upper chamber knowns as the Council of Lords (&quot;sovet gospod&quot;) was also created which oversaw the &quot;veche&quot;, with title membership for all former city magistrates (&quot;posadniki&quot; and &quot;tysyatskiye&quot;). Some sources indicate that &quot;veche&quot; membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called &quot;vechniki&quot;. Some recent scholars call this interpretation into question.

The Novgorod &quot;veche&quot; could be presumably summoned by anyone who rang the &quot;veche&quot; bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex. The whole population of the city, including boyars, merchants, and common citizens, then gathered in front of the Cathedral of Saint Sophia or at Yaroslav&#x27;s Court on the Trade Side.

Of all other towns of Novgorod Land, the chronicles only mention a &quot;veche&quot; in Torzhok; however they possibly existed in all other towns as well.

==== Pskov Republic ====

The &quot;veche&quot; of the Pskov Republic had legislative powers; it could appoint military commanders and hear ambassadors&#x27; reports. It also approved expenses such as grants to princes and payments to builders of walls, towers and bridges. The &quot;veche&quot; gathered at the court of the Trinity Cathedral, which held the archives of the &quot;veche&quot; and important private papers and state documents. The &quot;veche&quot; assembly included &quot;posadniki&quot; (mayors), &quot;middle&quot; and common people. Historians differ on the extent to which the &quot;veche&quot; was dominated by the elites, with some saying that real power was held in the hands of boyars, with others considering the &quot;veche&quot; to be a democratic institution. Conflicts were common and the confrontation between the &quot;veche&quot; and the &quot;posadniki&quot; in 1483–1484 led to the execution of one &quot;posadnik&quot; and the confiscation of the property of three other &quot;posadniki&quot; who fled to Moscow. The most significant achievement of the Pskov &quot;veche&quot; was the adoption of the Pskov Judicial Charter, likely after 1462, which was the most comprehensive Russian legislation enacted until the Sudebnik of 1497 under Ivan III, the first collection of laws of the unified state.

The unification of Russia gave rise to a new political system characterized by the dominance of the grand prince, who viewed the country as his personal patrimony and dismantled traditional institutions like the &quot;veche&quot;. In the autumn of 1509, Grand Prince Vasily III visited Novgorod, where he received complaints from the Pskov &quot;veche&quot; against the Muscovite governor of the city. At first, Vasily encouraged complaints against the governor, but soon demanded that the city abolish its traditional institutions, including the removal of the &quot;veche&quot; bell. From that point on, Pskov was to be ruled exclusively by his governors and officials, and on 13 January 1510, the &quot;veche&quot; bell was removed and transported to Moscow.

===Poland===

The &quot;veche&quot;, known in Poland as &quot;wiec&quot;, were convened even before the beginning of the Polish statehood in the Kingdom of Poland. Issues were first debated by the elders and leaders, and later presented to all the free men for a wider discussion.

One of the major types of &quot;wiec&quot; was the one convened to choose a new ruler. There are legends of a 9th-century election of the legendary founder of the Piast dynasty, Piast the Wheelwright, and a similar election of his son, Siemowit, but sources for that time come from the later centuries and their validity is disputed by scholars. The election privilege was usually limited to the elites, which in the later times took the form of the most powerful nobles (magnates, princes) or officials, and was heavily influenced by local traditions and strength of the ruler. By the 12th or 13th century, the &quot;wiec&quot; institution likewise limited its participation to high ranking nobles and officials. The nationwide gatherings of &quot;wiec&quot; officials in 1306 and 1310 can be seen as precursors of the Polish parliament (the General Sejm).

<text>x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.

In the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor&#x27;s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.

== Software-based virtualization ==
The following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode.

In protected mode the operating system kernel runs at a higher privilege such as ring 0, and applications at a lower privilege such as ring 3. In software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest OSs have limited access to hardware, just like any other application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to overcome this limitation is called &quot;ring deprivileging&quot;, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0.

Three techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible:
* Binary translation is used to rewrite certain ring 0 instructions in terms of ring 3 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0, making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible. To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code.
* A number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as &quot;shadow page tables&quot;. This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. &quot;Shadow descriptor tables&quot; must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS.
* I/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS.

These techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370.

On traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor).

There has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg. VMware researchers pointed out in a 2006 ASPLOS paper that the above techniques made the x86 platform virtualizable in the sense of meeting the three criteria of Popek and Goldberg, albeit not by the classic trap-and-emulate technique.

A different route was taken by other systems like Denali, L4, and Xen, known as paravirtualization, which involves porting operating systems to run on the resulting virtual machine, which does not implement the parts of the actual x86 instruction set that are hard to virtualize. The paravirtualized I/O has significant performance benefits as demonstrated in the original SOSP&#x27;03 Xen paper.

The initial version of x86-64 (AMD64) did not allow for a software-only full virtualization due to the lack of segmentation support in long mode, which made the protection of the hypervisor&#x27;s memory impossible, in particular, the protection of the trap handler that runs in the guest kernel address space. Revision D and later 64-bit AMD processors (as a rule of thumb, those manufactured in 90 nm or less) added basic support for segmentation in long mode, making it possible to run 64-bit guests in 64-bit hosts via binary translation. Intel did not add segmentation support to its x86-64 implementation (Intel 64), making 64-bit software-only virtualization impossible on Intel CPUs, but Intel VT-x support makes 64-bit hardware assisted virtualization possible on the Intel platform.

On some platforms, it is possible to run a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit host OS if the underlying processor is 64-bit and supports the necessary virtualization extensions.

== Hardware-assisted virtualization ==
In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD (working independently) created new processor extensions to the x86 architecture. The first generation of x86 hardware virtualization addressed the issue of privileged instructions. The issue of low performance of virtualized system memory was addressed with MMU virtualization that was added to the chipset later.

=== Central processing unit ===

==== Virtual 8086 mode ====
Because the Intel 80286 could not run concurrent DOS applications well by itself in protected mode, Intel introduced the virtual 8086 mode in their 80386 chip, which offered virtualized 8086 processors on the 386 and later chips. Hardware support for virtualizing the protected mode itself, however, became available 20 years later.

==== AMD virtualization (AMD-V) ====
AMD developed its first generation virtualization extensions under the code name &quot;Pacifica&quot;, and initially published them as AMD Secure Virtual Machine (SVM), but later marketed them under the trademark &quot;AMD Virtualization&quot;, abbreviated &quot;AMD-V&quot;.

On May 23, 2006, AMD released the Athlon 64 (&quot;Orleans&quot;), the Athlon 64 X2 (&quot;Windsor&quot;) and the Athlon 64 FX (&quot;Windsor&quot;) as the first AMD processors to support this technology.

AMD-V capability also features on the Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 X2 family of processors with revisions &quot;F&quot; or &quot;G&quot; on socket AM2, Turion 64 X2, and Opteron 2nd generation and third-generation, Phenom and Phenom II processors. The APU Fusion processors support AMD-V. AMD-V is not supported by any Socket 939 processors. The only Sempron processors which support it are APUs and Huron, Regor, Sargas desktop CPUs.

AMD Opteron CPUs beginning with the Family 0x10 Barcelona line, and Phenom II CPUs, support a second generation hardware virtualization technology called Rapid Virtualization Indexing (formerly known as Nested Page Tables during its development), later adopted by Intel as Extended Page Tables (EPT).

As of 2019, all Zen-based AMD processors support AMD-V.

The CPU flag for AMD-V is &quot;svm&quot;. This may be checked in BSD derivatives via dmesg or sysctl and in Linux via codice_1. Instructions in AMD-V include VMRUN, VMLOAD, VMSAVE, CLGI, VMMCALL, INVLPGA, SKINIT, and STGI.

With some motherboards, users must enable AMD SVM feature in the BIOS setup before applications can make use of it.

==== Intel virtualization (VT-x) ====

Previously codenamed &quot;Vanderpool&quot;, VT-x represents Intel&#x27;s technology for virtualization on the x86 platform. On November 14, 2005, Intel released two models of Pentium 4 (Model 662 and 672) as the first Intel processors to support VT-x. The CPU flag for VT-x capability is &quot;vmx&quot;; in Linux, this can be checked via codice_2, or in macOS via codice_3.

&quot;VMX&quot; stands for Virtual Machine Extensions, which adds 13 new instructions: VMPTRLD, VMPTRST, VMCLEAR, VMREAD, VMWRITE, VMCALL, VMLAUNCH, VMRESUME, VMXOFF, VMXON, INVEPT, INVVPID, and VMFUNC. These instructions permit entering and exiting a virtual execution mode where the guest OS perceives itself as running with full privilege (ring 0), but the host OS remains protected.

, almost all newer server, desktop and mobile Intel processors support VT-x, with some of the Intel Atom processors as the primary exception. With some motherboards, users must enable Intel&#x27;s VT-x feature in the BIOS setup before applications can make use of it.

Intel started to include Extended Page Tables (EPT), a technology for page-table virtualization, since the Nehalem architecture, released in 2008. In 2010, Westmere added support for launching the logical processor directly in real mode a feature called &quot;unrestricted guest&quot;, which requires EPT to work.

Since the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include &quot;VMCS shadowing&quot; as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization of VMMs.
The &quot;virtual machine control structure&quot; (VMCS) is a data structure in memory that exists exactly once per VM, while it is managed by the VMM. With every change of the execution context between different VMs, the VMCS is restored for the current VM, defining the state of the VM&#x27;s virtual processor. As soon as more than one VMM or nested VMMs are used, a problem appears in a way similar to what required shadow page table management to be invented, as described above. In such cases, VMCS needs to be shadowed multiple times (in case of nesting) and partially implemented in software in case there is no hardware support by the processor. To make shadow VMCS handling more efficient, Intel implemented hardware support for VMCS shadowing.

==== VIA virtualization (VIA VT) ====
VIA Nano 3000 Series Processors and higher support VIA VT virtualization technology compatible with Intel VT-x. EPT is present in Zhaoxin ZX-C, a descendant of VIA QuadCore-E &amp; Eden X4 similar to Nano C4350AL.

==== Interrupt virtualization (AMD AVIC and Intel APICv) ====
In 2012, AMD announced their &quot;Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller&quot; (&quot;AVIC&quot;) targeting interrupt overhead reduction in virtualization environments. This technology, as announced, does not support x2APIC.
In 2016, AVIC is available on the AMD family 15h models 6Xh
(Carrizo) processors and newer.

Also in 2012, Intel announced a similar technology for interrupt and APIC virtualization, which did not have a brand name at its announcement time.
Later, it was branded as &quot;APIC virtualization&quot; (&quot;APICv&quot;)
and it became commercially available in the Ivy Bridge EP series of Intel CPUs, which is sold as Xeon E5-26xx v2 (launched in late 2013) and as Xeon E5-46xx v2 (launched in early 2014).

=== Graphics processing unit ===
Graphics virtualization is not part of the x86 architecture. Intel Graphics Virtualization Technology (GVT) provides graphics virtualization as part of more recent Gen graphics architectures. Although AMD APUs implement the x86-64 instruction set, they implement AMD&#x27;s own graphics architectures (TeraScale, GCN and RDNA) which do not support graphics virtualization. Larrabee was the only graphics microarchitecture based on x86, but it likely did not include support for graphics virtualization.

=== Chipset ===
Memory and I/O virtualization is performed by the chipset. Typically these features must be enabled by the BIOS, which must be able to support them and also be set to use them.

==== I/O MMU virtualization (AMD-Vi and Intel VT-d) ====
An input/output memory management unit (IOMMU) allows guest virtual machines to directly use peripheral devices, such as Ethernet, accelerated graphics cards, and hard-drive controllers, through DMA and interrupt remapping. This is sometimes called &quot;PCI passthrough&quot;.

An IOMMU also allows operating systems to eliminate bounce buffers needed to allow themselves to communicate with peripheral devices whose memory address spaces are smaller than the operating system&#x27;s memory address space, by using memory address translation. At the same time, an IOMMU also allows operating systems and hypervisors to prevent buggy or malicious hardware from compromising memory security.
Both AMD and Intel have released their IOMMU specifications:
* AMD&#x27;s I/O Virtualization Technology, &quot;AMD-Vi&quot;, originally called &quot;IOMMU&quot;
* Intel&#x27;s &quot;Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O&quot; (VT-d), included in most high-end (but not all) newer Intel processors since the Core 2 architecture.

In addition to the CPU support, both motherboard chipset and system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) need to fully support the IOMMU I/O virtualization functionality for it to be usable. Only the PCI or PCI Express devices supporting &quot;function level reset&quot; (FLR) can be virtualized this way, as it is required for reassigning various device functions between virtual machines. If a device to be assigned does not support Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI), it must not share interrupt lines with other devices for the assignment to be possible.
All conventional PCI devices routed behind a PCI/PCI-X-to-PCI Express bridge can be assigned to a guest virtual machine only all at once; PCI Express devices have no such restriction.

==== Network virtualization (VT-c) ====
* Intel&#x27;s &quot;Virtualization Technology for Connectivity&quot; (VT-c).

===== PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) =====

&quot;PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)&quot; provides a set of general (non-x86 specific) I/O virtualization methods based on PCI Express (PCIe) native hardware, as standardized by PCI-SIG:

* &quot;Address translation services (ATS)&quot; supports native IOV across PCI Express via address translation. It requires support for new transactions to configure such translations.
* &quot;Single-root IOV (SR-IOV or SRIOV)&quot; supports native IOV in existing single-root complex PCI Express topologies. It requires support for new device capabilities to configure multiple virtualized configuration spaces.
* &quot;Multi-root IOV (MR-IOV)&quot; supports native IOV in new topologies (for example, blade servers) by building on SR-IOV to provide multiple root complexes which share a common PCI Express hierarchy.

In SR-IOV, the most common of these, a host VMM configures supported devices to create and allocate virtual &quot;shadows&quot; of their configuration spaces so that virtual machine guests can directly configure and access such &quot;shadow&quot; device resources. With SR-IOV enabled, virtualized network interfaces are directly accessible to the guests,
avoiding involvement of the VMM and resulting in high overall performance; for example, SR-IOV achieves over 95% of the bare metal network bandwidth in NASA&#x27;s virtualized datacenter and in the Amazon Public Cloud.

<text>Zinka Milanov (; May 17, 1906 – May 30, 1989) was a Croatian operatic dramatic soprano who had a major career centered on the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. After finishing her education in Zagreb, Milanov made her debut in 1927 in Ljubljana as Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s Il Trovatore. From 1928 to 1936, she was the leading soprano of the Croatian National Theatre. In 1937, Milanov performed at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time, where she continued to sing until 1966. She also performed as a concert singer and was a noted vocal coach and teacher. Milanov is the sister of the composer and pianist Božidar Kunc.

==Biography==
Born in Zagreb, Croatia as Zinka Kunc (), she studied with the Wagnerian soprano Milka Ternina and her assistant Marija Kostrenčić. She also studied in Milan with Carpi and in Berlin with Stückgolt. On October 29, 1927, she made her operatic debut as Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; in Ljubljana, Slovenia, at age 21. Her debut in her native Croatia, at the National Theatre in Zagreb, took place five weeks later as Marguerite in Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;.

After an early debut in Dresden (November 5, 1928, also as Leonora), her teacher, Ternina, was not pleased and much work commenced to perfect her technique. She performed in Zagreb and Ljubljana almost exclusively for the next six years. Later she became a member of the New German Theatre in Prague, where all performances were sung in German. She was discovered there by Bruno Walter, who recommended her to Arturo Toscanini for a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in Salzburg.

In 1937, the soprano made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, once again as Leonora. At that time she adopted the name Milanov, the stage name of her second husband, an actor. According to Milanov herself, &quot;Kunc&quot; wasn&#x27;t &quot;glamorous&quot; enough for the Metropolitan Opera. The 2004 &quot;Opera News&quot; article &quot;Zinka Takes Off&quot; stated that the name change was deemed necessary since the gentlemen at the Met feared the &quot;implications inherent in what they predicted would be the standard American mispronunciation — but they were never forthright with her about it&quot;. On November 8, 1937, Erich Simon, who was in charge of engaging Milanov, cabled Edward Ziegler, the assistant manager of the Met, &quot;Mme Zinka KUNZ-MARCOVIC has informed me that she wishes to perform under her husband&#x27;s stage name, MILANOV.&quot; 

In 1940, Milanov was one of the featured soloists in a radio performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, along with Jussi Björling (tenor), Alexander Kipnis (bass), Bruna Castagna (mezzo), and the Westminster Choir. Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra.

In 1947, she left the Met when she married, for the third time, to Yugoslav general and diplomat Ljubomir Ilić, and returned to live in Yugoslavia. She was at the peak of her artistic and vocal powers when she made her debut at the Teatro alla Scala as Tosca in 1950. Milanov returned to the Metropolitan Opera the same year, invited by Rudolf Bing in his first year there as general manager.

She gave her final performance in 1966 at the closing night of the old Metropolitan Opera House. Having worked as a voice teacher while still performing, Milanov devoted herself to teaching after her retirement. Among her pupils were Betty Allen, Grace Bumbry, Christa Ludwig, Regina Resnik, Dubravka Zubovic and Milka Stojanovic. Composer Richard Hundley was one of her studio pianists. She recorded prolifically from the 1940s through to the 1960s. Her voice was well-suited to Italian operas such as those of Verdi, Ponchielli, Puccini and the verismo composers. She died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on May 30, 1989, following a stroke, aged 83.

<text>André Lallemand (; September 29, 1904 – March 24, 1978) was a French astronomer and director of the Institut d&#x27;Astrophysique de Paris.

Lallemand made important contributions to the development of photomultipliers for astronomical use and the &quot;electronic telescope&quot; (or Lallemand camera). He was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1938 and the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1962 for his work.

Lallemand was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1960-1962. 

The crater Lallemand on the Moon is named in his honor, and the French Academy of Sciences has a biennial award for work in astronomy called the &quot;Prix Lallemand&quot;.

<text>SAR Records was a record company founded by soul music legend Sam Cooke in 1961. The meaning of &quot;SAR&quot; has been disputed; it has been listed as &quot;Sam &amp; Alex Records&quot; (J.W. Alexander was Cooke&#x27;s business, song-writing associate, and friend) and also as &quot;Sam, Alex, &amp; Roy Records&quot; (Roy being S. R. Crain, Cooke&#x27;s mentor from his Soul Stirrers days, as well as his pop road manager).

The label did not feature Cooke, but rather featured all of Cooke&#x27;s artists such as the latter-day Soul Stirrers with Jimmie Outler and Johnnie Taylor singing lead, The Valentinos (including Bobby Womack), Billy Preston, Mel Carter, The Simms Twins, Johnnie Morisette, L. C. Cooke (Cooke&#x27;s younger brother), as well as Johnnie Taylor as a pop soloist.

One notable release on SAR was the original version of &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot; by The Valentinos which would later be covered by the Rolling Stones.

The label was intended to be a place where Sam Cooke could expand his artistic abilities as a writer/producer and to give other struggling African-American artists a venue to record during the racially charged 1960&#x27;s. Cooke did record two songs on the label, however, that have only been released since 2001: the solo side of his gospel song &quot;That&#x27;s Heaven to Me&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere There&#x27;s a Girl&quot; (a secular version of The Valentino&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere There&#x27;s a God&quot;).

The label folded after Sam Cooke&#x27;s death on December 11, 1964.

A 2-CD compilation, &quot;Sam Cooke&#x27;s SAR Records Story 1959–1965&quot;, was released in 1994 by ABKCO Records.

<doc id="996205" wikidata="Q6070295" url="?curid=996205" title="Iris Wildthyme">
<text>Iris Wildthyme is a fictional character created by writer Paul Magrs, who has appeared in short stories, novels and audio dramas from numerous publishers. She is best known from spin-off media based on the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, where she is sometimes depicted as a renegade Time Lord.

Her stories are in the New Wave mold, characterised by nonlinear, sometimes stream of consciousness narrative, intertextual references to the rest of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and popular culture, and themes of unreliable narration. She has a playful, mischievous personality, delighting in baiting the Doctor and getting into trouble.

==History==
Iris Wildthyme first appears in one of Magrs&#x27;s non-genre novels, &quot;Marked for Life&quot;, as a lesbian novelist who has lived for far longer than a normal lifespan. At the end of the novel, Iris Wildthyme seems to die and then become a baby in a scene reminiscent of regeneration. The infant Iris appears in later books by Magrs taking place in the same Phoenix Court setting, and an apparently adult version re-appears in the story &quot;Hospitality&quot;, in the collection &quot;Iris: Abroad&quot;.

Iris&#x27;s first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; appearance is in the short story &quot;Old Flames&quot;, where she meets the Fourth Doctor and Sarah. The Doctor already knows Iris as an &quot;old friend&quot;, and she is seen to be travelling in a 20th-century London AEC Routemaster double-decker bus (the route 22 to Putney Common), which is, in reality, her TARDIS.

The character was described as &quot;a studied affront&quot; to existing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; texts and &quot;an ethical challenge&quot; to some of the series&#x27; &quot;main inconsistencies&quot;. In 2011, &quot;SFX&quot; called Iris Wildthyme one of the &#x27;Top 5 Spinoff Companions&#x27; and said &#x27;her adventures (with the Doctor, and in her own line of books) are a joy&#x27;.

Iris was featured at length in &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; and &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, and went on to appear in several more short stories and novels in the BBC Books range, most recently &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; in 2002.

Since then the character has been the subject of a number of short story anthologies, edited by Magrs and others, published by Obverse Books and one by Big Finish Productions, and two novels published by Snowbooks.

In 2001, Philip Purser-Hallard submitted a proposal for a novel, &quot;Iris Wildthyme in the City of the Saved&quot;, which would have seen Iris in a hedonistic artificial world at the end of time where all people are resurrected and made immortal. It was rejected as an Iris Wildthyme novel range was considered unviable at the time. Purser-Hallard reused elements of the story in 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the War&quot; (in which Iris appears as an unnamed traveller) and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Of the City of the Saved...&quot;.

In 2002, the character started appearing as an occasional crossover character in audio plays by Big Finish Productions, where she is voiced by Katy Manning. Following the casting of Manning in the role, imagery of the character used by Big Finish (and, later, Obverse Books) on packaging and covers now depicts Manning&#x27;s likeness.

The character has appeared as the main character in five &quot;seasons&quot; of audio dramas, released respectively in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2015, along with a 2009 Christmas special. Each release of the second season is a pastiche of a decade of televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, from the 1960s through to the 1990s. The 2012 release &quot;Iris Rides Out&quot; is a crossover with the out-of-copyright character Carnacki the Ghost-Finder.

Although in some of her early appearances (including &quot;Verdigris&quot; and &quot;Wildthyme on Top&quot;) Iris is accompanied by her companion Tom (played on audio by Ortis Deley), her usual foil in her Big Finish, Obverse Books and Snowbooks appearances is Panda, a 10-inch-tall sentient, stuffed toy (played on audio by David Benson).

==Character==
Iris claims to have been raised by a House of Aunts (as opposed to Cousins), in the mountains of southern Gallifrey, and also that she has erased all of her records from the Matrix, explaining why the Time Lords know nothing about her. She is known to have survived the destruction of Gallifrey and the apparent retroactive wiping of the Time Lords from history that took place at the end of the novel &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot;.

Iris regenerates at the end of &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; (into a form resembling Jane Fonda in &quot;Barbarella&quot;), and is known to have at least six other incarnations. One of these, Bianca (voiced by Maria McErlane), appears in the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;The Wormery&quot; and is similar to the Doctor&#x27;s villainous Valeyard incarnation. Iris has also apparently worked for UNIT as a Scientific Advisor, and for the Ministry of Incursions and Ontological Wonders (MIAOW).

There is no indication of what relationship the character has with the new television series. In &quot;The End of the World&quot; (2005), the Doctor states that his homeworld had been destroyed and that he is the last of the Time Lords.

Attempting to pin down the exact details of Iris&#x27;s history is problematic because such details are not only kept deliberately vague by Magrs and other writers, but also because the accounts of her adventures may not be reliable, in whole or in part. For example, some of her claimed exploits bear a remarkable similarity to those of the Doctor&#x27;s, and some have suggested that it is the Doctor&#x27;s adventures that are plagiarised from Iris&#x27;s life, rather than the other way around.

Her TARDIS is a double-decker red London bus, the number 22 to Putney Common. In contrast with other TARDISes, hers is slightly smaller on the inside, a fact attributed to the fact that her TARDIS was dying when she found it. She also claims to have stolen the TARDIS, and to be on the run from her &quot;mysterious superiors&quot;.

Iris has also argued that her adventures are more &quot;true&quot; than the Doctor&#x27;s recollections because she writes them in her diaries while the Doctor does not. Magrs has explicitly stated that Iris &quot;knows — of course she knows — that she&#x27;s a very deliberate parody of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. That&#x27;s why she loves him so.&quot; In postmodernist style, Iris is portrayed as playfully aware that she is a character in a television programme (or a series of books and audio dramas spun off from a television programme). Even more so than the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS, Iris&#x27;s bus is a device for moving her between fictional genres and even texts. In the context of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe, all this may be explained by Iris&#x27;s claim in the novel &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; that she is from the Obverse, a surreal parallel universe with radically different physical laws. More recently in both Big Finish audios and Obverse Books short stories, she has claimed to come from The Clockworks, a planet in the Obverse, ruled over by a race not unlike the Time Lords.

<doc id="996206" wikidata="Q5196608" url="?curid=996206" title="Cut-to-length logging">
<text>Cut-to-length logging (CTL) is a mechanized harvesting system in which trees are delimbed and &quot;cut to length&quot; directly at the stump. CTL is typically a two-man, two-machine operation with a harvester felling, delimbing, and bucking trees and a forwarder transporting the logs from the felling to a landing area close to a road accessible by trucks.

CTL is the primary logging method in European countries, while full-tree logging and the even older technique of tree-length logging are more popular in North America and less developed countries, where tree sizes can exceed the capacity of the harvester&#x27;s felling head, i.e., tree stems with a butt diameter of over 90 centimeters. CTL lends itself to timber harvesting in plantation forestry where stems are often harvested before they reach large dimensions.

==Advantages compared to full-tree logging==
*Cleaner wood since the logs are not skidded on the ground to the landing (in tree length more than full tree)
*More fresh wood (in tree length more than full tree)
*Less damage to retained trees in thinning operations
*Typically requires fewer types of machines in an operation
*No need to clear large landings close to the road
*Greater personnel safety due to enclosed/protected machine cabs
*More environmentally friendly due to:
**less soil disturbance than in skidding operations (if improper skidding practices take place) 
**no slash dumped at the landing
**higher retention of foliar nutrients within the harvested area

==Disadvantages compared to full-tree logging==
*Somewhat higher capital cost per volume when used in large scale clear cuts
*Use of more advanced technology requires more operator knowledge and training

==Cost==
The capital costs for a typical CTL operation, with one harvester and one forwarder, are quite high. The price of a pair of machines alone are approx. US$1,000,000.

<doc id="996208" wikidata="Q232695" url="?curid=996208" title="Princess Birgitta of Sweden">
<text>Princess Birgitta of Sweden (Birgitta Ingeborg Alice; 19 January 1937 – 4 December 2024) was a member of the Swedish royal family. She was the second child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and an elder sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf.

From 1961, she was a member of the Swabian branch of the deposed House of Hohenzollern by her marriage to Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern.

==Early life==

Born at Haga Palace in Stockholm, Birgitta was the second child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and a granddaughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf. She and her three sisters were affectionately called &quot;Hagasessorna&quot; (the Haga Princesses). She was 10 years old when her father was killed in the 1947 KLM Douglas DC-3 Copenhagen disaster.

At the age of 14, Birgitta was educated at Franska Skolan in Stockholm, followed by a stay at a Swiss boarding school. Prior to that, she and her sisters had been homeschooled at Stockholm Palace. In 1958, she graduated with a degree in movement sciences from Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences and subsequently worked as a gymnastics teacher at Broms School in Östermalm.

==Public life==
In November 1960, Birgitta visited the United States accompanied by her younger sister Princess Désirée on behalf of their grandfather King Gustaf VI Adolf for the 50th anniversary of The American-Scandinavian Foundation. In their honour a ball was organised for the two princesses at the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel in Chicago by Mayor Richard Daley.

Princess Birgitta was involved with golf and charities outside of Sweden and was an honorary board member of the (British) Royal Swedish Golfing Society, a position she took over when her uncle Prince Bertil died. She had her own golf competition in Majorca, the Princess Birgitta Trophy, at her home golf course.

In 1997, Birgitta published her memoir &quot;Min egen väg&quot; and on Christmas Day 2022, Sweden&#x27;s national public service Sveriges Television broadcast a recent hour-long documentary and interview with the princess where she detailed her often troubled life as a Swedish royal.

==Marriage==

In the fall of 1959, Birgitta moved to Munich, Germany, to study German. Here she met Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern at a cocktail party. Their engagement was announced on 15 December 1960.

The couple were married in a civil ceremony in the Hall of State of the Royal Palace of Stockholm on 25 May 1961. The bride&#x27;s grandfather, King Gustaf VI Adolf, had hoped for a Lutheran ceremony, but Pope John XXIII forbade this. The bridesmaids were the bride’s sister Princess Christina and cousin Princess Benedikte of Denmark; the groomsmen were the bride&#x27;s brother Crown Prince Carl Gustaf and her cousin Count Michael Bernadotte of Wisborg (son of Sigvard Bernadotte). She wore Empress Josephine&#x27;s cameo diadem, thus becoming the first in a line of Swedish princesses to do so, as well as her great-grandmother Queen Sofia&#x27;s lace veil which was also worn by her mother, Princess Sibylla, on her wedding day in 1932.

A Roman Catholic ceremony was held at Sankt Johann Church at the groom&#x27;s family seat of Sigmaringen, Germany, on 30 May 1961. Birgitta applied to convert to Roman Catholicism when she married the Hohenzollern prince, but her application was rejected in wording which questioned her spiritual commitment to the change.

The couple had three children:
* Prince &quot;Carl Christian&quot; Friedrich Johannes Meinrad Maria Hubertus Edmund of Hohenzollern (born 5 April 1962 in Munich, Germany), married Nicole Helene Neschitsch (born 22 January 1968 in Munich) on 26 July 1999 in Kreuzpullach. They have one son:
** Prince &quot;Nicolas&quot; Johann Georg Maria of Hohenzollern (born 22 November 1999)
* Princess &quot;Désirée&quot; Margareta Victoria Louise Sibylla Katharina Maria of Hohenzollern (born 27 November 1963 in Munich). She married Heinrich Franz Josef Georg Maria, Imperial Count of Ortenburg (born 11 October 1956 in Bamberg) on 21 September 1998 in Weitramsdorf. They had three children before divorcing in 2002. Then she married Eckbert Georg Klaus von Bohlen und Halbach (born 24 March 1956)
** &quot;Carl-Theodor&quot; Philip Georg Maria, Hereditary Count of Ortenburg (born 21 February 1992 in Lichtenfels)
** Count &quot;Frederik-Hubertus&quot; Ferdinand Maria of Ortenburg (born 7 February 1995 in Lichtenfels)
** Countess &quot;Carolina&quot; Maria Franziska Christina Stephanie of Ortenburg (born 23 March 1997)
* Prince &quot;Hubertus&quot; Gustav Adolf Veit Georg Meinrad Maria Alexander of Hohenzollern (born 10 June 1966 in Munich), who served as page boy at the 1976 wedding of his uncle, King Carl XVI Gustaf. He married Uta Maria König (born 25 February 1964 in Trier). They had two children:
** Prince &quot;Lennart&quot; Carl Christian of Hohenzollern (January 10 2001 – January 14 2001)
** Princess &quot;Vivianne&quot; of Hohenzollern (born May 2009)

Birgitta and Johann Georg separated in 1990, although they remained married. She moved to the island of Mallorca in Spain in the 1990s, while her husband continued to live in Munich until his death in 2016.

The Princess and her children were passed over for succession to the Swedish throne when subsequent absolute primogeniture was established in Sweden in 1979 and 1980, and then only included her brother&#x27;s descendants and her uncle Prince Bertil. However, as the only one of her sisters to marry a man of princely status, Princess Birgitta retained her Swedish style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

Birgitta was the godmother of her nephew, Prince Carl Philip – at the time of his christening, the heir apparent to the Swedish throne.

==Death==
On 4 December 2024, the Swedish Royal Court announced that Princess Birgitta had died earlier that day in Mallorca, Spain, at the age of 87. The cause of death was later revealed to be a fall. A private funeral was held on 15 December 2024 in the palace church at Drottningholm Palace. She was buried in the Royal Burial Ground in Hagaparken.

As Princess Birgitta was a member of the Order of the Seraphim, the Seraphim toll at Riddarholmen Church was rung on the day of her funeral.

<text>Paul Ledoux (8 August 1914 – 6 October 1988) was a Belgian astrophysicist best known for his work on stellar stability and variability. With Theodore Walraven, he co-authored a seminal work on stellar oscillations. In 1964 Ledoux was awarded the Francqui Prize for Exact Sciences, and was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1972 for investigations into problems of stellar stability and variable stars. He was awarded the Janssen Medal of the French Academy of Sciences in 1976.

== Ledoux criterion ==

In stellar astrophysics, Ledoux&#x27;s name is now associated with the criterion under which material in a star becomes unstable to convection in the presence of a gradient of chemical composition. In homogeneous material, the Schwarzschild criterion shows that material is unstable to convection if the radiation field alone would establish a steeper temperature gradient steeper than the adiabatic (or isentropic) temperature gradient. However, Ledoux showed that a composition gradient stabilises or destabilises the material against convection. In convectively-stable regions destabilised by the composition gradient, one expects &quot;thermohaline mixing&quot;; in convectively-unstable regions that are stabilised, one expects double-diffusive mixing, known in stellar astrophysics as &quot;semiconvection&quot;.

<text>John Stanier is an American drummer who is best known for his work with alternative metal band Helmet. He currently plays in experimental rock band Battles and has previously performed with Tomahawk and The Mark of Cain, as well as performing on several releases as a studio musician.

He is known for his speed, endurance, and precision as a performer. Stanier uses a Tama Artstar II drum kit.

== Biography ==

Stanier grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Florida and is a veteran of the local hardcore music scene. He is known for having a drum corps background, but never actually marched a summer season. He played tenor drums for the Florida Wave Drum and Bugle Corps through a few years of their winter/spring camps. He studied orchestral percussion at the University of South Florida, but never took formal drum set lessons. Stanier cites Neil Peart as his biggest influence. He has also been influenced by drummers such as John Bonham, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio, Carl Palmer, and Lenny White. Stanier&#x27;s drumming with Helmet has been cited as a big influence on a new generation of rock drummers. He endorses Tama drums, and is also well known for his Zildjian &quot;K&quot; crash cymbal perched as high as it can go when playing with Battles.

The breakup of Helmet in 1998 was supposedly amicable, though Stanier offers few details beyond: &quot;There&#x27;s no big story or anything. It was just... time to call it a day. We&#x27;d been around for 10 years... no drama or fights or anything like that.&quot; Stanier has not kept in contact with former band mates Page Hamilton and Henry Bogdan, and Hamilton has commented that Stanier ignored attempts to communicate. With Helmet firmly in the past, Stanier wanted to get involved with other projects after taking some time off. A big fan of hip-hop music, he &quot;accidentally&quot; became a professional DJ for a year and a half. The length of his drumming inactivity was in part due to a broken wrist, as well as the fact that he simply could not find a band he wanted to play with. Since 2000, Stanier has been much more active with drumming. He is currently a member of three bands: Battles, Tomahawk, and The Mark of Cain.

<doc id="996227" wikidata="Q5754751" url="?curid=996227" title="High-test peroxide">
<text>High-test peroxide (HTP) is a highly concentrated (85 to 98%) solution of hydrogen peroxide, with the remainder consisting predominantly of water. In contact with a catalyst, it decomposes into a high-temperature mixture of steam and oxygen, with no remaining liquid water. It was used as a propellant of HTP rockets and torpedoes, and has been used for high-performance vernier engines.

==Properties==
Hydrogen peroxide works best as a propellant in extremely high concentrations (roughly over 70%). Although any concentration of peroxide will generate some hot gas (oxygen plus some steam), at concentrations above approximately 67%, the heat of decomposing hydrogen peroxide becomes large enough to completely vaporize all the liquid at standard pressure. This represents a safety and utilization turning point, since decomposition of any concentration above this amount is capable of transforming the liquid entirely to heated gas (the higher the concentration, the hotter the resulting gas). This very hot steam/oxygen mixture can then be used to generate maximal thrust, power, or work, but it also makes explosive decomposition of the material far more hazardous.

Normal propellant-grade concentrations, therefore, vary from 70 to 98%, with common grades of 70, 85, 90, and 98%.

The volume change of peroxide due to freezing varies with percentage. Lower concentrations of peroxide (45% or less) will expand when frozen, while higher concentrations (65% or greater) will contract.

Hydrogen peroxide becomes more stable with higher peroxide content. For example, 98% hydrogen peroxide is more stable than 70% hydrogen peroxide. Water acts as a contaminant, and the higher the water concentration the less stable the peroxide is. The storability of peroxide is dependent on the surface-to-volume ratio of the materials the fluid is in contact with. To increase storability, the ratio should be minimized.

==Applications==
When used with a suitable catalyst, HTP can be used as a monopropellant, or with a separate fuel as a bipropellant.

HTP has been used safely and successfully in many applications, beginning with German usage during World War II, and continues to the present day. During World War II, high-test peroxide was used as an oxidizer in some German bipropellant rocket designs, such as the Walter HWK 509A rocket engine that powered the Messerschmitt Me 163 point defense interceptor fighter late in World War II, comprising 80% of the standardized mixture &quot;T-Stoff&quot;, and also in the German Type XVII submarine.

Some significant United States programs include the reaction control thrusters on the X-15 program, and the Bell Rocket Belt. The NASA Lunar Lander Research Vehicle used it for rocket thrust to simulate a lunar lander.

The Royal Navy experimented with HTP as the oxidiser in the experimental high-speed target/training submarines and between 1958 and 1969.

The first Russian HTP torpedo was known by the strictly functional name of 53-57, the 53 referring to the diameter in centimeters of the torpedo tube, the 57 to the year it was introduced. Driven by the Cold War competition, they ordered the development of a larger HTP torpedo, to be fired from the 65-centimeter (26-inch) tubes. HTP in one of these Type 65 torpedoes on August 12, 2000 exploded on board and sank the K-141 &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine.

British experiments with HTP as a torpedo fuel were discontinued after a peroxide fire resulted in the loss of the submarine in 1956.

British experimentation with HTP continued in rocketry research, ending with the Black Arrow launch vehicles in 1971. Black Arrow rockets successfully launched the Prospero X-3 satellite from Woomera, South Australia using HTP and kerosene fuel.

The British Blue Steel missile, attached to Vulcan and Victor bombers, in the 1960s, was produced by AVRO. It used 85% concentration of HTP. To light the twin chamber Stentor rocket, HTP passed through a catalyst screen. Kerosene was then injected into the two chambers to produce of thrust each. The larger chamber was for climbing and accelerating, while the small chamber was to maintain cruise speed. The missile had a range of 100 nautical miles when launched at high altitude and about 50 nautical miles launched at low level (). Its speed was about Mach 2.0. After a high altitude launch it would climb to . From a low level launch, it would climb to only but its speed would still be around Mach 2.0

With concentration of 82%, it is still in use on the Russian Soyuz rocket to drive the turbopumps on the boosters and on the orbital vehicle.

The Blue Flame rocket-powered vehicle achieved the world land speed record of on October 23, 1970, using a combination of high-test peroxide and liquified natural gas (LNG), pressurized by helium gas.

Propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide is being used on current military systems and is in numerous defense and aerospace research and development programs. Many privately funded rocket companies are using hydrogen peroxide, such as Blue Origin and the defunct Armadillo Aerospace; and some amateur groups have expressed interest in manufacturing their own peroxide, both for their use and for sale in small quantities to others. HTP is used on ILR-33 AMBER and Nucleus suborbital rockets.

HTP was planned for use in an attempt to break the land speed record with the Bloodhound SSC car, aiming to reach over . HTP would have been the oxidiser for the hybrid fuel rocket, reacting with the solid fuel hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. The project stalled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lack of funding.

==Availability==
The available suppliers of high-concentration propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide are, in general, one of the large commercial companies that make other grades of hydrogen peroxide, including Solvay Interox, PeroxyChem (formerly FMC Global Peroxygens, a division of FMC Corporation), and Evonik. X-L Space Systems upgrades technical-grade hydrogen peroxide to HTP. Other companies that have made propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide in the recent past include Air Liquide and DuPont. DuPont recently sold its hydrogen peroxide manufacturing business to Evonik. High concentration HTP is offered by the Łukasiewicz Research Network - Institute of Aviation, with concentrations up to 99.99%, and Jakusz SpaceTech, with concentrations of 85-98%.

WEPA-Technologies can deliver both HTP itself as well as fully automatic plants capable to produce on a 24/7 basis HTP within a concentration range between 90 – 99,5 %. The plants are using a containerized setup methodology and can be erected worldwide (capacity: 25 – 1500 kg / day).

Propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide is available to qualified buyers. In typical circumstances, this chemical is sold only to companies or government institutions that have the ability to properly handle and utilize the material. Non-professionals have purchased hydrogen peroxide of 70% or lower concentration (the remaining 30% is water with traces of impurities and stabilizing materials, such as tin salts, phosphates, nitrates, and other chemical additives), and increased its concentration themselves. Distillation is extremely dangerous with hydrogen peroxide; peroxide vapor can not ignite but the released oxygen can ignite any material that it is in contact with, detonation is possible depending on specific combinations of temperature and pressure, the detonation is the result of rapid reactive evaporation of the liquid resulting in high temperature and pressure resulting in a violent rupture of the containing vessel. In general, any boiling mass of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide at ambient pressure will produce vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, which can detonate. This hazard is mitigated, but not eliminated, with vacuum distillation. Other approaches for concentrating hydrogen peroxide are sparging and fractional crystallization.

Hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of at least 35% appear on the US Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Chemicals of Interest list.

==Safety==

Since many common substances catalyze peroxide&#x27;s exothermic decomposition into steam and oxygen, handling of HTP requires special care and equipment. It is noted that the common materials iron and copper are incompatible with peroxide, but the reaction can be delayed for seconds or minutes, depending on the grade of peroxide used.

Small hydrogen peroxide spills are easily dealt with by flooding the area with water. Not only does this cool any reacting peroxide but it also dilutes it thoroughly. Therefore, sites that handle hydrogen peroxide are often equipped with emergency showers, and have hoses and people on safety duty.

Contact with skin causes immediate whitening due to the production of oxygen below the skin. Extensive burns occur unless washed off in seconds. Contact with eyes can cause blindness, and so eye protection is usually used.

The &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine disaster involved the accidental release of HTP in a torpedo which reacted with the torpedo&#x27;s fuel.

<text>A meander or meandros () is a decorative border constructed from a continuous line, shaped into a repeated motif. Among some Italians, these patterns are known as &quot;Greek Lines&quot;. Such a design may also be called the Greek fret or [[Key pattern|Greek key]] design, although these terms are modern designations; this decorative motif appears much earlier and among Near and Far eastern cultures that are far from Greece. Usually the term is used for motifs with straight lines and right angles and the many versions with rounded shapes are called running scrolls or, following the etymological origin of the term, may be identified as water wave motifs.
== Meaning of the name ==
On one hand, the name &quot;meander&quot; recalls the twisting and turning path of the Maeander River in Asia Minor (present day Turkey) that is typical of river pathways. On another hand, as Karl Kerenyi pointed out, &quot;the meander is the figure of a labyrinth in linear form&quot;.
== Decorative uses ==
Meanders are common decorative elements in Greek and Roman art. In ancient Greece they appear in many architectural friezes, and in bands on the pottery of ancient Greece from the Geometric period onward. The design is common to the present-day in classicizing architecture, and is adopted frequently as a decorative motif for borders for many modern printed materials.
== Labyrinthine meanders in China==
The meander is a fundamental design motif in regions far from a Hellenic orbit: labyrinthine meanders (&quot;thunder&quot; pattern ) appear in bands and as infill on Shang bronzes (), and many traditional buildings in and around China still bear geometric designs almost identical to meanders. Although space-filling curves have a long history in China in motifs more than 2,000 years earlier, extending back to Zhukaigou Culture () and Xiajiadian Culture ( and ), frequently there is speculation that meanders of Greek origin may have come to China during the time of the Han dynasty () by way of trade with the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. A meander motif also appears in prehistoric Mayan design motifs in the western hemisphere, centuries before any European contacts.
