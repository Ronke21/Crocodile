<text>Miss Teen USA is a beauty pageant that has been run since 1983 by the Miss Universe Organization for girls aged 14–19 years old as of January 1st of the competition year. They must be US citizens, and cannot have been married, pregnant, or have children. Unlike its sister pageants Miss Universe, which currently broadcasts on JKN18 and like its sister pageant Miss USA, it is televised on The CW television network starting in 2024, after being streamed online for several years. The Miss Universe Organization previously operated Miss Teen USA, as well as Miss USA, until 2020 when the rights to produce both pageants were licensed to Miss USA 2008 Crystle Stewart prior to her suspension in October 2022, thus returning the said pageants to the Miss Universe Organization. The parent company of all three pageants and the Miss Universe organization remains the same under the licensing agreement: JKN Metaverse Inc., a subsidiary of JKN Global Group.

Prior to 1983, a beauty contest bestowing the title of Miss Teen USA was first held in 1959 as a mail-in photo contest by &quot;Teen&quot; magazine.

It next became an annual live stage event through the 1960s and in 1983, the pageant began being produced annually as part of the Miss Universe family of pageants. It was broadcast live on CBS until 2002 and then on NBC from 2003 to 2007. In March 2007, it was announced that the broadcast of the Miss Teen USA pageant on NBC had not been renewed, and that Miss Teen USA 2007 would be the final televised event.

From 2008 to 2015, the pageant was held at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort, located in Nassau, Bahamas. Since 2016, the pageant has been held in the United States once more, and since 2018, it is held concurrently with its sister Miss USA pageant in a single city a few days before the start of Miss USA final competition.

Notable pageant winners include actresses Kelly Hu (1985, Hawaii), Bridgette Wilson (1990, Oregon), Charlotte Lopez-Ayanna (1993, Vermont), Vanessa Minnillo (1998, South Carolina) and Shelley Hennig (2004, Louisiana).

The current Miss Teen USA is Addie Carver of Mississippi, who was crowned on August 1, 2024 at the Peacock Theater, Los Angeles, California. 

==History==

===1959 to 1982===

====1959====

Prior to becoming part of the Miss Universe pageant system in 1983 and current ownership by IMG, the title of &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; was bestowed upon the winner of an annual competition in the United States from 1959 onward, with Peggy Collins, 17, of Lake Charles, Louisiana winning the honor that first year in a contest created by &quot;Teen&quot; magazine. Celebrity judges for the mail-in photo competition included Paul Newman, Robert Wagner, Shirley MacLaine, Janet Leigh, producer Jerry Wald, and fashion designer Edith Head.

====1962 to 1968====

The pageant continued from 1962 to 1968 in which they made debut as annual live stage event.

The 1962 &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; was named at the &quot;Teen-Age Fair&quot;, a ten-day event, over the Easter holiday, in April, held at the Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California, which had 32 teenaged girls from across the United States participating and Linda Henning, a 15-year-old from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was named Miss Teen USA for 1962. She was crowned by television comedian Soupy Sales.

Ohio teenager Judy Adams, 16, was Miss Teen USA for 1963. The four-day event was held at the &quot;Teen-Age Fair&quot; on the grounds of the 15-acre &quot;Pickwick Recreation Center&quot; in Burbank, California, with girls age 14 to 18 representing all 50 states competing. &quot;Pickwick Recreation Center&quot; was &quot;Gay&#x27;s Pickwick Swim Park&quot; and is now called &quot;Pickwick Gardens&quot;.

The winner of Miss Teen USA 1964 was Nancy Spry of Van Nuys, California. Bob Eubanks hosted the televised 1964 pageant, with actor Sebastian Cabot one of the guests.

Singer Bobby Darin crowned 1965&#x27;s Miss Teen USA in April, at the Hollywood Palladium, who was Susan Henning, an 18-year-old student attending Long Beach, California State College.

Miss Teen USA in 1966 was Cindy Lewis. The 1967 pageant was hosted by Sam Riddle and held at the Hollywood Palladium in March.

The pageant in 1968 was held on Saturday, April 13, 1968, in Hollywood and was won by Pamela Martin, 18, from Birmingham, Michigan.

In 1969, local &quot;Miss Teen&quot; winners in the western United States; for example, &quot;Miss Teen Burbank,&quot; &quot;Miss Teen Sherman Oaks,&quot; &quot;Miss Teen Van Nuys,&quot; et al., competed in a regional competition for the title of &quot;Miss Teen Western United States,&quot; with the winner earning a spot at the Miss Teen USA pageant, which was held on April 3, 1969, again at the Hollywood Palladium.

Before the Miss Teen USA pageant became part of the Miss Universe system in 1983, titleholders of &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; in the 1960s either competed as contestants or made appearances at the annual Miss Teen International pageant in Hollywood.

====1970 to 1979====

The history of the Miss Teen USA pageant during the 1970s is less clear. The pageant in the late 1970s was moved to November and as a result the winner was crowned Miss Teen USA for the upcoming year rather than the year that had just past and in which the pageant was held.

In 1978, the pageant to select the 1979 titleholder was held in late November in Miami, Florida during the Thanksgiving holiday week.

In August 1979, the Associated Press wire service ran a multi-part newspaper series over three consecutive days on beauty pageants, which included Miss Teen USA. The series stated that a company called &quot;Miss Teen USA Corp&quot; was formed in 1979, which oversaw the national pageant and in-house and franchised state-level Miss Teen USA pageants. The Miss Teen USA pageant was registered in 1979 to operate under its trade name in the states of New Jersey and Virginia, according to the Burlington County, New Jersey Consumer Affairs Office, which had received inquiries from the public about the legitimacy of it and two other pageants, Miss U.S. Teen-age and Miss National Teen-age, the latter which was not registered but had held a pageant recently.

Included among the many state-level Miss Teen USA pageants in 1979 were Alaska, Hawaii, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia. The winner in 1979 of the national Miss Teen USA title received a $15,000 scholarship, while state titleholders received a $500 scholarship.

====1980 to 1982====

Miss Teen USA for 1980 was Susan McDannold, 19, of St. Albans, West Virginia, who was crowned on December 1, 1979.

Miss Teen USA for 1981 was Tammy Jo Hopkins, 17, of Omaha, Nebraska, who was crowned on November 22, 1980, and who entered as 1980 Miss Nebraska Teen. The Miss Teen USA pageant in late November 1980, in which Hopkins won the 1981 title, was held in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Tammy Jo Hopkins did not have a full year&#x27;s reign as 1981 Miss Teen USA. She relinquished her crown and title to 1980 Miss Teen USA winner Susan McDannold after accepting a print modeling and TV commercial acting representation contract with a top model agency in New York City (as Tammy Hopkins). McDannold then completed the remainder of the title year as Miss Teen USA for 1981. Susan McDannold is the only Miss Teen USA to ever hold the title twice.

Hugrun Ragnarsson, 18, was crowned 1982 Miss Teen USA in late November 1981. After this pageant, the Miss Universe Organization decided to award the title for the year in which the pageant was held, so the next pageant, held during the summer of 1983 on August 30, was crowned the 1983 Miss Teen USA winner.

Miss Universe, Inc. filed a lawsuit on July 18, 1979, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, against the company running the late-1970s version of the pageant, Miss Teen U.S.A., Inc., for trademark infringement over a claimed similarity with its own &quot;Miss U.S.A.&quot; pageant title and some of its related registered trademarks. The lawsuit, &quot;Miss Universe, Inc. v. Miss Teen U.S.A., Inc.&quot;, resulted initially in an injunction being issued on March 25, 1980, ordering Miss Teen U.S.A., Inc. to cease holding future pageants with the name &quot;Miss Teen U.S.A.&quot; so as not to confuse people with the &quot;Miss U.S.A.&quot; pageant. The injunction was appealed but eventually upheld. The court ruling did not invalidate any past Miss Teen USA titleholders. Miss Universe, Inc. itself did not receive a U.S. trademark registration for &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; until the next decade, in 1991 (see next section). The final winner of the Miss Teen USA title before the Miss Universe Organization began its own version of the pageant was the 1982 Miss Teen USA title won by Hugrun Ragnarsson.

===1983 to present===

A revised Miss Teen USA pageant, once again designed for television, was added to the Miss Universe system of pageants in 1983 by Miss Universe, Inc. which at the time was run by Harold Glasser, and was first broadcast live under that corporate ownership on the CBS television network on August 30, 1983.

Miss Universe, Inc., a California Corporation, filed a U.S. Trademark application for the service marks &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; and &quot;Miss Teen — U.S.A.&quot; on November 14, 1983, and, after eight years of proceedings and challenges by other pageants, was finally approved and registered on October 8, 1991.

In 2015, the then owners of record, Miss Universe L.P., assigned all trademark rights to the names &quot;Miss Teen USA,&quot; &quot;Miss USA,&quot; &quot;Miss Universe,&quot; and others, to IMG Universe, LLC. The company IMG Universe, LLC, a subsidiary of IMG, manages the latter&#x27;s pageant-related intellectual property and licensing agreements. IMG&#x27;s parent company is Endeavor. The parent company of the Miss Universe Organization is also Endeavor.

In the summer of 2020, the Miss Universe organization and IMG Universe, LLC licensed future annual operation of the Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants to Crystle Stewart, who was Miss USA 2008, until her suspension in October 2022. The first competitions of the licensed pageants under her directorship are the 2021 productions.

In October 2022, IMG assigned all trademark rights to the names &quot;Miss Teen USA,&quot; &quot;Miss USA,&quot; &quot;Miss Universe,&quot; and others, to JKN Metaverse Inc., a subsidiary of JKN Global Group.

In August 2023, it was announced that Crystle Stewart had stepped down as president of the Miss USA Organization. She was replaced by fashion designer Laylah Rose.

In May 8, 2024, UmaSofia Srivastava, then Miss Teen USA 2023, resigned from her title amid allegations of ill-treatment, abuse, and bullying within the Miss USA organization. The revelations came to light when Srivastava&#x27;s mother, Barbara, addressed the issue on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, suggesting her daughter&#x27;s dream job had turned into a nightmare.

==Pageant editions==

The following is a list of Miss Teen USA pageant editions and information during the era when it was run by or associated with the Miss Universe Organization, including to the present day.

==Competition rounds==

Prior to the final telecast the delegates compete in the preliminary competition, which involves private interviews with the judges and a presentation show where they compete in swimsuit and evening gown.

During the final competition, the semi-finalists are announced and go on to compete in swimsuit and evening gown. From 1983 to 2002 all semi-finalists also competed in an interview competition as well as both swimsuit and evening gown, followed by one or two final interview questions. In 2003, a new format was introduced where the top fifteen competed in evening gown, the top ten competed in swimsuit and the top five competed in the final question. In 2006, the order of competition was changed where the top fifteen competed in swimsuit and the top ten in evening gown. The latest competition format was used since 2008 the final not broadcast on TV, where the top fifteen both competed in swimsuit and evening gown, and the top five competed in the final question who all signed up by a panel of judges.

Former Miss Teen USA Katherine Haik supported calls to eliminate the swimsuit competition. The swimsuit category was chastised for exploiting and sexualizing young women and not promoting diverse body types. The new activewear portion would increase the focus on wellness and health of young ladies.

==Broadcasting of the pageant==
===1983–2007: Viewership and later decline===
The pageant&#x27;s viewership peak was hit in 1988, when the pageant averaged over 22 million viewers on CBS. Even as recently as 1999, the show managed to bring in over 10 million viewers. The 2006 airing was the second lowest rated in the pageant&#x27;s 23-year history, with only 5.6 million viewers watching the live broadcast (the lowest: 2004, with 5.34 million). The 2007 telecast (25th Anniversary, scheduled for August 24, 2007) was the last time Miss Teen USA aired live on television.

===2008–2023: internet pageant===
The 2008 pageant was held, untelevised, on August 16, 2008. One factor that prevented NBC from broadcasting was its prime time commitment to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Since then, it has been broadcast over the Internet on the Miss Teen USA website. It can be viewed worldwide, without any region restrictions via geolocation. Currently, it is hosted by YouTube (Ustream from 2008 to 2013). In addition, the webcast can be accessed on the pageant&#x27;s Facebook page and on mobile devices using the official Miss Universe mobile app released during Miss USA 2016.

From 2012-2019, the pageant began to simulcast in selected regions on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live service, allowing owners of the Xbox 360 (until 2017) and/or Xbox One consoles to watch the pageant on a television screen. From 2017-2020, the pageant was also broadcast on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Network service.

===2024: Return to television===
In March 2024, it was announced that for the first time since 2007, the pageant would be televised on The CW, alongside Miss USA.

==Crossovers with Miss USA==
===Miss Teen USA at Miss USA===
In the early years of Miss Teen USA, three winners represented the title &quot;Miss Teen USA&quot; at Miss USA. The three queens were: Ruth Zakarian (1983), Cherise Haugen (1984), and Allison Brown (1986). This also made history because the Miss USA 1984 pageant had 53 delegates, the most ever in a Miss USA pageant. In 1987, Miss Teen USA 1986, Allison Brown participated in the 1987 Miss USA pageant. All three failed to make the cut at their respective Miss USA pageants.

Only in the three years mentioned above did Miss Teen USA winners automatically gain representation at Miss USA. Starting in 1988, if the Miss Teen USA winners want to compete at Miss USA, they first must win a Miss USA state crown. A total of seven Miss Teen USA winners have participated at Miss USA, with four winning their state Miss USA crowns first. The first of these was Kelly Hu, Miss Teen USA 1985, who won the Miss Hawaii USA 1993 title and represented Hawaii at Miss USA 1993. She finished as a finalist. The next was Jamie Solinger, Miss Teen USA 1992. She took the Miss Iowa USA 1998 title but failed to make the cut at the Miss USA pageant. Only two Miss Teen USA winners have made the top 3 of Miss USA. Brandi Sherwood, Miss Teen USA 1989 won the Miss Idaho USA 1997 title. Succeeding Kelly, she took 1st runner up and later inherited the Miss USA crown, when Brook Mahealani Lee of Hawaii won Miss Universe 1997. She is the only Miss Teen USA winner to hold the title Miss USA. Shauna Gambill was close in winning the Miss USA 1998 title, but placed 1st runner up to Shawnae Jebbia, Miss Massachusetts USA 1998. However, to date it has never happened that the same woman had won the 2 separate pageants officially.

There have been two years when two Miss Teen USA winners participated at Miss USA. The first was 1984, when Miss Teen USA 1983 and Miss Teen USA 1984 participated, the second was 1998, when Jamie Solinger competed as Miss Iowa USA but went unplaced, and Shauna Gambill competed as Miss California USA and placed first runner-up.

The first Miss Teen USA not to win a Miss USA state pageant on her first attempt was Christie Lee Woods, Miss Teen USA 1996, of Texas, who placed third runner-up in the Miss Texas USA 2002 pageant. She would also become the first Miss Teen USA to compete for, but never win a Miss USA state title (she also placed as a semi-finalist in 2003 and 2004). The second Miss Teen USA who did not win a Miss USA state title on her first attempt was Ashley Coleman, Miss Teen USA 1999, of Delaware, who competed in the Miss California USA 2006 pageant and finished third runner-up. She is the first Miss Teen USA winner to compete in a different state from that where she won her Miss Teen USA crown. Tami Farrell, Miss Teen USA 2003, competed at Miss California USA 2009 as Miss Malibu USA, but failed to win the crown, placing first runner-up to Carrie Prejean. Farrell competed at Miss Teen USA as Miss Oregon Teen USA, and was one of the few Miss Teen USA winners to try for the state crown outside of the state she represented for Miss Teen USA. In a span of only two years later, Miss Teen USA 2006, Katie Blair also competed at Miss California USA 2011. Representing the state of Montana at Miss Teen USA 2006, Blair is only the third Miss Teen USA to compete in a state other than the state she competed in Teen. Similarly to Coleman and Farrell, Blair placed 1st runner up in the pageant, to Alyssa Campanella, who also competed in Miss Teen USA representing New Jersey. Campanella went on to win Miss USA 2011. Danielle Doty, Miss Teen USA 2011, competed at Miss Texas USA 2018, who placed in the semifinals.

<doc id="974312" wikidata="Q715774" url="?curid=974312" title="Ssireum">
<text>Ssireum (; ) or Korean wrestling is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea that began in the fourth century.

In the modern form each contestant wears a belt (satba) that wraps around the waist and the thigh. The competition employs a series of techniques, which inflict little harm or injury to the opponent: opponents lock on to each other&#x27;s belt, and one achieves victory by bringing any part of the opponent&#x27;s body above the knee to the ground.

== Etymology ==
There have been other terms for &quot;wrestling&quot; in Korean used alongside &quot;ssireum&quot;, such as &quot;gakjeo&quot; (각저:角抵), &quot;gakhui&quot; (각희:角戱), &quot;gakryeok&quot; (각력:角力), &quot;gakji&quot; (각지:角支), &quot;chiuhui&quot; (치우희:蚩尤戱), &quot;sangbak&quot; (상박:相撲), &quot;jaenggyo&quot; (쟁교:爭交). 
&quot;Gak&quot; (각:角), a commonly used prefix, seems to have originated from the combative act performed by horned animals such as oxen when competing against one another for the superiority of physical strength.

==Mechanics==
&quot;Ssireum&quot; wrestlers seek to turn the opponent&#x27;s torso from about 45 degrees to 90 degrees when throwing. This is mostly done by shifting the opponent&#x27;s weight onto their leg then pushing back their weight toward the floor.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of &quot;ssireum&quot; dates back to the Goguryeo period (37 BC – 668 AD). Originally used in military applications, &quot;ssireum&quot; became a popular pastime of the people, including royal militaries, during the Goryeo and Joseon periods.

In traditional life, &quot;ssireum&quot; was a popular activity on the Korean holiday of Dano, the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, and tournaments are held in the summer and autumn. &quot;Ssireum&quot; competitions were also held on other days such as the Third Day of the Third Moon, the Eighth day of the Fourth Moon and Buddhist All Souls&#x27; Day.. The traditional prize at a tournament was an ox, a valuable commodity in an agriculturally based society and symbolizing the strength of the contestant.

In the 20th century, &quot;ssireum&quot; became a nationally televised sport in South Korea.
The first modern competition was held in October 1912 at Dansungsa theater in Seoul.

Korean wrestling has been referred to as &quot;ssireum&quot; since the 1920s. The Pan Chosun Ssireum Association was founded in 1927 and held the annual nationwide contest until 1937. The First Pan Chosun Ssireum Championship was organized in 1936 and thereafter professional competitions were held for six consecutive years. In 1946, the Pan Chosun Ssireum Association changed its name to &quot;Daehan (Korea) Ssireum Association&quot;. Weight classes were introduced in 1956 at the 12th National Ssireum Championship. 
The Korea Ssireum Association holds the National Ssireum Championship every year as well as the President&#x27;s Cup National Ssireum Competition&quot; (since 1964), Professional Sports Competition, Folk Ssireum Competition, and Amateur Sports Competition.

There are two traditional styles of &quot;ssireum&quot;: a &quot;right-sided&quot; style predominant in parts of Gyeonggi Province and the Honam region of southern Korea and a &quot;left-side&quot; style favored in the Gyeongsang and Chuncheong provinces. The difference depends on the way the &quot;satba&quot; is fastened. In 1994, the Korean Ssireum Federation proposed the unification of &quot;ssireum&quot; into a single left-sided style as the official style to be used by all competitors.

===Cultural heritage status ===
Following an unprecedented joint application by both South and North Korea, &quot;ssireum&quot; was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. It is also enlisted as the 131st Intangible Cultural Property.

== Method of competition ==

&quot;Ssireum&quot; is conducted within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which is covered with mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (&quot;baro japki&quot;), each grabbing a belt—known as a &quot;satba&quot; ()—which is wrapped around his opponent&#x27;s waist and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other&#x27;s &#x27;satba.&#x27; The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher. Unlike sumo, pushing an opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional &quot;ssireum&quot; is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.

There are three judges, a chief referee and three sub referees. The chief judge is positioned inside the ring, whereas the sub referees are located on the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a revocation of the decision or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees&#x27; decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.

Today there are also women &quot;ssireum&quot; wrestlers. Women wrestle only among themselves but follow the same rules (except that men are topless whereas women wear tops).

There are four weight classes in professional wrestling: flyweight (Taebaek, 75 kg), lightweight (Geumgang, 90 kg), middleweight (Halla, 105 kg), and heavyweight (Baekdu, under 160 kg), named after the four famous peaks in Korea.

Traditionally &quot;ssireum&quot; was contested with the top portion of the trousers rolled down to provide grip. The use of &quot;satba&quot; was invented with the birth of professional &quot;ssireum&quot; in the mid-20th century. There is a movement to restore this traditional method of grip, in the spirit of maintaining its cultural and traditional roots, but it has met with some resistance as the use of &quot;satba&quot; has become entrenched in the modern form.

The professional league is dwindling in popularity and many wrestlers have turned their attention to mixed martial arts fighting, even though &quot;ssireum&quot; involves no striking or submissions of any kind, as a means of making a living. Choi Hong-man, former champion of &quot;ssireum&quot;, enjoyed notable success in the K-1 scene. Unfortunately, the future of professional &quot;ssireum&quot; remains bleak, with only one team remaining. However, it can also be argued that &quot;ssireum&quot; is beginning to undergo global expansion as a popular martial arts sport, alongside taekwondo and hapkido.

It is important to note the differences between &quot;ssireum&quot; and sumo. &quot;Ssireum&quot; has remained largely a national/traditional sport. Physical hits such as slaps and blows are not permitted in &quot;ssireum&quot;, though they are in sumo. In both sports, the competitors are often quite large, though Korean wrestlers tend to be leaner. However, size does not guarantee success in either sport. Although both sports are quite similar, they differ in characteristics as well as values.

The national governing body of the sport in Korea, Korean Ssireum Organization, has made a claim that &quot;ssireum&quot; is characterized as a &quot;peaceful competition focusing on harmony and unison&quot;, reflecting the &quot;philosophical outlook of the Korean Race&quot;.

== Events ==
=== World Championships ===
The first World Ssireum Championships were held in September 2008 during the Busan World TreX-Games, but these were unofficial competitions. The official first championships were held in Siauliai, Lithuania, and a total of 120 wrestlers from 40 countries participated in the two-day event, according to the World Ssireum Federation (WSF). The first Asia Ssireum Championship and fifth World Ssireum Championship took place simultaneously at Thuwana National Indoor Stadium in Yangon, Myanmar, from September 18 to 23 of 2015.

=== Korean Championship (unlimited) ===
The Korean Ssireum Championships have unlimited weight classes in addition to four weight classes. The champions of this class are called the &quot;Cheonhajangsa&quot;. (; meaning the strongest man under the sky)

<text>The Rialto Bridge (; ) is the oldest of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. Connecting the &quot;&quot; (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first construction as a pontoon bridge in 1173, and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city.

The present stone bridge is a single span designed by Antonio da Ponte. Construction began in 1588 and was completed in 1591. It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops. The engineering of the bridge was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. The bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons, and top tourist attractions, in Venice.

== History ==

The first dry crossing of the Grand Canal was a pontoon bridge built in 1181 by Nicolò Barattieri. It was called the Ponte della Moneta, presumably because of the mint that stood near its eastern entrance.

The development and importance of the Rialto market on the eastern bank increased traffic on the floating bridge, so it was replaced in 1255 by a wooden bridge. This structure had two ramps meeting at a movable central section, that could be raised to allow the passage of tall ships. The connection with the market eventually led to a change of name for the bridge. During the first half of the 15th century, two rows of shops were built along the sides of the bridge. The rents brought an income to the State Treasury, which helped maintain the bridge.

Maintenance was vital for the timber bridge. It was partly burnt in the revolt led by Bajamonte Tiepolo in 1310. In 1444, it collapsed under the weight of a crowd rushing to see the marriage of the Marquis of Ferrara and it collapsed again in 1524.
The idea of rebuilding the bridge in stone was first proposed in 1503. Several projects were considered over the following decades. In 1551, the authorities requested proposals for the renewal of the Rialto Bridge, among other things. Plans were offered by famous architects, such as Jacopo Sansovino, Palladio and Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation. Michelangelo also was considered as designer of the bridge.

== Other names ==
It was called &quot;Shylock&#x27;s bridge&quot; in Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;A Toccata of Galuppi&#x27;s&quot;.

<doc id="974325" wikidata="Q525633" url="?curid=974325" title="Booth Island">
<text>Booth Island (or Wandel Island; ) is a Y-shaped island, long and rising to in the northeast part of the Wilhelm Archipelago, Antarctica.
==Location==

Booth Island is off the east end of the Graham Coast on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula.
It is in the Wilhelm Archipelago, to the northeast of the Vedel Islands and southwest of the Wauwermans Islands.
It is separated from the mainland by the Lemaire Channel, to the southeast. It is east of Cape Renard at the entrance to Flandres Bay.

Booth Island is partly covered by an ice cap of varying thickness. The ice is at most about thick.

==Sailing directions==
The US Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1976) describes Booth Island as follows:
==Discovery and name==
Booth Island was discovered and named by a German expedition under Eduard Dallmann in 1873-74, probably for Oskar Booth or Stanley Booth, or both, members of the Hamburg Geographical Society at that time. 
The United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) has rejected the name Wandel Island, applied by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition (BelgAE), 1897-99, in favor of the original naming.

The sea slug species &quot;Curnon granulosa&quot; was first described in 1906 from a single specimen found at 40 m depth at Booth Island.

== Northern features ==

Features of the northeast peninsula of the island, the Mount Lacroix peninsula, include:

===Turquet Point===
A point marking the north extremity of Booth Island. 
Probably first seen by the German expedition 1873-74, under Dallmann. 
The point was charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot and named by him for J. Turquet, naturalist of the expedition.

===Brouardel Point===
A point north of Port Charcot along the west side of the Mount Lacroix peninsula, Booth Island. 
First charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, and named for Doctor Brouardel, identified by Jean-Baptiste Charcot as a member of the Institut de France.

===Cléry Peak===
A peak, high, on the north side of Mount Lacroix, a conspicuous massif at the north end of Booth Island.
Charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Charcot, who named it for his father-in-law L. Cléry, an eminent French lawyer.

===Mount Lacroix===
A prominent mountain with red vertical cliffs and a rounded summit, high, surmounting the northeast end of Booth Island. 
First charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot and named by him after Alfred Lacroix (1863-1948) French mineralogist and geologist; member of the scientific commission for FrAe, 1903-05 and 1908-10.

==Central features== 
Features of the main body of the island include: 

===Salpêtrière Bay===
A bay wide, between Hervéou Point and Poste Point along the west side of Booth Island. 
First charted by the FrAE under Doctor Jean-Baptiste Charcot, 1903-05, and named by him after the Hopital de la Salpetriere, a Paris hospital where his father, Doctor Jean Martin Charcot, founded a clinic for the treatment of nervous diseases.

===Jeanne Hill===

Discovered by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Doctor Jean-Baptiste Charcot, and named by him for his sister.

===Mount Guéguen===
A sharp rocky peak, high, standing northwest of Louise Peak in the north part of Booth Island, in the Wilhelm Archipelago. 
Discovered by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who named it for F. Guéguen, stoker on the Français, and later the Pourquoi Pas?.

===Louise Peak===
Peak, high, standing north of Gourdon Peak on Booth Island. 
First charted by the FrAE under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, 1903-05, and named by him for the sister of Ernest Gourdon, geologist of the expedition.

A peak north of Wandel Peak, one of several high peaks on the N-S trending ridge of Booth Island.
First charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, and named by him for Ernest Gourdon, geologist of the expedition.

===Wandel Peak===
A peak, high, standing south of Gourdon Peak and marking the highest point on Booth Island. 
In 1898, the BelgAE under Gerlache charted this area and applied the name &quot;Ile Wandel&quot; to this island which Dallmann had named Booth in 1873-74. 
Although Booth later became established as the name of the island, Gerlache&#x27;s naming has been preserved in the name for its highest peak. 
Carl F. Wandel (1843-1930) was a Danish hydrographer who assisted in preparations for the Belgian expedition.

In 2003, Australian mountaineer Damien Gildea called it &quot;one of the most challenging unclimbed objectives on the Antarctic Peninsula&quot;.
On 15 February 2006 the peak was reached by a group of Spanish alpinists, who still avoided the last of the mushroomlike top.

===Poste Point===
A point on the west side of Booth Island which marks the south limit of Salpêtrière Bay. 
First charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, and named by Jean-Baptiste Charcot for L. Poste, stoker on the ship Français.

===Roullin Point===
A point marking the south tip of Booth Island. 
Probably first seen by the German expedition under Dallmann, 1873-74.

===Paumelle Point===
A point marking the south side of the entrance to Libois Bay and the northwest end of the peninsula which forms the west extremity of Booth Island. 
First charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, and named by Jean-Baptiste Charcot for R. Paumelle, steward of the ship Français.

===Libois Bay===
Cove on the west side of Cholet Island which is entered between Rozo Point, the northwest end of Cholet Island, and Paumelle Point, the northwest end of Booth Island.

Charcot established the expedition&#x27;s winter base at Port Charcot in 1904.

A cairn at Port Charcot, with a wooden pillar and a plaque inscribed with the names of the members of the French expedition, has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 28), following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

==Nearby features==
Nearby features, from north to south, include:
===Detour Island===
An island lying west of False Cape Renard, on the west side of Lemaire Channel in the Wilhelm Archipelago. 
First charted by the FrAE under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, 1903-05. 
So named by the UK-APC in 1959 because the island lies near the entrance to the ships&#x27; passage west of Booth Island which provides an alternative route to Lemaire Channel when the latter is blocked by ice.

===Splitwind Island===
An island long, lying off the north end of Booth Island, in the Wilhelm Archipelago. 
Charted by the FrAE, 1903-05, and named by Jean-Baptiste Charcot for Alphonse de Rothschild. 
To avoid confusion with Rothschild Island near Alexander Island, the UK-APC in 1959 recommended that the name be changed to Splitwind Island.
Owing to some physical peculiarity, the wind south of this island is often very different from that north of it.

===Mumm Islands===

A group of islands and rocks lying between the Wauwermans Islands and Vedel Islands in the Wilhelm Archipelago. 
The Wilhelm Archipelago was first sighted and named by a German expedition under Dallmann, 1873-74. 
It was resighted and named Dannebrog Islands by the BelgAE, 1897-99, under Gerlache, in appreciation of support given to Gerlache by Denmark. 
Dallmann&#x27;s original naming has been retained for the archipelago, and the name Dannebrog restricted to the smaller group here described.

===Rollet Island===
A small island north of the northwest part of Booth Island in the Dannebrog Islands. 
Discovered by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who named it &quot;Ile Rollet de l&#x27;Isle&quot; for Monsieur Rollet de I&#x27;lsle, French hydrographic surveyor. 
A shortened form of the original name has been adopted.

===Sögen Island===
An island forming the east side of Français Cove, lying in the southwest extremity of Port Charcot, which indents the north part of Booth Island. 
Discovered by the FrAE, 1903-05, under Charcot, and named for one of the dogs which died and was buried here. 
The name has been approved because of its long use.

===Cholet Island===
A small island immediately north of the narrow peninsula which forms the west extremity of Booth Island.

<doc id="974326" wikidata="Q13452796" url="?curid=974326" title="Kinney National Company">
<text>Kinney Services Inc. was an American conglomerate company from 1966 to 1972. Its successor was Warner Communications. Kinney National&#x27;s predecessors were Kinney Service Corporation and National Cleaning Contractors Inc., whose merger began in January 1966 and was completed in August of the same year. National Cleaning Contractors was founded in 1886 by Louis Frankel and Max Sweig as National Window Cleaning &amp; House Renovating Co., and was later known as National House Cleaning Contractors Inc.

== History ==
=== Formation and expansion ===
The company was formed on August 12, 1966, as Kinney National Services Inc., when the Kinney Parking Company and the National Cleaning Contractors Inc. were merged. The new company was headed by Steve Ross.

Kinney National Services (later, National was removed from the company name in February 1971) was known for purchases and sales:

* On July 21, 1967, Kinney National expanded by acquiring National Periodical Publications (more commonly, but not yet officially, called DC Comics, which would occur in 1977) which owned the &quot;Mad&quot; magazine of E. C. Publications, Inc. The acquisition was completed on August 25 of the same year.
* On November 13, 1967, Kinney bought Hollywood talent agency Ashley-Famous. Ted Ashley (the founder of Ashley-Famous) suggested to Ross that he buy out the cash-strapped film company Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which had purchased Atlantic Records that same month.
* In February 1968, Kinney acquired Panavision, Inc. 
* On October 8 of the same year, Kinney National sold its subsidiary Kinney System Rent-A-Car to Sandgate Corporation for about $11 million in cash and notes.
* On January 28, 1969, it was announced that Kinney National would acquire Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. The acquisition was completed on July 4. On April 20, Ashley-Famous was sold because of antitrust laws prohibiting a company from owning both a production studio and a talent agency. In August, Ted Ashley became chief of the film company. On December 16, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Inc. was rebranded as Warner Bros. Inc. Beginning with the unexpected success of the concert documentary &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970), Warner Bros. started scoring box office hits again and became a major studio. 
* In 1970, Kinney National bought Jac Holzman&#x27;s Elektra Records and Nonesuch Records.

On June 10, 1971, Kinney sold Riverside Memorial Chapel to Service Corporation International. Kinney also announced that it would form a new separate company focused on its parking and cleaning businesses; National Kinney Corporation was formally founded in September 1971.

On November 22, 1971, Kinney Services also bought Television Communications Corporation (which was renamed as Warner Cable in 1973), including its recording studio operations of 1,210,500 common shares.

Kinney National also owned wood flooring manufacturer Circle Floor from Seymour Milstein and Paul Milstein, when Kinney&#x27;s predecessor bought it in 1964 for $15 million, with the Milsteins remaining as managers of the unit until 1971 before the sale.

=== Financial scandal ===
Due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets on August 7, 1971 as the National Kinney Corporation, and renamed the remaining Kinney Services as Warner Communications Inc. on February 10, 1972.

Steve Ross was the company&#x27;s sole CEO, president, and chairman. Directors included Charles A. Agemian, the CEO of Garden State National Bank.

<doc id="974329" wikidata="Q119001253" url="?curid=974329" title="Livedoor">
<text>was a Japanese company that functioned as an Internet service provider and operator of a web portal and blog platform before being brought down by a scandal in 2006. The company was founded and led in its first 10 years by Takafumi Horie, known as &quot;Horiemon&quot; in Japan. Livedoor grew into one of Japan&#x27;s premier Internet businesses, putting over 1,000 employees on its payroll at its peak. Its reliance on acquisitions and stock swap mergers to achieve growth also made it one of the country&#x27;s most controversial enterprises. Its growth came to a resounding halt when scandal erupted in early 2006. An investigation of securities law violations led to a nosedive in the company&#x27;s stock price. The Tokyo Stock Exchange delisted Livedoor on April 14, 2006. The floundering company&#x27;s properties were purchased by South Koreabased NHN Corporation in 2010.

The ISP and blog services that bear the Livedoor name used to be operated by Line Corporation, developers of Line messaging services and the Naver Japan search portal from 2012 - 2022. Line Corporation, based in Japan, was spun off from NHN Japan, an arm of its Korean parent, in February 2013.

In 2022, Livedoor was sold to . In February of the same year, its founder Takafumi Horie became executive advisor to livedoor.

==History==

===Origins and growth===
Livedoor began in 1995 as Livin&#x27; on the Edge, a startup company run by Horie and a group of college friends and was officially founded as Livin&#x27; On the EDGE Inc. in April 1996, in Minato, Tokyo. In 1997, it was renamed Livin&#x27; On the EDGE Co., Ltd. Though initially a limited company (yugen kaisha), Livin&#x27; On the Edge was reorganized into a joint-stock company (&quot;kabushiki kaisha&quot;) in July 1997 and within only 3 years, went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s Mothers market in April 2000. In November 2002, Livin&#x27; on the Edge acquired the free Internet services business of Livedoor Corp., which had gone bankrupt. Livin&#x27; On the Edge changed its name to Edge Co., Ltd. in April 2003, then adopted the name of the ISP business it had acquired from Livedoor Corp., by renaming itself livedoor Co. Ltd. (Livedoor), in February 2004. This was followed by a 1:100 stock split. 

In March 2004, during the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment, Livedoor moved to acquire the Kintetsu Buffaloes, a Japanese baseball team, but later withdrew its offer and, in September 2004, founded its own team (named &quot;livedoor baseball&quot;) and applied for admittance to Japan&#x27;s professional baseball organization. The team&#x27;s home ground was to be in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, but livedoor lost the competition to be the city&#x27;s home team to Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company; the team became the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles and began play in 2005.

Livedoor acquisitions in the U.S. included MailCreations in Miami, Florida, in June 2004, which functioned as the company&#x27;s U.S. headquarters. Livedoor entered search and contextual advertising spaces in America in November 2005.

A scandal involving securities law violations led the Tokyo Stock Exchange to delist Livedoor on April 14, 2006.

===Allegations===

The case broke on January 16, 2006, when Tokyo prosecutors raided several Livedoor locations, Horie&#x27;s home, and the homes of other Livedoor and subsidiary executives on suspicions of securities fraud. The raids spooked investors and sent shares plunging on January 17 and 18 as a widening criminal investigation sparked panic selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Some brokers announced they would no longer allow use of the issue for margin trading. Volume was so heavy that it threatened to overload the TSE&#x27;s computer system, prompting a halt in trading for the entire market—a breaking record and the first time this has ever occurred. The TSE ordered Livedoor to provide a formal response to the allegations. When the company filed a hasty report after a quick internal investigation, the TSE told executives to provide a more detailed report and threatened to delist Livedoor if allegations of improper activities proved valid.

On January 18, 2006, Hideaki Noguchi, an executive of H.S. Securities, a firm raided by prosecutors earlier in the week in connection with Livedoor, was found dead in a Naha, Okinawa hotel room in what the authorities labeled a suicide.

The authorities called in several Livedoor and subsidiary executives for questioning over several days, and Horie himself on January 23. After several hours of questioning Horie, investigators felt they had learned enough to press charges and petitioned for four arrest warrants, which were granted. Horie, Livedoor&#x27;s chief financial officer, and the presidents of two subsidiaries were arrested mid-evening for securities and accounting fraud. They were held for two months without bail, and during this time, Livedoor&#x27;s temporary Representative Director Fumito Kumagai was also arrested.

Japan&#x27;s Securities Commission filed a criminal complaint against the five arrested ex-executives of the company on March 13, 2006. Founder Horie was sentenced to 2.5 years in jail on March 16, 2007. Others were given various jail sentences four days later but appealed.

===Aftermath===
After losing 90% of its stock price in four months and strong evidence of securities fraud, Livedoor was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 14, 2006.

Fuji Television sued the company for ¥35 billion in damages in March 2007; 1,000 individual investors filed a class-action suit in May 2006, eventually rising to 3,340 asking for ¥23 billion, which resulted in a final ruling of ¥7.6 billion against Livedoor, and other similar suits resulted at least one judgment of ¥4.9 billion. Livedoor in turn sued its own executives, with founder Horie settling for ¥21 billion and six others settling for a total of ¥760 million.

Information obtained during the investigation led to the arrest and conviction of fund manager Yoshiaki Murakami for using inside information to profit off of a stake Livedoor purchased in Nippon Broadcasting System in 2005.

Horie published an autobiography during his appeals, &quot;Complete Resistance&quot;, in which he proclaims his innocence and states that he was being targeted only due to his infamy, not the actual nature or severity of any crimes.

The veracity of the suspicions aside, many smelled conspiracy given the timing of the action. It was seen as a political move by defenders of the status quo to punish Horie for daring to challenge them, and to discredit him and the business practices he had come to represent, which Horie&#x27;s opponents considered distasteful and &quot;un-Japanese.&quot;

In order to prevent a recurrence of the scandal, Japan passed a law similar to Sarbanes–Oxley, nicknamed J-SOX, on June 14, 2006.

===Livedoor Holdings===
In 2007, the company spun off to create a new subsidiary that retained the name of &quot;Livedoor&quot; and most of its portal-related businesses and itself became a pure holding company named &quot;Livedoor Holdings&quot; that oversaw the legal and financial management of its subsidiaries (reportedly 44 subsidiaries as of the end of 2005) including the new Livedoor. In 2008, Livedoor Holdings changed its name to &quot;LDH Corporation.&quot;

===Sale===
During the upheaval in 2006 and 2007 rumors spread that Livedoor was preparing a $2 billion initial public offering in 2008. Several technology companies expressed interest in participating but the IPO never materialized. Livedoor instead put itself up for sale. In early 2010 South Korea-based NHN Corporation bought Livedoor for a reported ¥6.3 billion.

===Liquidation===
After completing the sale of Livedoor and other subsidiaries and paying dividends to its shareholders, LDH Corporation entered into voluntary liquidation by the shareholders&#x27; resolution in August 2011 and completed liquidation in December 2012 after distributing residual assets to its shareholders.

==Offices==
The headquarters of the original Livedoor company were located in the in Nishi-Shinjuku, Shinjuku, Tokyo. Additional corporate offices were located on the 38th floor of the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower at 10-1, Roppongi 6-chome, Minato, Tokyo, 106-6138, Japan.

<text>A bulkhead is a retaining wall, such as a bulkhead within a ship or a watershed retaining wall. It may also be used in mines to contain flooding.

Coastal bulkheads are most often referred to as seawalls, bulkheading, or riprap revetments. These manmade structures are constructed along shorelines with the purpose of controlling beach erosion. Construction materials commonly used include wood pilings, commercially developed vinyl products, large boulders stacked to form a wall, or a seawall built of concrete or another hard substance.

Coastal property owners typically seek to develop bulkheads in an attempt to slow large landslide erosion caused by wave action. Studies over recent decades have resulted in public awareness as to potential negative effects that bulkheads may bring to beaches and the interconnected habitat areas of fish, plants, and birds. Many states have enacted laws to protect beaches to allow for future use of the beaches, as well as protect these natural habitats.

The term bulkhead is also used in a similar but distinct context to refer to large pressure sealing isolation barriers which can be retroactively installed for temporary or permanent use during maintenance or construction activities.

== Effects ==

While bulkheads may serve their purpose to slow erosion at a bluff or beachfront, they commonly cause a domino effect of change to the beach profile. The increased wave reflection caused by their presence can result in an increased re-suspension of sand in the water in front of the bulkhead. This can lead to more sand being distributed in the alongshore direction, away from the beach profile. Due to coastal littoral drift, the sand would then instead be distributed toward the ends of the bulkheads, leaving larger gravel and sometimes bedrock in place of the once sandy beach.

Since sand is a natural habitat for several species of fish to lay their eggs and is also the only surface in which eelgrass can take root, these natural processes can no longer take place in this now sand-stripped location. The absence of eelgrass means that the spawning habitat for herring and the protection for juvenile salmon would no longer be present. This new sand-stripped habitat also encourages other species, such as kelp, to move in.

<text>Euroway was a Swedish ferry company that operated cruise ferries between Sweden and Germany from 1992 till 1994.

==History==
Founded by the Norwegian businessman, Elling Ellingsen, owner of Sea-Link Shipping AB, with the objective to set up cruiseferry connections between the cities of Malmö in Sweden and Lübeck in Germany. Euroway&#x27;s business concept was to provide a cruise ship-style experience.

Euroway planned to open their service in mid-1991, however the first of two large car and passenger ferries ordered from the Brodogradiliste Split shipyard in Croatia, was delayed because of the Yugoslav wars. The first ship, M/S &quot;Frans Suell&quot;, was not delivered until May 1992. The start was troublesome; it was for a long time unclear when scheduled traffic would begin and marketing was poorly executed. On May 19, &quot;Frans Suell&quot; made her first trip from Malmö to Travemünde. On September 1, the route was extended to Lübeck with a one way trip from Malmö to Lübeck via Travemünde taking approximately 15 hours. Due to a request from the city of Lübeck to avoid additional traffic congestion, Euroway had to stop in Travemünde to let boarded cars off. Euroway&#x27;s main target groups were cruise and conference passengers and initially no trucks were carried. 

A sister ship for Frans Suell was initially ordered, but delays at the shipyard and poor profitability made Euroway cancel its order later on. If the ship would have been delivered to Euroway its name would have been M/S &quot;Frans Kockum&quot;. The shipyard continued working on the ship and eventually sold it to the shipping company DFDS. Euroway speculated in chartering the Viking Line ship M/S &quot;Olympia&quot; from Rederi AB Slite, but the deal did not go through.

Due to management problems and the economic situation in Europe, Sea Link AB was by 1993 looking for a partner for Euroway. Silja Line joined Euroway and the company changed its name to &quot;Silja Line Euroway&quot; with Silja&#x27;s &quot;Silja Festival&quot; being added as a second ship. A major factor in the teamup of Silja and Euroway was Swedish Nordbanken, which was a major funder of both Silja and Euroway. In September the Euroway route was extended to Copenhagen - Malmö - Travemünde - Lübeck, and trucks were now allowed on board. On 12 March 1994 the Euroway service was cancelled due to lack of passengers and Silja Line&#x27;s financial problems.

<doc id="974334" wikidata="Q1069384" url="?curid=974334" title="Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes">
<text>The were a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) team based in Osaka, Japan, which was in the Pacific League. In 2005 the team was merged with the Orix BlueWave to become the team now known as the Orix Buffaloes. The team played in Fujiidera Stadium, and later in Osaka Dome.

Although the team won four Pacific League championships, they lost all four Japan Series in which they played. The team&#x27;s batting lineup was known as &quot;Itemae Dasen&quot; (いてまえ打線).

== Logo design ==
A stylized buffalo&#x27;s head with angry-looking red eyes (designed by Okamoto Taro), or &quot;Buffaloes&quot; in red script, outlined with white. Another logo featured the &quot;Buffaloes&quot; in red script, while also featuring Buffie, the Buffaloes mascot.

== Franchise history ==
The team was founded in 1949 and began play in 1950 in the newly organized NPB. Owned by Kinki Nippon Railway Co. (later known as Kintetsu Railway), the franchise was known as the Kintetsu Pearls from 1950 to 1958, Kintetsu Buffalo from 1959 to 1961, the Kintetsu Buffaloes from 1962 to 1998, and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes from 1999 to 2004. In 1961, the Buffaloes lost 103 games that year. As of 2022, it is NPB&#x27;s only 100 loss season.

The Kintetsu Buffalo were among the first Japanese teams to sign American players. They signed former major league pitcher Glenn Mickens and catcher Ron Bottler for the 1959 season. Mickens had played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1953 and Bottler had been a career minor league catcher in the United States. Mickens played for five years in Japan, compiling a record of 45–53 with a 2.54 ERA. Bottler played for the Buffalo for three seasons, gradually converting from catcher to starting pitcher, where he had more success.

It took 30 years for the franchise to win its first Pacific League title, in 1979, but it lost the Japan Series to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 4-games-to-3. The Buffaloes made it back to the Japan Series in 1980, but again lost to Hiroshima by the same margin.

The franchise&#x27;s most notable player was pitcher Keishi Suzuki, who played for the Buffaloes from 1966 to 1985, compiling a won-loss record of 317–238, a 3.11 ERA, and 3,061 strikeouts. He was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002.

In 1988, the Buffaloes were so close to making the Japan Series, after tying a second game in a double-header against the Lotte Orions. In order for Kintetsu to win the pennant, they had to win both games.

They would make the Japan Series the following year, but just barely, after being .001 winning percentage higher than the second place Orix Braves, but lost to the Giants in the first reverse sweep since the 1958 Japan Series.

American outfielder Ralph Bryant starred for the Buffaloes from 1988 to 1995, in the process becoming one of the best left-handed power hitters in Japanese baseball history. Bryant had his best season in , where his 49 home runs led the Buffaloes to their third Pacific League championship. He won the season MVP award that year, and also tied Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s career record for hitting three home runs in a game five times. Bryant also struck out countless times, and holds the top four spots on the single-season strikeout records in Nippon Professional Baseball.

Pitcher Hideo Nomo starred for the Buffaloes from 1990 to 1994 before he exercised a loophole in his contract and &quot;retired,&quot; allowing him to sign with MLB&#x27;s Los Angeles Dodgers. The subsequent wave of players moving to Major League Baseball has become a fixture of Japanese professional baseball. To combat this, MLB and NPB agreed to make the posting system, which allowed players in NPB to &quot;post&quot; and allowed them to move to MLB. Without Nomo, the Buffaloes struggled in pitching, with a 4.16 ERA and 4.70 FIP after Nomo&#x27;s departure.

In 2000, the Buffaloes signed Mexican pitcher Narciso Elvira. While he had terrible pitching, he was noted for being the only Mexican player in NPB history as of 2022 to throw a no-hitter, and only allowing 4 walks. He was cut 6 games into the Buffaloes&#x27; 2001 Pacific League championship season, and then signed with the Samsung Lions of the KBO League and won the 2002 Korean Series with them.

Tuffy Rhodes played for the Buffaloes for eight seasons from 1996 to 2003, hitting 288 home runs over that span. In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh&#x27;s record. Rhodes also played in tandem with Norihiro Nakamura, who also hit 46 home runs that same season. Together, they became a deadly hitting tandem, and the Buffaloes had one of the most dominant offenses in the league.

Despite the efforts of Rhodes and Nakamura, the Buffaloes could still not win the Japan Series, as they lost to the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in 5 games in the 2001 Japan Series. The Buffaloes are the second team to make the Japan Series but never win it, the first being the short lived Shochiku Robins, who only made the Japan Series in NPB&#x27;s inaugural season, losing to the Mainichi Orions (now Chiba Lotte Marines) before folding at the end of the following season and being merged with the Taiyo Whales (now Yokohama DeNA BayStars).

=== Sale and merger ===

In 2004 the team was sold to the Orix Group, the owner of the Orix BlueWave baseball team. The new owner then announced that the financially challenged Buffaloes and BlueWave would be merged into one team, called the Orix Buffaloes, before the start of the 2005 NPB season. At the time, Kintetsu Railway, the Buffaloes&#x27; owners, were in ¥1.3 trillion (or $11.2 billion today) in debt. This caused Buffaloes legend Tuffy Rhodes to sign with the Yomiuri Giants as Kintetsu was not able to strike up the multi year deal he wanted.

The proposed merger of the teams led to the biggest crisis in the traditional two-league structure in NPB and finally caused the first baseball player strike in Japan. The dispute officially ended after the two groups reached consensus on September 23, 2004. As part of the agreement, the Rakuten Golden Eagles were newly created (at a reduced &quot;entry fee&quot;) to keep the former six-team league structure. Other agreements included the leagues adopting interleague play to help the Pacific League gain exposure by playing the more popular Central league teams. All these changes took place before the 2005 season.

== Mascots ==

The Buffaloes had 2 mascots, named Buffie and Falulu (バフィリード and ファルルリーナ). Buffie is a male buffalo and was introduced in 1997. He also appeared on the team logo. Falulu is a female buffalo. Buffie&#x27;s jersey number is 100 while Falulu&#x27;s is 200. They were retired in 2005 after the Buffaloes merged with the then-named Orix BlueWave (present day Orix Buffaloes). Buffie reappeared in a Buffaloes reprint match in 2013. They also had 2 other mascots as part of the same group, named Capelot and Balbarock, with Capelot being a much more child-like character, whilst Balbarock was supposed to resemble the club&#x27;s cap logo. Both were retired in 2000. All 4 were designed by Hanna-Barbera Productions, and their backstory was that they lived in a fantasy world of dreams and adventures named &quot;Buffalo Valley&quot;, as described in the club&#x27;s 1997 supporters&#x27; handbook. However, after the merger, only Buffie&#x27;s copyright trademark was transferred to Orix Corporation.

Before they were introduced, the team&#x27;s mascot was a human character named Buffer (バッファくん), who served as the team mascot from 1976 to 1996. Logos of him usually depicted him holding a baseball bat and a ball, wearing the Buffaloes cap, raising one leg, whilst wearing Asics spiked shoes. However, a secondary logo primarily used by the team only had him holding a bat and ball. His jersey number was 100. He was designed by Yoshio Shirakawa. He was retired in 1997 following the Buffaloes&#x27; major logo and jersey overhaul, coinciding with their move to the Osaka Dome.

<text>Cryo Interactive Entertainment was a French video game development and publishing company founded in 1990, but existing unofficially since 1989 as a developer group under the name Cryo. The company gained recognition for its adventure games, such as the commercially successful titles &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Dragon Lore and ,&quot; along with the racing series &quot;MegaRace&quot;.

== History ==
Cryo was formed by members of ERE Informatique who left Infogrames (proprietor of ERE since 1986) – among these were Philippe Ulrich, Rémi Herbulot and Jean-Martial Lefranc.

The first game developed under the Cryo Interactive moniker was the hit &quot;Dune&quot;, which granted the newly formed software company both publicity and funding for further games under Virgin until 1996, when Cryo started self-publishing inside the European market, and in North America through then partially owned Canadian publisher DreamCatcher Interactive.

Cryo made its name mostly through adaptations of already existing stories (such as &quot;Riverworld&quot;, based on Philip José Farmer&#x27;s novel and &quot;Ubik&quot; by Philip K. Dick) or those based on historical scenarios (like &quot;KGB&quot;, a game set days before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and several games based in Ancient Egypt, Qing Dynasty&#x27;s China and Louis XIV&#x27;s France, developed with Cryo&#x27;s &quot;Omni3D&quot; engine). Although most of the post-Virgin games managed to capture and stay true to the original settings, poor interfaces and the lack of worldwide distribution turned little profit from each game.

By 1997, Cryo had experienced success in the US and France, and wanted to expand into Japan. They had focused their efforts on the US because it was a big market, and experienced difficulties in Japan due to changing distributors between games. They considered creating different sets of characters for the three markets, and setting up a US-based subsidiary.

=== Cryo Networks ===
A Cryo Interactive subsidiary called Cryo Networks, aimed at developing and publishing online applications exclusively, was established in December 1997. Aside from online multiplayer games (&quot;Deo Gratias&quot;, &quot;FireTeam&quot;, &quot;Treasure Hunt 2001&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot; and &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; being some of the titles released under this label), Cryo Networks also maintained a proprietary online multimedia development framework named SCOL (Standard Cryo On Line).

=== Cryo Studios North America ===
Cryo Studios North America was a video game design studio based in Portland, Oregon, USA, and was a subsidiary of Cryo Interactive. Cryo Studios was founded as Dark Horse Interactive (DHI) in the late 1990s, a joint venture of Cryo Interactive and Dark Horse Comics, and based in Dark Horse&#x27;s headquarters in Milwaukie, Oregon. In 1999, Cryo Interactive bought out Dark Horse&#x27;s share of DHI and renamed it Cryo Studios, relocating their offices to the Central Eastside Industrial District of Portland. Cryo Studios existed entirely as Cryo Interactive&#x27;s American subsidiary, producing games based on licensed properties.

Their first license (as DHI) was based on MTV&#x27;s animated science fiction series &quot;Aeon Flux&quot;. However, the license agreement was terminated before development was completed and the game was re-adapted into its own fictional universe as &quot;Pax Corpus&quot;. Shortly afterwards, DHI was granted the license to develop an interactive game based on Dark Horse&#x27;s own comic book series, &quot;Hellboy&quot;, written and drawn by Mike Mignola. The Windows version of &quot;&quot; was completed in 2000 after nearly four years of production; the intended PlayStation version of this game was put on ice. Their next project was to be based on Universal Classic Monsters, which included Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man. However, before any project made it out of pre-production, Cryo Interactive — quickly succumbing to the worldwide recession of 2001 — closed their North American branch. Cryo Interactive filed for bankruptcy a year later. In 2003, Canada-based Dreamcatcher Interactive — a former subsidiary of Cryo Interactive — finished development on and released the PlayStation version now retitled to &quot;Hellboy: Asylum Seeker&quot; in time for the theatrical release of the &quot;Hellboy&quot; movie, though the two are unrelated.

=== Demise and aftermath ===

By July 2002, not long after &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; flopped, the value of Cryo shares had plummeted and the financial situation of the company, who had closed its North American branch Cryo Studios the year before, was no longer sustainable. Cryo failed to negotiate a deal with its creditors, consequently filing for insolvency and making over 80 percent of its workforce redundant. Subsidiary Cryo Networks ceased operations shortly thereafter, leaving its then-ongoing projects &quot;DUNE Generations&quot; and &quot;Black Moon Chronicles: Wind of War&quot; unfinished. In October 2002, the parent company was put on liquidation, but subsequent negotiations ultimately caused DreamCatcher Interactive to absorb most of its assets and development teams, thus forming the base for DreamCatcher Europe.

The SCOL technology developed by Cryo Networks was released as an open source project in late 2002. Also following Cryo&#x27;s bankruptcy, its partnership with Italian developer Trecision fell through and Trecision managed to acquire publishing rights to its co-developed games &quot;Popeye: Hush Rush for Spinach&quot; and the Windows and PlayStation 2 versions of &quot;Zidane Football Generation&quot;. However, the former was cancelled and the latter was stripped of its Zinedine Zidane license and released as &quot;Calcio 2003&quot; in Italy and &quot;Football Generation&quot; in the rest of Europe, the PlayStation 2 version not being released until 2006, three years after Trecision itself had filed for voluntary liquidation.

Between 2003 and 2006, DreamCatcher division The Adventure Company released &quot;&quot;, in development at Cryo Interactive at the time it went bankrupt and completed posthumously, as well as new sequels in the Cryo trademark series of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Egypt 1156 B.C.&quot;. DreamCatcher also completed the PlayStation version of &quot;Hellboy: Dogs of the Night&quot;, originally developed for Windows by Cryo Studios, and released it as &quot;Hellboy: Asylum Seeker&quot; in 2004, to coincide with the release of the first feature film of the franchise.

DreamCatcher was acquired by Austrian publisher JoWooD Productions in November 2006. By March 2007, the company downsized DreamCatcher Europe to a publishing brand only and laid off its remaining development staff, effectively ending the Cryo legacy.

On 20 October 2008 Microïds acquired the brands and intellectual property of Cryo Interactive. Microïds also stated that they intended to distribute Cryo&#x27;s older games digitally, and that they were developing new games based on Cryo&#x27;s intellectual properties. Since the acquisition of Microïds by Anuman Interactive in November 2009, one game from the Cryo franchises that Anuman has planned for release is a sequel to &quot;Egypt III&quot;. As of December 2013, GOG.com had seven Cryo-developed games made available under its digital distribution service, namely &quot;Dragon Lore&quot; and the &quot;MegaRace&quot; and &quot;&quot; series.

== Critical reception ==

In July 2000, Francis Rozange of the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; wrote, &quot;[A] few years ago, at the time of &quot;Versailles&quot; and &quot;&quot;, [the Cryo name] was a guarantee of quality.&quot; However, he argued that the company&#x27;s name had since become a &quot;pejorative thing, vaguely synonymous with beautiful scenery (when one is lucky) and games that bore to death.&quot; &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported in 2001 that Cryo originally had a reputation for &quot;colorful, graphically opulent and content-wise light adventure games&quot;. Discussing Cryo&#x27;s pivot to online games in the early 2000s, writer Martin Schnelle remarked, &quot;With the decline of this [adventure] genre in general and also due to the low quality of its own products in particular compared to many competitors, the designers were forced to look for alternatives.&quot;

John Walker, who reviewed most of Cryo&#x27;s games for &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and gave them all negative reviews, described the studio&#x27;s work as &quot;always-awful but ever-so-sincere&quot;, adding that the studio &quot;defied sense, taste, and coherence to produce an endless stream of the worst, most clumsy, most drearily pre-rendered &quot;Myst&quot; clones the world has ever seen&quot;. Furthermore, Walker said that Cryo&#x27;s output consisted of &quot;Deadpan adventure games set in wholly ludicrous reinterpretations of out-of-copyright works of literature, in which nothing made sense, and all puzzles were unfathomable guesswork&quot;.

<text>Malinska () is a settlement (naselje) in the northwestern part of the island Krk in Croatia and an important tourist town. It lies on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, in the picturesque bay facing Opatija and Rijeka.

==Demographics==

The municipality of Malinska-Dubašnica has 3,212 inhabitants and the settlement itself has 816 (2021 census). Because of the catastrophic consequences of the privatization of the hotel complex &quot;Haludovo&quot;, the main entity in Malinska, during the 1990s almost completely destroyed, which in turn led to the loss of at least 150 jobs. This was reflected at the population of Malinska, which decreased by one third.
==Geography==

The settlement of Malinska is about 15 minutes from the Rijeka airport and can also be reached by car from the mainland crossing the Krk bridge. The city of Krk is located 12 km to the south.

Malinska harbor was used as a port due to its protection from bura wind as well as its depth. 

==Culture==

Every year, on July 23 the traditional &quot;Malinskarska Night&quot; takes place () — the day of the municipality and the feast of Saint Apollinaris, patron saint of the parish and settlement.

The parish church of St. Apollinaris is located in the vicinity - &quot;Bogovići&quot;. Built in the 19th century, it dominates Malinska. The new chapel of St. Nicholas in the center of the port was consecrated in 2000.

<text>The Procuratie (English: ) are three connected buildings along the perimeter of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square in Venice, Italy. Two of the buildings, the Procuratie Vecchie (Old Procuracies) and the Procuratie Nuove (New Procuracies), were constructed by the procurators of Saint Mark, the second-highest dignitaries in the government of the Republic of Venice, who were charged with administering the treasury of the Church of Saint Mark as well as the financial affairs of state wards and trust funds established on behalf of religious and charitable institutions.

The Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side of the square was built during the War of the League of Cambrai in the early sixteenth century to replace an earlier structure, damaged by fire. Although the war imposed financial constraints and limited innovation, it was nevertheless the first major public building in Venice to be erected in a purely classical style. It always contained apartments that were rented by the procurators as a source of revenue to finance building projects and repairs. Rental income was significant, given the prestige of the location. But the apartments were eventually sold to raise immediate money for the government, and several of them were subsequently transformed into clubhouses.
The Procuratie Nuove on the southern side housed the official residences of the procurators. Built between the late-sixteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries to replace a series of dilapidated medieval structures, it represented the culmination of an extensive programme of urban renewal that lasted over a hundred years and profoundly transformed Venice&#x27;s city centre, giving it the appearance of a great classical forum. Both the official residences in the Procuratie Nuove and the rental apartments in the Procuratie Vecchie were built above arcades with space on the ground floor that was rented out for stores, workshops, and later coffeehouses, including the historic Caffè Florian, Caffè Quadri, and Caffè Lavena.
The Procuratie Nuovissime (Newest Procuracies, also known as the Napoleonic Wing) was built during the second period of French occupation (1805–1815) when after the fall of the Republic of Venice, the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into the residence of the viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. Today, much of the Procuratie Nuove and the Napoleonic Wing house the Museo Correr.
==Procurators of Saint Mark==
 
The office of procurator of Saint Mark, considered second only to that of the doge in prestige, was one of the few lifetime appointments in the Venetian government. It was routinely occupied by nobles belonging to the most influential families and typically represented the climax of a distinguished political career, although it was often an intermediate position prior to election as doge.

The office originated in the ninth century with a single procurator &quot;operis Sancti Marci&quot;, nominated to assist the doge in the administration of the Church of Saint Mark, the ducal chapel. Over time the number of procurators increased. By the mid-thirteenth century there were four procurators, two of which, the procurators &quot;&quot;, retained responsibility for the administration of the Church of Saint Mark and its treasury. The other two procurators, called , administered trust funds established as pious donations on behalf of religious and charitable institutions. In 1319, there were six procurators, and in 1443 there were nine. These were divided into three procuracies: &quot;de supra&quot; (responsible for the Church of Saint Mark and its treasury), &quot;de citra&quot; (responsible for trust funds established in the &quot;sestieri&quot; (districts) of San Marco, Castello, and Cannaregio), and &quot;de ultra&quot; (responsible for trust funds established in the &quot;sestieri&quot; of San Polo, Santa Croce, and Dorsoduro). Beginning in 1516, initially to aid in the economic recovery from the War of the League of Cambrai, procurators could also be created in moments of financial constraint in exchange for monetary contributions to the treasury. This amounted to the periodic sale of the prestigious title. The number of procurators fluctuated thereafter: in 1521, there were eighteen. At times, the number rose to forty. The effective sale of the position also made it possible for young and ambitious nobles to quickly rise to high office and to consequently exert great influence. In the sixteenth century, notably Antonio Cappello, Vettore Grimani, Federico Contarini, and Andrea Dolfin purchased the office.

In addition to the associated public honour, the office of procurator ensured an active role in the political life of Venice: after 1453, it guaranteed a seat in the Senate. Apart from extraordinary embassies to foreign courts, the procurators were also relieved from the obligation incumbent upon all nobles to accept political appointments, including on the Venetian mainland and in the overseas possessions, thus ensuring their presence in the city. The position also brought economic and financial influence through the management of vast amounts of capital and of investments in commercial and private real estate, in government bonds, and in securities and deposits. With the exception of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, the procurators &quot;de supra&quot; were also specifically responsible for the construction, maintenance, and management of the public buildings around Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, including the shops, food stalls, and apartments that were rented out as sources of revenue.

==Procuratie Vecchie==

===Historical background===

Following the enlargement of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square in the second half of the twelfth century, several buildings and lands in and near the square were donated as rental properties to the Commune of Venice, principally by Doge Sebastiano Ziani and his immediate descendants. Subsequently, the administration of many of the properties was delegated to the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;. The intention was to create a steady flow of revenue in order to fund further work on the Church of Saint Mark and provide charitable assistance to the poor, thus avoiding the need to rely upon private pious donations and state financing. The properties included the long building erected by Ziani along the northern side of the square. As shown in Gentile Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Processione di Corpus Domini in Piazza san Marco&quot; (1496), it was a two-storey building with a series of apartments above and shops on the ground floor that were leased.

A fire in June 1512 destroyed one of the apartments near the clocktower and led to the collapse of a portion of the façade. It was subsequently decided that notwithstanding the financial constraints at the time of the War of the League of Cambrai (1508–1516), the entire structure would be rebuilt as a statement of Venice&#x27;s self-confidence. Significantly, Marin Sanudo remarked in his diary that the reconstruction was &quot;in order to make it very beautiful for the glory of the land … despite the war&quot; (&quot;farle di novo e bellissime, che sarà onor di la terra … ben sia la guerra&quot;).

The architect of the Procuratie Vecchie is not known from any official source, and various names have been suggested, primarily on the basis of stylistic considerations and the prominence of the individual architect at the time. These include Mauro Codussi, Pietro Lombardo, and Antonio Abbondi. With regard to the sixteenth-century sources, Marin Sanudo mentions the little-known Tuscan architect Zuan Celestro in his diary (1514), whereas Francesco Sansovino in his guide to the city (1581) attributes the design to , the &quot;proto&quot; (consultant architect and buildings manager) to the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;. But the precise contributions of Bon and Celestro to the design remain unclear. Bon, as &quot;proto&quot;, was nevertheless responsible for oversight during construction.

===Construction===
====Bon&#x27;s superintendence (ca. 1514–1529)====
Construction began with the damaged section adjacent to the clock tower and proceeded gradually. To limit the loss of revenue to the procurators, each tenant was evicted only when it became necessary to demolish the apartment in order to continue building. Also, the new shops on the ground floor and apartments above were leased as soon as they were ready. By 1517, the first section had progressed far enough to begin work on the façade with the in Istrian limestone. That same year, the first new apartment was rented out.
With respect to the pre-existing structure, the layout of the new building was altered for the first 24 arcades with the insertion of a small street running parallel to the square. In contrast, the earlier layout, characterized by a series of courtyards, was retained for the remainder of the building, further away from the area damaged by the fire. This indicates that, although documents refer to the demolition of the previous structure, certain parts of it were in fact maintained and reutilized, presumably to minimize costs.

====Sansovino’s superintendence (1529–1538)====
Following the death of Pietro Bon in 1529, Jacopo Sansovino, a refugee from the Sack of Rome, was nominated in his place as &quot;proto&quot; to the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;. The final eight bays of the Procuratie Vecchie, containing five apartments, and the five bays along the western side of the square (subsequently demolished) were completed under Sansovino&#x27;s direction.

===Architecture===
====Layout====
Given financial constraints during the War of the League of Cambrai, innovation was limited to design modifications that were aimed at increasing revenue to the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;, foremost of which was the addition of a floor to increment the number of rental apartments. Also, the number of workshops and stores on the ground floor was increased by inserting a narrow street behind the row of stores that opened onto the square so that each arcade now corresponded to an individual shop. On the upper floors, the rooms in the back section, connected by suspended galleries, were destined for servant quarters associated with the principal apartments that looked onto the square.

====Façade====

The Procuratie Vecchie was the first major building erected in Venice in of classical prototypes. Although many aspects of the earlier Veneto-Byzantine structure were maintained, including the decorative crenellation along the roofline and the succession of two window bays over each of the ground-floor arches, the elongated stilted arch, characteristic of the Veneto-Byzantine tradition in Venice, was updated with Renaissance semi-circular arches, supported on fluted Corinthian columns. Also, the columns on the ground floor, reminiscent of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, were replaced with square Doric pillars. This adhered to Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s recommendation in his architectural treatise, &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;, that in larger structures the column, inherited from Greek architecture, should only support an entablature, whereas the arch, inherited from Roman mural construction, should be supported on square pillars so that the resulting arcade appears to be the residual of &quot;a wall open and discontinued in several places&quot;.

===Later history===
The Procuratie Vecchie was rental property managed by the procurators &quot;de supra&quot; for much of its history. At various times, the shops on the ground floor housed a goldsmith, glazier, cobbler, engraver, tailor, spice merchant, painter, cutler, old-clothes seller, barber, bookseller, and notary. In 1638, the &#x27;Rimedio&#x27; wine shop opened. It was subsequently purchased by Giorgio Quadri and transformed into Caffè Quadri. Other coffeeshops in the Procuratie Vecchie eventually included &#x27;Re di Francia&#x27;, &#x27;Abbondanza&#x27;, &#x27;Pitt l&#x27;eroe&#x27;, &#x27;Orfeo&#x27;, &#x27;Redentore&#x27;, &#x27;Coraggio&#x27;, &#x27;Speranza&#x27;, and &#x27;Specchi&#x27;. &#x27;Alla Regina d&#x27;Ungheria&#x27;, the modern-day Caffè Lavena, opened in 1750.

Due to the enviable site, the rents for the apartments above were relatively expensive, ranging from 40 to 70 ducats a year in 1569. But during the Cretan War (1645–1669) against the Ottoman Empire, it was necessary to sell the apartments in order to raise money to finance the war effort. Although the apartments were later repurchased by the procurators, they were definitively sold in 1717. Inside the Procuratie Vecchie, several of the apartments were subsequently transformed into small gathering places for entertaining, relaxation, and, at times, gambling. These were termed either &quot;casini&quot; (little houses) or &quot;ridotti&quot; (probably derived from meaning to go, typically to a place of meeting or gathering). Most notably, the Procuratie Vecchie housed the &#x27;Casin dei nobili&#x27;, a large clubhouse for noblemen located on the first floor, and the &quot;casino&quot; for foreign diplomats, who were not permitted to socialize with the Venetian nobility, located in the wing of the Procuratie Vecchie on the western side of the square.

==Procuratie Nuove==
===Historical background===

In sharp contrast to the newly built Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, the southern side was still lined with several antiquated structures. These included the rent-free apartments erected in the thirteenth century for the procurators as well as their &quot;ridotti&quot; (offices), which were located inside a separate building dating back to the reign of Pietro I Orseolo (976–978). This building, the , had originally been constructed as a hospice to give aid and shelter to the pilgrims arriving in the city to venerate the relics of Saint Mark. Later, it served as an almshouse for women.

Conditions in the outdated and precarious apartments were poor, and expenditures for repairs continued to rise for both the occupants and the government. Some procurators, despite the obligation imposed by the Great Council and the Council of Forty, refused to take up residence in the square. Citing the dark and damp conditions and, in some instances, the lack of a view, they preferred to live in their palatial homes elsewhere in the city. Other procurators sublet their official apartments as a source of personal revenue. In addition, there were only six official apartments, two for each of the procuracies (&quot;de supra&quot;, &quot;de citra&quot;, and &quot;de ultra&quot;) which were assigned to the next senior procurator upon vacancy. This number of apartments was insufficient, and the government incurred the additional expense of a rent allowance to enable the remaining procurators to secure living space near the square.

On 14 July 1536, the procurators &quot;de supra&quot; consequently commissioned Jacopo Sansovino, their &quot;proto&quot; (consultant architect and buildings manager), to present a model for a three-storey building that was to substitute the hospice and apartments along the entire southern side of the square and continue in front of the Doge&#x27;s Palace where it was to replace the five hostelries for foreign merchants, the lean-to bread shops, and the meat market. No records survive regarding the ensuing internal discussions, but the project was radically transformed. On 6 March 1537, it was decided that the construction of the new building, now with only two floors, should begin with the section directly in front of the palace and that the space should be destined for the &quot;ridotti&quot; of the procurators as well as the library, consisting in the precious collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts, entrusted to the care of the procurators, that Cardinal Bessarion had donated to the Republic in 1468 with the request that a library of public utility be founded. There was no further reference to a continuation along the southern side of the square until the 1550s when work was nearing completion on the initial construction stage of the library. At that time, it was suggested that the library be extended to the waterfront and that the entire square be lined with new structures. But no action was taken.

Conditions in the buildings on the southern side of the square continued to deteriorate giving rise to concerns for the dignity of the procurators, and on 10 December 1580, the Senate determined that the time had come to demolish the buildings, citing once again their age and the unsightly appearance. Three designs were submitted for the building that was to house the new apartments of the procurators, and on 5 April 1582, the design of Vincenzo Scamozzi was accepted.

===Construction===

On 15 January 1581, the procurators decided that the new building would be constructed not on the exact site of the hospice and existing apartments but further back, in line with the library. This would make the bell tower a freestanding structure. It would also transform Saint Mark&#x27;s Square into a trapezoid, giving greater visual importance to the Church of Saint Mark located on the eastern side. Presumably, this had been Sansovino&#x27;s intention when in 1537 he began the construction of the library further away from the bell tower.

The decision to replace the dilapidated structures with a new building for the procurators was in fact the culmination of the &quot;renovatio urbis&quot;, the vast architectural programme begun under Doge Andrea Gritti to reaffirm Venice&#x27;s international prestige after the earlier defeat at Agnadello during the War of the League of Cambrai and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian Peninsula at the end of the War of the League of Cognac. The programme, which included the mint (begun 1536), the library (begun 1537), and the loggia of the bell tower (begun 1538), called for the radical transformation of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square from an antiquated medieval town centre with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient Roman Republic and, in the aftermath of the Sack of Rome in 1527, to present Venice as Rome&#x27;s true successor.
The building programme was strongly advocated by the , the wealthy and influential families within the aristocracy who maintained close ties with the Papal court and whose architectural and artistic tastes tended to reflect developments in Rome and central Italy. They saw the transformation of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square into a classical forum as the means to publicly affirm their own cultural orientation and their superior intellectual understanding of the principles of Ancient Roman architecture as outlined by Vitruvius in &quot;De architectura&quot;. Economically, the had largely abandoned maritime trade in favour of the administration of agricultural properties on the mainland. In their foreign policy, they tended to support the interests of the Church and of the Holy Roman Empire. But the building programme was increasingly opposed by the more traditionalist and pro-French faction within the government, the , who resisted the attempts of the to leave a lasting architectural mark. Hence when after the constitutional crisis of 1582-1583 the found themselves in a position of greater strength vis-à-vis the , they actively sought to limit any further change to Saint Mark&#x27;s Square.

Disapproval of the magnitude and grandeur of the project was voiced as early as 1589 when the design was criticized for its rich adornment, considered disparagingly more appropriate to a theatre in reference to Scamozzi&#x27;s work at the Olympic Theatre in Vicenza. The opposition to the building programme intensified following the death in 1595 of procurator Marcantonio Barbaro, Scamozzi&#x27;s chief supporter, with radical proposals to demolish the part that had already been completed and erect a structure similar to the Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side of the square. It was alternatively suggested that the project be returned to its original two-floor design. Ultimately, the Senate deliberated that the construction would continue with all three floors. But the design was radically altered, and Scamozzi was dismissed in 1597.

====Scamozzi&#x27;s superintendence (1583–1597)====
In March 1581, prior to the definitive selection of Scamozzi&#x27;s design, demolition of the previous structures began with a portion of the old pilgrim hospice and proceeded gradually as more space was required to continue. Actual construction began in 1583. Although Scamozzi was directly involved in every aspect, oversight fell to the &quot;proto&quot; (chief building consultant) to the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;, Simone Sorella, whose own design for the new building had been rejected. In 1584, Scamozzi presented further design proposals that included an additional floor. This would allow for separate apartments on each of the upper floors. It was similarly suggested that a floor be added to the library which was nearing completion. But following the equivocal results of engineering surveys conducted to determine whether the existing foundation of the library could bear the additional weight, it was decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors. Instead the proposal to raise the height of the Procuratie Nuove was accepted.

====Later periods of superintendence (1597–ca. 1660)====

By the time of Scamozzi&#x27;s dismissal in 1597, only the first ten arcades had been built. The project was thereafter entrusted to Francesco di Bernardin Smeraldi, called Fracà, who was also nominated &quot;proto&quot; in 1600 upon the death of Sorella. That same year, the two single-floor apartments already under construction according to Scamozzzi&#x27;s design were completed, and the first apartment was assigned the following year. Smeraldi then radically reconceived the design as a series of narrower, multi-level apartments. He also simplified the overall decoration. By 1611, the building had reached the twentieth arcade and four apartments were completed. Smeraldi was succeeded as &quot;proto&quot; by Mario della Carità and subsequently, in 1640, by Baldassare Longhena who completed the construction of the Procuratie Nuove around 1660, including the seven arcades that reached the Church of San Geminiano on the western side of the square.

===Architecture===

====Layout====
Despite the need to increase the number of apartments available to the procurators, Scamozzi&#x27;s design was for only six apartments. These were divided into three consecutive units, each eleven arcades wide. The two apartments on the upper floors, one atop the other, shared a single courtyard with staircases and entries onto the square and the canal behind. Each apartment consisted of two sections. The forward section, facing the square, had the principal rooms and a study. It was connected by means of two loggias, running alongside the courtyard, to the back section which had rooms for family members and service areas. Only the first two apartments, begun by Scamozzi, follow this original design. Smeraldi&#x27;s new design was for narrower apartments, only five arcades wide, that were distributed on multiple floors. Each apartment corresponded to four stores on the ground floor and an archway leading to an inner courtyard that opened to the canal behind. A staircase from the courtyard provided access to the apartment above. By adding another three arcades to the overall project, the number of apartments was increased to seven. An eighth apartment was added on the western end of the square.

====Façade====
For the first two floors, Scamozzi was obliged to continue Sansovino&#x27;s design for the library. But in his architectural treatise &quot;L’Idea dell’Architettura Universale&quot; (&quot;The Idea of a Universal Architecture&quot;), he is highly critical of Sansovino&#x27;s entablatures, which he states are excessive in height with respect to the columns. The arches are consequently said to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned. In the Procuratie Nuove, Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, corrects the &#x27;error&#x27; by reducing the height of the Ionic frieze, without, however, successfully resolving the problem of transitioning between the two buildings.

In Sansovino&#x27;s library, the ground floor consists in a series of Doric columns, supporting an entablature, that is superimposed on an arcade. The ancient prototypes are the Theatre of Marcellus and the Colosseum in Rome. Similarly, on the upper floor of the library, a row of large Ionic columns is superimposed on a series of Serlians. Scamozzi, while acknowledging the existence of both Roman and Renaissance precedents, was critical of such layering. In his design for the additional floor of the Procuratie Nuove, the series of Corinthian columns rests against a simple wall. As a result, the third level lacks the deep recesses and the strong chiaroscuro effect of the lower floors.

The wall between the Corinthian columns is pierced with rectangular aedicule windows, topped by alternating curvilinear and triangular tympanums. The solution of the alternating tympanums had been employed by both Bramante and Raphael for residential architecture and by Palladio for Palazzo Porto and Palazzo Chiericati. Palladio also proposed the combination in his design for the rebuilding of the Doge&#x27;s Palace after the fire of 1577, which may have been the immediate source for Scamozzi. The ancient prototype is the Pantheon where the altars alternate around the perimeter, in pairs, with curvilinear and triangular pediments. Scamozzi&#x27;s design for the upper floor included elaborate carvings and reclining figures atop the tympanums. But these were eliminated from the design by Smeraldi and exist only above the first ten windows, completed during Scamozzi&#x27;s superintendence.

===Later history===
The apartments of the procurators occupied the upper storeys. The shops on the ground floor were rented out as sources of revenue. In 1683, a coffeeshop was present, the sole such establishment in Venice. Thereafter the number of coffeeshops in the Procuratie Nuove increased and eventually included &#x27;L’Angelo Custode&#x27;, &#x27;Duca di Toscana&#x27;, &#x27;Buon Genio&#x27;, &#x27;Doge&#x27;, &#x27;Imperatore&#x27;, &#x27;Imperatrice delle Russie&#x27;, &#x27;Tamerlano&#x27;, &#x27;Fortuna&#x27;, &#x27;Diana&#x27;, &#x27;Dama Veneta&#x27;, &#x27;Aurora&#x27;, &#x27;Piastrelle&#x27;, &#x27;Pace&#x27;, and &#x27;Arabo&#x27;. The historic Caffè Florian, initially named &#x27;Venezia Trionfante&#x27;, opened in 1720.

After the fall of the Republic of Venice to Napoleon, the Procuratie Nuove was adapted to serve as the official residence of Eugène de Beauharnais, the viceroy of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, during the second period of French domination (1805–1815). The former apartments of the procurators were decorated by Giovanni Battista Canal and Giuseppe Borsato between 1807 and 1813, under the influence of the French decorator Charles Percier who was in Venice in 1807. For the decoration of the throne room and the dining room, Pietro Moro and Sebastiano Santi were also involved. Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua collaborated in other rooms. Modifications were also made in 1834–1836 and 1853–1857, during the subsequent period of Austrian domination (1815–1866), when the Procuratie Nuove served as an imperial residence. After the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, the Procuratie Nuove came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919. Since 1922, the building houses the Correr Museum.

==&quot;Ridotti&quot; of the procurators==

The offices of the procurators, called &quot;ridotti&quot;, were originally located in the section of the old pilgrim hospice that directly faced Saint Mark&#x27;s Square. In 1591, after the completion of the final five bays of the library by Vincenzo Scamozzi (1588), the offices were moved to the upper floor of the new library building when the remaining section of the hospice was demolished in order to continue the construction of the Procuratie Nuove.
The offices of the procurators &quot;de supra&quot; were located in the portion of the library completed earlier by Sansovino, directly facing the Piazzetta and the Doge&#x27;s Palace, whereas the offices of the procurators &quot;de citra&quot; and &quot;de ultra&quot; were situated in the area built by Scamozzi. Curiously, in 1552 when the library was still under construction, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the carnival celebrations in the Piazzetta.
The designated area for the offices, accessible by means of the same entry as the library, consisted in nine rooms, three for each of the procuracies. The rooms utilized by the procurators &quot;de supra&quot; were prominently positioned at the top of the monumental staircase as an indication of their prestige. The first of the rooms served as an archive for documents, the second as a room for administrative officials and clerks in attendance, the third for plenary meetings.
Paintings, primarily portraits of the procurators and devotional works, were transferred from the previous offices and adapted to the new rooms by Tintoretto, under the direction of Scamozzi. In the offices of the procurators &quot;de supra&quot;, the portraits were hung in double rows, the meeting room being reserved for the portraits of the procurators who had subsequently been elected as doges.
Following the fall of the Republic of Venice, the art collection of the &quot;ridotti&quot; was removed and in part dispersed when the library was annexed to the Procuratie Nuove as the royal apartment for Eugène de Beauharnais, the viceroy of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. The former &quot;ridotti&quot; were decorated by Felice Giani between 1807 and 1808 with neoclassical motifs, allegorical figures, and mythological scenes that exalt moral and intellectual virtues.

==Procuratie Nuovissime (Napoleonic Wing)==

===Historical background===
When during the second period of French domination the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into a royal residence, the former apartments of the procurators were adapted for residential purposes. But the structure lacked a suitably grand entry as well as larger rooms for audiences and entertaining. In 1807, the Church of San Geminiano, located on the western side of the square, was consequently demolished to have the space needed to extend the royal residence and create the necessary rooms. The church, dating back to the reign of Sebastiano Ziani (1172–1178), had been rebuilt in the early sixteenth century by Cristoforo da Legname and then completed by Jacopo Sansovino in 1557 with the addition of a dome and the façade. It was flanked on both sides by the wings of the Procuratie Vecchie and the Procuratie Nuove, built respectively by Sansovino and Longhena.

Proposals for the building that was to replace the church and join the wing of the Procuratie Vecchie with the wing of the Procuratie Nuove varied. Although the imperial French government sought a sense of monumentality, the projects of Grazioso Buttacalice for a triumphal arch and of Gaetano Pinali for a Corinthian portico were both deemed too radical and equally incongruous with the overall aspect of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square. Giovanni Antonio Antolini’s more modest design for a two-storey loggia with a grand staircase in the rear was accepted.

===Construction===
In 1810, Antolini&#x27;s project was abandoned and the section of the building already constructed was demolished. The wing of the Procuratie Vecchie was also demolished and replaced by the actual building, designed by Giuseppe Maria Soli, professor of Architecture at the University of Modena, in a Neoclassical manner.

===Architecture===
The first two floors of the Napoleonic Wing continue the repeatable bays of Sansovino&#x27;s design for the library which Scamozzi had also used for the Procuratie Nuove on the southern side of the square. To then visually link the new building to the northern side, Soli designed an attic floor, the height of which corresponds to the roofline crenellation of the Procuratie Vecchie. The attic was also conceived as a means of concealing the high, vaulted ceiling of the ballroom behind.

The façade of the attic is covered in low relief panels with classical motifs. Interspersed with these reliefs are freestanding statues on pedestals by Antonio Bosa and Domenico Banti. These portray heroes, statesmen, and rulers, primarily from Antiquity, that were seen as embodying Napoleonic ideals. The statue in the centre, depicting Napoleon enthroned as Jupiter, was removed during the second period of Austrian domination. Similarly, the decorations in the staircase with the triumphs of Napoleon were replaced.

<text>Joseph Greenwood (1818 – 18 July 1861) was a soldier and New Zealand politician.

Greenwood was born in St Pancras, London. His parents were Thomas Greenwood and Esther née Munden. He joined the 31st Regiment of Foot in Bengal, India, where he distinguished himself as a lieutenant, under General George Pollock in the First Anglo-Afghan War, and wrote an account which was considered an authority on the campaign.

In 1847 he went to New Zealand as brigade major on staff of Major-General George Dean Pitt (1781–1851), and in the same capacity served Major-General Robert Wynyard (1802–1864) on the death of General Pitt. He served in the first and second New Zealand Parliaments, representing the Pensioner Settlements electorate consisting of the Auckland suburbs of Howick, Onehunga, Ōtāhuhu, and Panmure. He resigned from Parliament on 3 August 1857, around halfway through its second term. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council, representing the Pensioner Settlements electorate from 1855 to 1857.

In 1850 he travelled from Auckland to Taupō, and published an account of his travels. Greenwood owned extensive properties in Mangarei (Māngere), and built a house there in 1852. He died at No. 21 Cumberland Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London on 18 July 1861 aged 42.

His son Colin Halkett Greenwood (1846–1894), was a landscape painter.

<text>The Montagnard Foundation, Inc. () is a political organization whose mission is to protect the rights of the Montagnard/Degar peoples of Vietnam, who belong to over thirty indigenous ethnic groups in the Central Highlands. It is a non-profit organization, founded in 1990 and based in South Carolina in the United States designated as a Militant group by Vietnam. The Montagnard Foundation has spoken out against Vietnam&#x27;s policies that affected the Montagnards. The organization was designated as a separatist group by the Vietnamese government.

The Montagnard Foundation is led by exiled leader Kok Ksor who was a member of Transnational Radical Party and brought the persecution of the Montagnard people to the platform of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation. The Foundation states that its goal is to protect the rights, preserve the lives and the culture of the Montagnard people through nonviolent means and not in an independent state. The MFI&#x27;s mission is to &quot;promote and protect the human rights of the indigenous Montagnard people of Vietnam.&quot; The organization seeks to achieve this goal through a variety of means, including advocacy, education, and direct assistance to Montagnard communities in Vietnam. The MFI&#x27;s programs include legal assistance for Montagnards facing persecution, support for Montagnard refugees, and education initiatives to promote awareness of Montagnard culture and history.

The MFI has been a vocal critic of the Vietnamese government&#x27;s treatment of Montagnards, particularly in the areas of land rights and religious freedom. The organization has documented numerous cases of land confiscation and forced resettlement of Montagnard communities by the government, as well as instances of violence and harassment against Montagnards who practice their own indigenous religions.

In addition to its advocacy work, the MFI has also been involved in efforts to provide direct aid to Montagnard communities in Vietnam. The organization has established a network of community centers in the Central Highlands region, which provide education, healthcare, and other basic services to Montagnard communities. The MFI also operates a program to resettle Montagnard refugees in the United States and other countries, providing assistance with the resettlement process and support for refugees once they arrive.

The MFI&#x27;s work has received both praise and criticism. Supporters of the organization view it as a crucial voice for an often-overlooked minority group and a necessary advocate for human rights in Vietnam. Critics, however, argue that the MFI&#x27;s focus on Montagnard separatism risks inflaming ethnic tensions in Vietnam and undermining the country&#x27;s stability. Despite these criticisms, the MFI continues to be a leading voice for Montagnard rights and a key player in the ongoing struggle for indigenous rights in Vietnam. Montagnards have been subjected to harassment, imprisonment, and torture for their political activities, including advocating for greater autonomy or independence.

Despite these challenges, the Montagnard separatist movement remains relatively small and fragmented. Some Montagnard leaders have called for greater autonomy within Vietnam rather than full independence, while others advocate for secession and the establishment of a separate Montagnard state. However, the movement has been hindered by a lack of cohesive leadership, limited resources, and the Vietnamese government&#x27;s crackdown on dissent.

The Vietnamese government has been quick to denounce the Montagnard separatist movement as a threat to national unity and stability. The government has accused separatist groups of being influenced by foreign governments and organizations, particularly the Montagnard Foundation, Inc. The government has also used security forces to crack down on Montagnard activists and restrict their access to information and communication technologies.

<doc id="974367" wikidata="Q3749707" url="?curid=974367" title="Rockin' in the Free World">
<text>&quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; is a song by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Neil Young, released on Young&#x27;s seventeenth studio album &quot;Freedom&quot; (1989). Two versions of the song bookend the album, similarly to &quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&quot; from Young&#x27;s &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; album, one of which is performed with a predominantly acoustic arrangement, and the other predominantly electric. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Rockin&#x27; In the Free World&quot; number 214 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

== Context ==
Young wrote the song while on tour with his band The Restless in February 1989. He learned that a planned concert tour to the Soviet Union was not going to happen and his guitarist Frank &quot;Poncho&quot; Sampedro said &quot;we&#x27;ll have to keep on rockin&#x27; in the free world&quot;. The phrase struck Young, who thought it could be the hook in a song about &quot;stuff going on with the Ayatollah and all this turmoil in the world.” He had the lyrics the next day.

The lyrics criticize the George H. W. Bush administration, then in its first month, quoting Bush&#x27;s famous &quot;thousand points of light&quot; remark from his 1989 inaugural address and his 1988 presidential campaign promise for America to become a &quot;kinder, gentler nation&quot;. The song also refers to Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s proclamation that the United States was the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 campaign slogan, &quot;Keep hope alive&quot;. The song was first performed live on February 21, 1989, in Seattle with The Restless, without the band having rehearsed it.

The song is included on Young&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2004) release. It reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
Young would perform the song live in September 1989 for the television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. For the performance, Young played with Poncho Sampedro, Charley Drayton and Steve Jordan. In concert, Young would typically play the song well into the set, when the band&#x27;s energy is at a high. To achieve the same level of energy, Young worked out with his trainer 30 minutes prior to the performance. He explained to author Jimmy McDonough: 

Comedian and former &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Dennis Miller would later say that &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; was the single greatest performance on the show in its history.

==Charts==
==Cover versions==
&quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; has been recorded by numerous other artists. A version by The Alarm appears on their album &quot;Raw&quot; (1991). Pearl Jam, joined by Neil Young, performed the song at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards and frequently perform it live in concert. Justin Sullivan in 1994 did it not with his New Model Army line up but recording with the lead guitarrist at the time Dave Blomberg touring in a series of duo presentations which it was known as Big Guitars in Little Europe. Suzi Quatro covered it on her 2005 album &quot;Back to the Drive&quot;. It was also covered by Swiss hard rock band Krokus on their 2017 covers collection &quot;Big Rocks&quot;. Roots rock duo Larkin Poe released a cover on their 2020 album &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot;. American nu metal band Soil released a cover in 2022. Numerous bands and artists have covered this song live, including Simple Minds, Bon Jovi, Joe Satriani and The New Roses

==Use of the song in US politics==
An edited cut of the electric version of the song was used over the final credits of Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and the song was re-released as a single at the time of the film&#x27;s release.

Since its release the song has been used a number of times at different US political events.

In 2015 and 2016, the song was played during Donald Trump&#x27;s entrance preceding his formal announcement that he would run as a Republican candidate for the 2016 presidency. Young, a longtime supporter of Bernie Sanders, said that Trump&#x27;s use of &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; was not authorized. The contention, later determined to be a licensing issue, was resolved, and Trump&#x27;s campaign used the song. Young explained to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he had no issue with the campaign using the song.

Bernie Sanders also used the song at rallies for his 2016 presidential campaign.

In 2020, Trump again used the song at a pre-Fourth of July speech at Mount Rushmore on July 3, along with two other Young songs (&quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot;). A tweet from Young from the official Neil Young Archives Twitter account responded to the usage of &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World” by retweeting a tweet from &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot; reporter Morgan Matzen that contained a video with the song playing at the Trump event with Young adding &quot;This is NOT ok with me…&quot;. A minute later Young retweeted a second Matzen tweet, this time one showing a video of Young&#x27;s song &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; playing before the President took the stage, with Young adding &quot;I stand in solidarity with the Lakota Sioux &amp; this is NOT ok with me.&quot; On August 4, 2020, Young filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against the Trump campaign for copyright infringement for its use of &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Sidewalk&quot; after both songs had been removed from ASCAP&#x27;s political license. On December 7, 2020, Young voluntarily dismissed the case.

In May 2024, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sang and played rhythm guitar on the song with Ukrainian punk rock band 19.99 at a bar in Kyiv, Ukraine. Blinken was in the Ukrainian capital to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss battlefield updates and the significance of recent U.S. military aid. This visit was the first by a Biden administration official since the approval of U.S. supplemental funding for Ukraine.

The song was most recently used at the 2024 Democratic National Convention on August 21, 2024 after Tim Walz gave the final speech of the evening to the assembled, with Young&#x27;s approval.

<text>The National Museum of the American Indian–New York, the George Gustav Heye Center, is a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, New York City. The museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. The center features contemporary and historical exhibits of art and artifacts by and about Native Americans.

The center has its origin in the &quot;Museum of the American Indian&quot; founded by George Heye in 1916. It became part of the national museum and Smithsonian in 1987.

==History==
The center is named for George Gustav Heye, who began collecting Native American artifacts in 1903. He founded and endowed the Museum of the American Indian in 1916, and it opened in 1922, in a building at 155th Street and Broadway, part of the Audubon Terrace complex, in the Sugar Hill neighborhood, just south of Washington Heights. Frederick J. Dockstader was director of the Museum from 1960 to 1976.

By early 1987, U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was proposing legislation that would turn over the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, on Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan, to the Museum of the American Indian. For the past ten years, the museum had wished to relocate because its Upper Manhattan facility was insufficient, and the Custom House was being offered as an alternative for the museum&#x27;s possible relocation to Washington, D.C. Mayor Ed Koch and U.S. senator Al D&#x27;Amato were initially opposed to Moynihan&#x27;s plan, but dropped their opposition by August 1987. U.S. senator Daniel Inouye introduced the National Museum of the American Indian Act the next month, which would have instead merged the museum&#x27;s collection with that of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. A compromise was reached in 1988, in which the Smithsonian would build its own museum in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian would also acquire the Heye collection, which it would continue to operate in New York City at the Custom House. The act was passed in 1989.

The George Gustav Heye Center opened in the Custom House in 1994. The Beaux Arts-style building, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, was completed in 1907 and is both a National Historic Landmark and a New York City designated landmark. In 2006, a renovation project reworked space on the ground floor into the Diker Pavilion, adding approximately of space available for public display and events. The center&#x27;s exhibition and public access areas total about . The Heye Center offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.

==Galleries==
The permanent collection of the Heye Center is called Infinity of Nations, and is designed to show the scope of the Smithsonian&#x27;s collection. Organized by geographic regions (including Central and South America), the exhibit displays over 700 items and crosses the line from ethnology to art. Multimedia interactions include audio and video, and feature commentary by historians on specific objects.

The rotunda on the second floor is frequently used as a performance space, and features murals reflecting the history of the building, done by Reginald Marsh.

Other galleries include the Photography Gallery, Special Exhibit Galleries, Contemporary Galleries, the Haudenosaunee Discovery Room, the Resource Center Reference Library, a small theater (which screens daily films), and the museum store.

The ground floor of the building houses the Diker Pavilion for Native Arts and Culture and the imagiNATIONS Activity Center, opened in 2018. The former education center was colloquially known as &quot;The Tipi Room&quot;.

Students selected items from the collection, created 3D panorama QuickTime objects, and wrote essays which were used as HTML tags. The Washington DC facility later emulated what was done in New York with students from Weedon Island, creating a virtual tour of objects relevant to their interests and cultural heritage.

<text>Bulkhead line is an officially set line along a shoreline, usually beyond the dry land, to demark a territory allowable to be treated as dry land, to separate the jurisdictions of dry land and water authorities, for construction and riparian activities, to establish limits to the allowable obstructions to navigation and other waterfront uses. 

In particular, it may limit the construction of piers in the absence of an official pierhead line.

Various jurisdictions may define it in different ways. A formal definition may read as follows: &quot;A geographic line along a reach of navigable water that has been adopted by a municipal ordinance and approved by the Department of Natural Resources, and which allows limited filling between this bulkhead line and the original ordinary high water mark, except where such filling is prohibited by the floodway provisions.&quot; (Several municipalities in Wisconsin use wording closely approximating this sample.)

<text>The BR Standard Class 8 was a class of a single 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; steam locomotive designed by Robert Riddles for use by British Railways. Only the prototype was constructed, which was christened Duke of Gloucester. Constructed at Crewe Works in 1954, the &quot;Duke&quot;, as it is popularly known, was a replacement for the destroyed LMS Princess Royal Class locomotive number 46202 &quot;Princess Anne&quot;, which was involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash of 1952.

The &quot;Duke&quot; was based on the BR Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; design. It incorporated three sets of modified Caprotti valve gear, relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more efficient than Walschaerts or Stephenson valve gear. The &quot;Duke&quot; was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its heavy fuel consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also proved disappointing, revealing problems with the draughting of the locomotive, which caused difficulties in adhering to the timetables.

Consequently, the unique locomotive had an operational life of only eight years. It was taken to Woodham Brothers scrap yard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, but was saved from being cut up when it was purchased by a group of railway enthusiasts, who restored it to as-built condition over 13 years. Since then, modifications have been made to the original design, creating one of the most efficient and powerful steam locomotives ever to run in Britain. As a result, the &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; has been frequently seen on the mainline around Britain. , the locomotive was being overhauled to return it to operational condition.

== Background ==
Riddles had frequently argued the case for the inclusion of a Standard Class 8 &quot;Pacific&quot; in the standard range of locomotives being introduced by British Railways. However, those proposals were rejected by the Railway Executive on the grounds that attempting to develop a new form of steam motive power was unnecessary because there were enough Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; locomotives already available for use.

However, opportunity came out of adversity when the short-lived rebuild of the former LMS Turbomotive, 46202 &quot;Princess Anne&quot;, was destroyed in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail disaster of 1952. A gap then existed in the roster for locomotives with 8P power classification, for which there was high demand to allow the efficient operation of heavy expresses on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Scotland. That gave Riddles the perfect opportunity to press the case for his new design, a prototype of which was duly authorised for construction.

== Design details ==
At first, Riddles wanted to develop an enlarged version of his Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannias&quot;, because that design still featured a two-cylinder layout. However, the size of the cylinders needed to achieve the 8P power classification would mean that the locomotive was outside the British loading gauge, so a reluctant reversion to the three-cylinder layout ensued. That reluctance was born from experience with the Gresley &quot;Pacifics&quot;, in which the conjugated valve gear was difficult to maintain, due to the middle cylinder being located between the frames. Therefore, an alternative type of valve gear had to be found.

A rotary cam-driven form of Caprotti valve gear was settled on, as developed by Heenan &amp; Froude, using poppet valves. It was based on Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders, as well as improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting when compared to the more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper, that created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive, capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors, and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction, combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.

The main problem was known even when the locomotive was under construction, because L.T. Daniels, the representative of the British Caprotti company, recommended the use of the Kylchap blastpipe, which could have coped with the fierce exhaust blasts experienced with the Caprotti system. A standard double chimney of the Swindon type had already been fabricated in order to cut costs and it had been installed in the smokebox, supposedly before Riddles could do anything about it. As a result, the locomotive suffered due to the choke area of both the chimney and blastpipe being much too small for the pressure created by the exhaust, which led to poor draughting.

Further problems relating to the firebox of the locomotive were only discovered during its restoration, including a poorly dimensioned ashpan, and dampers that were too small, starving the fire of air when operating at speed. Further, concurrent with the construction of 71000, British Railways &quot;Modernisation Plan&quot; was under development, raising questions about the need for the locomotive.

Following the occasional appearance of cracks near the spring brackets of the Britannias and &quot;Clans&quot;, a substantial rearrangement took place in that area, which resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel &quot;sub-frames&quot; carrying the ten front-most spring brackets, and lengthened spring brackets behind the rear driven axle. Perhaps remarkably, they were not integrated into a cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher, the pony truck pivot stretcher being a fabrication. Had the planned batch of smaller Pacifics been built, they would have been fitted with that arrangement.

==Construction history==
The opportunity to create an entire batch of locomotives within the 8P category was declined by the Railway Executive. It had been said that was because the design process had been very expensive and complex, so that when the locomotive emerged from Crewe Works in 1954, the construction of similar locomotives was seen as inappropriate, especially given the 1955 Modernisation Plan. As a result, 71000 remained the solitary member of the proposed class of Standard 8P locomotives.
===Naming the locomotive===
After emerging from Crewe Works in 1954, the locomotive was named &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; prior to entering revenue-earning service. Had further locomotives been constructed, they would have belonged to the &quot;Duke&quot; Class, standing alongside the sister locomotives of the &quot;Britannia&quot; and &quot;Clan&quot; Classes. Since then, the locomotive has colloquially been referred to by steam enthusiasts and crews as the &quot;Duke&quot;.

== Operational details ==
The &quot;Duke&quot; was highly unpopular with crews, who regarded it as something of a liability due to its poor steam production. Inefficiencies caused by the problems regarding its draughting abilities and firebox design meant that no further examples were constructed. The fact that no effort was made to rectify the problems indicates the change in policy regarding steam locomotives, with the Modernisation Plan coming into operation just as the &quot;Duke&quot; entered service. Based for its entire working life at Crewe North depot, the locomotive was used to haul boat trains on the undemanding North Wales Coast Line between Crewe and Holyhead. All those factors culminated in the locomotive having a short service life of only eight years, being withdrawn from service in 1962. The reputation of the locomotive amongst its crews as being a poor steamer was eventually to disappear, but only after it was rebuilt following its rescue from the scrap yard in 1974.

==Livery and numbering==
The livery of the &quot;Duke&quot; was a continuation of the British Railways standard class practice. The class was given the power classification 8P. Following on from the &#x27;Britannias&#x27;, the &quot;Duke&quot; was numbered under the British Railways standard numbering system in the 71xxx series. The &quot;Duke&quot; was given the number 71000, and featured brass nameplates with a black background, located on the smoke deflectors.

== Preservation ==
After withdrawal, the &quot;Duke&quot; was selected for inclusion in the National Railway Museum, but it was later decided that only the cylinder arrangement was of interest. One of the outside cylinders was removed for display at the Science Museum, and the other was removed to restore balance in readiness for scrapping. The locomotive was purchased by Dai Woodham, though it was initially sent to the wrong scrapyard. After being retrieved, the &quot;Duke&quot; languished for many years in Woodham Brothers scrapyard, before enthusiasts purchased the locomotive in 1974, forming the Duke of Gloucester Steam Locomotive Trust.

Restoration began in earnest, though with many components missing, the most expensive of which being the Caprotti valve gear, it took 13 years of effort on the part of enthusiasts, with assistance in the guise of sponsorships from industry, to return the locomotive to near as-built condition. One of the very few compromises made was replacing the previous steel cylinders with spheroidal graphite iron.

Two significant construction errors were discovered during restoration:
* The chimney was too small compared with other locomotives of similar size, resulting in poor boiler draughting at times of high steam demand.
* The firebed (grate) air inlet dampers had not been built to the drawings and were too small, resulting in poor air supply and inefficient combustion.

Those errors were corrected and the opportunity was taken to incorporate some other improvements, including the previously recommended Kylchap exhaust system, which finally unlocked the locomotive&#x27;s true potential as a powerful express passenger locomotive. When the &quot;Duke&quot; was first allowed to haul a full load on the main line, it became immediately obvious that the boiler was producing steam at a more efficient rate and that the reborn &quot;Duke&quot; was unrecognisable from the failure experienced under British Railways ownership. With the modifications, the &quot;Duke&quot; is now one of the most powerful steam locomotives ever to run on Britain&#x27;s railways, past or present (the LMS Coronation Class Pacifics held that title under British Railways auspices - the three cylinder &quot;Duke&quot; never actually achieved the 3000 cylinder horse power figure that was recorded by the four cylinder Princess Coronation Class). Ironically, it is not only more powerful than the English Electric Type 4 diesel locomotives which replaced it directly in service, but also the type 4 and 5 diesel locomotives built to replace the earlier diesels.

In the 1995 &quot;Shap trials&quot; (30 September to 3 October) 71000 broke the record for the fastest northbound ascent and achieved the highest Estimated Drawbar Horsepower (EDHP) figures during the event, its average over the Shap ascent was 2300 EDHP and peak 2803. The Duchess of Hamilton (46229) generated EDHP figures of 2150 and 2343 respectively. The A4 Sir Nigel Gresley (60007) suffered from poor coal and possible leaking tubes so only achieved an EDHP of 1671 (average) and 1812 (peak).

In preservation, the &quot;Duke&quot; had an impeccably reliable operational record. However, on 9 June 2007, the engine operated a railtour from to Carlisle returning via , where, for operational reasons, the locomotive&#x27;s start position was changed to . A little over into the journey, the locomotive was stopped at with leaking tubes in the firebox and removed from the train. It was withdrawn for repairs and returned to service in January 2008.

Because the locomotive now bears little mechanical resemblance to that which operated under British Railways, it has also been used as a test bed, incorporating several other modifications and innovations. They are intended to investigate how much further the locomotive&#x27;s performance can be enhanced, raising speculation about the capabilities of an entire batch of Standard class 8 &quot;Pacifics&quot; had history been different. In 2012, the locomotive was withdrawn from service because its boiler ticket expired. After many setbacks, the boiler was fired up and tested in late 2023. , the locomotive is in the final stages of its overhaul and was expected to be operational sometime later that year.

==Models==
A ready-to-run model in O scale, produced by Ace Trains, was released in Summer 2019, built to coarse scale standards, which apply mainly to the wheels rather than the model more generally. Uniquely, the model has a representation of working Caprotti valve gear

The only well-documented construction of working live-steam scale model of &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; in Model Engineer magazine was by Denis Evans, of Blackpool, England. Beginning in the 1966, and using original drawings from British Railways and Associated Locomotive Equipment (a subsidiary of Heenan &amp; Froude), Evans built three &quot;Dukes&quot;, with fully working Caprotti valve gear, first in 7¼ inch gauge, and then 5 inch and 3½ inch gauges. The 7¼ inch gauge &quot;Duke&quot; won awards at the 48th Model Engineer Exhibition in 1979, as did his 3½ inch gauge locomotive at the 61st Model Engineer Exhibition in 1992.

<text>Aurelio Faustino Monteagudo Cintra (; November 19, 1943 – November 10, 1990), nicknamed &quot;Monty&quot;, was a right-handed screwball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball. He was the son of former big-leaguer René Monteagudo.

==Career==
Monteagudo was born in Caibarién, Villa Clara Province, Cuba. He moved to Venezuela after Fidel Castro&#x27;s rise to power in his homeland.

As a 19-year-old rookie, Monteagudo made his majors debut with the Kansas City Athletics on September 1, 1963. After three-plus seasons with Kansas City, he was dealt to the Houston Astros on May 17, 1966. At the end of the season, he received Venezuelan citizenship. Then, he joined the Chicago White Sox on July 16, 1967, with a new nationality. After a season in Chicago, he played with the Kansas City Royals (1970) and California Angels (1973).

Monteagudo was traded along with Chris Coletta from the Angels to the Phillies for Denny Doyle at the Winter Meetings on December 6, 1973, completing a transaction from four months earlier on August 14 when Philadelphia purchased Billy Grabarkewitz&#x27;s contract from California.

In seven seasons, Monteagudo compiled a 3–7 record with 58 strikeouts, a 5.05 ERA, four saves, and 132 innings pitched in 72 games (65 as a reliever). He played his final majors game on September 28, 1973.

Monteagudo also played 20 seasons in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League with five teams: Caracas (1963–68), Magallanes (1968), La Guaira (1968–74, 1976–82) and Portuguesa (1975), compiling a 79–81 record with 897 strikeouts and a 3.37 ERA. On December 20, 1973, Monteagudo kept the Cardenales de Lara hitless for innings until Faustino Zabala ruined the no-hitter with a single to center field.

At the same time, Monteagudo played in the Mexican League with the Puebla, Coahuila, Aguascalientes and Veracruz clubs. He pitched a no-hitter game against Nuevo Laredo (March 19, 1979) and led the league in strikeouts once (222, in 1978). After retiring in 1981, he started a successful managerial career in the league.

Aurelio Monteagudo was killed in a car accident in Saltillo, Mexico nine days before his 47th birthday.

<text>Marie Watt (born 1967) is a contemporary artist living and working in Portland, Oregon. Enrolled in the Seneca Nation of Indians, Watt has created work primarily with textile arts and community collaboration centered on diverse Native American themes.

==Background==
Marie Watt was born in 1967 in Seattle, Washington. She majored in Speech Communications and Art at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. She also explored museum studies at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. She holds an AFA degree from the Institute of American Indian Arts, a BS degree from Willamette University and an MFA degree in Painting and Printmaking from Yale University. Watt is a member of the Turtle Clan of the Seneca Nation and her father&#x27;s family were Wyoming ranchers. These two factors in her background have influenced her artwork; Watt describes herself as &quot;half Cowboy and half Indian.&quot;

==Artwork==
Watt works primarily with blankets as a material in her installation and collaborative works. She also prints lithography. For her sculpture and installation, she uses a variety of materials, including everyday objects, as well as textiles, alabaster, slate, and cornhusks. She cites Pop art, Abstract Expressionism, and indigenous visual traditions as sources for her work. Watt had a studio in Portland, Oregon and started experimenting with materials, such as corn husk, then began experimenting with woven blankets. In 2002, her stone sculpture &quot;Pedestrian&quot; was installed along the east bank of the Willamette River in Portland. Her work has appeared in several exhibitions in the Pacific Northwest.

Watt involves community effort when creating artworks. Her project &quot;Blanket Stories: Transportation Object, Generous Ones&quot; at the Tacoma Art Museum involved creating large-scale installations out of blankets donated by the community. Not only are the blankets the medium but &quot;Watt believes that blankets provide access to social connections, historical traditions, and cross-cultural meanings.&quot; Watt hosts sewing circles, groups who gather and work such as with the piece &quot;Forget me not: Mothers and Sons&quot; in which they constructed portraits of servicemen (and one woman) from Oregon killed in the Iraqi war.

==Career==
In September 2004, as part of the &quot;Continuum 12 artists&quot; series, an exhibit of her work opened in New York City and the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian. The exhibit included &quot;Blanket Stories&quot;, a sculpture made of two towers of wool blankets, with each stack sewn together with a central thread. She collected the blankets over several years, including many Hudson&#x27;s Bay point blankets that were given to Native Americans in trade by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company during the 19th century.

In 2011, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation commissioned Watt to produce a site-specific artwork for their Seattle campus. The work, entitled &quot;Blanket Stories: Matriarch, Guardian and Seven Generations&quot;, is a 14-foot column of wool blankets from all over the world and is located in the building&#x27;s lobby. Describing how the materials fit this specific location, Watt wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s the first column I&#x27;ve made with the explicit goal of collecting and integrating blankets from around the world, echoing the Foundation&#x27;s global mission; the column will be constructed of reclaimed blankets and reclaimed cedar, in resonance with the campus&#x27; goal of attaining LEED Gold certification.&quot;

In 2014, 350 people contributed to an outdoor sculpture at Tacoma Art Museum. The towers she made were cast in bronze and she posted a micro-website with stories behind each blanket. Watt listens to her material and pulls from a deep sense of community and narrative to create works with history. Her works are both figurative and abstract.

From 2017 to 2023, Watt served as a member of the board of directors for VoCA (Voices in Contemporary Art), a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of contemporary art.

Watt is currently a professor at Portland Community College, and is the coordinator of its Northview Gallery. She is represented by PDX Contemporary Art in Portland, Oregon, Catharine Clark Gallery in San Francisco, California, and Marc Straus Gallery in New York City, New York.

<text>Raj Bhavan (&quot;Government House&quot;) is a residential palace and fort situated in Dona Paula, Goa, which serves as the official residence of the governor of Goa. The sprawling 88 acres estate is located on a cape in the Goan capital, Panjim. Known by the name &quot;Palácio do Cabo&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Palace of the Cape&quot;) until it gained official status as the residence of the governor of Goa, this palace is said to be built between the 16th and 17th centuries in the erstwhile Portuguese India. The fort is strategically positioned facing the Arabian sea opposite the well-preserved 17th century Forte Aguada.

==History==
In 1540, the eighth governor of Portuguese India, Estêvão de Gama, proposed the idea of constructing some fortifications to guard the entrance to the Goa harbor. As per their long-established defense strategy they quickly built a church and fort and subsequently attached a convent. The &quot;Cabo&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;cape&quot;) was converted into one of the best equipped and important fortresses over the years, although these days nothing remains of the old citadel that served as the Franciscan Convent. Since the canons were not often used, the buildings at some point of time were also used as temporary accommodation for the archbishop. Over course of time it became the official residence of the Portuguese governor of Goa.

It is said to be a strategically designed fort, not just holding panoramic views of the meeting of three water bodies, the Mandovi and Zuari rivers with the Arabian sea, but also of the river bay, Fort Aguada and the busy port of Mormugao. The scenic beauty and solitude combined with its uniqueness and planning are some of the attractions that remain at the &quot;Palacio do Cabo&quot;. The small church founded in 1541 at the very end of the mansion is dedicated to Our Lady of The Cape (&quot;Nossa Senhora do Cabo&quot;). This church also served as a landmark for the seafarers and celebrates its annual &quot;fest&quot; (feast) on 15 August.

The &quot;Palácio do Cabo&quot; is now known as the &quot;Raj Bhavan&quot;, the official name given to the residence of the governors of the states in India. It is also said to be among the finest residences of Indian governors owing to its location and display of Portuguese-Goan architecture. Indeed, it is said to hold the title as the oldest as no other residence of a governor of India has its origin over four hundred years ago.

==Architecture and antiques==

The palace is a double-storey structure of great dimensions and architectural significance. While the ground level consists of the office chamber and residence of the governor in addition to few guest suites. The upper level holds halls for gatherings (Durbar hall), conferences and banquets along with the main kitchen and additional guest suites or rooms. A row of &quot;varandas&quot; (verandahs) elevated on pillars on the rear side of the mansion overlook the Mandovi river to the right, the Zuari river to the left, and the Arabian sea ahead.

Bohemian chandeliers, Chinese porcelain, silver and wooden furniture form the assets of this palace. The pieces of antique Chinese porcelain are said to be presumably manufactured in Canton. A worn-out set of crockery having a similar design with Portuguese coat of arms were specially ordered for the use of the Portuguese governor general. An excellent collection of high quality solid wooden furniture with exquisite workmanship adorn some of the spaces in this palatial mansion. A set of intricately carved chairs with figurines of Hindu gods and temples indicate the complete harmony between Christians and Hindus that existed in Goa. Five tall Cantonese vases believed to be over 300 years old as well as two large-sized Cantonese bowls, all of which hold the Portuguese coat of arms are among the prized antique items at the palace. So are two wooden Ormolu mounted chests with veneer wood inlay and carara marble tops. On the walls of the Durbar Hall are large mirrors and a painting of a fisherman by &quot;Francisco Jose Rezende&quot; (1866). Carved furniture of ingenious and rare workmanship form part of the collections of the palace – the quality of which has not diminished even after use for centuries, owing to the up-keep.

===Renovation===
During the years 1999 and 2000, the palace underwent a major renovation. In order to strengthen the structure as per expert advice, old wooden beams that held the upper level were replaced with steel beams. The beams are said to have been decayed over the years. The process was carried out in phases to allow for careful alterations and avoid any damages to the historically significant structure. In areas behind the palace facing the Arabian sea, considerable distress had been faced over the last few years in turn calling for major remedial steps to protect and preserve this historical building.

==Landmarks==

=== Our Lady of The Cape Church ===
The over 500 year old Catholic church also known as &quot;Nossa Senhora do Cabo&quot; occupies a corner on the site with views of the bay and sea. It is open for morning masses on all Sundays as well as on special occasions like Christmas, Easter and the annual church feast. The Feast is celebrated on the morning of 15 August which also coincides with the Independence Day of India. Thousands of devotees, cutting across religious lines, attend the special prayers held on this occasion. A &quot;&#x27;fest&#x27;&quot; and &quot;&#x27;mela&#x27;&quot; is held annually on this day on the premises.

===Grotto===
A small distance away from the main church located on the slope, after descending through steps is the grotto dedicated to St. Paula. The altar in this grotto is installed in a cut-out of the cape rock and holds the saint&#x27;s sculpture in a recumbent position. Behind it lies the image of Jesus on a trefoil cross. There is a common belief that those who offer prayers here will have their wishes fulfilled. The history associated with it as written on a board hung at the place, states as follows:

&quot;&quot;St. Paula (347 – 404 A.D.), a Roman Senator&#x27;s widow and her daughter Eustochium were living an austere life in Rome when St. Jerome (341 – 420 A.D.) came there from Palestine in 383 A.D. Four years later, mother and daughter followed the great doctor to Palestine and went with him to Egypt to visit the hermits in the Nitrain desert. Upon returning to the Holy Land, they settled at Bethlehem. Here, they erected a monastery under St. Jerome&#x27;s direction and three convents ruled by St. Paula&quot;.&quot;

The Feast of the Grotto is celebrated in the evening on 2 August. A large number of faithful living on the estate as well as the nearby areas attend this annual tradition.

===The estate===
The &quot;Palácio do Cabo&quot; estate is surrounded on three sides by sea and has a total area of about 80 acres. One massive laterite stone wall exists to the East which serves as the estate&#x27;s boundary on that side. On the sea-shore side there are masonry walls which have withstood the onslaught of time for over four centuries. The flat table land in the middle of the estate covers about 3/4th of the total land but it has steep side slopes towards the water bodies. About 5 hectares of the flat table land is occupied by buildings, gardens, lawns, and the remaining is full of vegetation consisting of large number of species of trees, plants, shrubs, creepers, etc. Adding new species of trees in large number has been an annual phenomenon at the palatial estate. The premises also have a kitchen garden where seasonal vegetables are grown.

The main garden in front of the palace consists of three lawns enclosed by seasonal flower beds. The Palacio estate has got the best prize for its well maintained gardens in year 2000 (State of Goa) and also bagged the second prize the following year. Various species of birds flock to the estate taking advantage of its location and vegetation. These include peacocks, eagles, kingfishers, tree-pies, doves, bee-eaters, etc. There are also a variety of reptiles like pythons, cobras, rat-snakes, chameleons and monitor-lizards. Smaller animals like mongoose, hare, jackals, squirrels and porcupines also reside on the estate. There have been no known cases over the years of any harm causes to residents or visitors alike. However the estate foot fall is also limited to the main buildings and surrounding areas. Special care is taken to protect, preserve and enrich the flora and fauna of the Palacio estate. In its form, the estate seems to serve as a treasure-house of bio-diversity incorporating the diverse flora and fauna of the Western Ghats.

===The Estate Beach===
Another tourist spot in the Palacio estate is a narrow strip of beach only accessible by a series of steps. There is a natural spring with sweet water about 20 meters away from the sea water towards the property. From here one can get a view of the Mormugão harbor. However, it is not safe for diving.

===Cannon Point===
On the western side just a three minutes drive from the main palace through the dense vegetation is a spot named &quot;Cannon Point&quot;. A small park complete with pathways and lighting have been provided at this location owing to its scenic nature. Two old Portuguese-era cannons were retrieved from the shore below and placed on pedestals here.

===The Jetty===
There is also a non-operational jetty located where the Mandovi river joins the sea. It is presumed to have been in active use in the yesteryear&#x27;s. Near the Portuguese era jetty is a flat area bound with scores of trees particularly the coconut tree, that gives enchanting Goa its paradise charm. This is an deal place to relax and let time pass in the typical &quot;Sussegado&quot; style. There is also a small narrow sandy strip but the place is not practical for swimming. Customary to Goan way of life, an old well daunts the estate at a comfortable 30 meters away from the sea coast.

==British Cemetery==
Just outside the gates of &quot;Palacio do Cabo&quot;, there is a 180-year-old cemetery which is the only remaining evidence of the presence of the British forces in the fortress. British military personnel were stationed in Goa from 1799 to 1813, in order to assist the Portuguese against the French First Empire during the Peninsular War. During this period the British also constructed several edifices in the Forte Aguada, Gasper Dias and Mormugão areas but most of these were demolished by the Portuguese in 1848 leaving little presence, if any, of their arrival. The cemetery was built sometime in 1802 to serve the purpose of British garrisons stationed at Forte Mormugão, Palacio do Cabo and Forte Aguada. Mr. W. Walker, a traveler once described the cemetery in 1855. He stated:

&quot;I visited the burial ground at Cabo built and used by the British force of 10,000 (sic) men when they held possession of the seaboard points of Goa, to prevent the French entering India by this route in 1805. The massive laterite stone wall which surrounds it is as perfect as the day it was built, the laterite in this neighborhood being the best I have anywhere seen, but the lofty arched entrance gates have long been despoiled of every particle of wood. The burial ground is used for rice cultivation and the very tombstones are worn down from the sharpening of native tools on them; where not cultivated, it is overgrown with high rank grass said to be alive with deadly cobras de capello. If it be true, as I have heard, that the Collector of Belgaum allows an annual sum to keep in order, I can assure him that not a piece worth of care is bestowed on it.&quot;

On 19 May 1869 a request was made by the then Government of British India to the governor-general of Portuguese India to repair and maintain the cemetery, which was considered by the Portuguese government in Goa. Sr. Gerson da Cunha described the cemetery in 1878 as an oblong area about 180 yards by 145 yards long with an enclosed wall all around and a massive ornamental gate of teak wood. The key to this door was with the chaplain of a neighboring convent. There are 47 tombstones and 56 gravestones in the cemetery.

The cemetery which was repaired by the British consul in 1941 is now in good condition. The old wooden gate has since been replaced by a metal one. Out of the six mango trees which were there in the past, two have survived. There is a well inside the cemetery which is dry. The earliest burial according to the tomb plates was on 19 December 1808 and the latest on 10 August 1912.

<text>Admiral Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, GCB (born Alexander Forrester Cochrane; 23 April 1758 – 26 January 1832) was a Royal Navy officer and politician who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and achieved the rank of admiral of the blue. He captained off Alexandria, Egypt during the French invasion of Egypt and Syria. 

Cochrane was knighted into the Order of the Bath for his services in 1806. In 1814 he became vice admiral and commander-in-chief of the North American Station, led British naval forces during the attacks on Washington and New Orleans, and was promoted to admiral in 1819 and became commander-in-chief of the Plymouth naval base.

== Naval career ==
Alexander Inglis Cochrane was a younger son of the Scottish peer Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald, and his second wife, Jane Stuart. He joined the Royal Navy as a boy and served with British naval forces in North America. He served during the American War of Independence.

Cochrane also participated in the Egyptian operations in 1801. When Alexandria fell, Cochrane, in the 74-gun third-rate , with the sixth-rate , , the brig-sloops and , and three Turkish corvettes, were the first vessels to enter the harbour.

About 1802–1803, Cochrane alienated the Spanish governor of Ferrol, Galicia, when one of his commanders intercepted four ships of the Spanish treasure fleet returning from South America, before they reached Cádiz. The effect of Cochrane&#x27;s actions was to bring Spain back into the war on France&#x27;s side in 1804.

Cochrane also had been incensed that the brilliant Sir Edward Pellew, a &quot;tarpaulin officer&quot; (an officer who had worked up from being a seaman), had been preferred over himself, a well connected aristocrat, as Admiral of the White to become Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. Cochrane tried to implicate Sir Edward Pellew, who had good relations with the Governor of Ferrol, in fraud, then making seriously damaging and unfounded allegations against Sir Edward&#x27;s secretary Fitzgerald. These were never substantiated and destroyed Fitzgerald&#x27;s career but didn&#x27;t accomplish the destruction of its target, who later became Viscount Exmouth.

==In the Caribbean==

In 1805 Cochrane was made commander of the Leeward Islands Station. He conducted operations against the French and Spanish on 6 February 1806 at the Battle of San Domingo during the Napoleonic Wars. A cannonball blew his hat off his head while he was on the deck of his flagship, . He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 29 March 1806 in recognition of his service. Other rewards included thanks from both Houses of Parliament, freedom of the city of London, and a sword valued at 100 guineas.

In Barbados, Cochrane met with General Francisco de Miranda, who had been defeated by Spanish naval forces in an attempt to liberate Venezuela. As Spain was then at war with Britain, Cochrane and the governor of Trinidad agreed to provide some support for an unsuccessful second attempt to invade Venezuela.

Following the concern in Britain that neutral Denmark was entering an alliance with Napoleon, Cochrane, now a rear admiral, in 1807 sailed in (74 guns) as commander of the squadron of ships that were sent to occupy the Danish West Indies. In 1809 he commanded naval forces in the conquest of Martinique. On 25 October 1809 he was promoted to the rank of Vice Admiral. He held the position of Governor of Guadeloupe from 6 February 1810 to 26 June 1813. Cochrane also owned the &quot;Good Hope&quot; slave plantation in Trinidad.

&quot;No individual had greater responsibility for the decision to recruit and arm American slaves than did Alexander Cochrane.&quot; Cochrane formed two Corps of Colonial Marines, made up primarily of escaped slaves. The first corps was based on the island of Marie-Galante and operated from 1808 to 1810. The larger second corps (the first had been disbanded), formed in 1814, was disbanded in 1815, at the conclusion of the War of 1812.

==War of 1812==


From April 1814, during the War of 1812 against the United States, Cochrane, then a vice admiral, served as commander-in-chief of both the North American Station, based at the new dockyard in Bermuda, and the Jamaica Station, based at Port Royal. He landed the force under Major-General Robert Ross that burned Washington and pushed successful naval forays at the same time. Initially he wanted to attack Rhode Island in New England after the success at Washington, but he was dissuaded by Ross and Rear Admiral George Cockburn, who wanted to go after the bigger prize of Baltimore, Maryland.

Cochrane was appointed the Commander-in-Chief, North American Station (1814–1815). His correspondence log commences with mention of the correspondence dated 27 December 1813 from the Admiralty which formally appointed him as successor to Sir John Warren.

Cochrane approved the plan proposed by Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet to attack Washington, after the latter predicted that &quot;within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital&quot;. The 4,500 troops, commanded by Major General Robert Ross, successfully captured the capital city on 24 August 1814; Ross then directed the Burning of Washington but refused suggestions by both Cochrane and Cockburn to raze the city. Ross ordered his troops to cause no damage to private property.

It was aboard Cochrane&#x27;s flagship, , near the mouth of the Potomac on 7 September 1814 that Francis Scott Key and Colonel John Skinner pleaded for and got the release of Doctor William Beanes, a civilian who had been taken prisoner in Upper Marlboro after withdrawing from the assault on Washington.
The next day Key, Skinner and Beanes were transferred to the frigate HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, with their truce vessel in tow, as the fleet slowly moved up the Chesapeake toward Baltimore. They would not be released until the assault on Baltimore was completed. On 11 September, Skinner insisted they be put back on their own truce vessel which they were allowed to do, under guard. 

The morning of the 12th, 4500 British troops landed on the North Point peninsula and started marching toward Baltimore. Major General Robert Ross was killed by sniper fire in a skirmish that afternoon before the Battle of North Point. 

Cochrane transferred his flag to HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; to facilitate moving up the Patapsco River to direct the 25-hour bombardment of Fort McHenry outside Baltimore (13 and 14 September), which proved ineffectual. He resisted calls by his junior officers to attack the fort more aggressively with frigates at close range. He ordered a diversionary raid by boats, around 1am on the 14th, to assist the army encamped near Baltimore in their proposed attack on Hampstead Hill (which they cancelled and withdrew), but this diversion had no success. In the bombardment of Fort McHenry, Cochrane&#x27;s fleet used bomb vessels and a rocket ship for a long-range bombardment to minimize casualties and damage to the fleet from the fort&#x27;s return fire, which inspired Francis Scott Key&#x27;s poem that became &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the US national anthem. 

Cochrane led the British force that won the Battle of Lake Borgne, in Louisiana, in December 1814 and also controlled the soldiers and marines on ships during the Battle of New Orleans. His forces built a hard short road to New Orleans for use by British armed forces. The British army was defeated at the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815 and Cochrane received some criticism for his role in that loss, which prevented the British from gaining a foothold in the US.

The Duke of Wellington was particularly vociferous in his criticism. He claimed that the failure of the New Orleans campaign was In a eulogy to General Edward Pakenham (Wellington&#x27;s brother-in-law, killed at New Orleans), he said:

I cannot but regret that he was ever employed on such a service or with such a colleague. The expedition to New Orleans originated with that colleague ... The Americans were prepared with an army in a fortified position which still would have been carried, if the duties of others, that is of the Admiral (Sir Alexander Cochrane), had been as well performed as that of he whom we now lament.
In spite of bearing some responsibility for the loss at New Orleans, Cochrane was later promoted to Admiral of the Blue in 1819. From 1821 to 1824, he was Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. He died in Paris on 26 January 1832.

== Political career ==
Cochrane was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling Burghs from 1800 to 1802, and from 1803 to 1806.

== Family ==

In 1788, he married Maria Shaw; they had three sons and two daughters. His son Thomas John Cochrane was entered in the Royal Navy at the age of seven; he rose to become governor of the colony of Newfoundland, and Admiral of the Fleet; he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath.

Alexander Cochrane was the sixth of the surviving sons of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald. The eldest son Archibald Cochrane became the earl and lost the family lands on a series of inventions and investments. Many of the younger sons served in the military or had careers supplying it. The next brother, Charles, served in the army and was killed at the Siege of Yorktown; he had married to Catherine, the daughter of Major John Pitcairn. The third surviving son, John Cochrane, was a paymaster and provisioner to the army and navy. His children included Nathaniel Day Cochrane, who became a rear admiral, and probably the chess player John Cochrane. The next son, Basil Cochrane, made a fortune supplying the Royal Navy in India. Alexander was the sixth son. The seventh, George Augustus Frederick Cochrane, had an army career and served in Parliament. The youngest son, Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, was an army officer, colonial governor, politician, and fraudster.

The Earl of St. Vincent wrote of the Cochrane brothers in 1806, &quot;The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight, they are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling—and there is not a single exception in any part of the family.&quot;

<text>Yucatec Maya ( ; referred to by its speakers as or ) is a Mayan language spoken in the Yucatán Peninsula, including part of northern Belize. There is also a significant diasporic community of Yucatec Maya speakers in San Francisco, though most Maya Americans are speakers of other Mayan languages from Guatemala and Chiapas.

== Etymology ==

According to the Hocabá dictionary, compiled by American anthropologist Victoria Bricker, there is a variant name , literally &#x27;flat speech&#x27;). A popular, yet false, alternative etymology of Mayab is &quot;ma ya&#x27;ab&quot; or &#x27;not many, the few&#x27;, which derives from New Age spiritualist interpretations of the Maya. The use of &quot;Mayab&quot; as the name of the language seems to be unique to the town of Hocabá, as indicated by the Hocabá dictionary and is not employed elsewhere in the region or in Mexico, by either Spanish or Maya speakers. As used in Hocabá, &quot;Mayab&quot; is not the recognized name of the language, but instead a &quot;nickname&quot; derived from a common nickname for the region, the Mayab (&quot;Mayab, the land of pheasant and deer&quot;), the use of which emerged in the colonial period. This use may also derive from the title of a self-published book by a Yucatec scholar, Santiago Pacheco Cruz (1969). The meaning and origins of &quot;Maya&quot; as the name of the language (versus Mayab) and as the ethnic identity (ethnonym) are complex questions — see etymology and social history of the word as ethnic identity and name of the language in Restall (2004) and Restall and Gabbert (2017).

Linguists have added &quot;Yucatec&quot; to the name in order to clearly distinguish it from all other Mayan languages (such as Kʼicheʼ and Itzaʼ). Thus, the use of the term Yucatec Maya to refer to the language is scholarly or scientific nomenclature. Native speakers do not qualify the language as &quot;Yucatec&quot;, calling it &quot;Maaya&quot;, &quot;maayaʼ tʼàan&quot;, or &quot;maasewal t&#x27;aan&quot; (literally &#x27;commoner language&#x27;) in their language and simply &quot;(el) maya&quot; when speaking Spanish.

In the Mexican states of Yucatán, some parts of Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Quintana Roo, Yucatec Maya is still the mother tongue of a large segment of the population in the early 21st century. It has approximately 800,000 speakers in this region. There were an additional 2,518 speakers of Yucatec Maya in Belize as of the 2010 national census.

Recently, scholars in the fields of history and anthropology have raised ethical and political questions about the continued use of the label &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; to the language that is known and named by native speakers as simply &quot;Maya&quot; (see Castañeda (2021), Castillo Cocom (2021), Hernandez Reyna and Castillo Cocom (2021), Restall (2004), Restall and Gabbert (2017). These scholars argue, both explicitly and implicitly, that the use of &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; manifests a continuation and propagation of neocolonial relationships, specifically the scientific imperialism of linguistics and the cultural hegemony of anglophone academia. The term &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; was invented in the early-mid 20th century by linguists so as to not confuse themselves with the use of word &quot;Maya&quot; (the actual name of the language) when this was used to reference the ancestral language (proto-language) of all the Mayan languages; this ancestral language is now no longer called &quot;Proto-Maya&quot;, but is instead called Proto-Mayan. The designation &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; has been understood by generations of US scholars to refer to the Yucatan Peninsula. However, &quot;Yucateco&quot; amongst Mexicans, especially non-academics, has always primarily referenced the state of Yucatan (located in the northwestern corner of the Peninsula with the same name) and, in particular, the ethnic-national identity and culture of this state. Thus, Maya linguists from Quintana Roo, for example Jaime Chi and Edber Dzidz Yam, have identified that the term actually introduces confusion, given that in common understanding among Mexicans the name Maya refers to the peoples and language living throughout the Peninsula while the phrase &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; would seem to denote a dialect of the Maya language that is spoken in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, in contrast to other regional dialects of Maya such as spoken in the states of Quintana Roo, or Campeche and in northern Belize. Thus, the above scholars argue, to continue to use the phrase &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; to refer to either the people or the language instead of the proper name, that is, Maya, used by the speakers of this language would be an injustice. On the new politics of using Maya and not Mayan as an ethnic label see:

== History ==

Yucatec Maya forms part of the Yucatecan branch of the Mayan language family. The Yucatecan branch is divided by linguists into the subgroups Mopan-itza and Yucatec-Lacandon. These are made up by four languages: 
*Itza
*Mopan
*Yucatec Maya
*Lacandon

All the languages in the Mayan language family are thought to originate from an ancestral language that was spoken some 5,000 years ago, known as Proto-Mayan.

The Maya had been in a stable decline when Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1517 AD. From 200 to 800 AD the Maya were thriving and making great technological advances. They created a system for recording numerals and hieroglyphs that was more complex and efficient than what had come before. They migrated northward and eastward to the Yucatán peninsula from Palenque, Jaina, and Bonampak. In the 12th and 13th centuries, a coalition emerged in the Yucatán peninsula among three important centers, Uxmal, Chichen Itza, and Mayapan. The society grew and the people were able to practice intellectual and artistic achievement during a period of peace. When war broke out, such progress was stalled. By the 15th century, the city of Tula had collapsed and was abandoned.

The Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus traded with Maya merchants off the coast of Yucatán during his expedition for the Spanish Crown in 1502, but he never made landfall. During the decade following Columbus&#x27;s first contact with the Maya, the first Spaniards to set foot on Yucatán soil did so by chance, as survivors of a shipwreck in the Caribbean. The Maya ritually sacrificed most of these men, leaving just two survivors, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, who somehow rejoined other Spaniards.

In 1519, Aguilar accompanied Hernán Cortés to the Yucatán island of Cozumel, and also took part in the conquest of central Mexico. Guerrero became a Mexican legend as father of the first Mestizo: by Aguilar&#x27;s account, Guerrero &quot;went native&quot;. He married native women, wore traditional native apparel, and fought against the Spanish.

Francisco de Montejo&#x27;s military incursion of Yucatán took three generations and three wars with extended fighting, which lasted a total of 24 years.

As the Spanish colonists settled more areas, in the 18th century they developed the lands for large maize plantations and cattle farms. The elite lived in haciendas and exported natural resources as commodities. The Maya were subjects of the Spanish Empire from 1542 to 1821.

During the colonization of the Yucatán peninsula, the Spanish believed that in order to evangelize and govern the Maya, they needed to reform Yucatec Maya. They wanted to shape it to serve their ends of religious conversion and social control.

Spanish religious missionaries undertook a project of linguistic and social transformation known as &quot;reducción&quot; (from Spanish &quot;reducir).&quot; The missionaries translated Catholic Christian religious texts from Spanish into Yucatec Maya and created neologisms to express Catholic religious concepts. The result of this process of &quot;reducción&quot; was &quot;Maya reducido&quot;, a semantically transformed version of Yucatec Maya. Missionaries attempted to end Maya religious practices and destroy associated written works. By their translations, they also shaped a language that was used to convert, subjugate, and govern the Maya population of the Yucatán peninsula. But Maya speakers appropriated &quot;Maya reducido&quot; for their own purposes, resisting colonial domination. The oldest written records in Maya reducido (which used the Roman alphabet) were written by Maya notaries between 1557 and 1851. These works can now be found in the United States, Mexico, and Spain in libraries and archives.

==Phonology==
A characteristic feature of Yucatec Maya, like other Mayan languages, is the use of ejective consonants: . Often referred to as glottalized consonants, they are produced at the same place of oral articulation as their non-ejective stop counterparts: . However, the release of the lingual closure is preceded by a raising of the closed glottis to increase the air pressure in the space between the glottis and the point of closure, resulting in a release with a characteristic &quot;popping&quot; sound. The sounds are written using an apostrophe after the letter to distinguish them from the plain consonants (&quot;tʼàan&quot; &quot;speech&quot; vs. &quot;táan&quot; &quot;forehead&quot;). The apostrophes indicating the sounds were not common in written Maya until the 20th century but are now becoming more common. The Mayan &quot;b&quot; is also glottalized, an implosive , and is sometimes written &quot;bʼ&quot;, but that is becoming less common.

Yucatec Maya is one of only three Mayan languages to have developed tone, the others being Uspantek and one dialect of Tzotzil. Yucatec distinguishes short vowels and long vowels, indicated by single versus double letters (ii ee aa oo uu), and between high- and low-tone long vowels. High-tone vowels begin on a high pitch and fall in phrase-final position but rise elsewhere, sometimes without much vowel length. It is indicated in writing by an acute accent (íi ée áa óo úu). Low-tone vowels begin on a low pitch and are sustained in length; they are sometimes indicated in writing by a grave accent (ìi èe àa òo ùu), though the 2014 INALI orthography uses no accent.

Also, Yucatec has contrastive laryngealization (creaky voice) on long vowels, sometimes realized by means of a full intervocalic glottal stop and written as a long vowel with an apostrophe in the middle, as in the plural suffix &quot;-oʼob&quot;.

===Consonants===

Some sources describe the plain consonants as aspirated, but Victoria Bricker states &quot;[s]tops that are not glottalized are articulated with lung air without aspiration as in English spill, skill, still.&quot;

===Vowels===
In terms of vowel quality, Yucatec Maya has a straightforward five vowel system:

For each of these five vowel qualities, the language contrasts four distinct vowel &quot;shapes&quot;, i.e. combinations of vowel length, tone, and phonation. In the standard orthography first adopted in 1984, vowel length is indicated by digraphs (e.g. &quot;aa&quot; for IPA ).

In fast-paced speech, the glottalized long vowels may be pronounced the same as the plain long high vowels, so in such contexts &quot;ka’an&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27; sounds the same as &quot;káan&quot; &#x27;when?&#x27;.

===Stress===
Mayan words are typically stressed on the earliest syllable with a long vowel. If there is no long vowel, then the last syllable is stressed. Borrowings from other languages such as Spanish or Nahuatl are often stressed as in the original languages.

===Debuccalization===
An important morphophonological process in Yucatec Maya is the dissimilation of identical consonants next to each other by debuccalizing to avoid geminate consonants. If a word ends in one of the glottalized plosives /pʼ tʼ kʼ ɓ/ and is followed by an identical consonant, the final consonant may dispose of its point of articulation and become the glottal stop /ʔ/. This may also happen before another plosive inside a common idiomatic phrase or compound word. Examples: ~ &#x27;Yucatec Maya&#x27; (literally, &quot;flat speech&quot;), and &quot;náak’-&quot; (a prefix meaning &#x27;nearby&#x27;) + &quot;káan&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27; gives &#x27;palate, roof the mouth&#x27; (so literally &quot;nearby-sky&quot;).

Meanwhile, if the final consonant is one of the other consonants, it debuccalizes to /h/: &quot;nak&quot; &#x27;to stop sth&#x27; + &quot;-kúuns&quot; (a causative suffix) gives &quot;nahkúuns&quot; &#x27;to support sb/sth&#x27; (cf. the homophones &quot;nah&quot;, possessed form &quot;nahil&quot;, &#x27;house&#x27;; and &quot;nah&quot;, possessed form &quot;nah&quot;, &#x27;obligation&#x27;), &quot;náach’&quot; &#x27;far&#x27; + &quot;-chah&quot; (an inchoative suffix) gives &quot;náahchah&quot; &#x27;to become distant&#x27;.

This change in the final consonant is often reflected in orthographies, so can appear as &quot;maya’ t’àan&quot;, &quot;maya t&#x27;aan&quot;, etc.

===Acquisition===
Phonology acquisition is received idiosyncratically. If a child seems to have severe difficulties with affricates and sibilants, another might have no difficulties with them while having significant problems with sensitivity to semantic content, unlike the former child.

There seems to be no incremental development in phonology patterns. Monolingual children learning the language have shown acquisition of aspiration and deobstruentization but difficulty with sibilants and affricates, and other children show the reverse. Also, some children have been observed fronting palatoalveolars, others retract lamino-alveolars, and still others retract both.

Glottalization was not found to be any more difficult than aspiration. That is significant with the Yucatec Mayan use of ejectives. Glottal constriction is high in the developmental hierarchy, and features like [fricative], [apical], or [fortis] are found to be later acquired.

==Grammar==
Like almost all Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya is verb-initial. Word order varies between VOS and VSO, with VOS being the most common. Many sentences may appear to be SVO, but this order is due to a topic–comment system similar to that of Japanese. One of the most widely studied areas of Yucatec is the semantics of time in the language. Yucatec, like many other languages of the world (Chinese, Kalaallisut, arguably Guaraní and others) does not have the grammatical category of tense. Temporal information is encoded by a combination of aspect, inherent lexical aspect (&quot;aktionsart&quot;), and pragmatically governed conversational inferences. Yucatec is unusual in lacking temporal connectives such as &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27;. Another aspect of the language is the core-argument marking strategy, which is a &#x27;fluid S system&#x27; in the typology of Dixon (1994) where intransitive subjects are encoded like agents or patients based upon a number of semantic properties as well as the perfectivity of the event.

==Orthography==
The Maya were literate in pre-Columbian times, when the language was written using Maya script. The language itself can be traced back to proto-Yucatecan, the ancestor of modern Yucatec Maya, Itza, Lacandon and Mopan. Even further back, the language is ultimately related to all other Maya languages through proto-Mayan itself.

Yucatec Maya is now written in the Latin script. This was introduced during the Spanish Conquest of Yucatán which began in the early 16th century, and the now-antiquated conventions of Spanish orthography of that period (&quot;Colonial orthography&quot;) were adapted to transcribe Yucatec Maya. This included the use of for the postalveolar fricative sound (which is often written in English as ).

In colonial times a &quot;reversed c&quot; was often used to represent (the alveolar ejective affricate). This sound is now represented by in the revised ALMG orthography and in the INALI orthography.

==Examples==
==Use in modern media and popular culture==

Yucatec-language programming is carried by the CDI&#x27;s radio stations XEXPUJ-AM (Xpujil, Campeche), XENKA-AM (Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo) and XEPET-AM (Peto, Yucatán).

The 2006 film &quot;Apocalypto&quot;, directed by Mel Gibson, was filmed entirely in Yucatec Maya. The script was translated into Maya by Hilario Chi Canul of the Maya community of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who also worked as a language coach on the production.

In the video game &quot;Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings&quot;, Pacal, leader of the Maya, speaks in Yucatec Maya.

In August 2012, the Mozilla Translathon 2012 event brought over 20 Yucatec Mayan speakers together in a localization effort for the Google Endangered Languages Project, the Mozilla browser, and the MediaWiki software used by Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.

&quot;Baktun&quot;, the &quot;first ever Mayan telenovela,&quot; premiered in August 2013.

Jesús Pat Chablé is often credited with being one of the first Maya-language rappers and producers.

In the 2018 video game &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot;, the inhabitants of the game&#x27;s Paititi region speak in Yucatec Maya (while immersion mode is on).

The modern bible edition, the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot; was released in the Maya language in 2019. It&#x27;s distributed without charge, both printed and online editions.

On December 4, 2019, the Congress of Yucatán unanimously approved a measure requiring the teaching of the Maya language in schools in the state.

Yucatec Maya is spoken by the fictional underwater kingdom of Talokan and its king Kukulkan in the 2022 film &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;.

<text>Isaac Earl Featherston (21 March 1813 – 19 June 1876), popularly known as the Little Doctor, was a New Zealand politician, known for his advocacy for the establishment of New Zealand self-government, and the importance of the provincial governments.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and family ===
Featherston was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland on 21 March 1813, to Thomas Featherston and Jane (Earl) Featherston. Although he spent a significant amount of time playing sports, specifically football, as a youngster he was also quite academic and qualified in medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1836. On 10 December 1839, he married Bethia Campbell Scott (1816–1864), a daughter of Andrew Scott, of Edinburgh. 

After working as a physician in Italy and across Europe, he emigrated to New Zealand due to problems with tuberculosis, leaving in December 1840 in hope of a cure in more suitable climate. He arrived in Wellington in May 1841 on the New Zealand Company ship &quot;Olympus&quot; as surgeon-superintendent.

=== Political career ===



In 1845, Featherston became the first editor of the &quot;Wellington Independent&quot;. He served in the first, second, third, and fourth Parliaments. He represented the Wanganui and Rangitikei electorate in the first parliament until he resigned on 9 August 1855, and then represented the City of Wellington electorate in the second, third and fourth parliaments. In 1858, he resigned his seat in Parliament and his Wellington superintendency, apparently wanting to return to England. Instead, he successfully stood for re-election in both positions within months.

Featherston was Colonial Secretary (forerunner to the modern Minister of Internal Affairs) in 1861, and a Minister without Portfolio from 1869 to 1871, having been appointed in both instances by William Fox.

Featherston was also heavily involved in the politics of Wellington Province. He was elected unopposed as the first Superintendent from 1853. He resigned from this post on 23 April 1858. He was re-elected on 28 June 1858 and held the post until 1870. His superintendence oversaw some slow growth in Wellington before in 1865 it became the capital of the colony. From 1871 he was the first Agent-General for the colony in London, the precursor to the High Commissioner.

=== The Taranaki Wars ===
When war broke out in 1860, Featherston criticised the Government&#x27;s handling of events, and lent his influence to tribal peacemaking and keeping much of Wellington Province out of the conflict. During the Second Taranaki War (1863–1866), Featherston raised auxiliaries of Māori, but they refused to fight unless he himself led them. Despite suffering from tuberculosis and at times being unable to sit on his horse, he indeed led them and accompanied Major General Trevor Chute on his west coast campaign and march to Mount Egmont. He led a Māori contingent in several engagements, notably at Otapawa, and later alongside Gustavus von Tempsky. 

This saga gave rise to the Featherston legend: he was described leading his men into battle &quot;in his dressing gown, with a cigar in his mouth, having no weapon whatever with which to defend himself&quot;. He was subsequently awarded the New Zealand Cross for bravery.

=== Wakefield–Featherston duel ===
A duel on 24 March 1847 was fought in Wellington between Colonel William Wakefield and Featherston over a newspaper editorial of Featherston on the New Zealand Company land policy which questioned Wakefield&#x27;s honesty. Featherston fired and missed. Then Wakefield fired into the air, saying he would not shoot a man with seven daughters.

== Legacy ==

In his many escapades Featherston had acquired great &quot;mana&quot;. He also left a political legacy in his eight daughters. They included: Laetitia, who married James Menzies; Kate, who married John Cargill; Frances, who married William FitzGerald (son of James FitzGerald); Alice, who married Sir Charles Johnston; and Octavia, who married Alfred Newman.

He was described as a complex and resolute figure, awed by his peers; yet also quiet with a soft, well-spoken voice, very genial and fond of a joke.

The town of Featherston in the Wairarapa is named after him, as are Featherston Street in Wellington and Featherston Street in Palmerston North.

<text>IBM Systems Director is an element management system (EMS) (sometimes referred to as a &quot;workgroup management system&quot;) first introduced by IBM in 1993 as NetFinity Manager. The software was originally written to run on OS/2 2.0. It has subsequently gone through a number of name changes in the interim. It was changed in 1996 to IBM PC SystemView. Later that same year, it was renamed to TME 10 NetFinity. The following year, it reverted to a slightly altered version of its original name: IBM Netfinity Manager (note the lowercase &#x27;f&#x27;).

In 1999, IBM announced Netfinity Director; a new product based on Tivoli IT Director. It was intended as a replacement for IBM Netfinity Manager. When IBM renamed its Netfinity line of enterprise servers to xSeries, the name was changed to IBM Director.

With the release of version 6.1, the product was renamed from IBM Director to IBM Systems Director.

IBM Director consists of 3 components: an agent, a console and a server. To take full advantage of IBM Director&#x27;s capabilities, the IBM Director Agent must be installed on the monitored system. Inventory and management data are stored in an SQL database (Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2 Universal Database or PostgreSQL) which can be separate or on the same server where IBM Director Server resides. Smaller deployments can also utilize Microsoft Jet or MSDE. The server is configured and managed using the IBM Director Console from any Linux or Microsoft Windows workstation.

IBM Systems Director has been removed from marketing and is scheduled to reach end of service in April 2018.

<text>The uvea (; derived from meaning &quot;grape&quot;), also called the uveal layer, uveal coat, uveal tract, vascular tunic or vascular layer, is the pigmented middle layer of the three concentric layers that make up an eye, precisely between the inner retina and the outer fibrous layer composed of the sclera and cornea.

== History and etymology ==

The originally medieval Latin term comes from the Latin word &quot;uva&quot; (&quot;grape&quot;) and is a reference to its grape-like appearance (reddish-blue or almost black colour, wrinkled appearance and grape-like size and shape when stripped intact from a cadaveric eye). In fact, it is a partial loan translation of the Ancient Greek term for the choroid, which literally means “covering resembling a grape”. Its use as a technical term for part of the eye is ancient, but it only referred to the choroid in Middle English and before.

==Structure==

===Regions===
The uvea is the vascular middle layer of the eye. It is traditionally divided into three areas, from front to back:
* Iris
* Ciliary body
* Choroid

==Function==
The prime functions of the uveal tract as a unit are:
* Nutrition and gas exchange: uveal vessels directly perfuse the ciliary body and iris, to support their metabolic needs, and indirectly supply diffusible nutrients to the outer retina, sclera, and lens, which lack any intrinsic blood supply. (The cornea has no adjacent blood vessels and is oxygenated by direct gas exchange with the environment.)
* Light absorption: the uvea improves the contrast of the retinal image by reducing reflected light within the eye (analogous to the black paint inside a camera), and also absorbs outside light transmitted through the sclera, which is not fully opaque.

In addition, some uveal regions have special functions of great importance, including secretion of the aqueous humour by the ciliary processes, control of accommodation (focus) by the ciliary body, and optimisation of retinal illumination by the iris&#x27;s control over the pupil. Many of these functions are under the control of the autonomic nervous system.

==Pharmacology==
The pupil provides a visible example of the neural feedback control in the body. This is subserved by a balance between the antagonistic sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Informal pharmacological experiments have been performed on the pupil for centuries, since the pupil is readily visible, and its size can be readily altered by applying drugs—even crude plant extracts—to the cornea. Pharmacological control over pupil size remains an important part of the treatment of some ocular diseases.

Drugs can also reduce the metabolically active process of secreting aqueous humour, which is important in treating both acute and chronic glaucoma.

==Immunology==
The normal uvea consists of immune competent cells, particularly lymphocytes, and is prone to respond to inflammation by developing lymphocytic infiltrates. A rare disease called sympathetic ophthalmia may represent &#x27;cross-reaction&#x27; between the uveal and retinal antigens (i.e., the body&#x27;s inability to distinguish between them, with resulting misdirected inflammatory reactions).

==Clinical significance==
See uveitis, choroiditis, iritis, iridocyclitis, anterior uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmia, and uveal melanoma.

<doc id="974412" wikidata="Q35719" url="?curid=974412" title="Griko language">
<text>Griko (endonym: /), sometimes spelled Grico, is one of the two dialects of Italiot Greek (the other being Calabrian Greek or ), spoken by Griko people in Salento, province of Lecce, Italy. Some Greek linguists consider it to be a Modern Greek dialect and often call it () or (). Griko and Standard Modern Greek are partially mutually intelligible.

==Classification==
The most popular hypothesis on the origin of Griko is the one by Gerhard Rohlfs and Georgios Hatzidakis, that Griko&#x27;s roots go as far back in history as the time of the ancient Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily in the eighth century BC. The Southern Italian dialect is thus considered to be the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.

There are, however, competing hypotheses according to which Griko may have preserved some Doric elements, but its structure is otherwise mostly based on Koine Greek, like almost all other Modern Greek dialects. Thus, Griko should rather be described as a Doric-influenced descendant of Medieval Greek spoken by those who fled the Byzantine Empire to Italy to escape the Turks. The idea of Southern Italy&#x27;s Greek dialects being historically derived from Medieval Greek was proposed for the first time in the 19th century by Giuseppe Morosi.

==Geographic distribution==

Two small Italiot Greek-speaking communities survive today in the Italian regions of Calabria (Metropolitan city of Reggio Calabria) and Apulia (Province of Lecce). The Italiot Greek-speaking area of Apulia comprises nine small towns in the Grecìa Salentina region (Calimera, Martano, Castrignano de&#x27; Greci, Corigliano d&#x27;Otranto, Melpignano, Soleto, Sternatia, Zollino, Martignano), with a total of 40,000 inhabitants. The Calabrian Greek region also consists of nine villages in Bovesia, (including Bova Superiore, Roghudi, Gallicianò, Chorìo di Roghudi and Bova Marina) and four districts in the city of Reggio Calabria, but its population is significantly smaller, with around only 2000 inhabitants.

==Official status==
By Law 482 of 1999, the Italian parliament recognized the Griko communities of Reggio Calabria and Salento as a Greek ethnic and linguistic minority. It states that the Republic protects the language and culture of its Albanian, Catalan, Germanic, Greek, Slovene and Croat populations and of those who speak French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian. According to UNESCO data from 2011, the two dialects of Griko are classified as severely endangered languages.

==Culture==
There is rich oral tradition and Griko folklore. Griko songs, music and poetry are particularly popular in Italy and Greece. Famous music groups from Salento include Ghetonia, Aramirè, and Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino. Also, influential Greek artists such as Dionysis Savvopoulos and Maria Farantouri have performed in Griko. The Greek musical ensemble Encardia focuses on Griko songs as well as on the musical tradition of Southern Italy at large.

===Samples===
Sample text from – (&quot;Good night&quot;) and , popular Griko songs:

== Phonology ==
* Nasal+stop clusters [ᵐb, ⁿd, ᵑɡ] along with voiceless equivalents [ᵐp, ⁿt, ᵑk] also are heard.
* The cacuminal /ɖ/ may also be realized as an affricate [ɖːʐ], and consonant sequences /tr/ and /tːr/ may be pronounced as [ʈʂ] and [ʈːʂ] among speakers.
* [z] is heard as a realization of /s/ when before a voiced consonant.
* A few cases of a palatal lateral [ʎ] can be heard, possibly as a result of the influence of Standard Italian.

* Vowels /i, u/ are heard as homorganic glides [j, w] when following consonants and preceding other vowels.

== Grammar ==
In many aspects, its grammar is similar to that of Modern Greek. The language has three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. All nouns and adjectives are declined according to number and case. There are four cases, just like in Modern Greek: nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative. Verbs are conjugated according to person, number, tense, mood, and aspect.

<text>Raj Bhavan (translation: &quot;Government House&quot;) is the official residence of the governor of Telangana located in the city of Hyderabad, India. It is located at Somajiguda adjacent to Hussain Sagar lake.

==History==
It was designed and constructed in 1936 by Eric Marrett and Zain Yar Jung, during the reign of the last Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan. The land area is about 21.50 acres (8.4 hectares).

The Nizam&#x27;s Government acquired this estate of Nawab Shahzore Jung and Sayyad Akil Bilgrami for the official residence of the Prime Minister of the princely state of Hyderabad. The estate consisted of two older buildings at the place where the present Durbar Hall is located. These were pulled down to make room for the subsequent new structures.

The earliest occupant of the Durbar Hall building was Sir Akbar Hydari, the Prime Minister of Hyderabad State from 1936 to 1941. But he stayed here for a short period and shifted his residence to an adjacent building which is now known as Dilkusha Guest House.

Subsequent Prime Ministers to stay here were the Nawab of Chattari (1941-1946 and May–November 1947), Sir Mirza Ismail (August 1946 to May 1947), Sir Mehdi Yar Jung (November–December 1947) and Mir Laik Ali, President of the Council of Interim Government (1947–48).

==Shah Manzil==
Shah Manzil, one of the pre-1914 building in Raj bhavan estate, is an architectural landmark and currently used as the office of the Advisors to the Governor of Telangana.

<text>Samuel Zemurray (born Schmuel Zmurri; January 18, 1877 – November 30, 1961), nicknamed &quot;Sam the Banana Man&quot;, was an American businessman who made his fortune in the banana trade. He founded the Cuyamel Fruit Company and later became president of the United Fruit Company, the world&#x27;s most influential fruit company at the time. Both companies were powerful and had influential roles in the politics of Central American countries.

==Early life==
Zemurray&#x27;s birth name was Schmuel Zmurri (, , &quot;Shmuel Davidovich Zmura&quot;). He was born to a poor Jewish family in Kishinev, Bessarabia, Russian Empire (present-day Chişinău, Moldova). His grandfather, Mendel Hirsh of Shargorod, was a Klezmer musician and bandleader. Zemurray grew up on a wheat farm. After his father died, he emigrated to America with his aunt in 1891 at age 14. After landing in New York, he settled in Selma, Alabama, where his uncle owned a general store. Zemurray worked many odd jobs during his youth, being a carpenter&#x27;s assistant, delivery boy, traveling merchant, and housecleaner. Eventually, he saved enough money to bring his siblings from Europe to the United States.

== Career ==
=== Career beginnings ===
Zemurray encountered bananas for the first time in Selma in 1893. At the time, bananas were considered a new and exotic delicacy in the United States, and the industry was growing quickly. Zemurray went to the port of Mobile, Alabama, in 1895 to enter the banana trade. Because bananas ripen quickly, the banana trade relied on the ability to quickly bring the produce to market. In Mobile, Zemurray specialized in buying cheap bananas in danger of being overripe and quickly transporting and selling them in the surrounding region by rail. Starting with only $150, he had saved $100,000 by age 21. His success earned him the nickname &quot;Sam the Banana Man&quot;.

In 1903, Zemurray signed a contract with United Fruit, the dominant company in the banana trade. Along with his partner, Ashbell Hubbard, the newly-formed Hubbard-Zemurray Company would buy and distribute United Fruit&#x27;s ripest bananas. United Fruit itself bought a portion of Hubbard-Zemurray. In 1905, Zemurray moved to New Orleans and the company acquired Thatcher Brothers Steamship Company. They also acquired the Cuyamel Fruit Company and started using that name for the company. At this time, the company imported bananas from Central American farmers, but did not grow bananas of their own.

In 1910, Zemurray bought 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land along the Cuyamel River in Honduras, near the town of Omoa. He then continued to borrow money and buy more lowland forest land in Honduras, well-suited for growing bananas. He developed this land by adding plantations, railroads, and bridges. The work was done largely by Jamaican workers, but Zemurray also liked to participate in the physical labor of the fields. At this point, Hubbard believed that Cuyamel Fruit Company&#x27;s debts had grown too large, and Zemurray bought his share of the business.

=== Honduran coup ===

Zemurray had increased the efficiency of his business through bribery and special deals with the Honduran government. But in 1910, the government of Honduras was working to reschedule their sovereign debt owed to the United Kingdom. United States Secretary of State Philander C. Knox facilitated the negotiations, which would place agents of bankers J.P. Morgan and Company in the country&#x27;s customs offices to collect the taxes needed to repay the debt. Zemurray feared that the enforcement of these taxes would ruin his business, and he lobbied Knox to make the deal more favorable to him.

Knox made no concessions for Zemurray, and told him not to meddle in Honduran affairs. In spite of this instruction, Zemurray devised a plan to overthrow Honduran president Miguel Dávila in order to prevent the deal. He recruited mercenary Lee Christmas, who in turn recruited a force of about 100 other mercenaries in New Orleans, including famed Jewish soldier Sam Dreben. They sailed to Honduras in a former United States Navy vessel, where they began a war to install exiled Honduran former president Manuel Bonilla, who had been living in New Orleans. Gaining rebel soldiers from the local population, the coup was successful, and Bonilla was inaugurated on February 1, 1912. He then rewarded Zemurray with very favorable tax and land concessions for Cuyamel Fruit Company.

=== Sale of Cuyamel and first retirement ===
In 1913, Zemurray bought back the portion of his company owned by United Fruit, a transaction that was made possible by increasing anti-trust pressure on United Fruit from the United States government. Fully in control of the company, he expanded by buying 20 ships by 1915 that were outfitted with refrigerated holds. Cuyamel Fruit began to cultivate crops beyond bananas: coconuts, pineapples, palm oil, cattle, lumber, and sugarcane.

During the 1910&#x27;s and 1920&#x27;s, Zemurray continuously conflicted with United Fruit. Their competition over land in Central America included pranks, sabotage, legal challenges, and approached outright violence. In 1928, a Cuyamel Fruit boat was discovered with a cache of weapons aboard. In 1929, the United States Department of State facilitated discussions between Zemurray and United Fruit to merge their companies and end the conflict, which was endangering American interests abroad. A deal was completed in 1929, in which Zemurray sold Cuyamel to United Fruit for $31.5 million in stock, making him one of the richest people in the United States. Though Zemurray had prided himself on independence, he sold his company because of increasing pressure from the Department of State and because of the financial insecurity brought on by the Great Depression in 1929.

 As part of the deal with United Fruit, Zemurray agreed to retire from the banana business entirely, to make sure he would not start a new fruit company and continue to compete with United Fruit. During this two year period, Zemurray remodeled his ornate Beaux Arts mansion in New Orleans at 2 Audubon Place. He also acquired in 1928 Houltonwood, a 25,000-acre plantation located near Hammond, Louisiana, which became a favorite retreat of Zemurray for the rest of his life. United Fruit suffered financially because of mismanagement and the Great Depression, so much so that its stock declined in value by 90% after it acquired Cuyamel. This encouraged Zemurray to return to the banana business by buying a controlling share of United Fruit and voting out the board of directors. Zemurray reorganized the company, decentralized decision-making and made the company profitable once more.

=== Leading United Fruit Company ===
After the sale of Cuyamel, United Fruit&#x27;s business declined because of the impact of the Great Depression. In Zemurray&#x27;s view, the company could be managed better to handle the economic downturn. Though he sent a letter and attended a board meeting, United Fruit&#x27;s management was not interested in his ideas. Zemurray then visited individual United Fruit shareholders and collected their proxies, which would enable him to gain control of the company. He then attended a United Fruit board meeting, in which he produced the proxies, dramatically saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve been fucking up this business long enough. I&#x27;m going to straighten it out.&quot;

Now as president of United Fruit Company, Zemurray succeeded in improving business. He considered his hands-on approach of visiting banana plantations to be the key to his success. He gained a detailed understanding of operations, resulting in mass terminations of weak employees, improved efficiency in the use of ships, and new financial approaches.

Partially as a result of banana diseases Sigatoka and Panama disease, Zemurray presided over very large acquisitions of land in Central America. Because the diseases were not curable, United Fruit would simply move to a new area of land after previous ones became infected. In this way, United Fruit came to own the majority of private land in countries like Honduras, even though much of it was left uncultivated.

=== Guatemalan coup ===
In 1953, the U.S. State Department and United Fruit embarked on a major public relations campaign to convince the American people and the rest of the U.S. government that Colonel Jacobo Arbenz intended to make Guatemala a Soviet &quot;satellite&quot;. Zemurray authorized Edward Bernays to launch a propaganda campaign against Col. Arbenz&#x27;s democratically elected government, which intended to expropriate some of the unused land owned by the United Fruit Co. and redistribute it to the local peasants. In 1954, the campaign succeeded and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency helped orchestrate a coup that replaced Arbenz with a military junta led by Col. Carlos Castillo Armas.

Zemurray retired as president of United Fruit in late 1951. He and his family made generous donations to Tulane University (including a large collection of Mayan artifacts discovered in banana fields), the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School, and to other philanthropic ventures, including the Zionist movement through his personal acquaintance, beginning in the 1920s, with Chaim Weizmann. Zemurray supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, helping to draft the Agricultural Adjustment Administration industry codes, and contributed financially to left-wing causes, such as &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine.

== Innovations ==
Zemurray and his company developed several innovations in banana farming, which contributed toward Cuyamel Fruit Company&#x27;s increased efficiency over United Fruit.

* Selective pruning: removing the smallest and weakest banana plants.
* Drainage: adding spillways and canals to drain excess water away from plants.
* Silting: some fields were allowed to be flooded, which helped fertilize them with silt.
* Staking: banana plants were attached to a bamboo shoot, helping prevent them from blowing over in the wind.
* Overhead irrigation: sprinklers were added to banana fields so that plants received water year-round.

== Personal life ==
Zemurray married Sarah Weinberger in May 1908. Weinberger was the daughter of Jake Weinberger, an early figure in the banana trade and employee of Zemurray&#x27;s. Weinberger published a cookbook titled &quot;One Hundred Unusual Dinners and How to Prepare Them&quot;. Their daughter, archaeologist Doris Zemurray Stone, was born in 1909. Their son, Samuel Jr., was born in 1913. He went missing in action as a pilot in World War II, leaving a widow and two children. In 1945, Zemurray and Coryell McKinney donated of land in Hammond, Louisiana, for a memorial park to honor Samuel Jr. and his flight crew. The site is now part of the city&#x27;s Zemurray Park.

Zemurray became a philanthropic and gave thousands of dollars to Tulane University, Radcliffe College, &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, and to clinics and hospitals in New Orleans. In Central America, he funded hospitals, roads, infrastructure, and schools, including the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School.

Zemurray was a member of Temple Sinai in New Orleans.

<doc id="974449" wikidata="Q5516988" url="?curid=974449" title="Gaianism">
<text>Gaianism is an earth-centered philosophical, holistic, and spiritual belief that shares expressions with earth religions and paganism while not identifying exclusively with any specific one. The term describes a philosophy and ethical worldview which, though not necessarily religious, implies a transpersonal devotion to earth as a superorganism. Practitioners of Gaianism are called Gaians (or Gaianists).

Marcel Wissenburg has described Gaianism as a &quot;modern variant of philosophical determinism&quot;. Gaianism has been associated with the New Age movement due to sharing similar viewpoints, but is not typically identified as strictly part of the New Age movement as a whole.

Gaianism&#x27;s philosophy stems from James Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis, which proposes that organisms interact with their surroundings on Earth to form a more complex and self-regulating system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life on the planet. Gaia can be understood as a superorganism made of organisms, as multicellular life can be understood as a superorganism at a smaller level of scale.

Practitioners of Gaianism are termed &quot;Gaians&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Gaianists&quot;. Followers typically approach the philosophy with the perspective that people should honor the Earth, reduce or soften their human impact on the earth, and respect all life on earth. The latter perspective is extended to all forms of life such as plant, animal, or human, and followers will often try to maintain a close relationship with the planet in order to strive toward world peace, maintain global homeostasis and find inner fulfillment. Gaians will occasionally follow Gaianism along with other religions, but for many Gaianism is not necessarily religious. 

An example of Gaian philosophy is the Gaian Oath, envisioned by Lucian Tarnowski, founder of the United Planet:
We are a United Planet

I am Gaian

On my honour, I commit to a thriving civilisation in harmony with all life.Although Gaianism is an Earth-centered belief system, it does not always align with environmental goals. For instance, the chief scientific originator of Gaianism, James Lovelock, advocated a vast expansion of nuclear energy power plants on Earth, the colonization of other planets, and a tolerance of various earthly chemical pollutants.

<doc id="974464" wikidata="Q14685793" url="?curid=974464" title="Tybouts Corner, Delaware">
<text>Tybouts Corner is an unincorporated populated place in New Castle County, Delaware, United States.

==Geography==
Tybouts Corner is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 13 and Hamburg Road/Bear Tybouts Road just north of an interchange with Delaware Route 1 and an intersection with the northern terminus of Delaware Route 71. Tybouts Corner and has an elevation of .

==History==
Tybouts Corner is named after George Z. Tybout, a local landowner and agricultural pioneer in the 19th century. His daughter, Ella Tybout, became a noted magazine writer.

The Tybouts Corner landfill opened in 1968. It was initially used only for household waste, but soon industrial waste was deposited there as well, violating state regulations. Fires burned about once a month at the site. The landfill closed in 1971, when it was filled to capacity. In 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency filed suit against New Castle County for its mismanagement of the waste disposal. The EPA listed the former landfill as the second-most hazardous in the country in 1982. It was listed as a Superfund site in 1985.

The Stauffer Chemical Company accidentally contaminated drinking water wells in Tybouts Corner with chemical wastes at its plant in the 1970s. Jacob Wagner, who owned a home that bordered the landfill, had yellow water in their well, and he subsequently sued the county. The heavy soil in the area helped limit the spread of pollution. The plant was purchased by Formosa Plastics Corporation in 1981. In 1985, residents were concerned after an environmental group charged Formosa with releasing vinyl chloride emissions. Scientists suggested that it could have poisoned their water. As a result, the wells were closed and residents had their drinking water piped in.

A gas tanker with 8,400 gallons of gasoline overturned on U.S. Route 13 in Tybouts Corner in February 1986. It possibly hit a patch of ice and spun out of control. Though no fire was reported, police mandated the evacuation of 30 houses in the area.

A temporary gas venting system was installed in 1996. A permanent gas venting system was built in 2000. These systems prevent underground landfill gas from extending beyond the landfill property boundary. In May 2007, the groundwater was considered to have greatly reduced its contents of contaminants, so the EPA and Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control shut down the water pumping wells. The following year, quarterly monitoring of the groundwater ended and it has been monitored twice yearly since then.

<doc id="974466" wikidata="Q6309020" url="?curid=974466" title="Juliette Powell">
<text>Juliette Powell is an American-Canadian media expert, tech ethicist, business advisor, author and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Canada 1989, the contest&#x27;s first Black Canadian winner. 

==Early life==
Powell was born in Manhattan, New York in 1971 and moved to Montreal, Quebec with her French-Canadian mother at the age of eight. In high school she excelled in math and science courses and swam twice a week, and has stated she saw herself as a shy and unpopular student.

Her time in the world of beauty pageants began with her outrage when she heard a rumour that the second place winner of the Miss Montreal pageant had scored higher than the first-place winner, but the judges had not accepted her as the winner because she was black. She has stated that she did not want to be a beauty queen but wanted to prove a point when she entered the Miss Montreal pageant herself, later entering and ultimately winning the 1989 Miss Canada Pageant. During this time she also studied Commerce at Vanier College, graduating in 1992. 

==Career==
After her reign as Miss Canada, including representing the country at Miss Universe 1989, Powell joined MusiquePlus in 1992 as a VJ, while also studying finance and business at McGill University. She was host of MusiquePlus&#x27; weekly dance music show, &quot;Bouge de là!&quot; until 1996. That same year, she moved to Toronto, transferring to MuchMusic and becoming host of &quot;Electric Circus&quot; and &quot;French Kiss&quot;, while also studying economics at the University of Toronto.

In 1999, Powell began working for CablePulse 24 as a business reporter and founded media and consulting company Powell International Entertainment Inc. (PIE Inc.) which produced features with personalities such as Nelson Mandela, Rubin &#x27;Hurricane&#x27; Carter, Sir Richard Branson, Tim Burton, Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Janet Jackson, Tina Turner, and Prince Charles.

In 2001, she co-authored the media section for the UN Plan of Action of the World Conference against Racism. This began an ongoing advisory role with international institutions that grew to include the United Nations, World Economic Forum, and the World Bank, among others. In 2011, she began working with the E-G8, an extension of the G8 Summit, created to inform G8 leaders on the future of the internet and connected society. 

Powell&#x27;s writing first gained notoriety with her 2009 book &quot;33 Million People in the Room: How to Create, Influence and Run a Successful Business using Social Networking&quot; (Financial Times Press, ). Her early publications on the business applications of social media were translated into Chinese, Korean, German, Portuguese and Spanish. 

Powell&#x27;s live commentary on NBC, CNN, ABC, BBC, BNN and combined TV appearances and columns for Bloomberg raised business and ethical issues stemming from social media, including privacy, cybersecurity, and bias. She became a frequent keynote speaker and media collaborator examining the implications of big data. In 2016 Powell gave a TED Talk on Unconscious Bias at TEDx St Louis Women&#x27;s event titled It&#x27;s About Time We Challenge Our Unconscious Biases. 

Powell later translated her Canadian degree into a US-recognized degree, graduating from Columbia University &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Phi Beta Kappa membership. Her thesis research, “The Limits and Possibilities in the Self-Regulation of Artificial Intelligence,” drew on her consulting for Intel Labs and other multinational companies and later served as the foundation of her book &quot;The AI Dilema&quot;. 

In 2021 Juliette joined the Faculty of New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, teaching courses at the intersection of media, technology, and ethics.

<text>Cornstalk ( – November 10, 1777) was a Shawnee leader in the Ohio Country in the 1760s and 1770s. His name in the Shawnee language was Hokoleskwa. Little is known about his early life. He may have been born in the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1763, he reportedly led a raid against British American colonists in Pontiac&#x27;s War. He first appears in historical documents in 1764, when he was one of the hostages surrendered to the British as part of the peace negotiations ending Pontiac&#x27;s War.

When the British American colonies began expanding into the Ohio Country, Cornstalk played a major part in defense of the Shawnee homeland. He was the primary Shawnee war chief in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War (1774), leading Shawnees and other Native warriors against colonists in the Battle of Point Pleasant. After suffering defeat in that battle, he became an advocate for Shawnee neutrality in the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775. Many Shawnees fought against the Americans, hoping to regain lost lands, but Cornstalk was among those who feared that fighting the Americans would prove disastrous for the Shawnees.

In 1777, Cornstalk made a diplomatic visit to Fort Randolph in Virginia (now West Virginia), hoping to learn American intentions. He and three others were imprisoned by the fort&#x27;s commander. When an American militiaman was killed by Natives in the fort&#x27;s vicinity, angry soldiers executed Cornstalk and the other prisoners. His murder enraged Shawnees and deprived them of an important voice of moderation.

==Biography==
===Background and early life===
Little is known of Cornstalk&#x27;s early life, as he does not clearly appear in historical records until 1764. His year of birth is unknown; some early writings estimate it at 1720, although this date is undocumented. His name in the Shawnee language, Hokoleskwa (&quot;a blade of corn&quot;), was also recorded in colonial records as Colesqua, Keightughqua, and Semachquaan, with several spelling variations.

In the 1680s, decades before Cornstalk&#x27;s birth, the Shawnees were driven out of the Ohio Country by the Iroquois. One Shawnee band resettled in the Wyoming Valley along the Susquehanna River in the Province of Pennsylvania, near present-day Plymouth. A leader of this group was Paxinosa, a noted Shawnee chief. Moravian missionaries who knew Cornstalk said he was Paxinosa&#x27;s son or grandson, so Cornstalk might have been born in that area. Shawnees of Cornstalk&#x27;s era belonged to one of five tribal divisions: Mekoche, Chalahgawtha (Chillicothe), Kispoko, Pekowi, and Hathawekela. Like Paxinosa, Cornstalk belonged to the Mekoche division.

When fighting in the French and Indian War came to Pennsylvania in 1755, Paxinosa&#x27;s band remained neutral. In 1758, seeking to avoid the conflict, they relocated to the Ohio Country, establishing a new town, Wakatomika, on the Muskingum River, with other Shawnee refugees. Some Ohio Shawnees took part in the war. Many years later, Cornstalk was said to have led a 1759 raid into Virginia, although stories about his participation in that raid may be apocryphal. Cornstalk may have fought in Pontiac&#x27;s War (1763–1766), a pan-tribal effort to counter British control of the Ohio Country. He is said to have led a 1763 raiding party into Virginia (now West Virginia). He first appears in historical records in 1764, when he took part in negotiations with Colonel Henry Bouquet. He was one of the hostages surrendered by the tribe to ensure compliance with the peace. Fearful for his safety, Cornstalk escaped and returned home.

The Ohio Shawnees had initially been concentrated in two major towns, Wakatomica on the Muskingum and Lower Shawneetown on the Ohio River. In 1758, Lower Shawneetown was abandoned in favor of multiple, smaller towns up the Scioto River. In the 1760s, Cornstalk established his own town on the Scioto, as did his sister, Nonhelema, known to colonists as the &quot;Grenadier Squaw.&quot; Cornstalk&#x27;s brothers Nimwha and Silver Heels were also notable Shawnee leaders. Cornstalk had at least two children, sons Cutemwha (The Wolf) and Allanawissica (also called Elinipsico). In the 1780s, Cutemwha (also known as Piaseka or Biaseka), would emerge an important Shawnee chief.

===Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War===
During Pontiac&#x27;s War, the British issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which created a boundary between the British colonies and Native land in the west. This boundary did not last long: in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, Sir William Johnson negotiated a new boundary line with the Iroquois, ceding lands south of the Ohio River (present-day West Virginia and Kentucky) to the British. Although Shawnees used this land for hunting, they had not been consulted in the negotiations. Clashes between settlers and Indians erupted after 1769 as settlers and land speculators poured into the region. Shawnees began organizing other Natives in an effort to defend their hunting grounds against British colonization. In 1773, Cornstalk warned Thomas Bullitt against surveying the region.

The issue became a crisis in 1774 after at least ten Mingo Indians were murdered by white settlers in the Yellow Creek massacre. Mingos retaliated against settlers, and war seemed imminent. At Fort Pitt, John Connolly, agent for Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, called out the militia. Cornstalk worked to prevent the escalation of violence. He sent his brother Silver Heels to escort several British traders from the Shawnee towns to safety in Fort Pitt. While at Fort Pitt, Silver Heels was shot and seriously wounded by local militiamen. Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War had begun.

Cornstalk was not the principal chief of the Shawnees, as is sometimes thought. Shawnees lived in autonomous towns with no central government, but in the 1760s they began appointing a ceremonial leader (or &quot;principal chief&quot;) from the Mekoche division to speak for them in negotiations with colonial leaders. The principal chief in Cornstalk&#x27;s day was the Mekoche Chief Kisinoutha (Hard Man). According to Shawnee custom, in time of war, civil chiefs like Kisinoutha yielded leadership to their war chiefs. Now Cornstalk, as head warrior, took command, leading war chiefs that included Blue Jacket, Black Snake (Peteusha), and Pukeshinwau.

The Shawnees and Mingos were greatly outnumbered by the Virginians, so Cornstalk tried to recruit Native allies in the face of an imminent invasion. British officials successfully prevented other Indians from joining the war, leaving Cornstalk with only about 300 Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot warriors to oppose Dunmore&#x27;s 2,300 men. Dunmore launched a two-prong invasion of the Ohio Country, with him leading one wing, Colonel Andrew Lewis in command of the other. Cornstalk decided to strike at Lewis&#x27;s wing before the two armies could unite, initiating the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10. During the intense, day-long battle, Virginians heard Cornstalk encouraging his men to &quot;be strong, be strong!&quot; The Shawnees initially had the upper hand, but when colonial reinforcements arrived, the outnumbered Shawnees were pushed back. Near sundown, Cornstalk finally withdrew his warriors across the Ohio River.

As Dunmore&#x27;s armies continued to advance into the Ohio Country, some warriors wished to continue fighting. Cornstalk chastised them, saying, &quot;then let us kill all our women and children, and go fight till we die.&quot; Cornstalk arranged to meet Dunmore and negotiate an end to the brief war. At the Treaty of Camp Charlotte, Cornstalk apparently accepted the Ohio River as the boundary of Shawnee lands. He surrendered four hostages, including his son, to ensure compliance with the terms. A Virginia officer, Col. Benjamin Wilson, wrote of Cornstalk&#x27;s speech to Lord Dunmore at Camp Charlotte: &quot;I have heard the first orators in Virginia, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, but never have I heard one whose powers of delivery surpassed those of Cornstalk on that occasion.&quot;

===American Revolution===
When the American Revolutionary War followed shortly after Dunmore&#x27;s War, Cornstalk endeavored to keep his people neutral. In October 1775, Cornstalk, Nimwha, and other Mekoches represented the Shawnees in 1775 at a council held at Fort Pitt, seeking to maintain peaceful relations with the Americans.

In the summer of 1776, he also visited the British in Detroit, hoping to establish friendly relations with them as well. Many Shawnees, nevertheless, hoped to use British aid to reclaim their lands lost to the Americans. Shawnees sent emissaries south to the Cherokees at Chota (present Tennessee) to seek aid. A young Cherokee chief, Dragging Canoe, accepted the call to arms. Shawnees and Cherokees began cooperating in a war against the Americans.

In the autumn of 1776, Cornstalk returned to Fort Pitt, where he told U.S. Indian agent George Morgan that although some young Shawnee warriors were acting rashly, his people were committed to peace. Cornstalk had Morgan send a message to the Continental Congress, outlining Shawnee grievances and offering friendship. In the meantime, Cornstalk said he had decided to remove his followers to Coshocton, a neutral Delaware Indian town on the Tuscarawas River. By the winter of 1776, Shawnees were effectively divided between Cornstalk&#x27;s neutral faction and militant bands led by such men as Blackfish. Although Cornstalk, Kisinoutha and other Mekoche leaders had made peace with the Virginians at Camp Charlotte, the other Shawnee divisions did not all agree with the loss of their hunting grounds and pursued their own agendas.

In October 1777, two Shawnees visited Fort Randolph, an American fort that had been built at the site of the Battle of Point Pleasant (present-day Point Pleasant, West Virginia). They were detained by the fort&#x27;s commander, Matthew Arbuckle, who had decided to hold hostage any Shawnees who fell into his hands. Cornstalk&#x27;s son Elinipsico (Allanawissica) arrived a few days later to ask why they were being held. Cornstalk came to the fort soon after, and all four were detained. On November 10, an American militiaman stationed at the fort was killed by unknown Indians in the vicinity. In retaliation, angry soldiers brutally executed Cornstalk, Elinipsico, and the other two Shawnees.

===Aftermath of murder===
According to historian John Sudgen, &quot;The significance of Cornstalk&#x27;s death has been misinterpreted.&quot; Cornstalk&#x27;s murder did not cause the Shawnees to go to war against the Americans, as is sometimes believed, since militant Shawnees had already decided to do so. However, his death deprived the Shawnees of an important voice of moderation and convinced many Indians that Americans could not be trusted. More Shawnees joined the ranks of the militants after the murder. Cornstalk&#x27;s followers relocated to Coshocton in 1778. His sister Nonhelema moved to Fort Randolph, where she worked as an interpreter and messenger for the Americans, and continued to promote peace despite her brother&#x27;s murder.

American political and military leaders were alarmed by Cornstalk&#x27;s murder; they believed he was their only hope of securing Shawnee neutrality. Patrick Henry, the first governor of Virginia under the United States, was outraged, demanding that Cornstalk&#x27;s &quot;vile assassins&quot; be brought to justice. 

They were &quot;James Hall of the county of Rockbridge, and Malcolm McCown of Augusta, Adam Barnes of Greenbrier, William Roane of Rockbridge and Hugh Galbreath of Rockbridge... for James Hall 200 dollars, for Malcolm McCown 150 dollars, for Adam Barnes, William Roane and Hugh Galbreath 100 dollars each.&quot; The alleged killers were eventually brought to trial, but since their fellow soldiers would not testify against them, all were acquitted.

==Legacy==
Cornstalk was originally buried at Fort Randolph. In 1840, his grave was rediscovered and his remains were moved to the Mason County Courthouse grounds. When the courthouse was torn down in 1954, Cornstalk was reburied at Tu-Endie-Wei State Park, the site of the Battle of Point Pleasant. Local legends arose about his dying &quot;curse&quot; being the cause of misfortunes in the area. Regional stories claim that he took his revenge in the 1960s by sending the mysterious Mothman to terrorize Point Pleasant.

A legend about Aracoma, a supposed daughter of Cornstalk, is well known in Logan County, West Virginia. The story is presented as an outdoor drama each year at Chief Logan State Park. The city of Logan, West Virginia, was known as &quot;Aracoma&quot; from about 1844 to 1907, and was named after her.

<text>The Matthews (or Mathews) Range, also known as the Lenkiyio Hills, is a range of mountains in Kenya.

==Geography==
The range is about 150 km long, oriented north–south. It is located in the Laikipia district of the Rift Valley Province in northern Kenya. The town of Wamba lies at the southeastern edge of the range.
===Peaks===
The highest point is Warges, at above sea level, a peak located the southern end of the range, separated by a valley from the rest of the range. 
There is also a breast-shaped hill locally known as Sweet Sixteen in the range.

===Table===
== Ecology ==
The area is isolated, and holds montane forests of African juniper (&quot;Juniperus procera&quot;) and cycads. It is home to elephants and other large mammals, and was one of the last places in northern Kenya to have wild Black Rhinos. The last Black Rhino in the Mathew&#x27;s was poached out in the 1990s. The Mathew&#x27;s are also home to the Samburu people. The mountain range is a sky island: surrounded by plains, with Ndoto Mountains to the north and the Karisia hills to the west. A number of the species in the Mathew&#x27;s have evolved independently and the diversity of the forest is of great conservation value. Part has been designated as a wildlife sanctuary.

Mathews Range Forest Reserve was established in 1956, and covers an area of 973.92 km2.

In 1995, a Trust was formed by the Samburu tribes to preserve the Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy, which remains one of the most successful community conservation programs in Kenya.

<doc id="974515" wikidata="Q5459231" url="?curid=974515" title="Flight Meteorologist insignia">
<text>The Flight Meteorologist insignia is a military badge decoration of the United States Navy which is issued to officers of the Restricted Line who are commissioned as weather and meteorology specialists. To be issued the insignia, an officer must also have completed flight training to qualify as a Naval Aircrew Member. The insignia itself is very similar to the Naval Aircrew Badge.

Personnel authorized the Flight Meteorologist insignia are most often assigned to aircraft such as the P-3 Orion and engage in weather surveillance and airborne monitoring duties. A more dangerous activity of Flight Meteorologists is known as “hurricane chasing”, where a Navy aircraft will fly into a hurricane in order to gauge wind speed and other environmental measurements.

Navy precedence charts also list the Flight Meteorologist insignia as the Naval Aviation Observer Badge. This previous name dates to the original concept of the badge in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, when the decoration was classified as the Naval Aviation Observer insignia and issued to flight support personnel such as navigators, bombardiers, radar officers, non-Naval Aviator co-pilots, and other officer aircrew. 

In the 1940s, a slightly different version of this insignia was briefly issued with a silver compass rose centered on gold wings. Designated as the Naval Aviation Observer (Navigation) insignia, or simply as Naval Navigator wings, it was issued to Navy aerial navigators between 1945 and 1948. After 1948, Navy aerial navigators returned to wearing the Naval Aviation Observer insignia, although the former Naval Aviation Observer (Navigation) insignia continues to be awarded as the Marine Aerial Navigator insignia and Coast Guard Aerial Navigator insignia to Marine Corps and Coast Guard enlisted navigators in the KC-130 and HC-130 Hercules. 

An insignia similar to that of Flight Meteorologist were Naval Aviation Observer (NAO) wings. NAOs were non-pilot officers in naval aircraft who flew in a variety of roles such as navigator, bombardier, radar intercept officer, tactical coordinator and electronic warfare officer. Distinguishing the NAO insignia was a center device of a silver anchor within a silver circle and it was used by NAOs in both the Navy and Marine Corps from 1929 to 1968. For Navy and Marine Corps aviation officers previously designated as Naval Aviation Observers, these officers were redesignated as Naval Flight Officers in 1966 and their insignia replaced by the current Naval Flight Officer insignia beginning in 1966 and completed by 1968.

In the modern Navy, the Naval Aviation Observer insignia is occasionally issued under its original name but is jointly known as the Flight Meteorologist insignia.

<doc id="974517" wikidata="Q574907" url="?curid=974517" title="McHale's Navy">
<text>McHale&#x27;s Navy is an American sitcom starring Ernest Borgnine that aired 138 half-hour episodes over four seasons, from October 11, 1962, to April 12, 1966, on the ABC television network. The series was filmed in black and white and originated from a one-hour drama titled &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot;, broadcast on April 3, 1962, as part of the &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot; anthology series. The ABC series spawned three feature films: &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1964); a sequel, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot; (1965); and a 1997 sequel-remake of the original series.

==&quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot; (1962)==
Academy Award–winning dramatic actor Ernest Borgnine first appeared as Quinton McHale in an hour-long one-shot drama called &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot;, which aired as an episode of &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot; in 1962, an ABC dramatic anthology also known as &quot;Fred Astaire&#x27;s Premiere Theatre&quot; and hosted by Fred Astaire, who introduced television audiences to the Quinton McHale character. It is considered the pilot show for the series although it is an hour-long drama instead of a half-hour situation comedy and is starkly different in tone.

===Plot===
During World War II, Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale (Borgnine) is the commanding officer of the U.S. Navy PT boat &quot;PT-73&quot;, stationed at the fictional Pacific island base of Taratupa. In the late spring of 1942, the Japanese heavily bomb the island, destroying the base. Only 18 of 150 naval aviators and Marines on the base survive. With Japanese patrols in the region too heavy for a Navy rescue mission, McHale and his men survive by hiding on the island. Assisted by the native tribes whom they befriend, the sailors live a pleasant island existence. After months of leisurely life, strait-laced, by-the-book Annapolis graduate Lieutenant Durham (Ron Foster) parachutes onto the island. His job is to assume duties as McHale&#x27;s executive officer and help him get the base on Taratupa back into action.

Durham faces an uphill battle: the men have . One man has started a native laundry service, and McHale operates a still, making moonshine for the men and the natives. In addition, McHale is friendly with the native chief; the two even bathe in the same room, attended to by one of the chief&#x27;s wives. When Durham informs McHale of his orders, McHale refuses to follow them. It is clear that while McHale is as loyal as any American, following the devastation caused by the Japanese on the island, he is reluctant to risk losing more men. His concern now is for their survival until they can be rescued, which creates friction between Durham and McHale.

When they get word that a Marine battalion is pinned on a beach and an enemy cruiser is planning to attack the beachhead in the morning, McHale&#x27;s attitude changes. McHale is ordered to use all his boats to protect the beachhead and the Marines, but he has no boats, since the Japanese sank them all. However, McHale and his men manage to capture a Japanese PT boat that arrives at the island. Surprising the men and Durham, McHale does not plan to use the boat to evacuate his men or the Marine battalion. Instead, he will attack and destroy the Japanese cruiser. He estimates that since they are on a Japanese boat, flying a Japanese flag, they can move in and torpedo the cruiser twice and send it to the bottom.

With just two torpedoes, McHale, Durham, and a crew set out in darkness aboard the acquired PT boat to find and engage the cruiser. By patrolling the only water deep enough for the cruiser to reach the beach, they spot it about two hours before dawn. McHale pilots the PT boat at maximum speed directly towards the cruiser, allowing the crew to fire both torpedoes, the second of which impacts the bow of the cruiser and causes a very large explosion, implying its destruction. The PT boat is last seen, apparently returning to Taratupa, now flying an American flag.

===Cast===
The cast of &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot; was:

* Ernest Borgnine as Captain Quentin MacHale
* Ron Foster as Lieutenant Robert Durham
* William Bramley as Bosun Ward Gallagher
* Bobby Wright as Willy Moss
* Gary Vinson as Christy Christopher
* Steve Harris as Plumber Harris
* Brian Eliot as Jenkins
* Bob Okazaki as Japanese Officer
* Michael Dugan as Seaman Number One
* Juano Hernandez as Chief Mamora
===Response===
This episode of an early dramatic anthology series received respectable ratings and ABC ordered a series. The series requested by the network was significantly different in tone from the pilot. In an interview in &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; magazine, Borgnine said the show was meant as a vehicle for Ron Foster, who was to be contracted to Universal Pictures, but that did not work out. Producer Jennings Lang recalled the 1953 film &quot;Destination Gobi&quot; inspiring a half-hour comedy with the Borgnine character&#x27;s PT boat. The lead character in &quot;Destination Gobi&quot;, played by Richard Widmark, was named McHale.

&quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot; is available for public viewing at the Paley Center for Media (formerly the Museum of Television and Radio) in New York City and Los Angeles. , it can also be found on YouTube.

==&quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1962–1966)==
This military service comedy series was set in the Pacific theatre of World War II—for the last season, the setting changed to the European theater in Italy—and focused on antics of the misfit crew of &quot;PT-73&quot; led by Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale, played by Borgnine. The producer, Edward Montagne, had enjoyed success with &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;—often referred to as &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;, after the series&#x27; protagonist—a military comedy that ran from 1955 to 1959 about an opportunistic non-commissioned officer and his loyal platoon putting loony things over on the camp commander. While the pilot had been dramatic, with overtones of Henry Fonda&#x27;s introspective &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, Montagne turned the &quot;McHale&quot; project into &quot;Bilko in the Navy&quot; and recruited &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot; actors and writers.

However, unlike &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;, which was set in peacetime, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; was set during World War II, although much of what takes place is, in some ways, as if it were peacetime with the crew permanently stationed in one location and concerned about peacetime duties rather than fighting a war. At the time of the series, then-President John F. Kennedy was known as the wartime commander of &quot;PT-109&quot;. A popular book, &quot;PT 109: John F. Kennedy in WWII&quot; by Robert J. Donovan, came out the previous year and &quot;PT-109&quot; was referenced in the episode &quot;Send Us A Hero&quot;.

===Plot===
The basic plot is that McHale&#x27;s crew schemes to make money, attract women and enjoy themselves, and the efforts of Captain Binghamton (McHale&#x27;s superior) to rid himself of the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew for good, either by transfer or court-martial. Although they often get into trouble, they typically manage to get out of it. Despite their scheming, conniving, and often lazy and unmilitary ways, McHale&#x27;s crew is always successful in combat in the end. This bears close resemblance to the British radio programme &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;, broadcast around the same period.

The first episode, titled &quot;An Ensign for McHale&quot;, sets the tone for the entire series. It involves Ensign Parker&#x27;s assignment to McHale&#x27;s crew after they already had gone through several ensigns who could not put up with their unmilitary, slovenly, and insubordinate ways. One of them even suffered a nervous breakdown. Parker is given one week by Binghamton to reform the crew or be given the worst reassignment possible. At first, the crew treats Parker as badly as they treated the other ensigns, but after McHale sees Parker has integrity, he decides to help Parker out by having his crew be much more like regular Navy.

Sometimes, the crewmen wear disguises to carry out elaborate schemes, such as when McHale needs to stage a phony Japanese attack and several of the crew dress up in Japanese uniforms. At other times, the crew dresses up to look like &quot;native savages&quot;. When a situation calls for a disguise as a woman, one of the crew dresses in drag. When they are in Italy, several of the crewmen disguise themselves in German uniforms.

====Settings====
The entire show is based in only two locations: in the South Pacific at a fictional base called Taratupa, and later in an equally fictional town in Italy called Voltafiore.

The first few episodes merely indicate that Taratupa is &quot;somewhere in the South Pacific 1943.&quot; The implied location (per the first episode) is islands north of New Zealand. While in the South Pacific, McHale&#x27;s crew lives on &quot;McHale&#x27;s Island&quot;, across the bay from Taratupa. It keeps them away from the main base, where they are free to carry out their antics and even fight the war.

The final season has a total change of scenery as Binghamton, Carpenter and the entire &quot;PT-73&quot; crew, along with Fuji (who hid in the boat as it was being transported), move to the liberated Italian theater in &quot;late 1944&quot; to the coastal town of Voltafiore in &quot;Southern Italy&quot;, where Binghamton becomes the military governor and they become members of PT Boat Squadron 19. Moneymaking schemes of the wacky and somewhat crooked Mayor Mario Lugatto (Jay Novello) and the looney antics of the citizens introduce many more plot twists and gags. For instance, when McHale and his crew first arrive in Voltafiore, they are greeted by the newly liberated citizens with cries of &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; While Binghamton and Carpenter live nicely in the city hall, McHale and his men are forced by Binghamton to bivouac in tents near the beach. However, they stumble on an abandoned wine cellar, which becomes their secret underground hideout where they hide Fuji (and of course Binghamton nearly discovers it several times). They later add a submarine-style periscope and fancy furnishings.

===Episodes===

&quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; came to an end in 1966, due to low ratings and repetitive storylines.

===Regular characters===
====Lieutenant Commander McHale====
Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale (Ernest Borgnine) – A principal character of the series, he is also a former captain of a tramp steamer who is familiar with the South Pacific and is especially knowledgeable about the islands and natives around Taratupa, which often helps him in combat situations and makes him a favorite with the admirals. Like his crew, he is unmilitary in many ways, but always a strong and competent leader who is very protective of his crew. Also like his crew, McHale likes to wear Hawaiian-style clothing when off duty and to use the &quot;PT-73&quot; to go deep-sea fishing and water skiing. As Gruber says in the 1964 film, &quot;That&#x27;s no officer, that&#x27;s our skipper&quot;.

Gruff but lovable, he often calls his crew &quot;schlockmeisters&quot; and goofballs. He is called &quot;Skip&quot; by his crew. Although he very often bellows at them and tries to put his foot down, he loves his crew too much to be all that hard on them. McHale&#x27;s catchphrases are &quot;Knock it off, you eight-balls&quot; and when trying to come up with an excuse, a rapid &quot;Well-a, well-a, well-a.&quot; He speaks Japanese, Italian and local island dialects. In the 1964 film, he briefly speaks fluent French. When the crew is in Italy, McHale&#x27;s knowledge of Italian serves him quite well and his mother is Italian (both of Borgnine&#x27;s parents were from Italy). In a dual role, Borgnine played his lookalike Italian cousin, Giuseppe, who does not speak English in &quot;Giuseppe McHale&quot; and &quot;The Return of Giuseppe.&quot;

====Ensign Parker====
Ensign Charles Beaumont Parker (Tim Conway) – McHale&#x27;s likable, but goofy second-in-command, he is referred to by McHale as &quot;Chuck&quot; and by the crew as &quot;Mister Parker&quot; (in the United States Navy, officers ranking from warrant officer to lieutenant commander who are not in command are often referred to as &quot;Mister&quot;). Conway&#x27;s bashful, unassertive, naïve, mildly gung-ho bungler often succeeds in spite of clownish ineptitude (a theme that was career-defining). Like Conway, Ensign Parker is from Chagrin Falls, Ohio. Parker was born between about 1916 and 1920 and worked for the &quot;Chagrin Falls Gazette.&quot;

Although he tries to be military, he is too dimwitted to command too much respect and many of the episodes involve Parker getting into trouble because of his bumbling and ineptitude such as accidentally firing depth charges or shooting down Allied aircraft. Even before becoming a member of McHale&#x27;s crew, Ensign Parker&#x27;s personnel file is a laundry list of major foul-ups, including crashing a destroyer escort into a dock, doing something unspecified in heavy fog to the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and calling in a naval airstrike on a Marine gasoline dump.

Because of his considerable bumbling, the crew tries to protect Parker, who they feel will not survive as an officer without their help. Also, he is very slow to catch on and does not know when to keep his mouth closed. McHale usually gives Parker a discreet kick or stomp on the foot to get him to shut up. For instance, when Binghamton says &quot;the cat is out of the bag,&quot; Parker says, &quot;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s around here somewhere, Sir. Here, kitty, kitty.&quot; Parker&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Gee, I love that kind of talk&quot; and he loves to cite naval regulations which he knows by heart, but somehow can never remember his serial number correctly.

In the episode titled &quot;The Great Impersonation&quot;, Ensign Parker impersonates British General Smythe-Pelly (Conway in a dual role) in Nouméa, New Caledonia, where he dodges assassins while the actual general leads an invasion against Japanese forces. In another Conway dual role, Parker impersonates Admiral Chester &quot;Rockpile&quot; Beaty in &quot;The Seven Faces of Ensign Parker.&quot; In &quot;H.M.S. 73&quot;, Parker poses as a phony British rear admiral, Sir Reggie Grother-Smyth and impersonates British Admiral Clivedon Sommers in &quot;The British Also Have Ensigns.&quot; From time to time, Parker is called upon to fool Captain Binghamton with a voice impersonation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Parker also does an impersonation of Roosevelt in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;).

====Captain Binghamton====
Captain Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Burton Binghamton USNR (Joe Flynn) – McHale&#x27;s perpetually frustrated commanding officer, referred to as &quot;Old Leadbottom&quot; (usually behind his back—a nickname he received from a bullet wound to the posterior). He is a married naval reservist and his job before the war was as the commodore of a yacht club on Long Island and the editor of a yachting magazine. Cantankerous and cross, Binghamton often dreams of a promotion to admiral or occasionally military glory, but is much too inept, cowardly and a bit of a goof himself (early in the series, Binghamton is a rather serious officer, but becomes goofier as the series progresses).

Binghamton comes close to a promotion to Admiral Rogers&#x27; staff in &quot;The Balloon Goes Up&quot;, but because Binghamton took too long in getting things squared away (because of McHale&#x27;s crew), someone else gets the promotion. The one time Binghamton leads the &quot;PT-73&quot; into battle, he only succeeds in &quot;sinking&quot; an enemy truck on land with a torpedo (a gag that was used in the Cary Grant film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;), based on an actual attack conducted by the .

Binghamton is constantly trying to &quot;get the goods&quot; on &quot;McHale and his pirates&quot; to send them to prison or get them transferred and he comes close just about all the time, only to have McHale&#x27;s crew get out of trouble, usually by having some kind of military success, through some form of blackmail (such as telling the admiral what really happened) or because Binghamton wants some kind of a favor from McHale. When he is not complaining about McHale and his crew to his superiors, Binghamton constantly tries to impress superior officers, VIPs or people with connections for personal gain—which usually backfires, making him look foolish.

As a running gag, Binghamton is forever being knocked down (usually by Parker or Carpenter) or covered with something messy (also usually because of Parker). Blind without his glasses, Binghamton also has his glasses knocked or taken off (to keep him from seeing something) a number of times. Occasionally, he is seen throwing darts at a picture of McHale. His catchphrases are: &quot;What in the name of the Blue Pacific&quot; or &quot;What in the name of Nimitz (or Halsey)?&quot; (as when he sees gambling or native dancing girls on McHale&#x27;s Island) and &quot;What is it, wha&#x27;, wha&#x27;, wha&#x27;, what?!&quot; (usually in response to McHale&#x27;s &quot;Well-a, well-a, well-a&quot;).

A running gag has a frustrated Binghamton looking up and saying, &quot;Why me? Why is it always me?&quot; (also used by Tinker in one episode) or &quot;Somebody up there hates me!&quot; His favorite catchphrase is &quot;I could just scream!&quot; which was once used by McHale, Carpenter and even Fuji. The only time Binghamton ever gets even with the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew is in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot; when he orders the crew under the command of Ensign Parker to jump off a dock into the water. In the pilot episode, &quot;An Ensign for McHale&quot;, the sign outside Binghamton&#x27;s office reads &quot;Capt. R.F. Binghamton, U.S.N.R.&quot; even though his name is later established to be Wallace Burton Binghamton.

In &quot;McHale the Desk Commando&quot;, McHale learns what a tough job Binghamton has when he replaces Binghamton as base commander of Taratupa. This is done so Binghamton does not have to face tough-as-nails Admiral &quot;Iron Pants&quot; Rafferty (Philip Ober), who is inspecting naval installations (an episode with a young Raquel Welch as Lt. Wilson).

Sometimes, Binghamton tries to use legitimate means to get rid of McHale and/or his crew, although usually in an underhanded way. In &quot;All Chiefs and No Indians&quot;, Binghamton tries to get the whole crew promoted to chief petty officers so they will be split up and reassigned. When they deliberately fail the exams after they find out what Binghamton is up to, he gives them all passing grades anyway. Another example is in the episode entitled &quot;Little Red Riding Doctor&quot;, in which Don Knotts is Army psychiatrist Lt. Pratt, whom Binghamton tries to con into believing McHale&#x27;s crew is suffering a terrible case of combat fatigue and should be sent back to the States.

====Lieutenant Carpenter====
Lieutenant Elroy Carpenter (Bob Hastings, a veteran of &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;) – Binghamton&#x27;s sycophantic bumbler aide who tries to be military, but is too inept to be taken seriously. He is slow to catch on and does not know when to keep his mouth shut. Like Parker, he often knocks down Binghamton, or causes Binghamton to be knocked down, because of his clumsiness and dimwittedness. However, again like Parker, Carpenter is also subjected to Binghamton&#x27;s tirades. Early in the first season, Lt. Carpenter commands &quot;PT-116&quot;, but soon drifts into less responsibility. In &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1964), Carpenter says he is from Cleveland. In the spin-off movie &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;, Carpenter is in charge of &quot;PT-116&quot;, which is promptly sunk in the first few minutes of the movie.

====&quot;PT-73&quot; crew====
Quartermaster George &quot;Christy&quot; Christopher (Gary Vinson, who also appeared in the dramatic pilot &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot;) – Whenever McHale is not personally steering the &quot;PT-73&quot;, it will be Christy at the helm. Besides Binghamton, he is the only married man and the only one with any children. Christy marries Lt. Gloria Winters (Cindy Robbins) early in the series in &quot;Operation Wedding Party&quot; and she moves to San Diego. They have a daughter not long afterwards in &quot;The Big Raffle&quot; episode. Because his crew helped them get married, their daughter is named Quintina Charlene Leslie Wilhelmina Harriet Virginia Hetty Fujiana after the crew (for Quinton, Charles, Lester, Willy, Harrison, Virgil, Happy and Fuji).

Radioman Willy Moss (John Wright, who also appeared in &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot;) – A good-natured Southerner from Tennessee who operates the crew&#x27;s still and is in charge of radio and telephone communication for the crew. He also serves as the &quot;PT-73&quot;″s sonar operator. In &quot;The British Also Have Ensigns&quot;, he is revealed to have nine brothers and sisters.

Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate Lester Gruber (Carl Ballantine) – A hustler and hack magician whose get-rich-quick schemes (such as promoting gambling and selling moonshine and war souvenirs) often get the crew in trouble (when the crew is not stealing supplies or equipment). Gruber hails from Brooklyn, worked in a used car sales lot, and frequently references the Brooklyn Dodgers and Ebbets Field.

Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate Harrison James &quot;Tinker&quot; Bell (Billy Sands, who played Pvt. Paparelli on &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;) – A top-notch mechanic who is in charge of keeping the &quot;PT-73&quot; running.

Gunner&#x27;s Mate Virgil Edwards (Edson Stroll) – A handsome and well-built lover boy who is a crack shot with a .50-caliber machine gun. According to the episode &quot;The Truth Hurts&quot;, Virgil has been in the service at least six years.

Seaman Joseph &quot;Happy&quot; Haines (Gavin MacLeod, later of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;) – MacLeod left the series before the third season to appear in the movie &quot;The Sand Pebbles.&quot; He had also appeared in the 1959 film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, which has a few similarities to &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy.&quot;

Note: In the first season, the crew members are on an equal social footing, but in later seasons, a &quot;pecking order&quot; is established with Gruber at the head, apparently the chief of the boat although three of the crewmen outrank him. Based on the &quot;crows&quot; (insignia of rank) on their dress white uniforms, Christy, Virgil and Bell are all petty officers, 1st class, Willy and Gruber are petty officers, 2nd class and Happy is a seaman (he does not wear a patch).

====Fuji====
Seaman 3rd Class Fujiwara Takeo Kobiaji, nicknamed &quot;Fuji&quot; (Yoshio Yoda) – Perhaps the most unusual character in the series, the lovable, boyish, Japanese prisoner of war and deserter from the Imperial Japanese Navy whom the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew takes on as a &quot;de facto&quot; comrade and keeps hidden from Binghamton and almost everyone outside of McHale&#x27;s gang. In the episode titled &quot;A Letter for Fuji&quot;, his name is given as Fujiwara Takeo; in &quot;The August Teahouse of Quint McHale&quot; and the film &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;, it is given as Takeo Fujiwara. In a Japanese name, the family name precedes the given name.

Although Fuji is a member of the Japanese military and has a girlfriend in Japan (Mioshi, whom he finds out is married), his only loyalty is to the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew and not the Japanese war effort. In the episodes &quot;The Truth Hurts&quot; and &quot;The Vampire of Taratupa&quot;, Fuji is revealed to be from Yokohama. In the tag of one of the fourth season episodes set in Italy, he is revealed to have a second cousin who is a lieutenant in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. In exchange for being given a safe house instead of imprisonment in a prisoner-of-war camp, Fuji gladly &quot;serves time&quot; as the crew&#x27;s houseboy and cook at their camp on &quot;McHale&#x27;s Island.&quot;

Keeping Fuji&#x27;s presence and identity a secret from Captain Binghamton and others is a running gag, with wacky consequences throughout the series. For instance, in the premiere episode (&quot;An Ensign For McHale&quot;), to avoid detection during an inspection by Binghamton, Fuji disguises himself and poses as a Polynesian chief, which Binghamton accepts despite initially questioning his Japanese appearance and Japanese accent. In the first episode set in Europe (&quot;War, Italian Style&quot;), he is passed off as a member of the 442nd Japanese-American Regiment, where he finds a second cousin through his mother&#x27;s family of Kobayashi. In &quot;The Mothers of &quot;PT-73&quot;&quot; and &quot;Orange Blossoms for McHale&quot;, he is presented as a Filipino houseboy. In &quot;Fuji&#x27;s Big Romance&quot;, he is a part-Hawaiian sailor.

Fuji is involved in a frequent scenario on the show. Whenever Binghamton is seen approaching the island unannounced, the crew converges on McHale for instructions. Naturally, the primary concern is to get Fuji out of sight before he is spotted. Invariably, the first order out of McHale&#x27;s mouth is, &quot;Fuji, head for the hills!&quot; whereupon he takes off for the other side of the island. This scenario is played out so often, in one episode in the later seasons, McHale begins, &quot;Fuji…&quot; and Fuji finishes, &quot;I know. Head for hills.&quot; Fuji&#x27;s seemingly fluent yet awkward command of the English language serves as a comic device; particularly humorous is the unexpected and arbitrary use of American colloquialisms and ethnic phrases, all spoken with a thick Japanese accent—personal catchphrases include the Yiddish lament &quot;Oy vey&quot; and the Italian exclamation &quot;.&quot; He fondly calls Commander McHale &quot;Skippa-san&quot; and Ensign Parker &quot;Parka-san&quot;, incorporating the Japanese honorific &quot;san&quot;.

===Other characters===
====Urulu====
Many of the episodes in the South Pacific involve interactions with native islanders. The most colorful is Polynesian chief and witchdoctor, Pali Urulu (Jacques Aubuchon), who is as shifty and scheming as McHale and his men. When McHale and the crew are in Urulu&#x27;s village, the chief displays a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. When the Japanese troops arrive, Urulu turns it over to reveal a portrait of Japanese Emperor Hirohito. In another episode he does the same thing with the Japanese and American flags.

Though &quot;primitive&quot;, Urulu is like Gruber, from whom he learns a lot, usually to Gruber&#x27;s regret—a hustler who is always looking for ways to make money or swindle money from the Navy. In the episode titled &quot;We Do the Voodoo&quot;, after Binghamton refuses to pay Urulu for damage to his coconut grove, Urulu uses his powers to put a curse on Binghamton, who then has a streak of bad luck. In &quot;The Balloon Goes Up&quot;, Urulu displays the sign &quot;Gone Headhunting&quot; when he leaves his hut and is called a cannibal by Binghamton and McHale (no indication that it is meant to be taken literally). Aubuchon also played the Russian sailor Dimitri in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;.

====Big Frenchy====
Another shifty character is Big Frenchy, played by George Kennedy in episodes titled &quot;French Leave For McHale&quot; and &quot;The Return of Big Frenchy.&quot; He is a thieving French smuggler, captain of a small boat, and an old friend of McHale&#x27;s who knows better than to turn his back to him. In &quot;The Return of Big Frenchy&quot;, he convinces Binghamton and Parker that he is a member of the &quot;French Underground&quot; (French Resistance) so he can steal supplies. Kennedy also played businessman Henri Le Clerc of New Caledonia in the 1964 movie. Kennedy began his career in showbiz as a technical adviser on the &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot; show.

====Senior officers====
The show has its share of admirals. Admiral Rogers is played by Roy Roberts in 22 episodes. In some episodes, his first name is John, while in others, it is Bruce. Herbert Lytton played Admiral Roscoe G. Reynolds in 11 episodes. Bill Quinn played Benson, Slocum and Admiral Bruce Elliott in six episodes. Willis Bouchey played Admiral Hawkins in three episodes. Admiral Rafferty was played by Philip Ober in &quot;McHale, the Desk Commando&quot; and &quot;McHale&#x27;s Floating Laudromat&quot;.

Ted Knight played Admiral &quot;Go-Go&quot; Granger in &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot; and &quot;One of Our Engines is Missing&quot;, In &quot;Uncle Admiral&quot;, Harry Von Zell played Ensign Parker&#x27;s uncle, Vice Admiral Tim &quot;Bull Dog&quot; Parker. Simon Scott played General Bronson nine times when the show is in Italy. Henry Beckman as U.S. Army Colonel Harrigan was also a regular presence in the Italian episodes as Binghamton&#x27;s superior and also a thorn in Binghamton&#x27;s side—as a schemer, Harrigan is sometimes on McHale&#x27;s side, sometimes on Binghamton&#x27;s side, or plays one against the other as best suits his purposes. Beckman also played Air Corps Colonel Pratt in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;.

====Multiple character roles====
Peggy Mondo played several roles in the series. She played the heavyset daughter of a Polynesian chief, Little Flower, who is always looking for a husband such as Ensign Parker or even Binghamton. Mondo also played Fifi in &quot;French Leave for McHale&quot; and a few episodes as Mama Giovanni and Rosa Giovanni when the crew is in Italy. Stanley Adams played a native chief, the Shah of Durani, and political boss Frank Templeton in the last episode &quot;Wally for Congress.&quot; Richard Jury played Lt. Plowright in &quot;Parents Anonymous&quot; and a goofy dentist in &quot;The Novocain Mutiny.&quot; Both Syl Lamont, who played Yeoman Tate and Clay Tanner, who played a Marine guard, appeared in the series a number of times.

Tony Franke appeared in the series several times and as Sgt. Frank Tresh in the movie &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force.&quot; Dick Wilson played Voltafiori citizen and partner of the mayor, Dino Baroni. Walter Brooke and Nelson Olmstead each played several different naval officers. Among the actors who repeatedly played Japanese soldiers and sailors are Dale Kino (who also played a Nisei sergeant), John Fujioka, and Mako (who starred in the movie &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, for which MacLeod left the series).

====Guest stars====
In &quot;The Missing Link&quot;, Marlo Thomas played Binghamton&#x27;s niece, Cynthia Prentice, who takes an interest in Ensign Parker, although it turns out entirely for anthropological reasons. In &quot;Camera, Action, Panic&quot;, Arte Johnson played the bumbling Cameraman Sweeney who is making a movie of the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew in action. In &quot;Is There a Doctor in the Hut&quot;, Bernie Kopell (who starred with MacLeod on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;) played Colonel Pryer, who is the obnoxious manager of movie star Rita Howard, played by Lisa Seagram. In &quot;Hello McHale? Colonna!&quot; McHale finagles to have comic Jerry Colonna do an unscheduled Special Services show. Pat Harrington Jr. played the thieving Guido Panzini in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Country Club Caper&quot;.

Steve Franken played the snooty Lt. Jason Whitworth III in &quot;Birth of a Salesman&quot;, whom Binghamton hopes will give him a job selling insurance after the war. George Furth played the self-centered Roger Whitfield III, who tries to take advantage of Binghamton&#x27;s hopes to get his old job back at the yacht club owned by Whitfield&#x27;s father in &quot;Dart Gun Wedding&quot;. Marvin Kaplan played the MIT electronics genius Ensign Eugene J. Kwazniak in &quot;All Ahead, Empty&quot;, in which the &quot;PT-73&quot; is wired for remote control. Bernard Fox played the clumsy Sub-Lieutenant Cedric Clivedon in &quot;The British Also Have Ensigns.&quot; Susan Silo played Virgil&#x27;s stowaway girlfriend Babette in &quot;Babette, Go Home&quot;. Jesse Pearson played singing idol Harley Hatfield in &quot;The Rage of Taratupa&quot;.

In &quot;Make Room for Orvie&quot;, Michael Burns played 18-year-old Seaman Orvie Tuttle, who is the newest member of the &quot;PT-73&quot; crew, but who does not go with the crew when they move to Italy in the next episode. Ann McCrea was cast as Carol Kimberly in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1963). In &quot;The Comrades of 73&quot;, in which the &quot;PT-73&quot; is slated to be sent to the Soviet Union as part of Lend Lease, Sue Ane Langdon played Russian commander Krasni and Cliff Norton played Russian admiral Gurevitch (Norton also played an Australian sergeant major in the 1964 movie and Major Bill Grady in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot;).

====&quot;PT-73&quot; crew love life====
McHale&#x27;s always hopeful love interest while the show is in the South Pacific is Navy Nurse Molly Turner (Jane Dulo from &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;), a New Jersey gal who is always trying to corner the ever romantically elusive McHale. Another love interest of the reluctant McHale is an old friend and a bit of a wildcat Kate O&#x27;Hara (Joyce Jameson). At first, his crew tries to get McHale interested in her, then Kate tries to blackmail McHale into marrying her and then Binghamton tries to blackmail her into marrying McHale when she tries to back out herself. Yet another love interest of the always reluctant McHale is Maggie Monohan (Jean Willes) in &quot;The Return of Maggie&quot;, the owner of a gambling joint in New Caledonia and an old flame of McHale&#x27;s who wants him back, but he does not want her back. Willes played a very similar role as Margot Monet in the 1964 movie. Willes also played Congresswoman Clara Carter Clarke in &quot;Send Us a Hero.&quot;

Though painfully shy around women, Ensign Parker&#x27;s love interest in the South Pacific is Yvette Gerard, a lovely French girl from a nearby island played by Claudine Longet (who also played an almost identical character, Andrea Bouchard of New Caledonia, in the 1964 movie). In &quot;A Medal for Parker&quot;, his girlfriend back home in Chagrin Falls is Mary (Kathleen Gately), who is more interested in dating a war hero than Parker.

While the very bashful Parker is shy around women, women are not always shy around Parker, such as in &quot;The Happy Sleepwalker&quot; when Lt. Nancy Culpepper (Sheila James) finds Parker irresistible. In &quot;The Vampire of Taratupa&quot;, Parker dates Lt. Melba Benson (Ann Elder), who is as big a klutz as he is. In the episode entitled &quot;36-24-73&quot;, situated in Italy, hints are given of a relationship developing between Parker and by-the-book female Ensign Sandra Collins (Maura McGiveney) after he sternly corrects her about in what sections certain regulations are (they then talk about what regulations are their favorites).

Along with other WAVES clad in bathing suits, they provide valuable (albeit totally unwitting) assistance in capturing a German U-boat when its captain runs the U-boat aground trying to get a better look. McGiveney also played the part of Judy in &quot;The Stool Parrot&quot; episode. Although the crew (especially the lover-boy Virgil) is forever chasing women (Navy nurses, native island girls or local Italian women), certain women gain their interest more than others. After receiving a &quot;Dear John letter&quot;, shy and broken-hearted Willy&#x27;s love interest becomes Southern belle Nurse Cindy Bates (Brenda Wright). Tinker tries to impress and win over fickle Nurse Betsy Gordonlove (Barbara Werle) in &quot;Scuttlebutt.&quot;

Happy&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Happy Sleepwalker&quot; is Lt. Anne Wright (Lois Roberts). When Gruber&#x27;s girlfriend Ginger (Jean Hale) shows up to surprise him in &quot;Lester, the Skipper&quot;, McHale is talked into letting Gruber pretend he is the commander of the &quot;PT-73&quot; while she is there. In &quot;Fuji&#x27;s Big Romance&quot;, the lonely prisoner of war falls for lovely Sulani (Yvonne Ribuca), the daughter of a Polynesian chief, when the crew sympathetically takes him along on one of their social outings to a luau with the native islanders. Other than Binghamton and Christy, none of the regular characters on the show is married and only Christy has any children.

===The real-life &quot;PT-73&quot;===
The real-life &quot;PT-73&quot; was finished on August 12, 1942, by Higgins Industries, Iinc., New Orleans. It was long, weighed 56 tons and had a top speed of 40 knots. It was assigned to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 13 under the command of Commander James B. Denny, USN. The squadron participated in the Aleutian Islands Campaign from March 1943 to May 1944. The squadron was then transferred to the Southwest Pacific, where the squadron saw action at Mios Woendi, Dutch New Guinea; Mindoro, Philippine Islands; and Brunei Bay, Borneo.

The squadron was also based for a time at Dreger Harbor, New Guinea and San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands, but saw no action from these bases. Overall, the real &quot;PT-73&quot; did not have the kind of illustrious combat record depicted in the series. On January 15, 1945, it ran aground off Lubang Island in the Philippine Islands after delivering supplies to Filipino guerrillas and was destroyed by the crew to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

==Production==

The Pacific Ocean naval base stood on the back lot of Universal Studios. For years after the show went off the air, the sets were an attraction on the studio tour. The portion of the Universal Studios tour involving Bruce the Shark attacking the tourist tram takes place on McHale&#x27;s Lagoon, according to the tour guides. Three &quot;PT-73&quot; boats were used in the show. One was for shots at sea and two were converted World War II air-sea rescue boats based at Universal Studios, which were reconfigured above-deck to resemble the vessel used in filming the &quot;PT-73&quot; underway; a type II Vosper MTB (motor torpedo boat), a British design built in the U.S. for export to the Soviet Union.

The war ended in August 1945 before the boat, hull number &quot;PT-694&quot;, was sent to the Soviet Union. The boat was purchased by Howard Hughes for a chase boat for the only flight of his &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; aircraft. The boat was sold to the studio—as there were few PT boats in existence, almost all having been sold, stripped, or destroyed after the war by various governments—where significant liberties were taken reconfiguring the Vosper 694 and the two air-sea rescue boats to resemble a World War II-era PT boat. 
* The Vosper&#x27;s charthouse and bridge configuration were kept.
* Gun turrets were added to both sides of the charthouse about where they would have been on a stock Vosper 71-foot, but this was not the configuration of the Elco boats, but mimicked the Higgins 78&#x27; PT-71 Class boats.
* On McHale&#x27;s boat, each gun turret mounted a single M2 heavy machine gun on an external, tubular steel spindle fed from a 100-round .50 caliber ammunition box, whereas the real boats used two aircraft M2 heavy machine guns in Mk-17 gun mount / Mk-9 gun carriage combinations that rotated within the body of the turret and had integral ammunition magazines and feed systems holding 250 rounds in disintegrating belts for each gun. 
* The turrets in the show also did away with the wrap-around safety cages that kept the .50 cal gunners from accidentally firing into the boat during the heat of combat.
* A single .50 caliber M2 mounted on an M4 autocannon-style pipe stand tended to appear, disappear, and move around from scene to scene on the forward deck. Normally, the forward gun would have been an either an .50 caliber M2 heavy machine gun or Oerlikon 20-mm antiaircraft cannon on a pedestal to the right of centerline, back nearer the charthouse and possibly an M4 autocannon (37-mm Browning aircraft cannon) or a 37-mm M3 Army antitank gun strapped or bolted to the deck forward (as had been thought the case for the &quot;PT-109&quot;).
* A pseudo-&quot;radar&quot; unit and mast was added aft of midhull, where normally an Mk-4 Oerlikon 20-mm single antiaircraft cannon was mounted. The mast on the &quot;PT-73&quot; command-bridge was also incorrect.
* The 40-mm Bofors cannon or pedestal-mounted Oerlikon 20-mm antiaircraft cannon usually found on the aft deck was done away with completely, as was one of the engine compartment ventilator housings and the M2 smoke screen generator.
* Two mock-ups of US Navy MK-18, swing-out, torpedo tubes (as carried on the early war 80-foot Elco boats like the &quot;PT-109&quot;) replacing the MK-7/8 tubes normally carried by the Vosper 71-foot. 
* The gunwale side cut-outs normally seen on the Vosper, were built-up forward of the cabin, creating a flush forward deck. Normally, the Vosper required forward clearance in front of the Mk 7/8 tubes when torpedoes were fired over the gunwale.
* Shots of the crew aboard the &quot;PT-73&quot; were usually staged on a full-scale mock-up of the bridge and gun tubs in front of a front projection screen at Universal.

The final known appearance of &quot;PT-73&quot; (one of the converted 63-foot air-sea rescue boats) was in the 1970s show &quot;Emergency!&quot; (&quot;Quicker Than the Eye&quot;, season 4, episode 8, aired: November 9, 1974). Per the storyline: Station 51 was dispatched to a movie studio to rescue a man trapped beneath a boat; the boat in question was being moved from one end of the studio to another by truck, and wooden supports holding it had broken and trapped a man underneath. As seen in the episode, shadowed lettering of &quot;PT-73&quot; is visible on the bow of the boat, which was missing its pilot house, masts, and depth charges.

No record of the final fate of either converted 63-foot air-sea rescue boat has been found. The sea-going &quot;PT-73&quot; (the ex-Howard Hughes &quot;PT-694&quot; boat) was sold in 1966 to a private owner, and converted to a sport-fishing boat. In 1992, the boat was destroyed when it broke from its mooring near Santa Barbara and washed up on the beach during a storm.

==Spinoff==
Producer Edward Montagne set up a female version of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; entitled &quot;Broadside,&quot; which ran for 32 episodes on ABC during the 1964–65 television season. In place of the PT crew were a group of WAVES led by Anne Morgan (Kathleen Nolan) consisting of Joan Staley, Sheila James, Lois Roberts and Jimmy Boyd (as a male with a female name), up against Binghamton-type Captain Edward Andrews and his Lt. Carpenter clone George Furth, who guest-starred in an episode of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; entitled &quot;Dart Gun Wedding.&quot; Dick Sargent provided a love interest for Nolan.

Although not an actual spinoff, Tim Conway and Joe Flynn teamed up playing characters with similar personalities in &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;, which lasted only 13 episodes in 1970.

== Merchandise and other media ==
Dell Comics published three issues of a comic adaptation in 1963. There was also a Dell comic adaptation of the first film in 1964.

A board game, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Game&quot;, was published by Transogram in 1962. A trading card set was published by Fleer in 1965.

Years after the show ended, Borgnine and Conway played the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; superhero team Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

==Theatrical films==

Two feature film spin-offs were based on the series: &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1964) and &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot; (1965). The cast appeared in both films, with the exception of Borgnine and Ballantine in the latter film; Borgnine was not available due to schedule conflicts with the filming of &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;; why Ballantine was absent is not known. To beef up the crew, MacLeod, who had left the series, returned for this appearance. In a &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; interview, Borgnine said that Montagne wanted to make the film cheaply, without him, and would not show him the script. Both films have the same basic plot scheme as the series in the South Pacific and, in many ways, were merely extensions of the series. Even parts of the filming location for New Caledonia in the first movie are identical to episodes from the series.

Both films were produced without laugh tracks. The sea-going &quot;PT-73&quot; was extensively filmed running between San Pedro and Catalina Island&#x27;s Avalon harbor, which stood in for the fictional town where the show was set. While both did well at the box office, the latter film was not as successful and was derided by critics as being too excessive in its use of slapstick comedy, though others praised it for satirizing of military incompetence (after a typical screw-up, the Japanese POW Fuji sighs, &quot;Beats me how they beating us.&quot;). William Lederer, who co-authored the second film with John Fenton Murray, used scenes lifted directly from his comic novel, &quot;All the Ships at Sea.&quot;

Unlike the television series, both movies were filmed in Technicolor. &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1964) earned an estimated $2,250,000 in North American rentals. &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot; took in $1,500,000 .

In 1997, a sequel was released, also named &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;. It starred Tom Arnold as McHale&#x27;s son, a United States Naval Academy graduate. The film showed the &quot;PT-73&quot; and its crew operating in a modern, post-World War II setting in the Caribbean. Borgnine has a cameo appearance as the senior McHale, commanding rear admiral of what appears to be the United States Naval Special Warfare Command and going by the code name &quot;Cobra.&quot;

==Home media==
Shout! Factory has released all four seasons of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; on DVD in Region 1. In November 2015, Shout! released &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 21-disc set contained all 138 episodes and both theatrical films in special collectible packaging. In Australia, Madman Entertainment released all four seasons on DVD. Madman released the first three seasons in Australia in August 2009, in Slimline packaging, replacing the original releases, which were box sets. In June 2011, a Slimline-packaged set of season 4 was seen in Big W stores in Australia in Region 4, however, no details indicate the item being available elsewhere. All full episodes are now available on YouTube.

<text>Vincenzo Antinori (1792–1865) was a science administrator in Italy.

From 1829 to 1859, Antinori was director of the Regal Museum of Physics and Natural History in Florence where he worked with Leopoldo Nobili on electromagnetic induction. He had originally attracted Nobili to Florence to teach physics, as he had Giovanni Battista Amici to teach astronomy.

He was one of the promoters of the Congress of Italian Scientists in Pisa in 1839 and in Florence in 1841 and was responsible for bringing permanence, order and security to the Italian legacy of meteorological data by founding the Italian Meteorological Archive.

Antinori was a member of the Accademia della Crusca and wrote many entries for the Crusca dictionary on scientific topics. He had a particular interest in preserving and interpreting documents and artefacts from the work of Galileo Galilei and his followers.

<doc id="974525" wikidata="Q26118" url="?curid=974525" title="Jack Hawkins">
<text>John Edward Hawkins, CBE (14 September 1910 – 18 July 1973) was an English actor who worked on stage and in film from the 1930s until the 1970s. One of the most popular British film stars of the 1950s, he was known for his portrayal of military men.

==Career==
Hawkins was born at 45 Lyndhurst Road, Wood Green, in Middlesex (now London Borough of Haringey), the son of a builder. He was educated at Wood Green&#x27;s Trinity County Grammar School, where, aged eight, he joined the school choir.

By the age of ten Hawkins had joined the local operatic society, and made his stage debut in Patience by Gilbert and Sullivan. His parents enrolled him in the Italia Conti Academy, and whilst he was studying there he made his London stage debut, when aged thirteen, playing the Elf King in &quot;Where the Rainbow Ends&quot; at the Holborn Empire on Boxing Day, December 1923, a production that also included the young Noël Coward. The following year aged 14 he played the page in a production of &quot;Saint Joan&quot; by George Bernard Shaw. Five years later he was in a production of &quot;Beau Geste&quot; alongside Laurence Olivier.

He appeared on Broadway in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; by the age of 18.

===1930s===
In the 1930s Hawkins&#x27;s focus was on the stage. He worked in the companies of Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud and Basil Dean. His performances included &quot;Port Said&quot; by Emlyn Williams (1931), &quot;Below the Surface&quot; by HL Stoker and LS Hunt (1932), &quot;Red Triangle&quot; by Val Gielgud (1932), &quot;Service&quot; by CI Anthony, for director Basil Dean (1933), &quot;One of Us&quot; by Frank Howard, &quot;As You Like It&quot; by William Shakespeare (1933) and &quot;Iron Flowers&quot; by Cecil Lewis (1933, with Jessica Tandy his wife).

He started appearing in films, including &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (1930), &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1932), (starring Ivor Novello), &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1933), &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; (1933), &quot;I Lived with You&quot; (1933), &quot;The Jewel&quot; (1933), &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1933), and &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot; (1934).

In 1932 he was in a radio production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; with John Gielgud and Robert Donat and the following year he was in &quot;Danger&quot;. He was also in &quot;Death at Broadcasting House&quot; (1934), &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (1934), and &quot;Peg of Old Drury&quot; (1935).

Stage roles included &quot;While Parents Sleep&quot; (1932) by Anthony Kimmins, &quot;Iron Mistress&quot; (1934) by Arthur Macrae; then an open air Shakespeare festival – &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1934) (with Anna Neagle), &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1934), &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot; (1934). Some of these productions were done on radio. &quot;The Maitlands&quot; by Ronald Mackenzie (1934) was for John Gielgud&#x27;s company. He was Horatio to Gielgud&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1934). He also appeared in &quot;Accidentally Yours&quot; by Clifford Grey (1935), &quot;The World Waits&quot; by Clifford Hummel (1935), &quot;Coincidence&quot; by Bryce Robertson (1935) and &quot;The Frog&quot; (1935).

Films in the late 1930s included &quot;Beauty and the Barge&quot; (1937), &quot;The Frog&quot; (1937), (which Hawkins played on stage), &quot;Who Goes Next?&quot; (1938), &quot;A Royal Divorce&quot; (1938), &quot;Murder Will Out&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Flying Squad&quot; (1940).

Theatre appearances included &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1937), &quot;Autumn&quot; by Margaret Kennedy and Gregory Ratoff (1937, with Flora Robson for Basil Dean), &quot;The King&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; by Rita Welman and Maurice Marks (1937–38), &quot;No More Music&quot; by Rosamund Lehman (1938), &quot;Can We Tell?&quot; by Robert Gore Brown (1938), &quot;Traitors Gate&quot; by Norma Stuart (1938) and &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; by Dodie Smith (1938–39).

===Second World War===
Having attended an Officer Cadet Training Unit, he was commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army, as a second lieutenant on 8 March 1941. On 22 January 1944, he transferred to the Expeditionary Force Institutes in the rank of lieutenant. He served with ENSA in India and Southeast Asia. He relinquished his commission as a lieutenant (substantive) on 11 October 1946, and was granted the honorary rank of colonel.

During his military service, he was employed by Ealing Studios to make &quot;The Next of Kin&quot; (1942). 

===Post-war career===
Hawkins left the army in July 1946. Two weeks later he appeared on stage in &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; at £10 a week. The following year he starred in &quot;Othello&quot;, to a mixed reception.

Hawkins&#x27;s wife became pregnant and he became concerned about his future. He decided to accept a contract with Sir Alexander Korda for three years at £50 a week. Hawkins had been recommended to Korda by the latter&#x27;s production executive, Bill Bryden, who was married to Elizabeth Allen, who had worked with Hawkins.

The association began badly when Hawkins was cast in Korda&#x27;s notorious flop &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (1948), as Lord George Murray. However he followed it with a good role in the successful, highly acclaimed &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948), for Carol Reed. He appeared in &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1949), for Powell and Pressburger; he starred as the villain alongside Douglas Fairbanks Jr in the Sidney Gilliat directed &quot;State Secret&quot; (1950). 

He was recruited by 20th Century Fox to support Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, by playing the Prince of Wales in the expensive epic &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (1950). He made another with Powell and Pressburger for Korda, &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; (1950).

Hawkins played the lead in &quot;The Adventurers&quot; (1951), shot in South Africa, then had a good role in another Hollywood-financed film shot in Britain, &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; (1951), with James Stewart. It was followed by a British thriller with Ralph Richardson, &quot;Home at Seven&quot; (1952).

In the spring of 1951 he went to Broadway and played Mercutio in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with Olivia de Havilland.

===Stardom===
Hawkins became a star with the release of three successful films in which he played stern but sympathetic authority figures: &quot;Angels One Five&quot; (1951), as an RAF officer during the war; &quot;The Planter&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1952), as a rubber planter combating communists in the Malayan Emergency (with Claudette Colbert); and &quot;Mandy&quot; (1952), the headmaster of a school for the deaf. All films ranked among the top ten most popular films at the British box office in 1952 and British exhibitors voted him the fourth most popular British star at the local box office.

Hawkins starred in &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), playing a driven naval officer in World War II. Sir Michael Balcon said: &quot;Even before the script was written, we knew it had to be Jack Hawkins. If he hadn&#x27;t been free to play the part, then there wouldn&#x27;t have been a film.&quot; &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; was the most successful film of the year and saw Hawkins voted the most popular star in Britain regardless of nationality.

According to his &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary, he &quot;exemplified for many cinemagoers the stiff upper lip tradition prevalent in post-war British films. His craggy looks and authoritative bearing were used to good effect whatever branch of the services he represented.&quot;

&quot;Malta Story&quot; (1953), was another military story, with Hawkins as an RAF officer in the Siege of Malta during the war. It too was a hit, the ninth most popular film in Britain in 1953.

He had a guest role in &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (1953) for Emeric Pressburger. He followed this with two mildly popular dramas – &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1953) and &quot;Front Page Story&quot; (1954).

&quot;The Seekers&quot; (1954), was partly shot in New Zealand and cast Hawkins in a rare romantic role. &quot;My film wives to date usually stay home and knit, or else have conveniently died before the film starts,&quot; he said. It was followed by &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1955), an unconventional drama, playing the shrewd interrogator in an authoritarian country who gets a respected priest (played by Alec Guinness) to discredit himself. None of these films was commercially successful but Hawkins was still voted the fifth biggest star at the British box office for 1954, and the most popular British one. &quot;It&#x27;s an enviable position, I know&quot;, said Hawkins. &quot;But I have to be more careful now about the parts I choose, and it&#x27;s hard not to offend people. Everyone thinks his own script is the best.&quot;

He turned down the role of Colonel Carne in &quot;The Glorious Gloucesters&quot; for Warwick Films and Captain Cook for a project for the Rank organisation; 

&quot;I&#x27;m tired of playing decent fellows&quot;, he said in a 1954 interview, &quot;with stiff upper lip and even stiffer morals. I&#x27;m going to kill them off before they kill me as an actor. And I want stories written for me, not rejects intended for other fellows... I just inherit them from other people. Often, I find they&#x27;ve left the name of the actor originally suggested for the role. Always the same old names ... Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck ... five or six others. Before the script reaches them, somebody remembers me – especially if it&#x27;s one of those infernally nice characters.&quot;

===International star===
Hawkins got his wish when he received a Hollywood offer to play a pharaoh for Howard Hawks in &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; (1955).

He returned home to make an Ealing comedy, &quot;Touch and Go&quot; (1955), which was not particularly popular. He was more comfortably cast as a police officer in &quot;The Long Arm&quot; (1956), and a test pilot in &quot;The Man in the Sky&quot; (1957). He was an insurance investigator in Sidney Gilliat&#x27;s &quot;Fortune Is a Woman&quot; (1957).

Hawkins&#x27;s career received a major boost when supporting William Holden and Alec Guinness, in the highly acclaimed &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957). 

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1958.

Hawkins played the lead role in a film for John Ford, playing a police officer in &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day&quot; (USA title: &quot;Gideon of Scotland Yard&quot;) (1958). He had a good role as a double agent in a war film, &quot;The Two-Headed Spy&quot; (1958) then was given another third lead in a Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), playing the Roman admiral who befriends Charlton Heston. It was even more successful than &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.

He appeared as one of &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1959) in the Sapphire Films TV series for ITV. He also played the lead in an American TV version of &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot;.

He appeared in a heist film considered quite ground-breaking at the time for its references to sex, and popular at the British box office, also providing Hawkins with his final lead role in &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; (1960). 

However, though initially sought for the role of a gay barrister in &quot;Victim&quot;, he turned it down fearing that it might conflict with his masculine image. The role was eventually played by Dirk Bogarde.

===Decline as star===
A three-packet-a-day chain smoker, Hawkins began experiencing voice problems in the late 1950s; unbeknownst to the public, he had undergone cobalt treatment in 1959 for what was then described as a secondary condition of the larynx, but which was probably cancer.

Hawkins became worried about his voice and was concerned he would lose it. This caused him to take almost any work that was available. &quot;I had to be realistic and take as much money as I could get while the going was good&quot;, he said. He played General Cornwallis in a European epic, &quot;La Fayette&quot; (1961). and appeared with Shirley MacLaine and Laurence Harvey in &quot;Two Loves&quot; (1961), and supported Rosalind Russell in &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; (1962).

&quot;There are not all that number of mature leading men around&quot;, he said in a 1961 interview. &quot;There seems to be a generation missing. I think people quit going into the acting profession. A lot of them drifted out during the war. And then when the war was over it was difficult for them to get back into the theatre.&quot;

He was in another big hit in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), as General Allenby. &quot;Rampage&quot; (1963) was less distinguished, an alcoholic priest in &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964). He had supporting parts in &quot;The Third Secret&quot; (1964), &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot; (1964), and &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965). &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1965) gave him a lead opposite Cliff Robertson. He made some appearances on US TV: &quot;To Bury Caesar&quot; with Pamela Brown in 1963 and &quot;Back to Back&quot; for &quot;The Bob Hope Theatre&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Judith&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Poppy Is Also a Flower&quot; (1966).

===Illness===
In December 1965, Hawkins was diagnosed with throat cancer. His entire larynx was removed in January 1966. In March of that year he appeared at a royal screening of &quot;Born Free&quot; attended by the Queen and received a standing ovation.

Thereafter, his performances were dubbed, often (with Hawkins&#x27;s approval) by Robert Rietti or Charles Gray. Hawkins continued to smoke after losing his voice. In private, he used a mechanical larynx to aid his speech.

In 1967 it was reported that he would direct Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Battalion&quot; in Mexico but the film was not made.
Instead he resumed his acting career, with his voice dubbed and dialogue kept to a minimum: &quot;Shalako&quot; (1968) and &quot;Great Catherine&quot; (1968). In &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), playing Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, he had no lines at all. He had an operation to restore his voice in 1968. It did not work; Hawkins could talk but only in a croaking voice.

&quot;The fact that producers are still offering me work is a source of much gratitude to me&quot;, he said in 1969. &quot;I flatter myself that when they cast me in a part it&#x27;s me Jack Hawkins they want and not the person who was once Jack Hawkins... if you know what I mean. And I&#x27;m perfectly honest with anyone who hires me. I tell them exactly what they&#x27;re letting themselves in for.&quot;

Some rare comedies followed: &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust&quot; (1969), &quot;Twinky&quot; (1970), &quot;The Adventures of Gerard&quot; (1970). There was more typical fare: &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1970), &quot;The Beloved&quot; (1971), &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot; (1971), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1971).
&quot;The Last Lion&quot; (1972), shot in South Africa, offered him a rare lead. It was followed by &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972), &quot;Escape to the Sun&quot; (1972), &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tales That Witness Madness&quot; (1973).

Hawkins also produced the film adaptation of Peter Barnes&#x27;s &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972), with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Alastair Sim.

==Personal life==
Hawkins married actress Jessica Tandy in 1932, and the couple divorced in 1940. Together, they had one daughter, Susan Hawkins (1934–2004). In 1947, Hawkins married former actress Doreen Lawrence (1919–2013), together, they had three children, Caroline (b. 1955), Andrew (b. 1950), and Nicholas, and they remained married until his death in 1973.

==Death==
In May 1973, Hawkins had an experimental operation on his throat to insert an artificial voice box. He started haemorrhaging and was admitted to St Stephen&#x27;s Hospital, Fulham Road, London, in June, forcing him to drop out of &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974), in which Hawkins was to have played a Russian general. He died on 18 July 1973, of a secondary haemorrhage. He was 62.

His final appearance was in the television mini-series &quot;QB VII&quot;. His autobiography, &quot;Anything for a Quiet Life&quot;, was published after his death. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Golders Green Crematorium in north London.

<text>Chicano rap is a subgenre of hip hop that embodies aspects of the Mexican American or Chicano culture.

==History==
===Early years===
The first recognized Chicano rap album was the 1990 debut album &quot;Hispanic Causing Panic&quot; by Kid Frost; the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;La Raza&quot;, which combined East L.A. and Tex-Mex elements, was a hit song and became an &quot;East L.A. anthem. His success brought attention to Chicano rappers on the West Coast.

===1990s===
In 1990, A.L.T. released the album &quot;Another Latin Timebomb&quot;, featuring his hit remake of the song &quot;Tequila&quot;. In 1990, the Chicano hip hop group A Lighter Shade of Brown released their album &quot;Brown &amp; Proud&quot;, which included hits &quot;On a Sunday Afternoon&quot; (a top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and &quot;Latin Active&quot;. Rap group Cypress Hill (One Cuban, One Puerto Rican), would sometimes use popular Chicano slang and culture in their music and videos.  The lead rapper, B-Real, was of Mexican descent. Cypress Hill has also collaborated with another Chicano group, Psycho Realm. Chicano rap derives from American rap which bases its music on drum beats, jazz music, and bass amongst others. Early influences for Chicano rap include &quot;oldies&quot;, funk music and later incorporated conjunto and banda. Stemming from a long culture of &quot;mestizaje&quot;, Chicano rap uses samples from a wide range of music. Chicano can differentiate itself by sometimes having acoustic guitars playing Spanish melodies in the background or intros with Mexican regional music beats. Chicano Rap can be distinguished by sometimes having both English and Spanish verses. Some of the common themes within Chicano rap include but are not limited to: Love, experiences of being Mexican in the United States of America, Political problems, inequality, but also drug usage and money. Chicano rap often include narratives that include gang violence and life in the varrio, by using lyrics in &#x27;Spanglish&#x27;, Chicano rap embraces the reality of being Mexican-American.

During the late 1980s and 90s Chicano rap was brought by artist who shared their personal experiences through their lyrics.

In the mid-1990s, Eazy-E formed the group Brownside. Consisting of members Wicked, Klever, and Trouble, Brownside was essentially the Chicano equivalent of N.W.A.  Drawing their experiences in society into their music, Brownside illustrated the harsh realities of life and the Chicano experience.

During the 1990s, some Chicano rappers such as Sinful of the Mexicanz began using influences from Mexican music in their beats and delivery, although this subgenre of music is sometimes referred to today as &quot;urban regional&quot; and not always representative of Chicano rap. The hip hop group Akwid also combines traditional Mexican regional music with hip hop vocals.

Starting from the release of his 1995 album, &quot;Smile Now, Die Later,&quot; Kid Frost began to include the issues of immigration and drug trafficking related to the US-Mexico border by incorporating the sound of &quot;narcocorridos&quot; into his raps, further establishing the connection between Mexican folk music and Chicano rap.

===2000s - present===
Thump Records, Urban Kings Music and Low Profile Records introduced new Chicano rap artists. New artists include Ms Krazie, Knight Owl, Chino Grande, and Mr. Sancho. Charlie Row Campo released &quot;Stop Studio Gangstas&quot; album in 2007. One of the most widely recognized Chicano rappers today is Lil Rob of San Diego, his album &quot;Natural High/High Till I Die&quot; sold 90,000 copies and his single &quot;Summer Nights&quot; was considered a major crossover and received heavy rotation on radio stations and video programs not directly related to Chicano rap music. This widely successful artist has recently reappeared in the limelight, with the song Summer Nights being used in TikTok trends, and even being sampled in Destiny Roger&#x27;s 2022 hit by the same name. Another widely known Chicano rapper is Serio of Los Angeles, with his 2012 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate Me Because I&#x27;m Mexican&quot; featuring Proper Dos and Conejo, a controversial song that called for immigration reform.

A Chicano rap scene has also begun to emerge in Texas. Prominent Texan artists in the genre include South Park Mexican (SPM) and Dope House Records. SPM&#x27;s sound includes influences similarly seen in the scene of West Coast Chicano rap: Latin beats, gangsta narratives, and G-Funk, however SPM differentiates itself by including sounds and vocabulary unique to the Houston hip hop scene with the newly added influence of corporate rap.
Many Chicano rappers have been heavily influenced by Mexican history, including many themes relevant to the Mexican and Chicano people living in the United States and Mexico. Chicano rap is mainly enjoyed by hip hop listeners in the United States, but also has established a cult fan base in Australia and the Philippines. Its main audience, however, consists of Hispanics/Latinos living on the West Coast, the Southwest, and the Midwest. Chicano culture has even reached Japan, where a small minority dresses in flannels and baggy pants, drives lowriders, and listens to Chicano rap. The Chicano rap style and culture&#x27;s introduction in Japan can be attributed to Mexican-American soldiers stationed in Japan. Although there have been some concerns over cultural appropriation between these outcroppings of Chicano-style culture in other countries, comments under YouTube videos and reviews of music made by non-Chicanos has generally been positive. Many Chicanos choose to look at this outcropping as a sort of appreciation of their culture, rather than appropriation. Chicano rap&#x27;s ability to reach large audiences without mainstream airplay or media promotion is due largely in part to nationwide lowrider car tours and their accompanying concerts headlined by Chicano rappers. This environment allows Chicano rap artists to earn significant incomes through independent label releases while promoting directly to a target audience.

<doc id="974543" wikidata="Q901441" url="?curid=974543" title="Rescue Me (American TV series)">
<text>Rescue Me is an American comedy drama television series that aired on FX from July 21, 2004, to September 7, 2011. The series focuses on the professional and personal lives of a group of New York City firefighters.

The protagonist and focal point of the series is veteran New York City firefighter Tommy Gavin (Denis Leary). The series follows Tommy&#x27;s troubled family and co-workers as they deal with real-life issues, such as post-9/11 trauma or their own domestic problems. Tommy struggles with the loss of his cousin and best friend, firefighter Jimmy Keefe (James McCaffrey), as well as 59 other firefighters whom he knew who died in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Jimmy frequently visits Tommy in ghostly dreams.

Tommy is an impatient, self-loathing, hypocritical, manipulative relapsed alcoholic who suffers with severe survivor guilt and posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of 9/11. In the pilot episode, he and his wife Janet (Andrea Roth) have already separated, although they are technically still married, and Tommy has moved across the street. Most of Tommy&#x27;s actions as a firefighter are heroic and brave, but his family members and fellow firefighters view him as selfish, despite his concern for others and passion for the job.

&quot;Rescue Me&quot; was created by Leary and Peter Tolan, who also serve as executive producers and head writers, and is produced by Cloudland Company, Apostle, DreamWorks Television, and Sony Pictures Television.

==Series overview==

===Season 1===
Season 1 of &quot;Rescue Me&quot; debuted on July 21, 2004, and began by introducing the members of New York City Fire Department&#x27;s fictional Ladder Company 62—aka &quot;62 Truck&quot;—quartered with the fictional Engine Company 99 and the Chief of the 15th (later 30th) Battalion in a firehouse in northeastern Harlem, New York City. Tommy Gavin deals with the effects of the September 11, 2001, attacks, which, for him, include seeing the ghost of his cousin, Firefighter Jimmy Keefe, who died on 9/11, as well as the ghosts of various people he failed to save over the years. Gavin and his wife Janet are separated and, from across the street, he sees her begin to date again. He plans to get her back and prevent her from leaving the state with his children. Janet separated from Tommy several months prior, due to his failure to commit to his family and open up about 9/11.

15th Battalion Chief Jerry Reilly attacks a gay former firefighter in a bar after the former FDNY member speaks to the press and claims that at least 20 of the 343 men who died during the 9/11 attacks were gay. Sean Garrity begins to date one of Franco Rivera&#x27;s numerous ex-girlfriends, which leads to Franco&#x27;s discovering that he has a daughter with the woman; Rivera later takes the daughter in after the mother fatally overdoses. Tommy begins a love affair with Jimmy&#x27;s widow Sheila (a taboo among firefighters), and Probationary Firefighter Mike Silletti begins to secretly date a &quot;fat chick&quot; named Theresa (Ashlie Atkinson). Lieutenant Ken Shea, Tommy&#x27;s superior officer, deals with 9/11 by secretly writing poetry and then starts to have an affair after learning his wife is preparing to leave him anyway.

After firefighter Billy Warren dies in a fire, the city sends Laura Miles to replace him. She clashes with the men and Tommy in particular. She begins to believe that Tommy is becoming dangerous as he takes more unnecessary risks on the job. Tommy&#x27;s mistake at a fire causes injury to Franco; this coincides with Tommy&#x27;s transfer out of the house after the rest of the crew discovers he has been seeing Sheila and they&#x27;re expecting a child. In the final scene of the season finale, Tommy shows up at his wife&#x27;s house to find her and his children missing, along with everything in the house. While consuming a bottle of vodka he finds in a cupboard, he uses a baseball bat to destroy anything that&#x27;s left in the house.

===Season 2===
Season 2 premiered on June 21, 2005.

Tommy is at a new firehouse on Staten Island and his replacement at 62 Truck, Sully, becomes everyone&#x27;s favorite. While responding to a fire at an underground sex club, they discover that a &quot;woman&quot; they rescued is Sully in a black leather skirt and bustier. The next day, Sully requests a transfer because he knows the crew will never let him live that down. This clears the way for Tommy to return.

Back in the old house, Tommy shifts his focus to finding his family and dealing with his father, who took an unannounced vacation and came home with a new, wealthy wife, Jenny Ng. Sheila has a miscarriage, but lies about it to keep Tommy close. Later on, Sheila begins a relationship with a woman named Debbie who turns abusive towards her. Tommy and his brother Johnny Gavin learn that their father, Michael Gavin, had a long, ongoing affair during their childhood, which produced two children. Eventually their new-found half brother, who is a priest, is arrested after they discover he is a pedophile.

Silletti stalks his ex-girlfriend after she dumps him. Chief Jerry&#x27;s wife gradually deteriorates from Alzheimer&#x27;s, and he is forced to seek help from his estranged son before placing her in a long-term care facility. Laura and Franco begin dating, but Laura eventually leaves Franco and the firehouse. Lieutenant Shea is conned by a prostitute named Candy, resulting in his losing his entire life savings. Jenny Ng dies, but the expected financial windfall for Tommy&#x27;s father never happens. Tommy&#x27;s estranged sister Maggie re-enters the lives of Tommy and his father.

Tommy and his family reconcile for a time, but when their only son Connor is killed by a drunk driver, it is too much for Janet to handle, and she blames Tommy. Matters worsen when Johnny learns that the driver is well-connected and may not be sentenced, so Tommy&#x27;s uncle Teddy murders the man in public.

===Season 3===
Season 3 premiered on May 30, 2006.

Tommy and Janet have re-separated, and Teddy is in jail for murder. Janet begins sleeping with Johnny Gavin, and Tommy attacks Johnny at their father&#x27;s 83rd birthday dinner.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Shea, still smarting from getting conned, becomes testy with everyone on the crew and slowly spirals downward. Janet wants to talk to Tommy about their settlement, but a heated argument ignites and Tommy rapes Janet.
Mike Silletti, no longer a Probationary Firefighter, begins a sexual relationship with his male roommate, and Tommy falls back in love with Sheila. Sheila, desiring Tommy to stay away from Janet completely, begins to drug him with rohypnol and Viagra in order to rape him. Maggie soon finds herself dating Sean Garrity, among others.

Janet gets pregnant with either Johnny&#x27;s or Tommy&#x27;s baby, and announces she wants to keep it to replace Connor. The crew learns about Mike&#x27;s possible homosexuality, and Tommy comes to his defense out of fears over the fire crew breaking up. Franco starts to date Alicia (Susan Sarandon), a wealthy older woman who eventually takes his daughter from him. (He is unable to do anything about it, because he had taken her from foster care without permission and therefore is not the girl&#x27;s legal guardian.)

Lieutenant Shea moves in with Tommy and begins seeing Theresa, a soon-to-be ex-nun with whom he plans on moving to Florida to be first mate on his cousin&#x27;s boat. Chief Reilly tries to meet his wife&#x27;s increasing health care costs by taking a second job at a bar. Later, he suffers a heart attack after having sex with Karlene, an illegal Jamaican immigrant who is a caretaker at the long-term care facility where his wife now lives.

During a stakeout, Johnny is killed by someone who was contracted to stop him from testifying against a powerful drug dealer Johnny had arrested months beforehand. During his funeral, Sean and Maggie decide to get married at the cemetery. Tommy, Johnny, and Maggie&#x27;s long lost sister Rosemary Gavin is introduced; she is deaf and had been shunned by her parents, but reconciles with her father.

Uncle Teddy, still in prison, receives numerous letters from a woman named Ellie, who is proud of the action he took upon Connor&#x27;s killer. The two begin a relationship and get married, which allows Ellie to meet with him for conjugal visits.

With the 62 Truck crew seemingly breaking up, Tommy decides to retire and move in with Sheila in her new home on Long Island. He changes his mind after talking with Janet about her pregnancy and discovering that his crew will remain together after all. (Mike isn&#x27;t transferring, Lou has changed his mind about the boat after discovering he lacked &quot;sea legs&quot;, and Franco has failed a lieutenant&#x27;s exam.) Jerry defends his crew when several officials visit his firehouse.

While at Sheila&#x27;s new house, Tommy tells her he is not retiring from the FDNY. Distraught, she drugs him again and accidentally starts a fire. The fire spreads while the frantic Sheila is overwhelmed by frustration, and the finale closes without making it clear if Tommy survives.

===Season 4===
Season 4 premiered on June 13, 2007.

Tommy and Sheila are apparently rescued by volunteer firefighters, but are then accused of arson and insurance fraud. Janet has given birth, and while Tommy has come to accept it as his own, the baby&#x27;s hair finally comes in and it is &quot;jet black&quot; in color, leaving them to now believe that it is Johnny&#x27;s son, instead.

Teddy is released from prison and immediately abandons his new wife Ellie in a coffee shop. Colleen runs away from home and moves in with her boyfriend, Tony, leaving her parents enraged.

Depressed after being told that he can no longer serve in active duty due to his poor heart, Jerry takes a desk job. After using his position behind a computer to tamper with evidence, effectively clearing Tommy of the arson charges, Jerry commits suicide. As a result, the firehouse brings in a new chief.

Janet suffers from postpartum depression and is deeply affected by her inability to bond with her new son. The baby cries constantly, and his crying seems to worsen when Janet holds him. Getting wind of this, Sheila hounds Tommy about giving her the baby, offering $500,000 in payment. Seeing how his wife is suffering, how the baby is being neglected and seemingly rejected by everyone in the family but himself, Tommy reluctantly begins to reconsider Sheila&#x27;s offer.

Tommy decides to give the baby to Sheila after contemplating dumping him into the Hudson River at the request of Johnny&#x27;s ghost. After Tommy confesses this to Janet, she leaves with their youngest daughter Kathy. Janet sends Katy up to Sheila&#x27;s apartment to steal the baby back. Meanwhile, Tommy has a breakdown in which all of his ghostly visitors, including Jimmy, tell him they are fed up with his selfishness.

Tommy then shares custody with Sheila by bribing his daughter Colleen with a no limit credit card. Colleen gives the baby to Tommy whenever she has him, so he can in turn give him to Sheila. After Tommy learns that Colleen&#x27;s boyfriend, Tony, used the credit card to buy a wedding ring, Tommy attacks him in his recording studio. Tony tells Tommy the ring wasn&#x27;t for Colleen, but for another girl. Relieved, Tommy apologizes to Tony and wishes him and his new girlfriend the best of luck. When Tony explains this to Colleen, he says he left her because Tommy scares him, which makes Colleen hate Tommy even more.

Maggie Gavin and Sean Garrity are on-again and off-again throughout the season, with Garrity pretending to be an alcoholic like Maggie to spend more time with her, leading to the two divorcing.

The Gavin family starts their own AA meetings due to the high number of alcoholics in the family. Michael Gavin, Tommy&#x27;s father, refuses to attend meetings, but contacts Tommy and ironically tells him that he&#x27;s going to be sober to &quot;keep his friends close and his enemies closer.&quot;

Tommy also begins seeing a woman named Valerie (Gina Gershon), who can&#x27;t be touched after she orgasms. She and Tommy are on and off due to Tommy&#x27;s periodic desire for his ex-wife Janet. Janet has taken a job, where she begins dating her much-younger boss.

A new firefighter named Bart joins the house, after Lou and Franco negotiated to get him for their basketball team. Bart says he goes by his nickname, Shawn, so the crew decides to call him &quot;Black Shawn&quot; to distinguish him from Sean Garrity. Black Shawn is not happy with this. Using the basketball team as leverage, Shawn expects to not be referred to as &quot;Probie&quot; and to be absolved of any probie work. This initially angers Garrity, Mike, and Tommy. However, after Black Shawn shows himself worthy in the face of a raging fire, the entire crew accepts him, and even Tommy pays him grudging respect.

The season concludes with Tommy, Lou, Sean, Michael Gavin, and Uncle Teddy attending a Newark Bears minor league baseball game at the request of Michael while Colleen attends a picnic with Black Shawn. Tommy tries to show Michael a hit, but he doesn&#x27;t respond. Tommy realizes that his father has died, wraps his arm around him, and continues to watch the game.

===Minisodes===

On June 23, 2008, webisodes seasons premiered on Crackle and between shows on FX. Ten episodes aired.

The webisodes are largely stand-alone pieces, often showing the group in action rescuing people in fires, dream-like scenarios (such as Tommy imagining a night out with his various romantic interests), or general slice of life scenes set inside the station house.

One story depicts Truck 62 in the moments before the fire crew left the station to respond to the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.

===Season 5===
The series was renewed for a fifth season of 22 episodes. Michael J. Fox joined the cast, playing Janet&#x27;s new love interest.

Conspiracy theories swarm Truck 62, especially from Franco, which lead to tensions within and outside Truck 62. Tommy and Lou vie for the affections of the woman (Karina Lombard) who is writing a 9/11 story. Silletti gets insurance money and an inheritance following his mother&#x27;s death in season 4, and is convinced by Franco and Garrity to invest it in a bar. The bar becomes a popular after-hours place for the fire crew.

Garrity suffers renal carcinoma and requires surgery, forcing him to reunite with his estranged mother and brother. Damian, Sheila and Jimmy&#x27;s son, finishes training and joins the firehouse as a probie. A woman named Kelly (Maura Tierney) rushes into a fire that the crew is fighting and retrieves a mysterious metal suitcase. Tommy appears to shun both Janet and Sheila to spend time with Kelly. While there are some romantic undertones, Tommy is more interested in why the suitcase was so important to Kelly.

Candy (Milena Govich), the prostitute who conned Lou in season 2, reappears after being released from jail, claiming that she has turned her life around. After Lou&#x27;s vehement dismissals, he lets her move in with him. After Candy claims to have inherited a large sum of money, they marry, combining their assets. A brief time later, Lou discovers that Candy&#x27;s real name is Barbara Callahan, and she is wanted in Florida for fraud. He empties their joint bank account, taking back the money she stole from him, including interest, and confronts her. When Barbara denies the allegations, Lou tells her that he&#x27;s called the police; if she&#x27;s truly innocent, she&#x27;ll wait for them to arrive, and if guilty, she&#x27;ll run. Barbara ends up fleeing.

Tommy&#x27;s extended family — Cousin Mickey (Robert John Burke), Cousin Eddie (Terry Serpico), Uncle Teddy (Lenny Clarke), and Teddy&#x27;s wife Ellie (Patti D&#x27;Arbanville) — as they all return to drinking after spending several unsuccessful months in AA. The four are drinking one night with Tommy when a drunk Ellie leaves to pick up a dog she and Teddy had adopted. Shortly after leaving, Ellie runs a red light and gets hit by an 18-wheeler, killing her instantly.

In the final episode, Janet and Sheila convince Kelly to no longer see Tommy, and lie to her about something Tommy didn&#x27;t do. Enraged over losing a positive relationship with Kelly, Tommy threatens Sheila and breaks up with her. After Tommy and Lou &quot;kidnap&quot; Katy from Janet as revenge for the incident with Kelly, the two and the crew of Ladder 62 go to their bar. Teddy eventually arrives and blames Ellie&#x27;s death on Tommy. Teddy proceeds to shoot Tommy twice in the shoulder, leaving him to bleed to death, and threatens to kill anyone who tries to leave and seek help.

===Season 6===
Season 6 premiered on June 29, 2010. Tommy is miraculously saved and during his ambulance ride to the hospital, experiences a vision of going to hell. Tommy subsequently vows to change his ways, to stop drinking, and to be a better person, firefighter, father, and husband.

Janet alerts Tommy that Colleen, now 21-years-old, is becoming an alcoholic, leading Tommy to take drastic measures. Janet also seeks to force Tommy to permanently sever ties with Sheila, as Sheila uses her son Damian and his position in Tommy&#x27;s fire crew as leverage to continue their affair, even as she begins to date Tommy&#x27;s ex-priest cousin Mickey. Tommy and Janet reconnect, even as their daughter Katy threatens to disown them after she is accepted into a private boarding school away from the city.

Engine Company 99/Ladder Company 62 Firehouse is targeted for closure due to citywide budget cuts, which would leave the community it serves without any fire and emergency rescue services. This causes a major power struggle to break out between Battalion Chief &quot;Needles&quot; Nelson and his superior, Battalion (later Deputy) Chief Feinberg. Feinberg is accused by Needles of betraying the firefighters under him, as it appears Feinberg has made a corrupt bargain that will give him command over another existing house, nearby Engine Company 333/Ladder Company 74, in exchange for allowing his station to be shut down (and his men laid off and/or transferred).

Taking matters into his own hands, Needles video-records Tommy and the crew rushing to the aid of deaf children when a fire breaks out at the community school, while the firefighters are all off-duty. The first fire company arrives late to the scene, long after Needles&#x27; crew has saved the children. Needles promptly uses the video to blackmail his and Feinberg&#x27;s superiors into saving the house from any budget shutdowns, earning Needles the praise of his underlings, and exposing Feinberg&#x27;s disdain for Tommy and the rest of the rank and file firefighters.

Damian — who had begun to have doubts about being a firefighter, only to be talked into continuing by Tommy — suffers a traumatic head injury while fighting a fire, which leaves him severely brain-damaged and unable to walk or communicate. The strain of dealing with her son&#x27;s incurable condition breaks up Sheila and Mickey&#x27;s relationship. Amidst Tommy trying to balance both Sheila and Janet, Janet reminds him that Damian is not his responsibility, and that he should be more concerned with his own children. Tommy realizes he needs to be more proactive and committed if he is going to change his ways.

===Season 7===
The seventh and final season of the series premiered on Wednesday, July 13, 2011.

Tommy confronts Janet about her pregnancy, and is told that the only way she will have the child is if Tommy retires from the FDNY and takes a safer job. Janet is supported by Sheila, and the two women bond together over their shared grief of losing a son (despite Damian not being dead).

Tommy&#x27;s stress about his job is exacerbated when Colleen and Black Shawn become engaged. Tommy&#x27;s frustrations get the better of him during an interview about 9/11 and Jimmy, who is the subject of a hero piece. Tommy hurls obscene gestures and expletives at the reporter and leaves the interview. Enraged by the interview, Franco looks to move beyond 62 Truck before his own life becomes too tainted and feuds with Needles and Tommy.

The reporter for Tommy&#x27;s interview begins hanging around the building and digging through the past of the guys on 62 Truck for more stories. After the crew realizes the sheer volume of bad press this would generate, Tommy reaches out to Johnny&#x27;s old contacts at the police department. He manages to obtain a video of the reporter performing oral sex on another officer after being busted with cocaine, which Sheila uses to scare her off.

After hearing about other firefighters writing letters to their family members in case they died in the line of duty, Tommy writes letters to his family and the guys, and gives them to Lou to hand them out if he dies. Lou reads his immediately and is busted by Tommy, having set him up to steal a box of cupcakes he had stowed under his bunk for Janet. Due to increasing pressure from the crew (who had to fake Lou&#x27;s physical for him), Lou starts a weight-loss regimen, and Tommy promises that if Lou loses weight he will make him the godfather of their new child. Lou struggles with his diet, and eventually lashes out at Tommy that food is how he copes with the hole that 9/11 created in him and that Tommy simply filled his hole with booze instead.

Tommy writes Lou another, legitimate letter and gives it to him. Lou reads it and is moved to tears by his friend. Lou gives Sheila and Janet their letters, as they were angry with Tommy at the time, and both start being much kinder to Tommy. However, the letter Janet received was written by Lou, who accidentally burned the real one, and it promises that Tommy would quit the FDNY for her, unbeknownst to Tommy.
Colleen and Black Shawn finally marry. During the wedding reception, a drunken Sheila suggests Tommy and Janet renew their vows, which Colleen and Katy second. Tommy is blindsided when Janet adds a new vow of him promising to retire from active duty, and take an administrative or training job. Tommy hesitates, but after Katy threatens to start drinking and become a prostitute, he agrees to take Janet&#x27;s vow.
During one of Tommy&#x27;s last tours of duty as a firefighter, Engine 99 and Ladder 62 respond to a warehouse fire that quickly escalates. Both Chief Feinberg and Chief Nelson take command and call for a fourth alarm. The men see hanging latex gloves and the smell of diesel fuel, realizing they are in the middle of an arson attempt. After reaching a window to escape, they hear voices of kids still inside. They locate the kids but are unable to reach the ladder, and try to make for the roof. However, the door to the roof has been bricked over, trapping them inside. The chauffeur firefighter of Ladder 62, Niels Jorgensen, reports he can&#x27;t rescue the men from the outside and has to leave the roof before it collapses. Tommy is about to leave the group and look for another route out after Lou tells him to go, obviously reminded about his vow to Janet. Tommy asks if Lou is sure, and Lou replies, &quot;We&#x27;ll be fine, trust me.&quot; Seconds later, a massive explosion guts the building.
The series finale begins with Lou eulogizing Tommy, Franco, Sean, Black Shawn, and Mike during a joint funeral with family, friends, and many other firefighters. This all turns out to be Tommy&#x27;s dream. Tommy becomes acting Lieutenant, and while filling out a department report for Needles on that final incident, it is revealed that it was in fact only Lou who died, after having his face burned off in the fire. The recovering crew all contemplate their futures in leaving Ladder Company 62 and firefighting in general. Tommy files for retirement; Franco passes the Lieutenant&#x27;s exam awaiting reassignment; Mike and Sean consider transferring; and Black Shawn considers quitting for Colleen.

Tommy eventually finds a letter that Lou has left him in the event of his death, to be read at the scattering of his ashes. Tommy reads Lou&#x27;s letter, which tells the guys to remain together, then spreads Lou&#x27;s &quot;remains&quot;. (Lou&#x27;s ashes had to be replaced with dry cake mix after the crew had a mishap on the way.) Immediately after the service, Janet goes into labor at home, and Tommy delivers his son. After some debate over a name, Janet decides to name the baby Shea Gavin in honor of Lou. After an earlier scolding from Sheila and an incident with Wyatt at a playground involving liberal parents, Janet realizes that Tommy, regardless of everything, is not yet ready to retire.

Tommy speaks to the new academy class, but this time with more clarity and a warning not to drown their sorrows with sex, violence, and alcohol. As newly appointed Lieutenant Franco Rivera takes over, Tommy returns to his truck and converses with Lou&#x27;s ghost. The two make their peace and Tommy drives away. The episode ends with The Pogues&#x27; &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; playing as the camera pans over to the Manhattan skyline, where 1 World Trade Center&#x27;s construction progress can be seen.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
===Recurring===
==Production==
In a 2008 interview on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, Leary revealed season 5 had been delayed until March 2009 because of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, but all 22 episodes would air on consecutive weeks.

According to the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, on December 1, 2008, during an appearance at Book Soup in West Hollywood, Leary revealed plot details for season 5, specifically a retrospective look into the events leading up to and surrounding 9/11 by each of the characters.

On June 16, 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; confirmed &quot;Rescue Me&quot; would return in 2010 for a ten-episode sixth season, due to increased ratings. Season 6 premiered Tuesday, June 29 at 10 p.m. A season 6 trailer was shown Tuesday, May 11, during FX&#x27;s airing of &quot;Justified&quot;.

Framed fire-themed illustrations from Las Vegas firefighter Allan Albaitis (now retired) appeared in seven seasons of &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, generally visible on background walls of main characters and displayed in offices of fire HQs.

==Music==

The main title theme song for &quot;Rescue Me&quot; is a shortened version of &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; by The Von Bondies. That and several other songs were picked by Leary&#x27;s son. The underscore and end title theme for the show were scored by composer Christopher Tyng, who also scored Leary&#x27;s previous television series &quot;The Job&quot;.

&quot;Rescue Me&quot; often ends with a musical montage. The official soundtrack was released on May 30, 2006, on Nettwerk.

Michael Lombardi&#x27;s band, Apache Stone, performed several times on the show, although they do not appear on the soundtrack.

==Reception==
The show was well received when it premiered. The series premiere garnered Denis Leary and Peter Tolan an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Tolan also received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series. Leary received another Emmy nomination the next year, this time for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Critics praised the show&#x27;s willingness to take risks and talk about family, depression, alcoholism, homophobia, and the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The debut episode was seen by almost 4.1 million viewers, ranking #8 all-time for series premieres in basic cable. Seasons 1 and 2 averaged 2.7 and 2.8 million viewers, respectively.

&quot;Rescue Me&quot; received critical acclaim, scoring 86/100, 89/100, 90/100, 85/100, 84/100, 77/100 and 73/100 on Metacritic for seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.

<text>Samuel Revans (ca. 1807 – 14 July 1888) was a New Zealand newspaper owner, entrepreneur and politician. He was the &quot;Father of Journalism in New Zealand.&quot;

==Early life==

Samuel Revans is known to have been a native of London but, as was common in the early 19th century, the day, month and even the exact year of his birth have been lost to history. He was trained as a printer, and worked in London.

==Professional life==

===Canada and England===

He then joined Henry Samuel Chapman in Canada, where they founded one of the first Canadian daily newspapers, the Montreal Daily Advertiser. Chapman returned to England in 1834, but Revans remained until 1837, when journalist indiscretions in connection with Papineau&#x27;s revolt required his hasty return to England. Chapman and Revans were to be reunited in New Zealand, where Chapman became a leading jurist. Back in England, Revans was involved in Chartist disturbances and was introduced by J. A. Roebuck to the New Zealand Company. He became secretary of the executive committee of the New Zealand Company and the editor of the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot;, which he initially printed in his London office on 21 August 1839.

===New Zealand===

Revans arrived in New Zealand on the ship &quot;Adelaide&quot; on 7 March 1840, docking at Wellington Harbour&#x27;s Port Nicholson. On 18 April of the same year, he published the second edition of the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot;, the first newspaper published in the newly settled islands. He also invested in the timber business, and established a number of farms. Gradually, he became more distant from his newspaper, leaving both the printing and the editing to his staff. He also began to question the effectiveness of Wakefield&#x27;s New Zealand Company. Eventually, his publishing business collapsed, leaving him reliant on his other properties for income.

In 1848, Revans became prominent in the newly formed Wellington Settlers&#x27; Constitutional Association, which advocated representative government. Revans&#x27; involvement was briefly interrupted by a sudden business venture – sailing to San Francisco with a cargo of timber and potatoes, which he hoped to sell to participants in the California gold rush. When this enterprise failed to meet with its expected success, Revans returned to New Zealand, where he and William Mein Smith had established a large station at Huangaroa, near modern Masterton, in Wairarapa.

==Political career==

When self-government for New Zealand was finally instituted, Revans stood in the first provincial elections and the first general election. He was successful, and represented the Wairarapa and Hawke&#x27;s Bay electorate in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and on the Wellington Provincial Council. In the 2nd New Zealand Parliament, he contested a 27 November 1856 by-election against Robert Hart in the Hutt electorate and gained 96 votes against 24 for Hart. Revans resigned on 22 March 1858. Politically, he generally supported Isaac Featherston, a prominent Wellingtonian politician, and opposed Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his son Jerningham Wakefield. Revans was known for his then-radical views on many subjects, including a strong support for republicanism.

==Death==

Samuel Revans died in relative obscurity in Greytown, Wairarapa at the age of approximately 80.

<doc id="974569" wikidata="Q315374" url="?curid=974569" title="Michael Cacoyannis">
<text>Michael Cacoyannis (; , &quot;Michalis Kakogiannis&quot;; 11 June 1922 – 25 July 2011), sometimes credited as Michael Yannis, was a Greek Cypriot theatre and film director, writer, producer, and actor. 

Much of his work was rooted in classical texts, especially those of the Greek tragedian Euripides. His most acclaimed work is the 1964 film &quot;Zorba the Greek,&quot; an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27; novel of the same name. He also directed the 1983 Broadway revival of the musical based on the film. In addition to directing, he also wrote, produced, translated, and designed dozens of stage play and opera productions.

He was nominated for an Academy Award five times, a record for any Cypriot film artist. He received Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay nominations for &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, and two nominations in the Best Foreign Language Film category for &quot;Electra&quot; (1962) and &quot;Iphigenia&quot; (1977). He received many other international accolades, including the Technical Grand Prize from the Cannes Film Festival, as well as six Palme d&#x27;Or nominations.

==Life and career==

Cacoyannis was born in 1922 in Limassol, Cyprus. His father, Sir Panayotis Loizou Cacoyannis, had been knighted in the 1936 Birthday Honours by the United Kingdom government for public services in Cyprus. His sister was the politician Stella Soulioti.

In 1939, he was sent by his father to London to become a lawyer. He graduated from law school and joined the BBC World Service, soon taking charge of its new Cyprus Service. His deputy was Beba Clerides, sister of the RAF fighter pilot and future President of Cyprus, Glafkos Clerides. However, after producing Greek-language programmes for the BBC World Service during World War II, he ended up at the Old Vic school, and enjoyed a brief stage career there under the name Michael Yannis before he began working on films. After having trouble finding a directing job in the British film industry, Cacoyannis moved to Athens in 1952, and in 1953 he made his first film, &quot;Windfall in Athens&quot;.

He was offered the chance to direct Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando in the film &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, but he declined. Between 1959 and 1967, he was in a relationship with Yael Dayan, a progressive Israeli politician and author. Cacoyannis translated some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; into Greek, and Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Bacchae&quot; into English. 

Cacoyannis died on 25 July 2011 in Athens, aged 89.

<text>Wolf Krakowski (born 1947) is a Polish-Canadian Yiddish-speaking songwriter, singer, and guitarist. He was born at Saalfelden Farmach, an Austrian camp for displaced persons, where his parents, who were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust in Russia, lived for a short while after World War II. Soon afterwards they moved to Sweden, and the small town of Eskilstuna, where the family stayed until 1954 when they moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

As a young man Krakowski took to the road, working with the Conklin and Garrett Shows carnival and later toured for some time with blues-singer Big Joe Williams. He worked with street theatre, and as a carpenter and guitar-builder for many years. In 1994-1995 he worked as a videographer for the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, documenting the testimonies of over one hundred Holocaust survivors. In 1996 he released the CD &quot;Transmigrations/Gilgul&quot; on his own record label, &quot;Kame&#x27;a Media&quot;. On this record he presented traditional Yiddish songs in a blues–rock–reggae vein. Among the traditional songs and credited compositions Krakowski reshaped here were: &quot;Shabes, Shabes&quot;, &quot;Friling&quot; (Springtime) and &quot;Zol Shoyn Kumen Di Geule&quot; (Let the Redemption Come), all sung by Krakowski in his first language, Yiddish. On this record, and on those that followed, he was accompanied by The Lonesome Brothers, starring roots-rock veterans, multi-instrumentalist Jim Armenti and bass guitarist Ray Mason.

Krakowski made a considerable impact in world music circles with this record, and the rights to it were taken over some years later by the well-known avant-garde recording company Tzadik, led by saxophonist John Zorn, who in 2002 released Krakowski&#x27;s second CD in Yiddish: &quot;Goyrl: Destiny&quot;.

Between these records, Krakowski himself also released the CD &quot;Unbounded&quot; (on Kamea Media), on which he sings some of his own songs in English. In 2006, Krakowski and Jim Armenti produced the CD &quot;Di Alte Kashe&quot; (The Eternal Question: Fraidy Katz Sings Yiddish), also on Kame&#x27;a Media.

Krakowski lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, United States.

<text>Earle Alfred Birney (13 May 1904 – 3 September 1995) was a Canadian poet and novelist, who twice won the Governor General&#x27;s Award, Canada&#x27;s top literary honour, for his poetry.

==Life==
Born in Calgary in the North-West Territories&#x27; District of Alberta, and raised on a farm in Erickson, near Creston, British Columbia, his childhood was somewhat isolated. After working as a farm hand, a bank clerk, and a park ranger, Birney went on to college to study chemical engineering but graduated with a degree in English. He studied at the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, University of California, Berkeley and University of London. During his year in Toronto he became a Marxist–Leninist. Through a brief and quickly annulled marriage to Sylvia Johnston, he was introduced to Trotskyism. In the 1930s he was an active Trotskyist in Canada, the United States and Britain and was the leading figure in the Socialist Workers League but disagreed with the Trotskyist position on World War II and left the movement.

During the conflict, he served as a personnel officer in the Canadian Army (an experience that he used in his 1949 novel, &quot;Turvey&quot;).

In 1946, Birney began teaching at the University of British Columbia, &quot;where he founded and directed the first Canadian creative writing programme.&quot; His work led to the establishment of Canada&#x27;s first Department of Creative Writing at UBC.

In 1995, Birney died of a heart attack.

==Writing==
===Fiction===
Birney&#x27;s World War II experiences inspired the creation of the title character of his comic military novel, &quot;Turvey&quot; (1949), a saga of one hapless soldier&#x27;s struggle to get to &#x27;the sharp end&#x27; of the fighting in the Netherlands and Germany during 1944–45. The character of Turvey is a fascinating melange of country boy innocent, common sense utilitarian and town fool, and seems to have been fashioned as a foil to the eccentrically pseudo-sophisticated Canadian military life as illustrated in the novel. The book has been described as &quot;uproariously ribald&quot;, winning the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour. &quot;Turvey&quot; was a hit in Canada, selling 30,000 copies.

Birney published his second novel, &quot;Down the Long Table&quot;, a Marxist novel about the Great Depression, in 1955. It did not match the first novel&#x27;s success.

===Poetry===
Beginning with &quot;David and Other Poems&quot; (1942), was published during his tenure at the University of Toronto. Birney&#x27;s poetry consistently explored the resources of language with passionate and playful curiosity. That first volume won Birney a Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1942. The title work, &quot;a poem about euthanasia, became quite a controversial poem, frequently anthologized and taught in Canadian literature courses.&quot; &quot;A generation of Canadian schoolchildren and university students has grown up knowing the story,&quot; Al Purdy wrote in 1974. &quot;At one time or another in the last 25 years, &quot;David&quot; has been required reading for high schools and universities in every Canadian province.&quot;

His second book of poetry, &quot;Now Is Time&quot;, won Birney a second Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1945.

By the time of Birney&#x27;s &quot;Trial of a City and other Verse&quot; in 1952, literary critic Northrop Frye was calling him one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s two leading poets&quot; (the other being E. J. Pratt).

The Royal Society of Canada awarded Birney its Lorne Pierce Medal for literature in 1953.

In the mid-1960s Birney collaborated with electronic composer Terry Rusling on CBC Radio. A poem was performed combined with electronic music and afterwards they discussed their respective work and experimental approaches.

Birney&#x27;s typography became increasingly more experimental during the 1960s, and in his 1966 &quot;Selected Poems&quot; he revised many of his older poems, dropping punctuation and sentence structure. He explained his reasoning in the preface to that book:

In 1970 Birney was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

In 1974, Birney was still being called &quot;one of the two best poets in Canada,&quot; this time by Al Purdy (the other being Irving Layton).

In 1982 Birney recorded &quot;Nexus &amp; Earle Birney&quot;, a triple-album collaboration with avant-garde percussion group Nexus.

&quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; sums up: &quot;In long poems and lyrics, sight poems, sound poems and found poems, whether on the page or in his collection of recorded poems with the percussion ensemble NEXUS (1982), Birney demonstrated his deep commitment to making language have meaning in every possible and eloquent way.&quot;

<doc id="974597" wikidata="Q1245452" url="?curid=974597" title="Via Aquitania">
<text>The Via Aquitania was a Roman road created in 118 BC in the Roman province of Gaul. It started at Narbonne, where it connected to the &quot;Via Domitia&quot;. It then went toward the Atlantic Ocean, via Toulouse and Bordeaux, covering approximately .

==Founding==
Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, along with Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, successfully defeated the Allobroges and Arverni tribes in Gaul in 121 BC. This eliminated almost all opposition to the Romans in southern Gaul. Some portions of the coast were still controlled by local tribes, but this did not hinder trade. Rome received tribute from Gauls all the way to Toulouse. Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus later served as proconsul in Gaul. In 118 BC, he founded the town of Narbo Martius, modern-day Narbonne, and built the &quot;Via Domitia&quot; to make travel to Spain easier. The &quot;Via Aquitania&quot; is an offshoot of the &quot;Via Domitia&quot; that goes through southwestern Gaul into the province of Aquitania. It is unknown who commissioned the &quot;Via Aquitania&quot;, but it is likely that Domitius Ahenobarbus built it in order to easily exact tributes from the newly conquered tribes.

==Route==
The &quot;Via Aquitania&quot; was the main Roman road in the province of Aquitania. The province of Aquitania is located in southwestern Gaul. It is bordered on the south and east by the Pyrenees, on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the north by the Loire River. The &quot;Via Aquitania&quot; begins in Narbonne, where it connects to the Via Domitia. Narbonne was the first Roman colony in Gaul. Its purpose was to be an agricultural colony. Narbonne later became an important trade hub in the time of Augustus. During the Pax Romana, traveling became safer. This led to an increase in trade.

In addition to Narbonne, two other important cities, Toulouse and Bordeaux, were situated along the &quot;Via Aquitania&quot;. The &quot;Via Aquitania&quot; was the main trade route which connected the Atlantic seaways to Toulouse and Narbonne. At Toulouse, the Via Aquitania intersected with roads leading north to Lyon, which was a main intersection of Gallic roads. Toulouse later became the Visigoth capital. The Via Aquitania ended in Burdigala, modern-day Bordeaux. Bordeaux was an important international trade city, due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. After Gaul was divided into the three provinces of Aquitania, Belgica, and Lugdunensis, Bordeaux became the capital of Aquitania. The Via Aquitania connected these important cities in southern Gaul.

<doc id="974604" wikidata="Q6840854" url="?curid=974604" title="Mid-air retrieval">
<text>Mid-air retrieval is a technique used in atmospheric reentry when the reentering vehicle is incapable of a satisfactory unassisted landing. The vehicle is slowed by means of parachutes, and then a specially-equipped aircraft matches the vehicle&#x27;s trajectory and catches it in mid-air.

This is a risky technique, and so is only used when other forms of landing are infeasible. Successful mid-air retrieval requires correct operation of the retrieving aircraft, favourable atmospheric conditions, and successful execution of a tricky manoeuvre, in addition to correct operation of the vehicle itself. These risks can be mitigated somewhat: for example, multiple recovery aircraft can be used. The need for human aviators to perform a manoeuvre which would normally be classed as a stunt may in the future be avoided by advances in unmanned aerial vehicles and spacecraft reentry.

Notable uses of the technique:
* The first use of midair retrieval was in 1955, with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar transports being used to recover Ryan AQM-34 Firebee target drones during test flights. On operational flights, the Firebee used Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters as its recovery aircraft. 
*The early-1960s era Corona reconnaissance satellite returned delicate film capsules to Earth that required mid-air retrieval by a specially modified aircraft. Early in the program, modified C-119 Flying Boxcar airlifters were used, replaced in 1961 by modified JC-130B Hercules and supplemented in 1966 with JC-130H]]. These aircraft were manned by a crew of 10 personnel. The crew consisted of two pilots, one flight engineer, two telemetry operators, one winch operator, and four riggers. The telemetry operators would acquire the location of the satellite and relay the info to the pilots. Once visually acquired the pilots would head on course to the satellite descending towards the Pacific Ocean. One could visually acquire the satellite and its parachute at an altitude of approximately 50,000 ft. The winch operator and the riggers would deploy the retrieving apparatus called the &quot;Loop&quot;, which consisted of high quality nylon rope with a series of brass hooks spliced into the apparatus. The whole snatching operation by the pilots was done visually. The winch operator and the four riggers would deploy the loop. Once contact was made between the parachute and the loop the winch line would pay out and stop. The winch then was put into gear and the retrieval process commenced. Once on board, the aircraft flew back to Hickam Air Force Base, where they were stationed, where the satellite or canister was offloaded onto a truck and then loaded immediately onto a running C-141 airlifter and then transported to a location in Maryland for analysis. The crews acquired these skills by practicing almost daily on practice missions, carried out with other aircraft dropping dummy bombs with chutes attached. The weights were 200 lb. in the early 70s and later to the conical parachute system which weighed in at 1,100 lb.
* The Soviet Union also experimented with midair recovery during drone trials at the Gromov Flight Research Institute, though they do not appear to have used this technique operationally. While little information exists on the extent of these experiments, it is known that at least one Mil Mi-8 helicopter was modified for the midair recovery role. An Antonov An-12 transport airplane was also modified for this task, possibly under the same program. 
* The Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave was used to recover the unmanned space capsules from suborbital Aerobee rocket launches at the Wallops Flight Facility and the White Sands Missile Range during the 1960s. 
* The Genesis space probe returned a sample of solar wind particles in a &quot;particle trap&quot; device that was so delicate, that it would have been damaged by a parachute landing. This task called for a plan involving a mid-air retrieval, using helicopters flown by Hollywood stunt pilots contracted by NASA. Its parachutes failed to deploy, leading to a disastrous high speed impact with the desert floor, which shattered the trap&#x27;s delicate wafers holding the solar wind particle samples. 
* An early design for SpaceShipOne called for a shuttlecock-like shape that would have made it incapable of landing independently, necessitating mid-air retrieval. This was deemed too risky, and the final design made the spacecraft capable of independent horizontal landing while retaining the desired aerodynamic qualities for the early part of reentry.
* During the Cold War, Lockheed HC-130 Hercules and Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar airlifters were used to recover film capsules ejected from unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance balloons under programs such as Project Genetrix and Project Moby Dick. 
* The Lockheed D-21 high-speed reconnaissance drone was designed to be disposable, ejecting a camera capsule at the end of its mission and then self-destructing. This capsule would then be recovered in midair by a JC-130B Hercules. However, the D-21 met with very little success, and only a handful of missions were successfully recovered. 
* The ALARR (Air Launched, Air Recoverable Rocket), an upper-atmosphere research drone developed from the AIR-2 Genie air-to-air missile, was launched from an F-4 Phantom fighter, and then recovered in midair by a C-130 Hercules using the same technique used for the Corona satellites, spy balloons, and the D-21. 
* The United Launch Alliance&#x27;s proposed Vulcan rocket was at one point intended to have the main engines on its first stage recovered in midair by helicopter so that it can be reused for further launches.
* NASA operated a Shorts Skyvan airplane nicknamed the “Ugly Hooker”, which was used for several years to recover instrument packages ejected from sounding rockets and high-altitude research balloons.
* The Dynetics X-61 reconnaissance drone is intended to be launched from a carrier aircraft and recovered in midair after their mission by a modified C-130 Hercules, using a device similar to that previously used to recover film capsules from spy satellites. On the X-61&#x27;s first flight, on January 17, 2020, the drone&#x27;s main parachute failed to open, and the midair recovery failed, resulting in the loss of the drone. Subsequent test flights have resulted in successful retrievals. 
*US-New Zealand aerospace company Rocket Lab has announced plans to recover their Electron rocket for reuse by helicopter. The first successful midair recovery of an Electron booster was made on 3 May 2022, using a Sikorsky S-92 as the recovery aircraft.

<text>Ahmad Zahir (Pashto/Dari: ; 14 June 1946 – 14 June 1979) was an Afghan singer, songwriter and composer. Dubbed the &quot;Elvis of Afghanistan&quot;, he is widely considered the all-time greatest singer of Afghanistan. The majority of his songs were in Dari followed by Pashto, with a few in Russian, Hindi and English.

Zahir recorded at least 14 studio albums before his abrupt death on his 33rd birthday in 1979. His music blended folk music, Persian literature, Indian classical music and Western pop and rock styles. Among Afghans, he is considered an icon of Afghan music and is widely regarded as the single greatest musician of all time, posthumously reclaiming immortal fame due to his contributions and influence on music in Afghanistan. He has also become an icon of peacetime pre-war Afghanistan.

== Early years ==
Ahmad Zahir was born on 14 June 1946 (Jauza 24, 1325 of the Jalali calendar) in Kabul, Afghanistan, to an ethnic Pashtun family from Laghman Province. His father, Abdul Zahir, was a royal court doctor who served as Minister of Health followed by Prime Minister of Afghanistan between 1971 and 1972. He was a speaker of the parliament and an influential figure in King Zahir Shah&#x27;s era who helped write the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan. Ahmad Zahir had an older sister, Zahira Zahir, who would later be known as the hairdresser of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and others.

== Career ==
Zahir attended Habibia High School in Kabul and formed &quot;the amateur band of Habibia High School&quot; including Omar Sultan on guitar, Farid Zaland on congas, and Akbar Nayab on piano. Zahir played the accordion and sang. They performed locally during public holidays such as Nowruz, Eid ul-Fitr and Afghan Independence Day. Zahir gained considerable popularity in Kabul as a talented singer with a soulful voice. His baritone chest voice and evocative singing gave him the title of &quot;Bulbul-e- Habibya&quot;, &quot;the Nightingale of Habibia&quot;.

He attended and graduated from &quot;Daru&#x27; l-Malimeen&quot; (&quot;Teachers&#x27; College&quot;) in Kabul, and studied for two years in India to get a degree as an English instructor. After his return from India, Zahir got a job as a journalist for &quot;The Kabul Times&quot;, but soon began work on his first album. He worked closely with Afghan composers Nainawaz and Taranasaz. His first recorded song, &quot;Gar Kuni Yak Nizara&quot;, was his own composition, blending Indian raga with western pop rhythms.

Zahir worked with mentors such as Ismail Azami (saxophonist), Nangalai (trumpeter), Abdullah Etemadi (drummer), and other musicians including Salim Sarmast, Nainawaz, Taranasaz and Mashour Jamal. He recorded over 22 albums in the 1970s. His songs were noted for their mellifluous tone, poetic style, compelling depth, and passionate emotional evocation. Zahir was on the scene of Afghan music for only 10 years at the most; yet, managed to record more than 30 albums. This was and is unique in any music industry around the world. All of these albums were successful and widely accepted (to this date) by everyone. The musicians managed to complete these recordings almost 40 years ago with almost no technology of today&#x27;s world, and all was done in live recordings.

A controversy regarding the relation between his song &quot;Tanha Shodam Tanha&quot; and Claude Morgan&#x27;s song &quot;El Bimbo&quot; (1974) exists. Some sources date the song and the album &quot;Lylee&quot; on which it appeared to 1971, which would make Morgan&#x27;s version a cover, and some (mostly based on a previous version of this article) date it to 1977, reversing the relationship.

Because of his musical family background, Zahir helped to establish music as a more respected profession which in turn led to the founding of The Kabul Music School in 1974.

Following the Saur Revolution, Zahir criticized the leaders of the new communist regime in three songs in resistance to their oppression, modelling himself after one of his heroes, John Lennon, who used rock music for anti-war resistance in the west.

=== Musical style and contributions ===

Of all the Afghan musicians, the person most closely associated with creating the distinct Afghan sound of music is Ahmad Zahir. After the great Afghan singer Sarban, Zahir played the most vital role in the development of the Afghan musical style. Highly educated, well-travelled, and an extraordinarily gifted musician, Zahir had an overwhelming passion for music and arts since his early childhood. He learned to play various musical instruments including the harmonium, guitar, and accordion (his favourite instrument) by the time he was 16 years old. His privileged and affluent background (his father, Abdul Zahir, was an ambassador, a minister, and later the Prime Minister of Afghanistan) gave him the opportunity to travel and become exposed to the burgeoning musical revolution of the 60s and 70s occurring in the United States, Europe, and India. He was an avid listener of all genres of music and he incorporated elements of western (pop, rock, jazz), Indian, Middle Eastern (Arabic, Iranian), European (French and Italian belle chanson, Spanish Flamenco), and Afghan Folk in his songs.

Although the distinct Afghan sound (as opposed to the Indian classical, folkloric Afghan music, and western music) was created by the Persian singer Sarban in partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Zahir was the one who popularized the sound and took it to the masses. Sarban&#x27;s songs such as Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man, Ay Sarban, Mushjke Taza Mebartad, Dar Daaman-e-Sahra, are considered the pearls of Afghan Persian music. However, the sombre poetry, complex music &amp; numerous other subtleties of these songs could be appreciated only by a minority of highly educated and erudite Afghans. The songs were not popular items of entertainment for the consumption of the common man. Ahmad Zahir simplified the lyrical, compositional, and orchestral aspects of Sarban and Sarmast&#x27;s musical tradition. This does not mean he made the style simplistic, but that he made it accessible and thus hugely popular to the masses, especially the youth of Afghanistan. For instance Zahir&#x27;s song &quot;Khoda Buwat Yaret&quot; is a great example of an unmistakably Afghan musical sound. The lyrics of the song are understandable by almost all Persian speakers regardless of their education and knowledge of Persian poetic tradition, yet the poeticism, imagery, and emotional impact is as powerful as the best of Sarban&#x27;s songs. As a result of this accessibility of Ahmad Zahir&#x27;s songs, the vast majority of future Afghan singers who sang in the unique Afghan style were influence primarily by Ahmad Zahir and not Sarban (whose songs few had heard). Thus, Zahir can truly be credited as the singer responsible for the realization of a unique and distinct Afghan musical language—separate from the Indian, Iranian, western, and folkloric musical traditions.

Zahir&#x27;s debut album was recorded with Radio Kabul. It is the first Afghan album that falls in the western genre of music, consisting mostly of pop songs. However, although the rhythms, melody lines, and texture of songs were identifiably Afghan pop, there was a prominent Afghan (or rather eastern) element to them to—rather than use drums, Zahir opted for the tabla to hold the rhythm of the songs. Zahir&#x27;s favourite instrument, the accordion (a western albeit not pop instrument) heavily features in this album. The most popular song of this album was &quot;Az Ghamat Ay Nazanin.&quot;

However, it was Zahir&#x27;s second album (also recorded with Radio Kabul) that not only shot him to superstardom, but was also hailed by critics as an artistic masterpiece. The album has a distinctly Afghan sound, very much a continuation of the distinct Afghan style of music created by the singer Sarban and Salim Sarmast. However, unlike the music of the Sarban &amp; Sarmast duo (which were highly erudite lyrically &amp; complex musically), Zahir&#x27;s album retains the main elements of the Afghan sound but with a very popular and easily accessible lyrical and musical language. Songs like Hama Yaranam, Rozo Shabam (which is a collaboration with the great Afghan singer Nashenas), Tanha tuyere, and Tora Afsoone Chashmanam were hugely popular due to their easily accessible lyrics (mainly to the youth) and a sound that suited the Afghan musical palate perfectly.

Other Zahir albums and songs mostly continue the musical style of this album with songs like Agar Bahar Beyayad, Laili Lail Jan, Khuda buwat Yaret. Zahir was one of the first Afghan musicians not to shy away from covering great songs of other artists. He considered covering music of other artists as paying homage to their artistic brilliance. He covered a playback of the famous Indian film Bobby (which was a hit in Afghanistan at the time), Iranian songs (Sultan-e Qalbha, Hargez Hargez, Hamash Dardo Hamash Ranjo), and even some of the greats of the west Enrico Macias, Elvis Presley. This versatility and willingness to adopt musical creations of others for his own performance, greatly enhanced the merit of his own musical creations.

== Assassination ==
Ahmad Zahir was assassinated by unknown gunman from the top of a mountain on June 14, 1979, on his 33rd birthday. It was reported in the media that he was killed in a car accident around the Salang Tunnel, but some claim he was assassinated because his political stance was at odds with the Marxist government of the time; supposedly he was lured out the city by a close friend and two female accomplices and subsequently murdered. Others believe that he was murdered on the order of senior politician Hafizullah Amin or that of Amin&#x27;s trusted aide Daoud Taroon due to an affair between Zahir and Amin&#x27;s daughter. A large crowd of mourners attended Zahir&#x27;s funeral in Kabul, clogging the city streets and bringing daily activities to a halt. 
He left behind a son, Rishad, from his first wife Najia, who he eventually divorced.

==Legacy==
After his death, Zahir was considered a national hero. His tomb was destroyed by members of the Taliban in the late 1990s, but was later rebuilt by loving fans. It was renovated as recently as 2018 by fans who have established a foundation in his name in hopes of continuing his legacy.

His songs &quot;Khuda Buwad Yaret&quot;, &quot;Asman Khalist&quot;, &quot;Agar Bahar Beyayad&quot;, &quot;Laili Laili Jan&quot;, &quot;Chashme Siya Dari&quot;, &quot;Zim Zim (Kajaki Abroyet)&quot; and many others, are known by the vast majority of Afghans. They are ranked as some of the greatest songs created in Afghanistan&#x27;s musical history.

Zahir was listed as one of 50 golden voices in history who have made their mark internationally, according to National Public Radio (NPR).

The Academy Award–nominated American film director Sam French was selected in 2018 to direct a documentary film about Zahir&#x27;s life.

<doc id="974610" wikidata="Q124635130" url="?curid=974610" title="Eleutherae">
<text>Eleutherae () is a city in the northern part of Attica, bordering the territory of Boeotia. One of the best preserved fortresses of Ancient Greece stands now on the spot of an Ancient Eleutherae castle, dated between 370 and 360 BC, with walls of very fine masonry that average 2.6m thick. A circuit of wall 860 m contained towers, 6 of them still standing along the northern edge of the site, preserved to the height of 4 to 6 m. The foundations of more towers are present. Although not as well preserved, the line of the remainder of the fortification circuit is clear, as is the location of the one large, double gate (western) and one small (south-eastern) gate. There are two small sally-ports located on the north side. The fortified area is irregular and c. 113 by 290m in extent.

==History==
Eleuther, in mythology, son of Apollo and Aethusa, was regarded as the founder of Eleutherae. The feast of the Dionysia is believed to have been established throughout Greece when &quot;Eleutherae&quot; chose to become part of Attica and presented a statue of the god Dionysus to Athens. It was rejected by the Athenians, and, soon after, Athens was hit with a plague. Out of fear for Dionysus, the Athenians celebrated the &quot;Dionysia&quot; by running a procession of people carrying phalloi, and saved the city from further destruction. In the 2nd century CE, the periegetic writer Pausanias wrote:
When you have turned from Eleusis to Boeotia, you come to the Plataean land, which borders on Attica. Formerly &quot;Eleutherae&quot; formed the boundary (of Boeotia) on the side towards Attica, but when it came over to the Athenians henceforth the boundary of Boeotia was Mount Cithaeron. The reason why the people of &quot;Eleutherae&quot; came over was not because they were reduced by war, but because they desired to share Athenian citizenship and hated the Thebans. In this plain is a temple of Dionysus, from which the old wooden image was carried off to Athens. The image at &quot;Eleutherae&quot; at the present day is a copy of the old one. (Description of Greece 1.38.8)
Indeed, Eleutherae, like neighboring Plataea, was an independent &quot;polis&quot; on the border between Attica and Boeotia. Frustrated by the perennial belligerence and bullying of the Thebans, the Eleuthereans turned to Athens and volunteered to give up their independence in exchange for incorporation into the Athenian &quot;polis&quot;. Given the geopolitical significance of the town, the Athenians eventually acquiesced and the cult of &quot;Diónysos Eleuthereús&quot; (&quot;Dionysus the Liberator&quot;) was symbolically transferred to Athens. The feast of the &quot;Dionýsia&quot;, originally an Eleutherean festival in celebration of the new wine, was the event that led to the creation of what was then a completely new literary and artistic genre: the theatre; consequently, at the Theatre of Dionysus, the priest of Dionysus Eleuthereus was the principal honoree and his ornate marble throne was center-placed in the front row of the spectator seats.

Famous historical figures originate from here, such as Myron, a famous sculptor known primarily for his &quot;Discobolus&quot; (discus thrower). His son, Lycius, was also a renowned sculptor.

<text>Silver or metallic gray is a color tone resembling gray that is a representation of the color of polished silver.

The visual sensation usually associated with the metal silver is its metallic shine. This cannot be reproduced by a simple solid color because the shiny effect is due to the material&#x27;s brightness varying with the surface angle to the light source. In addition, there is no mechanism for showing metallic or fluorescent colors on a computer without resorting to rendering software that simulates the action of light on a shiny surface. Consequently, in art and in heraldry, one would typically use a metallic paint that glitters like real silver. A matte gray color could also be used to represent silver.

== History ==

The first recorded use of &quot;silver&quot; as a color name in English was in 1481. In heraldry, the word argent is used, derived from Latin &quot;argentum&quot; over Medieval French &quot;argent&quot;.

<doc id="974627" wikidata="Q5500617" url="?curid=974627" title="Freedom Road Socialist Organization">
<text>The Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) is an American communist organization. FRSO formed in 1985 as a merger of several Maoist-oriented New Communist movement organizations.

FRSO describes itself as a revolutionary socialist and Marxist-Leninist party, because capitalism &quot;cannot be reformed out of existence&quot;, so socialists must &quot;take the sledgehammer of revolution to the chains of oppression&quot;. FRSO describes itself as a Marxist-Leninist organization, working to &quot;build a new, revolutionary, communist party&quot; in the United States.

== Membership ==
FRSO has two levels of membership. &quot;General&quot; members pay dues annually and must attend one online seminar per year. &quot;Cadre&quot; members must adhere to Leninist organizational norms, including democratic centralism.

In December 2020, FRSO claimed &quot;over 500&quot; general members. In March 2021, FRSO claimed almost 1000 members and &quot;hundreds&quot; of cadre.

=== Associated groups ===
In 2002, FRSO created the Anti-War Committee (AWC), which it leads. In 2008, the AWC protested the 2008 Republican National Convention.

In 2006, FRSO helped create the new Students for a Democratic Society (SDS or &quot;new SDS&quot;), which has significant FRSO leadership and FRSO collaboration.

=== Publications ===
FRSO&#x27;s main publication is the website and monthly paper &quot;Fight Back! News&quot; (FB!N) and its Spanish section &quot;Lucha y Resiste&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1985, the Proletarian Unity League and the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters merged to create FRSO. In 1986, FRSO fused with the Organization for Revolutionary Unity. In 1988, FRSO absorbed the Amílcar Cabral-Paul Robeson Collective.

In 1993, FRSO merged with the Socialist Organizing Network (SON) and adopted the placeholder name &quot;Freedom Road Socialist Organization / Socialist Organizing Network&quot; (FRSO/SON). The SON was formed by former members of the League of Revolutionary Struggle (LRS), which had dissolved in the late 1980s. The 1994 FRSO Congress, which formalized the merger, was called the &quot;First Congress of FRSO/SON&quot;. However, no new name emerged, and FRSO/SON reverted back to FRSO afterwards.

FRSO&#x27;s component groups believed that ultraleftism was the US New Communist movement&#x27;s main error. Merging under the FRSO banner, these groups hoped to consolidate the movement&#x27;s remnants in a single organization and move beyond the sectarianism that marked the previous decades.

=== 1999 split ===

In response to Tiananmen Square and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, FRSO began to develop two distinct positions on socialist countries. The &quot;Left Refoundation&quot; group, aligned with democratic socialism, argued that these events resulted from a deep crisis of Marxism. The &quot;Fight Back!&quot; group, aligned with Marxism-Leninism, argued that these events resulted from revisionism rather than failures within Marxism. These divisions grew during the 1990s. In 1998, the Left Refoundation group wrote an internal document, &quot;Theses on Left Refoundation&quot;, and requested an organization-wide discussion. The FRSO National Executive Committee (NEC) unanimously rejected this discussion. In 1999, the Left Refoundation group received a second hearing, at which the NEC and FRSO as a whole split in two.

Both factions claimed the name &quot;Freedom Road Socialist Organization&quot;. In 2006, the Left Refoundation group renamed itself to &quot;FRSO/OSCL&quot;, combining the English and Spanish acronym. In 2019, the Left Refoundation group renamed itself to Liberation Road.

=== FBI raid ===
On September 24, 2010, over 70 FBI agents raided the homes of 6 antiwar activists, 5 of which FRSO members, and the Anti-War Committee (AWC) headquarters. The FBI claimed to be searching for evidence of &quot;material support of terrorism&quot;. FRSO formed the &quot;Committee to Stop FBI Repression&quot; and claimed that FBI agents left behind documents indicating that the raids were aimed at people suspected of FRSO membership, due to the AWC&#x27;s political support for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). FRSO further claimed that the FBI had placed informants inside its organization.

On February 26, 2014, a federal judge unsealed the extensive documents the FBI collected during its nearly three-year surveillance of FRSO. The FBI never charged any person involved.

== Ideology ==
FRSO is a Marxist-Leninist and democratic centralist organization.

In labor, FRSO advocates a strategy of the building of a &quot;militant minority&quot; within the unions and opposing &quot;collaborating union officials&quot;.

In elections, FRSO generally encourages members to tactically vote against the &quot;most reactionary&quot; candidate, usually Republicans. However, in the 2024 election, FRSO stated &quot;we don’t advocate voting for Harris as a way to oppose Trump&quot;, as a result of Harris&#x27; support for Israel bombing Palestine.

FRSO recognizes China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam as socialist countries. FRSO &quot;positively evaluates&quot; Albania, the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact countries, but argues they &quot;gave up on Marxism&quot;. FRSO also supports the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and Nicolas Maduro as &quot;leading the masses of people in building a new society&quot;. FRSO participates in the annual International Communist Seminar. FRSO is Anti-Zionist.

<doc id="974642" wikidata="Q1227044" url="?curid=974642" title="Theatre of Dionysus">
<text>The Theatre of Dionysus (or Theatre of Dionysos, ) is an ancient Greek theatre in Athens. It is built on the south slope of the Acropolis hill, originally part of the sanctuary of Dionysus Eleuthereus (Dionysus the Liberator). The first &quot;orchestra&quot; terrace was constructed on the site around the mid- to late-sixth century BC, where it hosted the City Dionysia. The theatre reached its fullest extent in the fourth century BC under the &quot;epistates&quot; of Lycurgus when it would have had a capacity of up to 25,000, and was in continuous use down to the Roman period. The theatre then fell into decay in the Byzantine era and was not identified, excavated and restored to its current condition until the nineteenth century.

==Sanctuary and first theatre==

The cult of Dionysus was introduced to Attica in the Archaic period with the earliest representation of the God dating to c. 580 BC. The City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia) began sometime in the Peisistratid era. and was reorganised during the Kleisthenic reforms of the 520s BC. The first dramatic performances likely took place in the Agora where it is recorded that the wooden bleachers set up for the plays (&quot;ikria&quot;) collapsed. This disaster perhaps prompted the removal of dramatic production to the Sanctuary of Dionysus on the Akropolis, which took place by the time of the 70th Olympiad in 499/496 BC. At the &quot;temenos&quot; the earliest structures were the Older Temple, which housed the &quot;xoanon&quot; of Dionysos, a retaining wall to the north and slightly further up the hill a circular terrace that would have been the first &quot;orchestra&quot; of the theatre. The excavations by Wilhelm Dörpfeld identified the foundations of this terrace as a section of polygonal masonry, indicating an archaic date. It is probable there was an altar, or &quot;thymele&quot;, in the centre of the &quot;orchestra&quot;. No formally constructed stone seating existed at this point; only &quot;ikria&quot; and the natural amphitheatre of the hill served as a &quot;theatron&quot;.

Besides the archaeological evidence, there is the literary testimonia of the contemporary plays from which there are clues as to the theatre&#x27;s construction and scenography. For this earliest phase of the theatre there is the work of Aeschylus, who flourished in the 480–460s BC. The dramatic action of the plays does point to the presence of a &quot;skene&quot; or background scenery of some description, the strongest evidence of which is from the &quot;Oresteia&quot; that requires a number of entrances and exits from a palace door. Whether this was a temporary or permanent wooden structure or simply a tent remains unclear since there is no physical evidence for a &quot;skene&quot; building until the Periclean phase. However, the hypothesis of a &quot;skene&quot; is not contradicted by the known archaeology of the site. The &quot;Oresteia&quot; also refers to a roof from which a watchman looks out, a step to the palace and an altar. It is sometimes argued that an &quot;ekkyklema&quot;, a wheeled trolly, was used for the revelation of the bodies by Clytemnestra at line 1372 in &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, amongst other passages. If so it was an innovation of Aeschylus&#x27; stagecraft. However, Oliver Taplin questions the seemingly inconsistent use of the device for the dramatic passages claimed for it, and doubts whether the mechanism existed in Aeschylus&#x27; lifetime.

==Periclean theatre==

The substantial changes to the theatre in the late fifth century BC are conventionally called Periclean since they coincide with the completion of the Odeon of Pericles immediately adjacent and the wider Periclean building programme. However, there is no strong evidence to say the theatre&#x27;s reconstruction was of the same group as the other works or from Pericles’ lifetime. The new plan of the theatre consisted of a slight displacement of the performance area northward, a banking up of the auditorium, the addition of retaining walls to the west, east and north, a long hall south of the &quot;skene&quot; and abutting the Older Temple and a New Temple which was said to have contained a chryselephantine sculpture of Dionysus by Alkamenes. The seating during this phase was probably still in the form of &quot;ikria&quot; but it may be the case that some stone seating had been installed. Inscribed blocks, displaced but preserved in the retaining walls, with fifth-century BC epigraphy on them might indicate dedicated or numbered stone seats. The use of breccia in the foundations of the west wall and the long hall gives a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of the early fifth century BC, and a likely date of the last half of that century when its use was becoming common. Also the last recorded statue of Alkamenes was 404 BC, again placing the works in the late 400s. Pickard-Cambridge argues that the reconstruction was piecemeal over the last half of the century into the period of Kleophon.

From the evidence of the plays there is a larger corpus to draw upon during this most vital period of Greek drama. Sophocles, Aristophanes and Euripides were all performed at the Theatre of Dionysus. From these we can deduce that stock sets may have been in use to meet the requirements of the plays such that the Periclean reconstruction included post-holes built into the terrace wall to provide sockets for movable scenery. The &quot;skene&quot; itself was likely unchanged from the theatre&#x27;s earlier phase, with a wooden structure of at most two floors and a roof. It is also possible that the stage building would have had three doors, with two in the projecting side-wings or &quot;paraskenia&quot;. &quot;Mechane&quot; or &quot;geranos&quot; were used for the introduction of divine beings or flights through the air as in &quot;Medea&quot; or Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Birds&quot;.

One point of contention has been the existence or otherwise of the &quot;prothyron&quot; or columned portico on a &quot;skene&quot; that represents the interior spaces of temples or palaces. It is a supposition partly supported by the texts, but also from vase painting believed to be depictions of plays. Aeschylus &quot;Choēphóroi&quot; 966 and Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Wasps&quot; 800-4 both refer directly to a &quot;prothyron&quot;, while the parodos-chant in Euripides’ &quot;Ion&quot; makes indirect reference to one. The mourning Niobe loutrophoros in Naples and the Boston volute krater, for example, both depict a &quot;prothyron&quot;. Pickard-Cambridge questions if this was permanent structure since interior scenes were rare in tragedy. The evidence from the plays for the use of an &quot;ekkyklema&quot; in this period is ambiguous; passages such as &quot;Acharnians&quot; 407 ff or &quot;Hippolytus&quot; 170-1 suggest but don&#x27;t require the device. The argument for its use depends largely on reference to the &quot;ekkyklema&quot; in later lexographers and scholiasts.

==Lycurgan theatre==

Lycurgus was a leading figure in Athenian politics in the mid- to late-fourth century prior to the Macedonian supremacy, and controller of the state&#x27;s finances. In his role as &quot;epistate&quot; of the Theatre of Dionysus he was also instrumental in transforming the theatre into the stone-built structure seen today. There is a question of how far up the hill the stone &quot;theatron&quot; of this phase went; either all the way up to the rock of the Akropolis (the &quot;kataome&quot;) or only as far as the peripatos. Since the Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos of 320/319 BC required the rock face to be cut back such that it is likely that the &quot;epitheatron&quot; beyond the peripatos would have reached that point by then. 

A coin of the Hadrianic period crudely suggests a division of the theatre into two sections, but only one &quot;diazoma&quot;, or horizontal aisle, and not two if the &quot;epitheatron&quot; went past the peripatos. The auditorium was divided by twelve narrow stairways into thirteen wedge-shaped blocks, &quot;kerkides&quot;, two additional staircases ran inside the two southern supporting walls. There is a slight slope to each step, the front edge is almost 10 cm lower than the back. The seats were 33 cm in depth and 33 cm in height with a forward projecting lip, with seventy-eight rows in total. The two fronts rows, still partially preserved today, consist of Pentelic stone chairs or thrones; these were the &quot;prohedria&quot; or seats of honour. Originally sixty-seven in number, the surviving ones each bear the name of the priest or official who occupied it, the inscriptions are all later than the fourth century, albeit with signs of erasure, and from the Hellenistic or Roman periods. The central throne, which is tentatively dated to the first century BC, belonged to the priest of Dionysus. Towards the orchestra there is a barrier from the Roman era, then a drainage channel contemporary with the Lycurgan theatre.
The &quot;skene&quot; of this phase was built back-to-back with the earlier long hall or stoa, the breccia foundations of which remain. It is evident that the new &quot;skene&quot; building consisted of a long chamber from which projected at either end northward two rectangular &quot;paraskenia&quot;. Whether there was also a distinct &quot;proskenion&quot; in the Lycurgan theatre is a subject of controversy, despite literary testimonia from the period there is no firm agreement where or of what form this took. This era is that of the new comedy of Menander and late tragedy of which it is sometimes supposed that the chorus disappeared from productions. It is further hypothesised that the decline in the use of the orchestra would imply, or permit, a raised stage where all the action would take place.

==Hellenistic theatre==

Amongst the innovations of the Hellenistic period was the creation of a permanent stone &quot;proskenion&quot; and the addition of two flanking &quot;paraskenia&quot; in front. The date of this construction is not secure, it belongs to some point between the third and first centuries BC. The &quot;proskenion&quot; was fronted with fourteen columns. Immediately above was the &quot;logeion&quot;, a roof to the &quot;proskenion&quot;, which perhaps functioned as a high stage. On this second storey and set back from the &quot;logeion&quot; is conjectured to be the &quot;episkenion&quot; whose facade was punctured with several &quot;thyromata&quot; or apertures where the &quot;pinakes&quot; or painted scenery would have been displayed. The date of this change devolves onto the question of the date at which the action of the drama transferred from the &quot;orchestra&quot; to the raised stage, and by analogy with other Greek theatres of the period and the direction of influence between Athens and the other cities. Wilamowitz argues that Dithyrambic contest ended with the choregia in 315, however, Pickard-Cambridge notes that the last recorded victory was in 100 AD. Clearly, the chorus was in decline during this period, so would have been the use of the orchestra. The theatres of Epidaurus, Oropos and Sikyon all have ramps up the &quot;logeion&quot;, their dates range from late fourth century to c. 250 BC. It remains an open question whether the existence of a &quot;logeion&quot; on these theatres implies a change in dramatic form at Athens.

Another feature of the Hellenistic stage that might have been used in Athens was the &quot;periaktoi&quot;, described by Vitruvius and Pollux, these were revolving devices for rapidly changing scenery. Vitruvius places three doors on the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; with a &quot;periaktos&quot; are the extreme ends which could be deployed to indicate that the actor coming stage-left or -right was at a given location in the dramatic context.

==Roman period to present day==

With the conquest of Greece by Sulla and the partial destruction of Athens in 86 BC The Theatre of Dionysus entered into a long decline. King Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia is attributed with the reconstruction of the Odeion and the presence of an honorary inscription to him found embedded in a late wall of the &quot;skene&quot; suggest he may have had a hand in the reconstruction of the theatre, There appears to have been a general refurbishment during the time of Nero whose name was erased from the entablature of an aedicule of the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; in antiquity. The &quot;skene&quot; foundation was underpinned with limestone blocks in this period, the orchestra was reduced in size and refloored in varicoloured marble with a rhombus pattern in the centre. A marble barrier was erected in 61 AD or later, enclosing the &quot;orchestra&quot; up to the &quot;parodoi&quot;. The object of this might have been to protect the audience during gladiatorial combats. The last phase of restoration was in the Hadrianic or Antonine era with the construction of the Bema of Phaidros, an addition to the Neronian high pulpitum stage.

After the late 5th century AD the theatre was abandoned: its orchestra became an enclosed courtyard for a Christian basilica (&quot;aithrion&quot;) which was built into the eastern parados, while its cavea served as a stone quarry. The basilica was subsequently destroyed and by the mid-eleventh century the Rizokastro wall crossed the bema and the parodos walls. Archaeological examination of the site began in earnest in the nineteenth century with the excavation of Rousopoulos in 1861. Subsequent major archaeological campaigns were Dörpfeld-Reisch, Broneer and Travlos.

==Audience==
Evidence points to the enormous popularity of theatre in ancient Greek society. From competition for scarce seating, the expanding number of festivals and performances to theatre lovers touring the Rural Dionysia. It is also clear from fragments of audience reaction that have come down to us that the public were active participants in the dramatic performance, and that there was reciprocal communication between performers and spectators. It is possible, for example, that laws were enacted in the late fifth century to curtail comic outspokenness such was the offence taken by some of the views expressed on the stage. One anecdote that illustrates the fraught nature of this highly partisan audience reaction is that recorded by Plutarch who writes that in 468 BC when Sophocles was competing against Aeschylus there was so much clamour Kimon had to march his generals into the theatre to replace the judges and secure Sophocles’ victory. While ancient drama undoubtedly excited passion in contemporary spectators, there remains the question of to what degree they valued or appreciated the work before them. Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; remarks: “[h]ence there is no need to adhere at all costs to the traditional stories, around which tragedies are constructed. For to try to do this would be ridiculous, since even the well-known materials well-known only to a few, but nevertheless delights all.” This raises the question of how uniform the response to Greek drama was, and whether communicative comprehension and audience competence can be taken for granted.

While the plays of the time are addressed to the adult male citizen class of the city, it is apparent that metics, foreigners and slaves were also in attendance; the cost of tickets was underwritten by the Theoric Fund. Much more controversial is whether women were also present. All arguments on the subject are &quot;ex silentio&quot; since there is no direct evidence that women attended the Theatre of Dionysus. Jeffrey Henderson argues that since women participated in other rites and festivals they could certainly have attended the theatre. In contrast, Simon Goldhill maintains that the City Dionysia was a socio-political event similar to the courts or the assembly from which women were excluded. No definite answer to the problem has been put forward.

==Acoustics==

Due to the poor state of its preservation, the acoustics of the Theatre of Dionysus cannot be reconstructed. However, by analogy with other, similar Greek theatres, some idea of the sound quality of the ancient theatre can be gleaned. Ancient theatres are long renowned for their excellent acoustics, but it is only recently that scientific analysis of this has taken place. The ERATO project in 2003–2006, Gade and Angelakis in 2006, and Psarras et al. in 2013 used omnidirectional source-receivers to make measured maps of strength, reverberation and clarity. Hak et al 2016, used a large number of source-receivers to make an even more detailed mapping. Their findings were that the speech clarity was best in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and that there is a greater degree of reverberation at Epidaurus due to reflection from the opposing seats.

<text>The Weapons Director Badge is a military badge of the United States Air Force which is issued to personnel who are qualified in command and control and have been specially trained as flight controllers in air battle management.

The standard Weapons Director Badge is issued upon completion of basic weapons director or air battle manager command and control training. Upgrades to Senior Weapons Director and Master Weapons Director occur based on experience and years of service in the Air Force. According to AFI 36-2903 (2011), &quot;The Weapons Director basic occupational badge criteria for 1C5X1D is awarded upon completion of the Basic Weapons Director course. For award of the senior badge (7-skill level), Airman must meet requirements for the award of the basic badge and have a minimum of 5 total years qualified Weapons Director experience. For award of the master badge, Airman must meet requirements for award of the senior badge, hold the rank of MSgt or above and have a minimum of 7 total years of Weapons Director experience&quot; (p. 137). The Senior Weapons Director Badge is annotated by a star above the badge and the Master Badge displays a star and wreath.

Most personnel, who receive the Weapons Director Badge, are assigned to Ground Theater Air Control Systems (GTACS) such as the Air Force Control and Reporting Center (CRC). Officers who are not eligible for the Air Battle Manager Badge may be eligible to receive the Weapons Director Badge. 
Advanced training for 1C5X1D Weapons Directors is available at the 8th Weapons Squadron, Nellis AFB, Nevada. This challenging school is available to select 1C5X1D personnel in the rank of Senior Airmen through Technical Sergeant and is one of the most challenging advanced enlisted skills courses in the US Air Force.

The badge was first authorized in mid 1969 for Officers in the 17XX career field, Weapons Control, and was seen as a motivational tool to raise morale in a career field that was noted for its remote assignments, family separations, and difficult living conditions. The regulatory cite is AFR 900-21.

<text>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a form completed by current and prospective college students (undergraduate and graduate) in the United States to determine their eligibility for student financial aid.

The FAFSA is different from CSS Profile (short for &quot;College Scholarship Service Profile&quot;), which is also required by some colleges (primarily private ones). The CSS is a fee-based product of the College Board (a private non-profit organization) and is used by the colleges to distribute their own institutional funds, rather than federal or state funding.

==Eligibility==

In order to receive federal student financial aid, students must meet the following criteria:
* have maintained a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP); 
* be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an eligible non-citizen; 
* have a valid Social Security number; 
* have a high school diploma or GED; 
* have signed the certification statement stating that: 1) they are not in default on a federal student loan and do not owe money on a federal student grant and 2) federal student aid will only be used for educational purposes;
* have not been found guilty of the sale or possession of illegal drugs while federal aid was being received. (This restriction was removed with the 2024 FAFSA.)

Male students between the ages of 18 and 25 were generally required be registered with the Selective Service System (for Conscription in the United States), but the FAFSA Simplification Act removed this requirement starting with the 2021–2022 school year. The FAFSA Simplification Act was a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

Students who are military veterans and active duty service members may apply for financial aid by filing a FAFSA even if they also apply for education and housing benefits offered by the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill and its accompanying Yellow Ribbon program. The amount of military aid a student receives for a college education does not defer eligibility or reduce the amount of student aid that student could receive from the four federal grant programs – Pell, SMART, FSEOG, and TEACH – and many of the state student aid programs.

Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA) of 2010 changed the criteria for suspension of eligibility for drug-related offenses. Previously, students could lose eligibility for either the possession or sale of a controlled substance during the period of enrollment. SAFRA dropped the penalties for possession of a controlled substance but retained the penalties for sale of a controlled substance. SAFRA increases the suspension to two years for a first offense and indefinite for a second offense.

Most students who are eligible to receive federal aid and complete the FAFSA will receive some form of financial aid regardless of their financial need.

==Preparation and filing options==
The FAFSA is made available to the public on October 1 every year for the future academic year. 

Since the 2017–2018 academic year, it becomes available on October 1 every year. The US Department of Education made the FAFSA available earlier to more closely align the timing of the financial aid application process with the typical college application process. The FAFSA Deadline Act in 2024 made the October availability date part of the law. The 2016–2017 academic year was the final time the FAFSA was not made available until January 1.

Two-year old US tax information is used to complete the financial sections of the FAFSA beginning with the 2017–2018 academic year. This change in using &quot;prior-prior tax year&quot; information enables families to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the FAFSA to verify their tax information without a delay from the IRS processing tax information. Some financial aid is provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and students are encouraged to submit a FAFSA as soon as possible.

According to the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s website, students have three options for filling out the form:

* online at (Other websites such as fafsa.com, fafsa.net, may appear to be official but most of these sites charge a fee for assistance) (FAFSA stands for the Free application For Federal Student Aid so no other website should be used other than the official one listed above)
* in the myStudentAid mobile app
*Call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain a PDF of the form

The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 authorized fee-based FAFSA preparation. By law, fee-based FAFSA preparation services must on initial contact with students inform them of the free option and be transparent about their non-affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education and their fees.

==Application process==
Applicants complete the FAFSA by providing their demographic and financial information and, in many cases, the demographic and financial information of their parents/guardians. In addition to this demographic and financial information, applicants can list up to ten schools to receive the results of the application once it is processed. Historically, there was some concern that colleges could deny admission, waitlist applicants, or offer less financial aid as a result of the order in which applicants list schools on the application, or FAFSA position. However, the US Department of Education changed the FAFSA for the 2016–2017 academic year to prevent schools from having access to view other schools that may be listed on the application.

After completing the FAFSA, students are presented with a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR provides a student with their potential eligibility for different types of financial aid, their Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and a summary of the data a student provided in the application. An electronic version of the SAR (called an ISIR) is made available to the colleges/universities the student includes on the FAFSA. The ISIR is also sent to state agencies that award need-based aid.

Students can file an appeal with their college financial aid office in order to seek additional financial aid if their current financial situation is no longer the same as the financial information they provided on FAFSA (i.e. their parent recently lost their job). The exact appeal process can vary from school to school. SwiftStudent, a free service, provides template letters for college students to use when appealing their financial aid.

Currently, students can only list ten schools on their FAFSA application. If students are applying to more than 10 colleges or universities, there are three options they can choose from that allow them to submit their FAFSA application to additional schools.

==Types of federal financial aid==
Federal Student Aid offers several different types of financial aid programs.

* Pell Grant – A grant of up to $6,195 (as of the 2019–2020 Award Year) for students with a low expected family contribution. A 2018 NerdWallet study found that students missed out on $2.6 billion in free federal Pell grants by not completing the FAFSA.
* Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) – A grant between $100 – $4,000 for eligible students and the award is available for Undergraduate students. This grant money is limited at colleges and universities and usually is given to those who have completed their FAFSA application early and are eligible to receive this grant. 
* Federal Direct Subsidized Loan – Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized loans are need-based loans whose interest is paid by the government while the student is enrolled at least half time. Direct Subsidized Loans have fixed interest rates for the life-time of the loan. The interest rates for new loans are set yearly by the U.S. Congress.
* Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan - Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not need-based, meaning that nearly all students are eligible to receive them. Unlike Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans accrue interest the moment they are applied to a student&#x27;s tuition account. Similar to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans have fixed interest rates that are set yearly by the U.S. Congress. 
*The Federal Work-Study Program – An employment program that encourages students with low expected family contributions to find part-time work while pursuing their studies. The program allows the federal government to subsidize a student&#x27;s employer by paying around half of the student&#x27;s wages up to a certain amount. Students do not need to have Federal Work Study to work but some university or non-profit positions may require a student to have Federal Work Study in order to be employed.

== History ==

FAFSA originally came from the 1965 Higher Education Act (HEA) by President Lyndon Johnson, which established that the United States Government would be the primary provider of financial aid for students. For years the application was called Financial Aid Form (FAF), which was an optional form used by some—but not all—colleges and universities. When Congress reauthorized the HEA in 1992 they created a standardized federal form for all prospective students seeking aid. The stated goal of FAFSA and other government funded education programs was to create equal opportunities for students seeking higher education. When the HEA was reauthorized again in 2008 lawmakers added a clause that schools must report information about who is receiving financial aid. Subsequent studies revealed continued inequality for students of color, who often had to take out more student loans than more privileged counterparts. 

Recent updates have been made to increase accessibility of financial aid. The original FAFSA form had 108 questions, which was a significant barrier for many low-income families seeking financial aid. The questions were broadly seen as excessively detailed and unnecessarily complicated, with students being required to dedicate several hours to completing their application. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 shortened the FAFSA from 108 questions to 36, to encourage more eligible students to fill out the form. In addition, students now have the option to link their IRS account with their FAFSA account to make the application simpler to complete accurately. Students must now report the value of their family business or farm. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also opened financial aid eligibility to students that had previously been excluded from the program.
More than 14 Million applications were submitted in 2006. 

=== 2024 changes ===

In 2024, the Department of Education made substantial changes to FAFSA in response to the FAFSA Simplification Act in 2020. Some of these changes were initially plagued with technical errors and glitches, causing significant delays in the release of data to colleges and universities and considerable confusion and frustration among parents and students. Students from disadvantaged groups and low-income backgrounds are among the vulnerable student demographics who were disproportionately impacted by the technical obstacles. These students might not have access to the tools or assistance they need to deal with the challenges of submitting a financial aid application.

The problems with the FAFSA resulted in a congressional hearing where witnesses reported that the multiple errors and delays in releasing data to colleges and universities could significantly diminish enrollment. Richard Cordray, the Department of Education employee in charge of Federal Student Aid, subsequently announced his resignation at the end of June.

In order to fill out the FAFSA, parents and students must create an FSA ID. Inconsistent personal information caused problems for some individuals surrounding ID verification, including errors in names, addresses, and other information, which has led to delays in the processing of applications for financial assistance.

Students from disadvantaged groups and low-income backgrounds are thought to be disproportionately impacted by the technical obstacles. Many are urging changes to the FAFSA application process in order to resolve these technical issues and guarantee fair access to financial assistance. They contend that students are unfairly burdened by the current system, especially those who already face obstacles to pursuing higher education. 

=== 2025 ===
In February 2025, the Department of Education announced that the FAFSA form would be altered to no longer allow students to identify as nonbinary. The change is being made to comply with the executive order issued by Donald Trump that defines gender as a strict male-female binary.

<doc id="974657" wikidata="Q1114558" url="?curid=974657" title="Sea monk">
<text>The sea monk (also monk-fish or monkfish) was a sea creature found off the eastern coast of the Danish island of Zealand in 1546. It was described as a &quot;fish&quot; that outwardly resembled a human monk in his habit.

== Names ==
The creature was called &quot;monk fish&quot; () by Belon (1553), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;fish [wearing] the habit of a monk&quot;) by Rondelet (1554).

The name &quot;sea monk&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was applied to it by Gesner (1558), and Joannes Sluperius (1572; ; ) as well.

==History==
The alleged sea monk was captured at sea between Denmark&#x27;s Zealand and Sweden, in the strait Øresund, probably in 1546. Christian III of Denmark sent an illustration of it to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The creature is recorded in Vedel&#x27;s &quot;Den danske Krønicke&quot; (1575) as measuring 4 ells long (). It was either caught in a herring net, or stranded, depending on the source.

=== 16th-century natural history ===
The capture of the sea monk is dated to either 1546 or 1549 in 16th-century literature, or to both dates, in the case of Lycosthenes
(1557), who states both captures occurred near Copenhagen, Denmark. There is also a German woodcut by Stefan Hamer possibly dating to 1546, illustrating the sea-monk caught in Copenhagen in 1546.

The sea monk was listed in several illustrated natural history books published in the mid-16th century, such as Pierre Belon (1553), Guillaume Rondelet (1554), and Conrad Gesner (1558). It was described as a &quot;fish&quot; that looked superficially like a monk.

Belon (1553) gave a briefer notice on &quot;piscis monachus&quot; (monk-fish) in his Latin volume, a more expanded account appearing later in his French version of 1555.

Rondelet (1554) called it &quot;the fish with the habit of a monk (&quot;piscis monachi habitu&quot;), and classed it as a merman (&quot;homo maris&quot;). But he did not think the pictorial representations he obtained could be taken at face value, and suspected they were embellished &quot;by the painter to make the thing seem more marvelous&quot;. What prompted his suspicions of artistic license seems to be his discovery of other portrayals of the monkfish, quite different from his own, obtained by his rival and friend Gesner and others in Rome.

Rondelet stated that a drawing of it from life (or corpse) was made by an artist in the presence of a certain gentleman, who gave a copy to Charles V, and another copy to Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, the latter of which was provided to Rondelet. The picture being the gift of Marguerite, a great patron of the sciences, meant it was not something to be readily dismissed, but rather authenticated, by Marguerite, treated as an authority on par with Pliny.

Rondelet&#x27;s information was imperfect in other ways: he stated the creature had been taken in &quot;Norway [sic.] at Diezum near the town called Denelopoch&quot;, but this was a garbling of &quot;Die Sund&quot; (&quot;the Sound&quot; of Øresund) off of Ellenbogen (Malmö, Sweden). The information was conveyed through some intermediary German source.

Belon (1555) in his French edition about the monk-fish also classed the monk-fish as a merman (), and garnished his commentary with mention of merfolk from ancient writings, specifically sirens, tritons, naiads, and nereids. Belon, according to Steenstrup&#x27;s assessment, had faith in the existence of this sea monk without ever having seen one. Belon attributed these curiosities to &quot;playfulness of Nature&quot;.

The fourth volume of Conrad Gesner&#x27;s famous &quot;Historia Animalium&quot; described it, and although much of Gesner&#x27;s piece was derivative or even copied wholesale from his predecessors, Belon and Rondelet, he appended a &quot;collolarium&quot; section containing his own findings and observations. As to the creature that measured 4 cubits, Gesner added that it had a black face like an Ethiopian, according to a German rhyme. Gesner here quoted Albertus Magnus&#x27;s account of the &quot;monachus maris&quot;. He also mentioned a similar monster found in the Firth of Forth, citing Scottish historian Hector Boethius (Hector Boece). Gesner had two other sources to draw from, namely Georg Fabricius and Hector Mythobius.

The aforementioned Lycosthenes in &quot;Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon&quot; [Of Portents and Shown Times] (1557) described the 1546 sea monk as having a black head, and gave an illustration of it as such.

=== Literary works ===
The sea monk was subsequently popularised in Guillaume du Bartas&#x27;s epic poem &quot;La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde&quot;, where the poet speaks of correspondences between land and sea, mentioning both the &quot;mytred Bishop&quot; and the &quot;cowled Fryer&quot;:
&quot;Seas have (as well as skies) Sun, Moon, and Stars;
(As well as ayre) Swallows, and Rooks, and Stares;
(As well as earth) Vines, Roses, Nettles, Millions,
Pinks, Gilliflowers, Mushrooms, and many millions
of other Plants lants (more rare and strange than these)
As very fishes living in the Seas.
And also Rams, Calfs, Horses, Hares, and Hogs,
Wolves, Lions, Urchins, Elephants and Dogs,
Yea, Men and Mayds; and (which I more admire)
The mytred Bishop and the cowled Fryer;
Whereof, examples, (but a few years since)
Were shew&#x27;n the Norways, and Polonian Prince.&quot;
==Explanations==

In the early 1850s, Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup suggested that the sea-monk was a giant squid, a theory more recently popularised by writer Richard Ellis. Cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans believed the report was based on the discovery of an errant walrus.

More recently, it has been suggested that it was an angelshark, &quot;Squatina squatina&quot;, which is commonly called &quot;monkfish&quot; in English or &quot;munk&quot; in Norwegian and Danish. Other suspected identities of the sea monk include the grey seal, the hooded seal, the monk seal, or a hoax such as a Jenny Haniver.

<doc id="974660" wikidata="Q251123" url="?curid=974660" title="Álvaro Mutis">
<text>Álvaro Mutis Jaramillo (August 25, 1923 – September 22, 2013) was a Colombian poet, novelist, and essayist. His best-known work is the novel sequence &quot;The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll&quot;, which revolves around the character of Maqroll el Gaviero. He won the 1991 International Nonino Prize in Italy. He was awarded the 2001 Miguel de Cervantes Prize and the 2002 Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

==Early life==
Mutis was born in Bogotá and lived in Brussels from the age of two until eleven, where his father, Santiago Mutis Dávila, held a post as a diplomat. They would return to Colombia by ship for summer holidays. During this time Mutis&#x27; family stayed at his grandfather&#x27;s coffee and sugar cane plantation, Coello. For Álvaro Mutis, the impressions of these early years, his reading of Jules Verne and of Pablo Neruda&#x27;s &quot;Residencia en la tierra&quot;, and, especially, contact with &quot;el trópico&quot; (the tropics), are the mainspring of his work. Mutis studied high school at the Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario in Bogotá under the tutelage of the Colombian poet Eduardo Carranza. Although he never finished school, he entered the literary world in Bogotá as a poet, a member of the Cántico group that emerged in 1940s. In 1948 Mutis and Carlos Patiño published a chapbook of poems called &quot;La balanza.&quot; From 1956 on, he lived in Mexico City, gaining renown there as the result of the positive reviews of his work by Octavio Paz, who was a champion of Mutis&#x27; early poetry.

The first important recognition of Álvaro Mutis&#x27;s work was in 1974: the National Prize for Letters of Colombia.

==Literary career==
Mutis&#x27; poetry was first published in 1948 and his first short stories in 1978. His first novella featuring Maqroll, &quot;La nieve del Almirante&quot; (&quot;The Snow of the Admiral&quot;) was published in 1986 and gained him popular and critical acclaim. He has received many literary awards, including the Prix Médicis (France, 1989), Premio Príncipe de Asturias de las Letras (Spain, 1997), Premio Miguel de Cervantes (Spain, 2001), and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature (United States, 2002), for &quot;The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll&quot;, a volume collecting all seven novellas about Maqroll the Gaviero.

Mutis has combined his career as a writer of poetry and prose with a diverse set of non-literary occupations. Like his protagonist Maqroll, Mutis traveled widely in his professional roles including five years as Standard Oil&#x27;s public relations director and over 20 years as sales manager for Twentieth Century Fox and Columbia Pictures in their Latin American television divisions. Latin Americans first became familiar with his voice when he did the narration for the Spanish-language television version of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

In the 1950s, Mutis spent 15 months in a Mexican prison Palacio de Lecumberri as a consequence of his handling of money that had been set aside for charitable use by Standard Oil. He had been using the money to help his friends who were under threat from the military dictatorship in Colombia, and after he fled to Mexico, the Mexican government bowed to Colombian pressure and had him imprisoned. As soon as the Colombian dictatorship fell, the charges against him were dropped and he was freed. His experience in prison had a lasting influence on his life and work, and is chronicled in the book &quot;Diario de Lecumberri&quot;.
==Critical reception==
Mutis&#x27; close friend, Nobel Prize-winner Gabriel García Márquez, called him &quot;one of the greatest writers of our time.&quot;

Mutis&#x27; works are most widely read in Latin America and Europe. Mutis is not well known in the anglophone world, probably because he is not easy to categorize. His literary work is not part of what is commonly understood in the American academy as &quot;Latin American Literature&quot;. Maqroll, his most well-known character, is of indeterminate origin, nationality, age and physiognomy. He is not evidently from Latin America and does not represent anything particularly Latin American in character. Maqroll is a solitary traveler who brings a stranger&#x27;s detachment to his encounters and his lovers; he searches for meaning in a time of violence and inhumanity. In this sense some literary critics have compared Maqroll to Sophocles&#x27; Oedipus.

== Political views ==
Mutis described himself as &quot;reactionary, legitimist and monarchist&quot;. Labelled as an &quot;old reactionary&quot;, he was the coauthor of the 2002 &quot;Manifesto Against the Death of the Spirit and the Earth&quot;, itself described as an initiative to promote the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite.

<text>V2 Records (or V2 Music and V2 Benelux; V2 being an abbreviation for Virgin 2) is a record label that was purchased by Universal Music Group in 2007, sold to PIAS in 2013 and partially acquired by Universal in 2022 (as part of larger PIAS 49% equity acquisition). In 2024, Universal acquired the remaining 51% of PIAS that it did not already own. In Benelux, V2 would operate separately from PIAS from 2013 to 2022, since the label was bought from Universal in 2007, henceforth Universal Music Group fully owns V2.

==History==
The label was founded in 1996 by Richard Branson, five years after he sold Virgin Records to EMI. V2 management was led by the same individuals that built Branson&#x27;s balloon and the control position was held by a Canadian public corporation. The company was restructured after running into financial difficulties with Branson taking control and reinventing the brand.

The label was owned 95% by Morgan Stanley, the chief financier of the company, and 5% by Branson. Over the years V2 acquired Gee Street Records, Junior Boy&#x27;s Own, Blue Dog Records, and Big Cat Records. The label also distributed many labels, such as Wichita, Fania, Luaka Bop, City Slang and Modular. Stereophonics were the first band to sign to the label.

V2 now operates in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States. It was distributed in the US by BMG; however it left for WEA shortly after the formation of Sony BMG. Its headquarters were located at 14 East 4th Street in Manhattan, the former US home of Island Records, which was in the same building as the former Greenwich Village branch of Tower Records.

In April 2005, Cooperative Music was set up by the V2 Music Group as a transnational marketing and distribution operation which licenses independent labels, as opposed to individual artist companies which is the standard industry practice, for release in Europe, Australia and Japan. This in-house licensing division has an exclusive international marketing team with representation in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Australia and Japan.

In May 2006, much of V2&#x27;s catalogue, including multi-platinum artists Moby and The White Stripes, was added to eMusic, making the label one of the most high-profile featured on the online music site, which mostly sells DRM-free independent music at a cost considerably lower than many of its competitors.

In August 2007, V2 Music Group was sold for £7 million to Universal Music Group. Subsequently, in October 2007, UMG partnered the US operations of its independent distribution arm Fontana Distribution, known as Fontana International, with London-based Cooperative Music of V2 Music. The intent was to enhance expansion through international agreements, and so independent labels from Europe under Cooperative Music would gain access to the independent American marketplace through Fontana International&#x27;s diverse connections in independent marketing, promotion and distribution support. Cooperative Music has had significant success with various acts such as Fleet Foxes, Phoenix and The Black Keys.

In 2013, [PIAS] has acquired Cooperative Music (including V2) from Universal Music Group.

In November 2022, Universal Music Group purchased a 49% stake in [PIAS] (including V2).

=== V2 Benelux ===
V2 Benelux was founded by Richard Branson in 1997 as part of the V2 International group with affiliates in USA, UK, Scandinavia, Germany, France, Italy and Benelux. In February 2007 the directors of V2 Benelux, Chris Boog and Tom Willinck, rounded off a successful management buy out together with their distributor, Bertus Distribution part of the Artone Group. The Artone Group consists of V2 Records Benelux, Bertus Distribution, Townsend Music and Record Industry. V2 Records Benelux has offices in Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium.

=== V2 North America ===
In 2006 Branson sold V2 North America to Sheridan Square Entertainment LLC (SSE) for $15 million. SSE then merged its label Artemis Records into V2 North America. The new label was effectively divested from the Virgin Group. Sheridan Square was later acquired by IndieBlu, which itself was acquired by Entertainment One.

On 12 January 2007, V2 North America announced that it was undergoing restructuring to focus on its back catalogue and digital distribution. As a result, their employees were let go and their roster of artists left as free agents.

<doc id="974664" wikidata="Q1134090" url="?curid=974664" title="Digital on-screen graphic">
<text>A digital on-screen graphic, digitally originated graphic (DOG, bug, network bug, or screenbug) is a watermark-like station logo that most television broadcasters overlay over a portion of the screen area of their programs to identify the channel. They are thus a form of permanent visual station identification, increasing brand recognition and asserting ownership of the video signal.

The graphic identifies the source of programming, even if it has been time-shifted—that is, recorded to videotape, DVD, or a digital personal video recorder such as TiVo. Many of these technologies allow viewers to skip or omit traditional between-programming station identification; thus the use of a DOG enables the station or network to enforce brand identification even when standard commercials are skipped.

DOG watermarking helps to reduce off-the-air copyright infringement—for example, the distribution of a current series&#x27; episodes on DVD: the watermarked content is easily differentiated from &quot;official&quot; DVD releases, and can help identify not only the station from which the broadcast was captured, but usually the actual date of the broadcast as well.

Graphics may be used to identify if the correct subscription is being used for a type of venue. For example, showing Sky Sports within a pub in the United Kingdom requires a more expensive subscription; a channel authorized under this subscription adds a pint glass graphic to the bottom of the screen for inspectors to see. The graphic changes at certain times, making it harder to counterfeit.

On the other hand, watermarks pollute the picture, distract viewers&#x27; attention and may cover an important piece of information presented in the television program. Extremely bright watermarks may cause screen burn-in or Image persistence on some types of TV sets such as the now mostly discontinued and rarely used plasma and CRT displays, and currently commonly used OLED and LCD displays.

Usage of visually perceptible embedded watermarks requires the program author to have a separate clean copy for archival purposes, but this practice was not common decades ago when watermarking became popular among broadcasters. Watermarks present an issue when archival videos are used for a documentary that strives to create a coherent story. In some cases, watermarks are blurred or digitally removed if possible to clean up the picture. In the absence of visually perceptible watermarks content control can be ensured with visually imperceptible digital watermarks.

In some cases, the graphic also shows the name of the current program. Some television networks may place additional logos or text alongside their DOG to advertise significant upcoming programs. For example, broadcasters of the Olympic Games (most notably United States broadcaster NBC) often add the Olympic rings to their DOG for a period of time leading up to—and during—the Games.

==Usage==
==Connections with sponsor tags==
Another graphic on television usually connected with sports (particularly in North America, though not in Europe) is the sponsor tag. It shows the logos of certain sponsors, accompanied by some background relevant to the game, the network logo, announcement and music of some kind.

==Usage in ham radio and TV==
In most countries, the ham station is required to periodically identify their amateur-TV transmission. Such stations frequently overlay their callsign on the signal instead of placing a card in the background. Most hams use homebuilt devices or old consumer character generators to generate such identifications rather than using graphical superimposes of high cost to do so. Only rarely one can see real graphics, as the callsign is usually written in the &quot;OSD font&quot;.

==Live DOGs by hobbyists==
One of the easiest and most sought-after devices used to generate DOGs by hobbyists is the 1980s vintage Sony XV-T500 video superimposer. This device can luma-key a signal, capture a still frame into memory and then overlay the keyed graphic in one of eight colors onto any CVBS signal. Another method commonly used by hobbyists and even low-budgeted TV stations in former times was Amiga computers with genlock interfaces.

<text>Spina was an Etruscan port city, established by the end of the 6th century BCE, on the Adriatic at the ancient mouth of the Po.

==Discovery==
The site of Spina was lost until modern times, when drainage schemes in the delta of the Po River in 1922 first officially revealed a necropolis of Etruscan Spina about four miles west of the commune of Comacchio.

The fishermen of Comacchio, it soon turned out, had been the source of &quot;Etruscan&quot; vases (actually ancient imports from Greece) and other artifacts that had appeared for years on the archeological black market.

The archaeological finds from the burials of Spina were discovered with the help of aerial photography. Aside from the white reflective surfaces of the modern drainage channels there appeared in the photographs a ghostly network of dark lines and light rectangles, the former indicating richer vegetation on the sites of ancient canals. Thus the layout of the ancient trading port was revealed, now miles from the sea, due to the sedimentation of the Po delta.

== Trading centre ==
Spina was founded around 525 BC, soon after Adria. Despite the Greek foundation story mentioned by Pliny the Elder, it had a predominantly Etruscan population, but also a significant Greek presence.

The population of Spina became significantly Hellenised. 

The city built a treasury in Delphi.

Many of the goods imported through Spina were destined for the bigger Etruscan city of Felsina (ancient name of Bologna).

The city was at the southern end of the ancient Amber Road from the Baltic Sea. This trade was done through the Veneti, whose cities were to the north. They also traded in horses, for which the Veneti were famous.

== Hydraulic engineering ==
Etruscan hydraulic engineers managed to confine the wide Po river at Spina to its bed, by the means of constructing many canals to direct its flow. As a result the disastrous spring floods were mitigated. Much other evidence of Etruscan hydraulic engineering works remains in the area. They have drained the marshes and provided irrigation for dry lands.

<doc id="974674" wikidata="Q1050848" url="?curid=974674" title="Satyr play">
<text>The satyr play is a form of Attic theatre performance related to both comedy and tragedy. It preserves theatrical elements of dialogue, actors speaking verse, a chorus that dances and sings, masks and costumes. Its relationship to tragedy is strong; satyr plays were written by tragedians, and satyr plays were performed in the Dionysian festival following the performance of a group of three tragedies. The satyr play&#x27;s mythological-heroic stories and the style of language are similar to that of the tragedies. Its connection with comedy is also significant – it has similar plots, titles, themes, characters, and happy endings. The remarkable feature of the satyr play is the chorus of satyrs, with their costumes that focus on the phallus, and with their language, which uses wordplay, sexual innuendos, references to breasts, farting, erections, and other references that do not occur in tragedy. As Mark Griffith points out, the satyr play was &quot;not merely a deeply traditional Dionysiac ritual, but also generally accepted as the most appropriate and satisfying conclusion to the city’s most complex and prestigious cultural event of the year.&quot;

The satyric drama may be traced back to Pratinas of Phlius, . After settling in Athens, he probably adapted the dithyramb, customary in his native home, with its chorus of satyrs, to complement the form of tragedy which had been recently invented in Athens. It met with approval and was further developed by his son Aristias, by Choerilus, by Aeschylus, and others.

==Origins==

The origins of performance culture and the emergence of the satyr play can be traced to ancient rural celebrations in honour of the god Dionysus. Rush Rehm argues that these inaugurated the &quot;agricultural cycle of planting and harvesting&quot; closely associated with Dionysus, who represented the embodiment of &quot;a fundamental paradox inherent to the world, life-giving but potentially destructive.&quot; The role of the satyr play within the Festival of Dionysus is often noted to be not as important as the tragedies presented at the festival; however, it is crucial not to downplay its importance in the history of the dramatic arts. The dramatic festivities at the City Dionysia in Athens, similarly dedicated to Dionysus, required each competing tragedian to submit three tragedies and a satyr play, which functioned as the last piece performed at the festival. The accurate emergence of the satyr play is debatable; however, Brockett argues that most evidence “credits Pratinas with having invented this form sometime before 501 BC”, which is supported by P. E. Easterling’s argument that by the 5th century the satyr play was considered an integral component of the &quot;tragike didaskalia&quot;. Brockett also suggests the possibility that the satyr play was the first form of drama from which both tragedy and comedy gradually emerged.

A. E. Haigh however maintained that the satyr play is a survival from “the primitive period of Bacchic worship”. Haigh lists several examples of recorded entries to the City Dionysia: thus, in 472 BC Aeschylus won the first prize with &quot;Phineaus&quot;, &quot;Persae&quot;, &quot;Glaucus&quot; and the satyr play &quot;Prometheus&quot;. Among Euripides’ entries, Haigh underlines &quot;Theristae&quot; (431 BC), &quot;Sisyphus&quot; (415 BC) and &quot;Alcestis&quot; which Euripides was allowed to present as a replacement of the traditional satyr play. Much of the evidence and information found regarding satyr plays and their history has been located through vase paintings.

The mythological origins of the satyrs are closely linked to the advent of Dionysus into Hellenic culture. The satyrs and their female counterpart, the maenads, were followers of Dionysus, a “late-comer to Olympus and probably of Asiatic origin”. According to Roger Lancelyn Green, the satyrs probably began as minor nature deities, while their designated leader Silenus originated as a water spirit, a maker of springs and fountains. Silenus was already an attendant to Dionysus when the satyrs joined the god’s following, and was subsequently proclaimed their father. The satyrs characterised themselves by amorality, excessive drinking and the breaking down of traditional values and barriers. Eric Csapo and Margaret C. Miller further argue that satyrs have a strong connection with music and dance and consider them to be “archetypal musicians and dancers”, thus linking them to Dionysiac processions and the origins of performance culture.

The Great Dionysia went through a phase of change around the middle of the fourth century. This change brought with it a switch in the ways plays were performed. Plays were no longer performed in a completion/competition type setting. Satyrs were now performed outside of the Festival of Dionysus and were no longer subjected to the judgement among other plays. Satyrs and comedies became more relevant within the theatre community in the 430s. The newfound prevalence came after Morychides began to forbid fighting-related activities on the stage. Satyr plays did have some influence on other forms of performance as well; of the most noteworthy is Middle Comedy. This time period for comedy brought with it the humbling of gods and heroes; which was done through the domesticizing of these characters within the different performances. Middle Comedy took on many of the factors of satyr plays but adapted the performances to be what was desired by the public at that time. These plays have been said to be performed well into the Hellenistic and Roman eras.

==Extant examples==

The only satyr play to survive in its entirety is Euripides&#x27; &quot;Cyclops&quot;, based on Odysseus&#x27; encounter with the cyclops Polyphemus, in Book 9 of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Aeschylus was noted for his satyr plays, the largest fragment of which to have survived being his &quot;Dictyulci&quot; (&#x27;The Net Fishers&#x27;) in which the baby Perseus is washed up on the shore with his mother Danae and is found by Silenus and the satyrs. There are large fragments of a satyr play of Sophocles called &quot;Ichneutae&quot; (&#x27;The Trackers&#x27;) in which the satyrs are employed by Apollo to track down his stolen cattle and discover the baby Hermes. Smaller fragments of other satyr plays exist, and the genre continued to be written and performed as late as the 2nd century AD, though most have wholly vanished. Even a fragment of music survives from a satyr play.

==Costumes==

The chorus members wore masks in accordance with Bacchic tradition. The earliest reliable testimony is supplied by the Pandora Vase dating from the middle of the 5th century BC. On that vase, the satyrs are portrayed as half men and half goats, wearing goat’s horns on their heads, thus referring to the goat deities of the Doric type.

A later representation can be seen on the Pronomos Vase, found in Naples. The goatish element has disappeared and the satyrs resemble the old Ionic Sileni who were horse deities. The performers are wearing horse tails and short pants with attached phallus, a symbol of Dionysiac worship. Haigh claims that the Doric satyrs were the original performers in Attic tragedy and satiric drama, whereas the Ionic element was introduced at a later stage.

<text>La Résistance was a professional wrestling tag team and former stable who performed for World Wrestling Entertainment. The name of the team is a reference to the French Resistance.

==History==

===World Wrestling Entertainment===

====Debut====
The stable was created when WWE aired vignettes of two arrogant &quot;Frenchmen&quot; (Sylvain Grenier and René Duprée, who are both actually French-Canadians) attacking the United States and its policy from a French news studio.
Grenier and Duprée made their first appearance on the April 28, 2003, edition of &quot;Raw&quot; as La Résistance by attacking then-babyface, Scott Steiner. Steiner had made remarks two weeks earlier comparing France to hell and Grenier and Duprée were offended. La Résistance went on to feud with Scott Steiner and Test who was forced to be Steiner&#x27;s tag team partner by Stacy Keibler, La Résistance ended up defeating Steiner and Test at Judgment Day on May 18, 2003, in the team&#x27;s pay-per-view debut. Their most notorious insult to the United States came on Memorial Day in 2003 when they interrupted &quot;Raw&quot; announcer Lilian Garcia as she was singing America the Beautiful. After several minutes of Grenier calling America barbarians and saying that France would not allow the US to be the police force of the world, the sound of glass shattering suddenly filled the arena when Steve Austin cleared the ring of La Résistance and said some unflattering remarks about the French nation.

On the May 26, 2003, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Grenier defeated Rob Van Dam in a Flag match to win a World Tag Team Championship shot. Grenier and Duprée went on to win the World Tag Team Championship from Kane and Rob Van Dam at Bad Blood.

====Addition of Robert Conway====
In mid 2003 the decision was made to add a third member, Rob Conway, who posed as an American serviceman being abused by Grenier and Duprée. When The Dudley Boyz came out to attack La Résistance they brought Conway in the ring with an American flag. Once the Dudley Boyz had their backs turned to Conway, he attacked them with the American flag and then tore it off the pole and laid it on top of them.

La Resistance lost the titles at Unforgiven 2003 in a three on two handicapped tables match to the Dudley Boyz. The trio went on to feud with several other tag teams, including Hurricane and Rosey, and the team of Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak before Grenier suffered a back injury in October 2003. Duprée and Conway would hold the team together until Grenier&#x27;s return on the March 15, 2004, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, but the stable was broken up the very next week when Duprée was drafted in a lottery by WWE&#x27;s other brand, SmackDown.

At WrestleMania XX, La Résistance competed in a Fatal 4-Way match for the World Tag Team Championship where Booker T and Rob Van Dam retained the titles.

====Conway and Grenier====
While Duprée went to &quot;SmackDown&quot; and established his French Phenom persona, Conway and Grenier were left to keep La Résistance together as a unit. (neither Duprée nor the La Résistance tag team changed their entrance music.) Conway began being billed as Robért Conway (pronounce Robe-air), and he and Grenier began being announced as hailing from Quebec City (later changed to simply the Province of Quebec) instead of France and wore new ring attire with the blue and white colours of Quebec along with the traditional fleur-de-lis. Several months after the loss of Duprée, La Résistance went on to defeat Edge and Chris Benoit for the World Tag Team Titles in Grenier&#x27;s home town of Montreal, Quebec, to a standing ovation.

With the help of Raw General manager Eric Bischoff, La Résistance managed to keep hold of the titles for five months, but at the first interactive PPV Taboo Tuesday they had to defend their titles against the two Superstars who were not voted for by the fans to get a World Heavyweight Championship shot at Triple H. This stipulation meant they would either face the team of Edge and Benoit, Edge and Shawn Michaels, or Benoit and Michaels.

During Taboo Tuesday, the announcement was made that Shawn Michaels had been voted for a title shot with 38.72% of the vote compared to Edge&#x27;s 33.42% and Benoit&#x27;s 27.86%; this meant La Résistance would meet Edge and Benoit in a rematch of their championship victory five months earlier. They would lose the titles to Edge and Benoit, even though Edge left the arena half-way through the match leaving Benoit to win the match on his own. As Grenier and Conway invoked their rematch clause thirteen days later on Raw, the dissension between Benoit and Edge would continue and finally be their undoing as La Résistance won the titles back. Soon after, on the November 15, 2004, edition of Raw, La Résistance lost the World Tag Team Championship again, this time to Eugene and William Regal.

Grenier and Conway managed to win the World Tag Team Championship for the third time together and fourth since the creation of the stable. This championship win was a rare one since it was won at a Raw-brand house show on January 16, 2005, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. This time, La Résistance defeated Regal and Jonathan Coachman, who was taking the place of the legitimately injured Eugene (who would miss several months due to a left patella tear at &quot;New Year&#x27;s Revolution)&quot;. Grenier and Conway soon lost the belts back to Regal and his tag team partner Tajiri, on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; taking place from Tajiri&#x27;s hometown of Tokyo.

La Résistance repeatedly attempted to regain the gold (mainly on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;) from Regal and Tajiri in many different matches but just fell short during each one. During their &quot;last shot&quot; for the gold the team thought they had won back the titles only to have the decision reversed by referee Mike Chioda due to La Résistance&#x27;s Grenier pinning Tajiri, not Regal, who was the legal man. La Résistance went on to lose the match.

On the March 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, La Résistance were defeated by The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) in a Rockers&#x27;s Reunion. At WrestleMania 21, La Résistance competed in a 30-man Battle Royal which was won by Booker T.

While this was to be their last chance to win back the gold from Regal and Tajiri, the team were given one more chance during a Tag Team Turmoil match during Backlash. In the match, La Résistance managed to eliminate the champions but were still unable to win the match and regain the titles as they were defeated by the winners of the match, Rosey and The Hurricane. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, La Résistance tried again to win the titles in a match against the new champions but were unsuccessful again. They would feud with Hurricane and Rosey, having various filler matches on multiple pay-per-view events.

====Disbanding====
Grenier and Conway went into singles competition with announcers claiming that the members of La Résistance were trying to &quot;one up&quot; each other in singles matches without the other man in their corner. This saw Conway defeat a jobber and Val Venis, while Grenier was defeated by both Val Venis and Chris Jericho before both men competed in a triple threat match (against Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin for the title), Benjamin won the match, not long after the La Résistance members began to argue and fight. This altercation between the two led to a taped main event match on June 6, 2005, for the June 12 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. This match saw Rob Conway portray the heel character, and defeat Sylvain Grenier.

On June 30, 2005, Grenier and Dupree were last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft, which saw Grenier leave &quot;Raw&quot; to go to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and Dupree come back to &quot;Raw&quot;.

====Reformations====
On April 3, 2006, Rene Duprée and Rob Conway teamed together in a dark match before &quot;Raw&quot;, in a losing effort against The Highlanders

While in WWE Developmental Territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling, Conway and Grenier briefly reteamed as La Résistance in a match on November 15, 2006, to earn an OVW Southern Tag Team Championship match by defeating the reigning champions, Cody Runnels and Shawn Spears. However the team would not win the title match.

On February 20, 2007, as La Résistance Dupree and Grenier made their return as a tag team on the ECW brand defeating Los Luchas, but on March 1, 2007, Dupree was suspended due to a violation of the Health and Wellness policy. This left Grenier and Conway to team together again in OVW and dark matches for the next couple months until May 11, 2007, when Conway was released from WWE.

On July 26, 2007, Duprée was also released from his WWE contract. On August 13, 2007, Grenier was released from his WWE contract officially ending the WWE careers of all three La Résistance members.

===Independent circuit (2008–2009, 2016–2017)===
On August 30, 2008, Grenier and Conway, as La Résistance, defeated Jay Phenomenon and Karl Briscoe to win the NCW Tag Team Championships.

On March 21, 2009, Grenier and Conway as La Résistance defeated Les Titans (Bishop and Chakal) to become the new TOW Tag Team Champions. On September 25, 2009, they lost the titles when they were defeated by Al Snow and Pierre Carl Ouellet.

<doc id="974683" wikidata="Q156523" url="?curid=974683" title="Sodom (band)">
<text>Sodom is a German thrash metal band from Gelsenkirchen, formed in 1981. They have gone through many lineup changes, with bassist/vocalist Tom Angelripper the only constant member. The band is currently composed of Angelripper, guitarists Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik (who was a member of Sodom from 1987 to 1989 and rejoined in 2018) and Yorck Segatz, and drummer Toni Merkel. Sodom has been referred to as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal, along with Kreator, Destruction and Tankard. Sodom heavily influenced the German black metal scene, and is regarded as a pioneer of death metal. Mike McPadden wrote that the most Venom-blackened of German &quot;Three Kings&quot; (Destruction and Kreator being the other two), Sodom further merged thrash and death metal into a &quot;wicked and decadent sound.&quot;

Sodom has released seventeen studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums and seven EPs. They achieved their first commercial success with their third studio album, &quot;Agent Orange&quot; (1989), which was one of the first thrash metal albums to enter the German album charts, where it reached number 36. Their most recent studio album, &quot;Genesis XIX&quot;, was released on 27 November 2020. Sodom is one of the best-selling thrash metal acts of all time, having sold over two million records.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1981–1986)===

Sodom&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Tom &quot;Angelripper&quot; Such, Bloody Monster, Arius &quot;Blasphemer&quot;, and Aggressor. Reportedly named in reference to the Venom song &quot;One Thousand Days in Sodom&quot;, the band was initiated by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in coal mines in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. The band became a cohesive unit when Chris Witchhunter (Christian Dudek) from Essen replaced Bloody Monster on drums, bringing songwriting experience from his time in school, and spearheading the creativity process after Arius had been fired. Taking inspiration from bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motörhead, Venom, Kiss, Tank, Accept, Raven, Rainbow, AC/DC and UFO, the group continued as a three-piece in the Motörhead-fashion and released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer. Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the &quot;In the Sign of Evil&quot; EP (which is generally regarded as an important early black metal release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who himself did not last long, and left following the recording of &quot;In the Sign of Evil&quot;. Michael &quot;Destructor&quot; Wulf was found as a replacement, after which the band went and recorded &quot;Obsessed by Cruelty&quot; (1986), their full-length debut featuring music that was mostly in the vein of &quot;In the Sign of Evil.&quot; Wulf did not last in the band long, and later joined Kreator (where he also only had a brief stint; he died after a tragic motorcycle accident in 1993).

===Change to thrash metal and increasing popularity (1987–1990)===
For the most part, Sodom was at first not taken seriously, with various press sources describing them as &quot;a second-rate Venom clone with semi-inventive lyrics&quot;. One member would change that. Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik came in to fill the guitar spot Wulf had left behind. Frank convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom to embrace political, societal, and war themes. Tom was already interested in various wars yet remained a peacenik. New inspiration culminated into Gosdzik&#x27;s full-length debut with the band, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Persecution Mania&quot;. The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great acclaim (as well as a gas-masked mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on &quot;Persecution Mania&quot;″s cover). They subsequently toured Europe with Whiplash, Destruction, and Coroner. After that, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The resulting album, &quot;Agent Orange&quot; (1989), sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. It was this album that made Sodom famous, giving them worldwide critical acclaim, and secured their place alongside Kreator and Destruction as one of the great Teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, &quot;Agent Orange&quot; has sold more than any other German thrash metal album in the world. In support of the album, Sodom went on tour with a then-unknown Sepultura.

Problems were brewing inside of the band, however. Tom and Chris descended further into alcoholism. Furthermore, Frank had grown tired of composing music that his bandmates would often perform poorly live. Mille Petrozza offered Frank a position with his band Kreator, after they lost their second guitarist, and Frank accepted. Angelripper went out looking for a replacement and found Michael Hoffmann, formerly of German thrashers Assassin.

===Changes in formation (1990–1996)===

With a new line-up, the album &quot;Better off Dead&quot; was released in 1990, and another grueling tour in Europe followed, playing with bands like Acid Drinkers, Destruction, Accu§er, Running Wild, Coroner, Tankard and Atrocity. During the South American tour, Hoffmann decided to stay in Brazil and was therefore forced to quit. Andy Brings replaced him, and a new album was recorded, &quot;Tapping the Vein&quot; (1992), with elements of death metal. This proved to be the last album with the drummer Witchhunter: He was kicked out of the band, and Atomic Steif formerly of both Holy Moses and Living Death became his replacement behind the drum kit.

On 15 September 1991, Sodom played in Sofia, Bulgaria. The show was notable for the band because the audience of fifteen thousand people was one of the largest they had ever as a headliner. It was notable for the audience because it was the first show of a Western metal band in Bulgaria after the fall of communism (the only remotely similar event being a performance of the hard rock band Uriah Heep in 1987).

The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Get What You Deserve&quot; (1994) introduced punk-infused sound. &quot;Get What You Deserve&quot; had an arguably grotesque album cover (featuring a dead man shot and lying in his bed with a woman tied-up nearby), and many fans did not take to the band&#x27;s new direction. This period also marked the beginning of less international visibility for the band as thrash lost its commercial viability for the remainder of the 1990s, due to the rising popularity of grunge and alternative rock. Angelripper also started a solo career doing metal impressions of drinking songs, German Schlagers and even Christmas-type carols. A live album was recorded of the tour in support of the resulting album called &quot;Marooned – Live&quot;.

&quot;Masquerade in Blood&quot; added groove metal to the group&#x27;s evolving blend of crossover thrash and death metal. It was released in 1995 and the update of their style was successful. Again another guitarist had to be found. The new choice, Strahli, did not stay very long with the band. He was arrested and imprisoned on drug-related matters, and the band had since lost contact with him, until January 2011, when they learned that he had died in Düsseldorf. Atomic Steif also left and again Angelripper needed to search for new members. These were found: a guitarist in Bernemann and a drummer in Bobby Schottkowski. This line-up stabilized the band significantly and lasted until December 2010, when Schottkowski left.

===Return to thrash metal (1997–2009)===

The album &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Unite&quot; featured a controversial album cover, depicting a woman&#x27;s pregnant belly and a man&#x27;s beer gut pressing in a human skull together. This album marked the beginning of Sodom&#x27;s return to thrash but was still more along the lines of a thrash-crossover sound and had much in common with bands like Suicidal Tendencies. It also spawned the song for which Sodom would make their most famous music video, the highly-controversial song &quot;Fuck the Police&quot;. After this album, Sodom returned to the studio and released &quot;Code Red&quot; in 1999 which marked a full return to the Teutonic thrash metal sound of the 1980s, and it was met with praise from fans and press alike. A limited edition featured a bonus CD containing a tribute to Sodom album, &quot;Homage to the Gods&quot;. With 2001 came the release of &quot;M-16&quot;, a concept album about the movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, which took its title from the famed M16 assault rifle.

In 2003, a double live album was recorded in Bangkok, Thailand, titled &quot;&quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;&quot;. A new album simply titled &quot;Sodom&quot; was released in 2006, in the same vein as &quot;M-16&quot;. The title was chosen – as Angelripper explained it – &quot;because every band needs a self-titled album&quot;, and the band had never released one. The album was delayed however, because the DVD &quot;Lords of Depravity&quot; took more time to compose than initially thought.

In 2007, Tom was asked by the record label Steamhammer for any tracks to be released on the &quot;In the Sign of Evil&quot; EP. Tom believed there were, and the label floated the idea to Tom to get ex-members Chris Witchhunter and Grave Violator (real name: Franz Josef &quot;Peppi&quot; Dominik) to re-record the EP with the bonus tracks. The result became &quot;The Final Sign of Evil&quot;. Chris &quot;Witchhunter&quot; Dudek died on 7 September 2008 from liver failure after a long battle with illness.

In 2009, Sodom returned to the UK to play their first show in the country in 20 years at Bloodstock Open Air.

===Markus Makka Freiwald-era (2010–2017)===

&quot;In War and Pieces&quot;, Sodom&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, was released in Europe on 22 November 2010, and released in North America on 11 January 2011. On 30 November 2010, it was announced that Bobby Schottkowski would be leaving the band, due to &quot;personal and private problems&quot; between Tom Angelripper and Schottkowski. On 8 December 2010, Markus &quot;Makka&quot; Freiwald was announced to be Sodom&#x27;s new drummer.

In late January 2012, Sodom began writing their fourteenth studio album, which they planned to record in May 2012 for a late summer release. On 17 December 2012, the band announced the album would be released on 29 April 2013. The album is titled &quot;Epitome of Torture&quot; and features 13 tracks. The album was released in Germany on 26 April, and in the US on 7 May.

In November 2014, Sodom released the EP &quot;Sacred Warpath&quot; as a preview of their fifteenth studio album. The EP contains one original studio track, and live versions of three previously released songs.

On 9 June 2016, Sodom announced their fifteenth studio album &quot;Decision Day&quot; on their Facebook page. It was released on August 26 of that year.

Sodom released the compilation album, &quot;Demonized&quot;, on 1 September 2017. Available only on cassette and 12&quot; vinyl, it features the band&#x27;s first two demo recordings, &quot;Witching Metal&quot; from 1982 and &quot;Victims of Death&quot; from 1984.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Decision Day&quot;, Angelripper stated that Sodom had &quot;some ideas for [their] next album which [they] want to bring out in 2018.&quot;

===Reunion with Frank Blackfire Gosdzik (2017–present)===

On 3 December 2017, Sodom announced that they would reunite with three of their former guitarists Josef &quot;Grave Violator&quot; Dominic (who performed on &quot;In the Sign of Evil&quot;), Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik (&quot;Persecution Mania&quot; and &quot;Agent Orange&quot;) and Andy Brings (&quot;Tapping the Vein&quot; and &quot;Get What You Deserve&quot;) during their 35th anniversary show on 26 December in Bochum, Germany, marking the first time since Dominic, Gosdzik and Brings left the band in 1985, 1989, and 1995, respectively, that either guitarist had performed live with Sodom. Their previous performances were at Wacken in 2007. They performed three songs separate from one another&#x27;s appearances from the respective albums they appeared on.

On 5 January 2018, Angelripper announced his partings from Bernemann and Makka &quot;to pave the way for new challenges.&quot; He then said that he would introduce the new members on 7 April at the 2018 edition of the Full Metal Mountain festival, and that they would work on a new album together. Bernemann and Makka later said that they were fired from the band via WhatsApp without Angelripper listening to the new material they were working on for the band&#x27;s next album. On 22 January 2018, Angelripper announced that he had expanded the band&#x27;s line-up as a four piece. He was rejoined by guitarist Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik and added Stefan &quot;Husky&quot; Hüskens and Yorck Segatz as the band&#x27;s new drummer and second guitarist respectively. On 26 February 2018, Sodom cancelled their appearance at the Full Metal Mountain festival &quot;due to the short-term change of line-up and the restructuring of my band Sodom&quot;, as explained by Angelripper. He then said that the time was &quot;simply too short to put the new line-up in a solid live set&quot;. The new line-up of the band made their live debut on 18 May at the 2018 edition of the Rock Hard Festival. Sodom also participated in the 2018 installment of the MTV Headbangers Ball European Tour with Death Angel, Suicidal Angels and Exodus from late November to mid-December. This new lineup recorded the EPs &quot;Partisan&quot; (2018) and &quot;Out of the Frontline Trench&quot; (2019).

On 13 January 2020, drummer Stefan &quot;Husky&quot; Hüskens departed the band due to &quot;some changes at [his] full-time job, as well as a few other matters&quot;, and would not return in the future. He was replaced by Toni Merkel.

On 12 June 2020, Sodom announced that they had begun recording their sixteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Genesis XIX&quot;, at Woodhouse Studio in Hagen, Germany with producer Siggi Bemm. Mixing of the album was completed in August 2020. A month later, it was announced that the album would be released on 27 November.

On 11 May 2021, Sodom announced an upcoming EP titled &quot;Bombenhagel&quot;, containing a re-recorded version of the song &quot;Bombenhagel&quot; from their 1987 album &quot;Persecution Mania&quot; as well as two new tracks, set to be released on 20 August.

In a December 2021 interview with Rockman, Tom Angelripper revealed that Sodom had begun writing new material for their next album. A month later, Sodom was announced as one of the bands to have its contract with SPV/Steamhammer Records renewed. In May 2022, Angelripper said that the band&#x27;s new album would be released in 2023; he later stated that it would not be released until 2024. Angelripper confirmed in September 2024 that the album was finished for a late 2024 or early 2025 release.

To coincide with its 40th anniversary, Sodom released the compilation album &quot;40 Years at War – The Greatest Hell of Sodom&quot; on 28 October 2022. The set includes one song from each of the band&#x27;s studio albums between &quot;Obsessed by Cruelty&quot; and &quot;Genesis XIX&quot;, in addition to &quot;Sepulchral Voice&quot; from the &quot;In the Sign of Evil&quot; EP. The band released another EP, &quot;1982&quot;, on 10 November 2023, which includes both the title track and re-recordings of the band&#x27;s early songs.

On 31 July 2023 it was announced that Sodom (along with Kreator, Destruction and Tankard) were on the bill for the Klash of the Ruhrpott festival, which took place at Amphitheater Gelsenkirchen in Gelsenkirchen, Germany on 20 July 2024. This show marked the first time that all of the &quot;Big Teutonic Four&quot; bands had performed together.

==Musical style, influences, lyrical themes, and legacy==
In the early days Sodom&#x27;s lyrics focused on Satanic and occult themes, but since &quot;Persecution Mania&quot;, most of their songs have covered topics based on, inspired by, or related to the concepts of war, politics, fascism and world history. Some of their songs have also covered topics dealing with religion, rape or sexual intercourse, almost often presented in a humorous light. Their political-related lyrics had led some people to think that the band was militarist, but on closer observation the listener would find the lyrics actually being anti-war. In an interview with Metalkings.com Tom Angelripper said: &quot;Why are we writing about war? Because we don&#x27;t want war. We wanna describe how bad the war is.&quot; The chorus of the song &quot;Ausgebombt&quot; also gives a very clear message: &quot;No trade with death, No trade with arms, Dispense the war, Learn from the past.&quot;

Sodom has been influenced or inspired by a variety of music, including AC/DC, Accept, Anvil, Jeff Beck, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Fates Warning, Jimi Hendrix, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Mercyful Fate, Motörhead, Pink Floyd, Queen, Rainbow, Santana, Saxon, Scorpions, Slade, Slayer, Tank, Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Steve Vai, Venom and Frank Zappa. In turn, the band has influenced numerous heavy metal acts such as Burzum, Cannibal Corpse, Dark Tranquility, Deicide, Enslaved, Evildead, Evile, Incantation, Mayhem, Morbid Angel, Necrodeath, Necromantia, Obituary, Rotting Christ, Sepultura and Tsjuder.

<text>Elliott William Barnes Sadler (born April 30, 1975) is an American former professional stock car racing driver. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 10 Chevrolet Camaro for Kaulig Racing. Sadler is one of 36 drivers who have at least one win in each of NASCAR&#x27;s top three series. A native of Emporia, Virginia, he is the younger brother of former NASCAR driver Hermie Sadler.

==Racing career==
===Early racing career===
Sadler began racing in go-karts at the age of seven, and moved up to the Late Model stock car division at the local race track. His accomplishments include over 200 total wins, the 1983–84 Virginia State Karting Championship, and the North Carolina Gold Cup in 1991–92. When he turned 18, he moved to the Winston Racing Series and ran full-time beginning in 1993. That same year, he achieved his first victory. In 1995, he was crowned track champion at South Boston Speedway, winning 13 races including a 6-race winning streak.

Despite finding success in late model racing, Sadler was having a hard time catching the eye of NASCAR team owners. He sold all of his racing equipment to buy a Busch Series car, and ran some races as an independent in 1995 and early 1996. A race at Hickory Motor Speedway in early 1996 formed a connection between Sadler and Diamond Ridge Motorsports, the team he would drive for in late 1996 and all of 1997 and 1998 in the Busch Series.

===Wood Brothers Racing===

Sadler moved up to the Cup Series full-time in 1999, driving the No. 21 Ford Taurus for Wood Brothers Racing. His best finish that year was 10th at Texas Motor Speedway, and he finished 24th in points, runner-up to Tony Stewart for Rookie of the Year honors. He also returned to the Busch Series on a part-time basis, filling in for the injured Andy Santerre for Innovative Motorsports, his best finish being fifth at California Speedway. He also drove a handful of races for Lyndon Amick. Sadler&#x27;s only Top 10 finish in 2000 was 7th at Bristol, after failing to qualify at Talladega Superspeedway, and he dropped to 29th in points. 

The season also featured a chaotic crash at Michigan during practice that saw the car take flight after blowing a tire going into turn one, barrel rolling several times before coming to a rest on its wheels. Sadler recounted the story on The Dale Jr. Download in 2024, stating that the car flipped so high that it exceeded the height of the catchfence, which he attributed to a flare in the quarter panel created by the exploded tire that created lift as the car spun. He elaborated that the footage of the crash has only been seen sparingly since then because NASCAR has redacted the external camera video as to not fully reveal the nature of the incident.

In 2001, Sadler won his first Cup race at Bristol, making this the first win for Wood Brothers in eight years. He had another Top 10 run in Daytona later that year, finishing 3rd. After a run riddled with inconsistent finishes, he ended the season 20th in points. With seven Top 10&#x27;s and a fall to 23rd in points in 2002, Sadler left for Robert Yates Racing to drive the No. 38 M&amp;M&#x27;s Ford, replacing Ricky Rudd.

===Robert Yates Racing===
In 2003, his first season of competition with Robert Yates, Sadler won the pole at both Darlington Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway and finished 22nd in points. That fall, he had a vicious crash at Talladega after near-contact with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and touched the right-front fender of Kurt Busch. His car flew into the air, flipped twice, landed on his roof, spun towards the banking, and flipped six times. Sadler emerged uninjured (although he was airlifted to a local hospital for precautionary reasons).

Sadler started the 2004 season with a Top 10 finish in the Daytona 500 and six races later, he won at Texas Motor Speedway for his second career win. He stayed in the Top 10 in points all season and won at California Speedway, beating Kasey Kahne and Mark Martin. He made the Chase and finished a career-high ninth in the championship points standings. He had another flip-crash at Talladega on the final lap after he spun out and blew over onto his roof and landed on all 4 wheels and crossed the finish line in 22nd just in front of his brother, Hermie. Sadler also was uninjured in that crash, and he was even able to drive his car back to the garage.

Sadler failed to win a race again in the 2005 season; however, he did clinch four poles and finished 13th in the points standings. He also made 16 starts for Robert Yates in the Busch Series, driving the No. 90 Taurus, and had three Top 5 finishes. In 2006, Sadler won the pole at Talladega and finished 22nd in points. He made seven starts in the Busch Series and his best finish was second at Richmond. After a lack of results, he left RYR midway through 2006 for Gillett Evernham Motorsports.
Sadler, was also the cover driver for EA Sports’ NASCAR 07.

===Evernham/Petty Motorsports===
Before the start of the 2007 Daytona 500, Sadler&#x27;s team was among many others who faced disciplinary action for rule-infractions. Despite being docked 25 points, he still went on to score a season best sixth-place finish. Sadler had many ups and downs throughout the season. In 2007, Sadler led 62 laps, posted two Top 10 finishes and finished 25th in points. Sadler had the longest streak without a DNF than any other driver before failing to finish a race in 2007.

Sadler struggled in 2008, garnering only two Top 5&#x27;s, eight Top 10&#x27;s, and 16 Top 20&#x27;s. He had four DNF&#x27;s and 12 finishes of 30th or worse. Sadler led 21 laps in 2008, his fewest since the 2000 season. He ended the year 24th in the points standings. In December 2008, it was reported that A. J. Allmendinger would replace Sadler in the No. 19 Best Buy-sponsored Dodge for Gillett Evernham Motorsports in 2009. Sadler threatened a lawsuit for breach of contract; however, the lawsuit was dropped after the GEM – Petty Enterprises merger and he returned to the ride for 2009.

After all of the offseason issues, Sadler found himself in the No. 19 Stanley Tools-sponsored Dodge for Richard Petty Motorsports in the 2009 Sprint Cup Series season. In the 2009 Daytona 500, Sadler took the lead on lap 123 and stayed in the lead for the final stages in the race. On the last green flag lap Sadler got passed by Matt Kenseth and seconds later the caution came out. Kenseth wound up finishing first while Sadler came up in fifth. He ended the year 26th in points.
In 2010, Sadler returned to RPM to drive the No. 19 Ford with sponsorship from Stanley, Best Buy, and the United States Air Force. During the year, however, Sadler announced that he would be leaving the team after the 2010 season. He ran a part-time schedule in the Camping World Truck Series in the No. 2 Hunt Brothers Pizza-sponsored Chevrolet Silverado for Kevin Harvick Incorporated. In this ride, Sadler won his first NASCAR race in six years at Pocono in the Pocono Mountains 125 in July. Sadler also made a one-off start for JR Motorsports in the No. 88 Chevrolet at the Dover 200 Nationwide Series event, finishing 31st after being involved in an accident during the early stages of the race.

The next day, Sadler was involved in a wreck where he hit the inside fence (a blind spot on the track, not well-recorded by video cameras) after being hit from behind by A. J. Allmendinger. Kurt Busch was hit from behind by Jimmie Johnson causing him to spin into Clint Bowyer who received little damage but still finished 12th. The wreck was so horrific it threw the engine away from the car and caused the race to be red-flagged for 25 minutes to clean up the wreck. There were several reports by fans that his car flew through the air. With a grimace on his face, he climbed out of the car and laid down on the track. He was taken to the medical facility where he later emerged and gave an interview to on hand media personnel. He said he was fine &amp; was a little sore, but had the breath knocked out of him and had taken &quot;the hardest hit of his career&quot; at Pocono. He was proud of his team back home that had built a safe car and of the pit crew and of all of the hard work they had put into the race thus far. On August 3, Sadler announced on &quot;NASCAR Now&quot; that NASCAR told him it was the hardest head-on crash ever recorded in NASCAR history. On November 5, 2010, Sadler won the pole for the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway qualifying at 195.397, the fastest qualifying speed since 1999.

===KHI and RCR===

In late-2010, Sadler was at a crossroads in his career. He admitted in an interview that he wasn&#x27;t enjoying the sport any longer. He had gone winless for 6 seasons, and was making no progress in his efforts to winning a championship. By the persuasion of former teammate Dale Jarrett, Sadler stepped down from the Cup Series to try to make a living in the lower-divisions.

On November 5, 2010. Sadler announced a two-year deal to drive the No. 2 OneMain Financial-sponsored Chevrolet for Kevin Harvick Inc. in the Nationwide Series and also will drive a selected number of races in the Camping World Truck Series. Sadler took the championship points lead in the Nationwide Series after the eleventh race in the 2011 season. He ended up finishing second in points with 24 Top 10 finishes in 34 events.

At the end of the 2011 season, KHI&#x27;s Nationwide Series operations were absorbed by Richard Childress Racing and Sadler moved to RCR for 2012, remaining in the No. 2. In addition, Sadler ran in the 2012 Daytona 500 for RCR in the No. 33 Chevrolet.

On March 3, 2012, Sadler won the Nationwide Series Bashas&#x27; Supermarkets 200 at Phoenix, his first win since October 31, 1998 at North Carolina Motor Speedway, a span of 91 races.

Sadler had been announced on March 3 as the third driver of the Michael Waltrip Racing&#x27;s No. 55 Toyota, but Childress wanted Sadler to focus on the Nationwide championship, so the deal was nixed.

On March 17, Sadler won at Bristol, making it the first year since the mid-1990s that the first four NNS races have been won by non-Sprint Cup drivers. It also had Sadler winning two of the first four races of the season.

On July 22, Sadler held off hard charging Ricky Stenhouse Jr. at Chicagoland Speedway to collect his third win of the season, and held on to his point lead over Stenhouse and Austin Dillon.

Sadler got black flagged after supposedly jumping the restart at the inaugural Indiana 250. Elliott&#x27;s point lead vanished nearly after the black flag. The week after he dominated the U.S. Cellular 250 at Iowa en route to his fourth win of the year. Heading into Phoenix, Sadler was once again caught up in a late crash, which ended his championship hopes. He would finish second in points again to Stenhouse. He would later announce his move to Joe Gibbs Racing for 2013, taking OneMain Financial with him.

===Joe Gibbs Racing===

In addition to running the full Nationwide Series schedule for Joe Gibbs Racing, Sadler announced in March that he would be competing in three Sprint Cup Series events for the team, driving the No. 81 Toyota. Sadler ran one race with Alert Energy before it and other Caffeine gums were pulled from the market. He attempted Talladega with Doublemint but failed to qualify due to rain and not entered in fall race with no reasons.

At Loudon in 2013, Sadler was running in the top ten with 10 laps left in the race. With 6 laps to go, Sadler pulled a block on Regan Smith. The two drivers got contact that sent Sadler around into the grasses. After the race ended, Sadler and Smith argued on pit road with Sadler vowing to Smith that &quot;you will not win this championship mark my words.&quot;. Although Smith apologized, their rivalry was renewed during the inaugural race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course a few weeks later, when Smith passed Sadler for a spot through contact. When Sadler was running behind Smith a few laps later, Sadler retaliated, sending Smith into a crash collecting Ron Fellows. After medical issues forced Brian Vickers to sit out the end of the 2013 racing season, Sadler was named to drive the No. 55 MWR for the final four Sprint Cup races of 2013.

After going winless, he won the 2014 Aaron&#x27;s 312 after defending Chris Buescher and Regan Smith, It was his first win since 2012 and his first with Gibbs.

On October 31, 2014, it was announced Sadler would join Roush Fenway Racing in the No. 1 for 2015. During the O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts Challenge, Sadler became ill and exited the car during the first caution. He was relieved by Clint Bowyer.

===Roush Fenway Racing===

On October 30, 2014, Roush Fenway Racing announced that Sadler would drive the No. 1 car in the Xfinity Series in 2015. This marked Sadler&#x27;s reunion with former owner and engine builder Doug Yates, and his fourth stint with manufacturer Ford. In that season, he got 4 top 5s and 17 top 10s, although he did not get a win that season, and finished 6th in the standings.

===JR Motorsports===
On October 2, 2015, Dale Earnhardt Jr. announced that Sadler would drive for JR Motorsports in the Xfinity Series in 2016. This marked the fifth team Sadler has joined since the 2011 season when he competed for Kevin Harvick Inc. His journey has taken him from KHI to Richard Childress Racing (2012), Joe Gibbs Racing (2013–2014), Roush Fenway and now JRM. On January 6, 2016, Sadler&#x27;s car number was officially revealed as No. 1.
Sadler started out his season with a few top tens. Sadler ultimately broke through at the Sparks Energy 300 at Talladega. On the final lap, it looked like Sadler was set to being the runner-up. Sadler battled Joey Logano on the final lap. When Logano blocked, he spun out from contact from Elliott. Elliott dipped below the yellow line to avoid a spinning Joey. Brennan Poole passed Sadler for the lead just as a caution came out. After a 5-minute delay, with both drivers, Poole and Sadler, waiting on the front-stretch for NASCAR&#x27;s word, NASCAR ultimately determined that Sadler had been ahead at the moment of caution, dropping Poole to third, and elevating Sadler to first place. The finish was a 1–2 finish for JR Motorsports with Sadler winning and teammate Justin Allgaier finishing second.

Sadler would return to Victory lane at Darlington in the VFW Sport Clips Help A Hero 200, beating out Denny Hamlin. The two wins would automatically lock Sadler in the inaugural Xfinity Chase. Sadler was one of three drivers starting the chase with wins. In round one, Sadler won the race at Kentucky. Sadler, with a few more top tens, moved on to the championship four at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Sadler went on to score a runner-up finish in the championship for the third time in his career.

In 2017, Sadler returned to the Cup Series part-time with Tommy Baldwin Racing, driving the No. 7 in the Daytona 500. His last start in the Cup series was late in 2013. As one of the two fastest non-chartered cars in qualifying, he was able to lock himself into the race before the Can-Am Duels. He ended up qualifying for the next 2 plate races at Talladega in May and then Daytona in July and was going to drive in the Coca-Cola 600, but gave the ride to J. J. Yeley for an unknown reason.

In his 800th NASCAR start at Iowa&#x27;s American Ethanol E15 250, Sadler came back from the rear of the field and ended up having a great night, but was still unable to get his first win of the season. He had a great shot to win Daytona but could not, instead pushing teammate William Byron past the overtime line as a crash took place, sealing the win for Byron.

Sadler clinched the first NASCAR Xfinity Series Regular Season Championship with a fifth-place finish in the Go Bowling 250 at Richmond Raceway.

Sadler entered the night with a 91-point edge over JR Motorsports teammate William Byron and needed to come out of the race ahead by at least 61 points in the standings. Sadler finished the race 95 points ahead of Byron. Sadler was officially awarded the championship trophy and the 15 bonus points towards the NASCAR playoffs the following weekend at Chicagoland Speedway; the final race of the regular season. Despite not winning a single regular-season race, Sadler led the series with 11 top fives, an average finish of 9.5, and spent all but two weeks on top of the points standings. Sadler entered the playoffs as the third seed behind William Byron and Justin Allgaier and scored his 4th runner-up finish in the championship despite going winless. On February 17, 2018, he finished second to Tyler Reddick at Daytona International Speedway for the PowerShares QQQ 300 with a margin of 0.0004 seconds.

Sadler won the 2018 NASCAR Xfinity Series Most Popular Driver, making him the driver to win the most Most Popular Driver awards in Xfinity Series history, with four Most Popular Driver wins, winning it in 2011, 2016, 2017, and 2018.

===Kaulig Racing===

On August 15, 2018, Sadler announced that he would retire from full-time competition at the end of the 2018 Xfinity Series season. He transitioned to a part-time schedule in NASCAR in 2019, joining Kaulig Racing for a two-race Xfinity slate in 2019 at Richmond and Las Vegas.

The 2019 Rhino Pro Truck Outfitters 300 at Las Vegas was his final start in the NASCAR national series. Driving a No. 10 designed after his 1993 late model, Sadler finished tenth.

<text>Bengt Hallberg (13 September 1932 – 2 July 2013) was a Swedish jazz pianist, composer and arranger.

Born in Gothenburg, he studied classical piano from an early age, and wrote his first jazz arrangement at the age of 13. At the age of 15 he recorded his first record as a member of a group led by bassist Thore Jederby and in 1949 he recorded with the Swedish alto saxophonist Arne Domnérus for the first time, and the two musicians continued to play together for several decades.

During the 1950s, Hallberg played with leading visiting American players, including the tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, recording &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot; (originally &quot;Ack Värmeland du sköna&quot;) with him, and alto player Lee Konitz in 1951, and trumpeters Clifford Brown and Quincy Jones in 1953. Jones first recorded arrangement featured Hallberg. In the same period he worked with baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin, another leading Swedish player of the time. Both players were associated with the &#x27;Cool Jazz&#x27; scene in their country, influenced by the American school around pianist Lennie Tristano, a Hallberg favourite with whom Konitz was associated.

Hallberg had a versatile style and in his later years he wrote music for film and television, as well as choral arrangements, and he also played the accordion. With Domnerus and Georg Riedel among others, he participated in the &quot;Jazz at the Pawnshop&quot; sessions in December 1976. According to Chris Mosey, while Hallberg was: &quot;usually an extremely delicate and very measured player, [he] was obviously affected by the general ambience, and here and there cuts loose with awesome force&quot;.

Hallberg died from congestive heart failure.

<text>The chief instrument through which judicial activism has flourished in India is public interest litigation (PIL) or social action litigation (SAL). It refers to litigation undertaken to secure public interest and demonstrates the availability of justice to socially-disadvantaged parties and was introduced by Justice P. N. Bhagwati and Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer. It is a relaxation on the traditional rule of &quot;locus standi&quot;. Before 1980s the judiciary and the Supreme Court of India entertained litigation only from parties affected directly or indirectly by the defendant. It heard and decided cases only under its original and appellate jurisdictions. However, the Supreme Court began permitting cases on the grounds of public interest litigation, which means that even people who are not directly involved in the case may bring matters of public interest to the court. It is the court&#x27;s privilege to entertain the application for the PIL.

== History ==

One of the earliest public interest litigation was filed by G. Vasantha Pai who filed a case in the Madras High Court against the then sitting Chief Justice of the Madras High court S. Ramachandra Iyer after it was found the judge had forged his date of birth to avoid compulsory retirement at the age of 60 and his younger brother sent invitations to celebrate his 60th birthday and Pai found evidence after photographing his original birth register which showed his real age which was 64. Ramachandra Iyer resigned on a request from the then Chief Justice of India P. B. Gajendragadkar as the case would damage the judiciary and he had resigned before the case came up for hearing this led the case to be dismissed as he had resigned.

In December 1979, Kapila Hingorani filed a petition in regards to the condition of the prisoners detained in the Bihar jail, whose suits were pending in court. The petition was signed by prisoners of the Bihar jail and the case was filed in the Supreme Court of India before the bench headed by Justice P. N. Bhagwati. The petition was filed under the name of a prisoner, Hussainara Khatoon, and the case was therefore named &quot;Hussainara Khatoon Vs State of Bihar&quot;. The Supreme Court decided that prisoners should receive free legal aid and fast hearings. As a result, 40,000 prisoners were released from jail. Thereafter many similar cases have been registered in the Supreme Court. It was in the case of &quot;SP Gupta vs Union of India&quot; that the Supreme Court of India defined the term &quot;public interest litigation&quot; in the Indian context.

The concept of public interest litigation (PIL) is suited to the principles enshrined in Article 39A of the Constitution of India to protect and deliver prompt social justice with the help of law. Before the 1980s, only the aggrieved party could approach the courts for justice. After the emergency era the high court reached out to the people and devised a means for any person of the public (or NGO) approaching the court to seek legal remedy in cases where public interest is at stake. Bhagwati and Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer were among the first judges to admit PILs in court. Filing a PIL is not as cumbersome as a usual legal case; there have been instances when letters and telegrams addressed to the court have been heard as PILs.

The Supreme Court entertained a letter from two professors at the University of Delhi; it requested the enforcement of the constitutional right of inmates at a protective home in Agra who lived in inhuman and degrading conditions. In &quot;Miss Veena Sethi v. State of Bihar&quot;, 1982 (2) SCC 583 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 511 : AIR 1983 SC 339, the court treated a letter addressed to a judge of the court by the Free Legal Aid Committee in Hazaribagh, Bihar as a writ petition. In &quot;Citizens for Democracy through its President v. State of Assam and Others&quot;, 1995 KHC 486 : 1995 (2) KLT SN 74 : 1995 (3) SCC 743 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 600 : AIR 1996 SC 2193, the court entertained a letter from Shri Kuldip Nayar (a journalist, in his capacity as President of Citizens for Democracy) to a judge of the court alleging human rights violations of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) detainees; it was treated as a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.

==Frivolous PILs not permitted==
PIL is a &quot;rule of law&quot; declared by the courts of record. However, the person (or entity) filing the petition must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the petition serves the public interest and is not as a frivolous lawsuit brought for monetary gain. The 38th Chief Justice of India, S. H. Kapadia, has stated that substantial &quot;fines&quot; would be imposed on litigants filing frivolous PILs. His statement was widely praised because the incidence of frivolous PILs for monetary interest were on the rise. A bench of the high court had also expressed concern over the misuse of PILs. The bench issued a set of guidelines it wanted all courts in the country to observe when entertaining PILs.

In a September 2008 speech, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed concern over the misuse of PILs: “Many would argue that like in so many things in public life, in PILs too we may have gone too far. Perhaps a corrective was required and we have had some balance restored in recent times”. In what may be a tool against frivolous PILs, the Union Ministry of Law and Justice (assisted by Bhagwati and Iyer) prepared a law regulating PILs.

The judgment said: “This court wants to make it clear that an action at law is not a game of chess. A litigant who approaches the court must come with clean hands. He cannot prevaricate and take inconsistent positions”. For example, a petition drafted by Amar Singh was vague, not in conformance with the rules of procedure, and contained inconsistencies; the court did not explore his primary grievance (infringement of privacy). A positive outcome of the case was the court&#x27;s request that the government “frame certain statutory guidelines to prevent interception of telephone conversation on unauthorised requests”. In this case, Reliance Communications acted upon a forged request from police.

In &quot;Kalyaneshwari vs Union of India&quot;, the court cited the misuse of public-interest litigation in business conflicts. A writ petition was filed in the Gujarat High Court seeking the closure of asbestos units, stating that the material was harmful to humans. The high court dismissed the petition, stating that it was filed at the behest of rival industrial groups who wanted to promote their products as asbestos substitutes. A similar petition was then submitted to the Supreme Court. The plea was dismissed, and the plaintiff was assessed a fine of 100,000. The judgment read: “The petition lacks &quot;bona fide&quot; and in fact was instituted at the behest of a rival industrial group, which was interested in banning the activity of mining and manufacturing of asbestos. A definite attempt was made by it to secure a ban on these activities with the ultimate intention of increasing the demand of cast and ductile iron products as they are some of the suitable substitute for asbestos. Thus it was litigation initiated with ulterior motive of causing industrial imbalance and financial loss to the industry of asbestos through the process of court”. The court stated that it was its duty in such circumstances to punish the petitioners under the Contempt of Courts Act; it must “ensure that such unscrupulous and undesirable public interest litigation be not instituted in courts of law so as to waste the valuable time of the courts as well as preserve the faith of the public in the justice delivery system”.

“By now it ought to be plain and obvious that this Court does not approve of an approach that would encourage petitions filed for achieving oblique motives on the basis of wild and reckless allegations made by individuals, i.e., busybodies&#x27;, a bench of Justices B. Sudershan Reddy and S. S. Nijjar observed in their judgment. The bench overturned an April 2010 Andhra Pradesh High Court decision which set aside the services of a retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer employed by the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. The high court’s decision concerned a public-interest petition filed by S. Mangati Gopal Reddy, who alleged in court that the former IPS officer was involved in the loss of “300 gold dollars” from the temple and should not continue in office. The Supreme Court found that the high court decided against the accused with little information about Reddy himself.

=== Importance ===
Public interest litigation gives a wider description to the right to equality, life and personality, which is guaranteed under part III of the Constitution of India. It also functions as an effective instrument for changes in the society or social welfare. Through public interest litigation, any public or person can seek remedy on behalf of the oppressed class by introducing a PIL.

The PIL concept deviates from the traditional adversarial justice system that is followed in the common law countries (past colonies of the UK), and this construct is in fact inquisitorial in nature which permits the judges to directly participate in the investigation of the case.

=== Parties against whom PILs can be filed ===
A PIL may be filed against state government, central government, municipal authority. Also, private person may be included in PIL as ‘Respondent’, after concerned of state authority. i.e. a private factory in Mumbai which is causing pollution then public interest litigation can be filed against government of Mumbai, state pollution central board including that private factory of Mumbai.

=== Filing a PIL under article 32, 226 Constitution of India or section 133 Cr. P. C.===
The court must be satisfied that the Writ petition fulfills some basic needs for PIL as the letter is addressed by the aggrieved person, public spirited individual and a social action group for the enforcement of legal or Constitutional rights to any person who are not able to approach the court for redress. Any citizen can file a public case by filing a petition:
* Under Art 32 of the Indian Constitution, in the Supreme Court.
* Under Art 226 of the Indian Constitution, in the High Court.
* Under sec. 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in a magistrate&#x27;s court.

=== Landmark PIL cases ===

====&quot;Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan&quot;====
The case fought against sexual harassment in the workplace and was filed by Bhanwari Devi, who, after trying to stop the marriage of a one-year-old girl in rural Rajasthan, was raped by five men. She faced numerous problems when she (Devi) attempted to seek justice. Naina Kapoor decided to initiate a PIL to challenge sexual harassment at workplace in the Supreme Courts.

The judgement of the case recognized sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental constitutional rights of Articles 14, 15, and 21. The guidelines also directed for sexual harassment prevention.

==== &quot;M. C. Mehta v. Union of India&quot; ====
The court shut down numerous industries and allowed them to reopen only after controlled pollution disposal in the Ganga basin.

==Impact of PIL ==
A controversial study by social scientist Hans Dembowski concluded that PILs had been successful in making official authorities accountable to NGOs. While Dembowski also found some effect at the grassroots level, PIL cases dealing with major environmental grievances in the Kolkata urban agglomeration did not tackle underlying problems (such as inadequate town planning). Dembowsk wrote about it in his book, &quot;Taking the State to Supreme Court - Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India&quot; which was originally published by Oxford University Press in 2001. The publisher, however, discontinued distribution because of contempt of court proceedings initiated by the Calcutta High Court. The author, who claimed he was never officially notified by the court, republished the book online with German NGO Asia House.

PILs have failed to provide justice to the poor and needy in whose name it was initiated. In a path breaking report published in 2005, it was opined that PILs instead of helping the poor are adversely affecting their homes and livelihoods. It has in effect become an industry. The Report demanded an independent study to be conducted on the impact of PILs.

PIL Dravyavati River by Committee for Protection of Public Properties

Earlier, the princely state of Jaipur used to get water from this river by making a canal, later this river turned into a dirty drain. There are more than 160 tubewells around it. Those who are giving water to the city. There have been infections in many tube wells. The State Human Rights Commission took cognizance of the transition to water in the year 2001. A citizens committee became a party to the case and decided that the river should be brought in its original form. Expert committee was formed. In 2007, when no action was ruled on the case, the PIL of the river was presented. Many constructions were broken and currently the river is 48 km long. Influential people bought land at the cost of Kodis from poor accountants in the river and did not allow the original width of the river to be restored. The current width is 210 feet. Later Tata projects worked on the rejuvenation of Dravyavati river projects with the Jaipur Development Authority. Rapid urbanisation in the last 3-4 decades, coupled with rampant encroachments in the river area and its catchment areas and the dumping of sewage, industrial waste water, and solid waste, converted this once pristine flowing river to a Nallah. In the first-of-its-kind river rejuvenation activity, the Dravyavati River Project will oversee the amortisation of 170 MLD polluted water and have more than 100 fall structures constructed to turn this rain side river to a perennial river. More than 18,000 trees were planted and 65,000 square meters green area developed under this project.

Public interest litigation on publication of property list of princely state of Rajasthan Article 12 (1) and (II) of the agreement provides that immovable properties of former princely states which were public properties of the princely state on August 15, 1947, will be transferred to the state. In this way, two lists were to be made, if there is a dispute over the property of the transferring property to a new state and the personal property of the other princely states, then the Court will not have the right of trial under Article 363 of the Constitution and the State Ministry of the Government of India (the current home). The decision will be final, the former princely states made a single list and made entire public properties their own. Bhajpa Congress governments kept silence. Public interest litigation is presented in this regard. See detail HIGHCORT site and attached writ petition. D B Civil Writ (P) 10655/15 Writ Petition was submitted regarding the cradle of the agreement reached with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and 563 former princely states of the country and 18 princely states of Rajasthan.

==Further considerations==
A bench consisting of Justices G. S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly pointed out that laws enacted for achieving the goals set out in the Preamble to the Constitution were inadequate; the benefits of welfare measures embodied in the legislation had not reached millions of poor people, and efforts to bridge the gap between rich and poor did not yield the desired results.

Singhvi wrote, in a case concerning sewage workers: “The most unfortunate part of the scenario is that whenever one of the three constituents of the state i.e., the judiciary issues directions for ensuring that the right to equality, life, and liberty no longer remains illusory for those who suffer from the handicap of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance, and directions are given for implementation of the laws enacted by the legislature for the benefit of the have-nots, a theoretical debate is started by raising the bogey of judicial activism or overreach”.

The bench clarified that it was necessary to erase the impression on some that the superior courts, by entertaining PIL petitions for the poor who could not seek protection of their rights, exceeded the unwritten boundaries of their jurisdiction. The judges said it was the duty of the judiciary to protect the rights of every citizen and ensure that all lived with dignity.

Such cases may be filed for public interest when victims lack the capability to commence litigation or their freedom to petition the court has been blocked. The court may proceed &quot;sua sponte&quot;, or cases can proceed on the petition of an individual or group. Courts may also proceed on the basis of letters written to them or newspaper reports.

The Centre for Law and Policy Research, Bangalore (CLPR) hosts a Public Interest Lawyering Hub, where resources on PIL are available.

<doc id="974702" wikidata="Q5924351" url="?curid=974702" title="Hso Khan Pha">
<text>Prince Hso Khan Pha of Yawnghwe (, aka Tiger; 15 April 1938 – 4 October 2016) was a prince of Yawnghwe. He was a son of Sao Shwe Thaik, the Saopha of Yawnghwe and Sao Nang Hearn Kham, the Mahadevi (consort). He was a consulting geologist based in Canada.

==Education==
His education was first started at a local school in Yawnghwe (Nyaung Shwe) at convents run by Roman Catholic Church nuns at Kalaw and Hsenwi (Theinni) in the Shan State, later in 1949 attended The Doon School at Dehra Dun (Dehradun) in India, graduating in 1954; studied for two years at Rangoon University; attended the Bell School of Languages at Cambridge, England, and the Cambridgeshire Technical College; graduated in 1964 from the University of Keele, England, with a BA (Hons) in Geology and Political Institutions.

==Life==
His mother fled with her family to Thailand in October 1963 after Sao Shwe Thaik had been deposed and died in prison in November 1962. Upon crossing the Thai border, the Provincial governor called on the Mahadevi with a message of protection from the king. During her time in Thailand she organized and founded the Shan State War Council (SSWC) and Shan State Army (of resistance to Ne Win’s dictatorship) in 1964. She became its leader and commander-in-chief and her second son Chao Tzang served as her right-hand man. At the time of his father’s death, he was studying in England. While in exile he participated in the independence struggle of the Shan State. Hso Khan Pha was politically active in many groups, pressuring the government of Burma. He also worked with Shan exiles abroad to help provide schooling for displaced Shan children whose parents were unable to send them to school. He tried to make the Shan State an independent country. The case has been presented to many heads of state in western countries as well as to the United Nations. He was proclaimed Head of State and President of the Federated Shan States, declared Shan State independence, by Shan State exiles and sympathizers in 2005.

Hso Khan Pha worked with exiled Prince Shwebomin of Burma to promote the protection of the Shan People&#x27;s religious, traditional, culture, and indigenous land rights in Burma. In 2007, he attended an international peace conference in Los Angeles to speak out against the government of Burma.

Upon graduating he was hired as a geologist in England, and went to prospect for diamonds in the Ivory Coast. West Africa, for the DeBeers, Diamond Corporation Limited; in 1966 transferred to Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company Limited, starting first in Flin Flon, Manitoba, and on to exploration projects in Ontario and Quebec; joined Mattagami Lake Mines as a Senior Exploration Geologist in 1970; in 1972 became Senior Project Geologist in charge of all explorations in western Canada; opened the Western Exploration Office for Mattagami Lake Mines in Edmonton, 1975; became an independent geological consultant in 1976, working briefly in 1977 for Alberta Environment; in 1978 started consulting in the oil-patch; sought the Liberal nomination in the federal riding of Elk Island in April 1993.

He died in his sleep of a heart attack on 4 October 2016.

==Associations==

*Founding member and past President of the human rights society - Burma Watch International.
*Royal Alberta United Services Institute; Associate of the Garrison Officers Club, Mewata Armouries, Calgary.

==Family==
Tiger married Rosemary Catherine Otte in 1976 and had four children, including: Rebecca Sanda-Devi, Haŏ Shwe-Thaike, Jessica Ying Sita, and Hsŏ Kham-Serk.

==Genealogy==
The Yawnghwe royal family is descended from King Beingyayett (who ruled in 661-600 BC). The family ruled in what is now northern Burma and southwestern China. In 1358, the Saopha (King/Ruler) Si Hseng Hpa, a direct ancestor of this family formed his capital at Yawnghwe.
In 1850, Sao Suu Deva, Crown Prince of Yawnghwe, was assassinated by a rival claimant. King Mindon of Burma helped Prince Deva&#x27;s son Sao Maung (aka Sir Sao Maung - knighted by George V of the United Kingdom) regain the crown of Yawnghwe. In 1927, Sao Shwe Thaike ascended the throne of Yangwhe, succeeding his uncle Sao Maung.

Sao Shwe Thaike (b. October 1896) was instrumental in laying the foundation in 1945 for what was to become the Union of Burma in 1948. Thaike served as President of the Constitutional Assembly and was elected by Parliament to serve as the first President of the Union in 1948. On 4 January 1948 Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, handed the Union of Burma its independence.

The Mahadevi Sao Nang Hearn Kham (b. May 1916), Tiger’s mother, is sister to Saopha of Hsenwi, another ancient House. It is said by some Thai scholars that King Ramakhamheng of Sukhothai (the 13th Century precursor of modern Thailand ) was a scion of the House of Hsenwi.

*&quot;I support all ethnic groups&#x27; rights to have their own federal states, probably in US style or Canadian style. I understand that Quebec Province in Canada is an autonomic federal state. Shan state can be like that?&quot;.
