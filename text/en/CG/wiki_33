<text>Air is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key, a brand of Visual Arts. It was released on September 8, 2000 for Windows as an adult game. Key later released versions of &quot;Air&quot; without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Switch. The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki, a traveling showman searching for the &quot;girl in the sky&quot;. He arrives in a quiet, seaside town where he meets three girls, one of whom is the key to the end of his journey.

The gameplay in &quot;Air&quot; follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the player character. The game is divided into three segments—Dream, Summer, and Air—which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. &quot;Air&quot; has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.

Following the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Air&quot; made several transitions into other media. A manga by Yukimaru Katsura was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Comptiq&quot;, and later published into two volumes. Comic anthologies and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several albums of music. Kyoto Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series and a two-episode anime mini-series in 2005, and Toei Animation produced an anime film in 2005. The anime adaptations are licensed by Funimation who released them in North America.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Air&quot; is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story&#x27;s narrative and dialogue. &quot;Air&quot; follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.

There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, three which are initially available and two more which can later become available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.

When first playing the game, the player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki and the scenarios for the three heroines are available in what is called the Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player. Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of &quot;Air&quot; without the erotic content.

==Plot==
===Setting and themes===
There are important locations featured in &quot;Air&quot; that are based on places in the city Kami in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. &quot;Air&quot; is set in the Kasumi district of Kami; during the course of the series&#x27; creation, Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami. Many of the locales in &quot;Air&quot;, such as the seawall, the train station, the shrine, and the school are based on real places. As &quot;Air&quot; is set in the middle of summer, the season offers bright, sunny skies for the town during the day. In the manga adaptation, the town is described as a &quot;quiet town with few people...with nothing but beaches and countryside.&quot; Scenario assistant Yūichi Suzumoto has commented that his impression of &quot;Air&quot; is similar to that of a folk song due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression.

As indicated by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the &quot;girl in the sky&quot;, and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi who is a member of the astronomy club, and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for &quot;sky&quot;. Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines&#x27; stories, as well as Yukito&#x27;s, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with &quot;Air&quot;, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic. Uraha, Yukito&#x27;s mother, and Yukito himself have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.

===Characters===

The player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of &quot;Air&quot;. He lives a poor life going from town to town with little money, trying to make a living off his show with a puppet. As a young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of &quot;Air&quot;, makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase &quot;gao&quot; when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction &quot;romantic&quot;. As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.

The second of the three heroines Yukito meets after Misuzu is Kano Kirishima, a girl attending the same school as Misuzu. She is usually energetic, playful, and tells jokes by saying nonsensical things. Kano is friends with a strange stray dog named Potato that follows her around and is able to communicate in his strange manner of speech. Kano still believes in things she was told by her older sister Hijiri as a child as a way of coping with her past. The third and final heroine Yukito meets is a girl in Misuzu&#x27;s class at school named Minagi Tohno, a top student in the school who is introverted as well. Until she met Yukito, her only friend was Michiru, with whom she often blows bubbles at the abandoned train station in town.

===Story===
&quot;Air&quot; story begins on Monday, July 17, 2000, when traveling street performer Yukito Kunisaki arrives at a small seaside town. As a young adult, he has been traveling around Japan in continuation of his late mother&#x27;s search for the &quot;girl in the sky&quot; who, according to a family legend, has been cursed to spend eternity all alone. Yukito&#x27;s sole way of earning money is by performing a puppet show by moving a doll that has been passed down in his family with magic, but he fails to gain anyone&#x27;s attention by doing so in this town. The next day, he meets Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy high school girl who is eager to become friends with him. He accepts her offer to eat lunch at her home, and Misuzu&#x27;s aunt and foster mother Haruko Kamio is later persuaded to let him stay for the time being. A few days later, Yukito meets two other girls who go to Misuzu&#x27;s school—Kano Kirishima and Minagi Tohno—who, like Misuzu, have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. As Yukito grows closer to Misuzu, he realizes from the dreams she has been telling him about that she is in fact the girl in the sky. Yukito recalls his mother telling him that after the dreams, the girl in the sky would start to first physically weaken, followed by feeling pain from an unknown source, then forgetting about those closest to her, and finally be doomed to die alone. Yukito realizes that his mother had once had her own encounter with the girl in the sky, but she had been unable to save her from her fate. Ultimately, Yukito decides to stay with Misuzu, regretting that he did not play with her more when they first met. Yukito uses all of the accumulated wishes that his ancestors have imputed into the doll to grant his own wish to stay by Misuzu&#x27;s side, and as a result, Yukito disappears.

In the summer 1,000 years prior during the Heian period, Kanna is one of the last winged beings who has been held prisoner at a Shinto shrine for much of her life. Kanna is set to be executed following a political change in the Imperial Court, but she escapes with the help of Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and her loyal retainer Uraha. They decide to go in search of Kanna&#x27;s mother Yaobikuni, who according to rumor is imprisoned somewhere south of Kanna&#x27;s shrine. Although they eventually find Yaobikuni and free her, she is killed by a group of archers soon after. In an attempt to save Ryūya and Uraha, Kanna sacrifices herself, leaving herself cursed by Buddhist monks to relive painful memories in the sky for eternity. This eventually weakens but does not go away entirely, allowing Kanna to continuously reincarnate as a human girl, with Misuzu being one such reincarnation.

Yukito&#x27;s final wish to stay with Misuzu is granted in the form of his memories inhabiting a young crow Misuzu finds on July 16, 2000 and names Sora. The events of the previous timeline with Yukito play out again, but after Yukito disappears after the doll grants his wish, Yukito&#x27;s memories within Sora surface, allowing him to give Misuzu the necessary encouragement to be strong until the end. Haruko tries to show Misuzu more affection than she has over the past ten years they have been living together, but by this point, Misuzu&#x27;s condition continues to worsen, eventually mentally reverting to how she was when she and Haruko first met. Haruko continues to care for Misuzu, and Misuzu shows that she truly cares for Haruko by choosing to stay with her instead of leaving with her father. Haruko and Misuzu spend the next three days together as mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu&#x27;s death. As a result of Misuzu dying happily with her family, it is implied that she takes her happy memories back to Kanna, effectively breaking the curse. Metaphysically, Yukito&#x27;s and Misuzu&#x27;s present incarnations are shown to be a young boy and girl playing on the beach on July 17, 2000 as they are watched by Misuzu with Yukito asleep next to her.

==Development==
After the release of Key&#x27;s debut game &quot;Kanon&quot; (1999), video game director and Key co-founder Naoki Hisaya resigned from Key. Hisaya had led the planning of &quot;Kanon&quot; and was its main scenario writer in conjunction with fellow Key co-founder Jun Maeda. Hisaya&#x27;s resignation resulted in Maeda leading the planning for Key&#x27;s next work, with Maeda wanting to produce something different from not only &quot;Kanon&quot;, but also &quot;Moon&quot; (1997) and &quot;&quot; (1998) that Maeda and other founding members of Key worked on previously as part of the brand Tactics under video game publisher Nexton. Maeda put pressure on himself to make something structurally different from &quot;Kanon&quot;, but he also took it upon himself following Hisaya&#x27;s resignation to continue to produce &quot;crying games&quot; for Key&#x27;s fan base. As with &quot;Kanon&quot;, Maeda wanted to write a moving story that would leave a strong impression on the player, but &quot;Air&quot; was not intentionally written to be soothing to the player despite this being a common impression by fans in October 2000. The concept for &quot;Air&quot; was one of several types of stories Maeda had wanted to write, and he chose to go with what would later become &quot;Air&quot; after careful consideration, along with taking into account the responses from people who had played &quot;Kanon&quot;.

According to writer and critic Shūichirō Sarashina, a common aspect of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games at the time was to treat the individual heroine routes equally, producing a coherent narrative as a result of a sum of its parts, and he notes that &quot;Kanon&quot; also followed this pattern. Maeda focused on straying from this pattern because he wanted players to experience the entire story as a whole, but he still wanted its content to be enjoyable as a &quot;bishōjo&quot; game so that as many people as possible would be satisfied by it. In doing so, Maeda kept the basic structure of having multiple heroine routes, but he realized that he could not give each character the same level of focus. When developing the plot, the basic structure of having multiple points of view and an overarching storyline had already been solidified, which according to Maeda was not something he was aware of having been done in visual novels at the time. Fellow scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto was apprehensive about this structure when he first heard about the plot from Maeda, but &quot;Air&quot; executive producer and Visual Arts president Takahiro Baba had already given his approval for the project by then. In addition to Maeda and Suzumoto, Takashi Ishikawa is also listed as one of the main scenario writers. Scenario assistance was provided by Kai, Tōya Okano and Tomotaka Fujii.

In terms of gameplay, &quot;Air&quot; was designed to emphasize its story compared to its adventure game elements, with the development team opting to include very few choices to diverge the plot, which Maeda later regretted. According to Suzumoto, some players complained that &quot;Air&quot; did not feel like a game as a result, and that some found it boring because of a lack of these choices. Three heroine routes were developed to show a range of different possibilities the player character Yukito Kunisaki could take in parallel universes. In doing so, Maeda wanted to show that small variations can diverge Yukito&#x27;s ultimate fate. In the planning stage, Maeda did not specifically include adult content due at least in part to his self-described inability to write detailed sex scenes. Maeda believed that people would have bought the game even without adult content, but he noted that this would have been impossible in the past. Suzumoto pointed out how most of the sex scenes in &quot;Kanon&quot; could be avoided, and although this is similar to how &quot;Air&quot; is structured, Suzumoto was one of the writers who made it so that at least two sex scenes in &quot;Air&quot; would be unavoidable.

Itaru Hinoue is the chief artist and character designer for &quot;Air&quot;, continuing from her position with &quot;Kanon&quot;. Further computer graphics were split between three artists—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Maeda, Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before &quot;Kanon&quot; release.

==Adaptations==


===Print===
A short story, titled and written by Yūichi Suzumoto, was published in the &quot;Kanowo&quot; appendix to Kadokawa Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Comptiq&quot; magazine on December 1, 2000. Jive published two volumes of an anthology titled &quot;Air Anthology Novel&quot; between September 1 and December 1, 2004.

An &quot;Air&quot; manga was serialized in the Japanese computer game magazine &quot;Comptiq&quot; between August 10, 2004, and February 10, 2006. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate volumes published by Kadokawa Shoten. The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it, and was illustrated by Japanese artist Yukimaru Katsura. Between the two volumes, there are 15 main chapters (nine in volume one and six in volume two), and two bonus chapters included at the end of each volume. The manga version goes through the Dream and Air arcs in detail while the Summer arc is only touched upon briefly throughout the manga. The main focus is on Misuzu&#x27;s story with Kano and Minagi serving as minor characters in comparison. However, Minagi&#x27;s story is explained in the bonus installment at the end of volume two.

There are also five sets of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title &quot;Air Comic Anthology&quot;, was released on January 25, 2001, under their &quot;DNA Media Comics&quot; label. Volumes for this series continued to be released until December 25, 2001, with the seventh volume.

Each of the anthology series are written and drawn by an average of 20 people per volume.

===Drama CDs===
There were nine drama CDs released based on &quot;Air&quot; released by Lantis. The first three focused solely on each of the main heroines separately per CD where the cover of the album would depict which of the girls to be presented. These three albums were released on August 24, 2005. The next set of three was done the same way and released on October 21, 2005. The last three were released in one month increments after the second batch of three drama CDs went on sale. The seventh CD focused on the events of the Summer arc in the story while the last two were based on the Air arc. At least the last CD released on January 25, 2006, contained original stories in addition to the story from the visual novel.

===Anime series===
On November 17, 2004, a teaser DVD named &quot;Air prelude&quot; was produced containing interviews with the anime&#x27;s cast, clean opening and ending theme video sequences, and promotional footage of the anime itself; it was a limited edition DVD, with only 20,000 copies produced. The anime television series is produced by Kyoto Animation, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, written by Fumihiko Shimo, and features character design by Tomoe Aratani who based the designs on Itaru Hinoue&#x27;s original concept. Thirteen episodes were produced by Kyoto Animation: 12 regular episodes, and a final recap episode which summarizes Misuzu&#x27;s story arc. The anime also follows the game by splitting the series into three parts; Dream (episodes one through seven), Summer (episodes eight and nine), and Air (episodes 10 through 12), with the recap episode (episode 13) following. The episodes aired between January 6 and March 31, 2005, on the BS-i Japanese television network. The theme songs from the &quot;Air&quot; visual novel are used for the anime&#x27;s opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. After the conclusion of the anime series, a mini-series which added to the Summer arc of the story called &quot;Air in Summer&quot; aired on August 28 and September 4, 2005, a week later on BS-i. &quot;Air in Summer&quot; consisted of two episodes and was produced by the same staff as the anime series.

A DVD released on March 31, 2005, called &quot;Air Memories&quot; contained promotional commercials for the series, staff commentaries, and clean ending sequences from the 12th and 13th episodes, lasting 92 minutes. The episodes were released to Region 2 DVD between April 6 and September 7, 2005, by Pony Canyon in limited and regular editions containing two episodes per volume. The DVD for &quot;Air in Summer&quot; was later released on October 5, 2005, in Japan.

An &quot;Air&quot; animated film directed by Osamu Dezaki premiered in Japanese theaters on February 5, 2005. The film, animated by Toei Animation, is a reinterpretation of the original &quot;Air&quot; storyline which centers on the story arc of the female lead Misuzu Kamio. Yukito Kunisaki arrives in the town of Kami for a chance to earn money at the summer festival and meets Misuzu on his first day in town. They soon become friends and a story one thousand years old begins to unfold.

==Music==

The visual novel has three main theme songs: the opening theme , the ending theme &quot;Farewell song&quot;, and as an insert song. Each song is sung by Lia of I&#x27;ve Sound and the lyrics were written by Jun Maeda. Five of the characters have leitmotifs, or background music theme songs—the three heroines, Kanna, and Michiru. Misuzu&#x27;s theme is ; Kano&#x27;s theme is ; Minagi&#x27;s theme is ; Kanna&#x27;s theme is ; lastly, Michiru&#x27;s theme is . Of the six music tracks not used in the visual novel, but of which were included on the game&#x27;s original soundtrack, the first two were failed attempts at creating a theme for Minagi.

The first album, &quot;Ornithopter&quot;, came bundled with the original release of &quot;Air&quot; in September 2000. The next album was released in August 2001 as a maxi single titled &quot;Natsukage / Nostalgia&quot; containing a vocal version of &quot;Natsukage&quot;, and a B-side track; both songs were sung by Lia and the rest of the single was produced by Jun Maeda. The game&#x27;s original soundtrack was released in September 2002 containing two discs with 31 different tracks along with remix and instrumental versions of the opening and ending themes. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called &quot;Re-feel&quot; which contained five tracks from &quot;Air&quot; and five from &quot;Kanon&quot;. An EP containing original versions of the three theme songs and remixed versions of the opening and ending themes was released in May 2006 called &quot;Air Analog Collector&#x27;s Edition: Tori no Uta / Farewell song&quot;. Each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key&#x27;s record label Key Sounds Label. The film&#x27;s original soundtrack was released in March 2005 by Frontier Works. A bonus symphony CD titled &quot;Shinwa e no Izanai&quot; was released with the special edition &quot;Air&quot; film DVD on August 5, 2005. Overall, &quot;Air&quot; music has been well received, and the original soundtrack for the visual novel has met with high sales. The opening theme was involved in copyright infringement in 2005.

==Reception and sales==
According to a national ranking of how well bishōjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original &quot;Air&quot; PC release premiered at number one in the rankings. The game ranked twice at 42 in November and December 2000, at 20 in January 2001, and twice more at 42 through February 2001. The original release appeared on the charts twice more: the first in late September to early October 2001 at 26, and again in the last two weeks of May 2002, ranking in at 43. The regular edition of the &quot;Air&quot; PC release premiered at number 13, ranked in at number 41 in the following ranking, and 42 in the ranking after that. The PC all ages version premiered at number seven in the rankings and had a final ranking at 30 in the next ranking. The &quot;Air Standard Edition&quot; premiered at number one in the rankings. The &quot;Air Standard Edition&quot; ranked in twice more, at 34 and at 28 in the next two rankings. &quot;Air&quot; was the highest selling game of 2000 selling 102,080 units, which was about 25,000 more units than the second highest game, &quot;Inagawa de Ikō!&quot;. The Dreamcast version sold 42,445 units in its first week, and was the fourth highest selling console game in Japan that week. The video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored this version a 30 out of 40, and it ultimately sold 50,406 units to rank as the 53rd highest selling Japanese Dreamcast game ever, as of 2007. NTT Publishing reported that over 300,000 units of &quot;Air&quot; have been sold.

&quot;Air&quot; was described as a game that stands out, much like Key&#x27;s first title &quot;Kanon&quot;, due to an intricate plot that keeps the player interested, and has a good replay value as well. In an interview of Jun Maeda and Yūichi Suzumoto, they were both surprised to find out that the Japanese public (in March 2001) felt &quot;Air&quot; to be a soothing game, but Maeda and Suzumoto made it clear that this impression is completely at odds with their impression of the game, and they remark that there was not one person who worked on &quot;Air&quot; who thought that. Characters from &quot;Air&quot; have appeared in dōjin works not directly based on the &quot;Air&quot; series. Games such as &quot;Eternal Fighter Zero -Blue Sky Edition-&quot; by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from &quot;Air&quot; or from the earlier Key games &quot;Kanon&quot; or &quot;&quot;. In the October 2007 issue of &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, &quot;Air&quot; ranked eighth with 43 votes.

<text>Boing Boing is a website, first established as a zine in 1988, later becoming a group blog. Common topics and themes include technology, futurism, science fiction, gadgets, intellectual property, Disney, and left-wing politics. It twice won the Bloggies for Weblog of the Year, in 2004 and 2005. The editors are Mark Frauenfelder, David Pescovitz, Carla Sinclair, and Rob Beschizza, and the publisher is Jason Weisberger.

One report named &quot;Boing Boing&quot; as the most popular blog in the world until 2006, when Chinese-language blogs became popular; it remained among the most widely linked and cited blogs into the 2010s.

==History==
&quot;Boing Boing&quot; (originally bOING bOING) started as a zine in 1988 by married duo Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair. Issues were subtitled &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Neurozine&quot;. Associate editors included Gareth Branwyn, Jon Lebkowsky, Paco Nathan, and David Pescovitz. Along with &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; was an influence in the development of the cyberpunk subculture. It reached a maximum circulation of 17,500 copies. The last issue of the zine was #15.

&quot;Boing Boing&quot; was established as a website in 1995; it became a web-only publication one year later. While researching for an article about blogs in 1999, Frauenfelder became acquainted with the Blogger software. He relaunched &quot;Boing Boing&quot; as a weblog on 21 January 2000, describing it as a &quot;directory of wonderful things&quot;. Over time, Frauenfelder was joined by four co-editors: Doctorow, Pescovitz, Jardin and Beschizza, all of whom previously contributed to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Maggie Koerth-Baker, after a run as a guest blogger in 2009, joined the site as its Science Editor, leaving to join a Nieman Foundation fellowship in 2014.

In September 2003, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; removed their Quicktopics user-comment feature without warning or explanation. Bloggers commenting on the change at the time speculated that it stemmed from &quot;identity impersonators and idiot flamers&quot; pretending to be co-editors. Xeni Jardin was a guest on the &quot;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; to discuss &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s decision to remove its Comments section on its website, and she spoke from her experience at &quot;Boing Boing.&quot; In August 2007, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; staff launched a redesigned site, which included a restored comment facility, moderated by Teresa Nielsen Hayden. In 2013, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; switched from the proprietary Disqus comment system to Discourse, an open-source internet forum developed by Jeff Atwood, Robin Ward and Sam Saffron.

In 2004, the project incorporated as Happy Mutants LLC, and John Battelle became the blog&#x27;s business manager. &quot;Boing Boing&quot;, by the mid-2000s, &quot;had become one of the most-read and linked-to blogs in the world&quot; according to &quot;Fast Company.&quot;

The site added advertising over the course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site&#x27;s RSS feed as well. Editor Cory Doctorow noted that &quot;John [Battelle] said it&#x27;s going to be harder to make a little money to pay your bandwidth bills than it will be to make a lot of money and have a real source of income from this.&quot; The advertising income during the first quarter was already $27,000, and , &quot;Boing Boing&quot; still &quot;makes a nice living for its founders and a handful of contract employees&quot;, but it is no longer a member of Battelle&#x27;s blog network Federated Media Publishing, Inc.

&quot;Boing Boing&quot; featured a &quot;guest blogger&quot; sidebar, then stopped the series in summer of 2004. In 2008, the &quot;guest blogger&quot; series was resumed, with guests posting in the main blog for two-week periods. Guests have included Charles Platt, John Shirley, Mark Dery, Tiffany Lee Brown, Karen Marcelo of Survival Research Laboratories, Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom, Rudy Rucker, Gareth Branwyn, Wiley Wiggins, Jason Scott of textfiles.com, Jessamyn West of librarian.net, journalists Danny O&#x27;Brien and Quinn Norton and comedian John Hodgman.

In September 2006, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; introduced a weekly podcast, &quot;Boing Boing Boing&quot;, intended to cover the week&#x27;s posts and upcoming projects. The show&#x27;s cast consists of the &quot;Boing Boing&quot; editors, accompanied by a weekly guest. In the same month, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; introduced a second podcast called &quot;Get Illuminated&quot;, which features interviews with writers, artists, and other creatives.

The site&#x27;s own original content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license, as of November 2019.

In September 2009, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; refused to comply with a demand from Polo Ralph Lauren&#x27;s lawyers to remove a post concerning a heavily manipulated image of model Filippa Hamilton, originally published by the Photoshop Disasters blog. The latter was forced to comply with the company&#x27;s demand by its hosting provider. Ralph Lauren issued DMCA takedown notices to &quot;Boing Boing&quot;″s ISP and Blogspot, which hosts Photoshop Disasters, claiming their use of the image infringed copyright. Blogspot complied, but &quot;Boing Boing&quot;″s ISP consulted with &quot;Boing Boing&quot; and agreed that the image was fair use. As a result, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; issued a mocking rebuttal, using the same image again and posting the takedown notice.

The rebuttal was widely reported, including on frequently viewed websites such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and ABC News.

On 3 May 2011, the first podcast of &quot;Gweek&quot; was released. &quot;Gweek&quot; is a podcast in which the editors and friends of &quot;Boing Boing&quot; talk about comic books, science fiction and fantasy, video games, TV shows, music, movies, tools, gadgets, apps, and other &quot;neat&quot; stuff. In the first episode of &quot;Gweek&quot;, Rob Beschizza and Mark Frauenfelder discussed subjects such as the video game &quot;Portal 2&quot;, graphic novels, upcoming science fiction books, and recommendations of some of their favorite adventure games for mobile platforms. &quot;Boing Boing&quot; has since added several other podcasts.

In November 2017, the site was sued by &quot;Playboy&quot;, which alleged that a hyperlink to copyright-infringing content at Imgur and YouTube was itself illegal. A Federal Court dismissed &quot;Playboy″s&quot; claims on 14 February 2018 and Playboy released a statement suggesting that it was standing down on 28 February.

Cory Doctorow left &quot;Boing Boing&quot; in January 2020, and soon started a solo blogging project titled &quot;Pluralistic&quot;. The circumstances surrounding Doctorow&#x27;s exit from the website were unclear at the time, although Doctorow acknowledged that he remained a co-owner of &quot;Boing Boing&quot;. MetaFilter described the end of the 19-year association between Doctorow and &quot;Boing Boing&quot; as &quot;the equivalent of the Beatles breaking up&quot; for the blog world. Doctorow&#x27;s exit was not acknowledged by Boing Boing, with his name being quietly removed from the list of editors on 29 January 2020.

==Unicorn chaser==
A &quot;unicorn chaser&quot; is a practice created by &quot;Boing Boing&quot; editors as an antidote to blog postings linking to sites containing disgusting or shocking images. The shocking post would be immediately followed by another post containing a picture of a unicorn. Xeni Jardin posted the first one (titled &quot;And now, we pause for a Unicorn Moment.&quot;) in August 2003 as a reply to a picture of a rash posted by editor Mark Frauenfelder in an attempt to get readers to diagnose it for him. It has also been used as an antidote for posts containing photos of a brain tumor, a man who pumped up the skin of his face with saline solution, many different ways to clean one&#x27;s earwax, and a lengthy discussion of the Internet video &quot;2 Girls 1 Cup&quot;.

On 18 May 2007, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; announced that Virgin America, as part of its &quot;Name Our Planes!&quot; campaign, would be naming one of its new aircraft &quot;Unicorn Chaser&quot;, after having asked &quot;Boing Boing&quot; to suggest a name. An Airbus A320 with registration code N626VA eventually joined the fleet with that name.

==Boing Boing Gadgets and Offworld==
In August 2007, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; introduced a gadgets-focused companion site headed by former &quot;Gizmodo&quot; editor Joel Johnson. Johnson left in July 2009, to be replaced by Rob Beschizza, formerly of &quot;Wired News&quot;. Other writers include Steven Leckart and Lisa Katayama. Offworld, a blog covering video games edited by Brandon Boyer, was added in November 2008. These sites were incorporated into Boing Boing itself around 2010. Plans to revive the Offworld site were announced in 2015, with Leigh Alexander as Editor-in-Chief and Laura Hudson as Editor. Leigh Alexander and Laura Hudson left Offworld in early 2016 after publishing a collection of selected articles, successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in March 2016.

==Boing Boing TV==
In October 2007, &quot;Boing Boing&quot; started a new component, &quot;Boing Boing TV&quot;, that consists of video segments including &quot;SPAMasterpiece Theater&quot; (2008) with John Hodgman, produced by its co-editors in conjunction with DECA, the &quot;Digital Entertainment Corporation of America&quot;. Art tech group monochrom was a frequent contributor. They created their sock puppet series &quot;Kiki and Bubu&quot; for &quot;Boing Boing TV&quot;.&lt;br&gt;The episodes appear online, as well as on Virgin America flights.

==Censorship==
&quot;Boing Boing&quot; has been described as an &quot;outspoken critic of censorship elsewhere&quot;, and operates a high speed, high quality Tor exit node. For example, the act of &quot;disemvoweling&quot; was popularized by the site—literally stripping out the vowels of any comment a moderator had taken exception to.

===Violet Blue controversy===
Sex blogger Violet Blue has been mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at &quot;Boing Boing&quot;. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, &quot;Tiny Nibbles&quot;, that all posts related to her had been deleted from &quot;Boing Boing&quot;, without explanation. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; featured an interview that cast the silence on the part of &quot;Boing Boing&quot; on the matter as &quot;inexplicable&quot;, causing a controversy as &quot;Boing Boing&quot; &quot;has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness&quot;. A heated debate ensued after a brief statement on the &quot;Boing Boing&quot; site regarding this action stated: &quot;Violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It&#x27;s our blog and so we made an editorial decision, like we do every single day&quot;. In commentary attached to that blog entry, &quot;many commenters surmised that they had something to do with Blue&#x27;s suing to stop a porn star from also using the name Violet Blue&quot;, and many commenters found the removal troubling, but Xeni Jardin said that she hoped she would not have to make the reasons public.

<doc id="984237" wikidata="Q6257124" url="?curid=984237" title="John Scott (died 1485)">
<text>Sir John Scott, [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (c. 1423 – 17 October 1485) of Scot&#x27;s Hall in Smeeth was a Kent landowner, and committed supporter of the House of York. Among other offices, he served as Comptroller of the Household to Edward IV, and lieutenant to the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

==Family==
John Scott was the son of William Scott (d. 1434) and Isabel Finch (died c. 1457), of Netherfield, Sussex. Following his father&#x27;s death, his mother Isabel married Sir Gervase Clifton as his first wife.

He had a younger brother, William Scott (1428(?) – 1491), who married a wife named Margery, by whom he had six sons and two daughters, and was founder of the Essex branch of the Scott family.

He also had a sister, Joan Scott (d. 1507), who married firstly Thomas Yarde of Denton Court, Kent and secondly Sir Henry Grey of Heton. Joan&#x27;s daughter, Anne Yarde, married Thomas Heveningham of Suffolk.

==Career==
Scott was appointed to commissions in Kent from 1450 onwards, and with Sir John Fogge and Robert Horn expended in excess of £333 in the suppression of Jack Cade&#x27;s uprising in that year. By 1456, he was an esquire of Henry VI. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in Kent in 1458, an office that he held until his death, and he was Sheriff of Kent in 1460.

The &#x27;turning point&#x27; in Scott&#x27;s career, according to Fleming, &#x27;came in June 1460, when, with Fogge and Horn, he gave support to the Yorkist earls that proved crucial to their success in Kent&#x27;. Within a year of the accession of Edward IV, Scott was rewarded with annuities, a knighthood, the office of tronage and pesage in the port of London, and appointments as joint Chirographer of the Common Pleas, deputy butler of Sandwich, lieutenant of Dover under Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, &#x27;the Kingmaker&#x27;, and Comptroller of the Household.

In 1462, as a result of the attainders of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and Thomas, 9th Baron Ros of Helmsley (d. 1464), he was granted custody of Oxford&#x27;s lands, as well as the reversion of lands which were the jointure of Baron Ros&#x27;s widow, Margery [sic?], including the castle and manor of Chilham and the manors of Wilderton and Molash. In 1463, he was granted the manors of Old Swinford and Snodsbury in Worcestershire, in the hands of the crown by the attainder of the Earl of Wiltshire, and was among those entrusted with supervision of all &#x27;wardships, marriages, and ecclesiastical temporalities&#x27; which had fallen to the crown.

In 1466 he purchased the marriage of Sir Edward Poynings, son and heir of Sir Robert Poynings (d.1461), and in the following year was granted custody of Sir Robert Poynings&#x27; lands in Kent.

He also served as Chamberlain to Edward, Prince of Wales, and was a Member of Parliament for Kent in 1467.

In September 1467 he assisted in negotiations for the marriage of Edward IV&#x27;s sister, Margaret of York, to Charles the Bold, and accompanied Margaret to her wedding in Burgundy in the following year. In November 1467 he negotiated a commercial treaty with Burgundy at Brussels, and from May 1469 to February 1470 was involved in commercial negotiations with the Hanseatic League in Flanders.

By 1471 he was appointed &quot;Locum tenens Regis&quot; of the Cinque Ports. How long he served or continued to serve in this position is unknown, but we know that William Fitzalan held the position by 1483. By March of that year was Marshal of Calais. In 1473 and 1474 he travelled to Burgundy, Utrecht and Bruges on diplomatic missions.

It seems likely that he went into exile during the readeption, but returned to England to fight at the Battle of Barnet in April 1471, and assist in the suppression of Fauconberg&#x27;s rebellion in May of that year.

In February 1473 he and others were appointed tutors to Edward IV&#x27;s son, the Prince of Wales. After Edward IV&#x27;s death, he was loyal to Richard III, &#x27;at least until the end of 1484&#x27;.

Scott died 17 October 1485, and was buried, by his instructions, in the north wall of the chancel of St. Mary&#x27;s church, Brabourne. He left a will dated 18 October 1485, proved 18 January 1486. His widow had died by 4 July 1487, and was also buried at St Mary&#x27;s, Brabourne. She left a will dated 25 March 1487.

An uncle, also one &#x27;Sir John Scot of Scott&#x27;s Hall&#x27;, born at Brabourne, had been Lieutenant of Dover Castle from 1399 to his death in 1413. He had also served as Member of Parliament for Hythe in Kent from 1384.

==Marriage and issue==

Scott married Agnes Beaufitz (d.1486/7), daughter and co-heiress of William Beaufitz of The Grange, Gillingham, Kent, and likely also a fishmonger of London, by whom he had a son and two daughters:

*Sir William Scott (d. 24 August 1524), who married Sibyl Lewknor.
*Isabel or Elizabeth Scott (d. 15 August 1528), whom Sir John Scott married to his ward, Sir Edward Poynings. There is a memorial brass to her in St Mary&#x27;s church, Brabourne.
*Margaret Scott (d.1514), who married, as his second wife, Sir Edmund Bedingfield (1443–1496).

From the 16th century onwards Thomas Rotherham, Archbishop of York, was also known by the alternate surname &#x27;Scot&#x27;, and it has been speculated that he was a younger son of Sir John Scott and Agnes Beaufitz. However this claim is said to have been disproved.

<text>Wesley Wade Watkins (born December 15, 1938) is an American politician from the state of Oklahoma. Watkins is a retired member of the United States House of Representatives where he had represented for 14 years as a Democrat and then for six years as a Republican.

==Early life and career==
Wesley Wade Watkins was born to Losie Virgil Watkins Sr. and Mary Etta Johnson Watkins. Wes has one older sister, Mary Althea Watkins Yeats and an older brother, Losie Virgil &quot;L.V.&quot; Watkins Jr. Watkins was born in De Queen, Arkansas, but moved to Oklahoma as a boy. He graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1960, receiving a Master&#x27;s degree from that same school in 1961. After a brief stint working for the United States Department of Agriculture, he worked as an administrator at his alma mater from 1963 to 1966. During that time, he was initiated into Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity as an honorary member while serving as their faculty advisor.

==Entry into politics==
Watkins became active in Democratic party politics in the early 1970s, and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in 1974. Two years later, U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert announced his retirement after 30 years representing the 3rd District. Based in the southeastern part of the state, an area known as Little Dixie, the 3rd was heavily Democratic in both local and national elections. Watkins faced a formidable opponent in Albert&#x27;s popular longtime Chief of Staff and Administrative Assistant, Charles Ward. However, Watkins had closer local ties in the district, while Ward had spent decades in Washington. Watkins prevailed in the Democratic primary runoff and he then gained Albert&#x27;s endorsement and won the general election with 82% of the vote. He was re-elected six more times, always by close to 80% of the vote. For most of this time, he served on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, allowing him to bring large amounts of money to his mostly rural and agricultural district. He was also very active in oil and natural gas issues, and took particularly strong interest in economic development issues for his rural district.

==Campaigns for Governor==
Watkins did not seek an eighth term in 1990, instead running for the Democratic nomination for governor to succeed Republican Henry Bellmon. He raised $3 million for his campaign, the most ever raised for a gubernatorial bid in Oklahoma at the time. In the Democratic primary, he ran ahead of House Speaker Steve Lewis, yet lost to eventual winner David Walters, who had been the Democratic Gubernatorial nominee 4 years earlier in 1986.

Watkins was openly disappointed in the lack of support from the state Democratic hierarchy. In 1994, Watkins ran for governor again, this time as an independent. He only won 23% of the vote. However, his independent candidacy siphoned off enough votes from Lieutenant Governor Jack Mildren, the Democratic candidate, to allow Frank Keating, a Reagan administration official, to become only the third Republican governor in Oklahoma history at that point. Watkins tallied over 233,000 votes, far more than Keating&#x27;s 171,000-vote margin over Mildren. He dominated his former congressional district, winning many of the counties there by large margins.

==Return to Congress==
In 1996, Brewster decided to retire from Congress as it became known that Watkins wanted his seat back. The Republican House leadership persuaded Watkins to run as a Republican, seeing a chance to win a seat where they had never made a serious bid since Oklahoma joined the Union in 1907. They promised Watkins a seat on the Ways and Means Committee with full seniority if he ran as a Republican and won. No congressman had ever served on all three of the major financial committees (Appropriations, Budget and Ways and Means) before. Despite Albert endorsing Watkins&#x27; Democratic opponent, State Senator Darryl Roberts, Watkins won a narrow victory, becoming the first Republican to represent Little Dixie since statehood (it had previously been the 4th District from 1907 to 1915, and had been the 3rd since 1915).

Watkins initially planned to retire from office in 1998 after undergoing back surgery, but was persuaded to run again. He was handily re-elected that year, defeating Walt Roberts. He faced no major-party opposition when he ran for his third term in 2000.

Watkins&#x27; voting record in his first period in Congress had been characterized as somewhat moderate. During his second period, however, his voting record was strongly conservative, usually receiving ratings in the high 90s from the American Conservative Union.

==Retirement from Congress==
Oklahoma lost a congressional seat after the 2000 census due to slower than expected population growth. The final map saw Watkins&#x27; district dismantled, with its territory split between three nearby districts. His home in Stillwater (where he had lived since 1990) was drawn into the western Oklahoma-based 3rd district (the former 6th district), represented by fellow Republican Frank Lucas. Most of his old base in Little Dixie was merged into the Muskogee-based 2nd district. The western portion, including Watkins&#x27; former home in Ada, was drawn into the Norman-based 4th district. Faced with the prospect of running in territory that he did not know and that did not know him, Watkins announced he would retire for good. In an indication of how much his politics had changed since leaving the House for the first time, Watkins served as honorary chairman for conservative Senator Jim Inhofe&#x27;s bid for a second full term.

=== Later career ===
After leaving Congress, he was hired as a senior legislative analyst at the Washington, D.C.–based lobbying and public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.

==Legacy==
After retirement, Wes Watkins continued to focus on issues of economic development, global hunger, global trade, and utilizing innovative technologies to address these issues. He founded a non-profit ministry, Matthew 24.40 Foundation, to provide scholarships for students to install hydroponics systems in diverse global locations to address issues of hunger.
*The Wes Watkins Center for International Trade Development at Oklahoma State University was established in 1990 to increase the economic competitiveness of the state of Oklahoma and to assist Oklahoma-based businesses to engage in global trade.

<doc id="984241" wikidata="Q5352263" url="?curid=984241" title="El Toro (dinghy)">
<text>The El Toro is an American pram sailboat that was designed by Charles McGregor as a sail training dinghy and yacht tender, first built in 1939. It is now often sailed as a singlehanded one-design racer.

The boat is a development of McGregor&#x27;s Sabot design, the plans for which were published in &quot;The Rudder&quot; magazine in 1939. The design has been widely adapted and other derivations include the Naples Sabot, US Sabot, Wind&#x27;ard Sabot and the Australian Holdfast Trainer.

==Production==
The design was built by Moore Sailboats and W. D. Schock Corp in the United States, but it is now out of production. More than 11.000 boats were produced.

==Design==
The El Toro is a recreational sailing dinghy, with the early versions build of plywood and later ones of fiberglass, with wood trim. Spars may be made from wood, aluminum or carbon fiber. It has a cat rig, a squared stem, a nearly plumb transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable daggerboard. Ready to sail it displaces , with the hull alone weighing .

The boat has a draft of with the daggerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water or beaching. It can also be transported on a trailer or automobile roof.

The design has a hull speed of .

==Operational history==
The boat is mostly sailed on the American west coast and is supported by an active class club that organizes racing events, the &quot;El Toro International Yacht Racing Association&quot;.

The class has competed in the annual BullShip Race in Sausalito, California, since 1954. The start line is at the Horizons Restaurant dock and the course runs to San Francisco, past Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge, finishing at the end of the breakwater at the Golden Gate Yacht Club and St. Francis Yacht Club. Due to the distance, currents and other challenges for these small boats the race is referred to as &quot;The El Toro TransPac&quot;, a comparison to the Transpacific Yacht Race.

In a 2015 reviewer T. Sitzmann in &quot;Sail 1 Design&quot; wrote of the El Toro, that they &quot;are satisfactory tenders and sprightly racers. Junior sailing programs at yacht clubs and municipal sailing classes have developed many fine young El Toro captains. High quality racing programs have kept the interest of these young sailors. Often sailors &#x27;move up&#x27; to larger yachts and are frequently recognized as champions. Many return to the lively tactical sailing situations provided by El Toro racing.&quot;

<doc id="984243" wikidata="Q2225722" url="?curid=984243" title="Sassafras Mountain">
<text>Sassafras Mountain is the highest point in the state of South Carolina, United States. It is in the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountains. An observation tower opened on top of Sassafras Mountain in 2019.

==Location==
It is located along the South Carolina - North Carolina border in northern Pickens County, South Carolina nearest to the town of Rosman, North Carolina. The summit is an easy 300 foot walk from the parking lot and is, by merit of not having stairs, wheelchair accessible, although the path is fairly steep.

The North Carolina side of the mountain was owned by former Congressman Charles H. Taylor. In June 2010 he sold to The Conservation Fund. The Fund has donated , at the top of the mountain, to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and conveyed a remaining to the North Carolina Forest Service for Headwaters State Forest.

The Pisgah Quadrangle topographical map, revised 1904–1905, shows the long abandoned Sassafras Gap Road to be the preferred route through to Rosman, N.C. and Brevard, N.C. at the end of the 19th century and that the existing Highway 178 was then a secondary road. This abandoned road is a short distance from the summit and is crossed by the hiking trail to Caesars Head from Sassafras summit. Most people crossing this old roadbed in Sassafras Gap don&#x27;t recognize it as a road, but it is easily recognized because of the short section of steps going down into the roadbed, and a similar section of short steps on the opposite side of the roadbed going up and the trail then continuing steeply up toward Caesars Head. A short hike South down the old Sassafras Gap Road will take you to Hickory Head Spring, the headwater of the South Saluda River. Hickory Head Spring is shown as a feature on the Mill&#x27;s Atlas, 1825, Greenville District, South Carolina.
==Geology==
The granite that originally formed Sassafras Mountain has metamorphosed into Henderson Gneiss, which is quartz, muscovite, and feldspar.

<doc id="984245" wikidata="Q282914" url="?curid=984245" title="Trogidae">
<text>Trogidae, sometimes called hide beetles, is a family of beetles with a distinctive warty or bumpy appearance. Found worldwide, the family includes about 300 species contained in four or five genera.

Trogids range in length from 2 to 20 mm. Their shape is oblong to oval, with a generally flat abdomen. Their color ranges from brown to gray or black, and they often encrust their bodies with soil. They resemble scarab beetles with heavy limbs and spurs.

They are scavengers and are among the last species to visit and feed on carrion. They are most often found on the dry remains of dead animals. Both adults and larvae eat feathers and skin. Some species are found in bird and mammal nests. Details of the life histories of many species are poorly known, since many are specialized to particular types of nests. They are often overlooked by predators and collectors due to their behaviors of covering their bodies with soil and becoming motionless when disturbed.

This group may also be considered Troginae, a subfamily of the Scarabaeidae. The common name &quot;skin beetle&quot; is sometimes used in reference to these beetles, but more often refers to species of the Dermestidae.

==Origins==
Hide beetles are found worldwide. More species of Trogidae are found in dry environments instead of moist environments, typically temperate plains areas. Each genus is more diverse in different regions of the world. &quot;Trox&quot; is found in the Holarctic/Ethiopian area, &quot;Omorgus&quot; within the southern continents, and &quot;Polynoncus&quot; is found in South America.

Controversy exists over whether Trogidae is a family of its own or a subfamily of Scarabaeidae. One major reason for the dispute between classifications is the possible evolution of the ommatidium in the eyes. Different environmental pressures and predators may have led to the adaptation of ommatidium structures within this family. For example, the more advanced and numerous the ommatidium, the more present the larger the ability of the insect to escape and elude predators. The Trogidae may have evolved in Australia.

The oldest known fossils are from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) Zaza Formation of Russia and the Shar-Tolgoy and Dzun-Bain Formations of Mongolia, assignable to the extant genus &quot;Trox&quot; as well as the extinct genera &quot;Cretomorgus&quot; and &quot;Paratrox&quot;. Other known fossils include &quot;Kresnikus beynoni&quot; found in mid-Cretaceous aged Burmese amber.

==Morphology==

Trogidae are characterized by their distinct soil-encrusted, warty, or bumpy appearance. They are usually brown, gray, or black in color and are covered with short, dense setae. Their body shape is oblong to oval with a flat abdomen and their length varies from 2 to 20 mm. The antenna of hide beetles are usually short and clubbed. The hardened elytra of Trogidae, which are generally covered with small knobs giving the beetle their rough appearance, meet along the midline of the body and cover the entire abdomen and well-developed wings. Their heads are bent down and covered by the pronotum. They also have heavy limbs and spurs resembling those of scarab beetles. Trogidae larvae are a creamy yellow/white in color, except at their caudal end which darkens as it accumulates feces. Their heads are dark and heavily sclerotized. The abdominal segments of hide beetles have at least one or more transverse rows of setae.

==Diet and habitat==
Predators rarely attack species of Trogidae. They avoid detection and predation due to their soil covering and motionless behavior. Birds prey upon hide beetles that have invaded the bird nests.

Species of Trogidae often feed on decomposing carcasses. Along with carrion, hide beetles are found within the pellet of many animal species, on other decaying dry matter, and around birds’ and mammals’ nests and feathers, as well as aging bones.

==Mating habits and life cycle==
Little is known about the specifics of the Trogid life cycle. Female Trogids of several species produce chirping noises in order to attract males to their burrows for mating. After impregnation of the female by the male, the female lays the eggs and the larvae hatch after an unknown amount of time. During decomposition of a carcass, the beetles leave their nests to feed on the carrion. As the last succession of insects to appear on the carcass, both larvae and adults can be found feeding on the dry remains. At the site of the carcass, an impregnated female digs small, vertical columns underneath the carcass to lay her eggs, allowing the larvae to locate food after hatching. Trogidae usually have three to five instars.

==Forensic importance==
The use of Trogidae in forensic entomology is unknown at this time. Though they typically arrive last in the order of succession, they can be the first in succession on burned and charred bodies. After the burned skin is eaten away by the trogids, the corpse (with now-exposed, &quot;fresher&quot; surfaces) allows for viable colonization by other forensically important insects that help determine accurate &quot;post mortem&quot; interval estimates.

Various species of Trogidae have been used by museums to clean up skeletons by eating any remaining dried material left on the skeletons, leaving them clean for display. This method of bone-stripping has been used by some museums for many years, as it is the most effective method.

==Research==

The Chinese Academy of Sciences funded a study on the classification of this family of beetles. The forensic importance of African Trogidae and other carrion-associated beetles is being studied at the University of Pretoria. This project is investigating how the presence of beetles on carrion affects the infestation of other arthropods in carrion in Africa.

<text>Sir Simon de Burley (ca. 1336 – 5 May 1388) was holder of the offices of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover Castle between 1384–88, and was a Knight of the Garter.

==Life==
Sir Simon Burley was one of the most influential men in the court of King Richard II of England. Although of humble origin, he was brought up with Edward, the Black Prince; they became intimate friends, and Burley was raised to become a tutor to the prince&#x27;s son, later Richard II. 
He first served in the fleet which destroyed the Spanish corsairs in 1350. 
In 1355, he took part in Edward&#x27;s abortive expedition from Calais, and in 1364 he appears in attendance on the Black Prince in Aquitaine. By him he was sent on the embassy to Peter of Castile in 1366, and shared in his restoration and the victory of Najara in 1367. 
On the war being renewed in 1369, he was attacked near Lusignan, when with a detached force, and made prisoner by the French. 
On the release of the Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon he was exchanged (1370) and rejoined the Black Prince at Limoges.

In 1377, Richard II confirmed an annual grant of £100 to Burley granted to him first by Sir John Chandos and then by Edward III along with the custody of Carmarthen castle, in terms referring to him as &quot;the King&#x27;s father&#x27;s Knight&quot;.
In the same year, Burley was given the office of Master of the Falcon and Keeper of the Mews near Charring, and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle for life. 
The following year, the King further granted Burley the manor of Chiltenham in Gloucester and the &#x27;fee simple&#x27; of the castle and lordship of Llanstephan. 

In 1382, Richard granted him the office of under-chamberlain of the King&#x27;s household for life, and appointed him surveyor of the lands in South Wales in the King&#x27;s hands during the minority of the heir of Edmund Mortimer. 
In 1384, the King granted him for life the constableship of Dover Castle and the wardenship of the Cinque Ports, and three hundred pounds yearly (for the maintenance of himself, chaplains, etc.) with provision that he exercise the office himself. 
His long connection with the family of Richard II is indicated by his being named by Joan of Kent, King Richard&#x27;s mother, as one of the executors of her will in 1385.

In 1388 Burley, along with other favourites of the King, was impeached for treason by the commons under the Merciless Parliament. He was executed on 5 May 1388.

=== Role in 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt ===

In some histories, Sir Simon Burley figures as the trigger for the explosion of the English Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381 in the county of Kent. In the story related by the &quot;Anonimalle Chronicle&quot;, Simon Burley appeared in Gravesend with two sergeants on 3 June 1381, and laid claim that one of its residents, a certain Robert Belling (or Bellyng), was his runaway bondsman. When the townsfolk of Gravesend pleaded with Burley on the man&#x27;s behalf, Burley demanded £300 in silver for manumission. It was an enormous sum that Belling could not afford nor his Gravesend supporters raise for his release, so Burley ordered the royal sergeants to arrest Belling and confine him to nearby Rochester Castle until the money was raised. This incident hit a nerve in the region, long tired of corruption and abuses by royal officials, and led directly to a riot in Dartford (just seven miles from Gravesend) the next day. An armed band was raised that would go on to attack Rochester Castle on 6 June and spring Robert Belling out of jail. Wat Tyler would be elected leader of this Kentish rebel band a few days later.

There are a few problems with the &quot;Anonimalle&quot; story. Firstly, Simon Burley was abroad at the time, negotiating the king&#x27;s marriage with Anne of Bohemia, and so could not have appeared at Gravesend in person. Secondly, uniquely among English counties, villein service was not practiced in Kent at the time. Nonetheless, the release of Robert Belling from Rochester is well-attested in other sources. So it is possible that Belling may have run away from Burley&#x27;s estates in another county (e.g. Essex), and that the claim in Gravesend was carried out by another official in Burley&#x27;s name.

==Family==
Simon Burley had no children (that survived). His father was a John Burley of Birley, Hereford, and Simon was the younger brother of another Sir John Burley who, along with his son Richard had also served under the Black Prince and were also both Knights of the Garter.

<text>The Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT, General Union of Workers) is a major Spanish trade union, historically affiliated with the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE).

== History ==
The UGT was founded 12 August 1888 by Pablo Iglesias Posse in Mataró (Barcelona), with Marxist socialism as its ideological basis, despite its statutory apolitical status. Until its nineteenth Congress in 1920, it did not consider class struggle as a basic principle of trade union action. The UGT was closely associated with the PSOE.

During the World War I era, the UGT followed a tactical line of close relationships and unity of action with the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, National Labour Confederation). The UGT grew rapidly after 1917, and by 1920 had 200,000 members. This era came to a sudden end with the advent of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, who gave a legal monopoly on labor organizing to his own government-sponsored union, the Patriotic Union. While the CNT opted for a radical confrontation with the regime and were prohibited on this account, the UGT, although in disagreement with the dictatorship, adopted a collaborative attitude in order to continue to operate legally. The UGT grew from 277,011 in December 1930, to 958,451 in December 1931, to 1,041,539 in June 1932. Much of this growth occurred in its land workers&#x27; federation, the &quot;Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra&quot; (FNTT), which grew from 36,639 in June 1930 to 392,953 in June 1932, raising the proportion of land workers in the UGT from 13 percent to 37 percent. The influx of these workers (&quot;jornaleros&quot;) caused the union&#x27;s radicalisation, and the bloody breakout of the Spanish Civil War deepened the internal fissures that resulted in the departure of Largo Caballero from the position of UGT secretary general in 1937.

General Francisco Franco confined the UGT to exile and clandestinity after his victory in the Spanish Civil War until his death in 1975. The Union emerged from secrecy during the democratic transition after Franco&#x27;s death, as did the communist Workers&#x27; Commissions (Comisiones Obreras, CCOO). The UGT and CCOO, between them, constitute the major avenues for workers&#x27; representation in modern Spain, with the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) a distant third.

== Objectives ==
The UGT declares itself to be an institution of productive workers, organized along lines of trades and liberal professions, which respects freedom of thought, leading toward the transformation of the society, in order to establish it on the basis of social justice, equality and solidarity.

== Federations and foundations ==
===Current affiliates===


The Unión de Trabajadores por Cuenta Propia (UTCP, Union of Self-Employed Workers) is not an organism of UGT. It is a bottom-up association, formed by the farmers&#x27; union UPA and the professional and autonomous workers&#x27; union, UPTA, who united in this manner to enhance their representation inside the Union and to form a united front on factional issues where they have common interests.

<text>Huanglong () is a scenic and historic interest area in the northwest part of Sichuan, China. It is located in the southern part of the Minshan mountain range, north-northwest of the capital Chengdu. This area is known for its colorful travertine pools formed by calcite deposits, especially in Huanglonggou (Yellow Dragon Gully), as well as diverse forest ecosystems, snow-capped peaks, waterfalls and hot springs. Huanglong is also home to many endangered species including the giant panda and the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey. In addition, a large population of the endemic orchid species &#x27;Cypripedium plectrochilum&#x27; was discovered at the site Huanglong was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1992 because of its outstanding travertine formations, waterfalls and limestone formations as well as its travertine terraces and lakes rating among the three most outstanding examples in the world.

==Description==

Repeated glaciation events, the unique terrane structure, the formation of tufa, the stratum of carbonic acid rock, and climatic conditions such as Arctic-alpine sunlight have created this world-famous travertine landscape. Huanglong covers an area of 700 km2 at an altitude between 1700m and 5588m. Major scenic areas include:
* Huanglong Valley ()
* Danyun Gorge (): A canyon more than 1,000 meters in depth. The snow melt from the nearby Mount Xuebaoding travels through this canyon, providing much of the water for the region. 
* Muni Valley ()
* Xuebaoding () – . The highest peak in the Min Mountains
* Xueshan Ridge () – , the highest point on the road from Jiuhuang Airport to Huanglong Valley.
* Red Star Rock ()
* Sigou ()

===Huanglong Valley===
The total length of the travertine in Huanglong Valley is 3.6 km and it is thought to look like a huge golden dragon wheeling through the snow-capped mountains of the valley. The main landscapes are travertine banks, colorful ponds and travertine waterfalls and caves. The main body of water starts from the ancient Buddhist/Benbo temple at the top of the valley and ends at the Guests Welcome Pond in the north with a length of 2.5 km and a width of 30–170m. The colours of Huanglong&#x27;s waters consist of yellows, greens, blues and browns.

<doc id="984281" wikidata="Q1249539" url="?curid=984281" title="A3 (Sydney)">
<text>The A3 is a route designation of a major metropolitan arterial route through suburban Sydney, connecting the A8 at Mona Vale at its northern end, to Princes Highway at Blakehurst at its southern end. This name covers a few consecutive roads and is widely known to most drivers, but the entire allocation is also known – and signposted – by the names of its constituent parts: Mona Vale Road, [[Ryde Road]], [[Lane Cove Road]], Devlin Street, Church Street, Concord Road, Homebush Bay Drive, Centenary Drive, Roberts Road, Wiley Avenue and [[King Georges Road]].

It is a major connector between most of the major radial routes emanating from central Sydney, and a major link between the northern and southern parts of the Sydney tolled orbital freeway. It is the most direct, although not necessarily the quickest, route across Sydney between the South Coast and the North Coast. It is one of only three road connections between the Northern Beaches region of Sydney and the rest of Sydney (the other two being routes A38 and A8.

==Route==

The A3 commences at the intersection of Pittwater Road at Mona Vale and heads in a southwesterly direction as Mona Vale Road as a two-lane, single carriageway road, widening to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road at Terrey Hills and to a six-lane, dual-carriageway road at St Ives, before running under Pacific Highway at an interchange at Pymble. It changes name to Ryde Road and continues in a southwesterly direction, crossing the Lane Cove River over De Burghs Bridge and changing names to Lane Cove Road, before crossing M2 Hills Motorway at Macquarie Park and then Epping Road in North Ryde shortly afterwards. It changes name again to Devlin Street at the intersection with Blaxland Road at Ryde, and then runs under Victoria Road at an interchange shortly after, before changing name again to Church Street, crossing Parramatta River over Ryde Bridge, and changing name to Concord Road. 

Just south of Rhodes, it changes name to Homebush Bay Drive and heads in a southerly direction, crossing M4 Motorway and changing name again to Centenary Drive, then over Great Western Highway in a short distance just south of Sydney Olympic Park. Marlborough Road, which serves as an on-off ramp on both sides of the main roadway in the vicinity of the Flemington Markets, and the associated loop road, is part of the route designation. 

It crosses over Hume Highway at Strathfield South, where it changes name to Roberts Road, and continues south to Greenacre, where it diverts southeast and changes name again to Wiley Avenue, before meeting Punchbowl Road at Lakemba, where it changes name for the last time to King Georges Road and continues in a southeasterly direction. After crossing M5 Motorway at Beverly Hills, the road narrows to a four-lane, single-carriageway road before eventually terminating at an intersection with Princes Highway at Blakehurst.

Much of the route becomes very congested in peak hour. The highest speed limit on the A3 is on Mona Vale Road.

==History==

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board. Main Road No. 139 was declared along Devlin Street between Gladesville Road (today Blaxland Road) in Ryde (and continuing northwards via Eastwood and Epping to the intersection with Pennant Hills Road in Pennant Hills), Main Road No. 162 was declared along Wicks, Pittwater and Lane Cove Roads through Ryde, Ryde Road through Gordon, then via St. Ives to the intersection with Pittwater Road in Mona Vale, and Main Road No. 200 was declared from the intersection of Great Western Highway and Concord Road in Concord, along Concord Road to Parramatta River (using the punt service between Rhodes and Meadowbanks) then along Bowden Street to Parramatta Road (today Victoria Road), on the same day, 8 August 1928, and Main Road 315 was declared on 19 February 1929, from the intersection with Great Western Highway south along Concord Road through Strathfield, The Boulevard, Punchbowl Road, Wiley Avenue, Canary Road and Belmore Road to Hurstville (and continuing south along Woniora Road to meet Princes Highway at Blakehurst); with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these was amended to Main Roads 139 and 162 and 200 and 315 on 8 April 1929.

The punt service across Parramatta River was replaced by Ryde Bridge in 1935, changing the alignment to today&#x27;s route along Church Street to meet Devlin Street in Ryde on 19 March 1935.

Main Road 162 was officially named Mona Vale Road, between Pittwater Road in Mona Vale and Pacific Highway Pymble, on 10 January 1951, and Ryde Road, between Pacific Highway and De Burghs Bridge in West Pymble (previously known as The Broadway), on 27 February 1952. Main Road 315 was officially named King Georges Road, between Punchbowl Road in Lakemba and Princes Highway in Blakehurst (previously known as Wiley Avenue, Canary Road, Dumbleton Road and Belmore Road), on 24 September 1952, and Main Road 200 was officially named Church Street, between Devlin Street in Ryde and Ryde Bridge, on 6 May 1953. Ryde Council later constructed a new alignment through Ryde, changing from Wicks and Pittwater Roads to today&#x27;s Lane Cove Road in September 1961. The southern end of Main Road 315 between Hurstville and Blakeville was re-aligned to follow the entire length of King Georges Road (and terminate at Princes Highway some distance south than its previous intersection at Woniora Road) on 11 November 1964.

What is now called A3 was initially designated to become a major north–south metropolitan arterial route in 1964, when the route incorporating the existing local arterial roads above was designated Ring Road 3. After 1964, upgrading projects were commenced, with the construction of new De Burghs Bridges over the Lane Cove River between Pymble and Ryde (1967). A grade-separated crossing was constructed at Epping Road at North Ryde (1978).

Prior to 1983, the route passed through the Strathfield town centre, proceeding along (north to south) Concord Road, The Boulevarde, Coronation Parade and Punchbowl Road, to join King Georges Road. The part of this route that passes through Strathfield town centre was very congested and also problematical to widen. A major deviation of this part of the route was built between 1983 and 1998, relocating the arterial route to the west between Rhodes and Wiley Park, to bypass the Strathfield bottleneck and improve access to the Olympic Precinct at Homebush Bay. Called the &quot;Strathfield Bypass&quot; at the time, the deviation route includes the new Homebush Bay Drive and Centenary Drive (named for the centenary of Strathfield Municipality), and an upgraded Roberts Road though Chullora and Greenacre, connecting to King Georges Road near Wiley Park. The road upgrades, new bridges and connections for this deviation were completed in stages between 1983 and 1998. At this time, the southern end of Main Road 200 was altered, from its earlier alignment along Concord Road between Ryde Bridge and Strathfield, to Homebush Bay Drive, Centenary Drive, Roberts Road, Wiley Avenue and King Georges Road to terminate with Princes Highway at Blakeville, subsuming the southern half of Main Road 315 (its northern half, along Punchbowl Road, was made part of Main Road 549, and from Stathfield along The Boulevard, was replaced by Main Road 668, which was also routed north along the former alignment of Main Road 200, from Strathfield along Concord Road to meet Homebush Bay Drive just south of Ryde Bridge), on 22 January 1993.

Also during this period, Ryde Bridge over the Parramatta River between Ryde and Rhodes was duplicated (1988), grade-separate crossings were constructed at the Pacific Highway at Pymble (grade separation completed in 1989). As a major access route to Sydney Olympic Park, a grade-separated crossing was constructed at the M4 Motorway and Parramatta Road, at Flemington (1992) and the intersection with Australia Avenue and Underwood Road at Homebush (1998). Grade-separated crossings were also constructed at M2 Hills Motorway at Macquarie Park (1997), at Victoria Road at Top Ryde (1998), the Hume Highway at Chullora (1998), and the M5 Motorway at Beverly Hills (2001).

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the A3 retains its declaration as Main Roads 139 (as Devlin Street), 162 (as Lane Cove, Ryde and Mona Vale Roads), and Main Road 200 (Church Street, Homebush Bay and Centenary Drives, Roberts Road, Wiley Avenue and King Georges Road).

The route was allocated Ring Road 3 in 1964, before it was replaced with State Route 33 in 1974. When the new alignment around Strathfield (along Homebush Bay and Centenary Drives and Roberts Road) opened, State Route 33 was rerouted along it, with the original alignment through Strathfield (along The Boulevarde and Punchbowl Road, along Main Roads 549 and 668) was subsequently allocated State Route 27 in December 1992, later decommissioned in 2004. The whole route was re-designated Metroad 3 in April 1993, one of Sydney&#x27;s only Metroad routes not to have changed alignment since their introduction. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, Metroad 3 was replaced by route A3.

<doc id="984284" wikidata="Q6797360" url="?curid=984284" title="Maymont">
<text>Maymont is a 100-acre (0.156 sq mi) Victorian estate and public park in Richmond, Virginia. It contains Maymont Mansion, now a historic house museum, an arboretum, an Italian and Japanese garden, a carriage collection, native wildlife exhibits, a nature center, and a petting zoo.

In 1893, James H. Dooley, a wealthy Richmond lawyer and philanthropist, and his wife, Sallie, completed their elaborate Gilded Age estate on a site high above the James River. According to their wishes, after their deaths Maymont was left to the people of Richmond. Over the next 75 years, additional attractions were added.

==History==
Maymont was named for James Dooley&#x27;s wife, Sallie May. Construction of the mansion completed in 1893. The Dooleys also built a summer home on Afton Mountain, Swannanoa, which was completed in 1913. In 2011, Maymont was named one of the top 10 public spaces by the American Planning Association.

==Gardens==

The Japanese Garden at Maymont is well tended and features a koi pond and a large waterfall. The Japanese Garden also has a torii arch, rock gardens, and various red maples. It is a blend of two different time periods and a mixture of many styles of gardens. In 1911, a section of the Kanawha Canal was bought to be a part of the garden.

Years following Mrs. Dooley&#x27;s passing, the Japanese garden increasingly lost its magnificence and design. The garden still has its stonework and winding watercourse that leads to its large pond. After realizing the decline of the quality of the garden, Earth Design renovated it in 1978. The new design of the Japanese is considered a &quot;stroll garden&quot; which offers guests at Maymont to see how the changing impact of nature has on the grounds.

Created by Noland and Baskervill of Richmond (now Baskervill), The Italian Garden features a pergola, fountains, urns and roses. The creators of the garden modeled their design after the 15th and 16th century Italian classical style. The garden is laid out on many levels, facing the south which once overlooked the James River. The design of the Cascade and the Fountain Court is patterned like the Villa Torlonia near Rome. The Italian Garden was completed in 1910, when the Petersburg granite stonework was laid down.

The arboretum contains more than 200 species of trees and woody plants. It includes a number of &quot;exotic champions&quot; including a &quot;Cedrus atlantica&quot;, &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;, &quot;Parrotia persica&quot;, and &quot;Tilia europea&quot;. Some examples of exotic flora that are on grounds include False Larch and Pseudolarix kaempferia from Japan; White Enkianthus and the Enkianthis perulatas from China; and Persian Ironwood. This is credited to the same landscaper who helped with the design of the Italian garden, Henry E. Baskervill. Credit goes to the Dooleys as well, who had the final say on the estates design.

Maymont&#x27;s gardens are popular for outdoor weddings focused around the Italian Garden, the Japanese Garden and numerous gazebos located throughout the grounds. There are ten specialty gardens as well. There is the &quot;Marie&#x27;s Butterfly Garden&quot; that was finished in 2009. It starts east of the Children&#x27;s Farm and goes along the horse and cow pastures, down to the Bobcat habitat. Examples of flowers include yarrow, butterfly weed, cone flowers, butterfly bushes, sunflowers, blue spirea and herbs. There is also an Herb Garden on grounds which was donated by the Richmond Council of Garden Clubs in 1957. It has been maintained by the Old Dominion Herb Society since 1978.

==Fauna==
In addition to the farm animals that it keeps in the Children&#x27;s Farm, Maymont is the permanent home of several animals that are native to the Commonwealth. Many of these have been injured and are otherwise unable to live in the wild. These animals include a bald eagle, a bobcat, two black bears, and a fox. Visitors are also able to see elk and American bison. A nature center is also on the grounds, which exhibits many aquatic animals found in and around Virginia such as otters, alligators, and sharks. Throughout the park, Canada geese, American snapping turtles, numerous species of snakes, and American bullfrogs can be found wild.

<doc id="984285" wikidata="Q7359199" url="?curid=984285" title="Roger de Leybourne">
<text>Sir Roger de Leybourne (1215–1271) was an English soldier, landowner and royal servant during the Second Barons&#x27; War.

== Origins ==
Roger was the younger son of another Sir Roger de Leybourne, by his first wife, Eleanor, the daughter and heiress of Stephen of Thornham. In 1199, when the elder Roger was still a minor, his wardship was sold to Thornham for 300 marks. The elder Roger then joined the rebels at the start of the First Barons&#x27; War in 1215, being captured in November at the siege of Rochester Castle, paying 250 marks for his release. After the death of the elder Roger some time before 1251 his son William de Leybourne inherited seven Knight&#x27;s fees in Kent and Oxfordshire, as well as substantial debts, which were only cancelled in 1253 by Henry III.

== Life ==
Roger first came to royal notice in 1252 when he killed Arnulf de Munteny, one of the king&#x27;s household knights, in a jousting tournament with a sharpened lance, avenging himself of an injury caused by Arnulf in a previous tournament. To atone for his crime he &quot;took the cross&quot; (went on a Pilgrimage), and was pardoned by King Henry III.

In 1253 he was given the lands of Roger Connell in Kent, and from then until his death he spent large amounts of time and money acquiring land in that county. In 1257 he served in the army of Lord Edward as part of his campaign in Wales, and became part of an influential group of his supporters. He joined Edward in autumn 1259 when he allied with Simon de Montfort, and was made custodian of Bristol Castle in November. He was part of Edward&#x27;s retinue in 1260 when he and the Earl of Gloucester attempted to take London, and was one of those pardoned when Edward patched up his relationship with Henry III. In thanks for this service Edward gave him the manor of Elham in Kent, but in 1262 the grant was deemed to be in violation of the conditions of Henry giving the manor to Edward in the first place, and the manor was returned, with the High Sheriff of Kent being ordered to take £1,820 from Leybourne&#x27;s lands; Leybourne frustrated him by simply removing all the goods from his lands in Kent, Essex and Sussex.

In 1263 he along with other Marcher Lords arrested Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford, and seized Hereford, Gloucester, and Bristol, returning south to assault Windsor Castle. They were joined by Simon de Montfort, beginning the Second Barons&#x27; War. They marched into Kent, attacking the Cinque Ports. By August 1263 the Marcher Lords were in negotiations with Edward, having been unnerved by de Montford&#x27;s plan to ally with the Welsh, and they swore an oath to the king on the 18th. From this point onwards Leybourne was a loyal servant of the king, and swiftly returned to royal favour. In September he was made Steward of the King&#x27;s Household, Keeper of Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and in December was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and made High Sheriff of Kent. In October 1263 he was one of those who sealed the agreement between Henry and Louis IX, and travelled with the king to France at the end of the year.

During the second half of the conflict with de Montfort, Leybourne fought at the Battle of Northampton and as a defender at the siege of Rochester Castle, where he was badly wounded. He fought at the Battle of Lewes with the other marcher lords, who were allowed to go free after their defeat on the condition that they return to stand trial at the next Parliament. When they failed to do so, de Montfort sent a military expedition which failed to defeat them. So they remained a thorn in the side of de Montfort throughout the rest of the war.

In December 1264 he was given a safe conduct to visit the king, and then in May 1265 he spoke with Edward, helping organise his escape from Kenilworth Castle on 28 May. Leybourne subsequently fought at the Battle of Evesham, reportedly saving the king&#x27;s life, and for the two years of conflict after Evesham served as Edward&#x27;s principal lieutenant. In August 1265 he was made keeper of Westmorland, in October he was given custody of Carlisle Castle, made High Sheriff of Cumberland and trusted with subduing London on behalf of the king. In November he fought the rebels in Kent, and in January 1266 he recaptured Sandwich, serving as Edward&#x27;s deputy for the capture of the other Cinque Ports. Along with Edward he besieged and captured Winchelsea, fighting off rebels across the Thames in May. He was knighted in September, with the king ordering that he should be received everywhere &#x27;with due honour as the king&#x27;s knight&#x27;. He was also a member of the king&#x27;s council, and appointed custodian of Nottingham Castle.

During this period he was rewarded by the king with large amounts of land, including the village of Leeds, Kent, where he later built a castle, and areas of Kent, Cumberland and Westmorland. He went on a second pilgrimage in 1269, and was rewarded with 1000 marks from Ottobuono, the papal legate, who later became Pope Adrian V. Rather than going to the Holy Land he travelled to Gascony, where he had been appointed Lieutenant on 29 November 1269, with his aim possibly being to raise men for the crusade. He stayed for long enough to have the city of Libourne named after him, but returned home in December 1270, dying before 7 November 1271.

<doc id="984287" wikidata="Q937243" url="?curid=984287" title="Domain controller (Windows)">
<text>On Microsoft Servers, a domain controller (DC) is a server computer that responds to security authentication requests (logging in, etc.) within a Windows domain. A &quot;domain&quot; is a concept introduced in Windows NT whereby a user may be granted access to a number of computer resources with the use of a single username and password combination.

== History ==
One domain controller per domain was configured as the primary domain controller (PDC), all other domain controllers were backup domain controllers (BDC).
Because of the critical nature of the PDC, best practices dictated that the PDC should be dedicated solely to domain services, and not used for file, print or application services that could slow down or crash the system. Some network administrators took the additional step of having a dedicated BDC online for the express purpose of being available for promotion if the PDC failed.

A BDC could authenticate the users in a domain, but all updates to the domain could only be made via the PDC, which would then propagate these changes to all BDCs in the domain. If the PDC was unavailable the update would fail. If the PDC was permanently unavailable an existing BDC could be promoted to be and later versions introduced Active Directory (&quot;AD&quot;), which largely eliminated the concept of PDC and BDC in favor of multi-master replication. However, there are still several roles that only one domain controller can perform, called the Flexible single master operation roles. Some of these roles must be filled by one DC per domain, while others only require one DC per AD Forest. If the server performing one of these roles is lost, the domain can still function, and if the server will not be available again, an administrator can designate an alternate DC to assume the role in a process known as &quot;seizing&quot; the role.

==Primary domain controller==
In Windows NT 4, one DC serves as the primary domain controller (PDC). Others, if they exist, are usually a backup domain controller (BDC). The PDC is typically designated as the &quot;first&quot;. The &quot;User Manager for Domains&quot; is a utility for maintaining user/group information. It uses the domain security database on the primary controller. The PDC has the master copy of the user accounts database which it can access and modify. The BDC computers have a copy of this database, but these copies are read-only. The PDC will replicate its account database to the BDCs on a regular basis. The BDCs exist in order to provide a backup to the PDC, and can also be used to authenticate users logging on to the network. If a PDC should fail, one of the BDCs can then be promoted to take its place. The PDC will usually be the first domain controller that was created unless it was replaced by a promoted BDC.

===PDC emulation (Primary Domain Controller)===
In modern releases of Windows, domains have been supplemented by the use of Active Directory services. In Active Directory domains, the concept of primary and secondary domain controller relationships no longer applies. PDC emulators hold the accounts databases and administrative tools. As a result, a heavy workload can slow the system down. The DNS service may be installed on a secondary emulator machine to relieve the workload on the PDC emulator. The same rules apply; only one PDC may exist on a domain, but multiple replication servers may still be used.

* The PDC emulator master acts in place of the PDC if there are Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers (BDCs) remaining within the domain, acting as a source for them to replicate from.
* The PDC emulator master receives preferential replication of password changes within the domain. As password changes take time to replicate across all the domain controllers in an Active Directory domain, the PDC emulator master receives notification of password changes immediately, and if a logon attempt fails at another domain controller, that domain controller will forward the logon request to the PDC emulator master before rejecting it.
* The PDC emulator master also serves as the machine to which all domain controllers in the domain will synchronise their clocks. It, in turn, should be configured to synchronise to an external NTP time source.

===Samba===
Primary Domain Controllers (PDC) have been faithfully recreated on the Samba emulation of Microsoft&#x27;s SMB client/server system. Samba has the capability to emulate an NT 4.0 domain, as well as modern Active Directory Domain Services on a Linux machine.

==Backup domain controller==
In Windows NT 4 domains, the backup domain controller (BDC) is a computer that has a copy of the user accounts database. Unlike the accounts database on the PDC, the BDC database is a read-only copy. When changes are made to the master accounts database on the PDC, the PDC pushes the updates down to the BDCs. These additional domain controllers exist to provide fault tolerance. If the PDC fails, then it can be replaced by a BDC. In such circumstances, an administrator promotes a BDC to be the new PDC. BDCs can also authenticate user logon requests and take some of the authentication load from the PDC.

When Windows 2000 was released, the NT domain as found in NT 4 and prior versions was replaced by Active Directory. In Active Directory domains running in native mode, the concept of the PDC and BDC do not exist. In these domains, all domain controllers are considered equals. A side effect of this change is the loss of ability to create a &quot;read-only&quot; domain controller. Windows Server 2008 reintroduced this capability.

==Nomenclature==
Windows Server can be one of three kinds: Active Directory &quot;domain controllers&quot; (ones that provide identity and authentication), Active Directory &quot;member servers&quot; (ones that provide complementary services such as file repositories and schema) and Windows Workgroup &quot;stand-alone servers&quot;. The term &quot;Active Directory Server&quot; is sometimes used by Microsoft as synonymous to &quot;Domain Controller&quot; but the term is discouraged.

<doc id="984289" wikidata="Q4111" url="?curid=984289" title="Jiuzhaigou">
<text>Jiuzhaigou (; ) is a nature reserve and national park located in the north of Sichuan Province in southwestern China. A long valley running north to south, Jiuzhaigou was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1992 and a World Biosphere Reserve in 1997. It belongs to the category V (Protected Landscape) in the IUCN system of protected area categorization.

The Jiuzhaigou valley is part of the Min Mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and stretches over . It has an altitude of over 4800 meters and is composed of a series of diverse forest ecosystems. It is known for its many multi-level waterfalls, colorful lakes, and snow-capped peaks. Its elevation ranges from . The Jiuzhaigou area borders the Minshan Garna Peak in the south, and the Huanglong Scenic Area is to Jiuzhaigou&#x27;s north. It originates from the Baishui River area, one of the headwaters of the Jialing River and a part of the Yangtze River system.

==History==

Jiuzhaigou (literally &quot;Nine Settlement Valley&quot;) takes its name from the nine Tibetan settlements along its length.

The remote region was inhabited by various Tibetan and Qiang peoples for centuries. Until 1975 this inaccessible area was little known. Extensive logging took place until 1979, when the Chinese government banned such activity and made the area a national park in 1982. An Administration Bureau was established and the site officially opened to tourism in 1984; layout of facilities and regulations were completed in 1987.

The site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1992 and a World Biosphere Reserve in 1997. The tourism area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.

Since opening, tourist activity has increased every year: from 5,000 in 1984 to 170,000 in 1991, 160,000 in 1995, to 200,000 in 1997, including about 3,000 foreigners. Visitors numbered 1,190,000 in 2002. , the site averages 7,000 visits per day, with a quota of 12,000 being reportedly enforced during high season. The Town of Zhangzha at the exit of the valley and the nearby Songpan County feature an ever-increasing number of hotels, including several luxury five-stars, such as Sheraton.

Developments related to mass tourism in the region have caused concerns about the impact on the environment around the park.

=== 2017 earthquake ===
In August 2017, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Jiuzhaigou County, causing significant structural damage. The authorities closed the valley to tourists until March 3, 2018, before reopening the park with limited access.

The Jiuzhaigou earthquake in Sichuan, China had a significant impact on the scenic area. The earthquake also resulted in the damage and breakage of two natural dams, namely the Nuorilang Waterfall dam and the Huohua Lake dam.

The Nuorilang Waterfall suffered damage due to its initial low stability and topographic effects. The dam was composed of poor material with low mechanical strength, making it prone to rockfalls even during non-earthquake periods. The nearly vertical structure of the dam amplified the seismic influences at its upper part, increasing the likelihood of deformation and collapse.

The Jiuzhaigou earthquake caused the Huohua Lake dam to break. After the dam broke, the water discharge increased from the normal level of 9.3 m3/s to a maximum of 21.5 m3/s. As a result, the water level rapidly descended, leading to collapses along the dam.

==Population==
Seven of the nine Tibetan villages are still populated today. The main agglomerations that are readily accessible to tourists are Heye, Shuzheng and Zechawa along the main paths that cater to tourists, selling various handicrafts, souvenirs and snacks. There is also Rexi in the smaller Zaru Valley and behind Heye village are Jianpan, Panya and Yana villages. Guodu and Hejiao villages are no longer populated. Penbu, Panxing and Yongzhu villages lie along the road that passes through the town of Jiuzhaigou/Zhangza outside the valley.

In 2003, the permanent population of the valley was about 1,000 comprising 112 families, and due to the protected nature of the park, agriculture is no longer permitted so the locals now rely on tourism and local government subsidies to make a living.

==Geography and climate==

Jiuzhaigou lies at the southern end of the Minshan mountain range, north of the provincial capital of Chengdu. It is part of the Jiuzhaigou County (formerly Nanping County) in the Aba Tibetan Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of northwestern Sichuan province, near the Gansu border.

The valley covers , with buffer zones covering an additional . Its elevation, depending on the area considered, ranges from 1,998 to 2,140 m (at the mouth of Shuzheng Gully) to 4,558-4,764 m (on Mount Ganzigonggai at the top of Zechawa Gully).

The climate is subtropical to temperate monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 7.8 °C, with means of −3.7 °C in January and 16.8 °C in July. Total annual rainfall is 761 mm but in the cloud forest it is at least 1,000 mm. 80% of rainfall occurs between May and October.Due to the monsoon moving towards the valley, summer is mild, cloudy, and moderately humid. Above an altitude of 3500 meters, the climate is colder and drier.

==Ecology==
Jiuzhaigou&#x27;s ecosystem is classified as temperate broad-leaf forest and woodlands, with mixed mountain and highland systems. Nearly of the core scenic area are covered by virgin mixed forests. Those forests take on attractive (vibrant) yellow, orange and red hues in the autumn, making that season a popular one for visitors. They are home to a number of plant species of interest, such as endemic varieties of rhododendron and bamboo.

Local fauna includes the endangered giant panda and golden snub-nosed monkey. Both populations are very small (fewer than 20 individuals for the pandas) and isolated. Their survival is in question in a valley subject to increasing tourism. It is one of only three known locations for the threatened Duke of Bedford&#x27;s vole. Jiuzhaigou is also home to approximately 140 bird species.

The region is indeed a natural museum for mountain karst hydrology and research. It preserves a series of important forest ecosystems, including ancient forests that provide important habitats for many endangered animal and plant species such as giant pandas and antelopes. Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area also contains a large number of well preserved Quaternary glacial relics, which are of great scenic value.

==Geology and hydrology==

Jiuzhaigou&#x27;s landscape is made up of high-altitude karsts shaped by glacial, hydrological and tectonic activity. It lies on major faults on the diverging belt between the Qinghai-Tibet Plate and the Yangtze Plate, and earthquakes have also shaped the landscape. The rock strata are mostly made up of carbonate rocks such dolomite and tufa, as well as some sandstone and shales.

The region contains a large amount of tuff, which is a type of limestone formed by the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate in freshwater. It falls on rocks, lake beds, and even fallen trees in the water, sometimes accumulating into terraces, shoals, and dam barriers in the lake.

The valley includes the catchment area of three gullies (which due to their large size are often called valleys themselves), and is one of the sources of the Jialing River via the Bailong River, part of the Yangtze River system.

Jiuzhaigou&#x27;s best-known feature is its dozens of blue, green and turquoise-colored lakes. The local Tibetan people call them &quot;Haizi&quot; in Chinese, meaning &quot;son of the sea&quot;. Originating in glacial activity, they were dammed by rockfalls and other natural phenomena, then solidified by processes of carbonate deposition. Some lakes have a high concentration of calcium carbonate, and their water is very clear so that the bottom is often visible even at high depths. The lakes vary in color and aspect according to their depths, residues, and surroundings.
Some of the less stable dams and formations have been artificially reinforced, and direct contact with the lakes or other features is forbidden to tourists.

==Notable features==
Jiuzhaigou is composed of three valleys arranged in a Y shape. The Rize and Zechawa valleys flow from the south and meet at the centre of the site where they form the Shuzheng valley, flowing north to the mouth of the valley. The mountainous watersheds of these gullies are lined with of roads for shuttle buses, as well as wooden boardwalks and small pavilions. The boardwalks are typically located on the opposite side of the lakes from the road, shielding them from disturbance by passing buses.

Most visitors will first take the shuttle bus to the end of Rize and/or Shuzheng gully, then make their way back downhill by foot on the boardwalks, taking the bus instead when the next site is too distant. Here is a summary of the sites found in each of the gullies:

===Rize Valley===

The Rize Valley (日则沟, pinyin: Rìzé Gōu) is the south-western branch of Jiuzhaigou. It contains the largest variety of sites and is typically visited first. Going downhill from its highest point, one passes the following sites:
* The &quot;Primeval Forest&quot; (原始森林 Yuánshǐ Sēnlín) is a preserved ancient woodland. It is fronted by views of the surrounding mountains and cliffs, including the 500-metre-high, blade-shaped Sword Rock (剑岩 Jiàn Yán).
* &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (天鹅海, Tiān&#x27;é Hǎi) is a 2250-metre-long, 125-metre-wide lake named for its visiting swans and ducks.
* &quot;Grass Lake&quot; (草海, Cǎo Hǎi) is a shallow lake covered in intricate vegetation patterns.
* &quot;Arrow Bamboo Lake&quot; (箭竹海, Jiànzhú Hǎi), covering an area of 170,000 m2, is a shallow lake with a depth of 6 m. It lies at an elevation of 2,618 m, and was a main feature site for the 2002 Chinese film &quot;Hero&quot;.
* &quot;Panda Lake&quot; (熊猫海, Xióngmāo Hǎi) features curious color patterns of blue and green. Giant Pandas were said to have come to this lake to drink, though there have been no sightings for many years. The lake empties into the multi-stream, multi-level Panda Waterfalls, dropping 78 m in three steps.
* &quot;Five Flower Lake&quot; (五花海, Wǔhuā Hǎi) is a shallow multi-colored lake whose bottom is criss-crossed by ancient fallen tree trunks.
* &quot;Pearl Shoal&quot; (珍珠滩, Zhēnzhū Tān) is a wide, gently sloping area of active calcareous tufa deposition covered in a thin sheet of flowing water. It empties into the famous Pearl Waterfalls, where the shoal drops 28 m in a 310-metre-wide broad curtain of water. A scene of the television adaptation of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was filmed there.
* &quot;Mirror Lake&quot; (镜海, Jìng Hǎi) is another quiet lake casting beautiful reflections of the surroundings when the water is calm.

===Zechawa Valley===

The Zechawa Gully (则查洼沟, Zécháwā Gōu) is the south-eastern branch of Jiuzhaigou. It is approximately the same length as Rize gully (18 km) but climbs to a higher altitude (3150 m at the Long Lake). Going downhill from its highest point, it features the following sites:
* &quot;Long Lake&quot; (长海, Cháng Hǎi) is crescent-shaped and is the highest, largest and deepest lake in Jiuzhaigou, measuring in length and up to 103 m in depth. It reportedly has no outgoing waterways, getting its water from snowmelt and losing it from seepage. Local folklore features a monster in its depths.
* &quot;Five-Color Pond&quot; (五彩池, Wǔcǎi Chí) is one of the smallest bodies of water in Jiuzhaigou lakes. Despite its very modest dimensions and depth, it has a richly colored underwater landscape with some of the brightest and clearest waters in the area. According to legend, the pond was where Goddess Semo washed her hair and God Dage came daily to bring her water.
* The &quot;Seasonal Lakes&quot; (季节海, Jìjié Hǎi) are a series of 3 lakes (Lower, Middle and Upper) along the main road, that change from empty to full during each year.

===Shuzheng Valley===

The Shuzheng Valley (树正沟, Shùzhèng Gōu) is the northern (main) branch of Jiuzhaigou. It ends after at the Y-shaped intersection of the three gullies. Going downhill from the intersection to the mouth of the valley, visitors encounter the following:
* &quot;Nuorilang Falls&quot; (诺日朗瀑布, Nuòrìlǎng Pùbù), near the junction of the valleys, are 20 m high and 320 m wide. They are reportedly the widest highland waterfall in China, the widest travertine-topped waterfall in the world, and one of the symbols of Jiuzhaigou.
* &quot;Nuorilang Lakes&quot; (诺日朗群海, Nuòrìlǎng Qúnhǎi) and &quot;Shuzheng Lakes&quot; (树正群海 Shùzhèng Qúnhǎi) are stepped series of respectively 18 and 19 ribbon lakes formed by the passage of glaciers, then naturally dammed. Some of them have their own folkloric names, such as the Rhinoceros, Unknown, and Tiger lakes.
* &quot;Sleeping Dragon Lake&quot; (卧龙海, Wòlóng Hǎi) is one of the lower lakes in the area. With a depth of 20 m, it is notable for the clearly visible calcareous dyke running through it, whose shape has been compared to a dragon lying on the bottom.
* &quot;Reed Lake&quot; (芦苇海, Lúwěi Hǎi) is a 1375-metre-long, reed-covered marsh with a clear turquoise brook (known as the &quot;Jade Ribbon&quot;) zigzagging through it. The contrast is particularly striking in the autumn when the reeds turn golden yellow.

===Others===

* The &quot;Fairy Pool&quot; (神仙池, Shénxiān Chí) lies west of Jiuzhaigou and features travertine pools very similar to those of the nearby Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area.

==Tourism==

The &quot;Zharu Valley&quot; (扎如沟, Zhārú Gōu) runs southeast from the main Shuzheng gully and is rarely visited by tourists. The valley begins at the Zharu Buddhist monastery and ends at the Red, Black, and Daling lakes.

Zharu Valley is the home of tourism in Jiuzhaigou. The valley has recently been opened to a small number of tourists wishing to go hiking and camping off the beaten track. Visitors can choose from day walks and multiple day hikes, depending on their time availability. Knowledgeable guides accompany tourists through the valley, sharing their knowledge about the unique biodiversity and local culture of the national park. The Zharu Valley has 40% of all the plant species that exist in China and it is the best place to spot wildlife inside the national park.

The main hike follows the pilgrimage of the local Benbo Buddhists circumnavigating the sacred 4,528 m Zha Yi Zha Ga Mountain.

==Access==
Jiuzhaigou, compared with other high-traffic scenic spots in China, can be difficult to reach by land. The majority of tourists reach the valley by a ten-hour bus ride from Chengdu along the Min River canyon, which is prone to occasional minor rock-slides and, in the rainy season, mudslides that can add several hours to the trip. The new highway constructed along this route was badly damaged during the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, but has since been repaired and the road is open to public buses and private vehicles.

Since 2003, it has been possible to fly from Chengdu or Chongqing to Jiuzhai Huanglong Airport on a mountain side in Songpan County, and then take an hour-long bus ride to Huanglong, or a 90-minute bus ride to Jiuzhaigou. Since 2006, a daily flight to Xi&#x27;an opens in the peak season. In October 2009, new direct flights were added from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. 

Jiuzhaigou is served by the Huanglongjiuzhai railway station, opened on 30 August 2024. The station forms part of the Sichuan—Qinghai Railway.

== Protection ==
As a national park and national nature reserve, Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area is protected by national and provincial laws and regulations, ensuring the long-term management and protection of the heritage. In 2004, the Sichuan Provincial Regulations on the Protection of World Heritage and the Implementation of the Sichuan Provincial Regulations on the Protection of World Heritage in Aba Autonomous Prefecture became laws, providing a stricter basis for the protection of heritage.

The Sichuan Provincial Construction Commission is fully responsible for the protection and management of the site. The Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area Administrative Bureau (ABJ) consists of several departments, including the Protection Section, the Construction Section, the police station and so on, which are responsible for the field administration. In addition to national legislation, there are many relevant local government laws and regulations. The revised management plan in 2001 is based on these laws and contains specific regulations and recommendations: prohibiting the logging of trees and forests, as well as activities that cause pollution, and fully considering the needs of local Tibetan residents.

<text>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation, titled Dragon Warrior III when initially localized to North America, is a 1988 role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix. It is the third installment in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese release of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as &quot;Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation&quot; on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle. Later in 2021, another remake of the game titled Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, based on the graphical style of &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot; (2018), was announced during the franchise&#x27;s 35th anniversary livestream, and it was eventually released in November 2024 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series consoles.

The first three &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games are part of the same story, and &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; is the first game chronologically, as well as the third game that features the hero Erdrick (Loto in the Japanese releases and Game Boy Color localization). The story follows &quot;the Hero&quot; who is tasked with saving the world from the archfiend Baramos. Gathering a group of companions into a party, the Hero must travel the world, stopping at various towns and locations, and make their way to the Demon Lord Baramos&#x27; lair.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with &quot;Tidy Item&quot; and &quot;Tidy Bag&quot; command, and a &quot;Full HP&quot; command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games were non-linear in structure, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.

=== Classes ===

&quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. At the start of the game, the player begins as a single male or female hero but is able to recruit members at the local tavern. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose to be any of the following of either gender: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character&#x27;s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. A character who changes classes has their stats halved and restarts at experience Level 1, retaining their spells and, in the remakes, their personality. This allows a player to create a character that knows Wizard spells but has the defense of a Soldier. Unlike most &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles in order to win more gold.

In the remakes, after selecting a character, the player can change the character&#x27;s starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a personality trait which affects the growth rate of their abilities. The Hero&#x27;s personality is determined by the player&#x27;s choices and actions during a dream sequence at the start of the game, while other characters&#x27; personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character&#x27;s personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
The game starts in the castle town of Aliahan. Like the rest of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; worlds, this castle is set in a medieval-like time period, complete with knights and magicians. The party explores several caves, ruins, and castles during the adventure. The geography of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; largely corresponds to the actual geography of Earth, and many towns correspond to their real-world cultures, including &quot;Romaly&quot; for Rome, &quot;Portoga&quot; for Portugal, &quot;Assaram&quot; near present-day Iraq (derived from &quot;as-salamu alaykum&quot;), &quot;Jipang&quot; for Japan (where the hero fights Yamata no Orochi) and even a &quot;New Town&quot; in eastern North America that experiences a revolution against an overbearing ruler (derived from the American Revolution against the United Kingdom in 1776).

=== Plot ===
&quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; is set many years before the original &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in a world separate from the first two games. A wicked fiend named Baramos threatens to destroy the world. The story revolves around the Hero, son or daughter (the player can choose to be either male or female, with few gameplay changes) of the legendary warrior Ortega. On their sixteenth birthday, the Hero is summoned to the castle and is given by the King of Aliahan the challenge to rid the world of the evil archfiend Baramos, which Ortega attempted in the past but seemingly perished in a volcano. The Hero then is able to recruit up to three traveling companions to help fight Baramos.

The Hero leaves their home country of Aliahan to travel the world and complete their father&#x27;s quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly&#x27;s crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a sailing ship at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia. Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos&#x27; castle, which is surrounded by mountains.

After defeating Baramos in a ferocious battle and returning to Aliahan, the Hero&#x27;s celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos&#x27;s master and the game&#x27;s true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma&#x27;s castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma&#x27;s monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return to the land and the Hero will not live long enough to stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of &quot;Erdrick&quot; (&quot;Loto&quot; in the Japanese version). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.

== Development ==
As with the other main games in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s scenario was designed by Yuji Horii, whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama, of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; fame. Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. Chunsoft president Koichi Nakamura, co-creator of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, stated he contributed about &quot;10%&quot; of the games programming. The game was released a year after its predecessor, which was finished only five months after the first installment. This reflected an ever-lengthening game development process of the series according to series creator, Yuji Horii. In a 1989 interview, Horii said that developers had perfected the series&#x27; game structure in &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, and this was reflected by the transition from one character&#x27;s quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii&#x27;s dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record . Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, which turned out to be unworkable during &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;s development when the game&#x27;s world map concept was used first by another game maker in &quot;Mirai Shinwa Jarvas&quot;, but Horii&#x27;s team was too far into development to change anything. Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, &quot;Leave him to us! Run! Quick!&quot;

=== 1991 North American localization ===

The game was localized in North America as &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; in 1991 (though not officially released until 1992). Several changes were made in this version. Among them were the addition of a new title sequence (in the original, it was on a simple black screen with the title of the game in the center), and a new prologue which depicted Ortega, who also was given a brand new sprite in this version, fighting a Dragon, and being dragged into the volcano (in the original, the player was unaware of Ortega&#x27;s fate, until talking to the King for the first time). There were also brand new music cues, including one for the title sequence, and one that played after a non-player character death late in the game. To accompany the localization credits, the ending theme was extended to include a reprise of the Alefgard theme. It is unclear whether Sugiyama was brought back to score these new tracks, or someone else was brought in. The menu when starting a new or old save file also added the menu music from &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; (in the original, the menu was silent). Finally, most of the monsters were given a boost in experience points.

=== Remakes ===

The Super Famicom version, released in late 1996, during the last days of the Super NES in North America, was never brought to North America, due to Enix America Corporation&#x27;s closure in 1995. By the time Enix of America returned, the SNES had been discontinued in North America. However, the next remake, for the Game Boy Color, was released in both Japan and the US.

The Game Boy Color version is based on the Super Famicom version. For the North American release of the &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; Game Boy Color remake, Enix decided to give the packaging an anime feel, due to fan demand on Enix&#x27;s message boards. Both remake versions of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; offer many new features and changes. The game received a new translation, incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release, and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a &quot;Teen&quot; rating. It was also one of the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America, with 32 Mb ROM and 256Kb of save-state SRAM on one cartridge. A new class, the Thief, was added to the roster in each of the remakes. Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version, such as Soldier to Warrior. Also, in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at Dhama, which was not allowed in the original. New mini-games were added to the remakes, including Pachisi (called Suguroku in Japan / Treasures and Trapdoors as of the &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; remake), which is a giant board game style adventure from which the player can win items. This game is based on Horii&#x27;s series &quot;Itadaki Street&quot;. The Mini Medal system, which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items, seen in later &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games (it originated in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;), was added. Another medal system, Monster Medals, lets players collect medals from fallen enemies, was added in Game Boy Color remake, and two players could trade Monster Medals via a Game Link Cable. Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over. The remakes feature updated graphics. An overhauled introduction for the game was made, similar to the one in the original &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, which included Ortega&#x27;s battle with the Dragon Queen. Monster and attack animation in battles were added, a feature first introduced in &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;. A personality system was added to the remakes of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. A pre-game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in &quot;Ultima IV&quot; determines the Hero&#x27;s personality. The personality of the other members of the party is determined by the stat-raising seeds that the player gives them during the character generation process. Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up. The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books.

Square Enix released both the Famicom and Super Famicom versions of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; in Japan on September 15, 2011, as part of &quot;Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Collection Famicom &amp; Super Famicom Dragon Quest I &amp; II &amp; III&quot;, a compilation of emulated &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games for the Wii to celebrate the series&#x27; 25th anniversary. A quick save feature was added to these versions, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save file is deleted upon resuming. At the Dragon Quest 35th Anniversary Livestream, a remake of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; was announced in the &quot;HD-2D&quot; style of games like &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot; and &quot;Triangle Strategy&quot;. The remake was released on November 14, 2024.

=== Music ===
Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game. &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s music is featured on &quot;Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 2&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 3&quot;, each album a compilation of music from the first six &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games. This game&#x27;s music has also been featured on other &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; compilation albums, such as &quot;Dragon Quest on Piano Vol. II&quot;, which was released in 1990, and &quot;Dragon Quest Best Songs Selection ~Loula~&quot;, released in 1993. A compilation album of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s music was put on &quot;Dragon Quest III ~And into the Legend...~ Remix Symphonic Suite&quot; and was published by Sony Records in 1996. In 2011 Sugiyama played a concert focused on &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; in his &quot;Family Classic Concert&quot; series he has done for many years, playing fifteen of the games songs.
== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
&quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; sold over one million copies on the first day, with almost 300 arrests for truancy among students absent from school to purchase the game. It set sales records by selling game cartridges in Japan within a day and in a week, and grossing ( at the time, or adjusted for inflation) within a month. It topped the Japanese sales charts from February, through March and April, to May 1988. It became the best-selling game of 1988 in Japan, with 3.8 million units sold, and the best-selling game in Japan between 1986 and 1989, grossing at the time. The original game sold a worldwide total of copies, including in Japan and 95,000 in the United States, grossing several hundred million dollars by 1993 ( adjusted for inflation).

It is often mistakenly thought that in 1988 the game&#x27;s success caused the Japanese government to outlaw further releases of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games on school days. In truth, Enix themselves decided to hold off the release of future &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games until weekends. The North American release of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; did not meet nearly as much success. The North American release&#x27;s poor sales are partly due to the fact that the game was released after the release of 16-bit gaming systems, making it seem archaic to gamers.

The Super Famicom remake sold 1.4 million units in Japan, with nearly 720,000 units sold in 1996 alone. The Game Boy Color version sold a lower 604,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, and eventually became the fifth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 638,551 copies sold. Together with the sales of the remakes, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; is the most successful title in the series and one of the best-selling role-playing games in Japan. As of November 2010, the Japan mobile phone version was downloaded more than 1,000,000 times. Wii &quot;Dragon Quest Collection&quot; sold 403,953 copies in 2011.

=== Reviews and accolades ===
Upon release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (&quot;Famitsu&quot;) magazine reviewed &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and scored it 38 out of 40, making it the magazine&#x27;s all-time highest-rated game up until then. In the 1988 &quot;Famitsu&quot; Best Hit Game Awards, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; won the awards for Game of the Year, Best RPG and Best Character Design. In 1989, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; the award for the best game released since 1983. A survey conducted by &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine in early 2006 among its readers placed &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; as the third most favorite game of all time, being preceded by only &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

In North America, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; was considered an improvement over the first two games, with critics finding the new day/night system and the addition of an in-game bank praiseworthy, but the game was criticized for keeping &quot;the same ugly graphical style and clumsy interface&quot; according to Kurt Kalata of &quot;Gamasutra&quot;. Its reputation has risen in America since its release, primarily due to its gameplay innovations, leading &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; to list it as number 176 on their Top 200 Games list. IGN later listed it as the 96th best Nintendo Entertainment System game. GamesRadar ranked it the 12th best NES game ever made. The staff chose it over the other &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; titles due to its job system which they felt had depth and was influential to video games. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

The Game Boy Color remake received very good reviews from critics. GameSpot gave the Game Boy Color version a &quot;good&quot; 7.6/10, saying that &quot;DWIII is a worthy port of its old NES ancestor, but its firm grounding in the RPG old-school means that only the hard-core need apply.&quot; The publication nominated the game for its annual &quot;Best Game Boy Color Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;. Nintendo Power gave the remake a 4/5, while IGN gave the game a perfect 10/10.

== Legacy ==
The male Hero from this installment appears in the Japan-exclusive mobile game &quot;Dragon Quest Rivals&quot;. He also appears as a guest character in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; via DLC and is officially voiced for the first time by Nobuyuki Hiyama. The game&#x27;s director, Masahiro Sakurai, explained that the Hero&#x27;s inclusion was originally meant to include just the two protagonists from &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot;, but the number would ultimately be doubled to four, including the protagonists from &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; was a survey ship of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy associated with the discovery of Challenger Deep, the deepest point in the oceans. She was laid down in 1930 at Chatham Dockyard and built in a dry dock, before being moved to Portsmouth for completion and commissioning on 15 March 1932.

==Service history==

=== Pre-war surveys ===
Until the outbreak of the Second World War, &quot;Challenger&quot; surveyed the waters around the United Kingdom, Labrador, the West Indies, and the East Indies. On 23 September 1932, she struck a rock north of Ford&#x27;s Harbour, Labrador, in the Dominion of Newfoundland () and was beached. She was later refloated.

=== World War 2 convoys ===
From 1939 to 1942 she served in home waters and as a convoy escort. On 11 January 1941 she was bombed, suffering at least 4 deaths on board. In June and July 1941 she and three s escorted the troop ship from Britain &quot;en route&quot; for Freetown, Sierra Leone. When the troop ship was torpedoed north of the Azores, &quot;Challenger&quot; and the corvette HMS &quot;Starwort&quot; rescued hundreds of survivors and then transferred them to the armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Cathay&quot;.

=== Post-war surveys ===
From 1942 to 1946 &quot;Challenger&quot; surveyed in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific. She returned to Chatham in 1946 for a refit before returning to the Persian Gulf in late 1946. She left the Gulf in 1947 and went to Cyprus where a shore party logged tides. She then proceeded to Gibraltar for another refit in dry dock.

In December 1947 men from &quot;Challenger&quot; and from the two destroyers and were landed in Aden in an attempt to restore order following anti-Jewish rioting.

=== Circumnavigation ===
She circumnavigated the world from 1950 to 1953, surveying in the West Indies and the Far East. It was on this mission in 1951 that &quot;Challenger&quot; surveyed the Mariana Trench near Guam, identifying the deepest known point in the oceans, deep at its maximum, near . This point was named Challenger Deep, in recognition of the fact that, as the mission&#x27;s Chief Scientist Thomas Gaskell explained, [it] was not more than 50 miles from the spot where the nineteenth-century &quot;Challenger&quot; found her deepest depth [...] and it may be thought fitting that a ship with the name &quot;Challenger&quot; should put the seal on the work of that great pioneering expedition of oceanography. In January 1954, &quot;Challenger&quot; returned to Britain, was paid off, and was broken up at Dover.

<text>811 Naval Air Squadron was a unit of the British Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was first founded in 1933, and served during World War II, seeing action in the battle of the Atlantic and on Russian convoys, and was eventually disbanded in 1956.

==Service history==
===Pre-war===
The squadron was formed on 3 April 1933 by amalgamating No. 465 and No. 466 Fleet Torpedo Flights, and served aboard the aircraft carrier in the Home Fleet. Initially equipped with the Blackburn Ripon Mk.II, these were replaced in January 1935 with the Blackburn Baffin, which were in turn replaced by the Fairey Swordfish Mk.I in October 1936. In December 1938 the &quot;Furious&quot; was paid off, and the next year 811 Squadron was assigned to her sister ship . The squadron lost much of its personnel and all of its aircraft when &quot;Courageous&quot; was sunk by a U-boat on 17 September 1939, and the survivors of 811 and 822 squadrons were reformed into 815 Naval Air Squadron.

===World War II===
811 Squadron was reformed in July 1941 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus), near Portsmouth, as a torpedo-bomber reconnaissance squadron, and was equipped with two Sea Hurricanes and fourteen American Vought SB2U Vindicators, which the British called the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. The squadron also received two former civilian Avro 652s (the precursor to the Avro Anson) which they operated until March 1942. The Chesapeake&#x27;s were part of an order originally placed by the French Navy in March 1940, but after the fall of France the order was taken over by the British. The aircraft were fitted with an additional fuel tank and armour, and the single French 7.5 mm Darne machine gun was replaced by four British machine guns. It was intended that they be used as anti-submarine patrol aircraft operating from the escort carrier , but it was soon realised that the Chesapeake lacked the power to fly from such a small vessel while carrying a useful load, and they were reassigned to training squadrons in November 1941, and the squadron received Swordfish Mk.2&#x27;s as replacements.

From August to December 1942 811 Squadron was based at RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, serving under the control of RAF Coastal Command, and flying on anti-shipping and mine-laying operations. In January 1943, the squadron received three Grumman F4F Wildcat Mk.IVs, called the &quot;Martlet&quot; in British service, and on 21 February 1943 flew from RNAS Hatston to embark aboard the escort carrier to serve on convoy escort duty in the battle of the Atlantic. On 22 April &quot;Biter&quot; and the escort destroyers , , and joined convoy ONS-4 sailing from Liverpool. On 25 April a Swordfish from 811 Squadron attacked , which was then sunk by depth charges by &quot;Pathfinder&quot;. The convoy arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 5 April without loss.

From 2 May &quot;Biter&quot; defended the convoys HX 237 and SC 129 from German wolf packs. On 12 May a Swordfish from 811 Squadron, with the destroyer and the frigate , attacked and sank . After arriving at Liverpool, the squadron disembarked and were stationed at RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail).

On 2 June 811 Squadron returned to &quot;Biter&quot; to escort further convoys between Liverpool and Halifax, including ON-207 in October. While at Naval Station Argentia in November, the squadron was supplied with the new American acoustic torpedo, codenamed the Mark 24 mine, but commonly known as &quot;FIDO&quot;. On 17 November a Swordfish smashed into the end of the flight deck of &quot;Biter&quot; while landing in a heavy swell, and its unused FIDO torpedo fell into the sea and exploded, badly damaging &quot;Biter&quot;″s rudder. The carrier managed to return to Rosyth Dockyard for repairs, which took a month.
While &quot;Biter&quot; was under repair 811 Squadron were stationed at RNAS Inskip (HMS Nightjar), finally returning to the ship on 12 January 1944. In early February &quot;Biter&quot; sailed in support of Convoy ONS-29 to Halifax, then transferred to Convoy OS-68/KMS-42 bound for Freetown and Gibraltar. On 16 February, in the Bay of Biscay, 811&#x27;s Martlets shot down a Ju 290 long-range reconnaissance aircraft, which had attempted to attack the convoy escorts with a glide bomb. &quot;Biter&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 25 February where two Swordfish of 811 Squadron spent a week operating out of RAF North Front. On 2 March &quot;Biter&quot; sailed again, escorting the UK-bound convoys SL-150 and MKS-41, and arrived at Liverpool on the 13th. &quot;Biter&quot; continued to escort convoys between the UK and Gibraltar until August 1944 when she was withdrawn from service, for conversion to a transport carrier.

811 Squadron was temporarily based at RAF Limavady in Northern Ireland, serving under RAF Coastal Command, until joining in September 1944 to escort convoys to Russia. 811 Squadron was disbanded on its return in December 1944.

===Post war===
The squadron was reformed in September 1945, and in August 1946 was equipped with the Sea Mosquito TR.33, which was a de Havilland Mosquito FB.VI modified for carrier operations. An early prototype, flown by test pilot Eric Brown, was the first twin-engined aircraft to make a carrier landing, when it touched down aboard on 25 March 1944. Stationed at RNAS Brawdy, Pembrokeshire, 811 Squadron was the only unit to operate this type, which never served aboard a carrier, before it was superseded by the Sea Hornet. The squadron was disbanded in July 1947.

811 Squadron was reformed in the 1950s, with the Hawker Sea Fury, and embarked aboard HMS Warrior dispatched to the Far East for the Korean War. The squadron flew patrols there until the Peace Treaty was signed in 1954. Subsequently, the Squadron reformed flying the Hawker Sea Hawk jet from in mid–1955 and operating from in the Far East and the Mediterranean at the Suez war in 1956, before being finally disbanded the same year.

<text>Lee-on-the-Solent, often referred to as Lee-on-Solent, is a seaside district of the borough of Gosport in Hampshire, England, about five miles (8 km) west of Portsmouth. The area is located on the coast of the Solent. It is primarily a residential area, with an upsurge of mostly local visitors in summer, but was also the former home to the Royal Naval Air Station HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot; (renamed as HMS &quot;Ariel&quot; from 1959 to 1965).

==History==
The district gained its name in the 19th century, during attempts to develop the area into a seaside resort. The area had been referenced long before this, referred to as Lee and numerous variations, including Lebritan. Early impetus for the district&#x27;s development came from Charles Edmund Newton Robinson, who persuaded his father, John Charles Robinson, art curator and collector, to fund the buying of land. Over the period 1884 to 1894 the district was established with the setting out of Marine Parade, a pier, railway connection along with a number of impressive red brick villas. The railway service was discontinued in the 1930s and the pier, unrepaired after breaching in aid of coastal defence in World War II, was demolished in 1958.

Lee-on-the-Solent has had a long association with aviation. Seaplane trials took place at Lee-on-the-Solent as early as 1915. A base for seaplane training was established in 1917 on the former RNAS Lee-on-Solent, later HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot;, site.

The new church of St Faith&#x27;s was built in 1933.

In 1935 the Lee Tower complex was built on the seafront next to the old pier and railway station. It was designed by architects Yates, Cook &amp; Derbyshire, and comprised a white V-shaped Art Deco building with a tower. The complex housed a cinema, ballroom and restaurant, as well as a viewing platform at the tower&#x27;s peak. The complex was demolished in 1971 by Gosport Borough Council, with its land now used for the promenade, remembrance gardens and a car park.

On 1 April 1930 Lee on the Solent became a civil parish, it was formed from Crofton and Rowner. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Alverstoke. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2715.

==Modern times==
New developments in the 1980s and 1990s increased the population. In 2000-2007 1,050 new homes were built at the Cherque farm area of Lee, and further development will take place over the next few years. Elsewhere along Marine Parade, the seafront has lost many of the original villas and hotels to developers.

The Royal Naval Air Station HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot; closed in 1996 but Daedalus Airfield itself remains active as a civil airfield. Aircraft, helicopters, microlight and motorgliders are operated at what is now the principal HM Coastguard search and rescue helicopter base on the south coast. The airfield is operated by Regional &amp; City Airports Management (RCA) on behalf of the owners, Fareham Borough Council. More information about the airfield is available on the website of Daedalus Aviation &amp; Heritage Group.

A planning application was approved in February 2008 for the construction of a Multi-Purpose Driving Test Centre with Motorcycle Manoeuvring Area (MPTC) from the Driving Standards Agency, inside a part of the &quot;Daedalus&quot; site.

The Daedalus site has had housing developments built in recent years, with more re-development planned.

In 2003, the community of Lee-on-the-Solent received nationwide attention for probably the first time in its 120-year existence. The government had proposed to house asylum-seekers at the former base which forms a large area of the resort. At once, the Daedalus Action Group was formed under the chairmanship of John Beavis to oppose the scheme with the support of a large number of local residents. After a U-turn in government policy, the Home Office decided in February 2004 to abandon the asylum centre plan and the action group celebrated with a rally on the seafront. Channel 4 produced a fly-on-the-wall Dispatches documentary &quot;Keep them out&quot; in 2004 dealing with both sides of the argument.

In early May 2006, 20 unexploded Canadian pipe mines were found under HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot; during site clearance prior to disposal by the Ministry of Defence. 60 feet (20 metres) long, they were left over from 265, packed with a total of 2,400 lb of gelignite, planted in World War II to make the airfield unusable in the event of an enemy invasion. The subsequent removal, thought to be the largest of its kind in peacetime Britain, led to the evacuation of some 900 homes staggered over a five-week period.

The district still has a shopping centre, with a selection of independent shops and restaurants and is a popular destination for jet-skiers and kite surfers.

A bypass was built around the time of the Cherque Farm development to link up the B3385 and the B3333 and forms a bypass to Lee-on-the-Solent.

The train has long since gone from the seafront, clearing the seafront for walking, leisure and parking. The seafront is interrupted by the former railway station buildings, the war memorial and the seafront bus stop/parking area opposite the end of Pier Street. This is where the Lee Tower used to stand.

In August 2011 the government announced that the Daedalus airfield would host an enterprise zone named the Solent Enterprise Zone. The CEMAST (Centre of Excellence in Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Advanced Skills Training) campus on the airfield is now open to students. The centre caters for full and part-time students undertaking apprenticeship programmes for companies such as BAE systems and Virgin Atlantic.

In July 2015 parkrun came to the promenade section of Lee on the Solent. The inaugural run had a total of 430 finishers, with around 25 marshals and support people. In the first year there were just over 3,300 runners and 15,000 completed runs. Last year&#x27;s inaugural of 430 was topped in April of this year with a running attendance of 485.

On the last day of July 2018, a &#x27;possibly deactivated&#x27; bomb was discovered &#x27;250 metres south west of the slip way in Lee-on-Solent&#x27;. By August 1, the beach was taped off and The Royal Navy had been called in, alongside the Solent Coastguard, to try to defuse the bomb.

==Places of interest==
The views out to sea from the seafront at Marine Parade are forever changing. From a vantage point on the grassy banks, it is possible to see shipping movements of large container ships and cruisers into Southampton and Portsmouth, sailing boats, ferries and of course the backdrop of the Isle of Wight.

On the seafront on Marine Parade East is the club house of the Lee on the Solent Sailing Club (LOSSC).

At the signal station, where the racing starts and finishes, is a smaller galley that can provide light snacks and soft drinks for the people involved in racing or training at the weekend. It is a RYA accredited Sailing School and is open to visitors and day sailors alike. Boats can be hired.

On Marine Parade West main sea front stands the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s &quot;Lee-on-Solent Memorial&quot;. This was erected to commemorate the 1,926 men of the Fleet Air Arm who died in various parts of the world in World War II and have no known grave.

Lee-on-the-Solent is the home to the Hovercraft Museum which houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of rare hovercraft including some of the earliest and largest. It can be found on the main road along the seafront and hosts an open day every summer. From 2024 it is open every Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 4 pm.

Further towards Gosport is the area known as Browndown. It is a former army firing range and could be considered an interesting walk in summer. There are many old relics to explore, and it is not unknown to find large jellyfish washed up on the shore. Browndown army camp was the setting for the ITV television series &quot;Bad Lads Army&quot;. Browndown army camp is also used as a summer activity camp for young cadets from all over the country. Beyond Browndown eastwards, is the more affluent district and village of Alverstoke and seafront known as Stokes Bay.

The High Street is unique as it is home to over 70 independent shops and businesses, the oldest of which is The Book Shop established in 1933 and still operates in the same building. Many of the buildings in the High Street pre-date this. The High Street has seen a resurgence in recent years due to a number of popular events in the High Street organised by the Lee Business Association, such as Summer in Lee, Lee Victory Festival and Christmas in Lee light switch on.

A short walk from the High Street in Lee is the Lee-on-the-Solent Tennis Club. It has a small bar, a gym, six squash courts (two glass-backed), six tennis courts and a sports therapist.

Lee&#x27;s pubs include The Old Ship, The Bun Penny, The Wyvern and The Inn by the Sea. Some pubs have been demolished to make way for housing and retirement developments, including the Belle Vue Hotel and The Swordfish, which was located on the border between Lee-on-the-Solent and Hill Head, Fareham.

In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Lee library.

==Climate==

Lee-on-the-Solent, like many towns and cities along the south coast, has a milder climate than the rest of the UK, though it is slightly cooler than the nearby City of Portsmouth. The record high temperature is in August 2003 and the record low is in January 1987

Lee-on-the-Solent has a Met Office weather station situated at the MRSC base.

<doc id="984310" wikidata="Q259526" url="?curid=984310" title="Battle of Long Tan">
<text>The Battle of Long Tan (18 August 1966) took place in a rubber plantation near Long Tân, in Phước Tuy Province, South Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. The action was fought between Viet Cong (VC) and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units and elements of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF).

Australian signals intelligence (SIGINT) had tracked the VC 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion moving to a position just north of Long Tan. By 16 August, it was positioned near Long Tan outside the range of the 1 ATF artillery at Nui Dat. Using mortars and recoilless rifles (RCLs), on the night of 16/17 August, the VC attacked Nui Dat from a position to the east, until counter-battery fire made it stop. The next morning D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR), departed Nui Dat to locate the firing positions and determine the direction of the VC withdrawal. D Company found weapon pits and firing positions for mortars and RCLs, and around midday on 18 August made contact with VC elements.

Facing a larger force, D Company called in artillery support. Heavy fighting ensued as the VC attempted to encircle and destroy the Australians, who were resupplied several hours later by two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. With the help of strong artillery fire, D Company held off a regimental assault before a relief force of M113 armoured personnel carriers and infantry from Nui Dat reinforced them that night. Australian forces then pulled back to evacuate their casualties and formed a defensive position; when they swept through the area next day, the VC had withdrawn and the operation ended on 21 August.

Although 1 ATF initially viewed Long Tan as a defeat, the action was later re-assessed as a strategic victory since it prevented the VC moving against Nui Dat. The VC also considered it a victory, due to the political success of an effective ambush and securing of the area around the village. Whether the battle impaired the capabilities of the VC is disputed.

==Background==

The 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) began arriving in Phước Tuy Province of South Vietnam between April and June 1966. Following the establishment of its base at Nui Dat in Operation Hardihood, standing patrols were established outside the base in the evening and clearing patrols sent out every morning and evening along the perimeter. Daily platoon patrols and ambushes were initially conducted out to Line Alpha (), which was the range of the Viet Cong (VC) mortars, but were later extended out to Line Bravo () to counter the threat from artillery.
All inhabitants of Long Phước and Long Hải villages within Line Alpha were removed, and resettled nearby. A protective security zone was established and a free-fire zone declared. Although unusual for allied installations in Vietnam, many of which were located near populated areas, the Australians hoped to deny the VC observation of Nui Dat, and afford greater security to patrols entering and exiting the area. While adding to the physical security of the base through disrupting a major VC support area and removing the local population from danger, such measures may have been counter-productive. The resettlement resulted in widespread resentment.

The VC continued to observe the base from the Nui Dinh hills. Movement was heard around the perimeter over the first few nights as they attempted to locate the Australian defences under the cover of darkness and heavy rain. Although no clashes occurred and the reconnaissance soon ceased, they were believed to be preparations for an attack. On 10 June reports indicated that a VC regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the north west and was about away. The same day three 120 mm mortar rounds landed just outside the base. That night Australian artillery fired on suspected movement along Route 2, but no casualties were found the next day. Further warnings of an attack hastened the call-forward of 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR), which arrived from Vũng Tàu to the south on 14 June. No attack occurred, and the initial reaction to 1 ATF&#x27;s lodgement proved unexpectedly limited.

===Opposing forces===
====Communist forces====
The principal communist units in Phước Tuy were main forces from the 274th and 275th Regiments of the VC 5th Division. Under command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen, the division was headquartered in the Mây Tào Mountains. Operating in Phước Tuy, Biên Hòa and Long Khánh Provinces, it comprised both South Vietnamese VC guerrillas and North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units. Given the task of isolating the eastern provinces from Saigon by interdicting the main roads and highways, including National Routes 1 and 15 and provincial routes 2 and 23, it proved a major challenge to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units that ventured into the province, demonstrating a capacity to mount regimental-size ambushes. The 274th Regiment was the stronger and better trained of the two. Based in the Hát Dịch in north west Phước Tuy with three battalions—D800, D265 and D308—it numbered 2,000 men. The 275th Regiment was based in the Mây Tào Mountains and mainly operated in the east of the province. Commanded by Senior Captain Nguyen Thoi Bung (aka Ut Thoi), it consisted of three battalions—H421, H422 and H421—with a total of 1,850 men.

In support was an artillery battalion equipped with 75 mm recoilless rifles (RCLs), 82 mm mortars, and 12.7 mm heavy machine-guns, an engineer battalion, a signals battalion and a sapper reconnaissance battalion, as well as medical and logistic units. Local forces included D445 Battalion, which normally operated in the south and in Long Khánh. Under command of Bui Quang Chanh (alias Sau Chanh), it consisted of three rifle companies—C1, C2, C3—and a weapons company, C4; a strength of 550 men. Recruited locally and operating in familiar terrain, they possessed an intimate knowledge of the area. Guerrilla forces numbered 400, operating in groups of five to 60, with two companies in Châu Đốc district, one in Long Dat, and a platoon in Xuyên Mộc. In total, VC strength was estimated to have been around 4,500 men.

====Allied Forces====

ARVN forces included the 52nd Ranger Battalion, a unit that had previously earned a US Presidential Unit Citation defeating the 275th Regiment the year before, and relatively weak territorial forces of 17 Regional Force (RF) companies and 47 Popular Force (PF) platoons, in total some 4,500 men. Most villages were garrisoned by an RF company operating from a fortified compound, and PF platoons guarded most hamlets and important infrastructure, but their value was questionable. RF companies were technically available for tasks throughout the province, while PF platoons were mostly restricted to operating around their village. While RF and PF units occasionally defended themselves successfully they rarely conducted offensive operations, and when they did they were usually limited. Mostly recruited from the same population as their opponents, they often suffered equally at the hands of the VC and a largely inept government. Poorly trained and unable to rely on being reinforced, they provided little opposition to the VC. A US Advisory Team operated in support, as did a few Australians from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV); despite their efforts, the capabilities of the ARVN remained limited. The arrival of 1 ATF further restricted their ability to operate in Phước Tuy as it increasingly came to dominate the province.

Initially, 1 ATF, under the command of Brigadier Oliver David Jackson, consisted of two infantry battalions: the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, and 6 RAR under Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend. Other units included the 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron operating M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs); 1st Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, consisting of the New Zealand 161st Battery, two Australian batteries equipped with eighteen 105 mm L5 Pack Howitzers, and six 155 mm M109 self-propelled howitzers from the US A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery Regiment; 3rd SAS Squadron; 1st Field Squadron and 21st Engineer Support Troop; 103rd Signals Squadron; 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters; and an intelligence detachment. Support was provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) at Vũng Tàu, and eight UH-1B Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. US forces provided considerable support including artillery, close air support, helicopter gunships, and utility, medium and heavy lift helicopters. The largest Australian force deployed since the Second World War, it had been rapidly assembled. Although many of its officers and non-commissioned personnel had extensive operational experience, it included many National Servicemen. Few had direct experience of counter-insurgency operations, or first-hand understanding of the situation in Vietnam. The task force was unable to train together before departure.

===Preliminary operations===
With 1 ATF established at Nui Dat, subsequent operations included a search and destroy missions to gain control over Phước Tuy. Seeking to extend its influence beyond Line Alpha, in early July 5 RAR patrolled north through Nui Nghệ, while 6 RAR cleared Long Phước to the south, removing the former inhabitants who had returned since May. 5 RAR then began operations along Route 2, cordoning and searching Dục Mỹ on 19–20 July in preparation for the clearance of Bình Ba, while the SAS conducted long-range patrols to the edge of the Tactical Area of Operations (TAOR) to provide early warning of VC concentrations. With the 5th Division believed able to concentrate anywhere in Phước Tuy within 24 to 48 hours, it was a significant threat. As 1 ATF began to impact the VC&#x27;s freedom of action, a response was expected. Mortar fire and small probes on the Nui Dat perimeter occurred, with such activity considered a possible prelude to an attack. Assessments of VC intentions changed from those of May and June. Whereas previously a full-scale assault was expected, as Nui Dat&#x27;s defences were strengthened an attack against an isolated company or battalion was considered more likely. Other possibilities included skirmishes or ambushes during routine patrolling, or an attempt to interdict a resupply convoy from Vũng Tàu.
By the end of July, a large VC force had been detected by SAS patrols east of Nui Dat, near the abandoned village of Long Tân. In response, 6 RAR launched a battalion search and destroy operation. In a series of fire-fights on 25 July, a company from D445 Battalion attacked C Company, and in the process of retreating assaulted B Company occupying a blocking position. Over the following days, further clashes occurred around Long Tan, resulting in 13 VC killed and 19 wounded, and Australian losses of three killed and 19 wounded. Yet with the inhabitants resettled, the village fortified and the perimeter regularly patrolled, the Australians considered the area secure. Believing VC sympathisers had returned to Long Tân, they searched the area again on 29 July. That afternoon, as 6 RAR commenced a detailed search following its initial sweep, Jackson ordered its immediate return to Nui Dat in response to South Vietnamese reports of a large VC presence close to the base. Although the warnings were unconfirmed and an attack against Nui Dat was considered unlikely, 1 ATF was re-postured. Company patrols were sent out in each direction over the following days, but found little of significance. Jackson had seemed to over-react, and his requests for assistance from US II Field Force, Vietnam (II FFV) were denied. Later intelligence discredited the original reporting and the crisis subsided, but it was indicative of the alarms experienced during the first months of 1 ATF&#x27;s lodgement, and their effect.

After two months, 1 ATF had moved beyond the initial requirements of establishing itself and securing its immediate approaches, and commenced operations to open the province. The task force had penetrated the VC base areas to the east and clashed with D445 Battalion. Operations had been conducted in the Núi Dinh hills to west, Bình Ba had been cleared of VC influence and Route 2 opened to civilian traffic. Yet the ongoing need to secure Nui Dat reduced the combat power available to the task force commander, and it was evident that with only two battalions—rather than the usual three—1 ATF lacked operational flexibility, as while one battalion carried out operations the other was required to secure the base and provide a ready reaction force. Significant logistic problems also plagued the task force, as 1 ALSG struggled to become operational amid the sand dunes at Vũng Tàu, resulting in shortages of vital equipment. By the middle of August, the Australian troops were growing tired from constant day and night patrolling with no respite from base defence duties. A rest and recreation program began, with many granted two days leave in Vũng Tàu, but this further stretched the limited forces available to 1 ATF. Meanwhile, in response to the growing threat posed by the Australians, the commander of the VC 5th Division finally ordered the 275th Regiment to move against Nui Dat.
For several weeks, Australian signals intelligence (SIGINT) had used direction finding to track a VC radio transmitter from the headquarters of the 275th Regiment westwards to a position just north of Long Tân. Extensive patrolling failed to find the unit. The reports began on 29 July at the height of the false alarm, with the radio detected moving towards Nui Dat from a position north of Xuyên Mộc. The movement continued at a rate of a day and by 13 August was located near the Nui Dat 2 feature, a hill in the vicinity of Long Tân, east of Nui Dat. While direction finding indicated the movement of the radio, no actual communications had been intercepted. However it suggested the presence of the 275th Regiment or at least a reconnaissance party of that unit. Jackson could not rule out deception and therefore took the threat seriously when he decided to send company patrols out. The existence of a SIGINT capability was a closely guarded secret, and knowledge of the source of the reports was limited to Jackson, his two intelligence officers, and the 1 ATF operations officer; neither battalion commander had access. On 15 August D Company, 6 RAR patrolled to Nui Dat 2 and returned through the Long Tân rubber plantation. The following day A Company, 6 RAR departed on a three-day patrol on a route which included Nui Dat 2 and the ridge to the north west. Any sizeable VC force in the vicinity would have been located, but neither patrol found anything of significance. SAS patrols focused on the Núi Dinh hills to the west.

By 16 August, the VC force was positioned east of the Long Tân rubber plantation, just outside the range of the artillery at Nui Dat. The Australians thought that Colonel Nguyen Thanh Hong, a staff officer from the VC 5th Division who was likely in overall control, planned the operation. Although VC intentions have been debated in the years since, the aim was likely both a political and military victory to prove their strength to the local population, and undermine Australian public support for the war. They would probably have known one of 1 ATF&#x27;s battalions was involved in the search of Bình Ba, and may have considered Nui Dat weakly defended as a result. Undetected, it likely consisted of three battalions of the 275th Regiment with approximately 1,400 men, possibly reinforced by at least one regular PAVN battalion, and D445 Battalion with up to 350 men. Well armed, they were equipped with AK-47 and SKS assault rifles, RPG-2 rocket-propelled grenades, light machine-guns, mortars and RCLs. Large quantities of ammunition were carried, with each man issued two or three grenades, and grenadiers up to ten or twelve, and a reserve of small arms, mortar bombs and rounds for their crew-served weapons. The 274th Regiment was probably located north west, occupying a position on Route 2 to ambush a squadron of the US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which they anticipated would move down the inter-provincial highway from Long Khánh to support the Australians.

==Battle==
===Opening moves, 16/17 August 1966===

==== Initial assault ====

At 02:43 on the night of 16/17 August Nui Dat was bombarded by the VC, and hit by over 100 rounds from several 82 mm mortars, 75 mm RCLs and an old Japanese 70 mm howitzer fired from a position to the east. Most of the infantry were deployed at the time, with 5 RAR still engaged on Operation Holsworthy while a small party remained at the base. A Company, 6 RAR was on patrol in the north-east of the TAOR, while a platoon from C Company was manning a night ambush to the south-east. The bombardment lasted for 22 minutes, damaging vehicles, tents and wounding 24 men, one of whom later died.

The impact was spread over the south and south-east, with the 103rd Field Battery heaviest hit. The 1st Field Regiment commenced counter-battery fire at 02:50. As the artillery locating radar was suspected of being faulty, the enemy firing position was located manually using compass bearings on sound and flash. With the likely firing point plotted, 240 rounds were fired that made the mortaring cease. The Australians remained alert in case of a ground assault, but this did not occur. The Australian artillery continued to shell suspected VC firing positions and withdrawal routes until 04:10. Although the VC were expected to have withdrawn, several company patrols were dispatched the following morning to search the area east of Nui Dat in response.

==== Pursuing the Vietcong ====
Townsend ordered B Company under Major Noel Ford to prepare for a patrol to locate the firing points which were believed to be in the area between the abandoned villages of Long Tân, Long Phước, and the Nui Dat 2 feature. Having done so, it was to establish the direction of the VC withdrawal. Meanwhile, a platoon from C Company mounted in armoured personnel carriers was to investigate a suspected mortar location south-west of Nui Dat. A Company would continue its patrol in the vicinity of Nui Dat 2, while 7 Platoon, C Company, already conducting a night ambush on the southern edge of the TAOR, would search some sites as it returned that morning. No SAS patrols were deployed as a result of the attack, although several previously had been planned to the north between Bình Ba and the Courtenay plantation in preparation for upcoming operations went ahead. Another patrol was inserted near the Song Rai, north-east of Nui Dat, on the morning of 17 August. The patrol located several tracks about six hours old and headed in a westerly direction that were possibly made by a VC logistics unit. Radio interference and faulty equipment meant that the company was unable to report the information until extraction two days later. Australian intelligence continued to assess a ground attack against Nui Dat as unlikely, with the bombardment an indicator of further offensive action against 1 ATF, Jackson felt he would be unable to adequately respond with only one battalion. 5 RAR was therefore ordered to return to Nui Dat, and was expected back by 18 August.

Although SIGINT had earlier alerted Jackson to the possible presence of a strong VC force in the vicinity of Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing, and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August with just 80 men—some due on leave the following day—they were significantly under-strength, lacking provisions. Crossing the Suối Da Bang creek, the firing point of the mortars was soon located, as were signs of the VC withdrawal. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one VC and wounding two. B Company was subsequently given the task of remaining in the area and searching to the north and east the following day, and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with nothing to report, leaving A and B Company in their night locations. Speculation about the size of the VC in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about VC intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south-east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment.

===Patrolling east of Nui Dat, 18 August 1966===
B Company were due to go on leave, and therefore returned to Nui Dat on the morning of the 18th. At 07:05 the depleted company—reduced to a single platoon and Company Headquarters—continued the search east as far as the edge of the rubber plantation, while A Company searched down the Suối Da Bang towards them. They located several weapon pits and the firing positions of the mortars and RCLs, while discarded stained clothing nearby confirmed the accuracy of the Australian artillery.

At Nui Dat D Company, 6 RAR prepared for its patrol; despite the earlier bombardment, they did not take any extra ammunition with them. Wickens briefed Smith, who assessed that the VC would be incapable of mounting an ambush because of the effectiveness of the Australian counter-battery mortar fire. While the size of the VC force was unknown, the Australians could not discount the possibility that it was part of a larger force preparing to move against Nui Dat. The VC were believed to be able to attack a company-sized force and to launch mortar attacks similar to that the previous morning. Smith then discussed the patrol with Townsend. If B Company located the withdrawal route used by the mortar crews, he was to follow it with the aim of interdiction; otherwise he was to continue the search until it was located. Assuming D445 Battalion to be the only unit in the area, Smith believed that they were looking for that unit&#x27;s heavy weapons platoon of approximately 30 to 40 men. He briefed his platoon commanders accordingly; although he also felt the VC would have long since left the area. Meanwhile, 5 RAR (minus one company) returned to Nui Dat.

==== Troop support and pursuit ====
D Company departed Nui Dat at 11:00 on 18 August led by Smith. They were accompanied by a three-man New Zealand artillery forward observer party under Captain Maurice Stanley, making up a 108-man company. Already behind schedule and with B Company having been out for longer than expected, Smith wanted to relieve Ford and then follow the VC tracks to continue the pursuit that afternoon. Opting for speed, he adopted single file, with 12 Platoon under Second Lieutenant David Sabben in the lead. Despite the heat the company moved at a fast pace, traversing the low scrub, swamp and paddy fields as they closed in on B Company&#x27;s position. 

Meanwhile, the rock and roll acts Little Pattie and Col Joye and the Joy Boys had flown into Nui Dat and were setting up for an afternoon concert. Many of the Australians were disappointed at the prospect of missing the entertainment, and as they patrolled east they occasionally heard the music through the trees. At 13:00 D Company met up with B Company on the edge of the Long Tân rubber plantation, approximately from Nui Dat. D Company moved into all-round defence and posted sentries. While the soldiers had lunch, Smith and Ford inspected the area with a small protection party. The position appeared to have been used by the VC as a staging area prior to the bombardment two nights before, and there were signs that they had evacuated their casualties by cart. The Australians found blood stains and a quantity of equipment and sandals, and examined the mortar and RCL firing locations. After briefing Smith, Ford and the remainder of B Company turned for Nui Dat. D Company subsequently took over the pursuit.

Smith decided to follow signs of a fresh track leading north-east. Setting off at 15:00, D Company paralleled a well-defined track running slightly uphill. Second Lieutenant Gordon Sharp&#x27;s 11 Platoon was in the lead, followed by Company Headquarters, with 10 Platoon on the left under Second Lieutenant Geoff Kendall, and 12 Platoon on the right. Each platoon moved in open formation, with two sections forward in arrowhead and one back, on a frontage of approximately . Moving deeper into the plantation, there were select areas with less visibility. After the track divided into two which ran roughly east-south-east in parallel, apart. At the junction, D Company found evidence of the VC mortars having been prepared for firing, while more scattered equipment was found which again indicated the accuracy of the counter-battery fire and a rapid withdrawal. Unable to cover both tracks, Smith radioed Townsend to discuss the situation. It was decided D Company would take the more easterly track, towards the limit of the range of their covering artillery. Smith adopted a &quot;two up, one back&quot; formation, with 10 Platoon on the left and 11 Platoon on the higher ground to the right. Company Headquarters was in the centre, with 12 Platoon following to the rear. Well dispersed with about between each man, the company had a total frontage of and was about the same in depth. Amid the trees observation was , allowing visual contact between Smith and his platoons. While standard for Australian infantry in such terrain, this spacing was larger than that usually adopted by ARVN or US units.

===Initial contact===
==== First contact with Vietcong ====
D Company moved off again. Shortly after 11 Platoon&#x27;s lead section crossed a dirt road running south-west to north-east. Straight, well-established and sunken with a clearing on either side, it was wide and required them to complete an obstacle-crossing drill to traverse it. At 15:40, just as the forward sections entered the tree line on the other side, but before platoon headquarters could follow, a group of six to eight VC approached their right flank along the track from the south. Unaware of their presence, the VC squad continued into the middle of the platoon. One was hit in a brief action after the platoon sergeant, Sergeant Bob Buick, engaged them, while the remainder scattered. They rapidly moved south-east, and although the Australians believed it just another fleeting contact, artillery was called onto their likely withdrawal route south. After pausing to reorganise, 11 Platoon moved into extended line, sweeping the area and recovering an AK-47 and the body of a VC soldier. Sharp reported to Smith that the VC had been dressed in khaki uniforms and were carrying automatic weapons, yet D445 Battalion soldiers typically wore black and were equipped with US-origin bolt-action rifles or carbines. At the time only main force units were so equipped, but the significance was not immediately apparent. With the area clear following the initial contact, Smith ordered D Company to continue the advance. Meanwhile, Second Lieutenant David Harris was at Headquarters 1 ATF at Nui Dat when the first reports came in. As Jackson&#x27;s aide he was aware of the intelligence being received and believed D Company had clashed with a main force regiment. Harris alerted Jackson, before telephoning Major Bob Hagerty—officer commanding 1st APC Squadron—to warn him of the possible requirement for his standby troop.
Moving forward again, D Company continued east. 11 Platoon&#x27;s rapid follow-up had opened a gap with Company Headquarters, while the two lead platoons were also widely dispersed. 11 Platoon penetrated further into the plantation, widening the gap with 10 Platoon to more than . Although 12 Platoon in the rear covered most of the ground bypassed by the forward platoons, the gap was such that their flanking sections had lost sight of each other, while Smith was unable to see them in the dense vegetation. At that distance, the spacing between the Australians was now greater than the maximum effective range of their weapons. Meanwhile, 11 Platoon had moved forward approximately from the first engagement. As Smith reached the site of the contact, the sound of firing continued to the front as Sharp manoeuvred his sections in pursuit of the withdrawing force. Still in extended line, 11 Platoon came across a rubber tapper&#x27;s hut. Believing sounds coming from it were from VC hiding there, Sharp launched a platoon attack, but the VC had already fled, and the assaulting sections found only two grenades as they swept through the area. Advancing with three sections abreast—6 Section on the left, 4 Section in the centre and 5 Section on the right—they pushed on through the rubber towards a clearing. This formation allowed them to cover a broad front, but offered little flank security.

At 16:08, shortly after resuming the advance, 11 Platoon&#x27;s left flank was engaged by machine-gun fire from a previously undetected VC force, killing and wounding several members of 6 Section. They went to ground and adopted firing positions, only to be engaged by a second machine-gun firing tracer. The firing lasted two to three minutes then stopped, and Sharp then ordered 5 Section to sweep across the front of the platoon from the right. Yet just as they began to move, they came under heavy small-arms and RPG fire from their front and both flanks. Pinned down by the weight of fire, and under threat of being overrun, the isolated platoon was forced to fight for their lives. Over the next 10 to 15 minutes the VC engaged 11 Platoon with heavy fire, putting their left flank out of action. At that moment a heavy monsoon rain began which reduced visibility to just and turned the ground to mud. Assessing the VC to be in greater strength than previously thought and believing they were preparing to assault his position, Sharp called for artillery fire as he moved to bring his exposed section back into line and then gradually withdraw his platoon into all-round defence. He subsequently reported being under fire from a force estimated to be platoon-sized. The Australians had started the contact thinking they were numerically superior and would attack the VC, yet far from clashing with a small force which would try to withdraw before being decisively engaged, 11 Platoon had run into the forward troops of a main force regiment. Beginning as an encounter battle, heavy fighting ensued as the advancing battalions of the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion clashed with D Company, 6 RAR and attempted to encircle and destroy them.

===11 Platoon isolated===
Amid the noise of machine-gun and rifle fire and the VC bugle calls, Stanley brought the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery into action to support the Australian infantry. Yet as he was unable to see them, for safety reasons the initial rounds were directed a distance from 11 Platoon&#x27;s known location, before &quot;walking&quot; the fire in to between of their position, aided by D Company&#x27;s favourable location between the VC and the gunline at Nui Dat, which allowed the rounds to pass over their heads and fall away from them. Landing beyond 11 Platoon, the rounds exploded amid the VC as they began to form up for an assault. But with 11 Platoon engaged from its left, front and right, it became clear the VC force was stronger than a platoon, and was probably at least company-sized. Supported by heavy machine-guns, they launched a series of assaults against 11 Platoon, only to be held off by small arms and artillery fire. As the fighting continued, Stanley realised a single artillery battery was insufficient, and at 16:19 requested a regimental fire mission using all 24 guns of the 1st Field Regiment. The VC continued their assault, surging around the flanks of 11 Platoon. The Australians responded with controlled small arms fire, picking off VC soldiers as the rain and artillery continued to fall. After making the required corrections, Stanley requested another regimental fire mission at 16:22, yet still unable to see the rounds land he had to work entirely from radio communications with 11 Platoon, adjusting the fire over an area of using just a map.
Less than 20 minutes after the first contact more than a third of 11 Platoon had been killed or wounded. Several 60mm light mortar rounds were fired towards the D Company position and although they landed to the east they further separated the remainder of the company from 11 Platoon, putting the main body behind a slight rise. At 16:26 Smith reported to Townsend that D Company was facing a force using mortars, and called for artillery support. Shortly afterwards Sharp was shot and killed after he raised himself to observe the fall of shot. With the platoon commander dead, Buick took charge of 11 Platoon, directing the artillery through Stanley. Unable to extricate itself, 11 Platoon was almost surrounded. Taking heavy casualties and running short of ammunition, Buick radioed for assistance. Soon after the aerial of the platoon&#x27;s radio was shot away and communications lost. Meanwhile, Smith requested an air-strike to deal with the mortars. In response, Stanley organised counter-battery fire from the American 155 mm self-propelled howitzers at Nui Dat, which appeared to silence them.

Meanwhile, 10 Platoon was approximately to the north and Smith ordered it to move up on the left of 11 Platoon to try to relieve pressure on them and allow a withdrawal back to the company defensive position. Dropping their packs, Kendall&#x27;s platoon wheeled to the south-east in extended line, advancing towards 11 Platoon. As they came over a small rise, through the rain they observed a 30 to 40 strong VC platoon advancing south, firing on 11 Platoon as they attempted to outflank them. Advancing to close range before dropping to their knees to adopt firing positions, 10 Platoon engaged them from the rear, hitting a large number and breaking up the attack. As the surviving VC withdrew, Kendall pushed on. Yet shortly after 10 Platoon was engaged on three sides from a heavy machine-gun firing tracer from the high ground of the Nui Dat 2 feature to their left, wounding the signaller and damaging the radio, putting it out of action. Now also without communications, and still from 11 Platoon, 10 Platoon moved into a defensive position, fighting to hold on. Finally, a signaller (Private William &quot;Yank&quot; Akell) arrived from Company Headquarters with a replacement radio, having moved through heavy fire as he tried to locate the platoon, killing two VC with his Owen gun on the way. With the wounded starting to arrive back at Smith&#x27;s position and communications with 10 Platoon restored, he ordered Kendall to pull back under cover of the artillery. 10 Platoon was ultimately forced back to its start point.

===Reaction at Nui Dat===
It appeared the VC would shortly overrun D Company if they were not soon reinforced but no quick reaction force was prepared to deploy at short notice. Consequently, it took several hours to organise a relief force. Although essentially a sub-unit battle fought by a rifle company supported by artillery and co-ordinated by Townsend from the 6 RAR command post at Nui Dat, Jackson was concerned. Not only was D Company in trouble, but the entire force might be under threat. VC radio jamming on the battalion command net forced them to switch frequencies to communicate with D Company. Such a jamming capability was rarely found below divisional-level. Intending to lead the company out himself and take command of the battle, at 16:30 Townsend ordered A Company to prepare to reinforce them, despite themselves only having returned from a three-day patrol an hour prior, and 3 Troop, 1st APC Squadron under Lieutenant Adrian Roberts was warned to be ready to lift the relief force. US ground attack aircraft at Bien Hoa Air Base were also placed on alert by Headquarters 1 ATF. Meanwhile, on hearing the sounds of the fighting while returning to Nui Dat, B Company halted short of the base and was ordered to rejoin D Company. Apparently under close observation by the VC, they were engaged by two 60 mm mortars as they turned around, but took no casualties.

Requiring the task force commander&#x27;s permission to send out the relief force and to accompany it, Townsend telephoned Jackson. Concerned for the safety of the entire force, Jackson was initially reluctant to authorise its dispatch should it weaken the position at Nui Dat. Although he was unsure of the size of the VC facing D Company, from Smith&#x27;s reports it appeared to be at least a regular battalion. Intelligence suggested it was likely from the 275th Regiment, although the location of its remaining two battalions were unknown, as was that of D445 Battalion. The whereabouts of the 274th Regiment was equally unclear. While radio direction finding suggested it may have been near Phước Tuy&#x27;s northern border, three weeks earlier it had been reported close to the western side of the Australian TAOR, and one of its battalions had (incorrectly) been believed involved in an attack on Phú Mỹ in the south-west of the province on 11 August. Consequently, Jackson reasoned that if the battle unfolding near Long Tân was the opening phase of an attack on Nui Dat, the main assault was still to come, and he would need the bulk of his forces to defend the base. He considered the commitment of A Company would tie up the bulk of 6 RAR and the artillery. Yet Townsend believed Nui Dat&#x27;s defences sufficient to deter such an attack, even if they remained incomplete, while the strategic reserve held by US II FFV could also be called upon if required. Ultimately Jackson gave in-principle support to the plan, but would not release the relief force until he thought it was warranted.

===Fighting continues===
By 16:50, it was apparent to Smith that he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength. Yet with his two forward platoons still separated and unable to support each other, D Company was badly positioned for a defensive battle. 10 Platoon had been prevented from engaging the VC attacking 11 Platoon, and was unable to support its withdrawal. Meanwhile, 11 Platoon had gone to ground in extended line following the initial contact, leaving its flanks vulnerable, while its aggressive push forward prior to the engagement also complicated the application of artillery support, which had to be switched to support each platoon as required rather than allowing it to be concentrated. Unable to see either platoon, the D Company forward observer was unsure of 11 Platoon&#x27;s exact position. As a consequence 10 and 11 Platoons were each forced to fight their own battles, and despite the weight of the indirect fire increasingly becoming available to support the Australian infantry, the VC were able to apply superior firepower as they tried to isolate and attack each platoon in turn. To retrieve the situation, Smith planned to pull his company into an all-round defensive position, enabling his platoons to support each other fighting a co-ordinated battle and care for the wounded until a relief force could arrive. The VC moved to overrun the beleaguered force, but the dispersal of the Australian platoons made it difficult for them to find D Company&#x27;s flanks and roll them up, and may have led the VC commander to believe he was engaging a much larger force.
In the meantime, Buick repaired the 11 Platoon radio and re-established communications with company headquarters, and with Stanley, who was again able to adjust the artillery by radio. The VC succeeded in closing to within of 11 Platoon&#x27;s position, and much of the artillery was beginning to fall behind them. Although the fire was probably impacting the VC rear area and causing casualties there, these assault troops had deliberately closed with the Australians to negate its effect. Buick estimated 11 Platoon was being assaulted by at least two companies; down to the last of their ammunition and with just 10 of its 28 present still able to fight, he feared they would soon be overrun, and were unlikely to survive beyond the next 10 to 15 minutes. Confident the rest of D Company would be attempting to reach them, but unable to see how that might occur, Buick requested artillery fire onto his own position despite the danger this entailed. Stanley refused, but after confirming 11 Platoon&#x27;s precarious situation, he was able to walk the artillery in closer. Landing to their front, the artillery detonated among a large concentration of VC troops, destroying an entire assault line as they formed up. At 17:00, three US F-4 Phantoms arrived on station for an airstrike arranged by battalion headquarters.

==== Ammunition shortage and urgent request for support of D Company ====
At 17:02, Smith reported D Company was running low on ammunition and required aerial resupply. With just three magazines carried by each rifleman, they were only lightly equipped prior to the battle. This was a standard load calculated on 1 RAR usage rates which had been enough during previous actions, but it proved insufficient for sustained fighting. Due to the thick vegetation, the ammunition boxes would need to be dropped through the trees, and intending on moving his headquarters behind a low knoll, Smith nominated a point west. This position would afford greater protection, while the helicopters would be less likely to attract ground fire. Yet with their casualties now unable to be moved, D Company would have to remain where it was. Townsend passed the ammunition demand to Headquarters 1 ATF. In response, Jackson requested two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF to deliver it; however, the senior RAAF officer at Nui Dat, Group Captain Peter Raw, was not prepared to risk aircraft hovering at tree-top height in the heavy rain where they would be exposed to ground fire, citing Department of Air regulations. Relations between the Army and RAAF over the use of the helicopters had become increasingly bitter in the preceding months, and were still tenuous despite recent improvements. Jackson requested American assistance, and when the US Army liaison officer responded more favourably, Raw felt no alternative than to accede to the original request, offering to effect the resupply instead. By coincidence, two RAAF Iroquois were available at Nui Dat, having been used for the concert.

Smith called for the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon&#x27;s eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived, but the rain and low cloud obscured the coloured smoke the Australians had thrown to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, but as Smith was unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted the aircraft to move out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft to attack the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing the VC command element to be located there. The artillery fire recommenced as the VC formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend&#x27;s artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries and the American medium artillery. Stanley called down the fire or relayed the direction of the assault, from which Honnor selected targets and ordered the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Although the rain and the soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable conditions: the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting VC, the convenient range of at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued AN/PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.

===12 Platoon attempts to link up with Buick===
Having been repulsed on the left, Smith tried the right flank. Pushing his headquarters forward, he ordered Sabben to move 12 Platoon—until then held in reserve—to support 11 Platoon. As new radio traffic was received, Smith was again forced to ground to work on fresh orders, while the arrival of casualties required the establishment of an aid post in the dead ground, which effectively tied them in location and prevented further manoeuvre. After more than an hour of fighting, D Company was still widely dispersed; 10 Platoon had been unable to break through to 11 Platoon from the north, and there remained only a slight chance 12 Platoon would have more success from the north-west. With the VC enjoying a considerable numerical advantage, Smith feared his platoons would be defeated in detail and that it was only a matter of time before his entire company was overrun, despite the devastating effect of the artillery on the VC assault formations. 12 Platoon departed at 17:15, moving south-east in an attempt to retrieve the now cut-off 11 Platoon, but having been forced to leave 9 Section behind to protect Company Headquarters and support the wounded, with just two sections it was significantly under-strength. Smith requested an airmobile assault to reinforce his position, but due to the bad weather, poor visibility and lack of a suitable landing zone this was considered impossible. Instead, Townsend informed him an infantry company mounted in APCs would be dispatched as a relief force.

At 17:05 Roberts had arrived at the 6 RAR headquarters at Nui Dat with his troop of 10 APCs, and was briefed by the Operations Officer on the situation before departing to pick up A Company from their lines. Yet Jackson was reluctant to reduce the defences at Nui Dat, considering the attack a possible feint. Consequently, although Smith repeatedly pressed Townsend, there was a delay of more than an hour from when the relief force was ordered to ready themselves until Roberts was allowed to move. Townsend finally ordered the relief force to move at 17:30, having received Jackson&#x27;s approval. A Company, 6 RAR and 3 Troop were on standby in the company lines and departed fifteen minutes later. With the route largely dictated by the terrain, the possibility of the relief force being ambushed concerned Townsend and Jackson, but given the dire situation, they saw no alternative, and considered it unlikely, given the ground had been covered by frequent patrols, the proximity of D Company&#x27;s position to Nui Dat, the open country between the base and rubber plantation, and that it was not yet dark. With 5 RAR back at Nui Dat, Jackson ordered it to take over the defensive positions normally occupied by 6 RAR, while deploying a platoon to the 1st APC Squadron lines, and placing D Company, 5 RAR on one hour&#x27;s notice to move if required. The remainder of the battalion prepared to repel any attack on Nui Dat or to pursue the VC if they withdrew.
Meanwhile, after departing D Company&#x27;s position, the two sections from 12 Platoon moved south towards the sound of firing heard approximately away. Unaware of the exact position of 11 Platoon, Sabben instead located the rubber tapper&#x27;s hut previously assaulted by Sharp in the opening phases of the battle. As they advanced, they were forced to fight off an attack on their right flank, before eventually pushing forward another . By this time, the VC had succeeded in pushing behind 11 Platoon in an effort to outflank them, and a large force clashed with 12 Platoon as they attempted to come to their aid. Advancing from the north, two VC platoons then assaulted the Australians, who were now heavily engaged from three directions. Meeting a similar fate to 10 Platoon, Sabben&#x27;s group was forced to ground short of their objective, and were themselves in danger of being encircled. Sustaining increasing casualties, they clashed with several groups of VC trying to move around their western flank to get between 11 and 12 Platoon and form a cut-off force prior to mounting a frontal assault. In so doing, 12 Platoon succeeded in opening a path to 11 Platoon, yet after 45 minutes under fire Sabben was unable to advance any further, and with the rain reducing visibility to just he was unsure of Buick&#x27;s location.

At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company&#x27;s location with the ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they hovered in the heavy rain just above the rubber trees near a small clearing. Because they were to be dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, Private Bob Service of RAAOC and the Administration Company commander, Major Owen O&#x27;Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Without tools to cut the metal straps on the crates, the infantry had to smash them open using machetes or the butts of their rifles. Under heavy fire, the Company Sergeant Major (CSM) Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) Jack Kirby, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby&#x27;s job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply renewed the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but now the Australians resumed firing, forcing the VC back for a third time.

===D Company regroups===

Despite being exposed to heavy fire from three sides, 11 Platoon had maintained its position for over two hours, narrowly holding off the VC with small arms fire and massive artillery support. However, many of the platoon had been killed or wounded, and most of the survivors were now out of ammunition. To their rear Sabben threw yellow smoke in the hope it would be seen through the trees by the beleaguered platoon. Finally, with the close artillery fire causing heavy casualties among the assaulting VC, Buick decided to take advantage of a temporary lull in the fighting to achieve a clean break. Intending to withdraw west to regroup, on his signal the platoon rose to their feet. One of the Australians was immediately shot and killed as he did so, while two more were wounded before they reached a position of temporary safety. From this location Buick could see yellow smoke away, and believing it to be Smith&#x27;s headquarters, 11 Platoon moved towards it in what Buick described as a &quot;mad scramble&quot; in his autobiography, calling out to identify themselves as they approached. Locating 12 Platoon instead, but still finding themselves heavily engaged, the two platoons then moved back to the company position covered by the artillery and torrential rain. By 18:10 D Company had reformed, and the VC appeared to have momentarily broken contact. Having concentrated his company, Smith began to re-organise it into a position of all-round defence.

Smith attempted to place his depleted platoons into a defensible position, but D Company&#x27;s location had been dictated by the actions of the VC and the need to care for the wounded, and as a result they had little choice of where to make their stand. However, with the Australians occupying a shallow fold in the ground on a reverse slope the terrain proved decisive. The VC found it difficult to use their heavy calibre weapons effectively and could only engage at close range. The jungle covered Nui Dat 2 feature lay to the north-east, and an impenetrable wall of thick bamboo and scrub abutted the lower slopes to the west. The remainder of the position faced the relatively open rubber plantation. Believing the northern approach unsuitable for a major assault, Smith assessed the most likely VC courses of action to be a frontal assault from the east, or a flanking attack from either the south or south-west. As a consequence, he placed 10 and 12 Platoons in positions on the southern and eastern flanks, while the badly mauled 11 Platoon was allocated a position to the north-west. Company Headquarters was located in the south-west. During the lull, Smith walked around the position to gain an understanding of the situation and check the wounded. With one platoon almost destroyed, and the other two at approximately 75 per cent strength, D Company had been battered but morale remained high. Kirby completed the distribution of ammunition and Stanley plotted new defensive fire tasks for the artillery.

The respite proved brief as the VC soon located the Australian position. At 18:20 they re-engaged D Company with concentrated machine-gun fire from the east and south-east as they reorganised for a further attack. Movement was soon detected through the trees; however, at a distance of the Australians thought they may have been B Company, and only engaged the VC as they moved out of range to the north. By following up the withdrawal of 12 Platoon and conducting probes, the attackers succeeded in confirming D Company&#x27;s position. A company-sized VC force formed up to the south on a broad frontage which threatened to engulf them. The assault commenced at 18:35, with several bugle blasts marking the beginning of a series of attacks against D Company. Well spaced, the assault force stepped-off at a fast walk supported by a company in reserve which moved to their rear. Yet as they did so an accurate barrage from the Australian artillery fell among them, effectively destroying the rear echelon. The assault force continued on, only to be engaged with small arms just from the forward Australian positions. Lacking any reserve, the assault was halted, although many of unwounded attackers attempted to crawl around the D Company perimeter, and snipers fired from the trees.

A second assault soon advanced over the same ground, only to again be hit by artillery, with those unscathed going to ground among the dead and wounded. As they moved forward, they were joined by survivors of the first assault and together attempted to roll over the Australians. The VC then tried to site another heavy machine-gun from the D Company perimeter, but Kirby killed the crew. Despite the casualties, attacks continued, supported by machine-guns. The main attacks came from the east, south-east and south, falling on 10 and 12 Platoons, with smaller ones elsewhere. However, due to the slope of the ground, much of the fire passed over the heads of the defenders. The slope likewise screened the advancing VC, preventing either side from effectively firing on the other until the VC closed within 50 metres, but few survived the artillery fire to get that close. Meanwhile, the VC had set up a light and a heavy machine-gun on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 and these continued to engage the Australians. While they were able to achieve plunging fire from this vantage point, they were unable to observe D Company&#x27;s position through the rubber trees and so were reduced to sweeping a broad area. Australian casualties included four killed and several wounded during this period, the majority from head and chest wounds.

===A Company and 3 Troop fight through===
By 18:45, D Company had succeeded in moving into an all-round defensive position, throwing back heavy attacks With D Company unable to manoeuvre, the initiative lay with the VC, the 1 ATF&#x27;s artillery holding them at bay, with the main role of the infantry increasingly becoming one of protecting their forward observer. Stanley&#x27;s efforts remained crucial to the survival of D Company, with the ability to strike artillery more precisely in closer combat. The close fire devastated the VC ranks, however a mistake led to the wounding of a member of D Company. Nonetheless, D Company was heavily outnumbered, unlikely to survive another assault; a simultaneous attack would completely overrun them. The battle&#x27;s outcome rested on whether they could keep the VC at bay long enough for reinforcements. A fresh force was observed moving to the west, likely an attempt to encircle and cut off D Company.

==== Initial delays of the relief force ====
The relief force had been delayed by several factors, including flooding from the heavy rain, VC action, poor equipment, limited communications and an ambiguous command relationship between the armour and infantry. 3 Troop was exceedingly exposed, with their APC strength reduced from 13 to seven, with the remainder undergoing maintenance, many of the remainder marred with mechanical errors. In an attempt to supplement their APC&#x27;s, three vehicles from 2 Troop, devoid of gun shields, were used leaving the crew commander exposed. Mounted in the carriers, the 100-strong A Company (6 RAR) departed Nui Dat ordered to relieve pressure on D Company by attacking from the south and then to reinforce them and secure the area to allow the evacuation of the wounded. With few gaps in the Nui Dat perimeter wide enough for the APCs, a longer route was taken, and a diverted exit led to further delays until an alternative was located. At 17:55, after finally clearing the wire, Roberts was ordered to send two APCs back for Townsend and to wait until he came up, as he intended to accompany the carriers rather than move by helicopter. Detaching two APCs, Roberts ignored the second part of the order and the remainder of the troop proceeded, leaving Nui Dat at 18:00.

As the rain began, Roberts moved along the edge of the rubber plantation north-east of Long Phước in column towards the heavily swollen Suối Da Bang. The terracing of the paddy fields resulted in a steep drop to the creek and a difficult climb out; however, using a bullock track alongside a dam, Roberts swam the carriers across the water, despite the threat of fast flowing water At 18:10, Roberts was ordered for a second time to halt and wait for Townsend. Continuing to monitor D Company&#x27;s situation over the radio, he again chose to disregard the order. After crossing without incident, Roberts left one carrier and its infantry to secure the point (and to act as a guide for Townsend), while the remaining seven APCs moved towards the battle. Advancing another kilometre, by 18:20 they reached the junction leading directly to the fighting; using it as his centre axis, Roberts deployed one section of three APCs on the right commanded by Sergeant Ron Richards and one on the left under Sergeant Leslie O&#x27;Reilly, each with two vehicles forward and one back evenly spaced approximately 40m apart, while he remained in the centre moving astride the road. They rapidly began to advance on a 300m frontage. Despite being again ordered to wait by Townsend, Roberts once more decided to press on.

==== Battle with D445 Battalion and further small battles ====
The relief force moved into the plantation in open formation, unaware of the location of D Company or the VC. With visibility limited by the low vegetation of the young rubber trees and the heavy rain, they suddenly encountered a company moving west in arrowhead dressed in greens, cloth hats and webbing. Realising they were VC attempting to outflank D Company, Lieutenant Peter Dinham ordered the crew commander to engage.

The rain had masked their approach and the VC (D445 Battalion), initially caught by surprise, returned fire. Dinham ordered the rear door open and the remainder of the Australians in the APC—consisting of platoon headquarters and one section—disembarked to protect him. Moving into extended line, they advanced, engaging the VC and causing heavy casualties. The spontaneous assault caught them by surprise, adding to their growing disorder. All serving to delay the relief force. After re-embarking the infantry, 3 Troop resumed the advance, breaking into the VC force as it streamed west, firing their .50 calibre machine-guns and small arms. D445 Battalion was forced to withdraw east, having lost an estimated 40 killed, while one Australian was wounded.

3 Troop continued forward in assault formation, moving deeper into the plantation, with improved visibility allowing them to increase speed. By 18:30. B Company was also drawing near on foot, and observed the VC moving around the western flank, likely to escape the APCs. Shortly after, they were accidentally engaged by the APCs and lost one man wounded. After moving a further 200m, the relief force came out of the tree-line and were confronted by groups of 8 to 10 VC moving east, in total about 100 men, believed to be the lead elements of the force that had just been struck, now withdrawing after abandoning its attempt to outflank D Company. The APCs opened fire, engaging their flank with heavy machine-guns. A number were hit while others turned to engage the APCs as it closed with them. A 57 mm RCL then fired on one of the APCs at close range with the round narrowly missing and blowing apart a tree which fell across the vehicle. The crew commander, Corporal John Carter, engaged the anti-armour team from the top of the APC as they reloaded, but his .50 calibre machine-gun jammed as they fired again, and he killed two of them with his Owen gun from just . The second RCL round subsequently detonated against the fallen tree, saving both the vehicle and its occupants. Despite being dazed, Carter killed three more VC soldiers as he scrambled back into the carrier, which was now without communications following the destruction of its aerial. By drawing further fire he allowed the remainder of the troop to advance.

The potential presence of a second RCL team sited in mutual support forced the APCs to halt, once again. Concerned about the danger of bypassing an anti-armour weapon only to be engaged from the rear, Roberts ordered the troop to scan the area. Frustrated by the delay, Mollison demanded Roberts continue the advance, and an argument broke out between the two. As commander of the APCs, Roberts ignored the senior ranking Mollison, refusing to continue until he either located the weapon or was confident the threat did not exist. After a five-minute delay, with no weapon located, the Australians moved off again. A machine-gun engaged three APCs without gun shields. Under heavy fire, the troop sergeant ran between the carriers to take command of the APC, after Roberts ordered him to return to Nui Dat due to the mistaken belief some of the infantry on board had also been wounded. Despite Mollison&#x27;s objections, the vehicle departed, taking the headquarters of one of the infantry platoons with it. Still uncertain of the location of D Company, Roberts was forced to closely control the fire of the troop due to the concern any survivors might be hit by overshoots from the armoured vehicle&#x27;s heavy machine-guns. At the same time, the infantry continued to engage from the rear of the vehicles. A further 45 VC were estimated to have been killed during this action.

===D Company reinforced===
Unaware of the hold up on the left flank, the right hand section of APCs continued to advance. Pressing on, the section moved through the friendly artillery fire targeting the D445 Battalion as it had attempted to outflank D Company. As they moved closer to D Company the carriers were engaged by small arms and RPGs, continuing through and returning fire. The arrival of the carriers inspired the surviving members of D Company to stand and cheer. At the same time, Dinham&#x27;s platoon dug in at the Eastern flank of D Company, awaiting the arrival of the remainder of A Company. To the west Roberts and the three remaining carriers of 3 Troop had resumed the advance and linked up with Richards at a junction in the road south-west of D Company. Townsend arrived with elements of his headquarters aboard three more M113s at 18:50. Following a number of uncoordinated manoeuvres by the APCs Townsend took command, and with the light failing he ordered Roberts to assault from the west into the flank of the main VC force.

==== Arrival of the APCs and turning tide of the battle ====
Bolstered to nine M113s, 3 Troop again moved forward through the artillery fire with Roberts spreading the additional APCs across the rear of his formation for depth. Utilising a track as a guide he reformed the troop into a wide assault formation. Beginning the advance at 18:55, 3 Troop prepared for a frontal assault on the VC force. Continuing past D Company to their left, the APCs moved forward rapidly, firing their machine-guns. A brief but heavy engagement occurred, with the VC responding with automatic fire, including tracer and explosive rounds, mostly missing. Arriving at a crucial point in the fighting, the APCs turned the tide of the battle. The VC had been massing for another assault which would likely have destroyed D Company, yet the additional firepower and mobility of the APCs broke their will to fight, forcing them to break contact and begin to withdraw as night approached. At 19:00 the 32-strong group from B Company finally entered D Company&#x27;s position, even as the APCs continued to assault the VC. After a long approach under mortar fire and the threat of ambush by a superior force, Smith placed Ford on the western side of the D Company defensive position to act as a screen to allow them to treat their wounded and prepare to resist a counter-attack. 3 Troop swept forward with the APCs continuing to assault a further before Townsend ordered their return. Turning north-west, Roberts moved back to the company location at 19:10. Yet even as they did so the VC continued to attack from the north-east, although this too was soon broken off.

Linking up with D Company, the APCs moved through the company position. Around the perimeter the Australians engaged the withdrawing VC, while the APCs moved into a line from north to south on the eastern side of the company position. A Company disembarked and took up firing positions between the vehicles, joining 2 Platoon. The artillery had been almost constant throughout the battle and had prevented D Company from being destroyed. By 19:15 the firing had ceased and as darkness fell they prepared for the VC to mount another attack. Although snipers continued to engage the Australians there were no further assaults and the battle came to a conclusion. The APCs formed a hollow square around D Company. With the VC at least temporarily driven off, the Australian position was now more strongly held and additional ammunition had been brought in by the APCs, but it was now dark and they would be unable to receive further reinforcement, while the ability of the VC to mount a night attack was unknown. Meanwhile, the expenditure of artillery ammunition had been high and an urgent demand for 1,000 rounds was submitted by 1st Field Regiment, RAA at 19:30 in case the fighting continued. However, with arrangements for the emergency aerial resupply of Nui Dat by night still being worked out, and with a road resupply by 1 ALSG in danger of being ambushed, it took several hours for the rounds to be loaded and delivered by CH-47 Chinook from Vũng Tàu.

==== Townsend assuming command of D Company ====
Townsend assumed command as the defenders regrouped, while Kirby co-ordinated the collection of the dead and wounded. In total, one of the platoons had been destroyed and D Company was &quot;non-effective&quot;, with five dead, 16 wounded and 16 missing. VC losses were believed to have been heavy; but with no confirmed casualty figures it looked to the Australians like they had suffered a defeat. The two officers agreed it would be impossible to secure the battlefield or to attempt to locate the missing from 11 Platoon in the darkness, and after it became clear the VC were not going to counter-attack, Townsend ordered a withdrawal to a position to the west from whence their casualties could be evacuated. Handling the dead and wounded proved a slow process but with the casualties finally loaded onto the carriers D Company left at 22:45, while B and A Companies departed on foot 45 minutes later. Roberts established a landing zone by forming a square and illuminated it with the interior lights of the APCs by opening their top hatches. The artillery fire ceased as the evacuation commenced with the first casualties taken out by a US Army Dustoff helicopter, while the remainder were extracted by six UH-1Bs from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Despite being slowed by the requirement for the helicopters to land without lights, the operation went smoothly and was completed after midnight. The last casualties were taken out by 00:34, and flown to the Australian hospital at Vũng Tàu.

During the night the artillery continued to fire on likely VC forming-up points, although 11 Platoon&#x27;s final position was avoided for fear of hitting any survivors, while US aircraft bombed likely withdrawal routes to the east. Forming a defensive position ready to repulse an expected attack the Australians remained overnight, enduring the cold and heavy rain. Although they were now in a better position to hold off an attack, further reinforcement from 1 ATF at night was difficult and was therefore unlikely. Yet with the VC spent no further attack was mounted. Smith and Townsend spent the night in the back of one of the carriers planning the clearance of the battlefield and pursuit of the VC, which was scheduled for the following day under the codename Operation Smithfield. Jackson stipulated the force was to remain within artillery range, but would otherwise have freedom of action to complete the exploitation over the next two to three days. Townsend requested the remaining APCs bring out 6 RAR headquarters, C Company and a section of mortars the following morning, while D Company, 5 RAR would also be placed under his command for the operation. However, with a company from 5 RAR still in Bình Ba, the bulk of 1 ATF&#x27;s remaining combat power would be deployed as part of the clearance, leaving just two companies from 5 RAR to defend Nui Dat. Smith was determined to recover the missing from 11 Platoon, and despite its losses, D Company would lead the assault.

===Clearing the battlefield, 19–21 August 1966===

By morning the weather had cleared. At 06:55 the remainder of 6 RAR departed Nui Dat with 2 Troop, 1st APC Squadron, while D Company, 5 RAR departed at the same time aboard US Army helicopters. Meanwhile, at 07:40 Jackson arrived at 6 RAR&#x27;s night location to observe the clearance, flying in as Townsend gave orders for the operation. Stepping off at 08:45, the Australians returned to the battlefield in strength, while artillery and airstrikes continued to hit the area. The battalion group moved in a &quot;two up&quot; formation with D Company, 5 RAR and D Company, 6 RAR both mounted in APCs as the forward left and forward right assault companies, followed by A, B and C Companies in depth, each dismounted. The assault companies planned to sweep the area then dismount and commence a detailed search, while the others would clear the surrounding features and begin the follow-up. Moving cautiously in case the VC launched a counter-attack, they advanced along the route used by D Company, 6 RAR the previous day. The battlefield was a scene of devastation, with rubber trees stripped of leaves and branches and bleeding sap, while the area around D Company&#x27;s final position was heavily cratered. At 09:21 D Company, 5 RAR reported finding the body of a dead VC soldier; while half an hour later D Company, 6 RAR found 12 to 15 more. A large number of VC dead were found, including a 60 mm mortar crew. At 10:20 a bulldozer was requested to bury the bodies of approximately 100 VC soldiers.

==== Scale of Vietcong defeat and treatment of wounded Vietcong ====
By late morning, a total of 113 bodies and two wounded had been found, while numerous drag marks and blood trails indicated many more casualties had been moved the previous night. With the clearance continuing, two wounded VC still bearing arms were killed by D Company, 6 RAR after they moved to engage them, while in a separate incident another wounded soldier was also killed. A third wounded VC was later captured; and all three wounded were given first aid then being evacuated. These events later caused controversy when journalist Ian Mackay published claims in 1968 that the Australians had deliberately killed unarmed VC wounded, citing a &quot;witness&quot; to the alleged incident; while a major newspaper stated they had killed wounded &quot;civilians&quot;. An official investigation determined the allegations were exaggerated and based on hearsay, with the soldier claimed as the source found not to have been present during the fighting and those killed confirmed to have been armed. Similar accusations were made in 1986 by Terry Burstall, a former D Company soldier, who claimed up to 17 wounded VC had been executed, although they were also refuted, and his credibility challenged. In 2000, Buick admitted in his memoirs to having killed a mortally wounded soldier the day after the battle as an act of mercy. Burstall argued this may have constituted a breach of the Geneva Convention; while Buick&#x27;s decision to publish was questioned by John Heslewood, the President of the Australian Long Tan Association and a private in 11 Platoon during the battle. Mollison later also criticised Buick&#x27;s actions. In his 2015 autobiography, Harry Smith states that two mortally wounded VC soldiers were killed on 19 August out of compassion, one by Buick and another by a soldier from A Company, 6 RAR.

==== Recovery of lost Australian troops ====

At 11:00 6 RAR reported they had located the bodies of the missing members of 11 Platoon, who were found lying in a straight line where they had been killed, largely undisturbed and still holding their weapons. The majority were from 6 Section, which had been the first to be hit. One man was found to have survived despite his wounds, having spent the night on the battlefield in close proximity to the VC as they attempted to evacuate their own casualties. Another wounded soldier had been found nearby, leaning against a tree but still alive. Both were evacuated, and later recuperated in hospital. Thirteen Australian dead were also recovered, accounting for all the missing. As the search continued, VC dead were found up to south-east of the position reached by 11 Platoon. A large bunker complex was uncovered consisting of 200 pits with overhead protection sufficient for a battalion, but its layout suggested it had been constructed as a defensive position rather than for an ambush. Another position of 100 pits was found to the east. By 14:35, the total number of VC dead was reported as 168. A large amount of weapons and equipment were uncovered, including assault rifles, mortars, light machine guns, submachine guns, an RCL, plus ammunition and grenades. By 18:10, the figure had risen to 188 VC dead, with shallow graves dug by the Australians to bury them where they were found.

Due to the likely presence of a significant force nearby, the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the VC. Over the next two days, they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering more dead as they did so. Yet, with up to two VC battalions still believed to be in the area and the continued vulnerability of Nui Dat to attack from the 274th Regiment, Jackson lacked the resources to pursue the withdrawing force. Company patrols searched up to east, and to the north of Nui Dat 2. The search area was subsequently expanded to include that contested during Operation Hobart. Several tracks were found with telephone cables running along them, as well as more drag marks, blood stains, discarded equipment, fresh graves and evidence of use by heavy cart and foot traffic. The main VC withdrawal route was discovered after midday on 19 August. Townsend requested permission to follow it, believing he had sufficient forces, but Jackson would only permit 6 RAR to advance a further , remaining within artillery cover, and would not allow the guns to move forward to increase the range of their protective fire. By 20 August, the Australians had counted 245 VC dead, while scores more were found later. Up to four weeks after the battle, decomposed bodies were still found in the area, while numerous graves were also located, none of which were included in the estimates of VC losses. The bodies found later brought the total to about 300 dead. D Company, 5 RAR returned to Nui Dat early on 21 August, while D Company, 6 RAR was withdrawn for two days leave in Vung Tau.

The rest of 6 RAR continued the search, with A Company discovering a series of freshly built and recently abandoned hides along the VC withdrawal route, which were believed to have been prepared as delay positions. An older defensive position of approximately 40 pits was also found, while C Company located a makeshift hospital close by containing 14 graves. Both had recently been occupied. Later, an Australian OH-13 reported the presence of scattered groups of civilians, with the largest numbering 30 to 40 people—mostly women with baskets and bags, while others had ox carts—believed to be carrying medical supplies. These reports were followed up by the 1st APC Squadron and a number of military age males were detained for questioning. The infantry companies completed their search by midday, moving to the edge of the rubber plantation, north-east of Long Tân. Smithfield concluded at 17:00, with the Australians returning to Nui Dat by helicopter and APC by 17:30. They had hoped to catch the remnants of the VC force before they could reach their mountain sanctuaries, but the operation failed to prevent their withdrawal. Some Australian officers later questioned the caution with which it was conducted. Jackson felt unable to mount a pursuit due to the continued threat posed by the 274th Regiment, which was still believed to be in the area. With 1 ATF lacking the resources required for such an operation, the opportunity to trap and destroy the VC while they were still vulnerable was lost and they made good their escape.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===

VC and PAVN casualties were claimed by the Australians to have numbered 245 dead left on the battlefield and three captured, with many more were thought to have been removed as they withdrew. Others were so badly mutilated their remains were unidentifiable. Approximately half were believed to have been caused by artillery and the remainder by small arms. The initial estimate was given by an Australian Army spokesman, and some participants in the battle regarded them as inflated. 

They were disputed by two prominent Australian military writers that fought in Vietnam , with reports by a D Company veteran stating actual body counts as no more than 50. The 6th RAR War Diary reports that on 19 August no more than fifty Vietnamese dead were recovered and buried in the battlefield. Second Lieutenant Eric Andrews from C Company 6th RAR says his 8 Platoon was given the job of burying the 52 enemy dead reported to have been found on the battlefield. The Vietnamese Official History of the battle records 47 dead and another 100 woundedwith 30 reported killed from the 275th Regiment and the remainder killed from D445 Battalion or smaller attached units or through their wounds, according to the research done on the part of the A Company commander, Captain Charles Morrison, primarily by artillery fire. 

The Quartermaster&#x27;s notebook of the 275th Regiment that was reportedly captured in early February 1968 by the Australian-New Zealand Battalion during Operation Coburg, reveals that 111 were wounded in the 275th Regiment, but there are no details of the wounded in D445 Battalion. Another estimate was 150 casualties according to Colonel Bao who was overall district commander, but did not directly participate. Captain Robert O&#x27;Neill (Intelligence Officer, 5th RAR) claims that no real evidence of heavy casualties in the form of makeshift operation centres, amputated limbs, graves, bloodied clothing, heavy blood-trails or drag marks were found in the deep sweep conducted by the 5th Battalion of the enemy withdrawal route from the Long Tan rubber plantation.

Ernie Chamberlain, Australian military writer and veteran of the Vietnam war, says that Vietnamese duplications of the names of their veterans of the battle appear to be the main reason behind much of the confusion generated over the real number of the attackers involved and enemy dead at Long Tan. His research at first provided, the names, personal details and &quot;giay bao tu&quot; (death certificates) of 190 confirmed killed from the 275th Regiment, then later a revised list of 176 fatal casualties from the same Vietnamese unit. Many were reportedly killed or mortally wounded on the battlefield or may have died while undergoing emergency surgical operations during the retreat, according to his findings.The figure of 176 was soon, however corrected to 96 in his revised edition of his book.

Earlier on, in November 2011, Chamerlain had been contacted by a member from the Hà Nội-based Vietnamese &quot;Missing In Action&quot; Non-Government-Organization (NGO) informing him that &quot;397 VC&quot; had died at Long Tan. This death toll soon made the rounds in several Vietnamese newspaper articles covering the fighting that took place on 18 August 1966.The claim in the Vietnamese media, that 397 Vietnamese soldiers fell at Long Tan was soon discarded for it was more than likely based on original Australian reports from the battleield of 245 enemy killed and another 150 wounded that were dragged away.

After contacting Harry Smith and exchanging views of the battle as well as valuable documents and books, the former Australian Rifle Company Commander appears to have accepted much of the findings of Chamberlain and settled for a lower figure of 134 killed in the 275th Regiment and another 39 killed in supporting units.

In 1996, on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, experienced journalist Mark Baker, working at the time with The Sydney Morning Herald and investigating the number of Vietnamese attackers involved and their fallen, travelled to Vietnam to meet with the veterans group that fought as part of the 275th Regiment and after sitting down with the former commanders and shifting through all the available evidence wrote that &quot;[The] senior Vietnamese officers made the startling claim that only 700 of their men had taken part in the battle — half the most conservative Australian estimate — and that only 30 had been killed.&quot;

The recovered 275th Regiment Quartermaster sergeant&#x27;s notebook records on 20 August (two days after the battle at Long Tan) the number of available men in his regiment to be 852, 159 less men than the total strength of 1,011 (including rear-echelon units) recorded on the eve of battle, indicating 150 killed, wounded and missing in the battle. The notebook also included a detailed listing of 111 personnel who had fought at Long Tan, that could very well be in the opinion of retired army brigadier Chamberlain, the 275th Regiment’s full list of wounded in the battle. A former senior officer (Nguyen Van Kiem) in D445 Battalion claimed that his unit suffered approximately 30 killed and wounded at Long Tan. A former platoon sergeant (Nguyen Van Nhuong) in D445 says casualties in his battalion were 10 killed in action with another 16 wounded.

The Australians estimated the VC had evacuated up to a further 350 casualties, including an unknown number of dead buried along the withdrawal route. With such losses representing the operational strength of two battalions, Australian intelligence assessed that the 275th Regiment, which had borne the brunt of the fighting, would be incapable of mounting a regimental-sized operation for several months, but the 275th Regiment carried out attacks against the ARVN 18th Division a week later. D445 Battalion, thought to have played a supporting role and to have suffered less heavily, was assessed as still capable of engaging forces up to company size, with a remaining strength of 300 men. McNeill states that this was based on the capture of the diary of the battle commander Nguyen Thoi Bung, who later became the Deputy Defense Minister of Vietnam; but according to Ernest Chamberlain this has not been corroborated. A captured soldier stated D445 Battalion&#x27;s casualties had been 70 killed and 100 wounded.

Whether the combat effectiveness of D445 and the 275th Regiment was eroded is in dispute, as the D445 were redeployed in September and October against the newly deployed 11th Armored Cavalry Taskforce, while the 275th were combat-capable a week later. Weapons captured included 33 AK-47s, seven RPD light machine-guns, five SKS rifles, four RPG-2 launchers, two 57 mm RCLs, two M1 carbines, a PPSh-41, Thompson submachine-gun, Browning Automatic Rifle, M1 Garand and an SGM heavy machine-gun. More than 10,500 rounds of small arms ammunition was recovered, as well as 300 hand grenades, 40 mortar bombs, 28 RPG-2 rockets and 22 RCL rounds.

Australian losses were 17 killed, one died of wounds and 24 wounded: approximately one third of the initial force engaged. A high proportion were National Servicemen, drawing criticism in Australia where conscription for overseas service was increasingly controversial. The government later limited the number of conscripts to no more than 50 per cent of a unit, requiring a rapid and disruptive reorganisation within 1 ATF.

===Recognition===
In the aftermath, both sides claimed success. Heralded as an Australian victory against overwhelming odds, the battle was widely covered in the Western press, making headlines in Australia and the United States. 1 ATF received congratulatory messages from the US, South Vietnamese and Australian military commands in Vietnam, and from Prime Minister Harold Holt, while General William Westmoreland considered it one of the more spectacular allied victories to that point in the war. Despite their losses, the VC claimed to have inflicted a heavy defeat on the Australians. Shortly afterwards, leaflets circulated the province stating that &quot;700 Australians were killed, one battalion and two companies were destroyed and two squadrons of APCs&quot;. Similar claims were repeated on Radio Hanoi on 27 August 1966, and the day after on Radio Peking. In contrast, the Vietnamese history of Dong Nai Province published in 1986 gave the battle little attention, claiming to have &quot;eliminated 500 Australians and destroyed 21 tanks&quot; while their own losses were not recorded. D445 Battalion later received a PAVN heroic unit citation, and the 275th Regiment may have been given a similar award. Many VC soldiers were also awarded Certificates of Commendation for their role in the fighting.
D Company, 6 RAR was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation by President Lyndon Johnson on 28 May 1968. The Royal Australian Regiment and 3rd Cavalry Regiment were later awarded the battle honour &quot;Long Tan&quot;, one of only five presented to Australian units during the war. Commonwealth decorations were made to 17 Australians and New Zealanders, including Smith who received the Military Cross (MC), Carter and Kirby the Distinguished Conduct Medal, Stanley the Member of the Order of the British Empire, Buick the Military Medal, Riley was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and Dohle, Roberts, Kendall and Sabben were mentioned in despatches. Both Townsend and Jackson later received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), although these were on the basis of their entire period in command, not solely for actions during the battle. South Vietnamese gallantry medals were also awarded to 22 Australians, but due to official policy regarding foreign awards they were not permitted to wear them until 2004. The limited number of awards later became the subject of considerable criticism.

At the time, the allocation of medals under the Imperial honours system was based on a quota, resulting in many of the original recommendations being downgraded or not awarded, with Smith initially nominated for the DSO, Sabben and Kendall the MC, and Sharp a posthumous mention in despatches. In 2008, a review recommended awards made to three officers be upgraded to the equivalent medals in the modern Australian honours system. Smith was subsequently awarded the Star of Gallantry, and Kendall and Sabben the Medal for Gallantry (MG). Following further review in 2009, Dohle received the Distinguished Service Medal, while D Company, 6 RAR was presented a Unit Citation for Gallantry on 18 August 2011. Another review in 2016 led to awards to ten more soldiers, including Roberts, Alcorta and Lance Corporal Barry Magnussen who received the MG, and Sharp and six others a Commendation for Gallantry.
On 18 August 1969, 6 RAR erected the Long Tan Cross on the battlefield.

===Assessment===

Initial estimates of the VC force ranged from several companies to a battalion, yet following the battle Australian intelligence assessed it as having totalled between 1,500 and 2,500 men, while 1,000 were believed to have directly engaged D Company. The fighting left one-third of D Company killed or wounded. Long Tân proved a local setback for the VC, forestalling movement against Nui Dat. Although there were other large-scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. The battle established the task force&#x27;s dominance over the province, and allowed it to pursue operations to restore government authority. Yet such actions were atypical of the Australian experience, and although 1 ATF invariably inflicted heavy casualties on the VC when encountered in large numbers, they were less important than routine patrolling in separating the guerrillas from the population and maintaining constant pressure, coupled with pacification operations to extend South Vietnamese control. Nonetheless, Long Tân represented a watershed in the campaign, increasing the confidence of the Australians in their ability to defeat the VC and enhancing their military reputation.

The reasons for D Company&#x27;s survival included superior radio communications which had allowed Stanley to co-ordinate the fire of the guns at Nui Dat, the weight of the artillery which repeatedly broke up the assaulting formations, its timely aerial resupply which prevented them running out of ammunition, and the mobility and firepower of the APCs in the relief force which broke the VC&#x27;s will to fight. The battle highlighted the power of modern weapons and the importance of sound small-unit tactics, and has since been cited as an example of the effect of combined arms, demonstrating the effective coordination of infantry, armour, artillery and aviation. Artillery was the mainstay of the defence, with D Company supported by 24 guns of the 1st Field Regiment, RAA and A Battery, US 2/35th Artillery Battalion. Indirect fire provided close protection to the infantry, allowing D Company to hold their line and repulse any VC that succeeded in getting through the barrage. Likely forming-up positions and withdrawal routes had also been heavily engaged throughout the battle. In total 3,198 rounds of 105 mm ammunition were fired by the Australian and New Zealand field guns and 242 rounds of 155 mm high explosive by the Americans. The VC made the error of attacking within range of the artillery at Nui Dat and had to withstand the fire of three field batteries and one medium battery as a result. Long Tân also confirmed the importance of armoured support to infantry, even in dense jungle.

In the wake of the battle the Australians were left to speculate on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the VC had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing an Australian force into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the VC had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. McNeill argues though that too many facts may be missing to make a conclusive assessment of VC intentions and to date no definitive Vietnamese account is available. In the years since the battle the intentions of the VC have been widely discussed, including by both participants and historians, with debate about it continuing until the present. Yet although there remains divided opinion about whether the VC had intended to attack the base at Nui Dat or to ambush an Australian element, according to Coulthard-Clark what is certain was that the force that clashed with D Company, 6 RAR &quot;had been preparing a decisive action against 1 ATF&quot;. The outcome prevented them achieving a politically important victory so soon after the Australian deployment, and &quot;placed Viet Cong plans in the province on the back foot for some time&quot;.

Long-standing disputes include the size of the PAVN/VC attacking force, the number of casualties they suffered, how the battle had unfolded and issues around alleged documentation. Some of the documents assessing casualties or impacts on the PAVN/VC were uncorroborated diaries and anecdotal evidence from &quot;Chinese Generals&quot;. There were also issues with the size of the attacking PAVN/VC forces and communist dead by several authors and by the &quot;Red Dunes Film Group&quot;, which has received criticism from an Australian Vietnam War veteran and later historian and Vietnamese-language linguist Ernie Chamberlain. In 2015, Harry Smith published &quot;Long Tan, The Start of a Lifelong Battle&quot; in which he accused senior officers including Jackson and Townsend of fabricating claims about the battle, and alleged that the official history was disingenuous and self-serving. This included deliberate inflation of communist dead by Army Spokesmen and others, and embellishing the roles of officers at the battle at the expense of their men.

===Lessons learned by the Australians===
After Long Tân a rifle company with armoured support was dedicated to provide a rapid reaction force, on standby to respond to an attack or exploit any opportunity. The VC had been armed with weapons at least equal to those used by the Australians. Most had carried modern Soviet assault rifles, as well as a large quantity of ammunition, which allowed them to sustain a high rate of fire. In contrast, the amount of ammunition carried by the Australians had been insufficient, and following the battle the minimum load was increased to 140 rounds per rifle and 500 for each machine-gun. The aerial resupply of D Company had been delayed because no prepacked ammunition was available. This also changed, with rounds loaded in magazines for quick use. The VC had used 60 mm mortars, but they were no longer standard equipment for Australian rifle companies, and although battalions were issued 81 mm mortars they were controlled by Support Company. Such weapons would afford integral fire support in situations where their opponents had closed within the safety distance of the artillery, and consideration was given to their re-issue. Yet the added weight would limit the ability of sub-units to patrol and M-79 grenade launchers were issued instead, while some APCs were modified as mortar carriers.

Despite detecting a transmitter from the 275th Regiment moving west towards Nui Dat, such intercepts were unable to predict VC intentions with certainty, and patrols through the area also failed to find it. Jackson had responded by maintaining patrols at company strength when outside Line Alpha, while ensuring a level of base security. Townsend had not been given access to this intelligence and some officers were later critical of the restrictions placed on it. Although it would not have altered the requirement for a company-sized patrol it might have changed the way the battle was fought, and afterwards both battalion commanders were regularly briefed on such intercepts. The value of patrolling in depth and in sufficient strength to prevent the VC concentrating their forces had been reinforced, and while there was no change to the pattern of Australian operations, when a significant engagement was possible patrols would be a minimum of a company and would operate close enough to rapidly support each other to stop them becoming isolated. Lastly, the command relationship between the infantry and APCs had been problematic during the battle and changes to standard operating procedures were implemented to provide clearer direction in such circumstances.

===Subsequent operations===
A week following the battle US II FFV launched a large-scale corps-sized sweep of Phước Tuy on 23 August. Operation Toledo saw the deployment of two brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, and two ARVN Ranger battalions in an attempt to destroy the 274th and 275th Regiments. 1 ATF involvement included both 5 and 6 RAR and supporting units. It lasted until 8 September and despite the intensity of the previous fighting little contact occurred, with no evidence of a large force having been in the area uncovered. Poorly planned, it failed to trap the VC, while 5 RAR&#x27;s involvement resulted in only two VC killed, one wounded and one captured without loss, although several tunnels were discovered in Long Tân village and destroyed.
In the months that followed 1 ATF conducted further search and destroy, village cordon and search and route security operations to extend its control and to separate the local people from the influence of the VC. Such operations usually resulted in contacts between the Australians and small groups of VC, while during cordon and search operations of Bình Ba and Hòa Long a number of villagers suspected of sympathising with the VC were apprehended and handed over to the South Vietnamese authorities. Several search operations were also conducted in areas suspected of containing VC base camps, and these often resulted in the discovery of recently used and quickly evacuated camps, hospitals and logistic bases which were then destroyed. Meanwhile, 1 ATF continued an extensive patrolling and ambushing program around Nui Dat.

==50th anniversary==

Commemorated in Australia ever since, in time the battle became part of the legend of its involvement in the war. The best known of the Australian Army&#x27;s actions in Vietnam, it has assumed a similar significance as battles such as Gallipoli, Kokoda and Kapyong. The date it was fought is observed annually as Long Tan Day and is also known as Vietnam Veterans&#x27; Remembrance Day, the national day of commemoration of the Vietnam War.

For the 50th anniversary of the battle the Vietnamese government permitted Australians to hold a &#x27;low-key ceremony&#x27;, but the unexpected booking of 3,500 individuals to attend as well as a concert by Little Pattie led to the Vietnamese government cancelling the event. Following late-night talks by Malcolm Turnbull with the prime minister of Vietnam, a low-key ceremony was once again permitted. On 18 August 2016 a ceremony was held on the battlefield; more than 1,000 Australian veterans and their families travelled to Vietnam to participate in the 50th anniversary commemoration.

In Australia hundreds attended the Australian War Memorial and Vietnam Forces National Memorial in Canberra. Commemorations were also held at Sydney&#x27;s Cenotaph, Brisbane&#x27;s ANZAC Square, Melbourne&#x27;s Shrine of Remembrance and elsewhere. The events in Canberra included a four-gun salute and flyover by Vietnam-era aircraft, including Iroquois helicopters, Hercules and Caribou transports and two B-52 bombers. A Last Post Ceremony was held at the War Memorial, with a reading by Victoria Cross-recipient Mark Donaldson. In 2017, Turnbull negotiated for the repatriation of the original Long Tan cross, and the Prime Minister of Vietnam donated it to the Australian government on conditions of no publicity surrounding the transfer. The original cross was installed at the Australian War Memorial following the transfer.

<text>No. 460 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force intelligence unit active within the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO). It was first formed as a heavy bomber squadron during World War II on 15 November 1941 and disbanded on 10 October 1945 after seeing extensive combat over Europe. The squadron was a multinational unit, but most personnel were Australian. No. 460 Squadron was reformed on 2 July 2010 and is currently located in Canberra.

==History==
===World War II===

No. 460 Squadron RAAF was formed from &#x27;C&#x27; Flight of No. 458 Squadron RAAF at RAF Molesworth, Huntingdonshire on 15 November 1941, as a bomber squadron equipped with Wellington Mk.IV aircraft. Originally part of No. 8 Group RAF, Bomber Command, the squadron moved to RAF Breighton, Yorkshire and joined No. 1 Group RAF. The squadron made its first raid, against the German city of Emden, on 12 March 1942. The following night, five crews from the squadron participated in a raid on harbour facilities around Dunkirk, during which the squadron suffered its first losses of the war when one Wellington was shot down. A six-week &quot;apprenticeship&quot; period followed until the end of April 1942, during which the squadron was assigned mainly to attack less heavily defended targets on the French Channel coast; nevertheless, the squadron also undertook several attacks against targets in Germany during this time also. The squadron&#x27;s first three months of operations saw it carry out 34 raids. For each raid, at least two aircraft were contributed, with some raids seeing as many as 10 aircraft taking part; a 30 May 1942 raid on Cologne saw 18 aircraft from No. 460 Squadron assigned. A total of six crews were lost during these raids.

Losses between June and August amounted to 20 aircraft, and at the end of the period the squadron began to convert to Halifax Mk.IIs, but in October the squadron was re-equipped with Lancaster Mks. I and III. The following May, No. 460 Squadron relocated to RAF Binbrook, Lincolnshire, from where it participated in the strategic bombing of Germany.

In late 1943 and early 1944, the squadron flew sorties in the Battle of Berlin. During the spring and summer of 1944, the squadron flew many missions in support of the D-Day landings. Its final raid was an attack on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s mountain retreat of Berchtesgaden on Anzac Day, 1945. In May, No. 460 Squadron joined Operation Manna, the transportation of relief supplies to starving Dutch civilians. The squadron moved to RAF East Kirkby, Lincolnshire, in preparation for re-location to the Pacific theatre, as part of a proposed Commonwealth strategic air force known as Tiger Force, for the invasion of Japan. The move became unnecessary following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and No. 460 Squadron disbanded on 10 October 1945.

The squadron flew the most sorties of any Australian bomber squadron and dropped more bomb tonnage than any squadron in the whole of Bomber Command—24,856 tons, which it dropped over 6,262 sorties. In doing that it lost 188 aircraft and suffered 1,018 combat deaths (589 of whom were Australian). This was the most of any Australian squadron during the war, with No. 460 Squadron effectively wiped out five times over its existence. RAF Bomber Command represented only two percent of total Australian enlistments during World War II, but accounted for almost 20 percent of personnel killed in action. Total Bomber Command losses were 55,573 for all nationalities.

No. 460 Squadron is commemorated at the Australian War Memorial by a display featuring its only surviving aircraft, G for George. This aircraft made 90 operational sorties between late 1942 and mid-1944. There is a memorial to the squadron on the site of the former RAF Binbrook, in Lincolnshire, UK, consisting of a plaque, trees and various memorial benches. There are also memorials in a number of other countries including Denmark, France, the Netherlands (Grafhorst) and Germany, marking the sites of where squadron aircraft crashed or individual crew members were killed.

===Current role===

On 1 April 2010, then Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Mark Binskin announced that No. 460 Squadron was to be reformed as a non-flying squadron within the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO). The squadron was subsequently re-established on 2 July at a ceremony held in front of G for George at the Australian War Memorial.

No. 460 Squadron is currently located in Canberra. Its roles include analysing photos and other imagery to help plan strike missions.

<text>Maluku is a province of Indonesia. It comprises the central and southern regions of the Maluku Islands. The largest city and capital of Maluku province is Ambon on the small Ambon Island. It is directly adjacent to North Maluku, Southwest Papua, and West Papua in the north, Central Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi in the west, Banda Sea, Australia, East Timor and East Nusa Tenggara in the south and Arafura Sea, Central Papua and South Papua in the east. The land area is 57803.81 km2, and the total population of this province at the 2010 census was 1,533,506 people, rising to 1,848,923 at the 2020 census, the official estimate as at mid 2023 (actually, the sum of the official mid-year estimates for all the cities and regencies) was 1,908,753. Maluku is located in Eastern Indonesia.

Maluku has two main religions, namely Islam which at the 2020 census was adhered to by 52.85% of the population of the province and Christianity which is embraced by 46.3% (39.4% Protestantism and 7.0% Catholicism).

All the Maluku Islands were part of a single province from 1950 until 1999. In 1999, the northern part of Maluku (then comprising the Maluku Utara Regency, the Halmahera Tengah Regency and the City of Ternate) were split off to form a separate province of North Maluku (), separated from the remaining (South) Maluku Province by the Seram Sea.

== Etymology ==
Historically, the term Maluku referred to the four royal centers in North Maluku, namely Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. A type of confederation consisting of the four kingdoms, which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or &quot;The Four Mountains of Maluku&quot;. Although the four kingdoms subsequently expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (as now defined) and parts of Sulawesi and New Guinea, the area of expansion was originally not included in the term Maluku. This only referred to the four main clove-producing islands to the west of Halmahera: Ternate, Tidore. Moti and Makian. Bacan further to the south, and Jailolo on Halmahera, were also commonly included in Maluku Proper, the four kingdoms forming a ritual quadripartition with connotations to local cosmology.

The etymology of the word &quot;Maluku&quot; is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts. The first recorded word that can be identified with &quot;Maluku&quot; comes from Nagarakretagama, an Old Javanese eulogy of 1365. Canto 14 stanza 5 mentioned &quot;Maloko&quot;, which Pigeaud identified with Ternate or Moluccas. A theory holds that the name Maluku comes from the concept of &quot;Maluku Kie Raha&quot;. &quot;Raha&quot; means four, while &quot;kie&quot; here means mountain, referring to 4 mountains of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, and Jailolo (Halmahera), which have their own kolano (title for local kings). Therefore, the Maluku can come from: &quot;Moloku&quot; here meaning to grasp or hold. In this context, the meaning of &quot;Moloku Kie Raha&quot; is &quot;the confederation of four mountains&quot;. However, the root word &quot;loku&quot; comes from local Malay creole word for a unit, therefore not from an indigenous language. The other possibility is that the word &quot;Maloko&quot; is a combination of &quot;Ma&quot;, meaning &quot;support&quot; and &quot;Loko&quot; referring to the area. The phrase &quot;Maloko Kie Raha&quot; means &quot;the place/world which has four mountains&quot;.

== History ==
=== Pre-colonial era ===
The region was first settled by Melanesians at least 40,000 years ago, collectively now known as the Alifuru tribes.These people are the indigenous inhabitants of Maluku, along with the later Austronesian migration.

At the beginning of the 14th century the Majapahit Kingdom ruled maritime Southeast Asia. At that time, traders from Java monopolized the spice trade in Maluku.

During the Ming dynasty, spices from Maluku were introduced in various works of art and history. In a painting by W.P. Groeneveldt, titled Gunung Dupa, Maluku, is described as a green mountainous region filled with cloves – an oasis in the middle of the southeastern sea. Marco Polo also described the clove trade in Maluku during his visit to Sumatra.

Before the arrival of European colonials, the Maluku islands had been ruled by several sultanates that played an important role in the spice trade, especially cloves and nutmeg. In the Maluku region, four major sultanates – Ternate, Tidore, Jailolo, and Bacan – formed a power structure known as the “&quot;Moloku Kie Raha&quot;,” or “Four Mountains of Maluku.” The four had dynamic relationships, both alliances and rivalries, that played a vital role in maintaining stability and prosperity in the region, especially through the valuable spice trade.

The Sultanate of Ternate was one of the most influential sultanates in Maluku and played an important role in the clove trade that connected Maluku with traders from Asia and the Middle East. Founded around the 13th century, Ternate developed into a center of maritime power and the spread of Islam in the eastern part of the archipelago. This sultanate established strong diplomatic relations with major kingdoms in Southeast Asia, such as the Sultanate of Malacca and the Majapahit Kingdom, strengthening its position in international trade routes. Under the rule of famous sultans such as Sultan Baabullah, Ternate was even able to expel the Portuguese and maintain its sovereignty, which made it a symbol of strength and independence in Maluku.

The Sultanate of Tidore, which grew in almost the same period, also played an important role in Maluku. Like Ternate, Tidore developed a formidable maritime power and had extensive diplomatic relations, including with areas in the Southern Philippines. Tidore had a strong military tradition and often formed alliances with kingdoms in the northern region to face external threats, especially from European powers such as Portugal and Spain. Under the rule of Sultan Nuku, Tidore built local alliances and waged resistance that succeeded in maintaining its sovereignty while maintaining control over the spice trade.

Meanwhile, the Jailolo Sultanate and the Bacan Sultanate also played a significant role in maintaining political and social balance in Maluku. Sultanate of Jailolo, as one of the oldest sultanates, has a very rich cultural tradition and is a spiritual and cultural center that is respected among the people of Maluku. During its heyday, Jailolo became a respected local power, with influence not only on political aspects but also social and cultural aspects. The Sultanate of Bacan, although not as large as Ternate and Tidore, had a strategic role in trade routes and became an important supporter of the two sultanates, strengthening the defense system and relations with communities in the southern region.

These four sultanates, through the &quot;Moloku Kie Raha&quot; system, demonstrated a bond of unity in the face of external threats and in managing the economic and cultural potential of Maluku. Although Ternate and Tidore often stand out in the role of trade and resistance to foreign powers, Jailolo and Bacan remain an important part of this structure, both as a balancing force and as a symbol of Maluku&#x27;s cultural diversity. Their cooperation and competition illustrate the complexity of local politics that helped maintain Maluku&#x27;s identity and sovereignty for centuries, making this region a unique center of the spice trade in the world.

The era of the sultanate began to change drastically with the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century, followed by the Spanish, Dutch, and then the British. European penetration in the region led to the weakening of local power and major changes in the political and economic structure of Maluku.

=== Colonial era ===
The first Europeans to arrive in Maluku were the Portuguese, in 1512. At that time two Portuguese fleets, under the leadership of António de Abreu and Francisco Serrão, landed in the Banda Islands and the Penyu Islands. After they established relations with local residents and kings, such as the Sultanate of Ternate on the island of Ternate, the Portuguese were given permission to build fortifications in Pikaoli, as well as the old Hitu State, and Mamala on Ambon Island. The Portuguese gained a monopoly while at the same time carrying out the spread of Catholicism.

One of the famous missionaries was Francis Xavier. Arriving in Ambon on February 14, 1546, then traveling to Ternate, arriving in 1547, visiting islands in the Maluku Islands to spread Catholicism.

The relationship between the Portuguese and Ternatean broke down in 1570, resulting in a war with Sultan Babullah that lasted for 5 years (1570–1575), causing the Portuguese to be expelled from Ternate and were driven to Tidore and Ambon.

The resistance of the Moluccas to the Portuguese was used by the Dutch to gain a foothold in Maluku. In 1605, the Dutch managed to force the Portuguese to surrender their defenses in Ambon to Steven van der Hagen and at Tidore to the Sebastiansz Cornelisz. Similarly, the British fortress in Kambelo, Seram Island, was destroyed by the Dutch. Giving the Dutch control of most of the Maluku region.

The Dutch position in Maluku grew stronger with the establishment of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602, and since then the Netherlands has become the sole ruler in Maluku. Under the leadership of Jan Pieterszoon Coen, Chief of Operations of the VOC, the clove trade in Maluku was under VOC control for almost 350 years. For this purpose, the VOC did not hesitate to expel the Portuguese, Spanish and the British. Tens of thousands of Moluccans were victims of VOC brutality.

During the Napoleonic Wars, British forces captured Maluku as the Netherlands were under French occupation. After the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, the British returned Maluku to the Dutch. The Dutch returned in 1817.

The return of the Dutch in 1817 evoked strong resistance from the Moluccans. This was due to political, economic and social relations conditions that had been bad for two centuries. Moluccan people of the Ambon Islands rose up and took up arms under the leadership of Thomas Matulessy who was given the title Kapitan Pattimura, a former major sergeant of the British army.

On May 15, 1817, an attack was launched against Fort Duurstede on Saparua island, resulting in the death of Resident Johannes Rudolph van den Berg and his family. Pattimura was assisted by Philip Latumahina, Anthony Ribok, and Said Orders.

The news of this Pattimura&#x27;s victory aroused the spirit of popular resistance throughout Maluku. Paulus Tiahahu and his daughter Martha Christina Tiahahu fought the Dutch on Nusa Laut, and Kapitan Ulupaha in Ambon.

But this resistance was crushed by the Dutch, being heavily outnumbered. On December 16, 1817, Pattimura and his colleagues were sentenced to death on the gallows, at Fort Niew Victoria, Ambon, while Martha Christina Tiahahu died on the boat during her voyage to Java and her body was released into the Banda Sea.

=== Modern era ===

Following the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, as part of World War II the region was occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese attacked on 31 January 1942, landing at Hutu beach on the north coast, and Ritung beach in the south. They were opposed by soldiers of the KNIL and a small Australian contingent. The KNIL commander was captured the day after the attack, and the last defenders of the airfield were overcome a few days later. The battle was followed by the summary execution of more than 300 Allied PoWs in the Laha massacre.

On August 15, 1945, Japan capitulated to the Allied forces. Two days later, the Proclamation of Independence of Indonesia was declared. Maluku was declared as one of the provinces of the Republic of Indonesia. However, the formation and position of Maluku was forced to take place in Jakarta, as after the Japanese surrender, the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) immediately re-entered Maluku to assume control. The Dutch controlled Maluku until 1949, when in accordance to the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, the Dutch recognize sovereignty of Indonesia. The Dutch soon left Maluku. Due to a deep distrust of the Indonesian leadership, which was predominantly Javanese Muslim, in 1951 an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (Indonesian: RMS, Republik Maluku Selatan) was proclaimed at Ambon. The RMS had strong support among the former Moluccans colonial soldiers. Indonesian forces invaded Maluku to crush the separatists. The main stronghold of the RMS on Ambon was defeated by Indonesian forces in November 1950, while a smaller scale guerilla struggle continued on Seram Island until 1962. The defeat on Ambon however resulted in the flight of the self-declared RMS government from the islands, and the formation of a government in exile in the Netherlands. The following year some 12,000 Moluccan soldiers accompanied by their families went to the Netherlands.

In April and May 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the United States supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a Taiwan-based CIA front organisation, Civil Air Transport, flying CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly raided targets on Ambon. From April 27 until 18 May there were CIA air raids on Ambon city. On May 8, 1958, CIA pilot Allen Pope raided the Indonesian Air Force base at Liang in the northeast of the island, damaging the runway and destroying a Consolidated PBY Catalina. The Indonesian Air Force had only one serviceable fighter aircraft on Ambon Island, a North American P-51 Mustang at Liang. Pope&#x27;s last air raid was on 18 May, when an Indonesian pilot at Liang, Captain Ignatius Dewanto, was scrambled to the P-51. Pope had attacked Ambon city before Dewanto could catch him, but Dewanto intercepted him just as Pope was attacking a pair of troop ships in an Indonesian fleet west of Ambon Island. The B-26 was brought down by fire from both Dewanto and anti-aircraft gunners on board the ship. Pope and his Indonesian radio operator bailed and were captured, which immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from the conflict.

The Maluku sectarian conflict broke out across Maluku in January 1999. The subsequent 18 months were characterized by fighting between largely local groups of Muslims and Christians, the destruction of thousands of houses, the displacement of approximately 500,000 people, the loss of thousands of lives, and the segregation of Muslims and Christians. Inter-communal fighting broke out between Christian and Muslim communities in January 1999, cascading into what could be described as all out warfare and atrocities against the civilian population committed by both sides. The main belligerents were therefore religious militia from both faiths, including the well organised Islamist Laskar Jihad, and Indonesian government military forces. The conflict had a significant effect upon the 2.1 million people of greater Maluku. Leading up to the Malino agreement, the International Crisis Group estimated that 700,000 people had been displaced by the four years of fighting in the Moluccas which is thought to have claimed a minimum of 5,000 lives. This constituted the largest movement of refugees since the federation of the Indonesian state and the majority of the 1.4 million Internal refugees reported in February 2002 by the World Food Programme. The duration of the conflict is generally dated from the start of the Reformasi era in early 1999 to the signing of the Malino II Accord on February 13, 2002.

==Geography==
Maluku is bordered by North Maluku in the north, West Papua in the East, Southeast Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi in the West, and the nation of Timor-Leste and Australia in the south. While the total area consists of 527,191 km2 of sea area, and 57,803.81 km2 of land area, or in other words around 90% of Maluku is sea area. As an archipelago province, Maluku has 559 islands, which include some relatively large islands: Seram (18,625 km2), Buru (9,000 km2) Yamdena (5,085 km2) and Wetar (3,624 km2).

Most of the province&#x27;s islands lie along two mainly submerged oceanic ridges which form the eastwards extension of the Lesser Sunda Islands; the inner arc runs from Wetar Island through the Romang Islands and Damar Island (with its northeasterly outliers) to end at the Banda Islands; the outer arc extends from the Wetar Strait through Kisar Island, the Letti Islands, the Sermata Islands, the Babar Islands, the Tanimbar Islands, the Kei Islands (more precisely, the Kur Island group in the west of the Kei Islands), the Watubela Islands and the Gorong Islands, ending with Seram Island and Buru Island. With the dominant condition of regional waters, Maluku is very open to interacting with other provinces and surrounding countries.

The Maluku islands have a tropical monsoon climate, this climate is greatly influenced by the presence of vast marine waters and takes place in tune with the climatic season there. The average temperature based on Meteorological stations in Ambon, Tual and Saumlaki are C 26.80, 27.70 C and 27.40 C. Minimum temperatures are 24.00, 24.70 C and 23.80 C, respectively, while the temperature Tual, the average humidity reaches 85.4% when recording Saumlaki Meteorological Station shows the average humidity is 80.2%.

The topography of the average condition of the Ambon region is rather flat, starting from the coast to residential areas. The mainland morphology of Ambon also varies from flat, bumpy, bumpy, hilly and mountainous with soft steep slopes to slightly dominant. The flat area has a slope of 0–3%, corrugated slope 3–8%, corrugated area 8–15%, hilly area 15–30% slope elevation and mountainous area greater than 30%. As for the Central Maluku Regency, West Seram and East Seram, the topography is generally hilly. 0–2%, tilt / wavy 3–15% rather steep 15–40% and very steep 40%.

Topography in the Southeast Maluku Regency is divided into plains, hills and mountains with flat slopes (0–3%), flat / bumpy (3–8%), bumpy (8–15%), rather steep (15–30%) and very steep (&gt; 50%). The height of the sea surface area is divided into three classes, namely in the low altitude area (000–100 m elevation), middle (100–500 m), and high altitude (&gt; 500 m).

The topography of Buru Regency is mostly hilly and mountainous with a slope of 15–40% and 40%, the remaining height is from ordinary varieties. The highest mountain peak is located in the Kapalamada region north west of Buru with an altitude of 2736 meters above sea level (ASL), after Lake Rana with a height of more than 1000 meters above sea level, Lake Rana is estimated at around 700–750 meters above sea level. Using a landscape approach, Buru district is classified above, the coastal hills of the plains and mountains include varieties of highlands and slopes.

=== List of major islands and groups in Maluku Province ===
*Ambon Island
*Aru Islands (Kepulauan Aru)
*Banda Islands (Kepulauan Banda)
*Buru Island, including offshore Ambelau Island
*Kai Islands (Kepulauan Kai)
*Gorong archipelago (Pulau-pulau Gorong)
*Lease Islands (&quot;Kepulauan Lease&quot;) includes Saparua, Nusa Laut and Haruku Islands
*Seram (the largest island) includes islands off its coasts, particularly Manipa, Kelong and Boana Islands to the west

*Tanimbar Islands (Kepulauan Tanimbar)
*Watubela archipelago (Kepulauan Watubela)

==Government and administrative divisions==
Following the splitting off of the northern parts of the regency in 1999 to form the new North Maluku Province (&quot;Maluku Utara&quot;), the residual province of Maluku was composed of two regencies (Central Maluku and Southeast Maluku) and the City of Ambon, but on 4 October 1999 two new regencies were created with the separation of Buru Regency from Central Maluku, and of Southeast Maluku West Regency from Southeast Maluku. Three additional regencies were created on 18 December 2003 (under Law 40/2003) - East Seram Regency and West Seram Regency, both from parts of Central Maluku, and Aru Islands Regency from part of Southeast Maluku (which was thus left to comprise just the Kai Islands. On 17 July 2007 the City of Tual was separated from Southeast Maluku, and on 24 June 2008 two further regencies were created - South Buru Regency from part of Buru, and Southwest Maluku Regency from part of Southeast Maluku West. The residual part of Southeast Maluku West Regency was subsequently renamed the Tanimbar Islands Regency on 23 January 2019.

Thus the province of Maluku is currently divided into nine regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and the two cities (&quot;kota&quot;) of Ambon and Tual, which form the tenth and eleventh regency-level administrative divisions. The regencies and cities, with their administrative capitals, are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and at the 2020 census, together with the official estimates for mid 2023. The table also includes the numbers of districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) and villages (urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; and rural &quot;desa&quot;) in each city or regency.

The province forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Maluku Electoral District consists of all of the 9 regencies and 2 cities in the province, and elects 4 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Demographics ==
=== Ethnicity ===
Since ancient times, many of the Maluku people already had mixed blood with other ethnic groups, namely with Chinese, Indians, Persians, Europeans (generally the Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish), then the Arabs were very common considering this area had been settled by foreign nations for 2,300 years and gave birth to new descendants, which is no longer a pure Melanesian race but still inherits and lives with the Melanesian-Alifuru style.

Because of this mixture of culture and race with Chinese, Indians, Persians, Europeans and Arabs, Maluku is the only Indonesian territory that is classified as an area that has the largest multiracial population other than East Nusa Tenggara. Many Moluccans still retained foreign surnames from foreign countries such as the Netherlands (Van Afflen, Van Room, De Wanna, De Kock, Kniesmeijer, Gaspersz, Ramschie, Payer, Ziljstra, Van der Weden, etc.), Portugal (Da Costa, De Fretes, Que, Carliano, De Souza, De Carvalho, Pareira, Courbois, Frandescolli, etc.), Spain (Oliviera, Diaz, De Jesus, Silvera, Rodriguez, Montefalcon, Mendoza, De Lopez, etc.) and Hadhramaut in Yemen (Al-Kaff, Al Chatib, Bachmid, Bakhwereez, Bahasoan, Al-Qadri, Alaydrus, Assegaff, etc.)

Today, the people of Maluku are not only found in Indonesia but are spread in various countries in the world. Most of those who migrate abroad are due to various reasons, of which the most classic was the large-scale movement of the Moluccans to Europe in the 1950s and settled there until now. Another reason is to get a better, more knowledgeable life, marrying other ethnicities, who later settle down and have generations of new Moluccans abroad. These Maluku expatriates can be found in quite large communities and are concentrated in several countries such as the Netherlands (which is considered the second homeland by the Moluccas other than the land of Maluku itself), Suriname, Australia, and the United States. The Maluku community in other regions of Indonesia can be found in Medan, Palembang, Bandung, Greater Jakarta, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, Makassar, Kupang, Manado, East Kalimantan, Sorong, and Jayapura.

=== Language ===
The languages used in Maluku, especially in Ambon, has been influenced by foreign languages, often by explorers who have visited and even occupied and colonized Maluku in the past. The nations were the Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Dutch.

The Ambonese language, as the lingua franca in Maluku, has been understood by almost all residents of Maluku Province and generally, little by little, is understood by other East Indonesian people such as those in Ternate, Manado, Kupang, etc. because Ambonese is related to other languages in the provinces of North Sulawesi, North Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara and the six provinces of Indonesian Papua.

Indonesian, as the official language and language of unity in the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI), is used in official and formal public activities such as in government offices and in schools and in places such as museums, airports and ports.

Maluku is the largest archipelago in all of Indonesia, although this area is 90% water and only 10% land. Maluku Province and North Maluku Province together compose the Maluku Islands. The large number of islands that are separated by long distances from each other also results in the increasingly diverse languages used in this province. Some of the most common languages spoken in Maluku - apart from Ambonese and Indonesian - are:

* Wemale language, used by residents of Piru, Seruawan, Kamarian, and Rumberu in the West Seram Regency.
* Alune language is used in three water streams, namely Tala, Mala and Malewa in the West Seram Regency area.
* Nuaulu language, spoken by the Nuaulu tribe in the south of Seram Island, is between Elpaputih Bay and Teluk Telutih.
* Atiahu language, used by three ethnic groups, which also included the Nuaulu family, namely Atiahu, Werinama, and Batuasa in the East Seram Regency.
* Seti language is spoken by the Seti people, in North Seram and East Teluti, and also as a trade language in Eastern Seram.
* Tarangan language, spoken in the Aru Island region.

=== Religion ===

Most of the people of Maluku adheres to either Islam, (52.85% of the population) or Christianity (46.3% of the population); the latter are divided between followers of (Protestantism (39.39%) and Catholicism (6.87%). There are also adherents of folk religion, Hinduism and Buddhism. The spread of Islam was carried out by the Sultanates of Iha, Saulau, Hitu, and Hatuhaha and Arab traders who visited Maluku. While the spread of Christianity was carried out by missionaries from Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.

Places of worship in Maluku Province in 2013 were recorded as follows:

* 2,345 churches
* 2,000 mosques
* 10 temples
* 5 Vihara

The Protestant Church of Maluku (Gereja Protestan Maluku or simply GPM) is the largest synod organization and church organization in Maluku, which has church congregations in almost the entire Sarane country throughout Maluku.

==Economy==
Macroeconomically, Maluku&#x27;s economic conditions tend to improve every year. One indicator is, among others, an increase in the value of GDP. In 2003 Maluku&#x27;s GRDP reached 3.7 trillion rupiah and then increased to 4.05 trillion in 2004. Economic growth in 2004 reached 4.05 percent and increased to 5.06 percent in 2005.

The geographical condition of Maluku Province when viewed from the strategic side of business investment opportunities can be predicted that natural resources in the fisheries and marine sector can be used as prima donna businesses in Maluku, in addition to other sectors such as livestock and plantation subsector, trade sector and tourism sector as well as the service sector entirely has a high selling value and business potential.

Currently the economy of Maluku is dominated by agriculture, forestry and fisheries that contribute to about 25.00 percent of the total.
Government service sector, defence and compulsory Social Security contribute to roughly 21 percent. The business field and retail trade; cars and motorcycles repair &amp; services at 12.59 percent; construction sector contributes 7.41 percent.
Maluku&#x27;s economy in 2014 has shown positive improvement as compared to 2013. The GDP growth rate in 2014 reached 6.70 percent, while in 2013 amounted to 5.26 percent. The highest economic growth is in the field of electricity and gas supply business which grew by 31.11 percent. The business service is another sector that experienced positive growth in 2014.
Other economic activities also recorded positive growth, including mining and quarrying (21.47 percent); education services business field (9.52 percent); transportation and warehousing business sector (8.77 percent); processing industry (8.42 percent); information and communication (7.62 per cent); financial services business (7.61 percent); construction (7.31 percent); real estate (7.10 percent).

In 2017, a Japanese oil company, Inpex Corporation acquired Abadi Field, a crude oil and natural gas field located in the Arafura Sea, near Tanimbar Islands. In 2017 the company to start the Pre FEED phase and hold a joint workshop with SKK Migas to prepare an offshore development plan for project of Block Masela.

==Culture==
=== Music ===
The famous musical instruments are Tifa (a type of drum) and Totobuang, played together in an ensemble called a Tifa totobuang. Each musical instrument from Tifa to Totobuang has different functions and supports each other to give birth to a very distinctive color of music. But this music is dominated by Tifa musical instruments. It consists of Tifa, Tifa Jekir, Tifa Dasar, Tifa Potong, Tifa Jekir Potong and Tifa Bas, plus a large Gong and Toto Buang which is a series of small gongs placed on a table with several holes as a buffer. There is also a wind instrument namely Bia Skin (Shellfish).

In the culture of Maluku, there are also stringed instruments namely Ukulele and that can also be found in the Hawaiian culture in the United States. This can be seen when Maluku music from the past until now still has a characteristic in which there is the use of Hawaiian musical instruments both in pop songs and in accompanying traditional dances such as Katreji.

Other musical instruments is the Sawat. Sawat is a blend of Maluku culture and Middle Eastern culture. In a few centuries ago, the Arabs came to spread Islam in Maluku, then there was a mixture of cultures including music. It is evident in several Sawat musical instruments, such as Tambourines and Flutes that characterize Arabian music instruments.

Outside of the variety of musical instruments, Moluccan people are famous for being good at singing. Since long ago they have often sung in accompanying traditional dances. There are many famous Moluccan singers in both Indonesia and the Netherlands, such as Broery Pesulima, Daniel Sahuleka, Ruth Sahanaya, Eric Papilaya, Glen Fredly, etc.

=== Dance ===

The famous dance from the Moluccas is the Cakalele which describes the might of the Moluccas. This dance is usually performed by adult men while holding Parang and Salawaku (Shield).

There are also other dances like Saureka-Reka that use the sago palm fronds. The dances performed by six women really need accuracy and speed while accompanied by a very interesting musical rhythm.

The dance which is a depiction of youth association is Katreji. Katreji dance is played in pairs between women and men with varied energetic and interesting movements. This dance is almost the same as European dances in general because Katreji is also an acculturation of European (Portuguese and Dutch) culture with Maluku culture. This is more evident in every signal in changing floor patterns and movements which still use Portuguese and Dutch as a process of bilingualism. This dance is accompanied by a violin instrument, bamboo flute, ukulele, karakas, guitar, tifa, and bass guitar with a more prominent western (European) musical pattern. This dance is still performed by the people of Maluku until now.

In addition to Katreji, the famous European influence is Polonaise, which is usually carried out by Moluccans at the time of marriage by each party member in pairs, forming a circle formation and carrying out light movements that can be followed by everyone, both young and old.

In addition, there is also a Crazy Bamboo Dance. Crazy bamboo dance is a special dance that is magical, originating from Suli Village. The uniqueness of this dance is that the dancers are burdened by bamboo which can move uncontrollably and this dance can be followed by anyone.

<text>Krome Studios Melbourne, originally Beam Software, was an Australian video game development studio founded in 1980 by Alfred Milgrom and Naomi Besen and based in Melbourne, Australia. Initially formed to produce books and software to be published by Melbourne House, a company they had established in London in 1977, the studio operated independently from 1987 until 1999, when it was acquired by Infogrames, who changed the name to Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd.. In 2006 the studio was sold to Krome Studios.

The name Beam was a contraction of the names of the founders: Naomi Besen and Alfred Milgrom.

== History ==
=== Home computer era ===
In the early years, two of Beam&#x27;s programs were milestones in their respective genres. &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a 1982 text adventure by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler, sold more than 500,000 copies. It employed an advanced parser by Stuart Richie and had real-time elements. Even if the player didn&#x27;t enter commands, the story would move on. In 1985 Greg Barnett&#x27;s two-player martial arts game &quot;The Way of the Exploding Fist&quot; helped define the genre of one-on-one fighting games on the home computer. The game won Best Overall Game at the Golden Joystick Awards.

In 1987 Beam&#x27;s UK publishing arm, Melbourne House, was sold to Mastertronic for £850,000. Beam chairman Alfred Milgrom recounted, &quot;...around 1987 a lot of our U.K. people went on to other companies and at around the same time the industry was moving from 8-bit to 16-bit. It was pretty chaotic. We didn&#x27;t have the management depth at that time to run both the publishing and development sides of things, so we ended up selling off the whole Melbourne House publishing side to Mastertronic.&quot; Subsequent games were released through varying publishers. The 1988 fighting games &quot;Samurai Warrior&quot; and &quot;Fist +&quot;, the third instalment in the Exploding Fist series, were published through Telecomsoft&#x27;s Firebird label. 1988 also saw the release of space-shoot&#x27;em-up &quot;Bedlam&quot;, published by GO!, one of U.S. Gold&#x27;s labels, and &quot;The Muncher&quot;, published by Gremlin Graphics.

=== Shift to consoles and PCs ===
In 1987 Nintendo granted a developer&#x27;s licence for the NES and Beam developed games on that platform for US and Japanese publishers. Targeted at an Australian audience, releases such as &quot;Aussie Rules Footy&quot; and &quot;International Cricket&quot; for the NES proved successful. In 1992 they released the original title &quot;Nightshade&quot;, a dark superhero comedy game. The game was meant to be the first part in a series, but no sequels were ever made; however, it served as the basis for &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. Released in 1993, &quot;Shadowrun&quot; also used an innovative dialogue system using the acquisition of keywords which could be used in subsequent conversations to initiate new branches in the dialogue tree. Also in 1993 they released &quot;Baby T-Rex&quot;, a Game Boy platform game that the developer actively sought to adapt the game to a number of different licensed properties in different countries around the world including the animated film &quot;We&#x27;re Back!&quot; in North America and the puppet character Agro in their home country of Australia.

In 1997, Beam relaunched the Melbourne House brand, under which they published the PC titles &quot;Krush Kill &#x27;n&#x27; Destroy&quot; (KKND), and the sequels &quot;KKND Xtreme&quot; and &quot;KKND2: Krossfire&quot;. They released &quot;KKND2&quot; in South Korea well before they released it in the American and European markets, and pirated versions of the game were available on the internet before it was available in stores in the U.S. They were the developers of the 32-bit versions of &quot;Norse By Norse West: The Return of the Lost Vikings&quot; for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC in 1996. They also helped produce SNES games such as &quot;WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Super Smash TV&quot; and an updated version of &quot;International Cricket&quot; titled &quot;Super International Cricket&quot;. They ported the Sega Saturn game &quot;Bug!&quot; to Windows 3.x in August 1996.

1998 saw a return to RPGs with &quot;Alien Earth&quot;, again with a dialogue tree format. Also in 1998, the studio developed racing games &quot;DethKarz&quot; and &quot;GP 500&quot;.

In 1999 Beam Software was acquired by Infogrames and renamed to Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd.

=== 2000s ===
They continued to cement a reputation as a racing game developer with &quot;Le Mans 24 Hours&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot; (both Dreamcast and PlayStation 2), followed by &quot;Grand Prix Challenge&quot; (PlayStation 2), before going into third-person shooters with &quot;Men in Black II: Alien Escape&quot; (PlayStation 2, GameCube).

In 2004 the studio released &quot;Transformers&quot; for the PlayStation 2 games console based on the then current Transformers Armada franchise by Hasbro. The game reached the top of the UK PlayStation 2 games charts, making it Melbourne House&#x27;s most successful recent title.

The studio then completed work on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of Eden&#x27;s next-generation Xbox 360 title &quot;Test Drive: Unlimited&quot;.

In December 2005, Atari decided to shift away from internal development, seeking to sell its studios, including Melbourne House. In November 2006, Krome Studios acquired Melbourne House from Atari and was renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne. It was closed on 15 October 2010, along with the main Brisbane office. Next to the game development, Beam Software also had the division Smarty Pants Publishing Pty Ltd., that created software titles for kids, as well as the proprietary video compression technology VideoBeam, and Famous Faces, a facial motion capture hardware and software solution.

<text>Alphonso Gene Ford (October 31, 1971 – September 4, 2004) was an American professional basketball player. A 1.92 m (6 ft 3 in) tall, 98 kg (216 lbs.) shooting guard, he was one of the greatest scorers in college basketball history. After a short stint in the NBA, he played professionally in Europe.

Ford confirmed his tremendous scoring ability in the EuroLeague, and became a reference in the matter, notwithstanding his chronic health issues.
He was the EuroLeague Top Scorer twice (2001, 2002), and earned an All-EuroLeague selection three times. The competition&#x27;s leading scorer award bears his name, in his honor.

==Early years==
Ford was a high school star player for Amanda Elzy High School in Greenwood, Mississippi. Upon entering college basketball at Mississippi Valley State University, Ford led the entire NCAA Division I in freshman scoring, during the 1989–90 season, with a 29.9 points per game average. In his sophomore year, he averaged 32.7 points per game. He became the first player in NCAA Division I history to average 25 points per game in four straight seasons. With 3,165 career points scored in the NCAA Division I, he is 5th on the all-time scoring list, behind only Pete Maravich, Freeman Williams, Lionel Simmons, and Chris Clemons. Ford was a four-time All-Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) selection; a feat that only he and Harry Kelly accomplished.

==Professional career==

===NBA and CBA===
Ford played five games in the 1994–95 NBA season for the Philadelphia 76ers, who selected him 32nd overall in the 1993 NBA draft. Before that, he had played six games for the Seattle SuperSonics, in 1993–94. During both the 1993–94 and 1994–95 NBA seasons, Ford played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for the Tri-City Chinook. He averaged 22.8 points per game in his rookie year with the Chinook and he was selected to the All-CBA First Team and named Rookie of the Year. Ford averaged 24.0 points per game during the 1994–95 season with the Chinook.

===Europe===

====First steps towards European stardom====

In the 1995–96 season, Ford signed with Spanish first division club Peñas Huesca. However, although he played great basketball and averaged 25.1 points per game in the Spanish League, he could not prevent the team&#x27;s relegation. The next season was for Ford the opportunity to show his skills, in what was at the time Europe&#x27;s most competitive national domestic league, the Greek Basket League. He spent the season with Papagou, and led the team to a ninth-place finish, while also being the Greek competition&#x27;s leading scorer, with 23.9 points per contest. Nevertheless, glory at the European-wide level turned out to be a little bit more far away than the great scorer thought. Before the beginning of the 1997–98 season, he was diagnosed with leukemia, thus obliging Papagou to break his contract. The treatment cost Ford the whole season, but he was convinced that he had a lot more to contribute. He signed a one-year deal with Sporting, a traditional Greek club that was struggling to remain in Greece&#x27;s top basketball scene. The gifted shooting guard helped the team finish in a decent eleventh-place finish, but most importantly, he defied his disease, in an utterly remarkable way.

Ford agreed to a two-year deal with the Greek club Nikas Peristeri, before the Greek Basket League 1999–2000 season, experiencing the game, within a team with considerably higher ambitions than any of the ones he had played for in the past. Needless to say, the challenge was accepted by the player, who would become a reference in the club&#x27;s history. Ford averaged 22.7 points per game in the Greek League, leading Peristeri to a fifth-place finish in the league. Also, he made his first appearance in a European-wide competition, by playing in the European-wide 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup&#x27;s 1999–2000 season, where he scored 20.7 points per game, and reached the competition&#x27;s top 16 with his team, before they lost to Adecco Estudiantes.

====The biggest scorer in EuroLeague&#x27;s modern era====
The real breakout season for Ford though, was going to be his second one with Peristeri, in 2000–01. The team contended for the Greek Basket League 2000–01 season title, and ended up in the league&#x27;s third-place position, while he was named the league&#x27;s MVP. In parallel, the club also took part in Euroleague Basketball&#x27;s EuroLeague 2000–01 season, and Ford shined, while playing for the first time at the highest European-wide league level. He was the EuroLeague Top Scorer, averaging 26 points per game, and had a memorable 41-point outburst against Tau Ceramica in the competition&#x27;s playoffs, scoring more than half of his team&#x27;s 79 points that night. Tau qualified for the quarterfinals, sweeping the playoff series between the two teams, by two games to none, but Ford&#x27;s performance is now part of the EuroLeague legend. Finally, his nomination to the All-EuroLeague 2000–01 First Team, was at the same time, a huge recognition, and an official introduction to superstar status.

In the 2001–02 season, the Greek EuroLeague powerhouse, Olympiacos, offered Ford a $1 million net income single-year contract. His mission was to bring a team that had not won anything since the triple crown in 1997, back to the top. Ford signed the deal, and the results were immediate: he led the Reds to a Greek Cup trophy, with 20 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds, in the cup&#x27;s semifinal against Bodiroga&#x27;s Panathinaikos, and 24 points, 10 rebounds and 3 assists, in the cup&#x27;s final game, to defeat Maroussi, by a score of 66–74. In the EuroLeague 2001–02 season, Olympiacos made it to the competition&#x27;s Top 16 stage, and fell one game short of reaching the EuroLeague Final Four. Ford could actually not prevent an 85–89 home loss to Olimpija Ljubljana, although he had a solid performance that night, with 21 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. He was once again the EuroLeague&#x27;s Top Scorer, at 24.8 points per game, and was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2001–02 Second Team. The season ended with a loss in the Greek League&#x27;s championship finals series to AEK, with Ford missing the last two crucial games of the series, due to an injury.

Olympiacos changed for the EuroLeague 2002–03 season. The major Greek EuroLeague clubs were forced to reduce their budgets, due to the renovation of their arenas for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens. They therefore became considerably less competitive in the league. Ford&#x27;s contract with Olympiacos was subsequently not renewed, and he signed a new contract with the Italian league&#x27;s EuroLeague contender, Mens Sana Siena. Ford had a quick adaptation period to his new team, and although his scoring average in the EuroLeague dropped to 17.9 points per game, he was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2002–03 First Team, after Siena qualified to the 2003 EuroLeague Final Four. Unfortunately, Ford had one of his worst shooting nights ever, in the semifinal against Benetton Treviso: he scored 15 points, making only 5 of his 19 shots. His 7 rebounds and 2 steals did not allow his team to overcome Benetton&#x27;s obstacle, as they lost 62–65 in a highly intense game. In the Italian League 2002–03 season, Ford averaged 19.1 points per game, and Siena finished in fourth place in the league.

==Final season and death==
Despite his leukemia being in an advanced stage, Ford played the Italian League 2003–04 season with Scavolini Pesaro. Averaging 22.2 points per game in the Italian League, Ford, in his final season, helped Scavolini finish in fourth place in the Italian League, which meant the team qualified to the next season&#x27;s EuroLeague, and to the Italian Cup&#x27;s runner-up position, despite being near death.

Shortly after announcing his retirement from the EuroLeague, Ford died from leukemia, at age 32. He is survived by his wife Paula, their daughter Quekenshia, and their sons Karlderek, Alphonso Jr. In Ford&#x27;s honor, the EuroLeague named its trophy for the leading scorer of the year, the Alphonso Ford EuroLeague Top Scorer Trophy. The player who replaced Ford on Scavolini Pesaro, following his death, Charles Smith, would win the award the very next season.

In 2021, a documentary dedicated to the life of Alphonso Ford, titled Alphonso Ford: Score Until The Last Day, premiered at the Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival, receiving critical acclaim.

<text>No. 28 Squadron was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Active Reserve squadron, based at HMAS &quot;Harman&quot; in the Australian Capital Territory. Its main role was public affairs and imagery. The squadron was formed in 1983 and disbanded in 2020.

==History==
Raised on 1 July 1983 at RAAF Base Fairbairn, the squadron relocated to HMAS Harman upon the closure of the Fairbairn in May 2004. The squadron was initially designated as an Auxiliary unit, forming part of the Citizens Air Force, but this terminology was changed in September 1983, at which point the unit became an Active Reserve squadron.

The squadron consisted of a small group of Regular personnel who administered the Reserve elements of the unit. The majority of the Reserve personnel were tasked with various base support and other roles including communications, information technology, intelligence, logistics, and planning. From 2012 the squadron also handled most of the RAAF&#x27;s public affairs capability.

The squadron had a flight based at RAAF Wagga Wagga, which was raised in 1988. The squadron also operated the RAAF&#x27;s hot air balloon until that function was transferred to the Central Flying School.

On 11 September 2015, the squadron received the Governor General&#x27;s banner for 25 years of service. During this period the unit had supported operations in Timor Leste, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Solomon Islands.

No. 28 Squadron was disbanded on 10 December 2020. Its public affairs function was transferred to No. 464 Squadron.

==Career==

===1991–1996: Commercial success with Show Wesugi===
The band was founded in 1991 by main vocalist Show Wesugi, guitarist Hiroshi Shibasaki, and keyboardist Kousuke Oshima. Wesugi was a fan of Axl Rose and Oshima was a guest member of Japanese rock band Loudness. The band was named after wands of tarot. They debuted with single &quot;Sabishisa wa Aki no Iro (Loneliness is Autumn Color)&quot;. Their 1992 single &quot;Motto Tsuyoku Dakishimeta Nara (If I Embrace You More Strongly)&quot; reached #1 and was charted for 44 weeks on the Japanese Oricon charts.

In 1992, Shinya Kimura joined the band following Oshima&#x27;s departure. Collaborating with Miho Nakayama, they released &quot;Sekaijū no Dare Yori Kitto (Certainly More Than Everybody in the World)&quot; in October 1992, which became one of the standard J-pop songs. That year, they took part in &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, a famous year-end show in Japan, with this song.

Wesugi wrote Deen&#x27;s debut song &quot;Konomama Kimidake wo Ubaisaritai (Now, I Want to Make Off with Only You)&quot;, which sold over a million copies after its release in March 1993. In April, their album &quot;Toki no Tobira&quot; &quot;(Temporal Door)&quot; and single &quot;Ai wo Kataru yori Kuchizuke wo Kawaso (Let&#x27;s Kiss More Than Talking Love)&quot; both reached #1 positions on the Oricon charts, making them the second artist to achieve this, following Seiko Matsuda. &quot;Ai wo Kataru yori Kuchizuke wo Kawaso&quot; remained #1 for four consecutive weeks. &quot;Toki no Tobira&quot; was charted for 33 weeks on the Oricon album charts. They sold over 4.11 million singles and 3.18 million albums in a year, winning the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 8th Japan Gold Disc Award.

Their 1994 single &quot;Sekai ga Owaru made wa... (Until the End of the World...)&quot; reached #1 on Oricon charts, gaining over 1.2 million sales and was certified as a million-selling single by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was the closing theme song of the anime series &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;. Wesugi loved grunge and wanted to turn into alternative rock. &quot;Sekai ga Owaru made wa...&quot; became the last song written in his former style because he felt that many musicians around him were doing the same thing. Their next single, &quot;Secret Night (It&#x27;s My Treat),&quot; shifted to power pop and created controversies. Their 1995 studio album, &quot;Piece of My Soul,&quot; reached the #1 position on the Oricon charts, with sales of over 542,000 copies the first week.

Wesugi&#x27;s image continued to change with the song &quot;Same Side&quot;. His new style was said to be &quot;painterly&quot; and their new album was influenced by punk and blues, according to Wesugi. After the release of the single &quot;Worst Crime (About a Rock Star who was a Swindler)&quot; in February 1996, Wesugi and Shibasaki withdrew from the band. Their withdrawals were officially announced in 1997.

Wesugi continued his music career and performed in the sixth anniversary of Hide&#x27;s death in 2004. Shibasaki formed rock band Abingdon Boys School with Takanori Nishikawa in 2005. Oshima also worked with Nishikawa on the 2006 album &quot;Under Cover&quot;.

===1997–2000: Third period with Jiro Waku===
Shinya Kimura re-formed the group with vocalist Jiro Waku and guitarist Issei Sugimoto. Jiro Waku, whose real name is Jiro Matsumoto, was the first leader of twelve skateboarding boys (predecessor of SMAP) in Johnny &amp; Associates. Their debut song, &quot;Sabitsuita Machine Gun de Ima o Uchinukō&quot;, written by Miho Komatsu, was used as the end credits theme for &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. Their next single, &quot;Brand New Love&quot;, was written by Izumi Sakai. Sakai also wrote the song &quot;Ashita moshi Kimi ga kowaretemo&quot; (lit. &quot;Even if you shatter tomorrow&quot;), which was used as the closing theme for the first series of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; produced by Toei Animation. Their next single, &quot;Kyo, Nanika no Hazumi de Ikiteiru&quot; (lit. &quot;Today, I live by some chance&quot;), was written by Nana Azuki, a future member of Garnet Crow, and by Makoto Miyoshi, a future member of Rumania Montevideo. However, their first studio album, &quot;Awake&quot;, released on 27 October 1999, only charted for three weeks, peaking at #18 on the Oricon charts. Through the official website, the band from the third period announced its disbandment in 2000.

===2019-present: Fourth and Fifth Wands period with Daishi Uehara===
On 13 November 2019, the fifth period of Wands was announced with new vocalist, Daishi Uehara, along with former members Shibasaki and Kimura. On 17 November 2019, the band made their first stage appearance in 18 years at Dojima River Forum. In January 2020, their new original song, &quot;Makka na Lip&quot;, was released under the Giza Studio record label. It is also the opening theme song of the anime television series &quot;Detective Conan&quot;.

On 16 February 2020, it was announced that a new single, &quot;Daki Yose, Takamaru, Kimi no Taion to Tomoni&quot;, written by Shibasaki and Haibara, would be released in May. The announcement happened after a Special Live event. The single was promoted as the theme song of the Japanese television series &quot;Silent Voice&quot;. It is their first television drama theme song for the first time in 28 years.

In 2024, Uehara collaborated with the guitarist from the same music agency, Tak Matsumoto on the covers single &quot;Toki no Sugiyuku Mama ni&quot;, which will be included in the kayokyoku cover&#x27;s album The Hit Parade II.

<text>The Dujiangyan () is an ancient irrigation system in Dujiangyan City, Sichuan, China. Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system&#x27;s infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. King Zhao of Qin commissioned the project, and the construction of the Dujiangyan harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over of land in the region and has produced comprehensive benefits in flood control, irrigation, water transport and general water consumption. Begun over 2,250 years ago, it now irrigates 668,700 hectares of farmland. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the &quot;three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin.&quot;

Dujiangyan Irrigation System were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2000. It has also been declared a State Priority Protected Site, among the first batch of National Scenic Areas and Historical Sites, and a National ISO14000 Demonstration Area.

==History==
===Planning===
During the Warring States period, people who lived in the area of the Min River were plagued by annual flooding. Qin hydrologist Li Bing investigated the problem and discovered that the river was swelled by fast flowing spring melt-water from the local mountains that burst the banks when it reached the slow moving and heavily silted stretch below.

One solution would have been to build a dam, but the Qin wanted to keep the waterway open for military vessels to supply troops on the frontier, so instead an artificial levee was constructed to redirect a portion of the river&#x27;s flow and then to cut a channel through Mount Yulei to discharge the excess water upon the dry Chengdu Plain beyond.

===Construction===
King Zhao of Qin allocated 100,000 taels of silver for the project and sent a team said to number tens of thousands. The levee was constructed from long sausage-shaped baskets of woven bamboo filled with stones known as Zhulong held in place by wooden tripods known as Macha. The construction of a water-diversion levee resembling a fish&#x27;s mouth took four years to complete.

Cutting the channel proved to be a far greater problem, as the hand tools available at the time, prior to the invention of gunpowder, would have taken decades to cut through the mountain. Li Bing devised an ingenious method of using fire and water to rapidly heat and cool the rocks, causing them to crack and allowing them to be easily removed. After eight years of work, a channel wide had been gouged through the mountain.

===Legacy===

After the system was finished, no more floods occurred. The irrigation made Sichuan the most productive agricultural region in China for a time. The construction is also credited with giving the people of the region a laid-back attitude to life; by eliminating disaster and ensuring a regular and bountiful harvest, it left them with plenty of free time.

Turmoil surrounding the conquering of Chengdu by peasant rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong in 1644, and the Ming-Qing transition more generally, led to depopulation and the deterioration of the Dujiangyan irrigation system to the point where rice cultivation was set back for decades. The original Dujiangyan irrigation system was destroyed by the 1933 Diexi earthquake. The current Dujiangyan irrigation system was rebuilt after the Diexi earthquake in 1933 by Zhang Yuan (张沅) and his sons, including Zhang Shiling (张世龄).

In 2000, Dujiangyan became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today it has become a major tourist attraction.

===2008 Sichuan earthquake===

On May 12, 2008, a massive earthquake struck a vast portion of west Sichuan, including the Dujiangyan area. Initial reports indicated that the Yuzui Levee was cracked but not severely damaged. Diversion of flow could still be seen as the river turns.

==Engineering constructions==

===Irrigation head===
The irrigation system consists of three main constructions that work in harmony with one another to ensure against flooding and keep the fields well supplied with water:

The Yuzui or Fish Mouth Levee (Chinese:鱼嘴), named for its conical head that is said to resemble the mouth of a fish, is the key part of the construction. It is an artificial levee that divides the water into inner and outer streams. The inner stream is deep and narrow, while the outer stream is relatively shallow but wide. This special structure ensures that the inner stream carries approximately 60% of the river&#x27;s flow into the irrigation system during dry season. While during flood, this amount decreases to 40% to protect the people from flooding. The outer stream drains away the rest, flushing out much of the silt and sediment.

The Feishayan or Flying Sand Weir (Chinese:飞沙堰) has a -wide opening that connects the inner and outer streams. This ensures against flooding by allowing the natural swirling flow of the water to drain out excess water from the inner to the outer stream. The swirl also drains out silt and sediment that failed to go into the outer stream. A modern reinforced concrete weir has replaced the original weighted bamboo baskets.

The Baopingkou or Bottle-Neck Channel (Chinese:宝瓶口), which was gouged through the mountain, is the final part of the system. The channel distributes the water to the farmlands in the Chengdu Plain, whilst the narrow entrance, that gives it its name, works as a check gate, creating the whirlpool flow that carries away the excess water over Flying Sand Fence, to ensure against flooding.

===Anlan Suspension Bridge===
Anlan or Couple&#x27;s Bridge spans the full width of the river connecting the artificial island to both banks and is known as one of the &quot;Five Ancient Bridges of China&quot;. The original Zhupu Bridge only spanned the inner stream connecting the levee to the foot of Mount Yulei. This was replaced in the Song dynasty by Pingshi Bridge which burned down during the wars that marked the end of the Ming dynasty.

In 1803 during the Qing dynasty a local man named He Xiande and his wife proposed the construction of a replacement, made of wooden plates and bamboo handrails, to span both streams and this was nicknamed Couple&#x27;s Bridge in their honour. This was demolished in the 1970s and replaced by a modern bridge.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

The Dujiangyan irrigation system is located in the western portion of the Chengdu flatlands, at the junction between the Sichuan basin and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

=== Geology ===
The Dujiangyan irrigation system is located at the turning point of the two topographic steps of the western plateau mountains and the Chengdu Plain. It is the southwest extension of the Longmen Mountains and the area through which the Longmen Mountain Fault Zone passes.

=== Topography and geomorphology ===
The Dujiangyan irrigation system is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast. The west belongs to the southern section of Longmen Mountains, with the mountain elevation below 3000 meters. The east is Chengdu Plain, with an altitude of 720 meters.

=== Hydrology ===

The Dujiangyan irrigation system was built at the entrance of Minjiang River, with an average annual inflow of 15.082 billion cubic meters. There are two hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. One is the Zipingpu Dam at the mouth of the main stream. The water catchment area of the control survey is 22664 square kilometers, accounting for 98.38% of the total water catchment area of the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. The other is Yangliuping Dam at the outlet of Baisha River, with a controlled catchment area of 363 square kilometers, accounting for 1.58% of the total catchment area. There is a catchment area of 10 square kilometers from Estuary of Baisha River to Dujiangyan irrigation system, accounting for 0.04% of the total catchment area.

==Temple sites==

===Two Kings Temple===

Erwang or Two Kings Temple is on the bank of the river at the foot of Mount Yulei. The original Wangdi Temple built in memory of an ancient Shu king was moved, so locals renamed the temple here.

The 10,072 m2 Qing dynasty wooden complex conforms to the traditional standard of temple design except that it does not follow a north–south axis. The main hall, which contains a modern statue of Li Bing, opens up onto a courtyard facing an opera stage. On Li Bing&#x27;s traditional birthday, 24th day of the 7th month of the lunar calendar, local operas were performed for the public, and on Tomb Sweeping Day a Water Throwing Festival is held.

The rear hall contains a modern statue of the god Erlang Shen. Because it would be a problem if a family had no offspring in Chinese feudal society, locals regarded this Erlang as Li Bing&#x27;s son. Guanlantin Pavilion stands above the complex and is inscribed with wise words from Li Bing such as, &quot;When the river flows in zigzags, cut a straight channel; when the riverbed is wide and shallow, dig it deeper.&quot;

===Dragon-Taming Temple===

Fulongguan or Dragon-Taming Temple in Lidui Park was founded in the third century in honour of Fan Changsheng. Following Li Bing&#x27;s death a hall was established here in his honour and the temple was renamed to commemorate the dragon fighting legends that surrounded him. It is here that Erlang Shen, the legendary son of Li Bing, is said to have chained the dragon that he and his seven sworn brothers had captured in an ambush at the River God Temple when it came to collect a human sacrifice. This action is said to have protected the region from floods ever since.

During the East Han dynasty a statue of Li Bing was placed in the river to monitor the water flow, with the level rising above his shoulders to indicate flood and falling beneath his calves to indicate drought. Recovered from the river in 1974 and placed on display in the main hall, this is the oldest known stone statue of a human in China.

<doc id="984355" wikidata="Q221163" url="?curid=984355" title="Uranium glass">
<text>Uranium glass is glass which has had uranium, usually in oxide diuranate form, added to a glass mix before melting for colouration. The proportion usually varies from trace levels to about 2% uranium by weight, although some 20th-century pieces were made with up to 25% uranium.

First identified in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, uranium was soon being added to decorative glass for its fluorescent effect. James Powell&#x27;s Whitefriars Glass company in London, England, was one of the first to market the glowing glass, but other manufacturers soon realised its sales potential and uranium glass was produced across Europe and later in Ohio.

Uranium glass was made into tableware and household items, but fell out of widespread use when the availability of uranium to most industries was sharply curtailed during the Cold War in the 1940s to 1990s, with the vast majority of the world&#x27;s uranium supply being utilised as a strategic material for use in nuclear weapons or nuclear power. Most uranium glass is now considered to be antiques or retro-era collectables, although there has been a minor revival in art glassware. Otherwise, modern uranium glass is now mainly limited to small objects like beads or marbles as scientific or decorative novelties.

==Appearance==
The normal colour of uranium glass ranges from yellow to green depending on the oxidation state and concentration of the metal ions, although this may be altered by the addition of other elements as glass colorants. Uranium glass also fluoresces bright green under ultraviolet light.

===Vaseline glass===
The most common color of uranium glass is pale yellowish-green, which in the 1930s led to the nickname &quot;Vaseline glass&quot;, based on a perceived resemblance to the appearance of Vaseline-brand petroleum jelly as formulated at that time. Specialized collectors still define Vaseline glass as transparent or semi-transparent uranium glass in this specific color.

Vaseline glass is sometimes used as a synonym for any uranium glass, especially in the United States, but this usage is frowned upon, since Vaseline-brand petroleum jelly was only yellow, not other colors. The term is sometimes applied to other types of glass based on certain aspects of their superficial appearance in normal light, regardless of actual uranium content which requires a blacklight test to verify the characteristic green fluorescence.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term Vaseline glass can be used to refer to any type of translucent glass.

=== Other colors ===
Several other common subtypes of uranium glass have their own nicknames: 
* Custard glass (opaque or semiopaque pale yellow)
* Jadite glass (opaque or semi-opaque pale green; initially, the name was trademarked as &quot;Jadite&quot;, although this is sometimes over-corrected in modern usage to &quot;jadeite&quot;)
* Depression glass (transparent or semitransparent pale green).
* Burmese glass (opaque glass that shades from pink to yellow)
Like &quot;Vaseline&quot;, the terms &quot;custard&quot; and &quot;jad(e)ite&quot; are often applied on the basis of superficial appearance rather than uranium content. Conversely, &quot;Depression glass&quot; is a general description for any piece of glassware manufactured during the Great Depression regardless of appearance or formula.

==Fabrication==

Uranium glass is used as one of several intermediate glasses in what is known to scientific glass blowers as a &#x27;graded seal&#x27;. This is typically used in glass-to-metal seals such as tungsten and molybdenum or nickel based alloys such as Kovar, as an intermediary glass between the metal sealing glass and lower expansion borosilicate glass.

==Usage==

===Ancient usage===
The use of uranium glass dates back to at least 79 AD, the date of a mosaic containing yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide, which was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, in 1912.

=== Medieval usage ===
Starting in the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry.

=== Modern usage ===
In 1789, Martin Klaproth discovered uranium. He later experimented with the use of the element as a glass colourant.

Uranium glass became popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, with its period of greatest popularity being from the 1880s to the 1920s.

The first major producer of items made of uranium glass is commonly recognized as Austrian Franz Xaver Riedel, who named the yellow () and yellow-green (German: Gelb-Grün) varieties of the glass &quot;annagelb&quot; and &quot;annagrün&quot;, respectively, in honor of his daughter Anna Maria. Riedel was a prolific blower of uranium glass in Unter-Polaun (today Dolni Polubny), Bohemia from 1830 to 1848.

By the 1840s, many other European glassworks began to produce uranium glass items and developed new varieties of uranium glass. The Baccarat glassworks in France created an opaque green uranium glass which they named chrysoprase from its similarity to that green form of chalcedony.

At the end of the 19th century, glassmakers discovered that uranium glass with certain mineral additions could be tempered at high temperatures, inducing varying degrees of micro-crystallization. This produced a range of increasingly opaque glasses from the traditional transparent yellow or yellow-green to an opaque white. During the Depression years, more iron oxide was added to the mixture to match popular preferences for a greener glass. This material, technically a glass-ceramic, acquired the name &quot;vaseline glass&quot; because of its supposedly similar appearance to petroleum jelly. , a few manufacturers continue the vaseline glass tradition: Fenton Glass, Mosser Glass, Gibson Glass and Jack Loranger.

U.S. production of uranium glasses ceased in the middle years of World War II because of the government&#x27;s confiscation of uranium supplies for the Manhattan Project from 1942 to 1958. After the restrictions in the United States were eased, several firms resumed production of uranium glass, including Fenton and Mosser; though uranium was still regulated as a strategic material. Following the Cold War, restrictions on uranium glass were completely lifted. During this time many older pieces entered the free market and new pieces continued to be produced in small quantities into the 2000s.

Riihimäki Glass produced uranium glass designer pieces after World War II.

== Health concerns ==
Uranium glass can register above background radiation on a sufficiently sensitive Geiger counter, although most pieces of uranium glass are considered to be harmless and only negligibly radioactive. A study conducted on uranium glass in a private collection found that the dose rates of beta and gamma radiation emitted from the glass posed no danger to the public or to conservators.

<text>Pölsa is a traditional northern Swedish dish that is a close relative to Scottish haggis. The main ingredients are beef sinew, liver, heart, lung, onion, and barley, mixed with stock, black pepper, and marjoram. Sometimes ground beef or minced pork is added. It is usually served with mashed or boiled potatoes and pickled beetroot, and sometimes a fried egg.
==Background==
The Norwegian and Danish word &quot;pølse&quot; means sausage and even if the two dishes don&#x27;t look the same, the two words are related. Pölsa is simply a traditional variety of sausage filling without any casing.

== In popular culture ==
The dish plays a central role in the allegorical novel &quot;Pölsan&quot; (2002) by Swedish author Torgny Lindgren (1938–2017), in which two men go on a personal quest across postwar Sweden in search of the genuine Swedish &quot;pölsa&quot;.

<text>The M2 is a route in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that links Sydney suburbs from Artarmon in the south-east to Bella Vista in the north-west. The route consists of two separately named motorways, the M2 Hills Motorway and the Lane Cove Tunnel. 

The M2 route replaces the motorway sections of what was known as Metroad 2 from 1993 to 2013, with the non-motorway sections replaced by the A2 route (made up of Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road).

==Lane Cove Tunnel and M2 Hills Motorway==

The Lane Cove Tunnel was open to traffic in March 2007. Prior to the opening of the Lane Cove Tunnel, the Metroad 2 followed Epping Road, between the Pacific Highway and Mowbray Road west. The M2 Hills Motorway was opened nearly 10 years prior to the Lane Cove Tunnel in May 1997, replacing sections of Metroad 2 between North Ryde and Baulkham Hills, between Old Windsor road and Carlingford Road, along Epping Road to Delhi Road, Beecroft Road, Pennant Hills Road (Part of the Cumberland Highway), Castle Hill Road and Showground Road, Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road.

==History of the Metroad 2 route==
Prior to the opening of the M2 Hills Motorway in 1997, the Metroad 2 route ran along Epping Road, Beecroft Road, Pennant Hills Road (Part of the Cumberland Highway), Castle Hill Road and Showground Road, Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road. These former stretches were parts of State Routes 28 and 30 until Metroad 2 replaced them in November 1993.

The southern/eastern extremity of Metroad 2 was originally at the city end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with the Warringah Freeway and Gore Hill Freeway duplexed as both Metroad 1 and Metroad 2. However the route was later truncated with Metroad 2 ending at the east end of the Lane Cove Tunnel.

In 2013 with the introduction of alphanumeric route numbers in New South Wales, Metroad 2 was decommissioned, with the motorway sections replaced by route M2, and the non-motorway sections (Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road) receiving the A2 marker.

<text>James Graham Cooper (June 19, 1830 – July 19, 1902) was an American surgeon and naturalist.

Cooper was born in New York. He worked for the California Geological Survey (1860–1874) with Josiah Dwight Whitney, William Henry Brewer and Henry Nicholas Bolander. He was primarily a zoologist, but he also made significant botanical collections from San Diego to Fort Mohave, Arizona in 1861. Cooper was active in the California Academy of Sciences, eventually becoming Director of the Museum.

He obtained his medical degree in 1851 and practiced in New York City until 1853. Spencer F. Baird, the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution at that time, helped Cooper work with the Pacific railroad survey parties working in the Washington Territory. He joined this survey under Captain George McClellan as a surgeon until 1854. In 1855 he visited San Francisco and the Panama Isthmus. He collected many birds during this expedition.

In 1860, he returned west and joined the Blake Expedition that went from St. Louis up to the Missouri River and into Idaho and Washington. He worked as a contract surgeon for brief periods with the US Army and Josiah Whitney, the chief of the California Geological Survey. Along with Baird he wrote a book on the birds of California &quot;Ornithology, Volume I, Land Birds&quot; in 1870.

His marriage in 1866 made it difficult for him to balance his interest in natural history. He worked in San Mateo, Oakland, and San Francisco and finally settled in 1875 in Hayward. He wrote on his difficulties in a letter in 1870

His father William Cooper was also a naturalist.

<doc id="984362" wikidata="Q5574352" url="?curid=984362" title="Gnomes of Zurich">
<text>Gnomes of Zurich is a disparaging term for Swiss bankers.
Swiss bankers are popularly associated with extremely secretive policies, while gnomes in fairy tales live underground, in secret, counting their riches. Zürich is the commercial centre of Switzerland.

==History==
After World War II, British Labour party politicians were worried about speculation against the pound undermining the economic regime. Economic growth in the United Kingdom was low, only half that of Germany and France. The demand for pound sterling started to fall.

Although Swiss bankers had been criticised in Britain since the 1950s, the term &quot;gnomes of Zürich&quot; originated in a crisis meeting of the Labour politicians in November 1964. The politicians blamed Swiss bankers for raising speculation against the pound. During the meeting, politician George Brown criticised the Swiss bankers and said, &quot;The gnomes of Zürich are at work again.&quot; The term &quot;Gnomes of Zürich&quot; was then used by many other politicians of the time. Then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson vowed to resist the gnomes&#x27; sinister power.

Paul Rossy, a top banker in Zürich at the time, stated, &quot;In the world it is not the image, but the substance behind the image which counts.&quot; The phrase &quot;gnomes of Zürich&quot; was adopted by the Americans as well.

==Impact==
Soon after the catchphrase became famous, a few Swiss bankers started answering their phone as &quot;Hello, gnome speaking&quot;. A Swiss banker who moved to London was nicknamed the gnome of Notting Hill. The phrase also gave name to the 1966 T. R. Fehrenbach book on the history and practices of Swiss private banking, &quot;The Gnomes of Zurich&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; listed the gnomes of Zurich with the military-industrial complex, The Establishment, and Illuminati as part of the shadow government.

In the early 21st century, Zürich bankers are still very wealthy, but less powerful compared to London, New York, Dubai, and Shanghai as leading financial capitals. The Zürich Money Museum displays the sculpture of a gnome - founder Jürg Conzett says that nowadays, bankers see gnome as almost a noble title. Bankers currently based in London who are agitated by rising taxes, stricter regulation and public animosity towards investment banking have considered moving in large numbers to Zürich itself, where banking is &quot;the state religion&quot;.

==Other uses==

* The phrase is reflected in the traditions of the Zürich Grasshoppers Rugby Club, whose mascot is a gnome and which occasionally plays a third/casual team called the Gnomes.
* Gnomes of Zurich is also the name of a 1960s rock band from North East England, and a 1990s psychedelic rock band from Minneapolis.
* The Gnomes of Zürich are one of the playable factions in Steve Jackson&#x27;s card game of conspiracy, &quot;Illuminati&quot;. Their goal is to collect a specified amount of megabucks, the game&#x27;s currency.
* The phrase is reflected in the &quot;Black Swan Man&quot; comic, where the main character gained deep financial knowledge by living with Alpine gnomes in his youth. 
* The original version of the computer game &quot;Zork&quot; makes reference to an &quot;epicene gnome of Zurich&quot;.
* Valiant Comics&#x27; &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot; features a group of literal gnomes referred to as the Gnomes of Zurich, one of many factions within the Sect formed to kill the titular Armstrong.
* The &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; adventure-book &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; plays on the term by featuring a stockbroker family called the Zuriches in the city of Nome.

<text>The Exmoor Horn is a white faced, horned breed of sheep. It was developed in Exmoor, Devon, in the 19th century, but is a descendant of sheep that had roamed on the moors for several hundred years.

Research by the Exmoor National Park has found that numbers have gradually declined: it estimates that in 1947 over 27% of sheep in the Somerset part of Exmoor were pure bred Exmoor Horns. As the number of sheep in the region has increased, the percentage has dropped, and today breeding Exmoor Horn ewes represent only about 10% of the total on Exmoor. The National Park reports that there are about 19,000 registered breeding ewes today, of which around 15,000 are on Exmoor. Small numbers are also found on neighbouring Dartmoor.

Exmoors are a hardy breed, so well suited to the high moors. They are ‘dual purpose’ - bred not just for their wool, but also for the fact that they are prolific sheep and good mothers, producing quality lamb.

<doc id="984365" wikidata="Q508712" url="?curid=984365" title="Knick Knack">
<text>Knick Knack is a 1989 American animated short film produced by Pixar that was written and directed by John Lasseter. The short is about a snow globe snowman who wants to join the other travel souvenirs in a summer-themed party. However, the glass dome that surrounds him prevents him from doing so, thus leading to his many tries to break out of his snow globe. &quot;Knick Knack&quot; is Pixar&#x27;s fourth short and the final short produced during the company&#x27;s tenure as a hardware company. It was also the final Pixar short film released before the company&#x27;s first feature-length film &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

The short stands out from Lasseter&#x27;s other early short films at Pixar in its reliance on pure comedy to drive the story. It was inspired by &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, and the work of animators Chuck Jones and Tex Avery. Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places and those elements made their way into the short as well. Singer Bobby McFerrin improvised the a cappella vocal jazz soundtrack to the film while watching a rough cut which was eventually left unchanged in its final edition.

&quot;Knick Knack&quot; debuted at the 1989 SIGGRAPH convention in Boston and was presented in 3D. The short has enjoyed positive reviews since its debut and has been screened as a part of numerous film festivals. The short has now been associated with &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, with a remastered version of the short being shown before it in that film&#x27;s original theatrical run.

== Plot ==
On a bookshelf filled with vacation-themed souvenirs, a lonely and grumpy playboy knick-knack snowman named Knick, who resides in a &quot;Nome Sweet Nome, Alaska&quot; snow globe, wants to reach a female &quot;Sunny Miami&quot; knick-knack that shows an attractive blonde and tanned pool-lounger, wearing a blue speedo and sunglasses. Knick tries several unsuccessful methods to break out of the globe, which includes ramming the glass with the snow globe&#x27;s igloo backdrop, using his carrot nose and a hammer on the glass, using a jackhammer (which causes his facial features to fall off), trying to cut the glass using a blowtorch and an igniter, and detonating TNT explosives. The latter causes the globe to fall over the edge. Knick notices an emergency exit in the base and frees himself just before he and the globe fall into a fishbowl where Knick sees an identical mermaid souvenir from &quot;Sunny Atlantis&quot; and starts gawking at her, this only backfires when he attempts to run towards her, the globe settles to the bottom and traps him again, much to his annoyance.

== Background ==
In 1988, Pixar&#x27;s third short film, &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-animated film to claim the Academy Award. It was also the first win for the hardware company, which was still struggling to sell its main product: the Pixar Image Computer. The key animator and director behind &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, John Lasseter, had once worked at Disney several years prior but was fired by unknowingly stepping on his superiors&#x27; toes with his support for computer animation. Now, Disney took notice of the Oscar win for &quot;Tin Toy&quot; and began a campaign to win Lasseter back.

Lasseter turned the studio&#x27;s offer for a directorial position down, remarking to Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, &quot;I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.&quot; Jeffrey Katzenberg, the then-head of Walt Disney Studios, had a reputation for being difficult and controlling. In contrast, Lasseter received complete creative freedom at Pixar&#x27;s small animation division and was highly respected by his colleagues. In addition to capturing Disney&#x27;s interest, Pixar owner Steve Jobs&#x27; interest in the animation group was invigorated, and he approved production of another short.

== Production ==
After the headaches of animating Billy the baby in &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, Lasseter backed away from depicting human characters. The team all agreed to do something simpler that would not &quot;drive us all crazy,&quot; according to producer Ralph Guggenheim. When watching &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; during the production of &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, Lasseter became inspired to create a Chuck Jones-type of cartoon. Rather than challenge the limitations of the computer as they had done in the previous shorts, the animators wanted to make a short based on geometric shapes instead, which was a strength of the computer. In a discussion with the group, Lasseter brought up famed Warner Bros. and MGM director Tex Avery, noting that his cartoons were wild and exuberant, yet not necessarily very complex. Lasseter collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places; from those elements, &quot;Knick Knack&quot;—the only pure comedy among Lasseter&#x27;s early short films at Pixar—began to fall into place.

The rest of the team were also fans of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons and the work of Chuck Jones and found the idea of cartoonish violence appealing. Animator Flip Phillips and production coordinator Deirdre Warin simultaneously hit on the idea of the snow globe falling into a fishbowl. Craig Good came up with the idea of an &quot;iris out,&quot; a shrinking circle at the close, as a reference to &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. A skeleton on the shelf in the short was a 3D model from an Ohio State University skeleton data set called George, though the Pixar team stretched George&#x27;s arms for comic effect. Also distorted were the two female characters—the bikini-attired woman and a mermaid—whose breasts were ultra-exaggerated thanks to a technical director who was a pinup enthusiast.

The singer Bobby McFerrin created the musical soundtrack and a cappella vocal jazz track which he improvised while watching a rough cut of the film. As the rough cut ended, the placeholder credits read &quot;blah-blah-blah-blah&quot;, so he sang those words and it remained in the film&#x27;s score. McFerrin did the score for free out of a belief that the film was cool to be involved with. Gary Rydstrom of Lucasfilm created the sound effects for the short.

== Release and re-releases ==
&quot;Knick Knack&quot; debuted at the 1989 SIGGRAPH in Boston. It was one of the last pieces of animation that Lasseter would animate personally during Pixar&#x27;s years as an independent company. In 1990, it won the Best Short Film award at the Seattle International Film Festival. When Lasseter presented it at the London Film Festival in 1991, &quot;The Independent&quot; of London called it &quot;a four-minute masterpiece&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; hailed Lasseter as &quot;probably the closest thing to God that has ever graced the electronic images community.&quot; In 2001, Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time. After &quot;Knick Knack&quot;, Pixar took a break from animated shorts and re-focused on animating television commercials to build income and hire new animators.

The film has been released in two versions, and each of these has been shown in both 3-D and 2-D. The original version was shown in 3-D in 1989 at the SIGGRAPH program, and was released on the VHS and LaserDisc, &quot;Tiny Toy Stories&quot;, and also on the &quot;Toy Story&quot; Deluxe CAV LaserDisc edition. The short was later released on May 30, 2003, in theaters with &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. For this release, the film was re-rendered with design adjustments for the woman on the &quot;Miami&quot; knick-knack and the mermaid in the fishbowl. Both characters now have much smaller breasts and the mermaid is now wearing a seashell bra rather than just starfish pasties. Lasseter defended the changes by saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t big bad Disney coming in and insisting we do this … it was our own choice. It was just crossing the line for me personally as a father. So I decided to reduce [these characters&#x27;] breast size.&quot;

This updated version is preceded with the message &quot;In 1989, six years before Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios made this short film.&quot; This version was first made available with the &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; DVD &amp; VHS. This version is subsequently on &quot;Nemo&quot;&#x27;s Blu-ray, the &quot;Pixar Short Films Collection – Volume 1&quot; DVD and Blu-ray, and on digital services that feature Pixar&#x27;s shorts including Disney+. A 3-D version of the new edition played to the public as a short attached to the 2006 Disney Digital 3-D release of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.

<doc id="984367" wikidata="Q944563" url="?curid=984367" title="Richard Coles">
<text>Richard Keith Robert Coles (born 26 March 1962) is an English writer, radio presenter and Church of England priest. He first came to prominence as the multi-instrumentalist who partnered Jimmy Somerville in the 1980s band the Communards. They achieved three UK top ten hits, including the No. 1 record and best-selling single of 1986, a dance version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;.

Coles frequently appears on radio and television as well as in newspapers and, from March 2011 until March 2023, was the co-host of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Live&quot; programme. He is a regular contributor to the television shows &quot;QI&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He is the chancellor of the University of Northampton, a former honorary chaplain to the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, and a patron of social housing project Greatwell Homes in Wellingborough.

==Early life==
Coles was born in Northampton, England. His grandfather was a prosperous shoe manufacturer. The company failed under Coles&#x27;s father, because of the increasing popularity of cheaper foreign imports, and the family lost much of its wealth.

He was educated at the independent Wellingborough School (where he was a choirboy), and at the South Warwickshire College of Further Education (Department of Drama &amp; the Liberal Arts) in Stratford-upon-Avon. He later attended King&#x27;s College London, where he studied Theology from 1990. Coles was awarded an MA by research from the University of Leeds in 2005 for work on the Greek text of the Epistle to the Ephesians.

==Career==

===Music===
Coles learned to play the saxophone, clarinet and keyboards, and moved to London in 1980, where he played in theatre. In 1983, he appeared with Jimmy Somerville in the Lesbian and Gay Youth Video Project film &quot;Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts&quot;, which won the Grierson Award. Coles joined Bronski Beat (initially on saxophone) in 1983.

Somerville left Bronski Beat, and in 1985 he and Coles formed the Communards, who were together for just over three years and had three UK top 10 hits, including the biggest-selling single of 1986, a version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, which was at number one for four weeks. The band split in 1988, and Somerville went solo.

===Church ministry===

Coles provided narration for the Style Council&#x27;s film &quot;JerUSAlem&quot; in 1987 and also started a career as a writer, particularly with the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; and the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;. He took up religion in his late twenties, after &quot;the best of times, the worst of times&quot;, pop success and the deaths of friends as a result of HIV. From 1991 to 1994 he studied for a BA in theology at King&#x27;s College London. While at university, Coles became a Roman Catholic and remained so for the next ten years before returning to Anglicanism in 2001.

Coles was selected for training for the priesthood in the Church of England and began his training at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, West Yorkshire, in 2003, before being ordained in 2005. After ordination, he was a curate at St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire and then at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge in London. He has been chaplain of the Royal Academy of Music, played Dr Frank N Furter in a local concert and conducted an atheist funeral for Mo Mowlam in 2005.

Coles was an inspiration for the character of Adam Smallbone (played by Tom Hollander) in BBC Two sitcom &quot;Rev.&quot; and was also an advisor to the show. Coles mentions in his book &quot;Fathomless Riches&quot; that he is also the inspiration for the character &quot;Tom&quot; in the Bridget Jones novels. In January 2011, Coles was appointed as the vicar of St Mary the Virgin, Finedon in the Diocese of Peterborough.

Since 2011, Coles has been on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a social enterprise providing housing and community support for the Borough of Wellingborough and, after its name change to Greatwell Homes, became its Patron. In 2012, Coles was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Northampton and also became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2016, he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Warwick. In 2019 he was appointed Honorary Chaplain to the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers.

In July 2017, Coles was elected a Fellow of King&#x27;s College London and separately as Chancellor of the University of Northampton. Coles retired as vicar of Finedon on Low Sunday 2022. Looking back on his time as a &quot;half-time vicar&quot;, he said: How do you do all the things you do?&#x27; I am frequently asked, and the answer is by neglecting important things and disappointing people. I was once called in the middle of the night to attend a parishioner&#x27;s deathbed and I could not because I was in Glasgow doing &quot;Celebrity Antiques Road Trip.&quot; I found someone to cover, but it should have been me.&quot; He explained: &quot;I will still be a priest, I will always be a priest, and I will minister where I am able. Next month I am going to my first conference of prison chaplains and I hope I can make myself useful as a volunteer with inmates in the criminal justice system.&quot;

In April 2022, Coles announced that he retired from parish duties due to the Church of England allegedly increasingly excluding gay couples, and what he described as its &quot;conservative, punchy and fundamentalist&quot; direction.

===Writing===
On 1 November 2012 (All Saints&#x27; Day), Darton, Longman and Todd published Coles&#x27;s book, &quot;Lives of the Improbable Saints&quot;, illustrated by Ted Harrison, a précis of the life stories of nearly 200 lesser-known saints. In the following year Volume two, &quot;Legends of the Improbable Saints&quot;, was published.

In 2014, the first volume of his memoirs, &quot;Fathomless Riches&quot;, was published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (W&amp;N). A follow-up volume, &quot;Bringing in the Sheaves&quot;, was published in 2016.

In June 2022, Coles&#x27;s debut mystery novel &quot;Murder Before Evensong&quot; was released. It is the first in a series about Canon Daniel Clement. The sequel, &quot;A Death In The Parish&quot;, was published on 8 June 2023. 

In 2022, &quot;Murder Before Evensong&quot; was optioned for a television adaptation, with Coles serving as an executive producer. In December 2024, Matthew Lewis was cast as Canon Clement. Filming got underway on the adaptation in February 2025.

In 2023, Coles signed a deal with W&amp;N to write three more Canon Clement books. The first of these, &quot;Murder at the Monastery&quot;, was released in June 2024.

===Broadcasting and media===

Coles still works as a broadcaster, which he describes as &quot;just showing off&quot;, on programmes including &quot;Nightwaves&quot; on BBC Radio 3, which he formerly presented, and &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; on BBC Two. He has appeared on the Radio 4 panel game show &quot;Heresy&quot; twice: first in May 2008 and then in May 2010. 
Coles has appeared seven times as a guest on the topical television news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;: in 1994, May 2009, May 2013, April 2016, June 2017, April 2020 and May 2021. He presented a special edition of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; in January 2010. He was a guest on the Children in Need special of the BBC quiz &quot;Only Connect&quot; in November of the same year. In 2011, he presented a four-part Radio 3 series called &quot;Out in the World: A Global Gay History&quot;.

He regularly guest-hosted the Radio 4 programme &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, while the regular host Fi Glover was on maternity leave from 2008 to 2009. Coles replaced Glover permanently in 2011. On 1 September 2011, he presented a short piece on his home town and parish of Finedon for the Radio 4 programme &quot;You and Yours&quot;. In December 2012, December 2013 and November 2014, Coles appeared as a guest on the BBC comedy quiz show &quot;QI&quot;. In January 2014, he won the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, with his specialist subject being the &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; novels of E. F. Benson. Coles featured as the subject of &quot;Fern Britton Meets...&quot; on BBC1 in December 2014. Since 2014 he has appeared regularly in the &quot;Pause for Thought&quot; slot on Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot;, for which he won a Jerusalem Award in 2014.

In July 2016, Coles appeared on the BBC cooking series &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;, finishing in fifth place. In December 2021, he once again appeared on the programme, this time winning the edition. In February 2017, he co-presented &quot;The Big Painting Challenge&quot; with Mariella Frostrup on BBC1. From September 2017, Coles was a contestant in the 15th series of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing.&quot; He was paired with professional dancer Dianne Buswell. They were the second couple to be eliminated after scoring 14 points for their Paso Doble to the theme from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; – at the time, the lowest scoring Paso Doble in the history of the show.

On 18 December 2017, Coles was a guest panellist on the Christmas special of the eleventh series of BBC1 comedy quiz &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, hosted by Rob Brydon. Coles was captain of a team from the University of Leeds who were series champions on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Christmas 2019 University Challenge&quot;. In December 2020 Coles was featured in the BBC series &quot;Winter Walks&quot;, walking from Sutton Bank to Rievaulx Abbey. He said, &quot;At the centre of what we do in order to be who we are, we need silence, we need retreat, we need contemplation.&quot;

Coles appeared in a January 2021 episode of the BBC Four series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Lost Masterpieces&quot;, discussing the story of the Magi in the gospels, in relation to a portrayal of Balthazar by Joos van Cleve. In August 2022, Coles appeared in the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Good Grief with Reverend Richard Coles&quot;, discovering some of the different ways people deal with bereavement. From 7 to 11 November 2022 Coles guest-hosted Channel 4&#x27;s game show &quot;Countdown&quot; as part of its 40th-anniversary celebrations.

On 22 March 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Coles was disappointed to be leaving the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Saturday Live&quot; programme following that week&#x27;s edition, due to the programme&#x27;s relocation to Cardiff. On 17 May 2024, he was featured on the podcast &quot;Rosebud with Gyles Brandreth&quot;. From 21 November 2024, Coles was a contestant on the 2024 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, coming third.

==Personal life==
Richard Coles first came out as gay to his mother, in 1978, when he was 16. He played her the Tom Robinson Band&#x27;s &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot; four times, before she said &quot;Darling, are you trying to tell me something?&quot; Coles has spoken about the &quot;mental crisis&quot; that he suffered following his coming out, which ultimately led to him attempting suicide and being diagnosed with clinical depression.

Coles suffers from tinnitus in his right ear, the result of his performing loud pop music, which he described in 2020 as sounding &quot;like something from the National Grid kind of powering through your ear ... can be very frustrating.&quot;

In 2007, Coles began a relationship with David Oldham, who was also an Anglican priest. In 2010, the couple entered into a civil partnership (which the Church of England has allowed clergy to do since 2005), with David taking Richard&#x27;s surname. Coles asserted at the time that the relationship was celibate, but later said that this had not been true, but he had to promise celibacy in order to maintain his job as a vicar. David Coles died in December 2019, with Coles stating in 2024 that he died from Alcoholic liver disease. Coles said he had received hate mail saying that his partner is in hell. 

In June 2023, Coles revealed that he was in a relationship with actor Richard Cant. 

Coles&#x27;s elder brother, Andy Coles, a former Metropolitan Police officer, was elected in 2015 as a Conservative councillor in Peterborough and was appointed deputy Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner in 2016. Following a reference to his earlier career as an undercover police officer in Coles&#x27;s 2014 autobiography, he resigned as deputy commissioner over allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a political activist. The relationship was part of a wider UK undercover policing relationships scandal in this period.

Coles is a member of the Labour Party. He is also a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), having become enthusiastic about GAA sports through watching the 2020 TV series &quot;Normal People&quot;. Family ties led to Coles selecting Cork as his county (hurling team/football team) and St Finbarr&#x27;s as his club. The club responded by sending him a membership card.

Coles moved to Friston, East Sussex, in May 2022 to be closer to his friend and former manager Lorna Gradden. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ll be living in a charming 18th-century cottage with a bow window that looms over the street affording a privileged view of my neighbours&#x27; comings and goings, as the scent of lavender floats across the village green.&quot;

==Legal issues==
In 1991, Coles sued accountants Coombes Wales Quinnell, who allegedly had refused to hand over financial records until £30,000 fees were paid.

<text>A metalloproteinase, or metalloprotease, is any protease enzyme whose catalytic mechanism involves a metal. An example is ADAM12 which plays a significant role in the fusion of muscle cells during embryo development, in a process known as myogenesis.

Most metalloproteases require zinc, but some use cobalt. The metal ion is coordinated to the protein via three ligands. The ligands coordinating the metal ion can vary with histidine, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and arginine. The fourth coordination position is taken up by a labile water molecule.

Treatment with chelating agents such as EDTA leads to complete inactivation. EDTA is a metal chelator that removes zinc, which is essential for activity. They are also inhibited by the chelator orthophenanthroline.

==Classification==
There are two subgroups of metalloproteinases:
* Exopeptidases, metalloexopeptidases (EC number: 3.4.17).
* Endopeptidases, metalloendopeptidases (3.4.24). Well known metalloendopeptidases include ADAM proteins and matrix metalloproteinases, and M16 metalloproteinases such as Insulin Degrading Enzyme and Presequence Protease

In the MEROPS database peptidase families are grouped by their catalytic type, the first character representing the catalytic type: A, aspartic; C, cysteine; G, glutamic acid; M, metallo; S, serine; T, threonine; and U, unknown. The serine, threonine and cysteine peptidases utilise the amino acid as a nucleophile and form an acyl intermediate - these peptidases can also readily act as transferases. In the case of aspartic, glutamic and metallopeptidases, the nucleophile is an activated water molecule. In many instances, the structural protein fold that characterises the clan or family may have lost its catalytic activity, yet retained its function in protein recognition and binding.

Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main protease types, with more than 50 families classified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are histidine, glutamate, aspartate or lysine and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophilic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as &#x27;abXHEbbHbc&#x27;, where &#x27;a&#x27; is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1&#x27; subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, &#x27;b&#x27; is an uncharged residue, and &#x27;c&#x27; a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.

Metallopeptidases from family M48 are integral membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, binding one zinc ion per subunit. These endopeptidases include CAAX prenyl protease 1, which proteolytically removes the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins.

Metalloproteinase inhibitors are found in numerous marine organisms, including fish, cephalopods, mollusks, algae and bacteria.

Members of the M50 metallopeptidase family include: mammalian sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) site 2 protease and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; protease EcfE, stage IV sporulation protein FB.

<text>Endopeptidase or endoproteinase are proteolytic peptidases that break peptide bonds of nonterminal amino acids (i.e. within the molecule), in contrast to exopeptidases, which break peptide bonds from end-pieces of terminal amino acids. For this reason, endopeptidases cannot break down peptides into monomers, while exopeptidases can break down proteins into monomers. A particular case of endopeptidase is the oligopeptidase, whose substrates are oligopeptides instead of proteins.

They are usually very specific for certain amino acids. Examples of endopeptidases include:
* Trypsin - cuts after Arg or Lys, unless followed by Pro. Very strict. Works best at pH 8.
* Chymotrypsin - cuts after Phe, Trp, or Tyr, unless followed by Pro. Cuts more slowly after His, Met or Leu. Works best at pH 8.
* Elastase - cuts after Ala, Gly, Ser, or Val, unless followed by Pro.
* Thermolysin - cuts &quot;before&quot; Ile, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, or Val, unless &quot;preceded&quot; by Pro. Sometimes cuts after Ala, Asp, His or Thr. Heat stable.
* Pepsin - cuts &quot;before&quot; Leu, Phe, Trp or Tyr, unless &quot;preceded&quot; by Pro. Also others, quite nonspecific; works best at pH 2.
* Glutamyl endopeptidase - cuts after Glu. Works best at pH 8.
* Neprilysin

<text>The A9 is a route designation of the outer western Sydney Bypass, connecting Windsor to Campbelltown via Penrith. This name covers a few consecutive roads and is widely known to most drivers, but the entire allocation is also known – and signposted – by the names of its constituent parts: Macquarie Street, George Street, The Northern Road, Richmond Road, Parker Street and Narellan Road.

==Route==
The A9 commences at the intersection of Macquarie Street and Bridge Street in Windsor and heads in a southwesterly direction as Macquarie Street as a four-lane, single carriageway road, narrowing to two lanes through South Windsor, and then intersects with and changes name to George Street shortly afterwards, eventually meeting Blacktown Road at a roundabout at Londonderry. It runs briefly southeast along Blacktown Road, before following The Northern Road at another roundabout, heading again in a southwesterly direction, before heading south at Llandilo. It changes name to Richmond Road and widens to a four-lane, dual carriageway road at Cranebrook and continues south, changing name again to Parker Street in Penrith, before meeting Great Western Highway a short distance later and widening to a six-lane, dual-carriageway road. Parker Street continues south, changing name back to The Northern Road in South Penrith, crosses M4 Western Motorway, narrows back to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road, and continues in a southerly direction through Bringelly to eventually meet Camden Valley Way at Narellan. It changes name one final time to Narellan Road and heads southeast, before eventually terminating at the interchange with Hume Motorway on the northern fringes of Campbelltown.

The A9 is also the major link between the International Regatta Centre at Cranebrook and M4 Western Motorway. It was upgraded just before the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 154 was declared from the intersection with Hume Highway (today Camden Valley Way) in Narellan, via Bringelly and Luddenham to Llandilo (and continuing northwards to the intersection with Windsor Street in Richmond), Main Road No. 178 was declared between Narellan and Campbelltown, and Main Road No. 184 was declared along Macquarie Street, between Richmond and Windsor Roads, through Windsor, on the same day, 8 August 1928; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Main Roads 154 and 178 and 184 on 8 April 1929. The northern end of Main Road 154 between Llandilo and Richmond was later re-aligned to run from Llandilo to Windsor on 8 December 1937.

Main Road 154, previously named Bringelly Road, was later renamed The Northern Road (between Blacktown Road in South Windsor and the intersection with Andrews and Richmond Roads in Penrith, and the intersection of Maxwell and Parker Streets in South Penrith to the intersection of Hume Highway – today Camden Valley Way – and Narellan Road in Narellan) on 14 January 1981.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the A9 retains its declaration as Main Roads 154 (as Macquarie and George Streets and The Northern Road) and 178 (as Narellan Road), and part of Main Road 184 (Macquarie Street through Windsor).

The route was allocated part of State Route 69 in 1973, linking to via Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs, along Putty Road, the current A9 route, and Appin Road. It was replaced by Metroad 9 between Windsor and Campbelltown in December 1998, with State Route 69 consequently split into two sections: a northern section along Putty Road connecting Windsor to Singleton, and a southern section along Appin Road connecting Campbelltown to Wollongong via Princes Motorway.

With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, Metroad 9 was replaced by route A9, and the southern section of State Route 69 (Appin Road) was replaced by route B69; the northern section of State Route 69 (Putty Road) was left unallocated.

===Road upgrade===

As part of the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, of The Northern Road will be upgraded to a minimum of four lanes between The Old Northern Road at Narellan and Jamison Road at South Penrith. The project is being delivered in six stages, with the first stage at Oran Park completed in April 2018. In April 2020, The Northern Road was also realigned between Mersey Road and Eaton Road at Luddenham, to facilitate the construction of Western Sydney Airport. On 16 July 2020, The Northern Road and Bringelly Road interchange opened including a realignment of The Northern Road. On 13 December 2020, The Northern Road was realigned between Elizabeth Drive and Eaton Road was opened to traffic, bypassing Luddenham. The rest of The Northern Road upgrade was completed through 2021, with the final upgrade opened to traffic in December 2021.

===Future replacement===

As part of economic development of western Sydney, including the construction of the Western Sydney Airport at , the road was proposed to be upgraded to a grade separated motorway. The proposal, known as the M9 Outer-Western Sydney Orbital motorway, would link the M31 near Appin with the Central Coast via , and .

As part of the State Budget 2014–15, the NSW Government announced a $5.5 billion road package for Western Sydney. It includes $4.6 million for planning the M9 Motorway. The preferred corridor for the motorway was expected to be announced later in 2014 before plans are made for reserving land. The corridor is now known as Outer Sydney Orbital with motorway codenames as either M9 or M10.

<text>Châteauroux ( ; ; ) is the capital city of the French department of Indre, central France and the second-largest town in the province of Berry, after Bourges. Its residents are called &quot;Castelroussins&quot; () in French.

==Climate==
Châteauroux temperatures range from an average January low of to an average August high of .

==History==
The old town, close to the river, forms a nucleus around which a newer and more extensive quarter, bordered by boulevards, has grown up. The suburbs of St. Christophe and Déols lie on the right bank of the Indre. The castle from which the city takes its name was built in the latter part of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of Déols.

From 920 to 1008, the Norman raids forced the monks of the abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, founded in Brittany by Saint Gildas, to bring his relics to the abbey of Saint-Gildas of Châteauroux that they founded under the protection of the prince Ebbes of Déols, father of Raoul. During the Middle Ages, it was the seat of a seigniory. It was passed to the Chauvigny from 1207 to 1473. It was raised to the rank of countship in 1497 for Jean V d&#x27;Aumont.

In 1616, when it was held by Henry II, Prince of Condé, it was raised to the rank of duchy. In 1736, it returned to the crown. It was given to Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess of Châteauroux, by Louis XV in 1744. The present housing the &quot;préfecture&quot; offices dates from the 15th century.

<doc id="984406" wikidata="Q655363" url="?curid=984406" title="Jacareí">
<text>Jacareí () is a city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 235,416 (2020 est.) in an area of 464.27 km2. The city is known as &quot;Capital of Beer&quot; by the daily output of its factories, considered the biggest in Latin America. The economic activity is mainly based on industrial production. The industries produce mainly paper, chemicals, glass, wire, and rubber.

Its neighboring municipalities are: São José dos Campos to the north and northeast; Jambeiro to the east; Santa Branca to the southeast; Guararema to the southwest; Santa Isabel to the west and Igaratá to the northwest.

==Geography==
===Location===

Jacareí is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte.
The city is located in the Paraíba do Sul&#x27;s valley (the Paraíba do Sul is the most important river in the east of the state). This region is highly industrialized, located between the cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

Neighbor Cities: São José dos Campos, Santa Branca, Guararema, Jambeiro, Igaratá and Santa Isabel.

==History==

Jacareí was formed on land that belonged to Mogi das Cruzes. It was founded by Antonio Afonso and his sons in 1652. They built a chapel in honor of Our Lady of Conception. With the help of peaceful Indians, the village prospered. In 1653, was elevated as a town and in 1849, as a city.
Paraibuna (on December 7, 1812), Santa Branca (on February 20, 1841) and São José dos Campos (unknown date) were incorporated into the municipality of Jacareí. They were later dismembered: Sao José do Campos in 1767, Paraibuna in 1832 and Santa Branca in 1856.
With the coffee cycle, the city begins to have paving, new roads and leisure activities, with a small population growth. It was one of the most important cities of the coffee cycle. At this time (late nineteenth century), industries were beginning to emerge, starting with the socks and the factory &quot;Biscoutos Jacareí&quot; (Jacareí&#x27;s cookies), taking a leap of development in the twentieth century.

==Etimology==
The origin of the name Jacareí is not known but there are two hypotheses.

Contains in the archives of the municipality that, in the past, the lakes and the Paraiba do Sul river relied on large numbers of alligators. In a fraternization, held on the river bank near the pond, a component of the group who was having fun next to the river, watching the large number of alligators made an observation: &quot;Jacaré, iih&quot; (&quot;alligator, iih&quot;). It was the simple interjection that, connected to the alligator, resulted in Jacareí.

The second hypothesis is that the word came from a native Brazilian language (Tupi language) &quot;Icare-ig&quot; that means &quot;river of alligators&quot;.

<doc id="984433" wikidata="Q424952" url="?curid=984433" title="Nadolol">
<text>Nadolol, sold under the brand name Corgard among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart pain, atrial fibrillation, and some inherited arrhythmic syndromes. It has also been used to prevent migraine headaches and complications of cirrhosis. It is taken orally.
Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, a slow heart rate, and Raynaud syndrome. Serious side effects may include heart failure and bronchospasm. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is a non-selective beta blocker and works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and β2-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels.
Nadolol was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 340th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700thousand prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Nadolol is used to treat hypertension and for long-term treatment of angina pectoris and is approved by the FDA for these purposes.

It is regularly used off-label for control of heart rate in people with atrial fibrillation, prevention of migraine headaches; prevention of bleeding veins in people with portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis; and to treat people with high levels of thyroid hormone.

Nadolol is the preferred beta-blocker in the management of patients with LQTS for prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. It is more efficacious than selective beta blockers or propranolol in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events. Similarly, it is the preferred type of beta blocker for treatment of patients with CPVT, as it has been shown to be more efficacious than selective beta blockers, like atenolol or bisoprolol.

Nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. For patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. It has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson&#x27;s disease but neither is well established.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include dizziness and fatigue.

==Contraindications==
Nadolol and other beta blockers should be used with cautions in people with heart failure and its use should not be abruptly stopped. It is contraindicated for people with asthma, a slow heart rate and certain severe heart problems.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it non-selectively blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. It has a preference for beta-1 receptors, which are predominantly located in the heart, thereby inhibiting the effects of catecholamines and causing a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Its inhibition of beta-2 receptors, which are mainly located in the bronchial smooth muscle of the airways, leads to airway constriction similar to that seen in asthma. Inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney inhibits the renin–angiotensin system, causing a decrease in vasoconstriction and a decrease in water retention. Nadolol&#x27;s inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the heart and kidney leads to its effects on lowering blood pressure.

The drug impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate.

Nadolol may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. 

===Pharmacokinetics===
Nadolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as fewer neuropsychiatric side effects.

==Chemistry==
Nadolol is a mixture of stereoisomers. It is polar and hydrophilic, with low lipid solubility.

<doc id="984446" wikidata="Q1481436" url="?curid=984446" title="County of Foix">
<text>The County of Foix (, ; , ; , ) was a medieval fief in southern France, and later a province of France, whose territory corresponded roughly the eastern part of the modern &quot;département&quot; of Ariège (the western part of Ariège being Couserans).

During the Middle Ages, the county of Foix was ruled by the counts of Foix, whose castle overlooks the town of Foix. In 1290 the counts of Foix acquired the viscountcy Béarn, which became the center of their domain, and from that time on the counts of Foix rarely resided in the county of Foix, preferring the richer and more verdant Béarn.

The county of Foix was an autonomous fief of the kingdom of France and consisted of an agglomeration of small holdings ruled by lords, who, though subordinate to the counts of Foix, had some voice in the government of the county.

The provincial estates of the county, a legislative body that can be traced back to the 14th century, consisted of three orders and possessed considerable power and energy. In the 17th and 18th centuries Foix formed one of the thirty-three , or military areas, of France and kept its provincial estates until the French Revolution. In 1790 it was joined with Couserans to form the of Ariège.

The county of Foix, as it existed just before the French Revolution, had a land area of 2,466 km2 (952 sq. miles).

At the 1999 census there were 76,809 inhabitants living on the territory of the former province of the county of Foix, which means a density of only 32 inh. per km2 (84 inh. per sq. miles). The largest urban areas are Pamiers, with 17,715 inhabitants in 1999, and Foix, with 10,378 inhabitants in 1999.

==History==
===House of Foix===

The Counts of Foix flourished from the 11th to the 15th century. They were at first feudatories of the counts of Toulouse and the counts of Barcelona, but after the latter&#x27;s defeat in the Cathar Crusade they succeeded in establishing their direct vassalage to the king of France.

During the 13th and 14th centuries the counts of Foix figured among the most powerful of the French feudal nobles. Living on the borders of France, having constant interaction with the Kingdom of Navarre, and in frequent communication with England through Gascony and Aquitaine, they were in a position favorable to an assertion of independence, and acted more like the equals than the dependents of the kings of France.

The title of count of Foix was first assumed by Roger of Foix (died ca. 1064), son of Bernard-Roger of Couserans, who was a younger son of Roger I de Cominges, Count of Carcassonne, de Couserans et de Razés, when he inherited the town of Foix and the adjoining lands, which had hitherto formed part of the county of Carcassonne.

His grandson, Roger II, took part in the First Crusade in 1095 and was afterwards excommunicated by Pope Paschal II for seizing ecclesiastical property. Subsequently, he appeased the anger of the church through rich donations, and when he died in 1125 he was succeeded by his son, Roger III, and his son, Roger Bernard I.

Roger-Bernard&#x27;s only son, Raymond Roger, accompanied the French king, Philip Augustus, to Palestine in 1190 and distinguished himself at the capture of Acre. He was afterwards engaged in the Albigensian Crusade defending the Cathars, and, on being accused of heresy, his lands were given to Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester. Raymond Roger came to terms with the Church and recovered his estates before his death in 1223. He was a patron of the Provençal poets and a poet himself.

He was succeeded by his son, Roger Bernard II the Great, who assisted Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, and the Albigenses in their resistance to the French kings, Louis VIII and Louis IX, was excommunicated on two occasions, and died in 1241.

His son, Roger IV, died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son, Roger Bernard III who, more famous as a poet than as a warrior, was taken prisoner both by Philip III of France and by Peter III of Aragon. He married Marguerite, daughter and heiress of Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn, and he inherited Béarn and Nébouzan from his father-in-law in 1290, which led to the outbreak of a long feud between the Houses of Foix and Armagnac.

From 1278 the counts of Foix, and their legal successors, have also been Co-princes of Andorra.

===House of Foix-Béarn===
The quarrel was continued under Roger Bernard&#x27;s son and successor, Gaston I, who became count in 1302, inheriting both Foix and Béarn. Becoming embroiled with the French king, Philip IV, in consequence of the struggle with the count of Armagnac, Gaston was imprisoned in Paris. He quickly regained his freedom and accompanied King Louis X on an expedition into Flanders in 1315, and died on his return to France in the same year.

His eldest son, Gaston II, made peace with the house of Armagnac and took part in various wars both in France and Spain, dying at Seville in 1343, when he was succeeded by his young son, Gaston III.

Gaston III (1331–1391), called Phoebus, the Latin version of Apollo, on account of his beauty, was the most famous member of the House of Foix-Béarn. Like his father he assisted France in her struggle against England, being entrusted with the defence of the frontiers of Gascony.

When the French king, John II, favored the count of Armagnac, Gaston left his service and went to fight against the pagans of Prussia. Returning to France around 1357, he delivered some noble ladies from the attacks of the adherents of the Jacquerie at Meaux, and was soon at war with the count of Armagnac.

During this struggle he also attacked the count of Poitiers, the royal representative in Languedoc, but owing to the intervention of Pope Innocent VI he made peace with the count in 1360. Gaston, however, continued to fight against the count of Armagnac, who, in 1362, was defeated and compelled to pay a ransom. This war lasted until 1377.

Early in 1380, the count was appointed governor of Languedoc, but when Charles VI succeeded Charles V as king later in the same year, this appointment was cancelled. Refusing, however, to heed the royal command, and supported by the communes of Languedoc, Gaston fought for about two years against John, duke of Berry, who had been chosen as his successor.

When he was bested in the combat, he abandoned the struggle and retired to his estates, remaining neutral and independent. He then resided in Orthez, the capital of Béarn. In 1348 Gaston married Agnes, daughter of Philip, Count of Evreux (d. 1343), by his wife Jeanne II, queen of Navarre. By Agnes, whom he divorced in 1373, he had an only son, Gaston, who is said to have been incited by his uncle, Charles II of Navarre, to poison his father, and who met his death in 1381. It is probable that he was killed by his father; this is the account presented by Froissart.

Gaston was very fond of hunting, but was not without a taste for art and literature. Several beautiful manuscripts are in existence which were executed by his orders, and he himself wrote a treatise on hunting, the &quot;Livre de chasse&quot;, known in English as &quot;The Hunting Book&quot;. Froissart, who gives a graphic description of his court and his manner of life at Orthez in Béarn, speaks enthusiastically of Gaston, saying: &quot;I never saw one like him of personage, nor of so fair form, nor so well made, and again, in everything he was so perfect that he cannot be praised too much&quot;.

Left without legitimate sons, Gaston de Foix was easily persuaded to bequeath his lands to King Charles VI, who thus obtained Foix and Béarn when the count died at Orthez in 1391. Almost immediately after Gaston&#x27;s death Charles granted the county of Foix to Matthew, Viscount of Castelbon, a descendant of Count Gaston I of Foix. When Matthew died without issue in 1398, his lands were seized by Archambault, Count of Grailly and Captal de Buch, the husband of Matthew&#x27;s sister Isabella (d. 1426), who was confirmed as legitimate count of Foix in 1401.

===House of Foix-Grailly===

Archambault&#x27;s eldest son, John (&quot;ca.&quot; 1382–1436), who succeeded to his father&#x27;s lands and titles in 1412, had married Jeanne in 1402, daughter of Charles III, king of Navarre. Having served the king of France in Guyenne and the king of Aragon in Sardinia, John became the royal representative in Languedoc, when the old quarrel between Foix and Armagnac broke out again. During the struggle between the Burgundian party and the Armagnacs, he intrigued with both, and consequently was distrusted by the &quot;Dauphin&quot;, afterwards King Charles VII. Deserting the French cause, he then allied himself with Henry V of England. When Charles VII became king in 1423, he returned to his former allegiance and became the king&#x27;s representative in Languedoc and Guyenne. He then assisted in suppressing the marauding bands which were devastating France, fought for Aragon against Castile, and aided his brother, the cardinal of Foix, to crush an insurgency in Aragon.

Peter, cardinal of Foix (1386–1464), was the fifth son of Archambault of Grailly, and was made archbishop of Arles in 1450. He took a prominent part in the struggle between the rival popes, and founded and endowed the Collège de Foix at Toulouse. The next count was John&#x27;s son, Gaston IV of Foix, who married Leonora (died 1479), a daughter of John, king of Aragon and Navarre. In 1447 he bought the viscounty of Narbonne, and having assisted King Charles VII in Guyenne, he was made a peer of France in 1458. In 1455 his father-in-law designated him as his successor in Navarre, and Louis XI of France gave him the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne, and made him his representative in Languedoc and Guyenne; but these marks of favor did not prevent him from joining a league against Louis in 1471.

His eldest son, Gaston, the husband of Madeleine, a daughter of Charles VII of France, died in 1470, and when Gaston IV died two years later, his lands descended to his grandson, Francis Phoebus (died 1483). Francis Phoebus became king of Navarre in 1479 and was succeeded by his sister Catherine (died 1517), the wife of Jean d&#x27;Albret (d. 1516).

A younger son of Count Gaston IV was John (died 1500), who received the viscounty of Narbonne from his father and married Marie, a sister of the French king Louis XII. He was on good terms both with Louis XI and Louis XII, and on the death of his nephew Francis Phoebus in 1483, claimed the kingdom of Navarre against Jean d&#x27;Albret and his wife, Catherine de Foix. The ensuing struggle lasted until 1497 when John renounced his claim. He left a son, Gaston de Foix (1489–1512), a distinguished French general, and a daughter, Germaine de Foix, who became the second wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon.

In 1507, Gaston exchanged his viscounty of Narbonne with King Louis XII of France for the duchy of Nemours, and as duke of Nemours he took command of the French troops in Italy. After delivering Bologna and taking Brescia, Gaston encountered the troops of the Holy League at Ravenna in April 1512 and routed the enemy, but was killed during the pursuit.

There were also younger branches of the house of Foix-Grailly: the viscounts of Lautrec (descended from Pierre de Foix, younger son of Jean III); the Counts of Candale and Benauges (descended from Gaston de Foix, a younger son of Archemboult and his son John de Foix, 1st Earl of Kendal); the Counts of Gurson and Fleix and Viscounts of Meille (Jean de Foix, Comte de Meille, Gurson et Fleix, was a younger son of Jean de Foix, Earl of Kendal), and the Counts of Caraman, or Carmain, descended from Isabeau de Foix, Dame de Navailles (only child of Archambaud de Foix-Grailly, Baron de Navailles) and her husband Jean, Vicomte de Carmain, whose descendants adopted the name and arms of Foix.

===Houses of Albret and the House of Bourbon===

When Catherine, wife of Jean d&#x27;Albret, succeeded her brother Francis Phoebus, the House of Foix-Grailly was merged into that of Albret, and later into that of Bourbon with Henry III of Navarre, son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d&#x27;Albret.

Henry III of Navarre became King Henry IV of France in 1589. In 1607, he united to the French crown his personal fiefs that were under French sovereignty (i.e. County of Foix, Bigorre, Quatre-Vallées, and Nébouzan, but not Béarn and Lower Navarre, which were sovereign countries outside of the kingdom of France), and so the county of Foix became part of the royal domain.

<text>Vanity Fair is a 1932 American pre-Code drama film directed by Chester M. Franklin and starring Myrna Loy, Conway Tearle and Anthony Bushell. The film is modernized adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1848 novel of the same name with the original Regency-era story reset in Twentieth Century Britain. Three years later Thackeray&#x27;s novel was adapted again as &quot;Becky Sharp&quot;, the first three-strip technicolor film.

==Plot==

This film adaptation&#x27;s storyline begins around 1920 and concludes in 1933. In its opening scene a limousine is traveling down a road outside London. In the car are two passengers, Amelia Sedley (Barbara Kent) and her friend Becky Sharp (Myrna Loy), young ladies who agewise are in their twenties. Amelia is from a rich, well-connected family, while Becky is from very modest means and has no family at all. Given Becky&#x27;s circumstances, Amelia has invited her to her home for the Christmas holidays.

At the Sedley estate Amelia&#x27;s family welcomes their guest, but the mother is soon wary of her. Those suspicions are warranted, for Becky aims to use her beauty and guile to gain wealth and privilege by climbing England&#x27;s social ladder. Her first target for achieving those goals is Joseph, Amelia&#x27;s much-older brother (Billy Bevan). After Becky tries unsuccessfully to trap him into marriage, Mrs. Sedley sees her cuddling in the home&#x27;s drawing room with her daughter&#x27;s fiancé, George Osborne. Disgusted, the mother calls &quot;Miss Sharp&quot; into the adjoining room, where she advises Becky to leave immediately so she can begin the job she had accepted before the holidays, that of governess for the family of Sir Pitt Crawley. Becky heeds the thinly veiled advice and departs.

Upon her arrival at the residence of Lord Crawley, Becky quickly stirs the passions of both the elderly Sir Pitt and his son Rawdon (Conway Tearle). The new governess entices them with her suggestive comments and by allowing each man into her bedroom at night while she glides about in her satin pajamas. Soon she and Rawdon begin a secretive affair, but Sir Pitt finally catches them together in Becky&#x27;s bedroom. There they inform him they had married the previous day. That news enrages the old man, who orders his son and his &quot;shameless little hussy&quot; out of his house.

Relocating to a townhouse in London&#x27;s Mayfair district, Becky and Rawdon feel the financial strains of being cut off from Lord Crawley and his wealth. The couple at first brings in money by betting and cheating their friends playing bridge. That income, however, is insufficient for their mounting bills, so Becky schemes to find other ways to get money. She does so through blackmail and by obtaining gifts from a string of lovers, including George Osborne, now the husband of her friend Amelia. Eventually, even Rawdon cannot tolerate his wife&#x27;s wanton, criminal behavior. On the evening he is released from police custody for writing bad checks, Rawdon finds Becky at their home with another lover. He declares their marriage is over and gives her only ten minutes to vacate the premises. As she leaves, he informs Becky that his father had just died, and he is now the new Lord Crawley. He then warns her that if she ever dares to refer to herself as &quot;Lady Crawley,&quot; he will track her down and kill her.

Several years pass and Becky lives in a far less affluent, largely French-speaking area of London. There she prowls the area&#x27;s bars and casinos, getting money from the assorted men she meets. One evening in a casino, she sees Amelia&#x27;s brother Joseph, who updates her about his sister&#x27;s situation. While Becky already knows that Amelia&#x27;s husband George had died five years earlier in a horse-riding accident, she learns from Joseph that Amelia still refuses to remarry. Subsequently she also learns that her friend&#x27;s devotion to George&#x27;s memory and her mistaken belief in his fidelity have led Amelia to refuse repeated marriage proposals from Dobbin, a gentleman who has adored her for years. Sometime later, Becky invites Amelia to her apartment and confesses her affair with George. She then calls Amelia a fool for revering a dead &quot;cad&quot; and urges her to wed Dobbin, who is waiting outside in a car. When Amelia rejoins him after Becky&#x27;s disclosures, she rests her head on Dobbin&#x27;s shoulder, implying that his next proposal will be accepted.

The film sequence that follows shows the passage of more years and the ongoing disintegration of Becky&#x27;s life, which has become a daily struggle marked by petty crimes, prostitution, and meager funds. In the final scene Becky enters her shabby one-room apartment. Lying on the bed is Joseph, stirring from his latest binge. She addresses him as &quot;my love&quot; and informs him that his sister had just given her another check. He is infuriated and tells her never to accept money again from Amelia. Becky turns, sits at a dresser, and stares into its mirror. In the reflection she watches her face transform from the reality of its present haggard appearance to its former beauty. She then notices that Joseph has quietly departed. She also notices on a small bedside bureau that he has torn up his sister&#x27;s check, and in the dust that coats the bureau&#x27;s surface he has written &quot;Finis&quot; (&quot;The End&quot;). The film concludes with Becky lowering her face into her hands and weeping.

==Reception==
&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; received largely negative reviews in 1932 from some of the film industry&#x27;s leading trade publications. The critic for &quot;Variety&quot; could not recommend the film, finding its acting &quot;competent&quot; but the overall production poorly scripted and its direction deficient:

&quot;The Film Daily&quot; was even more critical of the film than &quot;Variety&quot;. The subheading of its review summarized the film as being a &quot;Dull Drama&quot; and an &quot;Uninteresting Adaptation of Classic Novel That Falls Flat&quot;. The influential publication found Conway Tearle&#x27;s performance to be the only aspect of the production that was truly noteworthy:

<text>Joaquín Pedraja Reyes (known professionally as Joaquín Cortés; born 1969) is a Spanish classically trained ballet and flamenco dancer.

==Biography==
Cortes was born to a Gitano family in Córdoba, Cortés showed interest in dancing from an early age. Cortés and his family moved to Madrid in 1981. Soon after moving to Madrid, he began to take formal dancing lessons and studying seriously.

In 1984, he was accepted as a member of Spanish prestigious national ballet company. He traveled the world with the Spanish National Ballet, performing in important venues such as the Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center) of New York and the Kremlin Palace in Moscow. During his stint with the Spanish National Ballet, he also became a principal solo performer known for his phenomenal stamina and athleticism.
Desiring more creative control, Cortés formed the Joaquín Cortés Flamenco Ballet company and launched his first international tour &#x27;Cibayí&#x27;, with other artists such as Antón Jiménez as guitarist, in 1992.The formation of Cortés&#x27; own company allowed him to diverge from purist ballet and create his own fusion of flamenco, ballet and modern dance. In 1995, in addition to being featured in two international films- &#x27;La flor de mi secreto&#x27; (The Flower of My Secret) and Carlos Saura&#x27;s &#x27;Flamenco&#x27;, Joaquín Cortés embarked on what is often considered his most successful venture, &#x27;Pasión Gitana&#x27; (Gypsy Passion). &#x27;Pasión Gitana&#x27; marked the beginning of Cortés&#x27; recognition for not only his prowess as a dancer, but also as a choreographer and artistic director. In 1999 Cortés was the subject of a documentary film and he launched a successful tour of &#x27;Soul&#x27; across North and South America. In the 1990s Joaquín Cortés gained notoriety for his close relationships with high-profile celebrities such as Naomi Campbell, Giorgio Armani and Mira Sorvino.

Continuing into the millennium, Cortés&#x27; focus shifted from dancing to choreography and artistic direction. He continues to dance in a limited capacity live on stage, in film and television. In 2000, landed a role in the film &#x27;Gitano&#x27; (Gypsy) and again in 2004 in &#x27;Vaniglia e cioccolato&#x27; (Vanilla and Chocolate). In 2001, he also made a guest appearance on Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s concert in Puerto Rico. In 2004, Cortés was involved in the international tour of &#x27;De Amor y Odio&#x27; that took him to England, Portugal, Thailand and New York, among other places. 2007 marked the beginning of Joaquín Cortés most recent spectacle, &#x27;Mi Soledad.&#x27; On 15 May 2007 he performed as a guest dancer in a high-profile semi-final segment on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot;

Cortes is also the visual inspiration for the character Vamp from the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; video game series.

<doc id="984468" wikidata="Q2581598" url="?curid=984468" title="Zevulun Orlev">
<text>Zevulun Orlev (, born 9 November 1945) is an Israeli politician and a former Knesset member, Minister of Welfare &amp; Social Services and leader of the National Religious Party. Orlev is a decorated war hero who received the Medal of Distinguished Service in the Yom Kippur War.

==Biography==
Zvulun Orlev was born in Rehovot during the Mandate era. He studied humanities and social sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and then trained to be a teacher at Moreshet Yaakov College. Orlev lives in Jerusalem&#x27;s Givat Mordechai neighborhood with his wife, Nira. They have four children.

==Military career==
During his national service in the Israel Defense Forces, he reached the rank of Sergeant. Orlev fought in the Six-Day War, participating in the capture of East Jerusalem. He sustained a knee injury and underwent rehabilitation for two years. During the Yom Kippur War, Orlev served in a stronghold on the Bar-Lev Line. During the Egyptian attack on the first day of the war, Orlev took charge of the soldiers in his outpost after the commander was wounded. Under his command, his unit repelled Egyptian attempts to capture the position, and he organized the evacuation from the stronghold. For this, he was awarded a Medal of Distinguished Service. He later served as a reservist during the 1982 Lebanon War.

==Public service==
Orlev worked as Director General of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Director General of the Ministry of Education and Culture.

==Political career==
He was first elected to the Knesset in the 1999 elections on the National Religious Party list. After being re-elected in the 2003 elections, Orlev was appointed Minister of Welfare and Social Services in Ariel Sharon&#x27;s government. During the crisis in the party over the Gaza disengagement plan, Orlev led the camp which believed staying in the government, rather than leaving the coalition, was the best option. In response, NRP leader Effi Eitam called Orlev a &quot;Meimadnik&quot;. When Eitam and Yitzhak Levy quit the government in 2004, Orlev and many NRP members refused to leave the coalition. Orlev then succeeded in taking control of the party, resulting in Eitam and Levy leaving to form the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party (later renamed Ahi), which would later join the National Union.

Orlev was re-elected in the 2006 elections. Prior to the 2009 elections the NRP was dissolved and its members joined the Jewish Home. Orlev won second place on the new party&#x27;s list, and retained his seat in the subsequent elections.

In 2009 Orlev sponsored a Private member&#x27;s bill that called for a years imprisonment for any person who denied Israel to be a Jewish and democratic state, a law that would have criminalized calls by members of the Arab minority for Israel to be a state for all its citizens. The bill was castigated as racist and discriminatory, and a media outcry following the bill passing its first reading in the Knesset led to the bill ultimately being defeated. The bill was criticized as an exercise in thought police and as being an assault on freedom of speech, and called &quot;racist and fascist&quot; by the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel. The Mossawa Center described the bill as &quot;discriminatory and racist&quot;. Uri Avnery placed the bill in the context as being one in a series of racist laws, writing that it &quot;does not stand out at all in today’s political landscape&quot;, describing Orlev&#x27;s Jewish Home party as &quot;ultra-ultra-ultra racist&quot; and trying to outdo the other right-wing parties.

Orlev was criticized for proposing a bill that would mandate divorced fathers to pay child support until their children reached age 22, though he later retracted and stated he would not pursue the bill.

In 2012, he called for the Third Temple to be built in Jerusalem, as well as legislation to protect the project from prosecution and the &quot;hostile, secular, left-wing media&quot;. He also proposed a Private Members Bill to override an Israeli Supreme Court ruling ordering the demolition five buildings in an Israeli settlement.

Orlev announced that he would retire from politics after he ran unsuccessfully in the 2012 The Jewish Home leadership election. Orlev did not run in the 2013 elections.

He is a co-president of the international Mizrachi movement, which the National Religious Party and its successor Jewish Home represents in the political arena.

<text>ZMA (zinc monomethionine aspartate, magnesium aspartate and vitamin B6) is a supplement marketed towards athletes, gymnasts, and bodybuilders. It was developed by Victor Conte (founder of BALCO Laboratories in Burlingame, California).

==Formula==
The ZMA formula is composed of zinc monomethionine aspartate (30 mg), magnesium aspartate (450 mg), and vitamin B6 as pyridoxine hydrochloride (10.5 mg). The manufacturer recommends that ZMA be taken 30 – 60 minutes before bedtime with an empty stomach to help synchronize absorption with sleep. The product should not be taken with foods or supplements containing calcium because calcium blocks the absorption of zinc.

While ZMA is a registered trademark of SNAC Nutrition, a subsidiary of SNAC System Inc., ZMA is not a patented formula and other manufacturers can produce supplements using a similar formula. Variations on the formula include ZMA-5 (ZMA formula with 5-Hydroxytryptophan), marketed as a sleep enhancer, and ZMA Nightcap, marketed as anabolic mineral support. Like all 5-HTP-containing supplements, serotonin levels may be increased- affecting sleep, appetite and temperature. 

==Scientific studies==
A 1998 study was performed on NCAA football players during an 8-week spring training program. Those who took the ZMA capsules experienced greater increases in muscle strength. However, the study was funded by SNAC Systems Inc, which controls the trademark for ZMA. One of the study&#x27;s authors, Victor Conte, has ownership equity in SNAC System Inc.

In 2004, supplement company Cytodyne funded a study on 42 resistance-trained males using a product called Z-Mass PM that contained ZMA and additional ingredients Mucuna pruriens and polypodium vulgare. The study found that Z-Mass PM supplementation had no significant effects on total and free testosterone, IGF-1, growth hormone, cortisol, the ratio of cortisol to testosterone, or muscle and liver enzymes in response to training. No significant effects were observed in changes in strength, upper or lower body muscle endurance, or anaerobic sprint capacity.

In another study done in 2006, a team of German scientists measured the effect of ZMA on testosterone levels. The study found that ZMA altered urine color due to increased secretion of zinc. It found no effect on testosterone levels.

<text>The Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics () is a research institute specializing in computational mathematics. It was established to solve computational tasks related to government programs of nuclear and fusion energy, space research and missile technology. The Institute is a part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The main direction of activity of the institute is the use of computer technology to solve complex scientific and technical issues of practical importance. Since 2016, the development of mathematical and computational methods for biological research, as well as a direct solution to the problems of computational biology with the use of such methods, has also been included in the circle of scientific activities of the institute.

==Scientific activity==

===Nuclear physics===
Theoretical physicist Yakov Borisovich Zel&#x27;dovich headed one of the departments placed in charge of the theoretical aspects of the work on the creation of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. Alexander Andreevich Samarskii performed the first realistic calculations of macrokinetics of chain reaction of a nuclear explosion, which led to the practical importance estimated power of nuclear weapons. In relation to nuclear energy, the institute was also involved in modelling of processes of neutron transport and nuclear reactions. In particular, E. Kuznetsov is known for his work on the theory of nuclear reactors.

Currently, such work in KIAM is continuing in the field of plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear fusion, which began under the leadership of S. P. Kurdyumov, , .

===Cosmonautics===
D. E. Okhotsimsky directed the works in the department created for research of the dynamics of space flight. In 1966, the department was reorganized into the Ballistic Centre. The Ballistic Centre was involved in the calculations of optimal orbit trajectory and actual corrections for all space flights, from uncrewed interplanetary and lunar vehicles to the crewed &quot;Soyuz&quot; and orbital station &quot;Salyut&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot;. The institute took an active part in the creation of the Soviet space shuttle &quot;Buran&quot;.

KIAM continues to engage in Russian space projects. Current research is connected with:
* development of systems for management and navigation of space vehicles in real time with the use of global satellite navigation systems GPS and GLONASS;
* exploration of prospects for further interplanetary missions using electric rocket engines; 
* participation in such projects as &quot;RadioAstron&quot; and Fobos-Grunt.

===Mathematics and Mathematical Modelling===
One of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century I. M. Gelfand was at the head of the Department of heat transmission before his departure for the United States in 1989. He was carrying out the fundamental works on functional analysis, algebra and topology. A. N. Tikhonov worked initially also in these areas of mathematics. However, Tikhonov is better known for his works of more applied orientation, such as methods for solving ill-posed problems (Tikhonov regularization). Tikhonov also created the theory of differential equations with a small parameter at the highest derivative. The general theory of stability of difference schemes was developed by . Samarskii considered mathematical modelling as an independent scientific discipline. S. P. Kurdyumov created a whole scientific school in nonlinear dynamics and synergetics in Russia.

Currently, the existing arsenal of numerical methods is updated and improved in response to the growing complexity of the models and the possibilities of modern supercomputers. Scientists of KIAM elaborate grid methods for solving computational problems, which has led, in particular, to the creation of a declarative language &quot;Norma&quot;.

===Computers and Programming===
The first studies were carried out still on mechanical calculators &quot;Mercedes&quot; by a large staff of estimators. Currently, work is underway to create a distributed computing system based on combining several supercomputers, which are used for grid – technology and developed a specialized operating system (DVM).

===Robotics===
Currently, work on robotics is carried out in:
* the Group of of the Sector under the guidance of (virtual football),
* the Group of (vision systems),
* the Group of (autonomous tracked vehicles).

===Computational biology===
Since 2016, the sphere of interest of KIAM includes also computational biology problems, which are solved in IMPB RAS – Branch of KIAM RAS in Pushchino.

===Specialized research projects===
* The project &quot;RadioAstron&quot;
* The project &quot;Norma&quot;
* The project &quot;DVM&quot;
* The project &quot;GNS&quot;
* The project &quot;grid&quot; (multiprocessor computations)
* The project &quot;Virtual football&quot; 
* International Scientific Optical Network (ISON)

===Teaching and social activities===
Most of the leading employees of KIAM worked part-time as professors of the Moscow State University and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. was the organizer and first Dean of the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics.

 was engaged in the mathematical education of secondary school pupils.

==History==

===Milestones===
The institute is located in Moscow, Russia. In 1978, it is named after Mstislav Keldysh. The institute was created in 1966 when it split from Steklov Institute of Mathematics. Already as the Department of Applied Mathematics of Steklov Institute it had conducted some outstanding research in the field of space exploration: in 1953 it developed the method of ballistic spacecraft descent, that was used on 12 April 1961 for Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s return to the Earth, and in 1957 Sputnik 1 orbit was calculated there using the computer processing of optical observation data.

As a result of the reorganization in RAS of 2015–2016 years Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology became a branch of KIAM.

<doc id="984476" wikidata="Q3122402" url="?curid=984476" title="Lobster roll">
<text>A lobster roll is a North American dish comprising lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog–style bun. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper, with variants made in some parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise. Other versions may contain diced celery or scallion. Potato chips or French fries are the typical side dishes.

==History==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink&quot; the lobster roll originated as a hot dish at a restaurant named Perry&#x27;s in Milford, Connecticut, as early as 1929. Its popularity then spread along he Connecticut coast. In Connecticut, the sandwich served warm is called a &quot;lobster roll&quot;; served cold, a &quot;lobster salad roll.&quot;

As far back as 1970, chopped lobster meat heated in drawn butter was served on a hot dog bun at roadside stands such as Red&#x27;s Eats in Maine. Lobster rolls in the U.S. are associated with the state of Maine, but are also commonly available at seafood restaurants in the other New England states and on Eastern Long Island, where lobster fishing is common.

Lobster rolls in Maine are characteristically served on a New England–style hot dog bun, which is split on the top instead of the side and has flat sides for grilling. The lobster meat is usually served cold, rather than warm or hot, and mayonnaise is typically spread inside the bun or tossed with the meat. The filling consists of chunked knuckle, claw, and lobster tail and is only lightly seasoned if at all. Four ounces is a standard serving size.

Lobster rolls are a popular seasonal meal, particularly among tourists throughout the Maritime provinces in Canada, especially Nova Scotia, where they may also appear on hamburger buns, baguettes, or other types of bread rolls and even in pita pockets. The traditional side orders are potato chips and dill pickles.

McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Canadian provinces, such as Nova Scotia and Ontario, as well as in New England, sometimes offer lobster rolls as a seasonal item in the summer.

<text>Plympton is a suburb of the city of Plymouth in Devon, England. It is in origin an ancient stannary town. It was an important trading centre for locally mined tin, and a seaport before the River Plym silted up and trade moved down river to Plymouth and was the seat of Plympton Priory the most significant local landholder for many centuries.

Plympton is an amalgamation of several villages, including St Mary&#x27;s, St Maurice, Colebrook, Woodford, Newnham, and Chaddlewood.

There is a handful of Primary schools, and 2 Secondary schools in Plympton. The majority of these are an academy converter

==Toponymy==
Although the name of the town appears to be derived from its location on the River Plym (compare, for instance, Otterton or Yealmpton), this is not considered to be the case. As J. Brooking Rowe pointed out in 1906, the town is not and never was sited on the river – rather it is sited on the ancient trackway called &#x27;the Ridgeway&#x27; from Dartmoor. The earliest surviving documentary reference to the place is as &quot;Plymentun&quot; in Anglo-Saxon charter S380 dated to around 900 AD, and this name may be derived from the Old English adjective &quot;plymen&quot;, meaning &quot;growing with plum-trees&quot;. So &quot;Plympton&quot; would have the meaning &quot;Plum-tree farm&quot;. Alternatively, Cornish derivations also give &quot;ploumenn&quot; meaning &#x27;plum&#x27; and &quot;plo(b)m&quot; meaning &#x27;lead&#x27; – possibly related to Latin &quot;plombum album&quot; ( &#x27;British lead&#x27;) or tin. The local civic association, however, suggests an unsupported alternative derivation from the Celtic &quot;Pen-lyn-dun&quot; (&quot;fort at the head of a creek&quot;).

By the early 13th century, the River Plym was named from a back-formation from this name and nearby Plymstock. This later led to the naming of the fishing port created at the river&#x27;s mouth (Plymouth, originally named Sutton) when the river estuary silted up too much for the monks to sail up river to Plympton any longer.

==History==
Nearby is the Iron Age hill fort of Boringdon Camp. Plympton is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being held by the king (William the Conqueror), with 27 villagers, 12 smallholders and 6 slaves.

In the early 12th century Plympton was the site of an important priory founded by William Warelwast. The members were Augustinian canons and the priory soon became the second richest monastic house in Devon (after Tavistock). The gatehouse of the priory is still in existence. In 1872 it was recorded that the gatehouse, kitchen and refectory were still in good condition.
Richard de Redvers (died 1107) was granted the feudal barony of Plympton, based at Plympton Castle, by King Henry I (1100–1135), of whom he was a most trusted supporter. The de Redvers family later became Earls of Devon. Their lands, including Plympton, and titles were later inherited by the Courtenay family, feudal barons of Okehampton. The ancient Stannary town remains dominated by its now ruined Norman motte-and-bailey castle and it still retains a cohesive medieval street pattern. A number of historic buildings in the local vernacular style of green Devon slate, limestone and lime-washed walls, with Dartmoor granite detailing, attest to all periods of its history.

Before the Reform Act 1832 the town was one of the rotten boroughs, and sent two MPs to the unreformed House of Commons.
The town was the birthplace and early residence of the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792) who became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts. He was mayor of Plympton in 1773. His father was headmaster of Plympton Grammar School which is a historic building in the centre of the town. Former pupils were Benjamin Haydon and Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, PRA, who were respectively first director of the National Gallery and first president of the Royal Photographic Society. Many of Reynold&#x27;s paintings were purchased by his friends the Parker family of local Saltram House, now owned by the National Trust, and are still on public display there.

==Architecture==

Plympton has 68 listed buildings in the database of Historic England. Of these, one is Grade I (Plympton House, St Peter&#x27;s Convent), six are Grade II* and 61 are Grade II.

Fore Street, the town&#x27;s main street, is lined with mediaeval buildings, around thirty of which are either Grade II* or Grade II listed. The Grade II* buildings are The Old Rectory, the Guildhall and Tudor Lodge.

===Historic estates===
The manor of Boringdon in Colebrook was a seat of the Parker family formerly of North Molton, which later acquired Saltram.

Loughtor (after c.1718 renamed Newnham Park) was the seat of the Selman family, of whom several were MPs. William Selman II was five times MP for Plympton Erle between 1420 and 1429. The estate was later a minor seat of a cadet branch of the Courtenay family.

Newnham was a manor that was the seat of the Strode family, whose monuments exist in St Mary&#x27;s Church.

==Churches==
Plympton has two churches. The Church of St Thomas at Plympton St Maurice (also known as the Church of St Maurice) is of Norman origin.

St Mary&#x27;s church was dedicated in 1311 and was originally a parish chapel attached to Plympton Priory. It has two aisles on each side of the nave, the outer aisles being shorter than the inner ones. The tower, built of granite ashlar, is visible from afar. The south porch is ornamented with carving and has a lierne vault. The outer north aisle is the earliest part of the church and the rest is mainly of the 15th century, the south aisle being the latest part. There are monuments to the Strode family, including a tomb-chest for Richard Strode (died 1464), the effigy being clad in armour. The monument of William Strode (died 1637) and his family shows husband, two wives and ten children. There is also a monument of W. Seymour (died 1801) in Coade stone and of Viscount Boringdon, the 11-year-old heir to the Earl of Morley of Saltram House who died in Paris in 1817, by François-Nicolas Delaistre.

==Modern Plympton==
Between about 1990 and 2010 Plympton has seen considerable growth as the suburban population of Plymouth has doubled. To help manage this rapid growth more efficiently, Plympton has been separated into a series of separate districts: Yealmpstone, Plympton-St Maurice, Colebrook, Underwood, Woodford and Chaddlewood.

===Community Council===
Plympton has a Community Council that was established when the town joined the Plymouth Local Authority area in 1967. The council is based at Harewood House and is a voluntary organisation serving as a forum for coordination and cooperation between social, recreational, voluntary, and community organisations in Plympton.

The Community Council decided that a notable Plympton resident should represent the town, for example by opening fetes and attending civic events as the representative of Plympton. In 1980 the first modern Stannator was elected to take up this role. In more recent times, a Youth Ambassador has also been elected to represent the young people of Plympton and attend events alongside the Stannator. 
The Stannator and Youth Ambassador are elected for a period of one year and invested at a ceremony at Harwood House on the third Saturday evening of April each year.

There have been 43 modern Stannators of Plympton.
There have been six Youth Ambassadors of Plympton.
===Public transport===
Plympton has four main bus services: routes 20A, 21, 21A and 59 which are operated by Plymouth Citybus and service 52 which is operated by Stagecoach Southwest.

In the past, railway facilities were originally provided at Plympton – for goods traffic only – by the horse-drawn Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway, but their branch was closed and sold to the South Devon Railway to allow them to build a line from Exeter to Plymouth. A station was opened in the town on 15 June 1848. From 1 June 1904 it was the eastern terminus for enhanced Plymouth area suburban services but it was closed to passenger traffic from 3 March 1959 and all goods related traffic from June 1964.

In addition to this railway connected to the National rail network there is also The Plym Valley Railway which is a preserved railway based at the reconstructed Marsh Mills station on Coypool Road. This was formerly part of the GWR Plymouth to Launceston branch line. The volunteer-run PVR is actively rebuilding the line between Marsh Mills and Plymbridge. Steam and diesel heritage trains run on numerous Sundays throughout the year.

Plymouth City Council has stated it would like to see a rail station reopened on the London main line running through the middle of Plympton, which would provide quick and frequent trains into Plymouth. But there are major obstacles to providing such a service on a primarily inter-regional rail route, shown when Ivybridge – on the same line – got a new station in 1994. Plymouth city council support the reopening of the station to deal with bad traffic congestion in Eastern Plymouth. After a feasibility study in 2017, A Plymouth Joint plan was opened for consultation in 2018 which included a suggested &#x27;Plymouth Metro&#x27; with a station at Plympton however, as of May 2020, nothing has been enacted.

===Schools===
Plympton has two state secondary schools serving pupils from ages 11–18. Both Plympton Academy and Hele&#x27;s School attract students from the Plympton area and surrounding areas of Laira, Ivybridge and Dartmoor.

===Sports===
Amateur club Plympton Athletic F.C. are members of the Devon Football League South and West Division as of 2020. Their home is the Lee Moor Stadium.

Plympton Victoria Rugby Club are the local rugby team.

Plympton Hash House Harriers, a well attended running club that runs (in a Hashing way) around Plymouth but retains its core identity to the village, often runs here.

=== Events ===
Plympton has hosted an annual fete called &#x27;The Lamb Feast&#x27; for many years on the local Castle Green. A key part of Plympton&#x27;s Midsummer Festival in mid June, the Lamb Feast and surrounding activities span over the weekend, organised by the Plympton Civic Association.

<text>Roni Size &amp; Reprazent (stylised as Roni Size / Reprazent) are a British drum and bass group fronted by Roni Size. Their debut album &quot;New Forms&quot; won the Mercury Music Prize in 1997. Their follow-up album &quot;In the Mode&quot; featured artists including Rahzel, Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine and Method Man.

==History==
In April 1997, Roni Size &amp; Reprazent had their live debut at Tribal Gathering. Roni Size created the group to perform live tracks he had been working on in the studio. The group included Full Cycle record label members Roni Size, Krust, Die, DJ Suv, operating &#x27;banks of equipment&#x27;; as well as Dynamite MC (vocals), Onallee (vocals), Si John (bass) and Clive Deamer (drums) taking centre stage.

The group&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;New Forms&quot;, was released on 23 June 1997, with singles featuring the vocals of Onallee including &quot;Brown Paper Bag&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Share the Fall&quot; and &quot;Watching Windows&quot;. The album went five times platinum, won the Mercury Prize, and Roni Size returned to the studio to concentrate on his output for V and Full Cycle and Dope Dragon.

On 9 October 2000, Roni Size &amp; Reprazent released their follow-up second studio album, &quot;In the Mode&quot;, released with singles &quot;Who Told You&quot;, &quot;Dirty Beats&quot; and &quot;Lucky Pressure&quot;.

=== &quot;New Forms&quot; (deluxe), 2008–2013 ===
Roni Size resurrected Reprazent in 2008 with the release of a deluxe edition of &quot;New Forms&quot; on Universal, but in September 2008 announced his intention to disband the act following a third album.

The band started 2009 with a tour of Australia as part of the Good Vibrations Festival. Following on from this, Roni Size and Reprazent returned to North America for the first time in seven years as one of the headliners at the 2009 Ultra Music Festival in Miami. They then went on to perform at Coachella, appearing as the final act of the festival.

In September 2009, Roni Size &amp; Reprazent played a gig with an orchestra and choir to mark the re-opening of Bristol’s Colston Hall, collaborating with the BBC’s Nature&#x27;s Great Events composer, William Goodchild. In addition to older material, the band played material from a forthcoming Roni Size &amp; Reprazent album.

=== Live shows, 2014–present ===
The band reformed circa 2014, with original members Roni Size, Dynamite MC, Onallee and Si John (bass). Additional artists included Yuval Gabay (Soul Coughing), D Product, Jay Wilcox and Pete Josef. Roni Size &amp; Reprazent toured several large festivals in Europe including Bestival, Glastonbury, Lovebox, Exit and Rock Herk. They were amongst the nominations for best dance act from the UK Festival Awards.

Also in 2015, a recording of the 2009 collaboration with William Goodchild &amp; The Emerald Ensemble was released.

In 2017, a new reissue of &quot;New Forms&quot; was released including more material (the CD version consisted of four discs).

== Musical style ==
The group&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;meticulously crafted break-beats that, when slowed down, revealed themselves as hip-hop beats&quot;. The most popular track, “Brown Paper Bag”, was praised in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a “masterpiece: an essay in hyper-kinetic pace, it piles up teetering stacks of instrumental layers, their cumulative weight triggering each step in a constant cycle of demolition and reconstruction of its latticework of melody, rhythm and mood&quot;.

Much of the acclaim centred on Size&#x27;s melding of the propulsive jungle beats accompanied by live drums and double bass. The band consists of Williams (compositions/programming), DJ Krust, Onallee (vocals), Dynamite MC and rapper Bahamadia (a former protégée of Gang Starr). Reprazent&#x27;s drum and bass is equally blended from hip hop, funk, soul and house.

<text>Steklov Institute of Mathematics or Steklov Mathematical Institute () is a premier research institute based in Moscow, specialized in mathematics, and a part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The institute is named after Vladimir Andreevich Steklov, who in 1919 founded the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in Leningrad. In 1934, this institute was split into separate parts for physics and mathematics, and the mathematical part became the Steklov Institute. At the same time, it was moved to Moscow. The first director of the Steklov Institute was Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov. From 19611964, the institute&#x27;s director was the notable mathematician Sergei Chernikov.

The old building of the Institute in Leningrad became its Department in Leningrad. Today, that department has become a separate institute, called the &quot;St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences&quot; or PDMI RAS, located in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The name &quot;St. Petersburg Department&quot; is misleading, however, because the St. Petersburg Department is now an independent institute. In 1966, the Moscow-based Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) split off from the Steklov Institute.

<doc id="984504" wikidata="Q2883414" url="?curid=984504" title="Banque Nationale de Paris">
<text>Banque Nationale de Paris () was a major French bank. It was formed in 1966 through the merger of Comptoir national d&#x27;escompte de Paris (CNEP, est. 1848) and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l&#x27;industrie (est. 1932). In 1999, it merged with Paribas to form BNP Paribas.

==Overview==

In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d&#x27;escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l&#x27;industrie to create BNP.

In 1990, BNP entered into an alliance with Dresdner Bank and supported a joint venture with Dresdner Bank to enter the Russia market supporting a Dresdner Bank branch in Saint Petersburg with Vladimir Putin&#x27;s close friend Mathias Warnig as its chairman. This alliance to enter the Eastern European markets continued until December 2000.

The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government&#x27;s privatization policy.

<doc id="984508" wikidata="Q17049737" url="?curid=984508" title="Internet censorship in Australia">
<text>Internet censorship in Australia is enforced by both the country&#x27;s criminal law as well as voluntarily enacted by internet service providers. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has the power to enforce content restrictions on Internet content hosted within Australia, and maintain a blocklist of overseas websites which is then provided for use in filtering software. The restrictions focus primarily on child pornography, sexual violence, and other illegal activities, compiled as a result of a consumer complaints process.

In October 2008, a policy extending Internet censorship to a system of mandatory filtering of overseas websites which are, or potentially would be, &quot;refused classification&quot; (RC) in Australia was proposed. Australia is classified as &quot;under surveillance&quot; (a type of &quot;Internet enemy&quot;) by Reporters Without Borders due to the proposed legislation. If enacted, the legislation would have required Internet service providers to censor access to such content for all users. However, the policy was rejected by the Coalition and was later withdrawn by the Labor party. The same day the withdrawal was announced, the then Communications Minister stated that as a result of notices to Australian ISPs, over 90% of Australians using Internet Services were going to have a web filter. Australian Federal Police would then pursue smaller ISPs and work with them to meet their &quot;obligation under Australian law&quot;. iiNet and Internode quietly confirmed that the request to censor content from Australian Federal Police went from voluntary to mandatory under s313 in an existing law. iiNet had sought legal advice and accepted the s313 mandatory notice but would not reveal the legal advice publicly.

In June 2015, the country passed an amendment which will allow the court-ordered censorship of websites deemed to primarily facilitate copyright infringement. In December 2016, the Federal Court of Australia ordered more than fifty ISPs to censor 5 sites that infringe on the Copyright Act after rights holders, Roadshow Films, Foxtel, Disney, Paramount, Columbia and the 20th Century Fox companies filed a lawsuit. The sites barred include The Pirate Bay, Torrentz, TorrentHound, IsoHunt and SolarMovie.

In April 2019, the Senate passed a bill in response to the Christchurch mosque shooting which required websites that provide a hosting service to &quot;ensure the expeditious removal&quot; of audio or visual material documenting &quot;abhorrent violent conduct&quot; (including terrorist acts, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape or kidnapping), produced by a perpetrator or accomplice, within a reasonable time frame. Hosts must also report such content to authorities. Those who do not remove the materials may face fines and jail time. 
Several ISPs had already voluntarily blocked websites related to footage of the Christchurch shooting before the bill had passed.

==Current status==
A collection of both federal and state laws apply to Internet content in Australia.

===Federal law===
While the Australian constitution does not explicitly provide for freedom of speech or press, the High Court has held that a right to freedom of expression is implied in the constitution, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government routinely monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can and do engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.

====Broadcasting Services Act 1992====
Provisions of Schedule 5 and Schedule 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 inserted in 1999 and 2007 allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority to effectively ban some content from being hosted within Australia. Under this regime, if a complaint is issued about material &quot;broadcast&quot; on the Internet the ACMA is allowed to examine the material under the guidelines for film and video.

The content is deemed to be &quot;prohibited&quot; where it is (or in ACMA&#x27;s judgement likely would be):
* Refused classification, or classified X18+
* Classified R18+, and not protected by an adult verification system
* Classified MA15+ and not protected by an adult verification system, where the user has paid to access the content.
* Cyberbullying

Where content is deemed to be prohibited, the ACMA is empowered to issue local sites with a takedown notice under which the content must be removed; failure to do so can result in fines of up to $11,000 per day. If the site is hosted outside Australia, the content in question is added to a blocklist of banned URLs. This list of banned Web pages is then added to filtering software (encrypted), which must be offered to all consumers by their Internet service providers. In March 2009, this blocklist was leaked online.

A number of take down notices have been issued to some Australian-hosted websites. According to Electronic Frontiers Australia in at least one documented case, the hosting was merely shifted to a server in the United States, and the DNS records updated so that consumers may never have noticed the change.

====Suicide Related Materials Offences Act 2006====
In 2006, the Federal Parliament passed the &quot;Suicide Related Materials Offences Act&quot;, which makes it illegal to use communications media such as the Internet to discuss the practical aspects of suicide.

====Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015====
In June 2015, an amendment was passed to copyright law of Australia, which allows for the court-ordered censorship of non-domestic websites whose primary purpose is to facilitate copyright infringement.

==== Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019 ====
In April 2019, the Senate passed this bill in response to the Christchurch mosque shooting, which was live-streamed and circulated online. It requires websites that provide a hosting service to &quot;ensure the expeditious removal&quot; of audio or visual material documenting &quot;abhorrent violent conduct&quot; (including terrorist acts, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape or kidnapping), produced by a perpetrator or accomplice, within a reasonable time-frame. Hosts must also identify and report such content to authorities. Those who do not remove the materials may face fines (including up to $10.5 million or 10% of annual revenue for corporations) and jail time. This law applies regardless of whether or not the content is hosted on servers in Australia. The bill has faced criticism for being imprecise, with no formal definition of how quickly sites must remove the abhorrent content, and being wider-reaching than needed (it applies to any service that hosts content, while the intent of the bill implied a goal to impose it on social networking services).

===State and territory laws===
Some state governments have laws that ban the transmission of material unsuitable for minors.

In New South Wales, Internet censorship legislation was introduced in 2001 which criminalises online material which is unsuitable for minors. In 2002, the New South Wales Standing Committee on Social Issues issued a report recommending that the legislation be repealed, and in response the New South Wales government stated that the legislation &quot;will be neither commenced nor repealed&quot; until after the review of the Commonwealth Internet censorship legislation had been completed.

===Notable examples===
In October 2000, Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) attempted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) to obtain documents relating to the implementation of the web filter. While a few were released, many were not, and in 2003 new legislation, &quot;Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002&quot;, was passed by the Liberal government and four independents, and opposed by The Greens and the Australian Labor Party. While the stated reason for the bill was to prevent people accessing child pornography by examining the censored sites, this bill exempted whole documents from FOI, many of which did not reference prohibited content at all. EFA state that the bill was designed to prevent further public scrutiny of web filtering proposals.

In 2002, New South Wales Police Force Minister Michael Costa attempted, without success, to shut down three protest websites by appealing to the then-communications minister Richard Alston. The &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; stated these were Melbourne Indymedia and S11 websites, and that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (the predecessor to ACMA) cleared them of breaching government regulations on 30 October 2002.

Also in 2002, and under the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Federal Court ordered Fredrick Töben to remove material from his Australian website which denied aspects of the Holocaust and vilified Jews.

In 2006, Richard Neville published a &quot;spoof&quot; website that had a fictional transcript of John Howard apologising to Australians for the Iraq War. The website was forcibly taken offline by the government with no recourse.

After the devastating bushfires in February 2009, details about an alleged arsonist were posted online by bloggers. Victoria Police deputy commissioner Kieran Walshe had asked the state Director of Public Prosecutions to examine the possibility of removing these blogs from the web, as they might jeopardise any court case.

In March 2009, after a user posted a link to a site on ACMA&#x27;s blocklist on the Whirlpool forum, Whirlpool&#x27;s service provider, &quot;Bulletproof Networks&quot;, was threatened with fines of $11,000 per day if the offending link was not removed. The same link in an article on EFA&#x27;s website was removed in May 2009 after ACMA issued a &quot;link-deletion notice&quot;, and the EFA took the precautionary step of also removing indirect links to the material in question.

The 2009 winner of the George Polk award for videography shows footage of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan being shot and dying during Iran protests. This footage has also been declared &quot;prohibited content&quot; by ACMA, attracting fines of $11,000 per day for any Australian website which posts a link to the video.

On 15 December 2009, the Labor government announced plans to mandate censorship of refused classification material in Australia. The then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, released a statement titled &quot;Measures to improve safety of the internet for families&quot;, which briefly outlined the proposed purpose and methods of filtering. The scheme aimed to develop &quot;a package that balances safety for families and the benefits of the digital revolution&quot;, and was intended to complement the work of the ACMA by blocking content hosted overseas which is out of the control of Australian authorities.

An anti-censorship website was hosted on stephenconroy.com.au and stephen-conroy.com, satirising Senator Conroy and his proposed blocklist. The site referred to Conroy as the &quot;minister for fascism&quot;, and contained humorous graphics and statements condemning censorship. On 18 December 2009, the domain stephenconroy.com.au was seized by auDA, somewhat ironically for an anti-censorship site, and content was then moved to stephen-conroy.com. The basis for seizure regarded the moral owner of the domain, not its content.

On 22 May 2009, it was disclosed in the press, citing WikiLeaks, that the Australian Government had added Dr Philip Nitschke&#x27;s online &quot;Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot;, which deals with the topic of voluntary euthanasia, to the blocklist maintained by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority used to filter web access to citizens of Australia. Euthanasia groups will hold seminars around Australia teaching how to evade the proposed filter using proxy servers and virtual networks. A spokeswoman for Senator Conroy said that euthanasia would not be targeted by the proposed web filter, however Stephen Conroy has previously stated that &quot;while euthanasia remains illegal it will be captured by the RC filter&quot;.

In January 2010, the Encyclopedia Dramatica article &quot;Aboriginal&quot; was removed from the search engine results of Google Australia, following a complaint that its content was racist. George Newhouse, the lawyer for the complainant, claims the site is &quot;illegal&quot; and should be blocked by the mandatory web filter. As the address of the site appeared on the leaked ACMA blocklist, it is likely that the whole site would be censored by the filter. A search on terms related to the article will produce a message that one of the results has been removed after a legal request relating to Australia&#x27;s Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

In 2010, the website of the Australian Sex Party is banned from within several state and federal government departments, including Stephen Conroy&#x27;s Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority. Convenor of the Australian Sex Party Fiona Patten has described this ban as &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.

In April 2013, it was revealed that an IP address used by more than 1,200 websites had been censored by certain Internet service providers. It was discovered by the Melbourne Free University which was one of the sites censored. It was later revealed that the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) had ordered the censorship of the address to target a fraud website, and that the remaining websites were censored unintentionally. The block was subsequently lifted. ASIC subsequently revealed that it had used its censorship powers 10 times over the preceding 12 months, and that a separate action taken in March had also caused the inadvertent temporary censorship of around 1000 untargeted active sites, as well as around 249,000 sites that hosted &quot;no substantive content&quot; or advertised their domain name for sale. The censorship was carried out under the section 313 legislation, and censorship notices were sent to four or five ISPs on each occasion.

In March 2019, several websites disseminating footage of the Christchurch mosque shooting were censored by major ISPs in Australia and New Zealand, including 4chan, 8chan, and LiveLeak .

On 2 September 2020, a woman was arrested in Ballarat for making a Facebook post that promoted a protest over COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria. A viral video from before her incitement charge shows her offering to take the post down and trying to convince the police that she did not know it was illegal. Rosalind Croucher of the Australian Human Rights Commission and Wendy Harris of the Victorian Bar both expressed concerns that police had infringed on freedom of expression with a disproportionate response. Politicians Michael O&#x27;Brien and Steven Ciobo, while reaffirming their support for the lockdown, also criticised the arrest as heavy handed.

==Voluntary censorship by ISPs==

=== 2011 child abuse filtering ===

In June 2011, two Australian ISPs, Telstra and Optus, confirmed they would voluntarily block access to a list of child-abuse websites provided by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority and more websites on a list compiled by unnamed international organisations from mid-year.

=== Christchurch mosque shootings ===

On 20 March 2019, Telstra, Optus, TPG and Vodafone censored access to several websites in response to the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. The websites, which included LiveLeak, 4chan, 8chan, Voat, Kiwi Farms and Zero Hedge, were blocked for allegedly hosting footage of the shootings that was originally live-streamed on Facebook.

Sites were banned using a combination of DNS blocking and IP blocking. DNS blocking is relatively easy to circumvent (whether implemented through ISP-controlled DNS servers or sniffing all DNS requests); whereas IP bans can only be circumvented with a proxy, VPN or Tor. Information on the exact methods and timeframes that sites were blocked is vague and anecdotal, but there was a significant amount of online discussion at the time. Optus appeared to use IP blocks for 4chan and possibly other sites. Telstra took a similar approach. Most bans appeared to be lifted after several weeks, with 4chan and Voat bans extending longer. One source states that the Telstra bans lasted only &quot;a few hours&quot;, but this does not agree with most online discussion.

The telecom providers claimed to be acting independently and not under directive of government or law enforcement, which sparked some public controversy. Normally such censorship would be ordered by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority, but this event exposed the independent power that ISPs may exercise.

Telstra released a brief statement soon after blocking the sites, referring to &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; that required an &quot;extraordinary response&quot;. TPG did not officially respond to media inquires other than a statement that it would &quot;comply with any request of this nature made to us by authorities&quot;; however, user reports indicate that TPG also temporarily blocked access to a subset of these sites.

==Proposed mandatory filtering legislation==
In October 2008, the governing Australian Labor Party proposed extending Internet censorship to a system of mandatory filtering of overseas websites which are, or potentially would be, &quot;refused classification&quot; (RC) in Australia. As of June 2010, legislation to enact the proposed policy had not been drafted. The proposal has generated substantial opposition, with a number of concerns being raised by opponents and only a few groups strongly supporting the policy.

In November 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) released a document indicating that the earliest date any new legislation could reach parliament was mid-2013. However, voluntary filtering by ISPs remains a possibility.

===Terminology===
Proposed Australian laws on Internet censorship are sometimes referred to as the Great Firewall of Australia, Rabbit Proof Firewall (a reference to the Australian Rabbit-proof fence), Firewall Australia or Great Firewall Reef (a reference to Great Barrier Reef and the Great Firewall of China).

The proposed filter has been referred to in the media variously as an Internet filter and a web filter. The worldwide-web is a myriad of software documents containing pointers to each other, hosted on server computers around the world. The Internet is the physical network used to convey requests from users&#x27; computers to these servers and responses from the servers back to the users.

The proposed filter only monitors certain ports specific to conveying web traffic. As it aims to monitor the majority of web traffic, it is appropriately referred to as a web filter. As it is agnostic of the majority (99.99%) of other connections a user&#x27;s computer might establish with other computers on the Internet, it is something of a misnomer to refer to it as an Internet filter.

Since the proposed filter is situated at the Internet service provider (the junction between users and the Internet at large), introducing such a filter cannot possibly slow down the Internet itself. It can only (potentially) slow down access to the Internet by users of that ISP. Ignoring load considerations, communication speed across the Internet for any non-web traffic would be unaffected.

===History===
In 1995, the Labor Party of Federal Government began inquiries into regulating access to online content as part of expanding the scope of classification material mediums.

In the same year, the Liberal Party of Victoria and Western Australia State Governments and Country Liberal Party of Northern Territory Government implemented changes to law that allows censoring online content as part of expanding the scope of classification material. Queensland introduced similar legislation at the time, but a case of an ISP systems administrator showed it did not apply to online services when the judge ruled that the act did not apply.

In 1996, the Labor Party of New South Wales State Government attempted to propose a standard Internet censorship legislation for all Australian States and Territories. The legislation would have made ISPs responsible for their customers&#x27; communications. But the proposed legislation attracted widespread protests and has since been postponed in favour of a national scheme.

In 1997, following the previous Federal Government, the Liberal Party further commissioned inquiries into a variety of online censorship schemes, including self-imposed censorship by ISPs.

By 1999, the then Federal Government attempted to introduce an Internet censorship regime. Some have pointed out it was to gain support from minority senators to assist with the sale of Telstra and introduction of GST, but as noted above, this censorship plan had been in development for several years.

In 2001, CSIRO was commissioned to examine Internet content filtering. The report focused primarily on evaluating the effectiveness of client-side filtering schemes (which were generally ineffective), but also discussed some of the difficulties with ISP-based filtering

In March 2003, the Fairfax papers &quot;The Age&quot; and the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported the results of a survey taken by The Australia Institute of 200 children, which found that many of them had found pornography on the Internet. Over the next few days was a storm of media and political attention, and there were calls for finer Internet filters and tougher censorship laws. Analysis of the report showed little new material, and only 2% of girls had admitted being exposed to pornography, while the figure for boys was 38%; such a difference between boys and girls would seem to indicate that inadvertent exposure was rare, contrary to the conclusions of the report. After the controversy died down, no new action resulted from the new report, media attention, or political speeches.

In 2003, the Labor Party opposed filtering at the ISP level, with Labor Senator Kate Lundy stating &quot;Unfortunately, such a short memory regarding the debate in 1999 about Internet content has led the coalition to already offer support for greater censorship by actively considering proposals for unworkable, quick fixes that involve filtering the Internet at the ISP level.&quot; 

Shortly before the 2004 federal election, two political parties issued new policies on Internet censorship. The Australian Labor Party&#x27;s policy involved voluntary adherence by users. The Family First Party released a far stricter policy of mandatory filtering at the Internet service provider level.

The Australian Family Association petitioned the Australian Federal Government in 2004 to further restrict access by children to pornographic material via the Internet. The petition was submitted in December 2004.

On 21 March 2006, the Labor Party committed to requiring all ISPs to implement a mandatory Internet blocking system applicable to &quot;all households, and to schools and other public Internet points&quot; to &quot;prevent users from accessing any content that has been identified as prohibited by the Australian Communications and Media Authority&quot;.

On the same day, the then communications minister Helen Coonan stated that to &quot;filter the Internet will only result in slowing down the Internet for every Australian without effectively protecting children from inappropriate and offensive content&quot;. 

===Political party policies, positions and statements===

====Labor Party====
On 31 December 2007, Stephen Conroy announced the Federal Government&#x27;s intention to introduce an ISP-based filter to censor &quot;inappropriate material&quot; from the Internet to protect children. In this announcement, it was stated that adults could opt out of the filter to receive uncensored access to the Internet.

In May 2008, the government commenced an $82 million &quot;cybersafety plan&quot; which included an additional mandatory filter with no opt-out provision. This ISP-based filter aims to stop adults from downloading content that is illegal to possess in Australia, such as child pornography or materials related to terrorism.

In March 2009, Stephen Conroy dismissed suggestions that the Government would use the filter to crack down on political dissent as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. He stated that the filter would only be used to remove &quot;refused classification&quot; (RC) content, using the same rationale as existing television, radio and print publications, and that the Senate could be relied upon to provide rigorous assessment of any proposed legislation. However, Labor&#x27;s policy statement on the issue contradicts this. It is also contrary to an earlier ministerial release in 2008.

The most recent explanation of the government&#x27;s position on this issue is provided on the ministry website. This clearly states that only ISP-level filtering of (designated) &quot;refused classification&quot; (RC) material will be &quot;mandatory&quot; under their policy. However, ISP&#x27;s will be &quot;encouraged&quot; to offer ISP-level filtering of &#x27;adult content&#x27; as an &quot;optional&quot; (commercial) service to their customers. Such an optional extra service is aimed at parents trying to protect their children from &#x27;undesirable&#x27; content that would otherwise be available, because it would not be RC (e.g., it might receive a classification of &quot;R&quot;).

Labor Senator Kate Lundy said in January 2010 that she is lobbying within the party for an &quot;opt-out&quot; filter, describing it as the &quot;least worst&quot; option. In February 2010 she said she would propose the opt-out option when the filtering legislation goes before caucus.

Stephen Conroy has stated that 85% of Internet Service Providers, including Telstra, Optus, iPrimus, and iiNet, welcome the Internet filter. In response, Steve Dalby, iiNet&#x27;s chief regulatory officer, stated that iiNet as a company does not support the Internet filter, and never has.

On 9 July 2010, Stephen Conroy announced that any mandatory filtering would be delayed until at least 2011.

On 9 November 2012, Stephen Conroy shelved the proposed mandatory filter legislation in favour of existing legislation, touting that it was successful in compelling the largest ISPs to adopt a filter. As a result, 90% of Australian Internet users are censored from accessing some web-based content.

====The Liberal/Nationals Coalition====
In February 2009, then opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin obtained independent legal advice confirming that a mandatory censorship regime would require new legislation. In March 2009, after the ACMA blocklist was leaked and iiNet withdrew from the filtering trials, he stated that Stephen Conroy was &quot;completely botching the implementation of this filtering policy&quot;.

In March 2010, shadow treasurer Joe Hockey attacked the filter, saying &quot;What we have in the government&#x27;s Internet filtering proposals is a scheme that is likely to be unworkable in practice. But more perniciously it is a scheme that will create the infrastructure for government censorship on a broader scale&quot;. During the 2010 Federal Election, Liberal communications spokesman Tony Smith announced that &quot;a Coalition government will not introduce a mandatory ISP level filter&quot;, with Joe Hockey also announcing an intention to vote against the policy if Labor is re-elected. This followed the 2010 Federal Conference of the National Party passing a motion proposed by the Young Nationals to &quot;oppose any mandatory ISP-level internet censorship&quot;.

In November 2012, Coalition Communications spokesman welcomed the proposed legislation being dropped as it endangered freedom and Internet performance. However, some Coalition members voiced concern, citing support for a mandatory filter to protect children and families but will not propose it citing lack of political support at the time. The Coalition have proposed an &quot;eSafety commissioner&quot; to take down undesirable content from the Internet as a means to protect children. It was met with criticism as a duplication of current government efforts and &quot;difficult and expensive&quot; to implement.

In September 2013, two days before the federal election, the Coalition announced they would introduce an opt-out filter for all Internet connections, including both fixed line and mobile devices. This has since been retracted as &quot;poorly worded&quot; in a statement from Malcolm Turnbull, who said, &quot;The correct position is that the Coalition will encourage mobile phone and Internet service providers to make available software which parents can choose to install on their own devices to protect their children from inappropriate material.&quot;

====The Greens====
The Greens do not support the filter, and Greens senator Scott Ludlam predicts that due to obstruction in the Senate, the legislation will not be introduced until after the next federal election.

At the end of 2008, he asked questions in parliament related to the filtering trial, for which the Government provided answers in January 2009:
* When asked about the stated public demand for Internet filtering, the government responded that the filtering was an election commitment
* The web filter would be easy to bypass using technological measures
* 674 out of 1,370 censored sites on the mandatory list relate to child pornography; 506 sites would be classified as R18+ or X18+, despite the fact that such content is legal to view in Australia. The remaining 190 sites from this number on the blocklist can be viewed at the full revealed blocklists on WikiLeaks.

Ludlam believes that the Labor party may have hit a wall of &quot;technical impossibility&quot;, and the filter does not suit its purpose:

&quot;This isn&#x27;t a great advertisement for the workability of any large scale scheme. The proposal has always been unpopular, now perhaps the Government is starting to come to grips with what the industry has been saying all along: if your policy objective is to protect children on-line, this is not the way to go about it.&quot;

Despite their lack of support for the filter, The Greens preselected Clive Hamilton, whose think-tank The Australia Institute first suggested an ISP-based Internet filter, for the by-election in the seat of Higgins.

====Independents and minor parties====
In October 2008, Family First senator Senator Steve Fielding was reported to support the censorship of hardcore pornography and fetish material under the government&#x27;s plans to filter access to the web. A Family First spokeswoman confirmed that the party wants X-rated content banned for everyone, including adults.

A spokesman for independent senator Nick Xenophon said: &quot;should the filtering plan go ahead, he would look to use it to block Australians from accessing overseas online casino sites, which are illegal to run in Australia&quot;. Senator Xenophon has, however, stated that he has serious concerns about the plan, and in February 2009 withdrew all support, stating that &quot;the more evidence that&#x27;s come out, the more questions there are on this&quot;. He believes that money would be better spent educating parents and cracking peer-to-peer groups used by paedophiles.

A political party associated with the Eros Association, the Australian Sex Party, was launched in November 2008 and plans to campaign on issues including censorship and the federal government&#x27;s promised web filter. In 2014, the party won a seat in the Victorian Legislative Council.

===Two blocklists===
As of October 2008, the plan includes two blocklists, the first used to filter &quot;illegal&quot; content, and the second used to filter additional content unsuitable for children. The first filter will be mandatory for all users of the Internet, while the second filter allows opting out. The government will not release details of the content on either list, but has stated that the mandatory filter would include at least 10,000 sites, and include both the ACMA blocklist and UK&#x27;s Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) blocklist. In December 2008 the IWF list caused problems when the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was added to the list, as it prevented many people in the UK from being able to edit Wikipedia.

The ACMA definitions of &quot;prohibited content&quot; give some idea of what could potentially be blocklisted. Online content prohibited by ACMA includes:
* Any online content that is classified RC or X 18+ by the Classification Board. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, depictions of bestiality, material containing excessive violence or sexual violence, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use, and/or material that advocates the doing of a terrorist act.
* Content which is classified R 18+* and not subject to a restricted access system that prevents access by children. This includes depictions of simulated sexual activity, material containing strong, realistic violence and other material dealing with intense adult themes.

In answer to a question in Parliament in October 2008, the government in January 2009 stated that of the 1,370 websites on the blocklist, 674 were related to child pornography, and the remainder would be classified as R18+ and X18+.

Two websites are known to be on the ACMA blocklist after they were submitted to ACMA for review. When ACMA responded with the advice that these sites had been placed upon its denial list, ACMA&#x27;s response was in turn posted back to the web by the original submitters, with the purpose of demonstrating that political content would be censored by the mandatory filter. One was an anti-abortion website, with details posted to Whirlpool, and the other was a copy of Denmark&#x27;s own Internet blocklist, with both the blocklist and ACMA&#x27;s response posted on WikiLeaks. The web hosting company for Whirlpool, &quot;Bulletproof networks&quot;, was threatened with $11,000 in fines per day if the link was not removed, so Whirlpool removed the link to the restricted site. Civil liberties campaigners regard the inclusion of these sites on the blocklist as a demonstration that it is not difficult to get a site placed on the blocklist, and that the blocklist includes sites which are themselves not illegal to view.

===Leaking of the ACMA blocklist===
18 March 2009: WikiLeaks publishes a list which is &quot;derived from the ACMA list for the use of government-approved censorship software in its &quot;ACMA-only&quot; mode.&quot; Included in the list were &quot;the websites of a Queensland dentist, a tuckshop convener and a kennel operator&quot;. 

19 March 2009: Australian media sources report that the ACMA blocklist has been leaked to WikiLeaks &quot;The seemingly innocuous websites were among a leaked list of 2300 websites the Australian Communications and Media Authority was planning to ban to protect children from graphic pornography and violence.&quot; 
ACMA claimed that the list which appeared on the WikiLeaks website was not the ACMA &#x27;blocklist&#x27;, as it contained 2,300 URLs. ACMA claimed the ACMA list contained only 1,061 URLs in August 2008, and has at no stage contained 2,300.

The ACMA report on the issue noted the similarities between the two lists, yet addressed only the claim reported in the media that the list was the blocklist. The report only contains the following claims about the two lists:
* &quot;The list provided to ACMA differs markedly in length and format to the ACMA blocklist.&quot;
* &quot;The ACMA blocklist has at no stage been 2,300 URLs in length and at August 2008 consisted of 1,061 URLs.&quot;

20 March 2009: WikiLeaks published another list, this time closer to the length published by ACMA. WikiLeaks believes that the list is up-to-date as of the time of publication

25 March 2009: Stephen Conroy has reportedly stated that this list closely resembles the ACMA list.

26 March 2009: The above report of 25 March 2009 was followed by the Minister&#x27;s statement on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; television program the following day that &quot;the second list which has appeared appears to be closer [to the true deny-list]. I don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s on the list but I&#x27;m told by [...] ACMA it appears to be closer to the actual, legitimate list.&quot;
On the program Senator Conroy also explained that the seemingly inexplicable censoring of a dentist&#x27;s website was due to subversion of the website by the Russian mafia, who had inserted RC material.

In the same discussion Bill Henson&#x27;s website, despite the PG rating given to his photographs by the same body, appeared on the blocklist due to a technical error according to Stephen Conroy The ACMA has since released a statement claiming the technical error was a &quot;computer system caching error&quot; and further stated &quot;found that this is the only URL where a caching error resulting in the URL being incorrectly added to the list.&quot;

===Live filtering trials===
The government has committed to trials of the mandatory web filter before implementation.

On 28 July 2008, an Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority report entitled &quot;Closed Environment Testing of ISP-Level Internet Content Filtering&quot; showed performance and accuracy problems with the six unnamed ISP-based filters trialled. EFA analysis of the report showed that:
* One filter caused a 22% drop in speed even when it was &quot;not&quot; performing filtering;
* Only one of the six filters had an acceptable level of performance (a drop of 2% in a laboratory trial), the others causing drops in speed of between 21% and 86%;
* The most accurate filters were often the slowest;
* All filters tested had problems with under-censoring, allowing access to between 2% and 13% of material that they should have censored; and
* All filters tested had serious problems with over-censoring, wrongly censoring access to between 1.3% and 7.8% of the websites tested.
* The trial tested speed on a simple &quot;black listed or not&quot; basis for all simulated clients on all systems, yet the report outlines the ability of the filters to provide customised filtering to each client (as would be required by the two levels of filtering which ACMA is proposing) which would significantly impact test results.

In November 2008, the Government hired Melbourne company ENEX TestLab, an RMIT spin-off, to design a live pilot test on a real network. In this trial, in which several ISPs have expressed an interest, 10,000 blocklisted &quot;unwanted&quot; websites would be censored in addition to 1,300 websites identified by ACMA. As an incentive for participation, the department states that participating ISPs &quot;will be recognised for their participation in the Pilot. This recognition will strengthen their brand image with the community&quot;.

These ISPs will also be allowed to keep any software and hardware purchased by the government for the trial. The trial may include some ability to censor or alert on the presence of proxies. Both filtered and unfiltered users will be surveyed as part of the trial.

ISPs participating in the Live Trial will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with ACMA.

Communications from Senator Conroy&#x27;s office have indicated that the live trial will occur without the participation of any customers due to concerns about the impact on network performance of filtering 10,000 URLs. Telstra and Internode have stated that they will not take part in the trial. iiNet has stated that it will take part in the trial only to show that the filtering will not work. Optus has stated that it will only test a heavily cut-down filtering model containing only 1,300 URLs in a limited geographic area, and customers will be allowed to opt out.

At the end of 2008, Stephen Conroy anticipated that the live trial would test the filtering of BitTorrent traffic, but in March 2009 he stated that the proposed filters would not be effective on peer-to-peer traffic.

The trial was originally scheduled to be commenced in December 2008, but, after the existence of a report critical of the trial became known, the trial was pushed back. On 11 February 2009 a new filtering trial was announced, initially with the ISPs iPrimus Telecommunications, Tech 2U, Webshield, OMNIconnect, Netforce and Highway 1. Testing with each ISP will take place for at least six weeks once filtering equipment has been obtained and installed, and iPrimus expects the trial to begin in late April or early May with five or ten thousand participants. The trial will be opt-in, with ISPs asking for volunteers, although all WebShield customers already receive a filtered service. None of the top three ISPs, Telstra, Optus and iiNet, have been included in the trial, although both iiNet and Optus did expect to be involved at a later time. iiNet withdrew itself from consideration for the trial in March 2009, with Michael Malone giving as reasons the media storm around the leaked blocklist, the changing nature of policy, and &quot;confused&quot; explanations of the trial&#x27;s purpose.

In July 2009, some results from the trials began to emerge. Five of the nine participating ISPs reported minimal speed or technical problems associated with the trials. Some ISPs reported that thousands of their members had voluntarily participated in the trials; others, that less than 1% had participated, and that this was not a representative sample. Some customers complained about over-blocking, and withdrew from the trial. One example was the censorship of the pornography website RedTube: ACMA refused to confirm or deny if the site was on the list, or if the site was legal. Leading Australian statistic experts, however, have labelled the trials as unscientific, lacking in proper methodology, unrepresentative and &quot;about the worst way you can do it&quot;.

In December 2009, the results of the filtering trial were released. Stephen Conroy stated, &quot;The report into the pilot trial of ISP-level filtering demonstrates that censoring RC-rated material can be done with 100 percent accuracy and negligible impact on Internet speed&quot;. However, concerns have been raised about the report: only a small minority of ISP users participated; the trial did not test using any high-speed Internet connections similar to those available with the National Broadband Network; there is evidence that the filter was evaded; and with only 600 to 700 sites on the RC blocklists, the effect of the filter would be marginal at best.

===Opinion polling===
In February 2010, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hungry Beast&quot; program commissioned McNair Ingenuity Research to perform a telephone poll of 1,000 Australians. Key results were
* To the proposition &quot;We need Government regulation of content on the Internet the same as we have Government regulation of content for other media&quot; 62% agreed, 35% disagreed.
* &quot;Having a mandatory Government Internet filter that would automatically censor all access in Australia, to overseas websites containing material that is Refused Classification?&quot; Refused Classification was defined as &quot;Images and information about one or more of the following: child sexual abuse, bestiality, sexual violence, gratuitous, exploitative or offensive sexual fetishes, detailed instructions on or promotion of crime, violence or use of illegal drugs&quot;. 80% were in favour, 19% against.
* &quot;A Government appointed body determining whether a website is appropriate for you to visit?&quot; 50% in favour, 46% against.
* &quot;If a mandatory Internet Filter is established, are you in favour or not in favour of the community being advised which websites have been Refused Classification and the reason why they have been refused classification?&quot; 91% in favour, 8% against.
* &quot;Some opponents of the Government&#x27;s mandatory Internet Filter are concerned that if it were put in place, future Governments could use Internet Filtering technology to restrict free speech or censor other forms of website content they don&#x27;t approve of. Do you share this concern?&quot; 70% concerned, 27% unconcerned.

The wide variation to answers to essentially the same question can be attributed to variations in the wording of the questions asked. The results were initially reported as &quot;80pc back web filter: poll&quot; despite the fact that 46% were against &quot;a government body determining whether a website is appropriate to visit&quot;.

In February 2009, a national telephone poll of 1,100 people was conducted by Galaxy and commissioned by GetUp!. It found that only 5 per cent of respondents want ISPs to be responsible for protecting children online, and only 4% want Government to have this responsibility.

In March 2010, the results of the Whirlpool Australia broadband survey 2009 were published. This survey was of 21,755 experienced Internet users, and only 8% were in favour of the mandatory filter.

In May 2010, the results of a study commissioned by the Safer Internet Group (consisting of Google, Internet Industry Association, iiNet, Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Library and Information Association) were published. 39 people participated in four focus group interviews. The study consisted of four focus-group interviews of 39 participants and found that while people were aware of the pending legislation, they did not understand its details. When details of the government&#x27;s proposal was explained, along with the possible alternatives, enthusiasm for the filter dropped.

===Australian Law Reform Commission review===
In July 2010, Justice Minister Robert McClelland ordered the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to review the criteria for the &quot;refused classification&quot; (RC) category, while also conducting public consultation and evaluating the practices and codes of companies in the sector.

The ALRC&#x27;s report, released in February 2012, includes recommendations that:
* Type of content targeted by filtering rules should focus on adult content
* Content should be censored by ISPs only when it is defined as &quot;prohibited&quot;
* Government review prohibitions on &quot;the depiction of sexual fetishes in films and detailed instruction in the use of proscribed drugs&quot;
* Ban on content that &quot;promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime&quot; be limited only to serious crime
* New media content classification act should be enacted to cover the classification of all media in Australia on any platform, and spell out how those responsible for content, including Internet service providers, should rank prohibited content
* Because of the large number of online media organisations, it would not be possible to classify everything and ISPs should &quot;take reasonable steps&quot; to identify prohibited content, including allowing users to report such content online

===Internet Industry Association filter code===
Internet Industry Association (IIA) had released a filter code on child abuse for the industry. IIA have stated that no new legislation amendments were required because ISPs were installing filters to censor access to facilitate carrying out legal requests under s313 of the Telecommunications Act. However no known code has been publicly released yet.

Internode, TPG and Exetel have been against the scheme, unless the law compels them. iiNet is one notable exception in that they will work with the law, without a position on the scheme. Vodafone is supporting the IIA filter code, but it is unclear whether they will implement it.

===Legality of mandatory filtering for users===
There are concerns that censoring access based on the Interpol blocklist can constitute a criminal act of &quot;impairment of an electronic communication,&quot; according to Peter Black (QUT internet law lecturer), the maximum penalty for which is ten years in prison. There was concerns that since Telstra&#x27;s filter is now live, the telco has not changed the end use agreement about restricting access or notified their customers. Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman stopped short of saying Telstra and Optus breached existing contracts, saying the question was &quot;hypothetical one&quot;.

==Anti-censorship campaigns==
In May 1999 there were national protests against the proposed Federal Internet censorship legislation.

Protests involving hundreds of people were held on 1 November 2008, with people in all capital cities nationwide marching on state Parliaments, and on 13 December 2008, in all capital cities. The Digital Liberty Coalition organised these protests, declaring an intent to rally continuously until censorship as a whole is taken off the table.

The Internet-based political activism organisation, GetUp!, which has previously run mainstream campaigns action against WorkChoices and to free David Hicks, is backing the offline action of the DLC to oppose the web censorship plan. GetUp! first called for donations during December 2008 to raise awareness of Internet censorship in Australia. The group raised an unprecedented $30,000 before the end of the appeal&#x27;s first day.

GetUp! teamed up with award-winning, non-traditional and digital creative agency Fnuky Advertising to launch a campaign in Australia to raise awareness of the Australian Government&#x27;s flawed plans to introduce web censorship. The campaign impersonated the Australian Federal Government by presenting web censorship as a mock consumer product branded as Censordyne, a parody of the toothpaste brand Sensodyne. Fnuky Advertising&#x27;s Creative Director, David Campbell selected toothpaste as the platform for the campaign after Stephen Conroy stated the purpose of web censorship in Australia was to &quot;Fight Moral Decay&quot;. The Censordyne campaign was launched online during July 2009 by a single Twitter post by fake Stephen Conroy, a popular impersonator of the Australian Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy. The campaign featured an online video, a Censordyne product website and a Censordyne search engine. Within 24 hours of launch, the words GetUp and Censordyne were the number 2 and 3 most talked about brands on Twitter worldwide. The campaign received widespread coverage in most major Australian newspapers and news websites. Censordyne become a topic of discussion on Nova 96.9 radio in Sydney and was featured on the Australian ABC television program &quot;Insiders&quot;.

GetUp! raised over $45,000 in donations from the general public during July 2009 to see the Censordyne commercial on TV and on Qantas flights during the month of August 2009, where all Australian politicians would be travelling to Canberra. Following the Censordyne campaign launch, Qantas chose to censor the anti-censorship campaign from their flights.

===Response===
The debate over Internet filtering has incited some tension in Australia, with threatening phone calls and emails being received by advocates of both sides of the debate.

In a speech in January 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accuses countries with Internet censorship of breaching the UN&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Australian filter fits her definition for censorship. Stephen Conroy welcomed Clinton&#x27;s speech, and agrees with her that &quot;freedom of expression has its limits&quot;. Colin Jacobs responded in turn to note that while there are limits to free speech, Clinton had stated that the advantages of the Internet would be jeopardised by introducing censorship. As part of a diplomatic assault by the United States on Internet censorship in many countries, U.S. State Department spokesman Noel Clay has raised concerns about the filter plan with Australian officials.

The leaders of three of Australia&#x27;s largest ISPs (Telstra, iiNet, and Internode) have stated in an interview that the web filtering proposal simply cannot work for various technical, legal and ethical reasons. The managing director of iiNet, Michael Malone, has said of Stephen Conroy: &quot;This is the worst Communications Minister we&#x27;ve had in the 15 years since the [Internet] industry has existed&quot;, and plans to sign up his ISP for participation in live filtering trials by 24 December to provide the government with &quot;hard numbers&quot; demonstrating &quot;how stupid it [the filtering proposal] is&quot;.

Dale Clapperton, then chairperson of EFA, argued that the Labor party cannot implement the clean feed proposal without either new legislation and the support of the Australian Senate, or the assistance of the Internet Industry Association. As the Liberals and Greens have both stated that they will not support legislation, it can only be implemented with the support of the IIA.

International lobby group Netchoice, which is backed by companies including eBay, Time Warner, Oracle Corporation and some trade associations, is likely to oppose the mandatory filter. Google opposes the filter primarily because the scope of content to be filtered is too wide, and is likely to delay the introduction of Google TV to Australia because of technical concerns about the filter.

Internode engineer Mark Newton was the subject of a letter of complaint from Stephen Conroy&#x27;s office for his participation in a Whirlpool forum showing the negative impact of the filter on Internet access speeds.

Some child welfare groups including Save the Children and the National Children&#x27;s &amp; Youth Law Centre have criticised the filtering plan as ineffective, stating that resources would be better spent elsewhere, and agreeing with the opposing position presented by Australia&#x27;s ISPs. Other child welfare groups continue to support the filters. In 2008, ChildWise defended the plan as &quot;a victory for common sense&quot;.

NSW Young Labor has abandoned the web filtering plan, passing a motion rejecting Conroy&#x27;s plans, and calling on him to adopt a voluntary, opt-in system.

Colin Jacobs, vice-chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering were illustrated by the problems in the UK caused by the blocking of a single Wikipedia page. He also said of the IWF blocklist: &quot;In Australia, not only would the Government have the ability to secretly add any site to our blocklist, but an unaccountable foreign-based organisation would as well&quot;.

Conservative South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi does not support the mandatory web filter. He considers Stephen Conroy&#x27;s plan to be &quot;so devoid of detail&quot; that it is impossible to form an opinion on it, and says &quot;Parental responsibility cannot and should not be abrogated to government—if it is, our society will only become weaker ... Yes, illegal content should be banned from the web ... but it is wrong to give the government a blank cheque to determine what is appropriate for us to view on the Internet.&quot; 

Clive Hamilton, a senior ethics professor at the Australian National University whose think tank The Australia Institute was responsible for the initial media attention for a mandatory Internet filter in 2003, argues &quot;The laws that mandate upper speed limits do not stop people from speeding, does that mean that we should not have those laws? ... We live in a society, and societies have always imposed limits on activities that it deems are damaging. There is nothing sacrosanct about the Internet.&quot; Despite proposing the filter, he has been chosen by The Greens to stand in the Federal seat of Higgins.

Retired Justice Michael Kirby believes that it is a bad example for the government of a democratic country like Australia to take control of what people hear and what information they get, and made comparisons to the situation in Iran and Burma.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Reporters Without Borders states that the web filter is not the solution to combating child sex abuse, and the plan entails risks to freedom of expression. The censorship of websites by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority, rather than a Judge, is in contravention of laws. The criteria for censoring &quot;inappropriate&quot; websites is too vague, and it would be a dangerous censorship option to target &quot;Refused classification&quot; sites, many of which are unrelated to sexual abuse. Subjects such as abortion, anorexia, aborigines and legislation on the sale of marijuana would all risk being filtered, as would media reports on these subjects.

The Howard Government commissioned a number of independent technical experts to examine Internet filtering. The resulting report was delivered to the Australian Government in February 2008, and released publicly in December 2008. Professor Bjorn Landfeldt, one of the report&#x27;s authors, stated that filtering technology simply does not work, as it can easily be bypassed and slows access to the Internet by up to 87%. In response, Stephen Conroy has stated that the report involved no empirical testing, and was simply a literature review of material available from other sources; any problems raised by the report would be tested during the filter trials scheduled for mid-January 2009.

A report by Tim Stevens and Peter Neumann for the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) analyses each of the available ISP-based filtering solutions and concludes that they are ineffective in the fight against terror. A hybrid filtering scheme was rated the best, but it is ineffective against dynamic content such as chat pages and instant messaging, and had political implications because it required the existence of a blocklist of censored pages. The report instead advocates the use of takedown notices for extremist content, and prosecutions to &quot;signal that individuals engaged in online extremism are not beyond the law&quot;.

The Metaverse Journal suggests that because web filtering logs every site visit, and some information about who is visiting the site, then it is ripe for abuse by whoever runs the filters. It potentially allows surveillance of any user of the Internet, such as journalists, political opponents, or even the family members of politicians.

Ross Fitzgerald of &quot;The Australian&quot; believes that the filter was not introduced in 2010 to defuse it as an election issue, and that if it is re-introduced into the next parliament it could be even more censorious than the current proposal.

Australian radio presenter and writer Helen Razer dislikes the filter because she enjoys pornography, does not believe it causes harm to adults, and doesn&#x27;t think that children are at much risk:

&quot;I enjoy pornography. Perhaps not quite so much as I enjoy living among citizens who take an entitlement to free speech for granted. But I do like it quite a lot. And it seems that my porn is endangered. If Conroy&#x27;s clean feed works, which some tech sceptics argue that it cannot, it will prevent access to all pornography ... I can report that one doesn&#x27;t simply amble into X-rated or even R18+ material ... I have become adept at this; children, presumably, have not. And if they have, clearly they are the issue of the world&#x27;s most reprehensible parents and should be sent to live with Hetty Johnston forthwith ... Despite the best efforts of some, there is no evidence that pornography will negatively affect me or other consenting adults ... The only lasting effect of my access to porn is a reflex giggle when the pizza delivery man knocks on my door.&quot;

===Attacks on government websites===
On 26 March 2009, the Australian Classification Board&#x27;s website, http://www.classification.gov.au/, was attacked by the Internet group Anonymous, automatically redirecting visitors to a page on the same site with a message mocking censorship efforts with the text:

This site contains information about the boards that have the right to CONTROL YOUR FREEDOMZ. The Classification Board has the right to not just classify content (the name is an ELABORATE TRICK), but also the right to DECIDE WHAT IS AND ISNT APPROPRIATE and BAN CONTENT FROM THE PUBLIC. We are part of an ELABORATE DECEPTION from CHINA to CONTROL AND SHEEPIFY the NATION, to PROTECT THE CHILDREN. All opposers must HATE CHILDREN, and therefore must be KILLED WITH A LARGE MELONS during the PROSECUTION PARTIES IN SEPTEMBER. Come join our ALIEN SPACE PARTY.
In September 2009, the group Anonymous reawakened, in &quot;Operation Didgeridie&quot;, in order to protest the policy of Internet censorship, and on 9 September initiated a Distributed Denial-of-service attack against the prime minister&#x27;s website. As a result of this attack, the site was taken offline for approximately one hour.

On 10 February 2010, the Parliament of Australia&#x27;s website, www.aph.gov.au, was attacked by Anonymous once again. The attacks included distributed denial of service, black faxes, prank calls and spam emails. The attacks commenced at 12 midnight local time and the website was down for over two days. The attack, named &quot;Operation Titstorm&quot; is reportedly in defiance of the government&#x27;s banning of small-breasted women and female ejaculation in pornography. The group called for physical media to be distributed to members of the Australian Labor Party as well as assaulting email addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers with spam and pornographic images that were in the categories to which were going to be filtered by the government&#x27;s policy.

==Other expanded censorship proposals==
In a 2012 &quot;Report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation&quot;, Raymond Finkelstein argued that standards of &quot;accuracy, fairness, impartiality, integrity, and independence&quot; on the part of the press could only be achieved through government control. He proposed the creation of an independent News Media Council covering all platforms (print, online, radio and television) with the power to order changes to published content, publication of a right of reply by anyone or any organisation that makes a complaint, and the publication of an apology. Refusal to comply could result in the author, media organisation, or blogger being accused of contempt, a trial by a court, and the possibility of the fines and / or prison sentences associated with contempt of court findings.

The proposal would have the effect of converting the code of ethics of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) into laws enforceable by the courts. As a result, small publishers and bloggers may feel coerced into publishing corrections or apologies when they lack the time, energy, or resources to defend themselves in court against a contempt charge.

<text>Plymstock is a commuter suburb of Plymouth and former civil parish in the English county of Devon.

==Geography==

Situated on the east bank of the River Plym, Plymstock is geographically and historically part of the South Hams. It comprises the villages Billacombe, Elburton, Goosewell, Hooe, Mount Batten, Oreston, Pomphlett, Staddiscombe, Turnchapel and Plymstock proper, the centrally located village after which the parish and suburb is named. The parish church is St Mary and All Saints.

The pedestrianised 1960s Broadway consists of a number of shops, including an Iceland supermarket within the precinct and a Lidl supermarket nearby, three banks, six estate agents&#x27; and other local amenities including a library, a fire station and a small police station.

At Pomphlett, there is a Morrisons superstore and drive-through McDonald&#x27;s burger restaurant. The population at the time of the 2001 Census was recorded at 24,103 with 11,652 owner occupied homes in the PL9 postcode area. The total population in 2011 increased to 24,758

==History==
The earliest surviving documentary reference to the place is as &quot;Plemestocha&quot; in the Domesday Book and its name is derived from Old English meaning either &quot;outlying farm with a plum-tree&quot; or, if it is short for &quot;Plympton Stock&quot;, &quot;outlying farm belonging to Plympton&quot;.

The local branch railways through the area to Turnchapel and Yealmpton have been removed, the bridges and stations demolished, and the land built on. Pomphlett Mill has been demolished and the site used for a roundabout. Pomphlett Creek (shown right), once a popular rowing stretch has been partly filled in and what remains is largely silted up.

Until the 20th century Plymstock was a rural parish but began to develop rapidly just before and after the Second World War as a residential area outside Plymouth but acting as a dormitory area for the city. In 1961 the parish had a population of 14,700. On 1 April 1967, Plymstock, along with Plympton, was absorbed into the City of Plymouth and today, like Plympton, forms a populous and mostly home-owning south-eastern suburb of the city.

==Amenities==

There are numerous public spaces including a huge public sports area at Staddiscombe. There are three rugby pitches at Elburton, there is a major golf club at Staddon Heights and a commercial driving range near Elburton.

There are many state primary schools in the area and two very large comprehensive schools, Coombe Dean School and Plymstock School. There is one nearby independent school in the city, and children who choose to take and get a very high pass in the 11+ exam can attend one of the three grammar schools in Plymouth.

In 2008, Coombe Dean School achieved national notoriety after a popular school plan to erect two generating windmills was blocked by local councillors following opposition by residents of surrounding bungalows.

Frequent buses connect most areas of Plymstock with routes across the city linking with the railway station and Derriford hospital. There is a water taxi linking Mount Batten with Plymouth Barbican.

==Folklore==

Childe&#x27;s Tomb on Dartmoor is the legendary site of the death of Childe who, caught in a snowstorm, killed and disembowelled his horse and climbed inside for shelter, but still froze to death. He left a message to say that the first person to bury him would get his lands at Plymstock. The greedy monks of Tavistock buried him and claimed the lands. The ghosts of monks carrying a bier have supposedly been seen at Childe&#x27;s Tomb.
