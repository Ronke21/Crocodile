<doc id="991058" wikidata="Q2902628" url="?curid=991058" title="Horn section">
<text>A horn section is a group of musicians playing horns. In an orchestra or concert band, it refers to the musicians who play the &quot;French&quot; horn, and in a British-style brass band it is the tenor horn players. In many popular music genres, the term is applied loosely to any group of woodwind or brass instruments, or a combination of woodwinds and brass.

==Symphonic==
In a symphony orchestra, the horn section is the group of symphonic musicians who play the French horn (or German horn or Vienna horn). These musicians are typically seated to the back of the ensemble and may be on either side at the director&#x27;s discretion. Placing them to the left with their bells toward the audience increases the prominence of the section, whereas on the right, the sound reflects off the back of the stage. Most of the time, players are seated right to left from the director&#x27;s view based on seating, with the principal horn (first horn) being seated on the right and fourth horn seated on the left. The section is ordered in this way so the principal horn may be heard by all players, as the principal sets the timbre and intonation of the section.

==Popular music==

Horn sections are an integral part of musical genres such as jazz, R&amp;B, blues, soul, funk, calypso, Afrobeat, and gospel. Most of these horn sections feature some combination of saxophones, trumpets and trombones. More rarely, other wind or brass instruments such as flute, clarinet or tuba may be added. Other popular musical genres, such as rock, pop, hip-hop, latin, and country music also use horn sections. When only woodwinds are involved, the term &quot;reed section&quot; is often used, even when flutes are included .

===Notable horn sections===
Horn sections in blues bands and funk groups may be composed of session musicians playing arranged parts, or they may be a consistent group of musicians. A small number of horn sections use a consistent group of musicians who become well known as a unit.

*Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop

<text>Jeannie Robertson (born Regina Christina Robertson; 21 October 1908 – 13 March 1975) was a Scottish folk singer.

She is known for her version of the traditional song &quot;I&#x27;m a Man You Don&#x27;t Meet Every Day&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Jock Stewart&quot;, which was covered by Archie Fisher, The Dubliners, The McCalmans, The Tannahill Weavers and The Pogues. Other versions of the song are known from the US in the 1880s and Australia in the 1850s.

==Hamish Henderson and Alan Lomax==
Robertson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and in her early life she sometimes lived at 90 Hilton Road, where a plaque now commemorates her. Like many of the Scottish Travellers from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Ayrshire, she went to Blairgowrie to pick raspberries once a year. Hamish Henderson was born in Blairgowrie and tried to track down the best singers there. In 1953, he followed her reputation to her doorstep in Aberdeen. According to legend Jeannie was reluctant to let him in. She challenged him to tell her the opening line of Child ballad no 163, &quot;The Battle of Harlaw&quot;, and he complied. In November of the same year she was staying in the London apartment of Alan Lomax. In preparation for a TV appearance, Jean Ritchie, Margaret Barry and Isla Cameron were also there. They swapped songs with each other, while the tape rolled. It is sometimes stated that she made the first recording of &quot;The Battle of Harlaw&quot; but this is not so. The first recording was made in 1936 by the Bothy Ballad singer Willie Kemp (for the Beltona label) and it may be from this that she learnt the song. Another of the songs she sang was &quot;Andrew Lammie&quot; (&quot;Mill o&#x27; Tifty&#x27;s Annie&quot;), lasting over 13 minutes. At the end she told Alan Lomax about the parts of the story that she had not sung. Many of the 1953 recordings were issued as &quot;The Queen Among the Heather&quot; in 1975. They later reappeared along with other songs on a CD of the same name.

==Performances==
The television programme was &quot;The Song Hunter&quot;, produced by David Attenborough, who later became controller of BBC Two television. In 1958, Hamish Henderson recorded her in Edinburgh. Those recordings were issued as &quot;Up the Dee and Doon The Don&quot; on the Lismor label. The Traditional Music and Song Association founded the Blairgowrie Festival in 1965, during the fruit picking. The first festival saw Robertson, plus Jimmy MacBeath and other valuable source singers, who learned folk songs without the influence of radios or books. Her 1968 appearance there was issued as part of an anthology on the Topic label. As well as classic ballads, she sang bawdy songs such as &quot;Never Wed an Old Man&quot;. Robertson was awarded the MBE in 1968 and died on 13 March 1975.

==Related folk musicians==
Robertson&#x27;s daughter Lizzie Higgins issued an album in 1975: &quot;Up and Awa&#x27; wi&#x27; the Laverock&quot;. Stanley Robertson, a storyteller, ballad singer and piper from Aberdeen, was Jeannie&#x27;s nephew. Carmen Higgins, ex-fiddler with the Aberdeen folk band, Rock Salt and Nails, is also closely related to her. Carmen Higgins has played with Old Blind Dogs, recorded a solo CD, and has appeared regularly on television, radio and in the press. Joss Cameron, a folk singer from Edinburgh is related to her, and still performs Jeannie Robertson ballads. 

Maggie Stewart (1902-1983), Jeannie Robertson&#x27;s aunt, was recorded singing many traditional ballads and telling stories which can be heard via the Tobar an Dualchais website.

In the early 1960s, the folk-singer Andy Hunter learned songs and storytelling from Jeannie Robertson and her family while studying French at the University of Aberdeen.

<text>The baculum (: bacula), also known as the penis bone, penile bone, os penis, os genitale, or os priapi, is a bone in the penis of many placental mammals. It is not present in humans, but is present in the penises of some primates, such as the gorilla and the chimpanzee. The baculum arises from primordial cells in soft tissues of the penis, and its formation is largely influenced by androgens. The bone lies above the urethra, and it aids sexual reproduction by maintaining stiffness during sexual penetration. The homologue to the baculum in female mammals is the baubellum (&quot;os clitoridis&quot;), a bone in the clitoris.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;baculum&quot; means &quot;stick&quot; or &quot;staff&quot; in Latin and originates from , &quot;baklon&quot; &quot;stick&quot;.

== Function ==
The baculum is used for copulation and varies in size and shape by species. Its evolution may be influenced by sexual selection, and its characteristics are sometimes used to differentiate between similar species. A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a long time with a female, which can be a distinct advantage in some mating strategies. The length of the baculum may be related to the duration of copulation in some species. In carnivorans and primates, the length of the baculum appears to be influenced by postcopulatory sexual selection. In some bat species, the baculum can also protect the urethra from compression.

== Presence in mammals ==
The baculum is absent in monotreme (egg-laying) and marsupial (pouch-bearing) mammals. Mammals having a penile bone include various eutherians (placental mammals):
* Order Primates, although not in humans, lorises, spider monkeys, or woolly monkeys
* Order Rodentia (rodents), though not in the related order Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, etc.)
* Order Eulipotyphla (insectivores, including shrews and hedgehogs)
* Order Carnivora (including members of many well-known families, such as ursids (bears), canids (dogs), pinnipeds (walruses, seals, sea lions), procyonids (raccoons etc.), mustelids (otters, weasels, skunks and others). The baculum is usually longer in the Canoidea than in the Feloidea, although fossas have long bacula and giant pandas have short bacula. However, the baculum is notably absent in carnivorans such as hyenas and binturongs
* Order Chiroptera (bats).

Within Eutheria, the penile bone is absent in ungulates (hoofed mammals, including cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises)), elephants, lagomorphs, and sirenians among others.

Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved 9 times and lost in 10 separate lineages. The baculum is an exclusive characteristic of placentals and closely related eutherians, being absent in other mammal clades, and it has been speculated to be derived from the epipubic bones more widely spread across mammals, but notoriously absent in placentals.

Among the primates, marmosets, weighing around , have a baculum measuring around , while the tiny galago has one around long. The great apes, despite their size, tend to have very small penis bones, and humans are the only ones to have lost them altogether.

In some mammalian species, such as badgers and raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), the baculum can be used to determine relative age. If a raccoon&#x27;s baculum tip is made up of uncalcified cartilage, has a porous base, is less than in mass, and measures less than long, then the baculum belongs to a juvenile.

== Absence in humans ==
Unlike most primates, humans lack a baculum, but the bone is present, although much reduced, among other great apes. In many ape species, it is a relatively insignificant structure. Cases of human penis ossification following trauma have been reported, and one case was reported of a congenital os penis surgically removed from a 5-year-old boy, who also had other developmental abnormalities, including a cleft scrotum. Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach in &quot;Patterns of Sexual Behavior&quot; (1951), p. 30 say, &quot;Both gorillas and chimpanzees possess a penile bone. In the latter species, the os penis is located in the lower part of the organ and measures approximately three-quarters of an inch in length.&quot; In humans, the rigidity of the erection is provided entirely through blood pressure in the corpora cavernosa. An &quot;artificial baculum&quot; or penile implant is sometimes used to treat erectile dysfunction in humans.

In &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Richard Dawkins proposed honest advertising as the evolutionary explanation for the loss of the baculum. The hypothesis states that if erection failure is a sensitive early warning of ill health (physical or mental), females could have gauged the health of a potential mate based on his ability to achieve erection without the support of a baculum.

The tactile stimulation hypothesis proposes that the loss of the baculum in humans is linked to the female choice for tactile stimulation: a boneless penis would be more flexible, facilitating a larger range of copulatory positions and whole body movement, giving females greater general physical stimulation.
The mating system shift hypothesis proposes that the shift towards monogamy as the dominant reproductive strategy may have reduced the intensity of copulatory and post-copulatory sexual selection, and made the baculum obsolete.

Humans &quot;evolved a mating system in which the male tended to accompany a particular female all the time to try to ensure paternity of her children&quot; which allows for frequent matings of short duration. Observation suggests that primates with a baculum only infrequently encounter females, but engage in longer periods of copulation that the baculum makes possible, thereby maximizing their chances of fathering the female&#x27;s offspring. Human females exhibit concealed ovulation, also known as hidden estrus, meaning it is almost impossible to tell when the female is fertile (unless the cervical mucus is examined), so frequent matings would be necessary to ensure paternity.

Strengths and weaknesses of these hypotheses were revised in a 2021 study, which also proposed an alternative hypothesis: that conspecific aggression, in combination with the development of self-awareness, may have played a role in the loss. If the presence of a baculum exacerbated the prevalence and severity of penile injuries resulting from blunt trauma to a flaccid penis, increasing ability to foresee the consequences of their actions would also enable hominins to realise that these injuries are a useful tool in male-male competition. This behavioural innovation, planned conspecific aggression with the goal of temporary exclusion of competitors from the breeding pool, would create an environment in which a genetic mutation for a penis without a baculum (or with an unossified baculum) would strongly increase the fitness of the mutant phenotype. Along with the hominin propensity for social learning and cultural transmission, this hypothetical scenario may explain why this phenotype became fixed in all human populations.

An alternative view is that its loss in humans is an example of neoteny during human evolution; late-stage fetal chimpanzees lack a baculum.

== Cultural significance ==
It has been argued that the &quot;rib&quot; (Hebrew &quot;ṣēlāʿ&quot;, also translated &quot;flank&quot; or &quot;side&quot;) in the story of Adam and Eve is actually a mistranslation of a Biblical Hebrew euphemism for baculum, and that its removal from Adam in the Book of Genesis is a creation story to explain this absence (as well as the presence of the perineal raphe – as a resultant &quot;scar&quot;) in humans.

In Hoodoo, the folk magic of the American South, the raccoon baculum is sometimes worn as an amulet for love or luck.

=== Oosik ===

&quot;Oosik&quot; (Iñupiaq: &quot;usuk&quot; or &quot;uzuk&quot;) is a term used in Alaska Native cultures to describe the bacula of walruses, seals, sea lions and polar bears. Sometimes as long as , fossilized bacula are often polished and used as a handle for knives and other tools. The &quot;oosik&quot; is a polished and sometimes carved baculum of these large northern carnivores.

&quot;Oosiks&quot; are also sold as tourist souvenirs. In 2007, a fossilized penis bone from an extinct species of walrus, believed by the seller to be the largest in existence, was sold for $8,000.

United States Congressman for Alaska, Don Young, was known for possessing an 18-inch walrus &quot;oosik&quot;, and once brandished it like a sword during a congressional hearing.

<text>Trinity Bridge or the Triangular Bridge is a unique three-way stone arch bridge that stands at the heart of Crowland, Lincolnshire, England. While it once spanned the divergence of the River Welland and a distributary, the rivers have been re-routed, and it now spans nothing significant.

At Crowland the Welland used to split into two channels, one broadly following the present course of the river, and the other joining the Old South Eau to reach the River Nene near Wisbech. The river no longer flows through Crowland, but the triangular bridge, which spanned the junction, remains in the centre of the town.

==History==
The current bridge dates to the 14th century (built between 1360 and 1390) and replaced previous wooden bridges. The earliest known mention of the bridge is by King Æthelbald of Mercia in 716. It was mentioned in a (spurious) 943 charter of Eadred. The bridge is now a scheduled monument and Grade I listed.

The bridge is predominantly built from Barnack stone, which was quarried at Barnack about 10 miles to the west of Crowland, and presumably transported by boat on the Welland.

This bridge has three stairways that converge at the top. Originally it spanned the River Welland and a distributary that flowed through the town, although the rivers were re-routed in the mid-17th century and no longer flow anywhere near the bridge. The bridge was an unusual and economical solution to the crossing of two watercourses at their divergence, reducing the need for three separate bridges to a single structure with three abutments.

In 1952 a watercolour of Trinity Bridge by F. W. Baldwin was used on a menu for the P&amp;O liner . A copy can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum under reference number E.346-2005.

<text>Stephen Richard Wright (26 August 1954 – 12 February 2024) was an English disc jockey, radio personality, and occasional television presenter, credited with introducing the morning zoo format to British radio with a humorous collection of personalities. He presented &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; for 12 years on BBC Radio 1 and 23 years on BBC Radio 2, two of the BBC&#x27;s national radio stations. He continued to present his &quot;Sunday Love Songs&quot; on Radio 2 until his death and, in October 2023, he took over as the host of the long-running &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; chart show. On BBC Television, Wright hosted &quot;Home Truths&quot;, &quot;The Steve Wright People Show&quot;, &quot;Auntie&#x27;s TV Favourites&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;TOTP2&quot;.

Wright won &quot;Best DJ of the Year&quot;, as voted by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; Readers Poll and by &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in 1994. In 1998, he was awarded TRIC Personality of the Year for his radio programmes. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to radio. He was described by Paul Gambaccini as being &quot;among the all-time greats of radio&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Stephen Richard Wright was born on 26 August 1954 in Greenwich, to Richard and June and grew up in New Cross, in South London. He had a brother, Laurence. Their father, Richard, managed the Burton&#x27;s store in Trafalgar Square.

After the family moved to Essex, Wright attended the Eastwood High School for Boys near Southend-on-Sea, where he broadcast a nascent radio show over the speaker system from the stock cupboard. Having finished school with only three Olevels, he worked in maritime insurance and as a local newspaper reporter. He joined the BBC staff in the early 1970s working as a returns clerk in the Gramophone Library in Egton House, opposite Broadcasting House in London, before leaving to start broadcasting in 1976 at Thames Valley Radio Radio 210 in Reading, Berkshire. In 1979, Wright got his big break at Radio Luxembourg, where he presented his own nightly show. He was known for the characters he created and referred to himself as DJ Silly Boy.

==BBC Radio 1==
Wright joined BBC Radio 1 on 5 January 1980, taking over a Saturday evening slot before moving to Saturday mornings later that year.

=== &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot;===
Wright moved to daytime radio with &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; in 1981, later introducing the zoo format to the UK.

The first run of &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; was from 1981 to 1993 on BBC Radio 1. The show had a cast of telephone characters created and performed by Gavin McCoy, Peter Dickson, Richard Easter and Phil Cornwell. Like his mentor, Kenny Everett, Wright went out of his way to be irreverent, including stories taken from the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. The success led to a hit single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, released under the name Arnee and the Terminaters. In later years, the style changed, dumping most of the characters and instead having a &quot;zoo&quot; format with spoof guests and comedy sketches. A &quot;posse&quot; of producers and radio staff joined in. Another regular character was &quot;Mr Angry from Purley&quot;.

In 1984 Wright took over a Sunday morning show entitled &quot;Steve Wright on Sunday&quot;, which meant he presented weekday afternoons Mondays to Thursdays, with Mark Page and Paul Jordan presenting Friday afternoon&#x27;s show. In 1986 his Sunday morning show ended, and he returned to five afternoons a week.

The Smiths&#x27; 1986 hit single &quot;Panic&quot; was inspired by Wright playing &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; by Wham! following a news bulletin about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Johnny Marr and Morrissey were listening and were disturbed by the contrast in tone. The song&#x27;s lyrics about the event finished; &quot;Hang the DJ&quot; and this slogan appeared on a promotional T-shirt above a picture of Wright. The DJ took it well and bought one of the T-shirts.

=== &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot;===
Wright and his Posse moved to &quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; in 1994. He resigned from the Breakfast Show in 1995 due to differences with the BBC Radio 1 management and a fall in ratings. This coincided with many of the more established DJs leaving, or being sacked, around this time.

==Commercial radio==
Wright was picked up by the new station Talk Radio in 1995, where he presented a Saturday morning show. He also presented a Sunday morning show, which was heard on a number of GWR radio stations around the UK.

==BBC World Service==
Wright joined the BBC World Service on 5 January 1999, presenting a 1-hour programme, &quot;Wright Around The World&quot;. This show ran every Saturday afternoon until the final show on 25 October 2003. This meant that he was now broadcasting on BBC Radio for seven days a week.

==BBC Radio 2 ==
Wright joined BBC Radio 2 in March 1996, where he began presenting &quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Saturday Show&quot; (1996–1999), &quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Sunday Love Songs&quot; (1996–2024, his death), and his afternoon show beginning in July 1999 until September 2022. In 2006, Wright was said to earn £440,000 a year at Radio 2. In 2018–2019, Wright&#x27;s salary was between £465,000 and £469,000, making him the BBC&#x27;s fifth-highest-earning presenter. He had taken an £85,000 pay cut from the year before, however, as part of an effort to equalise male and female pay.

===&quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot;===
In mid-1999 following a shake-up at Radio 2, &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; was revived, with Wright taking over this slot from Ed Stewart. Jonathan Ross took over Wright&#x27;s Saturday morning slot.

Wright presented his Radio 2 version of &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; on weekday afternoons from 2pm to 5pm, alongside Tim Smith and Janey Lee Grace, who have both also occasionally appeared as relief presenters on the station, as well as traffic reporter Bobbie Pryor. Another frequent contributor, &quot;The Old Woman&quot;, was played by Joyce Frost who died in November 2016. Smith and Wright would regularly present &quot;factoids&quot;, described as &quot;gleaming nuggets of information so incredible that they really shouldn&#x27;t be true, but are!&quot;

On 1 July 2022, Wright announced that the show would end in September, to be replaced by a new show with Scott Mills. Wright would remain on Radio 2 to continue hosting &quot;Sunday Love Songs&quot;, along with a new &quot;Serious Jockin″&quot; podcast, seasonal specials and other projects. The final show was broadcast on 30 September 2022, with Wright playing &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; by Queen as his last record.

===&quot;Sunday Love Songs&quot;===
&quot;Sunday Love Songs&quot;, which Wright presented solo on Sunday mornings on Radio 2 from 31 March 1996 until 11 February 2024, the day before his death, featured a blend of classic love songs, dedications and real-life romance stories. In 2013, the BBC Trust&#x27;s editorial standards committee criticised the show for breaches of guidelines on accuracy and audience interaction, after media reporting revealed that the show was in fact recorded on Fridays.

Wright&#x27;s final broadcast, on the day before his death, but recorded two days earlier, was a special Valentine&#x27;s Day edition of this show. The following week, a special programme aired, hosted by Liza Tarbuck, reading out messages from people who had a dedication from Wright over the last 28 years of Sunday Love Songs, and playing a selection of Wright&#x27;s favourite tracks. The show continued with temporary host Nicki Chapman from 25 February, and it was announced that Michael Ball would be taking over the programme on 2 June 2024.

===&quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Summer Nights&quot;===
Between 21st and 24th of August 2023, Wright took over the evening show for a week to host &quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Summer Nights&quot; between 7 and 9pm.

===&quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;===
On 10 August 2023, it was announced that Wright would become the new host of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;, from 14 October 2023, replacing Paul Gambaccini. He presented the show until 10 February 2024. On 15 April, it was announced that Mark Goodier would take over the show in July. Gary Davies took over this programme during the interim period.

==Career outside radio==
From 1980 to 1989, Wright was a regular presenter on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Wright also presented a BBC TV series, &quot;The Steve Wright People Show&quot;, from 1994 to 1995. His next stint in television was as the narrator and writer of the retro pop show &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; between 1997 and 2009. The last episode of &quot;TOTP2&quot; he presented was the Michael Jackson special broadcast on 27 June 2009.

===UK Chart Hits===
Whilst a radio presenter on BBC Radio 1, Wright was involved in a number of UK chart hits with members of his Afternoon Posse (the drive time radio team) including the UK Top 10 hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot; which featured Wright as one of the backing band, &#x27;the Terminaters&#x27;, on 29 August 1991 edition of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

==Accolades==
Wright won awards, including &quot;Best DJ of the Year&quot; as voted by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; Readers Poll and by &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in 1994. In 1998 he was awarded TRIC Personality of the Year for his radio programmes.

Wright was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to radio.

== Personal life ==
Wright was married in 1985 to Cyndi Robinson, an American journalist he had met when working in Reading. The couple had two children and they divorced in 1999.

Wright lived in Marylebone, London, close to Broadcasting House. In July 2019, he told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that he did not have time to look for a new partner, because he worked so much on his radio programmes. He said, &quot;I work on an afternoon show on the BBC, and I do a love songs show at the weekend, and it means that I do a lot of interviews, and I prep a lot and I write a lot. So I have to work all the time.&quot; He revealed that the Rolling Stones were his favourite music act. He was rumoured to be allergic to feathers and penicillin and had spoken out about his weight issues.

=== Death ===
Wright died on 12 February 2024, aged 69, at his home in Marylebone, London. The London Ambulance Service responded to an incident at 10:07 that morning; Wright was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said that the death was &quot;unexpected&quot;, but was not being treated as suspicious. His death was announced by his family the following day.

Following his death, it was reported that Wright had undergone undisclosed heart bypass surgery in 2022. Wright&#x27;s brother blamed his death on an unhealthy diet and said that he had been reluctant to discuss health issues. Friends of Wright have suggested that he struggled to come to terms with ex-wife Cyndi&#x27;s death in 2020, at her home in Midhurst, West Sussex during the COVID-19 pandemic.

His death was first reported on BBC Radio 2 during 13 February&#x27;s 5pm bulletin, by newsreader Mike Powell who regularly read the news on Steve Wright&#x27;s afternoon show. Tributes were then led, on air, by fellow Radio 2 DJ Sara Cox. His colleague Tony Blackburn wrote on X, and spoke on the &quot;PM&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4, Sky News and &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; of his long friendship with Wright. BBC director-general Tim Davie described Wright as &quot;...a truly wonderful broadcaster who has been a huge part of so many of our lives over many decades... He was the ultimate professional – passionate about the craft of radio and deeply in touch with his listeners.&quot;

On 16 February, the BBC announced a special schedule of programming, across TV and radio, to remember Wright.

In May 2024, it was revealed that no funeral or cremation had yet taken place for Wright.

On 9 July 2024, it was reported that Wright&#x27;s death certificate stated that his death was due to a ruptured ulcer in his stomach.

The death certificate stated that the causes of death were acute peritonitis and a perforated gastric peptic ulcer.

<text>Over the Rhine is an American, Ohio-based folk music band that was formed in 1989 by Linford Detweiler, Karin Bergquist, Ric Hordinski, and Brian Kelley.

Over the years, they have toured and recorded in many variations. Over the Rhine is now primarily Bergquist (vocals, acoustic guitar, piano) and Detweiler (keyboards, electric bass, vocals) accompanied by complementary musicians on albums and tours. 

Over the course of the band&#x27;s existence, they have recorded at least 15 studio albums and have shared the stage with Bob Dylan, John Prine, Adrian Belew, Squeeze, Ani DiFranco, My Morning Jacket, Hem, and Cowboy Junkies. In 2016, they hosted the first annual Nowhere Else Festival on their farm in southwest Ohio. 

==History==

=== Formation and 1990s ===
The band&#x27;s namesake and place of origin is the Cincinnati, Ohio, neighborhood Over-the-Rhine. Karin attended school in Barnesville, Ohio and graduated from Barnesville High School in 1984. She then went to Malone University, located in Canton, Ohio, where she met Linford. 

Over the Rhine formed in the spring of 1989, as a quartet with Detweiler, Bergquist, and guitarist Ric Hordinski and drummer Brian Kelley. At the time, Detweiler, Hordinski, and Kelley were also touring as part of the final incarnation of Servant. Over the Rhine independently released their first two albums,&quot;Till We Have Faces,&quot; in 1991 (named for the C. S. Lewis book of the same title) and &quot;Patience&quot; in 1992. Later in 1992, Over the Rhine signed with label giant I.R.S. Records, and their first two albums were re-issued&quot;.&quot; In 1994, I.R.S. fully funded the band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Eve&quot;, which was released to rave reviews. 

When I.R.S. records was bought out in 1996, Over the Rhine was released from their five-album contract and went on to independently release &quot;Good Dog, Bad Dog&quot; and &quot;The Darkest Night of the Year,&quot; both of which outsold the three previous I.R.S. releases combined. Hordinski left the band in December 1996, while Kelley continued to play into 1997 before departing. Karin and Linford were married in the fall of 1996 in Cincinnati. 

=== 2000s ===
Between 1999 and 2004, Linford recorded and released three solo projects composed of home-recorded acoustic, piano-based music.

In 2001, Over the Rhine signed with Virgin Records/Back Porch and released &quot;Films for Radio&quot; to critical acclaim. 

They released double album &quot;Ohio&quot; in 2003. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine granted one of its first five-star reviews to &quot;Ohio&quot; and listed it as #26 of &quot;The 50 Best Albums of the 2000s&quot;, calling it &quot;more than simply a dense, rich, vulnerable collection of songs; it’s a dirt road companion on that difficult journey inward, upward&quot;. 

Due to issues within their marriage, Detweiler and Bergquist decided to cancel their tour in support of &quot;Ohio.&quot; They considered divorce but after attending marriage counseling, they ultimately chose to reconcile. The songs on their next album, &quot;Drunkard&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (2005), tell the story of that difficult period in their marriage. They recorded the album entirely in their living room in Norwood, Ohio, and decided to move to a new home soon after.

In June 2006, &quot;Paste&quot; named Over the Rhine as #74 of &quot;100 Best Living Songwriters&quot;, saying that their &quot;understated writing style [...] constantly puts the maxim “less is more” to the test—and succeeds.&quot;

A limited edition live album titled &quot;Live From Nowhere, Volume 1&quot; was released in April 2006. A second limited edition live album, &quot;Live From Nowhere, Volume 2&quot; was released in March 2007, just over a month after &quot;Discount Fireworks&quot;. 

In 2007, Over the Rhine started their own independent label, Great Speckled Dog (named after their Great Dane, Elroy).&quot;The Trumpet Child&quot; and the &quot;Live From Nowhere&quot; series have been released on Great Speckled Dog. 

In January 2008, &quot;Paste&quot;&#x27;s video podcast interviewed Over the Rhine and featured a live performance. The original foursome reunited in December 2008 at The Taft Theatre (in Cincinnati) to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the formation of the band, and again in the summer of 2010 at Ric&#x27;s studio, &quot;the Monastery&quot;, to play the album &quot;Good Dog Bad Dog&quot; live, in its entirety.

=== 2010s ===
Over the Rhine&#x27;s album &quot;The Long Surrender&quot; was released nationally on February 8, 2011, on the band&#x27;s own Great Speckled Dog label. It was recorded in California with producer Joe Henry, and contains a duet with Lucinda Williams on &quot;Undamned&quot; and two songs co-written with Joe Henry. &quot;Paste&quot; named Over the Rhine&#x27;s &quot;The Long Surrender&quot; one of the Top 50 Best Records of the year.

Over the Rhine&#x27;s album &quot;Meet Me at the Edge of the World&quot; is a double album that was produced by Joe Henry. The songs were recorded in two sessions at The Garfield House in South Pasadena in 2013: disc one, &quot;Sacred Ground&quot;, March 28–30 and disc two, &quot;Blue Jean Sky&quot;, April 1–3. Aimee Mann appears as a special guest vocalist on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Bastards Get You Down&quot;. The album was released nationally on September 3, 2013. In their review, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rated the album 3.5 out of 4 stars and stated: &quot;Over the Rhine seems to inhabit another time, one that sounds awfully appealing here.&quot;

On March 15, 2019, Over the Rhine released &quot;Love &amp; Revelation&quot;, on their own Great Speckled Dog Record label. The album was produced by the band and recorded and mixed by Ryan Freeland. The first single from the album, the title track, was premiered by &quot;Paste&quot; almost two months earlier. The album premiered on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; along with a brief article about the album and the duo&#x27;s creative process. The album was met with critical acclaim from sources including &quot;No Depression&quot; and Associated Press, who wrote &quot;&quot;Love &amp; Revelation&quot; is a subdued but lovely celebration...It won&#x27;t surprise longtime fans that the topics are often sad and the tempos mostly slow, all the better to showcase Bergquist&#x27;s warm, wise, honest alto. She sounds better than ever, with a depth and richness that makes her voice resonate like a prayer.&quot;

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, Cincinnati Pops Orchestra featured Over the Rhine in their special July 4 livestream alongside Melinda Doolittle.

In 2023, Detweiler and Bergquist produced Joshua Thomas&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Wings Outside&quot; (2024). It was recorded at Nowhere Else, their recording studio and performing arts space. 

In 2024, Over the Rhine released two albums on their website. &quot;Hymn Time in the Land of Abandon&quot; is a collection of hymns, while &quot;Ten Songs without Words&quot; is a solo piano album by Detweiler. 

== Nowhere Farm and Nowhere Else Festival ==
Around 2005, Detweiler and Bergquist moved to a farm in rural southwest Ohio, which they dubbed the Nowhere Farm. In 2015, they began raising funds to renovate a nearby 140-year-old barn in Martinsville, Ohio, into a recording studio and performing arts space called Nowhere Else. Over the Rhine hosted the first Nowhere Else Festival on Memorial Day weekend of 2016. The event has happened every year except for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2021, it has been held on Labor Day Weekend. The festival has featured artists like Patty Griffin, Mary Gauthier, Joe Henry, Allison Russell, James McMurtry, John Paul White, Birds of Chicago, Leigh Nash, Lily &amp; Madeleine, and Valerie June.

<text>A line driver is an electronic amplifier circuit designed for driving a load such as a transmission line. The amplifier&#x27;s output impedance may be matched to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

Line drivers are commonly used within digital systems, e.g. to communicate digital signals across circuit-board traces and cables.

In analog audio, a line driver is typically used to drive line-level analog signal outputs, for example to connect a CD player to an amplified speaker system.

<text>West Cross is a suburban area of Swansea, Wales, located to the south of Swansea city centre, near Mumbles falling within the West Cross ward.

==Description==
A high majority of the homes are Council built, but many have been sold to the occupiers in the Council&#x27;s right to buy policy scheme during the 1970s and 1980s. Along with homes being bought, the Council had to upgrade a number of the houses during the 1980s, as they were of the BISF (British Iron and Steel Federation) prefabricated design and had to be brought up to current safety standards by removing asbestos insulation and replacing the structure rods. Along with the Council designed/built homes, private homes were built (by home development companies) from the 1950s and 1960s onwards. The area also includes: two parks, three schools, two pubs and various small (convenience) stores. The area is also home to a Territorial Army centre.

===Education===
Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Llwynderw, a Welsh-medium primary school, relocated from its temporary premises in Singleton Park to West Cross Lane in West Cross in September 2008. The school serves the Swansea West area and is now housed in modern purpose built premises at West Cross. In 2017 it had 330 students. UNICEF gave the school a Level Two Rights Respecting Award because the school prohibits employees from yelling at students.

<text>Harold Davenport FRS (30 October 1907 – 9 June 1969) was an English mathematician, known for his extensive work in number theory.

==Early life and education==
Born on 30 October 1907 in Huncoat, Lancashire, Davenport was educated at Accrington Grammar School, the University of Manchester (graduating in 1927), and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a research student of John Edensor Littlewood, working on the question of the distribution of quadratic residues.

==First steps in research==
The attack on the distribution question leads quickly to problems that are now seen to be special cases of those on local zeta-functions, for the particular case of some special hyperelliptic curves such as formula_1.

Bounds for the zeroes of the local zeta-function immediately imply bounds for sums formula_2, where χ is the Legendre symbol &quot;modulo&quot; a prime number &quot;p&quot;, and the sum is taken over a complete set of residues mod &quot;p&quot;.

In the light of this connection it was appropriate that, with a Trinity research fellowship, Davenport in 1932–1933 spent time in Marburg and Göttingen working with Helmut Hasse, an expert on the algebraic theory. This produced the work on the Hasse–Davenport relations for Gauss sums, and contact with Hans Heilbronn, with whom Davenport would later collaborate. In fact, as Davenport later admitted, his inherent prejudices against algebraic methods (&quot;what can you &quot;do&quot; with algebra?&quot;) probably limited the amount he learned, in particular in the &quot;new&quot; algebraic geometry and Artin/Noether approach to abstract algebra.

He proved in 1946 that 8436 is the largest tetrahedral number of the form formula_3 for some nonnegative integers formula_4 and formula_5 and also in 1947 that 5040 is the largest factorial of the form formula_6 for some integer formula_7 by using Brun sieve and other advanced methods.

==Later career==
He took an appointment at the University of Manchester in 1937, just at the time when Louis Mordell had recruited émigrés from continental Europe to build an outstanding department. He moved into the areas of diophantine approximation and geometry of numbers. These were fashionable, and complemented the technical expertise he had in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method; he was later, though, to let drop the comment that he wished he&#x27;d spent more time on the Riemann hypothesis.

He was President of the London Mathematical Society from 1957 to 1959. After professorial positions at the University of Wales and University College London, he was appointed to the Rouse Ball Chair of Mathematics in Cambridge in 1958. There he remained until his death, of lung cancer.

==Personal life==
Davenport married Anne Lofthouse, whom he met at the University College of North Wales at Bangor in 1944; they had two children, Richard and James, the latter going on to become Hebron and Medlock Professor of Information Technology at the University of Bath.

==Influence==
From about 1950, Davenport was the obvious leader of a &quot;school&quot;, somewhat unusually in the context of British mathematics. The successor to the school of mathematical analysis of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood, it was also more narrowly devoted to number theory, and indeed to its analytic side, as had flourished in the 1930s. This implied problem-solving, and hard-analysis methods. The outstanding works of Klaus Roth and Alan Baker exemplify what this can do, in diophantine approximation. Two reported sayings, &quot;the problems are there&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t care how you get hold of the gadget, I just want to know how big or small it is&quot;, sum up the attitude, and could be transplanted today into any discussion of combinatorics. This concrete emphasis on problems stood in sharp contrast with the abstraction of Bourbaki, who were then active just across the English Channel.

<text>A charmstone or coldstone is a stone or mineral artifact of various types associated with various traditional cultures, including those of Scotland and the native cultures of California and the American southwest. Typically they are elongated or cylindrical and have been shaped by grinding or other human activity, and may be perforated and/or grooved. They are thought to have been regarded as having some religious or magical function, including being talismans, amulets or charms.

Typically, references to American examples use the single word &quot;charmstone&quot;, while references to Scottish ones break the term as &quot;charm-stone&quot; or &quot;charm stone&quot;.

==Scotland==
Scottish charm-stones are typically large smooth rounded pieces of rock crystal or other forms of quartz. They were credited with healing or quasi-magical powers, often through water that the charmstone had been dipped into, which was considered efficacious against various ills of both humans and farm animals. The Brooch of Lorn is an example of a charmstone set into a very elaborate brooch in the late 16th century, and worn by clan chiefs.

It is likely that Scottish painted pebbles, which have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD (the Pictish period) also functioned as charm-stones, often known as &quot;cold-stones&quot;. Such stones were used within living memory (1971) against sickness in animals and humans. Robert Burns&#x27;s Highland Mary is said to have been treated using charm-stones when she lay dying at Greenock in 1786. Some superstitious friends believed that her illness was due to someone casting the evil eye upon her; her father was urged to go to a place where two streams met, select seven smooth stones, boil them in milk, and treat her with the potion.

In the &quot;Life of St. Columba&quot; it is recorded that he visited King Bridei in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and took a white stone pebble from the River Ness which he blessed, so that any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It is said to have floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others. The belief in charm-stones is also well documented in medieval Iceland (Proc Soc Antiq Scot). Examples of such stones are held at National Museum of Rural Life, Kittochside, near East Kilbride, and the example set in the Lochbuy or Lochbuie Brooch is in the British Museum.

==Northern England==
As late as the 19th century, stones from Ireland were considered efficacious against snake-bites in northern England, presumably because Ireland is famously free of snakes. Apparently any stone would do, so long as it came from Ireland; failing that, Irish sticks and Irish horse-teeth would work, and live cattle from Ireland were also believed to have active powers against snakes, to kill or paralyze them.

==Native American==
Unlike fetishes they are not figural. Their purpose has been the subject of varying interpretations; researchers have speculated that they might have been fishing weights or have some other utilitarian purpose, but ethnographic research has tended towards the view that they have shamanistic or other ritual use. There have been attempts to establish a typology of charmstones according to form in hopes of providing chronological or cultural markers.

<text>Francis Wayne Sinatra (; January 10, 1944 – March 16, 2016), known professionally as Frank Sinatra Jr., was an American jazz and big band singer, songwriter, and conductor.

He was the son of singer and actor Frank Sinatra and his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra, the younger brother of singer and actress Nancy Sinatra, and the older brother of television producer Tina Sinatra.

==Early life==

Francis Wayne Sinatra was born on January 10, 1944, in Jersey City, New Jersey, into the household of one of the most popular singers in the world, Frank Sinatra. The younger Sinatra was technically not a &quot;junior&quot;, as his father&#x27;s middle name was Albert, but was nonetheless known as Frank Jr. throughout his life. The younger Sinatra hardly saw his father, who was constantly on the road, either performing or working in films. Sinatra Jr. recalled wanting to become a pianist and songwriter from his earliest days.

===Kidnapping===
On December 8, 1963, Sinatra, 19 years old, was kidnapped from Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe (Room 417) and held for ransom. He was released two days later after his father paid the $240,000 ransom demanded by the kidnappers (). His father had offered $1 million (), but the kidnappers strangely declined the larger offer. In a later interview with Ira Glass, kidnapper Barry Keenan said that he initially intended to earn back the ransom over years and pay it back to Sinatra&#x27;s father. Keenan, Johnny Irwin, and Joe Amsler were soon captured, prosecuted for kidnapping, convicted, and sentenced to long prison terms, of which they served only small portions. Mastermind Keenan was later adjudged to have been legally insane at the time of the crime and hence not legally responsible for his actions. Famed attorney Gladys Root represented Irwin.

The kidnappers demanded that all communication be conducted by payphone. During these conversations, Sinatra&#x27;s father became concerned that he would not have enough coins, which prompted him to carry 10 dimes with him at all times for the rest of his life; he was even buried with 10 dimes in his pocket.

At the time of the kidnapping, Sinatra&#x27;s father and the Rat Pack were filming &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;. The stress of the kidnapping, in addition to the assassination of his close friend John F. Kennedy just a few weeks prior to the kidnapping, caused Sinatra&#x27;s father to seriously consider shutting down production, although the film was ultimately completed.

==Career==
By his early teens Sinatra had begun performing at local clubs. At the age of 19, he became the vocalist for Sam Donahue&#x27;s band. He also spent considerable time with Duke Ellington, learning the music business.

Sinatra spent most of his early career on the road. By 1968, he had performed in 47 states and 30 countries, had appeared as a guest on several television shows including two episodes of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; with his sister Nancy, hosted a 10-week summer replacement series for &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, had sung with his own band in Las Vegas casinos, and had been the opening act for bigger names at other casinos. During that time, he gained a reputation for rigorous rehearsals and demanding high standards for his musicians.

Sinatra appeared in the Sammy Davis Jr. drama &quot;A Man Called Adam&quot; in 1966. He also played a disturbed man who takes a stewardess hostage and later as officer Tom Boyd in three episodes of the television crime drama &quot;Adam-12&quot;, the last episode of which was titled &quot;Clinic on 18th Street&quot; (originally broadcast on March 13, 1974). This episode was an edited television pilot for a Mark VII Limited series that was not sold. His other acting credits included roles in &quot;Aru heishi no kake&quot; (1970) with Dale Robertson, &quot;Code Name Zebra&quot; (1987) opposite James Mitchum, and &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; (2003) with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett.

The United States National Archives now houses a 15-minute song and monologue composed by Sinatra in 1976, &quot;Over the Land&quot;. It evokes the memory of the U.S. flag and the nation&#x27;s experiences with the flag since the War of 1812.

Starting in 1988, at his father&#x27;s request, Sinatra placed his career on hold in order to act as his father&#x27;s musical director and conductor. Poet/vocalist Rod McKuen said:

In 1989, Sinatra sang &quot;Wedding Vows in Vegas&quot; on the Was (Not Was) album, &quot;What Up, Dog?&quot;, and performed the song live with the band on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on March 23, 1989.

During the 1997–1998 television season, Sinatra was offered the role of Vic Fontaine on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Despite being a fan of the show and finding the role interesting, he turned it down, declaring that he only wanted to play an alien. James Darren accepted the part, after refusing three times because he found the idea of a vocalist playing a vocalist to be too &quot;on the nose&quot;, but changed his mind when he read the script.

Sinatra guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;, in the episode &quot;You Only Come Once&quot; (2002), playing the villain Stink Finger, and he sang his own theme song for the character. He had a guest spot playing himself in an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot; (2000), in a role either mocking or acknowledging all the stories about his father&#x27;s involvement with the mob – he lets Paulie Walnuts refer to him as the &quot;Chairboy of the Board&quot;. 

Sinatra appeared in the show &quot;Family Guy&quot;, season 4, episode 19: &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot;, wherein he was introduced as the &quot;Member of the Board&quot;. He performed several tunes during the show, accompanied by Stewie and Brian. During the ending credits, he sang the &quot;Family Guy&quot; theme song. He also recorded a commentary for its DVD release.

He returned in a 2008 episode, &quot;Tales of a Third Grade Nothing&quot; (Season 7, Episode 6), wherein he sang with Brian again, with Stewie returning as a sideline investor supporting the duo. A third episode featuring Sinatra, &quot;Bookie of the Year&quot; (Season 15, Episode 2), aired posthumously on October 2, 2016, and was dedicated to his memory. This was his final screen appearance.

In 2006, Sinatra released the album &quot;That Face!&quot;, including the songs &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; and the self-penned song &quot;Spice&quot;.

Sinatra made a brief cameo appearance in the series premiere episode of the 2010 CBS legal comedy-drama &quot;The Defenders&quot;, as well as the show&#x27;s series finale.

On August 17, 2015, Sinatra sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Yankee Stadium. and sang the &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot; at the 2014 Belmont Stakes.

Sinatra appeared with Tierney Sutton on Patrick Williams’ 2015 CD &quot;Home Suite Home&quot;, performing &quot;I’ve Been Around.&quot; It is believed to be his last studio session. The recording earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. 

Sinatra&#x27;s song &quot;Black Night&quot;, written and sung by him, was used as the theme song to Rick Alverson&#x27;s feature film &quot;Entertainment&quot; (2015), starring Gregg Turkington and John C. Reilly.

==Personal life==

Sinatra married Cynthia McMurry on October 18, 1998. They divorced on January 7, 2000.

Sinatra underwent surgery for prostate cancer in January 2006.

On March 16, 2016, the Sinatra family released a statement to the Associated Press that Sinatra had died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest while on tour in Daytona Beach, Florida, at the age of 72. Only one illegitimate son of Sinatra was acknowledged in his obituary and otherwise, but three other children unacknowledged by him claimed his parentage.

==Critical reception==
Sinatra said that his famous name had opened some doors, but &quot;a famous father means that in order to prove yourself, you have to work three times harder than the guy off the street.&quot;

Music critic Richard Ginell wrote of a 2003 concert by Sinatra:

<text>The Human Environment Animal Protection Party (, short form: Animal Protection Party, ) is a political party in Germany, founded in 1993. In 2014, the party elected one MEP to the European Parliament, and it has remained at one MEP since. Between 2020 and 2024, the party was briefly unrepresented in the European Parliament due to the resignation of Martin Buschmann. The party has never had any members in any of the German state parliaments, nor has it ever had any members of the Bundestag.

== History ==
The Animal Protection Party first contested the 1993 Hamburg state election and received 0.3% of the vote. The party contested the 1994 federal election where it received 0.15% of the national vote (71,643 votes in total). It performed best in Bavaria, where it received 0.4% of the vote.

In the 1995 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, the party received 0.1% of the vote. In the 1996 Baden-Württemberg state election, the party received 0.3% of the vote. In 1997, the party elected its first ever official, with Jürgen Gerlach defeating a CDU candidate in the Aschbach local council elections. 

In the 1998 federal election, the party received 0.27% of the national vote (133,832 votes in total), almost doubling its votes. It did best in Brandenburg, where it received 0.9% of the vote.

In the 2021 federal election, the Animal Protection Party received 1.5% of the national vote (675,353 votes in total), which is the best result in a federal election since the party has been founded. 

The party took an anti-war position towards the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, arguing that neither NATO or EU should &quot;develop into a military global player&quot;, and condemning the militaristic and anti-Russian rhetoric. The party condemns the Russian invasion, but states that the European Union also bears responsibility for it. It supports a complete ban on arms exports to areas outside the EU, and argues that the EU should be forbidden from direct or indirect participation in foreign military actions, listing the wars in Middle East, Turkish conflict with Syrian and Iraqi Kurdish areas, as well as &quot;the heated up conflict in Kosovo and also to the war in Ukraine&quot; as examples. The Animal Protection Party also calls for dialogue with Russia and China, and believes that the Russian invasion should not lead to breakdown of diplomatic relations.

Sebastian Everding was elected for the party in the 2024 European Parliament election in Germany.

The party holds 37 seats in municipality and county assemblies and one seat in the Bezirkstag Oberbayern.

== Ideology, platform and policy ==
The Animal Protection Party is considered a left-wing political party, as part of the Animal Politics EU alliance. It is a member of The Left in the European Parliament, the furthest left group in the European Parliament. Its platform can be considered as left-liberal, environmentalist and pacifist.

The party aspires to turn away from the anthropocentric view of life. The party calls for an independent animal protection officer for each federal state. Its main goal is the introduction of more animal rights into the German constitution. Those include the right to live and the protection from physical and psychological damages. Thus, the Animal Protection Party demands prohibition of animal testing, bullfighting, hunting, the production of furs, circus animals and agricultural animal husbandry. Furthermore, the party supports the adaptation of Germans to veganism.

The Animal Protection Party wants a reduction of car traffic and an immediate exit from nuclear energy. The party calls for the “consistent use of renewable energies” and the phase-out of coal-fired power generation by 2030. Furthermore, the party also supports an EU-wide switch to 100% renewable energies by 2035. To strengthen climate protection, the party supports a ban on disposable electronic cigarettes, more consistent avoidance of plastic waste, including through fixed quotas for recyclable plastics.

Economically, the Animal Protection Party supports more social justice, a stamp duty and a free basic income. The Animal Protection Party supports equal rights for the LGBTQ community, and supports a euthanasia system similar to the Netherlands. On foreign policy, the party opposes a European army and backs a pacifism clause in the EU treaty.

<text>Fueled by Ramen, LLC (formerly Fueled by Ramen, Inc. until 2005) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group and distributed by 300 Elektra Entertainment. The label, founded in Gainesville, Florida, in 1996, is now based in New York City.

==History==
John Janick conceived of the label while attending high school, but it was not until he enrolled at the University of Florida in Gainesville and teamed up with Less Than Jake drummer-lyricist Vinnie Fiorello that Fueled By Ramen became a reality. The name of the label was inspired by only being able to afford a diet of inexpensive instant ramen at the time, due to having invested most of their money into making records.

Ramen&#x27;s first major success came in 1998 with the self-titled EP from Jimmy Eat World, which enabled the label to buy its first office space in Tampa.

Ramen early on partnered with the independent distribution arm of Warner, ADA; Warner&#x27;s Lyor Cohen finally made a deal for Ramen that led Janick to say &quot;We operate like an indie label that&#x27;s very small and nimble and can do their own thing, but we have the resources of a major company.&quot;

In 2004, Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Pete Wentz introduced Fueled By Ramen to fellow Chicago pop-rock outfit The Academy Is..., who released their debut album &quot;Almost Here&quot;, the following year. Soon thereafter, Janick joined forces with Wentz to create Decaydance Records and released a series of albums from a disparate-sounding group of acts ranging from the alternative hip hop of Gym Class Heroes to the indie-pop combo the Hush Sound. In September 2005, Decaydance and Fueled By Ramen released &quot;A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out&quot;, the RIAA quadruple-platinum-certified debut album from Las Vegas&#x27; Panic! at the Disco.

In 2006, Vinnie Fiorello left the label, citing disagreements in the direction of future signees and loss of passion in the music the label was investing itself in.

In 2007, the label opened an office in midtown Manhattan, and that same year Paramore&#x27;s album &quot;Riot!&quot; debuted in the top 20 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified gold and a year later gained platinum status. Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Pretty. Odd.&quot; achieved similar success, debuting at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, selling over 139,000 copies in its first week, and gaining platinum status. Later in 2016, Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Death of a Bachelor&quot; debuted at number 1, selling 196,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling album in the label&#x27;s history.

In 2012, Fueled By Ramen signed musical duo Twenty One Pilots. They released their label debut album &quot;Vessel&quot; in 2013, which included &quot;Ode to Sleep&quot;, &quot;Holding on to You&quot;, &quot;House of Gold&quot;, and &quot;Car Radio&quot;. In 2015, they released their breakthrough studio album &quot;Blurryface&quot;, which included &quot;Tear in My Heart&quot;, &quot;Fairly Local&quot;, &quot;Stressed Out&quot;, &quot;Heavydirtysoul&quot; and &quot;Ride&quot;. The album peaked at number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 charts, and was certified sextuple platinum after selling over 6 million copies in the U.S. alone. &quot;Stressed Out&quot; is the most viewed music video on Fueled by Ramen&#x27;s YouTube channel, accumulating over 2.9 billion views as of July 17, 2024.

In June 2018, Warner Music Group announced that Fueled by Ramen, amongst other labels, would be included in a new parent label, Elektra Music Group. It officially launched on October 1, 2018. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group, and subsequently Fueled by Ramen, was merged into the new umbrella label group 300 Elektra Entertainment.

Twelve albums released by Fueled By Ramen have been certified Platinum (some multiple times) by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of one million units or more:

<text>Jagdpanzer (JgPz) is the name given in German to an armored, tracked tank destroyer, although it may also be used for other kinds of self-propelled guns. Translated from German, &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; meaning &quot;hunting tank&quot;.

It typically refers to anti-tank variants of existing tank chassis with a well-armored casemate superstructure that mount an anti-tank gun with limited traverse in the front. These vehicles were classified by the western Allies of World War II as a tank destroyer.

==History==
The &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; designs followed on from the more lightly armored &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; (&quot;tank hunter&quot;) designs, which took an anti-tank gun and mounted it on top of a tank chassis with supplementary armor fitted around the gun crew. However, the armor typically had an open rear and top, almost never providing the crew with full protection from the elements. In addition, much experience was gained from the Sturmgeschütz series of assault guns for infantry support, which already used heavily armored casemates, completely enclosing the vehicle&#x27;s crew. Although they were associated with artillery and infantry support, they were often used in the anti-tank role.

==Tactical use==
On the battlefield when the Germans had to retreat, their line of retreat would preferably pass the location of their anti-tank units, who would use their superior firepower to stop the enemy, perhaps even open the possibility of a counter-attack. Due to the lack of a turret and the armor being concentrated at the front, the ideal combat situation for &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; units was in the planned ambush, and the skill of the commander of such units lay in correctly choosing and preparing such places long before needed.

==Types==
The list below comprises some of the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;-type tank destroyers made by Germany.
==Post-war usage==
After the war, the name &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; was kept in use in the Bundeswehr for a number of armored vehicles used for anti-tank duties. This included the &quot;Kanonenjagdpanzer&quot;, a casemate vehicle intended for infantry support&quot;.&quot; and the &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer&quot; series. The first &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer&quot; was the &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer 1&quot; built on the chassis of the &quot;SPz Lang&quot; HS.30 and armed with SS.11 missiles. The &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer 2&quot; was built on the same chassis as the &quot;Kanonenjagdpanzer&quot;, but was equipped with two SS.11 launch-rails instead of carrying a gun.

Later, the &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer&quot; 2 and the &quot;Kanonenjagdpanzer&quot; were upgraded to Jaguar 1 and Jaguar 2 tank destroyers, armed with HOT or TOW missiles.

<text>Andingmen () was a gate in Beijing&#x27;s Ming-era city wall. The gate was torn down along with the city wall in the 1960s. Andingmen is now a place name. Where the gate once stood is now Andingmen Bridge, a roundabout overpass on the northern 2nd Ring Road. The overpass links Andingmen Inner Street which runs south of the overpass inside the walled city and Andingmen Outer Street which runs north away from the wall of the city. 

Bus and trolleybus stops are nearby, along with Andingmen Station, Line 2 of the Beijing Subway.

Ju&#x27;er Hutong () is a popular neighborhood for expats to live in. It is located in the hutongs southwest of Jiaodaokou, and just east of Shichahai and Gulou (the Drum Tower). Yongkang Hutong () is another popular residential location for expats in Beijing.

<text>Rodenticides are chemicals made and sold for the purpose of killing rodents. While commonly referred to as &quot;rat poison&quot;, rodenticides are also used to kill mice, woodchucks, chipmunks, porcupines, nutria, beavers, and voles.

Some rodenticides are lethal after one exposure while others require more than one. Rodents are disinclined to gorge on an unknown food (perhaps reflecting an adaptation to their inability to vomit), preferring to sample, wait and observe whether it makes them or other rats sick. This phenomenon of poison shyness is the rationale for poisons that kill only after multiple doses.

Besides being directly toxic to the mammals that ingest them, including dogs, cats, and humans, many rodenticides present a secondary poisoning risk to animals that hunt or scavenge the dead corpses of rats.

==Classes of rodenticides==
=== Anticoagulants ===

Anticoagulants are defined as chronic (death occurs one to two weeks after ingestion of the lethal dose, rarely sooner), single-dose (second generation) or multiple-dose (first generation) rodenticides, acting by effective blocking of the vitamin-K cycle, resulting in inability to produce essential blood-clotting factors—mainly coagulation factors II (prothrombin) and VII (proconvertin).

In addition to this specific metabolic disruption, massive toxic doses of 4-hydroxycoumarin, 4-thiochromenone and 1,3-indandione anticoagulants cause damage to tiny blood vessels (capillaries), increasing their permeability, causing internal bleeding. These effects are gradual, developing over several days. In the final phase of the intoxication, the exhausted rodent collapses due to hemorrhagic shock or severe anemia and dies. The question of whether the use of these rodenticides can be considered humane has been raised.

The main benefit of anticoagulants over other poisons is that the time taken for the poison to induce death means that the rats do not associate the damage with their feeding habits.

* First-generation rodenticidal anticoagulants generally have shorter elimination half-lives, require higher concentrations (usually between 0.005% and 0.1%) and consecutive intake over days in order to accumulate the lethal dose, and are less toxic than second-generation agents.
* Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (or SGARs) are far more toxic than those of the first generation. They are generally applied in lower concentrations in baits—usually on the order of 0.001% to 0.005%—are lethal after a single ingestion of bait and are also effective against strains of rodents that became resistant to first-generation anticoagulants; thus, the second-generation anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as &quot;superwarfarins&quot;.

Phylloquinone has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for pets or humans accidentally or intentionally exposed to anticoagulant poisons. Some of these poisons act by inhibiting liver functions and in advanced stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors are absent, and the volume of circulating blood is diminished, so that a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who has been poisoned, an advantage over some older poisons. A unique enzyme produced by the liver enables the body to recycle vitamin K. To produce the blood clotting factors that prevent excessive bleeding, the body needs vitamin K. Anticoagulants hinder this enzyme&#x27;s ability to function. Internal bleeding could start if the body&#x27;s reserve of anticoagulant runs out from exposure to enough of it. Because they bind more closely to the enzyme that produces blood clotting agents, single-dose anticoagulants are more hazardous. They may also obstruct several stages of the recycling of vitamin K. Single-dose or second-generation anticoagulants can be stored in the liver because they are not quickly eliminated from the body.

=== Metal phosphides ===

Metal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1–3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually zinc phosphide) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2–4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).

Zinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in a concentration of 0.75% to 2.0%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor due to the phosphine liberated by hydrolysis. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repel) rodents, but has a repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds, notably wild turkeys, are not sensitive to the smell, and might feed on the bait, and thus fall victim to the poison.

The tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phosphide for fumigation/gassing) may also contain other chemicals which evolve ammonia, which helps reduce the potential for spontaneous combustion or explosion of the phosphine gas.

Metal phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, so the risk of secondary poisoning is low.

Before the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of shortage of strychnine due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the strychnine tree is grown. Phosphides are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings.

Phosphides used as rodenticides include:
* aluminium phosphide (fumigant and bait)
* calcium phosphide (fumigant only)
* magnesium phosphide (fumigant only)
* zinc phosphide (bait only)

=== Hypercalcemia (vitamin D overdose)===
Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) are used as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis D. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO3]+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and action potential propagation between the atria and ventricles), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol (30,000 IU/g) and 0.1% ergocalciferol (40,000 IU/g) when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat.

There is an important feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicant. In other words, mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect can be achieved by a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait, and vice versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants.

The first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today&#x27;s Sorexa D), back in the early 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.

The Merck Veterinary Manual states the following:

Although this rodenticide [cholecalciferol] was introduced with claims that it was less toxic to nontarget species than to rodents, clinical experience has shown that rodenticides containing cholecalciferol are a significant health threat to dogs and cats. Cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to kidney failure, cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18-36 hours of ingestion and can include depression, anorexia, polyuria and polydipsia. As serum calcium concentrations increase, clinical signs become more severe. ... GI smooth muscle excitability decreases and is manifest by anorexia, vomiting and constipation. ... Loss of renal concentrating ability is a direct result of hypercalcemia. As hypercalcemia persists, mineralization of the kidneys results in progressive renal insufficiency.&quot;

Additional anticoagulant renders the bait more toxic to pets as well as humans. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants. Treatment in pets is mostly supportive, with intravenous fluids and pamidronate disodium. The hormone calcitonin is no longer commonly used.

=== Other ===

Other chemical poisons include:
*ANTU (α-naphthylthiourea; specific against Brown rat, &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;)
*Arsenic trioxide
*Barium carbonate (sometimes called Witherite)
*Chloralose (a narcotic prodrug)
*Crimidine (inhibits metabolism of vitamin B6)
*1,3-Difluoro-2-propanol (&quot;Gliftor&quot;)
*Endrin (organochlorine insecticide, used in the past for extermination of voles in fields)
*Fluoroacetamide (&quot;1081&quot;)
*Phosacetim (a delayed-action acetylcholinesterase inhibitor)
*Phosphorus allotropes
*Pyrinuron (a urea derivative)
*Scilliroside and other cardiac glycosides like oleandrin or digoxin
*Sodium fluoroacetate (&quot;1080&quot;)
*Strychnine (A naturally occurring convulsant and stimulant)
*Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (&quot;tetramine&quot;) - Deadly toxic to humans so use should be avoided
*Thallium sulfate
*Mitochondrial toxins like bromethalin and 2,4-dinitrophenol (cause high fever and brain swelling)
*Zyklon B/Uragan D2 (hydrogen cyanide gas absorbed in an inert carrier)

===Combinations===
In some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., anticoagulant + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to other rodenticides are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.

==Low-toxicity/Eco-friendly rodenticides==
Powdered corn cob and corn meal gluten have been developed as rodenticides. They were approved in the EU and patented in the US in 2013. These preparations rely on dehydration and electrolyte imbalance to cause death.

Inert gas killing of burrowing pest animals is another method with no impact on scavenging wildlife. One such method has been commercialized and sold under the brand name Rat Ice.

==Non-target issues==

===Secondary poisoning and risks to wildlife===

One of the potential problems when using rodenticides is that dead or weakened rodents may be eaten by other wildlife, either predators or scavengers. Members of the public deploying rodenticides may not be aware of this or may not follow the product&#x27;s instructions closely enough. There is evidence of secondary poisoning being caused by exposure to prey. 

The faster a rodenticide acts, the more critical this problem may be. For the fast-acting rodenticide bromethalin, for example, there is no diagnostic test or antidote.

This has led environmental researchers to conclude that low strength, long duration rodenticides (generally first generation anticoagulants) are the best balance between maximum effect and minimum risk.

===Proposed US legislation change===

In 2008, after assessing human health and ecological effects, as well as benefits, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced measures to reduce risks associated with ten rodenticides. New restrictions by sale and distribution restrictions, minimum package size requirements, use site restriction, and tamper resistant products would have taken effect in 2011. The regulations were delayed pending a legal challenge by manufacturer Reckitt-Benkiser.

==Notable rat eradications==
The entire rat populations of several islands have been eradicated, most notably New Zealand&#x27;s Campbell Island, Hawadax Island, Alaska (formerly known as Rat Island), Macquarie Island and Canna, Scotland (declared rat-free in 2008). According to the Friends of South Georgia Island, all of the rats have been eliminated from South Georgia.

Alberta, Canada, through a combination of climate and control, is also believed to be rat-free.

<text>Mark Lemon (30 November 1809, in London – 23 May 1870, in Crawley) was the founding editor of both &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Field&quot;. He was also a writer of plays and verses.

==Biography==

Lemon was born in Marylebone, Westminster, Middlesex, on 30 November 1809. He was the son of Martin Lemon, a hop merchant, and Alice Collis. His parents married on 26 December 1808 at St Mary, Marylebone, Westminster. His father died in Hendon in 1818, and between 1817 and 1823 Lemon lived at Church Farmhouse, where a blue plaque commemorates him. 

Lemon was educated at Cheam School, then in Surrey. This was then strictly for the sons of gentlemen only, and a boy had to leave when his father was found to be a tradesman, with a shop in London selling cutlery. It seems that the family background of young Lemon was not discovered.

At the age of 15, Lemon was sent to live in Boston, Lincolnshire, with his mother&#x27;s brother Thomas Collis.

Lemon had a natural talent for journalism and the stage, and at 26 retired from less congenial business to devote himself to the writing of plays. More than sixty of his melodramas, operettas and comedies were produced in London, whilst at the same time he was contributing to a wide variety of magazines and newspapers.

He married Helen (Nelly) Romer, on 28 September 1839 in Kensington, London and had eight children – sons Mark, Frank and Henry, and daughters Alice, Betty, Helen, Mary and Kate. Frank died shortly after he was born. Betty married Sir Robert Romer and their son was Mark Lemon Romer.

In 1841 Lemon and Henry Mayhew conceived the idea of a humorous weekly paper to be called &quot;Punch&quot;, and when the first number was issued, in July 1841, were joint editors and with the printer and engraver equal owners. The paper was for some time unsuccessful, Lemon keeping it alive out of the profits of his plays. On the sale of &quot;Punch&quot;, Lemon became sole editor for the new proprietors. It remained under his control until his death, achieving remarkable popularity and influence.

Two other long-running magazines in which Lemon played a significant part were the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, the first publication to make use of pictures as well as text in reporting, which was founded by his friend Herbert Ingram, and &quot;The Field&quot;, of which he was founder editor (1853–57).
Lemon was an actor of ability, a pleasing lecturer and a successful impersonator of Shakespearian characters. He played in the 1851 production of &quot;Not So Bad As We Seem&quot;, a play written by Edward Bulwer featuring many notable Victorians, including Charles Dickens. He also wrote novelettes and lyrics, over a hundred songs, a few three-volume novels, several Christmas fairy tales and a volume of jests. He was a stalwart of the London gentlemen&#x27;s Savage Club.

Lemon died in his adopted home town Crawley, West Sussex on 23 May 1870 and was buried in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Ifield. A blue plaque commemorates him outside The George Hotel, Crawley.

His daughter, Mary Mark-Lemon, was a successful songwriter, noted for &quot;Daddy&quot;, with music by Arthur Henry Behrend.

<text>Charlotte of France (23 October 1516 – 18 September 1524) was the second child and second daughter of the French King Francis I and his wife Queen Claude.

==Early life==
Princess Charlotte was born on 23 October 1516 at the Château d&#x27;Amboise (in the Loire Valley in France) as the second daughter and child of King Francis I and Queen Claude. She had greenish blue eyes and bright red hair. She was one of the six children of the King and Queen that had red hair, a trait inherited from Anne of Brittany, the Queen&#x27;s mother.

Following the death of her older sister Louise in 1518, Charlotte took her place as the fiancée of King Charles I of Spain (the later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V) under the Treaty of Noyon. The marriage would never be completed due to her early death.

==Later life and death==
She lived a happy life. Before March 1519 she moved from the Château d&#x27;Amboise to the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she remained for the rest of her short life. She had always been a delicate, frail child. At age seven, she contracted measles, the same disease which had killed her uncle, Charles Orlando, Dauphin of France, thirty years earlier. The only person who looked after her while she was sick was her aunt, Margaret of Angoulême, as her mother had already died two months earlier, her grandmother Louise of Savoy was very sick and her father was occupied by war. As he was later imprisoned, he was absent when his daughter died on 18 September 1524. Charlotte likely was very close to her aunt, who was heartbroken and distraught when her &quot;little one&quot; died.

<text>The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) is an echelon IV component of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NMOC), which provides worldwide meteorological and oceanographic data and analysis for the United States Navy and strategic allies of the United States. The center is based out of Monterey, California. FNMOC provides Global and Regional Weather Prediction Charts (WXMAP) and Global Ensemble Weather Prediction Charts (EFS). WxMAP depictions of NAVGEM predictions for side-by-side comparison with NCEP global NWS models (GFS) are also available. FNMOC provides Global and Regional Ocean Wave Prediction Charts (WW3), Global Ensemble Ocean Wave Prediction Charts (WW3 Ensemble), and Global Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Anomaly Charts (NCODA). FNMOC provides links to satellite imagery of tropical cyclones (TCWEB) and current tropical storm forecast tracks.

FNMOC is composed of military and civilian personnel. The team consists of specialists in meteorology, oceanography, computer science, and Fleet operations. The team&#x27;s efforts provide computerized weather and ocean prediction products, weather satellite imagery products, and related tactical decision aids and data, supporting virtually every combat platform and weapons system operated by the US Navy.

== History ==
In 1958, the Navy Numerical Weather Problems (NANWEP) group was established in Suitland, Maryland. NANWEP was later moved to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in 1959. Fleet Numerical Weather Facility was established in 1961. In 1974, Fleet Numerical Weather Facility moved from NPS to its standalone location in Monterey, California. In 1993, the operating title: Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), was adopted. In 2005, Fleet Numerical was realigned under Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NMOC). In 2011, Fleet Numerical completed a new Computer Operations Center.

FNMOC is one of the US Department of Defense&#x27;s (DOD) primary central production sites for worldwide computer-generated operational meteorological and oceanographic analysis and forecast products.

== Organization ==
FNMOC is an echelon IV command aligned under the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (COMNAVMETOCCOM) or CNMOC. FNMOC is co-located with Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Marine Meteorology Division. FNMOC maintains close ties with the nearby Naval Postgraduate School.

== Numerical Weather Prediction==
Central to FNMOC modeling capability is a global numerical weather model called the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) and a global ocean prediction model called the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). FNMOC models a variety of global, regional, sub-regional areas and specialized ocean and atmospheric environments as the DOD&#x27;s premier Numerical Weather Prediction Center.

<doc id="991192" wikidata="Q409224" url="?curid=991192" title="Barium carbonate">
<text>Barium carbonate is the inorganic compound with the formula BaCO3. Like most alkaline earth metal carbonates, it is a white salt that is poorly soluble in water. It occurs as the mineral known as witherite. In a commercial sense, it is one of the most important barium compounds.

==Preparation==
Barium carbonate is made commercially from barium sulfide by treatment with sodium carbonate at 60 to 70 °C (soda ash method) or, more commonly carbon dioxide at 40 to 90 °C:

In the soda ash process, an aqueous solution of barium sulfide is treated with sodium carbonate:

==Reactions==
Barium carbonate reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to form soluble barium salts, such as barium chloride:

Pyrolysis of barium carbonate gives barium oxide.

==Uses==
It is mainly used to remove sulfate impurities from feedstock of the chlor-alkali process. Otherwise it is a common precursor to barium-containing compounds such as ferrites.

===Other uses===
Barium carbonate is widely used in the ceramics industry as an ingredient in glazes. It acts as a flux, a matting and crystallizing agent and combines with certain colouring oxides to produce unique colours not easily attainable by other means. Its use is somewhat controversial since it can leach from glazes into food and drink. To reduce toxicity concerns, it is often substituted with strontium carbonate, which behaves in a similar way in glazes but is of lower toxicity.

In the brick, tile, earthenware and pottery industries barium carbonate is added to clays to precipitate soluble salts (calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) that cause efflorescence.

It is sometimes used as an &quot;energiser&quot; in the Case-hardening process.

<text>Jules Auguste Lemire (April 23, 1853 – March 7, 1928), French priest and social reformer, was born at Vieux-Berquin (Nord).

==Life==
He was educated at the college of St Francis of Assisi, Hazebrouck, where he subsequently taught philosophy and rhetoric. In 1897 he was elected deputy for Hazebrouck and was returned unopposed at the elections of 1898, 1902 and 1906.

He organized a society called &quot;La Ligue française du coin de terre et du foyer&quot;, the object of which was to secure, at the expense of the state, a piece of land for every French family desirous of possessing one. The abbé Lemire sat in the chamber of deputies as a conservative republican and Christian Socialist.

He protested in 1893 against the action of the Dupuy cabinet in closing the Bourses du Travail, characterizing it as the expression of a policy of disdain of the workers. In December 1893 he was seriously injured by the bomb thrown by the anarchist Vaillant from the gallery of the chamber.

<doc id="991201" wikidata="Q269953" url="?curid=991201" title="Michelle of Valois">
<text>Michelle of France (11 January 1395 – 8 July 1422), also called Michelle of Valois, was Duchess consort of Burgundy as the first wife of Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, called &quot;Philip the Good&quot;. She was born a princess of France as the daughter of Charles VI, King of France and Isabeau of Bavaria.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Michelle of France was born on 11 January 1395 as the seventh child and fifth daughter of Charles VI, King of France (1368–1422) and his wife, born Isabeau/Isabelle of Bavaria (–1435). Three of her elder siblings had already died by the time of her birth, however, she had five younger siblings, four of whom survived infancy. She was named for Saint Michael the Archangel after her father noted an improvement in his health after a pilgrimage to Mont Saint-Michel in 1393. The children of the royal family were raised with great care. Their mother purchased luxurious toys, clothes and gifts for them, and regularly corresponded with them when they were apart. During pandemics, she ensured they were sent to safety in the countryside.

=== Marriage ===
In June 1409, at the age of 14, Michelle married 13-year-old Philip, Count of Charolais (1396–1467), son and heir of John I, Duke of Burgundy (&quot;John the Fearless&quot;, 1371–1419). They had probably been engaged on 28 January 1405, at the age of 9 and 8, respectively. Michelle and Philip were second cousins, both descending from John II, King of France (&quot;John the Good&quot;). At the same time, Michelle&#x27;s eldest brother, Louis, Dauphin of Viennois (1397–1415) married Philip&#x27;s eldest sister Margaret (1393–1442). Michelle and Philip had a daughter, Agnes, who died in infancy.

On 10 September 1419, Michelle&#x27;s father-in-law John the Fearless was assassinated, with involvement from her brother, Charles (1403–1461), the new dauphin as a part of the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. The civil war was fought for power during the mental instability of King Charles VI (Michelle&#x27;s father). It is possible that John had been behind the deaths of Michelle&#x27;s two brothers, Louis (1397–1415) and John (1398–1417). It has also been suggested that the Armagnac party wanted John dead to prevent a likely rapprochement between him and the dauphin, which could have diminished their influence. Michelle became melancholic (what we would today call extremely depressed) following the assassination.

=== Death ===
In 1422, while her husband was away preparing for the battle of Cone, Michelle fell ill and died on 8 July in Ghent. All of the inhabitants grieved, as she had been much loved by the people. She was buried in Saint Bavo&#x27;s Abbey near the city. In 1540, the abbey was destroyed on the orders of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, causing only a fragment of her tomb to remain to this day. After her death, rumors circulated that she had been poisoned by a former attendant, known as &quot;Dame de Viesville&quot;, a close confidante dismissed shortly before Michelle&#x27;s death. However, no charges were ever brought up against her.

Her widower married two more times, first two years after her death to Bonne of Artois (1396–1425). He had three children from his third marriage, and at least 18 illegitimate children from a total of 24 documented mistresses, two of whom were certainly born during his marriage to Michelle.

<text>David Oyetokunbo Oyelowo ( ; ; born 1 April 1976) is a British actor, director and producer. His accolades include a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and two NAACP Image Awards as well as nominations for three Golden Globe Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award. In 2016, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to drama.

Oyelowo rose to prominence for portraying Martin Luther King Jr. in the biographical drama film &quot;Selma&quot; (2014) and Peter Snowden in the HBO film &quot;Nightingale&quot; (2014), both of which garnered him critical acclaim. He also achieved praise for his roles as Louis Gaines in &quot;The Butler&quot; (2013), Seretse Khama in &quot;A United Kingdom&quot; (2016) and Robert Katende in &quot;Queen of Katwe&quot; (2016). He has also played supporting roles in the films &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2011), &quot;The Help&quot; (2011), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), &quot;Red Tails&quot; (2012), and &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (2012).

On television, Oyelowo has played MI5 officer Danny Hunter in the British drama series &quot;Spooks&quot; (2002–2004) and Javert in the BBC miniseries &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2018). He also provided the voice for Agent Alexsandr Kallus in the Lucasfilm Animation series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2014–2018) and Holston Becker in the Apple+ drama series Silo. He stars in and co-produces the 2023 Paramount+ western series &quot;&quot;.

== Early life ==
Oyelowo was born on 1 April 1976 in Oxford, Oxfordshire, to Nigerian parents. His father, Stephen, is from Oyo State, South West Nigeria, while his mother is Igbo from South East Nigeria. He was brought up as a Baptist. He grew up on an estate in Tooting Bec, South London, until he was six, when his family moved to Lagos, Nigeria, where his father worked for the national airline and his mother worked for a railway company. Oyelowo grew up idolizing Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington. Oyelowo attended a &quot;military-style&quot; boarding-school named Lagos State Model College, Meiran. His family returned to London when Oyelowo was 14, settling in Islington. Oyelowo is an &quot;omoba&quot; (or prince) of the Yoruba people in the Nigerian chieftaincy system, his grandfather having been king of &quot;a part of Oyo State called Awe&quot;. He has commented of his background: &quot;It sounds way more impressive than it actually is. There are so many royal families in Africa&quot;, &quot;royal families are a dime a dozen in Nigeria&quot;; &quot;what we think of as royalty in the UK is very different to royalty in Nigeria: if you were to throw a stone there, you would hit about 30 princes. So, it&#x27;s a bit more like being the Prince of Islington: it was useful for getting dates but probably not much else&quot;.

While enrolled in theatre studies at City and Islington College, his teacher suggested that he become an actor. Oyelowo enrolled for a year in an acting foundation course, at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He finished his three-year training in 1998. He also spent time with the National Youth Theatre.

==Career==

===Stage===
He began his stage career in 1999 when he was offered a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company playing roles in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;, as the title character in &quot;Oroonoko&quot; (which he also performed in the BBC radio adaptation) and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1999) alongside Guy Henry, Frances de la Tour and Alan Bates. However, he is best known for his next stage performance as King Henry VI in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 2001 productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s trilogy of plays about the king as a part of its season &quot;This England: The Histories&quot;. In a major landmark for colour-blind casting, Oyelowo was the first black actor to play an English king in a major production of Shakespeare, and although this casting choice was initially criticised by some in the media, Oyelowo&#x27;s performance was critically acclaimed and later won the 2001 Ian Charleson Award for best performance by an actor under 30 in a classical play.

In 2005, he appeared in a production of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which was revived in New York City in 2007. In 2006, he made his directorial debut on a production of &quot;The White Devil&quot;, produced by Inservice, his theatre company in Brighton which is co-run with fellow Brighton-based actors Priyanga Burford, Israel Aduramo, Penelope Cobbuld, and his wife, Jessica. He played the title role in &quot;Othello&quot; in 2016 at the New York Theatre Workshop with Daniel Craig as Iago, directed by Sam Gold. In 2024, he starred in the Royal National Theater production of Coriolanus.

===Television===
Oyelowo is best known for playing MI5 officer Danny Hunter in the British drama series &quot;Spooks&quot; (known in North America as &quot;MI-5&quot;) from 2002 to 2004. He had before that appeared in &quot;Tomorrow La Scala&quot; (2002), &quot;Maisie Raine&quot; (1998) and &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; (1998). Soon after the end of his time on &quot;Spooks&quot; Oyelowo also appeared in the two Christmas specials of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (2005). In 2006, he appeared in the television film &quot;Born Equal&quot; alongside Nikki Amuka-Bird as a couple fleeing persecution in Nigeria – they also both appeared in &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot; (2006) and in &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot; (2008) as a husband and wife. Other cameos have included &quot;Mayo&quot; (guest-starring on 30 April 2006) and the television film &quot;Sweet Nothing in My Ear&quot; (2008, as defence attorney Leonard Grisham), while he has played recurring or main characters in &quot;Five Days&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Passion&quot; (2008, as Joseph of Arimathea).

In December 2009, he played the leading role of Gilbert in the BBC TV adaptation of Andrea Levy&#x27;s novel &quot;Small Island&quot;. In March 2010, he played the role of Keme Tobodo in the BBC&#x27;s drama series &quot;Blood and Oil&quot;. He starred in the HBO original film &quot;Nightingale&quot; (2014). He stars in and co-produces the 2023 American western series , based on the life of former slave Bass Reeves who, after the American Civil War, became one of the first Black deputy U.S. Marshals, and the first west of the Mississippi River.

===Voice acting===
He appeared as Olaudah Equiano in &quot;Grace Unshackled – The Olaudah Equiano Story&quot;, a radio play adapting Equiano&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot;. This was first broadcast on BBC 7 on 8 April 2007, with his wife Jessica Oyelowo as Mrs. Equiano.

In 2007, Oyelowo was the reader for John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Mission Song&quot;. &quot;AudioFile&quot; magazine stated: &quot;Think of David Oyelowo as a single musician playing all the instruments in a symphony. That is essentially what he manages in this inspired performance of John le Carré&#x27;s suspense novel... Can it really have been only one man in the narrator&#x27;s recording booth? This virtuoso performance makes that seem impossible.&quot; In 2015, he was selected to portray James Bond in an audiobook version of &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot;, written by Anthony Horowitz.

, he provides the voice of Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus on the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. , Oyelowo voices the spirit of Scar, the main antagonist in season 2 of &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;. Oyelowo voiced the Tiger in a television adaptation of &quot;The Tiger Who Came to Tea&quot; which aired on Channel 4 for Christmas 2019.

===Film===

In 2012, Oyelowo appeared in &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. Writer-director Ava DuVernay had been a fan of his work and had considered asking him to take the role, however before she could, Oyelowo received the script coincidentally from a friend of a friend of DuVernay&#x27;s who happened to be sitting next to him on the plane and was considering investing in the project. The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival to critical raves. That same year Oyelowo appeared in Lee Daniels&#x27; &quot;The Paperboy&quot;, which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. Oyelowo reunited with Daniels the following year in &quot;The Butler&quot;.

In 2014, Oyelowo formed his own independent production company, Yoruba Saxon Productions which has co-produced movies that featured him including, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Captive&quot;, &quot;Five Nights in Maine&quot; and most recently, &quot;A United Kingdom&quot;.

He worked with DuVernay again for &quot;Selma&quot; (2014), playing civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. The film, based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, had originally been set to be directed by Lee Daniels, but the project was dropped by Daniels so he could focus on &quot;The Butler&quot;.

He was slated to star with Lupita Nyong&#x27;o in a film adaptation of the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie novel &quot;Americanah&quot; but scheduling conflicts meant the project never moved forward.

In February 2019, it was announced that Oyelowo had joined the &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; cast with James Corden, Rose Byrne and Domhnall Gleeson reprising their roles as the title character, Bea and Thomas McGregor for its sequel due to be released in March 2021.

In 2020, Oyelowo starred alongside George Clooney in the Netflix film &quot;The Midnight Sky&quot;. More recently, his Yoruba Saxon company signed a first look deal with Disney. The first film to come out of the deal will be &quot;The Return of the Rocketeer&quot;, a Disney+-exclusive sequel to the 1991 film &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, which Oyelowo will produce alongside his wife, Jessica, and Brigham Taylor. Oyelowo is also being considered to star in the film, which will center on &quot;a retired Tuskegee airman who takes up the Rocketeer mantle&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
For his portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. in &quot;Selma&quot;, Oyelowo received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture. He received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama, while also receiving a nomination for Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actor.

Also in 2014, for his performance in &quot;Nightingale&quot;, he won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Movie/Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special and a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.

Oyelowo was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to drama.

In 2024, Oyewolo was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film for his performance in as Bass Reeves.

==Personal life==
He is married to actress Jessica Oyelowo, whom he met at LAMDA and with whom he has four children. They lived in Brighton before moving to Los Angeles, California. Oyelowo is a pescetarian. 

A devout Christian, Oyelowo has stated that he believes God called him to play Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Reflecting on his portrayal of King in the film &quot;Selma&quot;, Oyelowo has asserted: &quot;I always knew that in order to play Dr. King, I had to have God flow through me because when you see Dr. King giving those speeches, you see that he is moving in his anointing.&quot;

A dual citizen, Oyelowo and his wife became naturalized US citizens on 20 July 2016. On doing so, he stated: &quot;I did a film called &quot;Selma&quot;... and that film centres on voting rights and I&#x27;ve lived here for nearly 10 years now and to be walking around and doing a film about voting rights and telling people to vote, and you can&#x27;t vote yourself is a little hypocritical. I decided it&#x27;s time to do it and no time better than now.&quot;

He expressed solidarity with Palestine during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Oyelowo, as part of a group called Artists4Ceasefire, signed a letter urging US President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

<text>Alendronic acid, sold under the brand name Fosamax among others, is a bisphosphonate medication used to treat osteoporosis and Paget&#x27;s disease of bone. It is taken by mouth. Use is often recommended together with vitamin D, calcium supplementation, and lifestyle changes.
Common side effects (1 to 10% of patients) include constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, and acid reflux. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or in those with poor kidney function. Alendronic acid works by decreasing the activity of cells that break down bone.
Alendronic acid was first described in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 103rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Alendronic acid is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis; the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; and the treatment of Paget&#x27;s disease of bone.

==Side effects==
* Gastrointestinal tract:
**Ulceration and possible rupture of the esophagus; this may require hospitalization and intensive treatment. Gastric and duodenal ulceration may also occur.
** Esophageal cancer, a meta-analysis concluded that bisphosphonate treatment is NOT associated with excess risk of esophageal cancer.
* General: infrequent cases of skin rash, rarely manifesting as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, eye problems (uveitis, scleritis) and generalized muscle, joint, and bone pain (rarely severe) have been reported.
* Osteonecrosis of the jaw may occur while on this drug, if dental work of any kind is carried out. The risk is considerably higher for extractions in the mandible (lower jaw) than other areas of the mouth, and the risk increases if you have been taking it for four or more years Although this side effect is uncommon (0.4-1.6% for oral alendronic acid), it occurs primarily in patients being administered intravenous bisphosphonates, with most cases being reported in cancer patients.
* Bone: alendronate has been linked in long-term users to the development of low-impact femoral fractures. Further, studies suggest that users of alendronate have an increase in the numbers of osteoclasts and develop giant, more multinucleated osteoclasts; the significance of this development is unclear. Fosamax has been linked to a rare type of leg fracture that cuts straight across the upper thigh bone after little or no trauma (subtrochanteric fractures).

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, which include ibandronate, pamidronate and alendronate exert their effects on osteoclasts mainly by inhibiting the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via the mevalonate pathway. These isoprenoids are used in posttranslational modifcation(prenylation) of small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac. These prenylated GTPases are necessary for various cellular processes including osteoclast morphology, endosome trafficking, and apoptosis. Alendronate has also been shown to impair the function of osteclast lysosomes.
===Pharmacokinetics===
The fraction of the drug that reaches the circulatory system intact (systemic bioavailability) after oral dosing is low, averaging only 0.6–0.7% in women and in men under fasting conditions. Intake together with meals and beverages other than water further reduces the bioavailability. The absorbed drug rapidly partitions, with approximately 50% binding to the exposed bone surface; the remainder is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Unlike with most drugs, the strong negative charge on the two phosphonate moieties limits oral bioavailability, and, in turn, the exposure to tissues other than bone is very low. After absorption in the bone, alendronate has an estimated terminal elimination half-life of 10 years.

<text>A divisibility rule is a shorthand and useful way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits. Although there are divisibility tests for numbers in any radix, or base, and they are all different, this article presents rules and examples only for decimal, or base 10, numbers. Martin Gardner explained and popularized these rules in his September 1962 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

== Divisibility rules for numbers 1−30 ==
The rules given below transform a given number into a generally smaller number, while preserving divisibility by the divisor of interest. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the resulting number should be evaluated for divisibility by the same divisor. In some cases the process can be iterated until the divisibility is obvious; for others (such as examining the last &quot;n&quot; digits) the result must be examined by other means.

For divisors with multiple rules, the rules are generally ordered first for those appropriate for numbers with many digits, then those useful for numbers with fewer digits.

To test the divisibility of a number by a power of 2 or a power of 5 (2&quot;n&quot; or 5&quot;n&quot;, in which &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer), one only need to look at the last &quot;n&quot; digits of that number.

To test divisibility by any number expressed as the product of prime factors formula_1, we can separately test for divisibility by each prime to its appropriate power. For example, testing divisibility by 24 is equivalent to testing divisibility by 8 (23) and 3 simultaneously, thus we need only show divisibility by 8 and by 3 to prove divisibility by 24.

==Step-by-step examples==

===Divisibility by 2===
First, take any number (for this example it will be 376) and note the last digit in the number, discarding the other digits. Then take that digit (6) while ignoring the rest of the number and determine if it is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then the original number is divisible by 2.

Example
# 376 (The original number)
# 37 6 (Take the last digit)
# 6 ÷ 2 = 3 (Check to see if the last digit is divisible by 2)
# 376 ÷ 2 = 188 (If the last digit is divisible by 2, then the whole number is divisible by 2)

===Divisibility by 3 or 9===
First, take any number (for this example it will be 492) and add together each digit in the number (4 + 9 + 2 = 15). Then take that sum (15) and determine if it is divisible by 3. The original number is divisible by 3 (or 9) if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 (or 9).

Adding the digits of a number up, and then repeating the process with the result until only one digit remains, will give the remainder of the original number if it were divided by nine (unless that single digit is nine itself, in which case the number is divisible by nine and the remainder is zero).

This can be generalized to any standard positional system, in which the divisor in question then becomes one less than the radix; thus, in base-twelve, the digits will add up to the remainder of the original number if divided by eleven, and numbers are divisible by eleven only if the digit sum is divisible by eleven.

Example.
# 492 (The original number)
# 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 (Add each individual digit together)
# 15 is divisible by 3 at which point we can stop. Alternatively we can continue using the same method if the number is still too large:
# 1 + 5 = 6 (Add each individual digit together)
# 6 ÷ 3 = 2 (Check to see if the number received is divisible by 3)
# 492 ÷ 3 = 164 (If the number obtained by using the rule is divisible by 3, then the whole number is divisible by 3)

===Divisibility by 4===
The basic rule for divisibility by 4 is that if the number formed by the last two digits in a number is divisible by 4, the original number is divisible by 4; this is because 100 is divisible by 4 and so adding hundreds, thousands, etc. is simply adding another number that is divisible by 4. If any number ends in a two digit number that you know is divisible by 4 (e.g. 24, 04, 08, etc.), then the whole number will be divisible by 4 regardless of what is before the last two digits.

Alternatively, one can just add half of the last digit to the penultimate digit (or the remaining number). If that number is an even natural number, the original number is divisible by 4.

Also, one can simply divide the number by 2, and then check the result to find if it is divisible by 2. If it is, the original number is divisible by 4. In addition, the result of this test is the same as the original number divided by 4.

Example.&lt;br&gt;
General rule
# 2092 (The original number)
# 20 92 (Take the last two digits of the number, discarding any other digits)
# 92 ÷ 4 = 23 (Check to see if the number is divisible by 4)
# 2092 ÷ 4 = 523 (If the number that is obtained is divisible by 4, then the original number is divisible by 4)

Second method
#6174 (the original number)
# check that last digit is even, otherwise 6174 can&#x27;t be divisible by 4.
# 61 7 4 (Separate the last 2 digits from the rest of the number)
# 4 ÷ 2 = 2 (last digit divided by 2)
# 7 + 2 = 9 (Add half of last digit to the penultimate digit)
# Since 9 isn&#x27;t even, 6174 is not divisible by 4

Third method
# 1720 (The original number)
# 1720 ÷ 2 = 860 (Divide the original number by 2)
# 860 ÷ 2 = 430 (Check to see if the result is divisible by 2)
# 1720 ÷ 4 = 430 (If the result is divisible by 2, then the original number is divisible by 4)

===Divisibility by 5===
Divisibility by 5 is easily determined by checking the last digit in the number (475), and seeing if it is either 0 or 5. If the last number is either 0 or 5, the entire number is divisible by 5.

If the last digit in the number is 0, then the result will be the remaining digits multiplied by 2. For example, the number 40 ends in a zero, so take the remaining digits (4) and multiply that by two (4 × 2 = 8). The result is the same as the result of 40 divided by 5(40/5 = 8).

If the last digit in the number is 5, then the result will be the remaining digits multiplied by two, plus one. For example, the number 125 ends in a 5, so take the remaining digits (12), multiply them by two (12 × 2 = 24), then add one (24 + 1 = 25). The result is the same as the result of 125 divided by 5 (125/5=25).

Example.&lt;br&gt;
 If the last digit is 0
# 110 (The original number)
# 11 0 (Take the last digit of the number, and check if it is 0 or 5)
# 11 0 (If it is 0, take the remaining digits, discarding the last)
# 11 × 2 = 22 (Multiply the result by 2)
# 110 ÷ 5 = 22 (The result is the same as the original number divided by 5)

If the last digit is 5
# 85 (The original number)
# 8 5 (Take the last digit of the number, and check if it is 0 or 5)
# 8 5 (If it is 5, take the remaining digits, discarding the last)
# 8 × 2 = 16 (Multiply the result by 2)
# 16 + 1 = 17 (Add 1 to the result)
# 85 ÷ 5 = 17 (The result is the same as the original number divided by 5)

===Divisibility by 6===
Divisibility by 6 is determined by checking the original number to see if it is both an even number (divisible by 2) and divisible by 3. 

If the final digit is even the number is divisible by two, and thus may be divisible by 6. If it is divisible by 2 continue by adding the digits of the original number and checking if that sum is a multiple of 3. Any number which is both a multiple of 2 and of 3 is a multiple of 6.

Example.
# 324 (The original number)
# Final digit 4 is even, so 324 is divisible by 2, and may be divisible by 6.
# 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 which is a multiple of 3. Therefore the original number is divisible by both 2 and 3 and is divisible by 6.

===Divisibility by 7===
Divisibility by 7 can be tested by a recursive method. A number of the form 10&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is divisible by 7 if and only if &quot;x&quot; − 2&quot;y&quot; is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number is obtained for which it is known whether it is divisible by 7. The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7. For example, the number 371: 37 − (2×1) = 37 − 2 = 35; 3 − (2 × 5) = 3 − 10 = −7; thus, since −7 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.

Similarly a number of the form 10&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is divisible by 7 if and only if &quot;x&quot; + 5&quot;y&quot; is divisible by 7. So add five times the last digit to the number formed by the remaining digits, and continue to do this until a number is obtained for which it is known whether it is divisible by 7.

Another method is multiplication by 3. A number of the form 10&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; has the same remainder when divided by 7 as 3&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;. One must multiply the leftmost digit of the original number by 3, add the next digit, take the remainder when divided by 7, and continue from the beginning: multiply by 3, add the next digit, etc. For example, the number 371: 3×3 + 7 = 16 remainder 2, and 2×3 + 1 = 7. This method can be used to find the remainder of division by 7.

A more complicated algorithm for testing divisibility by 7 uses the fact that 100 ≡ 1, 101 ≡ 3, 102 ≡ 2, 103 ≡ 6, 104 ≡ 4, 105 ≡ 5, 106 ≡ 1, ... (mod 7). Take each digit of the number (371) in reverse order (173), multiplying them successively by the digits 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, repeating with this sequence of multipliers as long as necessary (1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, ...), and adding the products (1×1 + 7×3 + 3×2 = 1 + 21 + 6 = 28). The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7 (hence 371 is divisible by 7 since 28 is).

This method can be simplified by removing the need to multiply. All it would take with this simplification is to memorize the sequence above (132645...), and to add and subtract, but always working with one-digit numbers.

The simplification goes as follows:
*Take for instance the number 371
*Change all occurrences of 7, 8 or 9 into 0, 1 and 2, respectively. In this example, we get: 301. This second step may be skipped, except for the left most digit, but following it may facilitate calculations later on.
*Now convert the first digit (3) into the following digit in the sequence 13264513... In our example, 3 becomes 2.
*Add the result in the previous step (2) to the second digit of the number, and substitute the result for both digits, leaving all remaining digits unmodified: 2 + 0 = 2. So &quot;30&quot;1 becomes &quot;2&quot;1.
*Repeat the procedure until you have a recognizable multiple of 7, or to make sure, a number between 0 and 6. So, starting from 21 (which is a recognizable multiple of 7), take the first digit (2) and convert it into the following in the sequence above: 2 becomes 6. Then add this to the second digit: 6 + 1 = 7.
*If at any point the first digit is 8 or 9, these become 1 or 2, respectively. But if it is a 7 it should become 0, only if no other digits follow. Otherwise, it should simply be dropped. This is because that 7 would have become 0, and numbers with at least two digits before the decimal dot do not begin with 0, which is useless. According to this, our 7 becomes 0.

If through this procedure you obtain a 0 or any recognizable multiple of 7, then the original number is a multiple of 7. If you obtain any number from 1 to 6, that will indicate how much you should subtract from the original number to get a multiple of 7. In other words, you will find the remainder of dividing the number by 7. For example, take the number 186:
*First, change the 8 into a 1: 116.
*Now, change 1 into the following digit in the sequence (3), add it to the second digit, and write the result instead of both: 3 + 1 = &quot;4&quot;. So &quot;11&quot;6 becomes now &quot;4&quot;6.
*Repeat the procedure, since the number is greater than 7. Now, 4 becomes 5, which must be added to 6. That is 11.
*Repeat the procedure one more time: 1 becomes 3, which is added to the second digit (1): 3 + 1 = 4.

Now we have a number smaller than 7, and this number (4) is the remainder of dividing 186/7. So 186 minus 4, which is 182, must be a multiple of 7.

Note: The reason why this works is that if we have: a+b=c and b is a multiple of any given number n, then a and c will necessarily produce the same remainder when divided by n. In other words, in 2 + 7 = 9, 7 is divisible by 7. So 2 and 9 must have the same remainder when divided by 7. The remainder is 2.

Therefore, if a number &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 7 (i.e.: the remainder of &quot;n&quot;/7 is 0), then adding (or subtracting) multiples of 7 cannot change that property.

What this procedure does, as explained above for most divisibility rules, is simply subtract little by little multiples of 7 from the original number until reaching a number that is small enough for us to remember whether it is a multiple of 7. If 1 becomes a 3 in the following decimal position, that is just the same as converting 10×10&quot;n&quot; into a 3×10&quot;n&quot;. And that is actually the same as subtracting 7×10&quot;n&quot; (clearly a multiple of 7) from 10×10&quot;n&quot;.

Similarly, when you turn a 3 into a 2 in the following decimal position, you are turning 30×10&quot;n&quot; into 2×10&quot;n&quot;, which is the same as subtracting 30×10&quot;n&quot;−28×10n, and this is again subtracting a multiple of 7. The same reason applies for all the remaining conversions:
* 20×10&quot;n&quot; − 6×10&quot;n&quot;=14×10&quot;n&quot;
* 60×10&quot;n&quot; − 4×10&quot;n&quot;=56×10&quot;n&quot;
* 40×10&quot;n&quot; − 5×10&quot;n&quot;=35×10&quot;n&quot;
* 50×10&quot;n&quot; − 1×10&quot;n&quot;=49×10&quot;n&quot;

First method example&lt;br&gt;
1050 → 105 − 0=105 → 10 − 10 = 0. ANSWER: 1050 is divisible by 7.

Second method example&lt;br&gt;
1050 → 0501 (reverse) → 0×1 + 5×3 + 0×2 + 1×6 = 0 + 15 + 0 + 6 = 21 (multiply and add). ANSWER: 1050 is divisible by 7.

Vedic method of divisibility by osculation&lt;br&gt;
Divisibility by seven can be tested by multiplication by the &quot;Ekhādika&quot;. Convert the divisor seven to the nines family by multiplying by seven. 7×7=49. Add one, drop the units digit and, take the 5, the &quot;Ekhādika&quot;, as the multiplier. Start on the right. Multiply by 5, add the product to the next digit to the left. Set down that result on a line below that digit. Repeat that method of multiplying the units digit by five and adding that product to the number of tens. Add the result to the next digit to the left. Write down that result below the digit. Continue to the end. If the result is zero or a multiple of seven, then yes, the number is divisible by seven. Otherwise, it is not. This follows the Vedic ideal, one-line notation.

Vedic method example:
 Is 438,722,025 divisible by seven? Multiplier = 5.
 4 3 8 7 2 2 0 2 5
 42 37 46 37 6 40 37 27
 YES

Pohlman–Mass method of divisibility by 7&lt;br&gt;
The Pohlman–Mass method provides a quick solution that can determine if most integers are divisible by seven in three steps or less. This method could be useful in a mathematics competition such as MATHCOUNTS, where time is a factor to determine the solution without a calculator in the Sprint Round.

Step A:
If the integer is 1000 or less, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. If the result is a multiple of seven, then so is the original number (and vice versa). For example:

 112 -&gt; 11 − (2×2) = 11 − 4 = 7 YES
 98 -&gt; 9 − (8×2) = 9 − 16 = −7 YES
 634 -&gt; 63 − (4×2) = 63 − 8 = 55 NO

Because 1001 is divisible by seven, an interesting pattern develops for repeating sets of 1, 2, or 3 digits that form 6-digit numbers (leading zeros are allowed) in that all such numbers are divisible by seven. For example:

 001 001 = 1,001 / 7 = 143
 010 010 = 10,010 / 7 = 1,430
 011 011 = 11,011 / 7 = 1,573
 100 100 = 100,100 / 7 = 14,300
 101 101 = 101,101 / 7 = 14,443
 110 110 = 110,110 / 7 = 15,730

 01 01 01 = 10,101 / 7 = 1,443
 10 10 10 = 101,010 / 7 = 14,430

 111,111 / 7 = 15,873
 222,222 / 7 = 31,746
 999,999 / 7 = 142,857

 576,576 / 7 = 82,368

For all of the above examples, subtracting the first three digits from the last three results in a multiple of seven. Notice that leading zeros are permitted to form a 6-digit pattern.

This phenomenon forms the basis for Steps B and C.

Step B:
If the integer is between 1001 and one million, find a repeating pattern of 1, 2, or 3 digits that forms a 6-digit number that is close to the integer (leading zeros are allowed and can help you visualize the pattern). If the positive difference is less than 1000, apply Step A. This can be done by subtracting the first three digits from the last three digits. For example:

 341,355 − 341,341 = 14 -&gt; 1 − (4×2) = 1 − 8 = −7 YES
 67,326 − 067,067 = 259 -&gt; 25 − (9×2) = 25 − 18 = 7 YES

The fact that 999,999 is a multiple of 7 can be used for determining divisibility of integers larger than one million by reducing the integer to a 6-digit number that can be determined using Step B. This can be done easily by adding the digits left of the first six to the last six and follow with Step A.

Step C:
If the integer is larger than one million, subtract the nearest multiple of 999,999 and then apply Step B. For even larger numbers, use larger sets such as 12-digits (999,999,999,999) and so on. Then, break the integer into a smaller number that can be solved using Step B. For example:

 22,862,420 − (999,999 × 22) = 22,862,420 − 21,999,978 -&gt; 862,420 + 22 = 862,442
 862,442 -&gt; 862 − 442 (Step B) = 420 -&gt; 42 − (0×2) (Step A) = 42 YES

This allows adding and subtracting alternating sets of three digits to determine divisibility by seven. Understanding these patterns allows you to quickly calculate divisibility of seven as seen in the following examples:

Pohlman–Mass method of divisibility by 7, examples:

 Is 98 divisible by seven?
 98 -&gt; 9 − (8×2) = 9 − 16 = −7 YES (Step A)

 Is 634 divisible by seven?
 634 -&gt; 63 − (4×2) = 63 − 8 = 55 NO (Step A)

 Is 355,341 divisible by seven?
 355,341 − 341,341 = 14,000 (Step B) -&gt; 014 − 000 (Step B) -&gt; 14 = 1 − (4×2) (Step A) = 1 − 8 = −7 YES

 Is 42,341,530 divisible by seven?
 42,341,530 -&gt; 341,530 + 42 = 341,572 (Step C)
 341,572 − 341,341 = 231 (Step B)
 231 -&gt; 23 − (1×2) = 23 − 2 = 21 YES (Step A)

 Using quick alternating additions and subtractions:
 42,341,530 -&gt; 530 − 341 + 42 = 189 + 42 = 231 -&gt; 23 − (1×2) = 21 YES

Digit pair method of divisibility by 7

This method uses 1, −3, 2 pattern on the &quot;digit pairs&quot;. That is, the divisibility of any number by seven can be tested by first separating the number into digit pairs, and then applying the algorithm on three digit pairs (six digits). When the number is smaller than six digits, then fill zero&#x27;s to the right side until there are six digits. When the number is larger than six digits, then repeat the cycle on the next six digit group and then add the results. Repeat the algorithm until the result is a small number. The original number is divisible by seven if and only if the number obtained using this algorithm is divisible by seven. This method is especially suitable for large numbers.

&quot;Example 1:&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The number to be tested is 157514.
First we separate the number into three digit pairs: 15, 75 and 14.&lt;br&gt;
Then we apply the algorithm: 1 × 15 − 3 × 75 + 2 × 14 = 182&lt;br&gt;
Because the resulting 182 is less than six digits, we add zero&#x27;s to the right side until it is six digits.&lt;br&gt;
Then we apply our algorithm again: 1 × 18 − 3 × 20 + 2 × 0 = −42&lt;br&gt;
The result −42 is divisible by seven, thus the original number 157514 is divisible by seven.

&quot;Example 2:&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The number to be tested is 15751537186.&lt;br&gt;
(1 × 15 − 3 × 75 + 2 × 15) + (1 × 37 − 3 × 18 + 2 × 60) = −180 + 103 = −77&lt;br&gt;
The result −77 is divisible by seven, thus the original number 15751537186 is divisible by seven.

Another digit pair method of divisibility by 7

Method

This is a non-recursive method to find the remainder left by a number on dividing by 7:

# Separate the number into digit pairs starting from the ones place. Prepend the number with 0 to complete the final pair if required.
# Calculate the remainders left by each digit pair on dividing by 7.
# Multiply the remainders with the appropriate multiplier from the sequence 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, ... : the remainder from the digit pair consisting of ones place and tens place should be multiplied by 1, hundreds and thousands by 2, ten thousands and hundred thousands by 4, million and ten million again by 1 and so on.
# Calculate the remainders left by each product on dividing by 7.
# Add these remainders. 
# The remainder of the sum when divided by 7 is the remainder of the given number when divided by 7.
For example:

The number 194,536 leaves a remainder of 6 on dividing by 7.

The number 510,517,813 leaves a remainder of 1 on dividing by 7.

Proof of correctness of the method

The method is based on the observation that 100 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7. And since we are breaking the number into digit pairs we essentially have powers of 100.

1 mod 7 = 1

100 mod 7 = 2

10,000 mod 7 = 2^2 = 4

1,000,000 mod 7 = 2^3 = 8; 8 mod 7 = 1

100,000,000 mod 7 = 2^4 = 16; 16 mod 7 = 2

10,000,000,000 mod 7 = 2^5 = 32; 32 mod 7 = 4

And so on.

The correctness of the method is then established by the following chain of equalities:

Let N be the given number formula_2.

formula_3

formula_4

formula_5

formula_6

===Divisibility by 11 ===

Method

In order to check divisibility by 11, consider the alternating sum of the digits. For example with 907,071:

formula_7

so 907,071 is divisible by 11.

We can either start with formula_8 or formula_9 since multiplying the whole by formula_10 does not change anything.

Proof of correctness of the method

Considering that formula_11, we can write for any integer:

formula_12

=== Divisibility by 13 ===
Remainder Test
13 (1, −3, −4, −1, 3, 4, cycle goes on.)
If you are not comfortable with negative numbers, then use this sequence. (1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4)

Multiply the right most digit of the number with the left most number in the sequence shown above and the second right most digit to the second left most digit of the number in the sequence. The cycle goes on.

Example: What is the remainder when 321 is divided by 13?
Using the first sequence, &lt;br&gt;
Ans: 1 × 1 + 2 × −3 + 3 × −4 = −17
Remainder = −17 mod 13 = 9

Example: What is the remainder when 1234567 is divided by 13?
Using the second sequence, &lt;br&gt;
Answer: 7 × 1 + 6 × 10 + 5 × 9 + 4 × 12 + 3 × 3 + 2 × 4 + 1 × 1 = 178 mod 13 = 9
Remainder = 9

A recursive method can be derived using the fact that formula_13 and that formula_14. This implies that a number is divisible by 13 iff removing the first digit and subtracting 3 times that digit from the new first digit yields a number divisible by 13. We also have the rule that 10 x + y is divisible iff x + 4 y is divisible by 13. For example, to test the divisibility of 1761 by 13 we can reduce this to the divisibility of 461 by the first rule. Using the second rule, this reduces to the divisibility of 50, and doing that again yields 5. So, 1761 is not divisible by 13.

Testing 871 this way reduces it to the divisibility of 91 using the second rule, and then 13 using that rule again, so we see that 871 is divisible by 13.

==Beyond 30==
Divisibility properties of numbers can be determined in two ways, depending on the type of the divisor.

===Composite divisors===
A number is divisible by a given divisor if it is divisible by the highest power of each of its prime factors. For example, to determine divisibility by 36, check divisibility by 4 and by 9. Note that checking 3 and 12, or 2 and 18, would not be sufficient. A table of prime factors may be useful.

A composite divisor may also have a rule formed using the same procedure as for a prime divisor, given below, with the caveat that the manipulations involved may not introduce any factor which is present in the divisor. For instance, one cannot make a rule for 14 that involves multiplying the equation by 7. This is not an issue for prime divisors because they have no smaller factors.

===Prime divisors===
The goal is to find an inverse to 10 modulo the prime under consideration (does not work for 2 or 5) and use that as a multiplier to make the divisibility of the original number by that prime depend on the divisibility of the new (usually smaller) number by the same prime.
Using 31 as an example, since 10 × (−3) = −30 = 1 mod 31, we get the rule for using &quot;y&quot; − 3&quot;x&quot; in the table below. Likewise, since 10 × (28) = 280 = 1 mod 31 also, we obtain a complementary rule &quot;y&quot; + 28&quot;x&quot; of the same kind - our choice of addition or subtraction being dictated by arithmetic convenience of the smaller value. In fact, this rule for prime divisors besides 2 and 5 is &quot;really&quot; a rule for divisibility by any integer relatively prime to 10 (including 33 and 39; see the table below). This is why the last divisibility condition in the tables above and below for any number relatively prime to 10 has the same kind of form (add or subtract some multiple of the last digit from the rest of the number).

==Generalized divisibility rule==

To test for divisibility by &quot;D&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; ends in 1, 3, 7, or 9, the following method can be used. Find any multiple of &quot;D&quot; ending in 9. (If &quot;D&quot; ends respectively in 1, 3, 7, or 9, then multiply by 9, 3, 7, or 1.) Then add 1 and divide by 10, denoting the result as &quot;m&quot;. Then a number &quot;N&quot; = 10&quot;t&quot; + &quot;q&quot; is divisible by &quot;D&quot; if and only if &quot;mq&quot; + &quot;t&quot; is divisible by &quot;D&quot;. If the number is too large, you can also break it down into several strings with &quot;e&quot; digits each, satisfying either 10&quot;e&quot; = 1 or 10&quot;e&quot; = −1 (mod &quot;D&quot;). The sum (or alternating sum) of the numbers have the same divisibility as the original one.

For example, to determine whether 913 = 10 × 91 + 3 is divisible by 11, find that &quot;m&quot; = (11 × 9 + 1) ÷ 10 = 10. Then &quot;mq&quot; + &quot;t&quot; = 10 × 3 + 91 = 121; this is divisible by 11 (with quotient 11), so 913 is also divisible by 11. As another example, to determine whether 689 = 10 × 68 + 9 is divisible by 53, find that &quot;m&quot; = (53 × 3 + 1) ÷ 10 = 16. Then &quot;mq&quot; + &quot;t&quot; = 16 × 9 + 68 = 212, which is divisible by 53 (with quotient 4); so 689 is also divisible by 53.

Alternatively, any number &quot;Q&quot; = 10&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot; is divisible by &quot;n&quot; = 10&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;, such that gcd(&quot;n&quot;, 2, 5) = 1, if &quot;c&quot; + &quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)&quot;d&quot; = &quot;An&quot; for some integer &quot;A&quot;, where
formula_15

The first few terms of the sequence, generated by &quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), are 1, 1, 5, 1, 10, 4, 12, 2, ... .

The piece wise form of &quot;D&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and the sequence generated by it were first published by Bulgarian mathematician Ivan Stoykov in March 2020.

==Proofs==

===Proof using basic algebra===

Many of the simpler rules can be produced using only algebraic manipulation, creating binomials and rearranging them. By writing a number as the sum of each digit times a power of 10 each digit&#x27;s power can be manipulated individually.

====Case where all digits are summed====

This method works for divisors that are factors of 10 − 1 = 9.

Using 3 as an example, 3 divides 9 = 10 − 1. That means formula_16 (see modular arithmetic). The same for all the higher powers of 10: formula_17 They are all congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since two things that are congruent modulo 3 are either both divisible by 3 or both not, we can interchange values that are congruent modulo 3. So, in a number such as the following, we can replace all the powers of 10 by 1:

: formula_18

which is exactly the sum of the digits.

====Case where the alternating sum of digits is used====

This method works for divisors that are factors of 10 + 1 = 11.

Using 11 as an example, 11 divides 11 = 10 + 1. That means formula_19. For the higher powers of 10, they are congruent to 1 for even powers and congruent to −1 for odd powers:

: formula_20

Like the previous case, we can substitute powers of 10 with congruent values:

: formula_21

which is also the difference between the sum of digits at odd positions and the sum of digits at even positions.

====Case where only the last digit(s) matter====

This applies to divisors that are a factor of a power of 10. This is because sufficiently high powers of the base are multiples of the divisor, and can be eliminated.

For example, in base 10, the factors of 101 include 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, divisibility by 2, 5, and 10 only depend on whether the last 1 digit is divisible by those divisors. The factors of 102 include 4 and 25, and divisibility by those only depend on the last 2 digits.

====Case where only the last digit(s) are removed====

Most numbers do not divide 9 or 10 evenly, but do divide a higher power of 10&quot;n&quot; or 10&quot;n&quot; − 1. In this case the number is still written in powers of 10, but not fully expanded.

For example, 7 does not divide 9 or 10, but does divide 98, which is close to 100. Thus, proceed from

: formula_22

where in this case &quot;a&quot; is any integer, and &quot;b&quot; can range from 0 to 99. Next,

: formula_23

and again expanding

: formula_24

and after eliminating the known multiple of 7, the result is

: formula_25

which is the rule &quot;double the number formed by all but the last two digits, then add the last two digits&quot;.

====Case where the last digit(s) is multiplied by a factor====

The representation of the number may also be multiplied by any number relatively prime to the divisor without changing its divisibility. After observing that 7 divides 21, we can perform the following:

: formula_26

after multiplying by 2, this becomes

: formula_27

and then

: formula_28

Eliminating the 21 gives

: formula_29

and multiplying by −1 gives

: formula_30

Either of the last two rules may be used, depending on which is easier to perform. They correspond to the rule &quot;subtract twice the last digit from the rest&quot;.

===Proof using modular arithmetic===

This section will illustrate the basic method; all the rules can be derived following the same procedure. The following requires a basic grounding in modular arithmetic; for divisibility other than by 2&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s the proofs rest on the basic fact that 10 mod &quot;m&quot; is invertible if 10 and &quot;m&quot; are relatively prime.

====For 2&quot;n&quot; or 5&quot;n&quot;====

Only the last &quot;n&quot; digits need to be checked.

: formula_31

Representing &quot;x&quot; as formula_32

: formula_33

and the divisibility of &quot;x&quot; is the same as that of &quot;z&quot;.

====For 7====

Since 10 × 5 ≡ 10 × (−2) ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can do the following:

Representing &quot;x&quot; as formula_34

: formula_35

so &quot;x&quot; is divisible by 7 if and only if &quot;y&quot; − 2&quot;z&quot; is divisible by 7.

<text>Gérard Klein (born 1937), known also as Gilles, is a French science fiction writer with sociological training.

He is the editor of the prestigious science fiction series &quot;Ailleurs et Demain&quot; published by Robert Laffont and of the Le Livre de Poche science-fiction imprint.

In his novella &quot;Les virus ne parlent pas&quot; (&quot;The viruses do not speak&quot;), he imagines that viruses have created all living beings in the same fashion that human beings have created computers, and for the same reason: to improve their efficiency.

Klein used the pseudonym &quot;Gilles d&#x27;Argyre&quot; for his novels published by Editions Fleuve Noir for their series &quot;Anticipation&quot;.

Several of his novels were published in translation by DAW Books in the United States.

<doc id="991217" wikidata="Q167187" url="?curid=991217" title="Perspectivism">
<text>Perspectivism (also called perspectivalism) is the epistemological principle that perception of and knowledge of something are always bound to the interpretive perspectives of those observing it. While perspectivism regard all perspectives and interpretations as being of equal truth or value, it holds that no one has access to an absolute view of the world cut off from perspective. Instead, all such occurs from some point of view which in turn affects how things are perceived. Rather than attempt to determine truth by correspondence to things outside any perspective, perspectivism thus generally seeks to determine truth by comparing and evaluating perspectives among themselves. Perspectivism may be regarded as an early form of epistemological pluralism, though in some accounts includes treatment of value theory, moral psychology, and realist metaphysics.

Early forms of perspectivism have been identified in the philosophies of Protagoras, Michel de Montaigne, and Gottfried Leibniz. However, its first major statement is considered to be Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s development of the concept in the 19th century, influenced by Gustav Teichmüller&#x27;s use of the term some years prior. For Nietzsche, perspectivism takes the form of a realist antimetaphysics while rejecting both the correspondence theory of truth and the notion that the truth-value of a belief always constitutes its ultimate worth-value. The perspectival conception of objectivity used by Nietzsche sees the deficiencies of each perspective as remediable by an asymptotic study of the differences between them. This stands in contrast to Platonic notions in which objective truth is seen to reside in a wholly non-perspectival domain.

According to Alexander Nehamas, perspectivism is often misinterpreted as a form of relativism, whereby we acknowledge the true virtue of fully rejecting the &#x27;Law of excluded middle&#x27; regarding a particular proposition. Lacewing Michael adds that although perspectivism doesn&#x27;t accede to an objective view of the world that is detached from our subjectivity, our assessment of reality can still approach &quot;objectivity&quot; subjectively and asymptotically. Nehamas also describes how perspectivism does not prohibit someone from holding some interpretations to be definitively true. It only alerts us that we cannot objectively determine the truth from outside our perspective. The idea that perspectivism is an absolutely true thesis, is called &quot;weak perspectivism&quot; by Brian Lightbody.

The basic principle that things are perceived differently from different perspectives (or that perspective determines one&#x27;s limited and unprivileged access to knowledge) has sometimes been accounted as a rudimentary, uncontentious form of perspectivism. The basic practice of comparing contradictory perspectives to one another may also be considered one such form of perspectivism , as may the entire philosophical problem of how true knowledge is to penetrate one&#x27;s perspectival limitations.

== Precursors and early developments ==

In Western languages, scholars have found perspectivism in the philosophies of Heraclitus ( – ), Protagoras ( – ), Michel de Montaigne (1533 – 1592 CE), and Gottfried Leibniz (1646 – 1716 CE). The origins of perspectivism have also been found to lie also within Renaissance developments in philosophy of art and its artistic notion of perspective. In Asian languages, scholars have found perspectivism in Buddhist, Jain, and Daoist texts. Anthropologists have found a kind of perspectivism in the thinking of some indigenous peoples. Some theologians believe John Calvin interpreted various scriptures in a perspectivist manner.

=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===

The Western origins of perspectivism can be found in the pre-Socratic philosophies of Heraclitus and Protagoras. In fact, a major cornerstone of Plato&#x27;s philosophy is his rejection and opposition to perspectivism—this forming a principal element of his aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, and theology. The antiperspectivism of Plato made him a central target of critique for later perspectival philosophers such as Nietzsche.

=== Montaigne ===

Montaigne&#x27;s philosophy presents in itself a less as a doctrinaire position than as a core philosophical approach put into practice. Inasmuch as no one can occupy a God&#x27;s-eye view, Montaigne holds that no one has access to a view which is totally unbiased, which does not according to its own perspective. It is instead only the underlying psychological biases which view one&#x27;s own perspective as unbiased. In a passage from his &quot;Of Cannibals&quot;, he writes: 

== Nietzsche ==

In his works, Nietzsche makes a number of statements on perspective which at times contrast each other throughout the development of his philosophy. Nietzsche&#x27;s begins by challenging the underlying notions of &#x27;viewing from nowhere&#x27;, &#x27;viewing from everywhere&#x27;, and &#x27;viewing without interpreting&#x27; as being absurdities. Instead, all is attached to some perspective, and all viewers are limited in some sense to the perspectives at their command. In &quot;The Genealogy of Morals&quot; he writes: 

In this, Nietzsche takes a contextualist approach which rejects any God&#x27;s-eye view of the world. This has been further linked to his notion of the death of God and the dangers of a resulting relativism. However, Nietzsche&#x27;s perspectivism itself stands in sharp contrast to any such relativism. In outlining his perspectivism, Nietzsche rejects those who claim everything to be subjective, by disassembling the notion of the subject as itself a mere invention and interpretation. He further states that, since the two are mutually dependent on each other, the collapse of the God&#x27;s-eye view causes also the notion of the thing-in-itself to fall apart with it. Nietzsche views this collapse to reveal, through his genealogical project, that all that has been considered non-perspectival knowledge, the entire tradition of Western metaphysics, has itself been only a perspective. His perspectivism and genealogical project are further integrated into each other in addressing the psychological drives that underlie various philosophical programs and perspectives, as a form of critique. Here, contemporary scholar Ken Gemes views Nietzsche&#x27;s perspectivism to above all be a principle of moral psychology, rejecting interpretations of it as an epistemological thesis outrightly. It is through this method of critique that the deficiencies of various perspectives can be alleviated—through a critical mediation of the differences between them rather than any appeals to the non-perspectival. In a posthumously published aphorism from &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, Nietzsche writes: 

While Nietzsche does not plainly reject truth and objectivity, he does reject the notions of truth, facts, and objectivity.

=== Truth theory and the value of truth ===

Despite receiving much attention within contemporary philosophy, there is no academic consensus on Nietzsche&#x27;s conception of truth. While his perspectivism presents a number of challenges regarding the nature of truth, its more controversial element lies in its questioning of the of truth. Contemporary scholars Steven D. Hales and Robert C. Welshon write that: 

== Later developments ==
=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, perspectivism was discussed separately by José Ortega y Gasset and Karl Jaspers. Ortega&#x27;s perspectivism, replaced his previous position that &quot;man is completely social&quot;. His reversal is prominent in his work &quot;Verdad y perspectiva&quot; (&quot;Truth and perspective&quot;), where he explained that &quot;each man has a mission of truth&quot; and that what he sees of reality no other eye sees. He explained:From different positions two people see the same surroundings. However, they do not see the same thing. Their different positions mean that the surroundings are organized in a different way: what is in the foreground for one may be in the background for another. Furthermore, as things are hidden one behind another, each person will see something that the other may not.Ortega also maintained that perspective is perfected by the multiplication of its viewpoints. He noted that war transpires due to the lack of perspective and failure to see the larger contexts of the actions among nations. Ortega also cited the importance of phenomenology in perspectivism as he argued against speculation and the importance of concrete evidence in understanding truth and reality. In this discourse, he highlighted the role of &quot;circumstance&quot; in finding out the truth since it allows us to understand realities beyond ourselves.

=== 21st century ===
During the 21st century, perspectivism has led a number of developments within analytic philosophy and philosophy of science, particularly under the early influence of Ronald Giere, Jay Rosenberg, Ernest Sosa, and others. This contemporary form of perspectivism, also known as scientific perspectivism, is more narrowly focused than prior forms—centering on the perspectival limitations of scientific models, theories, observations, and focused interest, while remaining more compatible for example with Kantian philosophy and correspondence theories of truth. Furthermore, scientific perspecitivism has come to address a number of scientific fields such as physics, biology, cognitive neuroscience, and medicine, as well as interdisciplinarity and philosophy of time. Studies of perspectivism have also been introduced into contemporary anthropology, initially through the influence of Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and his research into indigenous cultures of South America.

<text>Sir Nicholas Andrew Serota (born 27 April 1946) is a British art historian and curator. He has been chairman of Arts Council England since February 2017.

Serota was director of the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, then director of the Whitechapel Gallery, London, and then director of the Tate from 1988 to 2017. He was also chairman of the Turner Prize jury until 2007.

==Early life==

Born and raised in Hampstead, North London, the only son of Stanley Serota, a civil engineer, and Beatrice Katz Serota, a civil servant, later a life peer and Labour Minister for Health in Harold Wilson&#x27;s government and local government ombudsman. His younger sister, Judith Serota, who also works in the arts, is married to Francis Pugh. Serota was educated at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School (where he became school captain) and then studied economics at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, before switching to history of art. He completed a master&#x27;s degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, under the supervision of Michael Kitson and Anita Brookner; his thesis was on the work of J. M. W. Turner.

In 1969, Serota became chairman of the new Young Friends of the Tate organisation with a membership of 750: they took over a building in Pear Place, south of Waterloo Bridge, arranging lectures and Saturday painting classes for local children. The Young Friends staged their own shows and applied for an Arts Council grant, but were asked to desist by the Tate chairman and trustees, who were concerned with the appearance of official backing for these ventures. Serota and his committee resigned, which precipitated the end of the Young Friends, whose accommodation was taken over for rehearsals by the National Theatre.

In 1970, Serota joined the Arts Council of Great Britain&#x27;s Visual Arts Department as a regional exhibitions officer. In 1973 he was made director of the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford), where he organised an early exhibition of work by Joseph Beuys and formed a working relationship with Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Nairne, with whom he worked at various points in the following years.

==Whitechapel directorship==

In 1976, Serota was appointed director of the Whitechapel Gallery in London&#x27;s East End. The Whitechapel was well regarded but had suffered from lack of resources. Serota assembled at the Whitechapel a staff including Jenni Lomax (later director of the Camden Arts Centre), Mark Francis (later of Gagosian Gallery) and Sheena Wagstaff (later chief curator of Tate Modern), and organised exhibitions of Carl Andre, Eva Hesse and Gerhard Richter as well as early exhibitions of then emerging artists such as Antony Gormley.

In 1976 he was a judge for an art competition run by the brewers Trumans. In 1980, assisted by Sandy Nairne, he organised a two-part exhibition of 20th century British sculpture. In 1981, he curated &quot;The New Spirit in Painting,&quot; with Norman Rosenthal and Christos Joachimides for the Royal Academy.

The shows, where Serota was helped by his administrator Loveday Shewell, often received adverse reviews in the press, which reacted with an uncharacteristic dislike for contemporary avant-garde art. Thus Serota remained somewhat distanced from the English establishment, although developing a growing reputation internationally in the art world.

In 1984–1985, Serota shut down the Whitechapel for over 12 months&#x27; extensive refurbishment. A strip of land had been acquired, which allowed a design by architects Colquhoun &amp; Miller for a first-floor gallery, restaurant, lecture theatre and other rooms. Although receiving wide approbation, the scheme was in deficit by £250,000. In 1987, Serota raised £1.4 million in an auction of work, which he had asked artists to donate, paying off the debt, and creating an endowment fund to allow future exhibitions of more unconventional work, unlikely to attract a commercial sponsor.

==Tate directorship==

The short-listed candidates for the Tate directorship, who included Norman Rosenthal and Julian Spalding, were asked to prepare a seven-year scheme for the Tate. Serota&#x27;s submission, on two sides of A4 paper, was titled &quot;Grasping the Nettle&quot;. It analysed the various areas of Tate work and proposed future strategies to deal with the imminent crisis caused by restricted government financial support, changing public sector management expectations and increasing art market prices. He saw many areas of the Tate&#x27;s operations in need of overhaul, and concluded that the gallery was loved, but not respected enough. Tate chairman, Sir Richard Rogers considered this by far the best proposal submitted.

News of Serota&#x27;s appointment as Tate director in 1988 was received enthusiastically by Howard Hodgkin, who wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Nick Serota has enormous energy and demonstrated at the Whitechapel a tremendous sense of diplomacy. He is a passionate man, and indeed is quite unusual in this country in his commitment to modern painting and sculpture.&quot;

In contrast, Peter Fuller made a scathing attack in &quot;Modern Painters&quot; magazine, saying that Serota would be incapable, by temperament and ability, of maintaining the Tate&#x27;s historic collection.

Major expansion of the Tate Gallery had been seen as inevitable for two decades. In 1993, the creation of the National Lottery made it possible to anticipate the availability of major public funding for an enlarged Gallery.

In 1995, Tate received £52 million towards the conversion of the former Bankside Power Station to create Tate Modern. The final cost was £135 million; Serota managed to secure the funds to make up the shortfall from a range of private sources. Tate Modern opened in May 2000 and quickly became a major tourist fixture of London. As well as housing acclaimed new works by Louise Bourgeois and Anish Kapoor, the Gallery has also provided the base for successful exhibitions of Donald Judd, Picasso, Matisse and Edward Hopper.

On 21 November 2000, Serota gave the Dimbleby Lecture in London starting by telling of a 1987 Civil Service enquiry which ranked the pay of the Tate Gallery director with that of larger museums such as the National Gallery, because the former &quot;has to deal with the very difficult problem of modern art.&quot; He explained it thus:

In 2016, Serota received a salary of between £165,000 and £169,999 from the Tate, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the UK public sector then, at the lower end of the senior officials &#x27;high-earners&#x27; list and well below what similar executives in public health, transport or government administrative top roles were earning.

In 1998, Serota conceived &quot;Operation Cobalt&quot;, the secret buy-back of two of the Tate&#x27;s Turner paintings that had been stolen in 1994 while they were on loan to a gallery in Frankfurt. The paintings were recovered in 2000 and 2002.

In December 2005, Serota admitted that he had submitted an application form with false information to the Art Fund (NACF) for a £75,000 grant to go towards buying the painting &quot;The Upper Room&quot;, stating that the Tate had made no commitment to purchase the work (a requirement of the grant), whereas they had already paid a first instalment of £250,000 several months previously. He attributed this to &quot;a failing in his head&quot;. The NACF allowed the Tate to keep the grant. In 2006, the Charity Commission ruled the Tate had broken charity law (but not criminal law) over the purchase and similar trustee purchases, including ones made before Serota&#x27;s directorship. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called the verdict &quot;one of the most serious indictments of the running of one of the nation&#x27;s major cultural institutions in living memory&quot;. In April 2008, Stuckist artist Charles Thomson started a petition on the Prime Minister&#x27;s website against Serota&#x27;s Tate directorship.

In September 2016, the Tate announced that Serota would step down as director in 2017, and he would become Chairman of Arts Council England, for the term 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2025. Serota was succeeded at the Tate by Maria Balshaw.

==Reactions==
Serota has been criticised by Platform and Liberate Tate for inviting increased sponsorship of the Tate from BP. Their demands were supported by 8,000 Tate members and visitors, and artists including Conrad Atkinson. When questioned about BP sponsorship during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Serota responded &quot;We all recognise they have a difficulty at the moment but you don&#x27;t abandon your friends because they have what we consider to be a temporary difficulty.&quot;

The art critic Brian Sewell coined the critical phrase &#x27;the Serota tendency&#x27; to refer to the popular BritArt movement of the 1990s that was favoured by Serota&#x27;s Tate and collectors such as Charles Saatchi.

Since its formation in 1999, the Stuckist art group has campaigned against Serota, who is the subject of the group&#x27;s co-founder Charles Thomson&#x27;s satirical painting &quot;Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision&quot; (2000), one of the best known Stuckist works and a likely &quot;signature piece&quot; for the movement. Serota was dubbed the &quot;least likely visitor&quot; to &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot; show at the Walker Art Gallery in 2004, which included a wall of work satirising him and the Tate, including Thomson&#x27;s painting. In fact, he did visit and met the artists, describing the work as &quot;lively&quot;. In 2005, the Stuckists offered 160 paintings from the Walker show as a donation to the Tate. Serota wrote to the Stuckists, saying that the work was not of &quot;sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection&quot;, and was accused of &quot;snubbing one of Britain&#x27;s foremost collections&quot;.

In 2001, Stuart Pearson Wright, winner of that year&#x27;s BP Portrait Award, said that Serota should be sacked, because of his advocacy of conceptual art and neglect of figurative painting.
==Honours==
Knighted in the 1999 New Year Honours and appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 2013 for &quot;services to art&quot;, 
Serota is also an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Serota married Angela Beveridge (divorced 1995), having two daughters, Anya and Beth. In 1997, he married Teresa Gleadowe, a curator and arts administrator, with whom he has two stepdaughters. Sir Nicholas and Lady Serota divide their time between homes in King&#x27;s Cross, London and Cornwall.

<text>The Dayton Gems were a minor league ice hockey team based in Dayton, Ohio, and members of the International Hockey League from 1964 to 1977, and 1979–1980.

The Gems were an expansion team assembled from various cast-offs and young players looking for their first break in minor league hockey. The team began play in 1964 in the new Hara Arena.

Dayton was the host for several IHL all-star games due to the large attendance in their 5,500 seat arena. The Gems played exhibition games against the US Olympic team as well as the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League. The team had a few games a season televised locally as well as all games broadcast on the premier AM radio station in town.

Other teams in the league copied the uniform styling of the Gems. The Dayton Gems were the first adult team in North America to make helmets mandatory, long before the NHL adopted them.

==Team history==
Local businessman Edgar “Lefty” McFadden provided the financial base for the team and acquired the team franchise for the International Hockey League. The Gems, taken from the nickname for Dayton, Ohio, the Gem City, were affiliated with the Boston Bruins for several years. The Bruins provided some of the players and the trainer for the team. In the 1970s, the Gems became an affiliate for the Washington Capitals.

After winning the Turner Cup two years in a row in 1968–69 and 1969–70, McFadden was selected as the minor league executive of the year. He then moved to Washington to assist the Capitals. The Gems struggled on and off the ice for the next few years as attendance decreased from 5,000 to 1,000 a game. The 1970s downturn in the economy, especially the auto industry, reduced disposable income in the community and negatively impacted attendance.

The Gems recovered to win their final Turner Cup in 1976. Their red, white and blue uniforms with the crest of a hockey player superimposed over a diamond, are on exhibit at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. The Gems went into dormancy after the 1976–77 season, and were resurrected for the 1979–80 season. The revived Gems lasted only one season before ceasing operations for good.

<doc id="991239" wikidata="Q1006053" url="?curid=991239" title="Federal Correctional Institution, Leavenworth">
<text>The Federal Correctional Institution, Leavenworth is a medium-security federal prison for male inmates in northeast Kansas. It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. It also includes a satellite federal prison camp (FPC) for minimum-security male offenders.

FCI Leavenworth is located in Leavenworth, Kansas, which is northwest of Kansas City, Kansas.

==Background==
FCI (formerly USP) Leavenworth, a civilian facility, is the oldest of three major prisons built on federal land in Leavenworth County, Kansas. It is separate from, but often confused with, the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB), a military facility located on the adjacent Fort Leavenworth army post. Located north of the FCI, the USDB is the sole maximum-security penal facility for the entire United States military. Prisoners from the original USDB were used to build the former civilian penitentiary. In addition, the military&#x27;s medium-security Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility (JRCF), located southwest of the new USDB, opened in 2010. The USDB and JRCF operate independently from FCI Leavenworth.

The prison was described by Pete Earley, the only writer at that time who had ever been granted unlimited access to the prison, in his book, &quot;The Hot House&quot;. The prison&#x27;s history has also been covered in a pictorial history titled &quot;U.S. Penitentiary Leavenworth&quot; by Kenneth M. LaMaster, the retired Institution Historian and J.H. Johnston III, a prominent member of the Leavenworth community 1933/3/18 - 2007, authored the book; &quot;Leavenworth: Beginning to Bicentennial&quot;. 

USP Leavenworth was the largest maximum-security federal prison in the United States from 1903 until 2005 when it was downgraded to a medium-security facility.

==Design==
USP Leavenworth was one of three first-generation federal prisons which were built in 1913. Prior to its construction, federal prisoners were held at state prisons. In 1895, Congress authorized the construction of the federal prison system.

The other two were Atlanta and McNeil Island (although McNeil dates to the 1870s the major expansion did not occur until the early 1900s).

The prison follows a format popularized at the Auburn Correctional Facility in New York where the cell blocks were in a large rectangular building. The rectangular building was focused on indoor group labor with a staff continually patrolling.

The Auburn system was a marked difference from the earlier Pennsylvania plan popularized at Eastern State Penitentiary in which cell blocks radiated out from a central building and was the original design for the nearby Disciplinary Barracks before it was torn down and replaced by a totally new prison.

The St. Louis, Missouri architecture firm of Eames and Young designed both Leavenworth and the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta. Leavenworth&#x27;s prison cells are back to back in the middle of the structure facing the walls. The prison&#x27;s walls are high, below the surface and long and enclose . Its domed main building was nicknamed the &quot;Big Top&quot; or &quot;Big House.&quot; The domed Disciplinary Barracks two miles (3 km) to the north was nicknamed the &quot;Little Top&quot; until it was torn down in 2004 and replaced with a newer structure.

==Historical timeline==

* 1827: Colonel Henry Leavenworth chose site for new fort.
* 1875: Fort chosen as the site for a military prison. Within a year, Fort Leavenworth housed more than 300 prisoners in a remodeled, supply-depot building.
* 1894: Secretary of War conceded to the House Appropriations Committee that War Department could do without the military prison.
* 1895 July 1: Congress transferred the military prison from the War Department to the US Department of Justice. The Department of Justice took over the plant and inaugurated the United States Penitentiary. Commandant of the military prison, James V. Pope. Warden of the USP, James W. French.
* 1896: House Judiciary Committee recommended that the facility be replaced.

==Notable inmates (current and former)==
==Famous escapees==
Frank Grigware, imprisoned for train robbery, escaped from Leavenworth in 1910 with five other men by smashing through the prison gates with a hijacked supply locomotive. While the others were quickly recaptured, Grigware escaped to Canada. In 1916 he became the mayor of Spirit River, Alberta. He was discovered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the FBI in 1933, but serious doubts about his original conviction led the U.S. to drop its extradition request in 1934. Grigware never returned to the U.S. and died in Alberta in 1977.

Basil Banghart escaped from Leavenworth three times. He escaped federal custody a fourth time while awaiting return to Leavenworth. 

On December 11, 1931, seven inmates took Warden Thomas B. White hostage and escaped, aided by the well-known gangsters Frank Nash, George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly, and Thomas James Holden.

==Executions==
On September 5, 1930, serial killer Carl Panzram, under a federal death sentence for murder, was hanged at USP Leavenworth. On August 12, 1938, two men under the sentence of death for murder, Robert Suhay and Glenn Applegate, were hanged at USP Leavenworth.

==Cemetery==

<doc id="991242" wikidata="Q1700185" url="?curid=991242" title="Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet (22 June 1593 – 26 October 1671) was an English landowner from Derbyshire, who acted as local Parliamentarian commander for most of the First English Civil War before resigning in May 1646. He was notorious for parading the body of his Royalist opponent through Derby after the Battle of Hopton Heath in March 1643. 

Reputedly the richest man in Derbyshire, Gell proved an effective and energetic general, but the plundering conducted by his often unpaid troops provoked numerous complaints to Parliament. According to Puritan diarist Lucy Hutchinson, he &quot;had not understanding to judge the equity of the cause, nor piety, nor holiness&quot;, while his men were &quot;the most licentious, ungovernable wretches that belonged to the Parliament&quot;.

Gell resigned his commission just before the First Civil War ended in 1646, and his ambiguous stance during the Second English Civil War meant he was removed from all his positions in February 1649. Implicated in a Royalist plot in 1650, he was sentenced to life imprisonment but released due to ill health three years later. Pardoned after the Stuart Restoration in 1660, he lived quietly in London where he died in October 1671.

==Personal details==
John Gell was born 22 June 1593 in Hopton, Derbyshire to Thomas Gell (1532–1594) and Millicent Sacheverell (1571–1618). His father died shortly before the birth of his younger brother Thomas (1594–1656), and his mother married John Curzon (1552–1632) of Kedleston Hall, where Gell lived until 1614. He formed a close relationship with his half-brother Sir John Curzon (1598–1686). 

In January 1609, Gell married Elizabeth Willoughby (1600–1642), daughter of Sir Percival Willoughby of Wollaton Hall in Nottinghamshire. They had six children who reached adulthood; Millicent (1611–1652), Bridgett (1612–1680), John (1613–1689), William (1615–1642), Elizabeth (1617–1707) and Eleanor (1620–1713). 

In 1648, he married Mary Stanhope (died 1653), widow of Sir John Stanhope, an act that provoked much comment among his neighbours. She belonged to the leading Royalist family in Derbyshire while Gell had pursued a long running feud first with her husband, then with her brother-in-law after the former&#x27;s death in 1638. The marriage lasted less than a year. 

==Prior to 1642==
Gell graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1610, then lived in Kedleston before taking up residence in Hopton around 1620. One of the wealthiest men in Derbyshire, his income derived chiefly from sheep and extensive interests in the lead industry. These included Royalty payments on lead produced from mines near Bakewell, Hope and Tideswell; his combative nature led to lengthy legal disputes over the amounts due and made him unpopular locally. 

Gell contributed only a nominal amount of £10 to the 1625 Forced Loan and refused to fund the local Trained Band in 1630, marking him as an opponent of Charles I. During the period of Personal Rule from 1629 to 1640, one response was to put such men in charge of collecting payments due to the Crown, thereby making them liable for the entire amount. In 1632, Gell and his brother Thomas were appointed joint Receivers of the Honour of Tutbury, the name given to the Derbyshire and Staffordshire estates of the Duchy of Lancaster, a royal possession. Gell was also made High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1635, responsible for collecting the highly controversial tax known as Ship Money. 

The methods adopted by the Gell brothers included seizing property in lieu of unpaid Duchy rents or Ship money, causing widespread local resentment. One of those affected was Sir John Stanhope; when he died in 1638, his wife Mary and cousin Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield, took their case to the Privy Council. They lost, but the feud continued into the First English Civil War when Chesterfield supported the Royalists. With war approaching, Charles sought to raise money by selling honours and in January 1642 Gell purchased a baronetcy for £300.

==First English Civil War 1642–1646==
As a Presbyterian, Gell&#x27;s sympathies generally lay with Parliament, but the importance of the Derbyshire lead mines for manufacturing ammunition meant Charles unsuccessfully tried to win his support. When the war began in August 1642, Gell was instructed to secure Derbyshire for Parliament and recruited a regiment with his brother Thomas as lieutenant colonel. The local Royalists were led by Chesterfield; when he ransacked Hopton Hall, Gell retaliated by sacking his residence at Bretby Hall. He followed up by plundering Elvaston Castle, former residence of Sir John Stanhope, allegedly defacing his tomb in the local church and digging up his flower beds. 

In March 1643, Gell joined Lord Brooke in an attack on Lichfield Cathedral, which was occupied by a Royalist garrison under Chesterfield. After Brooke was killed by a sniper, Gell took command and captured the position along with Chesterfield, who was held in London until 1649. He then combined with Sir William Brereton in an attack on Stafford, which ended in the inconclusive Battle of Hopton Heath on 19 March. The Parliamentarian artillery was captured but the Royalist commander, the Earl of Northampton, was killed after refusing to surrender. Gell offered to hand over the body in return for his artillery; when this was refused, he had Northampton&#x27;s embalmed corpse paraded through the streets of Derby before burial.

While Lichfield was soon retaken by the Royalists, Gell replaced Brooke as Parliamentarian commander in Staffordshire and Warwickshire and was appointed Governor of Derby in 1644. Although an energetic and capable soldier, his bullying of the Derbyshire county committee and the plundering for which his unpaid troops became notorious provoked numerous complaints to Parliament. The formation of the New Model Army in April 1645 reduced his influence while he resented Derbyshire being used as a base by its troops. He reportedly ignored orders from Sir Thomas Fairfax to bring his troops to Naseby in June, then was reprimanded for allowing 3,000 cavalry from the defeated Royalist army to escape him at Ashbourne. 

As the war came to an end in April 1646, it was discovered that he was negotiating more favourable terms with the Royalist garrison of Tutbury Castle than those offered by his colleague Sir William Brereton. He resigned his commission and went to London seeking payment of expenses he claimed were owed him; as a precaution, he first signed over his estates to his son John, keeping an annuity of £1,100 for himself.

==Post 1646==
In 1645, Thomas Gell replaced the Royalist William Allestry as MP for Derby and helped his brother obtain a grant of £1,200 from Parliament towards his arrears in October 1647. During the internal power struggle over the post-war political settlement that dominated 1647 and 1648, Gell sided with the Parliamentarian moderates against the New Model Army. Previously the only person in Derbyshire excluded by Charles from the general pardon offered to his opponents in 1643, Gell now to pay the king £900 in return for a pardon. 

Hopes of regaining his influence ended with Royalist defeat in the Second English Civil War and the Execution of Charles I in January 1649. Thomas was one of the MPs excluded by Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648, while Gell himself was stripped of all offices in February 1649. During the Interregnum in 1650, he was involved in a conspiracy to restore Charles II led by the Royalist lawyer Eusebius Andrews, who was acting on his behalf in his divorce proceedings with Mary Stanhope. Although Gell was careful not to commit himself, one of his retainers was subsequently executed, and he was found guilty of failing to communicate details of the plot. The transfer of his estates in 1646 thwarted attempts to confiscate them, although he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Tower of London. In 1653, he was released on grounds of ill health and allowed to live in a private house in London. 

Following the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, he was formally pardoned and given a minor position in the Royal Household. He lived in London where he died on 26 October 1671, and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wirksworth.

<text>The Boeing X-37, also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is a reusable robotic spacecraft. It is boosted into space by a launch vehicle, then re-enters Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and lands as a spaceplane. The X-37 is operated by the Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, in collaboration with United States Space Force, for orbital spaceflight missions intended to demonstrate reusable space technologies. It is a 120-percent-scaled derivative of the earlier Boeing X-40. The X-37 began as a NASA project in 1999, before being transferred to the United States Department of Defense in 2004. Until 2019, the program was managed by Air Force Space Command.

An X-37 first flew during a drop test in 2006; its first orbital mission was launched in April 2010 on an Atlas V rocket, and returned to Earth in December 2010. Subsequent flights gradually extended the mission duration, reaching in orbit for the fifth mission, the first to launch on a Falcon 9 rocket. The sixth mission launched on an Atlas V on 17 May 2020 and concluded on 12 November 2022, reaching a total of 908 days in orbit. The seventh mission launched on 28 December 2023 on a Falcon Heavy rocket, entering a highly elliptical high Earth orbit.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
In 1999, NASA selected Boeing Integrated Defense Systems to design and develop an orbital vehicle, built by the California branch of Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works. Over a four-year period, a total of $192 million was spent on the project, with NASA contributing $109 million, the U.S. Air Force $16 million, and Boeing $67 million. In late 2002, a new $301 million contract was awarded to Boeing as part of NASA&#x27;s Space Launch Initiative framework.

The aerodynamic design of the X-37 was derived from the larger Space Shuttle orbiter, hence the X-37 has a similar lift-to-drag ratio, and a lower cross range at higher altitudes and Mach numbers compared to DARPA&#x27;s Hypersonic Technology Vehicle. An early requirement for the spacecraft called for a total mission delta-v of for orbital maneuvers. An early goal for the program was for the X-37 to rendezvous with satellites and perform repairs. The X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical.

The X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on 13 September 2004. Thereafter, the program became a classified project because of its military applications. DARPA promoted the X-37 as part of the independent space policy that the United States Department of Defense has pursued since the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

===Glide testing===
The X-37A vehicle that was used as an atmospheric drop test glider had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle&#x27;s payload bay doors, it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. In September 2004, DARPA announced that for its initial atmospheric drop tests the X-37A would be launched from the Scaled Composites White Knight, a high-altitude research aircraft.

On 21 June 2005, the X-37A completed a captive-carry flight underneath the White Knight from Mojave Spaceport in Mojave, California. Through the second half of 2005, the X-37A underwent structural upgrades, including the reinforcement of its nose wheel supports. The X-37A&#x27;s public debut for its first free flight, scheduled for 10 March 2006, was canceled due to an Arctic storm. The next flight attempt, on 15 March 2006, was canceled due to high winds.

On 24 March 2006, the X-37A flew again but a datalink failure prevented a free flight and the vehicle returned to the ground still attached to its White Knight carrier aircraft. On 7 April 2006, the X-37A made its first free glide flight. During landing, the vehicle overran the runway and sustained minor damage. Following the vehicle&#x27;s extended downtime for repairs, the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, for the remainder of the flight test program. White Knight continued to be based at Mojave, though it was ferried to Plant 42 when test flights were scheduled. Five additional flights were thought to have been performed, two of which resulted in X-37 releases with successful landings. These two free flights occurred on 18 August 2006 and 26 September 2006.

===X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle===
On 17 November 2006, the U.S. Air Force announced that it would develop its own variant of NASA&#x27;s X-37A. The Air Force version was designated the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV). The OTV program was built on earlier industry and government efforts by DARPA, NASA, and the Air Force under the leadership of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office in partnership with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Boeing was the prime contractor for the OTV program. The X-37B was designed to remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time. The Secretary of the Air Force stated that the OTV program would focus on &quot;risk reduction, experimentation, and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies, in support of long-term developmental space objectives&quot;.

The X-37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, but after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, it was transferred to a Delta II 7920. The X-37B was subsequently transferred to a shrouded configuration on the Atlas V rocket, due to concerns over the unshrouded spacecraft&#x27;s aerodynamic properties during launch. Following their missions, X-37B spacecraft primarily land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, with Edwards Air Force Base as a secondary site. In 2010, manufacturing work began on the second X-37B, which conducted its maiden mission in March 2011.

On 8 October 2014, NASA confirmed that X-37B vehicles would be housed at Kennedy Space Center in Orbiter Processing Facilities (OPF) 1 and 2, hangars previously occupied by the Space Shuttle. Boeing had said the space planes would use OPF-1 in January 2014, and the Air Force had previously said it was considering consolidating X-37B operations, housed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, nearer to their launch site at Cape Canaveral. NASA also stated that the program had completed tests to determine whether the X-37B, one-fourth the size of the Space Shuttle, could land on the former Shuttle runways. NASA furthermore stated that renovations of the two hangars would be completed by the end of 2014; the main doors of OPF-1 were marked with the message &quot;Home of the X-37B&quot; by this point.

====Speculation regarding purpose====
Most of the activities of the X-37B project are secret. The official Air Force statement is that the project is &quot;an experimental test program to demonstrate technologies for a reliable, reusable, uncrewed space test platform for the U.S. Air Force&quot;. The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold: reusable spacecraft technology and operating experiments, which can be returned to Earth. The Air Force states that this includes testing avionics, flight systems, guidance and navigation, thermal protection, insulation, propulsion, and re-entry systems.

In May 2010, Tom Burghardt speculated on &quot;Space Daily&quot; that the X-37B could be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space. The Pentagon subsequently denied claims that the X-37B&#x27;s test missions supported the development of space-based weapons.

In January 2012, allegations were made that the X-37B was being used to spy on China&#x27;s Tiangong-1 space station module. Former U.S. Air Force orbital analyst Brian Weeden later rejected this claim, emphasizing that the different orbits of the two spacecraft precluded any practical surveillance flybys.

In October 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported the claims of security experts that the X-37B was being used &quot;to test reconnaissance and spy sensors, particularly how they hold up against radiation and other hazards of orbit&quot;.

In November 2016, the &quot;International Business Times&quot; speculated that the U.S. government was testing a version of the EmDrive electromagnetic microwave thruster on the fourth flight of the X-37B. In 2009, an EmDrive technology transfer contract with Boeing was undertaken via a State Department TAA and a UK export license, approved by the UK Ministry of Defence. Boeing has since stated that it is no longer pursuing this area of research. The U.S. Air Force has stated that the X-37B is testing a Hall-effect thruster system for Aerojet Rocketdyne.

In July 2019, former United States Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson explained that when an X-37B was in an elliptic orbit it could, at perigee, use the thin atmosphere to make an orbit change preventing some observers from discovering the new orbit for a while, permitting secret activities.

===Processing===
Processing for the X-37 is carried out inside Bays 1 and 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the vehicle is loaded with its payload. The X-37 is then placed inside a fairing along with its stage adapter and transported to the launch site. Previous launch sites have included SLC-41 and Kennedy Space Center LC-39A.

Landing is done at one of three sites across the US: the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, Vandenberg Space Force Base, or Edwards Air Force Base. To return to Kennedy Space Center, the X-37 is placed into a payload canister and loaded into a Boeing C-17 cargo plane. Once at Kennedy, the X-37 is unloaded and towed to the OPF, where it is prepared for its next flight. Technicians must wear protective suits due to toxic hypergolic gases.

==Design==
The X-37 Orbital Test Vehicle is a reusable robotic spaceplane. It is an approximately 120-percent-scale derivative of the Boeing X-40, measuring over in length, and features two angled tail fins. The X-37 launches atop an Atlas V 501 or a SpaceX Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rocket. The spaceplane is designed to operate in a speed range of up to Mach 25 on its reentry.

The technologies demonstrated in the X-37 include an improved thermal protection system, enhanced avionics, an autonomous guidance system and an advanced airframe. The spaceplane&#x27;s thermal protection system is built upon previous generations of atmospheric reentry spacecraft, incorporating silica ceramic tiles. The X-37&#x27;s avionics suite was used by Boeing to develop its CST-100 crewed spacecraft. The development of the X-37 was to &quot;aid in the design and development of NASA&#x27;s Orbital Space Plane, designed to provide a crew rescue and crew transport capability to and from the International Space Station&quot;, according to a NASA fact sheet.

The X-37 for NASA was to be powered by one Aerojet AR2-3 engine using storable propellants, providing thrust of . The human-rated AR2-3 engine had been used on the dual-power NF-104A astronaut training vehicle and was given a new flight certification for use on the X-37 with hydrogen peroxide/JP-8 propellants. This was reportedly changed to a hypergolic nitrogen-tetroxide/hydrazine propulsion system.

The X-37 lands automatically upon returning from orbit and is the third reusable spacecraft to have such a capability, after the Soviet &quot;Buran&quot; shuttle and the U.S. space shuttle, which had automatic landing capability by the mid-1990s, but never tested it. The X-37 is the smallest and lightest orbital spaceplane flown to date; it has a launch mass of around and is approximately one quarter the size of the Space Shuttle orbiter.

On 13 April 2015, the Space Foundation awarded the X-37 team with the 2015 Space Achievement Award &quot;for significantly advancing the state of the art for reusable spacecraft and on-orbit operations, with the design, development, test and orbital operation of the X-37B space flight vehicle over three missions totaling 1,367 days in space&quot;.

==Operational history==
The two operational X-37Bs have completed six orbital missions; they have spent a combined 3,774.4 days (10.34 years) in space.

===OTV-1===

The first X-37B launched on its first mission – OTV-1/USA-212 – on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 22 April 2010 at 23:52 UTC. The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing. While the U.S. Air Force revealed few orbital details of the mission, a worldwide network of amateur astronomers claimed to have identified the spacecraft in orbit. On 22 May 2010, the spacecraft was in an inclination of 39.99°, circling the Earth once every 90 minutes on an orbit . OTV-1 reputedly passed over the same given spot on Earth every four days, and operated at an altitude that is typical for military surveillance satellites. Such an orbit is also common among civilian LEO satellites, and the spaceplane&#x27;s altitude was the same as that of the ISS and most other crewed spacecraft.

The U.S. Air Force announced a 3–6 December landing on 30 November 2010. As scheduled, the X-37B was de-orbited, reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and landed successfully at Vandenberg AFB on 3 December 2010, at 09:16 UTC, conducting the first US autonomous orbital landing onto a runway. This was the first such landing since the Soviet Buran shuttle in 1988. In all, OTV-1 spent in space. OTV-1 suffered a tire blowout during landing and sustained minor damage to its underside.

===OTV-2===
The second X-37B launched on its inaugural mission, designated OTV-2/USA-226, aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 5 March 2011 at 22:46 UTC. The mission was classified and described by the U.S. military as an effort to test new space technologies. On 29 November 2011, the U.S. Air Force announced that it would extend USA-226 beyond the 270-day baseline duration. In April 2012, General William L. Shelton of the Air Force Space Command declared the ongoing mission a &quot;spectacular success&quot;.

On 30 May 2012, the Air Force stated that the X-37B would land at Vandenberg AFB in June 2012. The spacecraft landed autonomously on 16 June 2012, having spent in space.

===OTV-3===
The third mission and second flight of the first X-37B, OTV-3 was originally scheduled to launch on 25 October 2012, but was postponed because of an engine issue with the Atlas V launch vehicle. It was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 11 December 2012 at 18:03 UTC. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was designated USA-240. Landing occurred at Vandenberg AFB on 17 October 2014 at 16:24 UTC, after a total time in orbit of .

===OTV-4 (AFSPC-5) ===
The fourth X-37B mission, OTV-4, was codenamed AFSPC-5 and designated as USA-261 in orbit. It was the second flight of the second X-37B vehicle. The X-37B launched on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 20 May 2015 at 15:05 UTC. Objectives included a test of Aerojet Rocketdyne&#x27;s XR-5A Hall-effect thruster in support of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency communications satellite program, and a NASA investigation on the performance of various materials in space for at least 200 days. The vehicle spent what was then a record-breaking in orbit before landing at Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility on 7 May 2017 at 11:47 UTC.

===OTV-5===
The fifth X-37B mission, designated USA-277 in orbit, was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A on 7 September 2017 at 14:00 UTC, just before the arrival of Hurricane Irma. The launch vehicle was a Falcon 9 rocket, and a number of small satellites also shared the ride. The spacecraft was inserted at a higher inclination orbit than previous missions, further expanding the X-37B&#x27;s envelope. During the flight, the spacecraft modified its orbit using an on-board propulsion system. While the complete payload for OTV-5 is classified, the Air Force announced that one experiment flying is the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader II (ASETS-II), which measures the performance of an oscillating heat pipe. The mission was completed with the vehicle landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility on 27 October 2019 at 07:51 UTC.

=== OTV-6 (USSF 7) ===

The sixth X-37B mission (OTV-6), U.S. Space Force 7 (formerly known as AFSPC 7), launched on an Atlas V 501 rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 17 May 2020 at 13:14:00 UTC. This mission is the first time the spaceplane has carried a service module, a ring attached to the rear of the vehicle for hosting multiple experiments. The mission hosts more experiments than prior X-37B flights, including two NASA experiments. One is a sample plate evaluating the reaction of select materials to conditions in space. The second studies the effect of ambient space radiation on seeds. A third experiment designed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) transforms solar power into radio frequency microwave energy, then studies transmitting that energy to Earth. The X-37B remains a Department of the Air Force asset, but the newly established U.S. Space Force is responsible for the launch, on-orbit operations, and landing.

The X-37B released a small, satellite named FalconSat-8 (USA-300) around 28 May 2020. Developed by United States Air Force Academy cadets in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the small satellite carries five experimental payloads. The spacecraft will test a novel electromagnetic propulsion system, low-weight antenna technology and a commercial reaction wheel to provide attitude control in orbit. According to the United States Air Force Academy, FalconSat-8&#x27;s experiments include:
* Magnetogradient Electrostatic Plasma Thruster (MEP) – Novel electromagnetic propulsion system
* MetaMaterial Antenna (MMA) – Low size, weight, power antenna with phased array-like performance
* Carbon nanotube experiment (CANOE) – RF cabling with carbon nanotube braiding flexed using shape-memory alloy
* Attitude Control and Energy Storage (ACES) – Commercial reaction wheel modified into a flywheel for energy storage and release
* SkyPad – Off-the-shelf cameras and GPUs integrated into low-SWAP (size, weight and power) package

The mission was completed with the vehicle landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility on 12 November 2022 at 10:22 UTC.

===OTV-7 (USSF-52) ===
The fourth flight of second X-37B and seventh overall X-37B mission was planned to be launched on SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon Heavy on 12 December 2023. This was rescheduled for 28 December 2023, when it was successfully launched at 8:07 pm EST (01:07:00 UTC on December 29). The orbit is higher than any spaceplane, in a highly elliptical HEO orbit.
In October 2024, OTV-7 was due to undertake aerobraking maneuvers to safely dispose of its service module.

==Variants==

===X-37A===
The X-37A Approach and Landing Test Vehicle (ALTV) was an initial NASA version of the spacecraft used in drop glide tests in 2005 and 2006.

===X-37B===
The X-37B is a modified version of the NASA X-37A, built for the U.S. Air Force. Two have been built and used for multiple orbital missions.

===X-37C===
In 2011, Boeing announced plans for a scaled-up variant of the X-37B, referring to it as the X-37C. This spacecraft was planned to be between 165% and 180% of the size of the X-37B, allowing it to transport up to six astronauts inside a pressurized compartment housed in the cargo bay. The Atlas V was this variant&#x27;s proposed launch vehicle. In this role, Boeing&#x27;s X-37C could potentially compete with the corporation&#x27;s CST-100 Starliner commercial space capsule. , with NASA selecting Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon, there has been no further announcement to develop X-37C.

<text>TELCOMP was a programming language developed at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) in about 1964 and in use until at least 1974. BBN offered TELCOMP as a paid service, with first revenue in October 1965. The service was sold to On-Line Systems, Inc. (OLS) in 1972. In the United Kingdom, TELCOMP was offered by Time Sharing, Ltd, a partnership between BBN and an entrepreneur named Richard Evans.

It was an interactive, conversational language based on JOSS, developed by BBN after Cliff Shaw from RAND visited the labs in 1964 as part of the NIH survey. It was first implemented on the PDP-1 and was used to provide a commercial time sharing service by BBN in the Boston area and later by Time Sharing Ltd. in the United Kingdom.

In 1996, Leo Beranek said &quot;We even developed a programming language called TELCOMP that to this day, some say was better than the programming language that the industry adopted, namely BASIC.&quot;

There were at least three versions: TELCOMP I, TELCOMP II, and TELCOMP III.

TELCOMP I was implemented on the PDP-1, TELCOMP II on the PDP-7 and TELCOMP III on the PDP-10, running on DEC
&#x27;s TOPS-10 operating system or on BBN&#x27;s own TENEX operating system.

TELCOMP programs were normally input via a paper tape reader on a Teletype Model 33, which would be connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line. Data could be read from the paper tape reader or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the paper tape punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data.

During data input using a Teletype, the user would type a response to a printed prompt. If, instead of hitting , the user hit , another, possibly computed, prompt would be printed on the same line. This process could be repeated for the full width of the line. This unusual feature allowed very compact data entry, comparable to full-screen CRT data entry. It saved paper, and the input section of the form became part of the program&#x27;s printed output.

A later derivative of TELCOMP called STRINGCOMP was oriented towards string handling. Another BBN JOSS-derivative called FILECOMP was developed for the GE MEDINET system, which was cancelled. The implicit file handling system it contained was influential on the MUMPS global database system.

The initial research for LOGO was carried out in TELCOMP, but only the JOSS-style errors and interaction made it through to the actual language.

==Commands==
A TELCOMP program was made up of numbered lines, each line referred to as a Step. Steps were grouped into Parts. Each line contained one instruction.

 DEMAND Read input from the teletype
 DO PART Execute all of the steps in a numbered part and then return
 DO STEP Execute a single line and return
 DONE Stop execution of current part and return to caller
 IF Condition, suffixed to any instruction
 FOR Loop, suffixed to any instruction
 PLOT Type output to the teletype in the form of a graph
 PRINT Print output to the teletype
 READ Read input from the paper tape reader
 SEND Send output to the paper tape punch
 SET Assign a variable to the value of an expression
 STOP Stop execution completely
 TO PART Go to a specified part
 TO STEP Go to a specified line
 TYPE Emulate teletype input while in stored operation mode (like the TCL/TK Expect functionality)
 ; Comment, suffixed to any line
 FORM A specification for formatted output (not really a command)

<text>Kevin Douglas Stocker (born February 13, 1970) is an American former Major League Baseball shortstop and switch hitter. Stocker played with the Philadelphia Phillies (1993–1997), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1998–2000) and Anaheim Angels (2000).

A 1988 graduate of Central Valley High School in Spokane Valley, Stocker attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he played college baseball for the Huskies from 1989–1991. Stocker was also a member of the fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha.

Stocker was selected by Philadelphia in the 1991 MLB draft, taken in the second round with the 54th overall selection. He made his major league debut in 1993 on July 7 at Veterans Stadium in a marathon game that lasted 6 hours and 10 minutes. Stocker played all 20 innings in the defeat of the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-6. Stocker was credited with a game-saving play in the tenth inning when he made a miraculous throw to home-plate for a force-out. Stocker had nine plate appearances in the game, the most by any player in his Major League debut. , no other player has had more than seven.

In his rookie season, Stocker batted .324 with two home runs and 31 RBI in 70 games. He was the regular Phillies shortstop through the 1997 season. In 1997 he enjoyed his best season, compiling career-highs in games played (149), runs (51), doubles (23) and stolen bases (11), adding five triples, four homers and 41 RBI.

During the 1997 expansion draft, Stocker was traded to Tampa Bay in exchange for Bobby Abreu. After two-plus seasons, he was released and signed with Anaheim. In an eight-season career, Stocker batted .254 with 23 home runs and 248 RBI. He now owns an Emerald City Smoothie franchise in Washington.

==Post-playing career==
Stocker has served as a color analyst for 14 seasons (as of 2014). He is currently in his second season with the Pac-12 Network, after a stint with CBS Sports Network.

In January 2018, it was announced that Stocker would be serving as a part-time color analyst for Phillies radio broadcasts during the 2018 season. Stocker rejoined the radio broadcast team in 2022. Stocker is their radio color commentator for road broadcasts. Stocker also handles home game broadcasts in which Larry Andersen is not available.

<text>Petronilla of Aquitaine ( 1125 – c.1151) was a French noble. She was the second daughter of William X of Aquitaine and Aénor of Châtellerault. She was the elder sister of William Aigret and the younger sister of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was Queen consort of France, later England. She is variously called Alix (or Aelith in Occitan) and Petronilla; she typically went by Alix after her marriage, while Petronilla seems to have been her childhood name (she is referred to as such in her father&#x27;s will).

==Life==
Petronilla accompanied her sister to the French court, where she met Count Raoul I of Vermandois, who was a married man and a cousin to her brother-in-law Louis VII of France. He repudiated his wife and married her, and they were excommunicated by Pope Innocent II in 1142. Hostilities broke out, and Louis VII infamously burned Vitry-en-Perthois in 1145. Pope Eugenius III renewed the excommunication in 1145, but eventually lifted it at the Council of Reims in 1148.

The exact date of Petronilla&#x27;s death is unknown, although she must have died at some point between the Council of Reims in 1148 and 1152 when Raoul was married for a third time to Laure, daughter of Thierry of Alsace, count of Flanders. Petronilla was buried in the Cluniac priory of Saint-Arnoul in Crépy-en-Valois, where Raoul was later interred alongside her.

==Issue==
Together Raoul and Petronilla had three children:

*Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois also known as &quot;Isabelle Mabile&quot; (1143 – 28 March 1183), married Philip, Count of Flanders.
*Ralph II, Count of Vermandois (1145–1167), married Margaret I, Countess of Flanders.
*Eleanor, Countess of Vermandois (1148/49 – 1213), married four times.

==In fiction and literature==
*Petronilla is a main character in several novels that deal with her sister&#x27;s life, including:
*Elizabeth Chadwick - &quot;The Summer Queen&quot; (2014) 
*Cecelia Holland - &quot;The Secret Eleanor&quot; (2010)
*Sharon Penman 
**&quot;Time and Chance&quot; (2002) 
**&quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2009) 
*Alison Weir – &quot;The Captive Queen&quot; (2010)

<doc id="991283" wikidata="Q4730296" url="?curid=991283" title="Allah Hoo">
<text>Allah Hoo (Allāhu) is a traditional Sufi chant (dhikr) consisting of the word for God (, &quot;&quot;) run together three times, followed by Truth (haqq): &quot;Allāhu Allāhu Allāhu Haqq&quot;, itself repeated three times over. According to Sufi tradition, this formula was introduced by Abu Bakr as he initiated the Naqshbandi tradition. Other Dhikrs consist of simple &quot;Allāhu Allāhu&quot; run together 400 or 600 times.

&quot;Allah Hoo&quot; is also a popular title for Urdu-language Sufi devotional qawwalis.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Hoo&quot; is due to the nominative suffix (i`rab) &quot;-u&quot; (ḍamma) being pronounced before initial vowel, as the word &quot;Allahu&quot; is run together several times: &quot;Allahu Allahu Allahu&quot; is rendered as /al:a:hual:a:hual:a:h/ (compare the phrase &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; where the &quot;-u&quot; is also audible). In traditional Sufi chant, the length of the &quot;-u&quot; is exaggerated. As a noun phrase, the chant is interpreted as meaning &quot;God is&quot;. Haqq is the Arabic for &quot;truth&quot;, so that the full dhikr translates to &quot;God is. God is. God is Truth.&quot; 

A Na&#x27;at starts off like this: &quot;Allahu diya paiyan pukaran aqa aye ayan bharan&quot;.

==Qawwali==
Qawwalis titled &quot;Allah Hoo&quot; have been performed by many different qawwals. Although these songs have the same title, many of them are totally different songs. For example, the &quot;Allah Hoo&quot; that appears on the Sabri Brothers 1978 album &quot;Qawwali: Sufi Music from Pakistan&quot; is totally different from the song that became one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s signature qawwalis, and this in turn is totally different from Qawwal Bahauddin&#x27;s version on the 1991 Shalimar compilation video titled &quot;Tajdar-e-Haram, vol. 2&quot; (although all three songs do have some lyrics in common). Versions of the song have also been sung by many other qawwals and Sufi singers, including Hans Raj Hans, Master Salim, Faiz Ali Faiz, and the Nooran Sisters. Versions of the song have been translated into other languages. An English version is sung by Sami Yusuf on the album &quot;Al-Muʽallim&quot; (2003), while a Malay version is sung by a popular Malaysian Nasheed group Raihan.

It is also a song by Sufi rock musician Salman Ahmad, formerly of Junoon, the Pakistani rock band.

In 1st season of &quot;Coke Studio (Pakistan)&quot;, &quot;Allah Hu&quot; was sung by Ali Zafar along with Saaein Tufail Ahmed in 2008.

In 2nd season of &quot;Coke Studio (India)&quot;, &quot;Allah Hu&quot; was sung by Nooran Sisters composed by Hitesh Sonik in 2012.

&quot;Allah Hu&quot; in its basic naat form was penned by the late Maulana Syed Hasan Imdad of Pakistan.

<doc id="991296" wikidata="Q25543948" url="?curid=991296" title="Culture of Ireland">
<text>The culture of Ireland includes the art, music, dance, folklore, traditional clothing, language, literature, cuisine and sport associated with Ireland and the Irish people. For most of its recorded history, the country’s culture has been primarily Gaelic (see Gaelic Ireland). Strong family values, wit and an appreciation for tradition are commonly associated with Irish culture.

Irish culture has been greatly influenced by Christianity, most notably by the Roman Catholic Church, and religion plays a significant role in the lives of many Irish people. Today, there are often notable cultural differences between those of Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox background. References to God can be found in spoken Irish, notably exemplified by the Irish equivalent of “Hello” — “Dia dhuit” ( &quot;God be with you&quot;).

Irish culture has Celtic, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, French and Spanish influences. It also has British influences, primarily due to over eight centuries of British rule in Ireland, which suppressed numerous aspects of Irish culture. The Vikings first invaded Ireland in the 8th century, from Denmark, Norway and Sweden in modern-day Scandinavia. They had a significant influence on Ireland’s material culture at the time. The Normans invaded Ireland in the 12th century, bringing British and French influences. Additionally, Irish Travellers (Shelta: &quot;Mincéirí&quot;) have had some influence on the broader cultural tapestry of Ireland, introducing nomadic traditions and other cultural practices. In recent decades, Ireland has also to some degree been influenced by migration from Eastern Europe.

Due to large-scale emigration from Ireland, Irish culture has a wide reach in the world, and festivals such as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day () and Halloween (which finds its roots in the Gaelic festival Samhain) are celebrated across much of the globe. Irish culture has to some extent been inherited and modified by the Irish diaspora, which in turn has influenced the home country. Moreover, the culture of Ireland is to some degree influenced by its native folklore and legends, such as those detailed in &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;.

== Farming and rural tradition ==
As archaeological evidence from sites such as the Céide Fields in County Mayo and Lough Gur in County Limerick demonstrates, the farm in Ireland is an activity that goes back to the Neolithic, about 6,000 years ago. Before this, the first settlers of the island of Ireland after the last Ice Age were a new wave of cavemen and the Mesolithic period. In historic times, texts such as the Táin Bó Cúailinge show a society in which cows represented a primary source of wealth and status. Little of this had changed by the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. Giraldus Cambrensis portrayed a Gaelic society in which cattle farming and transhumance was the norm.

=== Townlands, villages, parishes and counties ===
The Normans replaced traditional clan land management (under Brehon Law) with the manorial system of land tenure and social organisation. This led to the imposition of the village, parish and county over the native system of townlands. In general, a parish was a civil and religious unit with a manor, a village and a church at its centre. Each parish incorporated one or more existing townlands into its boundaries. With the gradual extension of English feudalism over the island, the Irish county structure came into existence and was completed in 1610. These structures are still of vital importance in the daily life of Irish communities. Apart from the religious significance of the parish, most rural postal addresses consist of house and townland names. The village and parish are key focal points around which sporting rivalries and other forms of local identity are built and most people feel a strong sense of loyalty to their native county, a loyalty which also often has its clearest expression on the sports field.

=== Land ownership and &quot;land hunger&quot; ===

With the Tudor Elizabethan English conquest in the 16th-17th centuries, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, and the organized plantations of English Tudor, and later Scottish, colonists, the Scottish confined to what&#x27;s now mostly Northern Ireland, the patterns of land ownership in Ireland were altered greatly. The old order of transhumance and open range cattle breeding died out to be replaced by a structure of great landed estates, small tenant farmers with more or less precarious hold on their leases, and a mass of landless labourers. This situation continued up to the end of the 19th century, when the agitation of the Land League began to bring about land reform. In this process of reform, the former tenants and labourers became land owners, with the great estates being broken up into small- and medium-sized farms and smallholdings. The process continued well into the 20th century with the work of the Irish Land Commission. This contrasted with Britain, where many of the big estates were left intact. One consequence of this is the widely recognised cultural phenomenon of &quot;land hunger&quot; amongst the new class of Irish farmer. In general, this means that farming families will do almost anything to retain land ownership within the family unit, with the greatest ambition possible being the acquisition of additional land. Another is that hillwalkers in Ireland today are more constrained than their counterparts in Britain, as it is more difficult to agree rights of way with so many small farmers involved on a given route, rather than with just one landowner.

=== Irish Travellers ===
Irish Travellers (Shelta: &quot;Mincéirí&quot;) are known for their historically nomadic lifestyle; residing in ornamented barrel top wagons, they would traverse predominantly rural areas of the island. Their propensity for rural living was influenced by a variety of factors including cultural traditions, a desire for privacy and autonomy, work opportunities and their fondness of the natural world. Travellers would often find work in rural areas, predominantly in farming, horse trading and tinsmithing. While many Mincéirí in contemporary Ireland are now settled, including in urban areas, they often maintain rural traditions such as horseback riding, and attend traditional fairs and festivals in the countryside.

== Holidays and festivals ==
Christmas in Ireland has several local traditions. On 26 December (St. Stephen&#x27;s Day), there is a custom of &quot;Wrenboys&quot; who call door to door with an arrangement of assorted material (which changes in different localities) to represent a dead wren &quot;caught in the furze&quot;, as their rhyme goes.

The national holiday in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, that falls on the date 17 March and is marked by parades and festivals in cities and towns across the island of Ireland, and by the Irish diaspora around the world. The festival is in remembrance of Saint Patrick, the most significant of Ireland&#x27;s three patron saints. Pious legend credits Patrick with the banishing of the snakes from the island, and the legend also credits Patrick with teaching the Irish about the concept of the Trinity by showing people the shamrock, a 3-leaved clover, using it to highlight the Christian belief of &#x27;three divine persons in the one God&#x27;.

In Northern Ireland The Twelfth of July, or Orangemen&#x27;s Day, commemorates William III&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Boyne. A public holiday, it is celebrated by Irish Protestants, in particular Ulster Protestants, the vast majority of whom live in Northern Ireland. It is notable for the numerous parades organised by the Orange Order which take place throughout Northern Ireland. These parades are colourful affairs with Orange Banners and sashes on display and include music in the form of traditional songs such as &quot;The Sash&quot; and &quot;Derry&#x27;s Walls&quot; performed by a mixture of pipe, flute, accordion, and brass marching bands. The Twelfth remains controversial as many in Northern Ireland&#x27;s large and majority-nationalist Catholic community see the holiday, celebrating a victory over Catholics that ensured the continued establishment of a Protestant Ascendancy, as triumphalist, supremacist, and an assertion of British and Ulster Protestant dominance.

The 1st of February, known as St. Brigid&#x27;s Day (after St. Brigid, one of the patron saints of Ireland) or Imbolc, also does not have its origins in Christianity, being instead another religious observance superimposed at the beginning of spring. St. Brigid’s Day is the only official public holiday named after a woman in Ireland. The Brigid&#x27;s cross made from rushes represents a pre-Christian solar wheel.

Other pre-Christian festivals, whose names survive as Irish month names, are Bealtaine (May), Lúnasa (August) and Samhain (November). The last is still widely observed as Halloween which is celebrated all over the world, including in the United States followed by All Saints&#x27; Day, another Christian holiday associated with a traditional one. Important church holidays include Easter, and various Marian observances.

== Religion ==

Christianity was brought to Ireland during or prior to the 5th century and its early history among the Irish is in particular associated with Saint Patrick, who is generally considered Ireland&#x27;s leading patron saint. The Celtic festival of &quot;Samhain&quot;, not to be confused with Halloween, originated in Ireland and a reconstructed version is celebrated by some across the globe.

Ireland is a place where religion and religious practice have long been held in high esteem. The majority of people on the island are Roman Catholics; however, there are significant Protestant and Orthodox minorities. Protestants are mostly concentrated in Northern Ireland, where they long made up a plurality of the population. The three main Protestant denominations on the island are the Anglican Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and the Methodist Church in Ireland. These are also joined by numerous other smaller denominations including Baptists, several American gospel groups and the Salvation Army. Orthodox Christianity also has a notable presence in Ireland, where it has been the fastest growing religion since 1991, largely due to immigration from Eastern Europe. Other minority denominations of Christianity include Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS). In addition to the Christian denominations there are centres for Buddhists, Hindus, Baháʼís, Pagans and for people of the Islamic and Jewish faiths.

In the 2021 Census, of those in the Republic of Ireland that stated their religious identity, 81.6% identified as Christian; 68.8% as Roman Catholic, 4.2% as Protestant, 2.1% as Orthodox, 0.7% as other Christians, while 1.6% identified as Muslim, 0.7% as Hindu, 14.8% as having no religion and 7.1% not stating their religious identity. Amongst the Republic&#x27;s Roman Catholics, weekly church attendance has declined sharply over the past few decades, from 87% in 1981, to 60% in 1998, to 30% in 2021. Still, this remains one of the higher attendance rates in Europe. The decline is said to be linked to reports of Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Ireland.

== Mythology and folklore ==
Highly respected in Ireland historically were the stories of heroes such as Fionn mac Cumhaill and his followers, the Fianna, from the Fenian cycle, and Cuchulain from the Ulster Cycle, along with some of the High Kings. Legend has it that Fionn mac Cumhaill built the Giant&#x27;s Causeway as a line of stepping-stones to Scotland, not to get his feet wet while seeking to fight an ugly Scottish giant. He also is said to have once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the Irish Sea – the clump becoming the Isle of Man, a pebble Rockall, and the void left behind filling as Lough Neagh. The Irish king Brian Boru who ended the domination of the so-called High Kingship of Ireland by the Uí Néill, is part of the historical cycle. The Irish princess Iseult is the adulterous lover of Tristan in the Arthurian romance and tragedy Tristan and Iseult. The many legends of ancient Ireland were captured by many collators, including Lady Gregory in two volumes with forewords by W. B. Yeats. These stories depict a status for Celtic women in ancient times somewhat different from many other cultures of the period.

According to the tales, the leprechaun is a mischievous fairy type creature in emerald green clothing who when not playing tricks spend all their time busily making shoes; he is said to have a pot of gold hidden at the end of the rainbow and if ever captured by a human has the magical power to grant three wishes in exchange for release. There are also tales of the pooka and banshees, among others.
Halloween is a traditional and much celebrated holiday in Ireland on the night of 31 October. Supposedly the first evidence of the word halloween is found in a 16th-century Scottish document as a shortening for &quot;All-Hallows-Eve&quot;, and according to some historians it has its roots in the gaelic festival Samhain, where the Gaels believed the border between this world and the otherworld became thin, and the dead would revisit the mortal world. In Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include; Guising – children disguised in costume going from door to door requesting food or coins – which became practice by the late 19th century, turnips hollowed-out and carved with faces to make lanterns, holding parties where games such as apple bobbing are played. Other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays. Mass transatlantic Irish and Scottish immigration in the 19th century popularised Halloween in the United States and Canada.

== Literature and the arts ==
For a comparatively small place, the island of Ireland has made a disproportionately large contribution to world literature in all its branches, in both the Irish and English languages. The island&#x27;s most widely known literary works are undoubtedly in English. Particularly famous examples of such works are those of James Joyce, Bram Stoker, Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde and Ireland&#x27;s four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature; William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Three of the four Nobel prize winners were born in Dublin (Heaney being the exception, having lived in Dublin but being born in County Londonderry), making it the birthplace of more Nobel literary laureates than any other city in the world. The Irish language has the third oldest literature in Europe (after Greek and Latin), the most significant body of written literature (both ancient and recent) of any Celtic language, as well as a strong oral tradition of legends and poetry. Poetry in Irish represents the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.

The early history of Irish visual art is generally considered to begin with early carvings found at sites such as Newgrange and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts, particularly ornamental gold objects, and the Celtic brooches and illuminated manuscripts of the &quot;Insular&quot; early medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong indigenous tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy.
The Irish tradition of folk music and dance is also widely known, and both were redefined in the 1950s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was attempting to modernise, traditional Irish music fell out of favour to some extent, especially in urban areas. Young people at this time tended to look to Britain and, particularly, the United States as models of progress and jazz and rock and roll became extremely popular. During the 1960s, and inspired by the American folk music movement, there was a revival of interest in the Irish tradition. This revival was inspired by groups like The Dubliners, the Clancy Brothers and Sweeney&#x27;s Men and individuals like Seán Ó Riada. The annual Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann is the largest festival of Irish music in Ireland. Groups and musicians like Horslips, Van Morrison and even Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of traditional music into a rock idiom to form a unique new sound. During the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock and pop musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing as a matter of course. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of bands like U2, Snow Patrol, The Cranberries, The Undertones and The Corrs, and individual artists such as Enya.

== Languages ==

Irish and English are the most widely spoken languages in Ireland. English is the most widely spoken language on the island overall, and Irish is spoken as a first language only by a small minority, primarily, though not exclusively, in the government-defined Gaeltacht regions in the Republic. A larger minority have Irish as a second language, with 40.6% of people in the Republic of Ireland claiming some ability to speak the language in the 2011 census. Article 8 of the Constitution of Ireland states that Irish is the &quot;national&quot; and &quot;first official&quot; language of the Republic of Ireland. English in turn is recognised as the State&#x27;s &quot;second official language&quot;. Hiberno-English, the dialect of English spoken in most of the Republic of Ireland, has been greatly influenced by Irish.

In Northern Ireland, English is a &quot;de facto&quot; official language, with Ulster English being common. In 2022, the Irish language received official language status in Northern Ireland as a result of the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act, with Ulster Scots receiving minority language status. In addition, these languages have recognition under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, with 8.1% claiming some ability in Ulster Scots and 10.7% in Irish. In addition, the dialect and accent of the people of Northern Ireland is noticeably different from that of the majority in the Republic of Ireland, being influenced by Ulster Scots and Northern Ireland&#x27;s proximity to Scotland.

Several other languages are spoken on the island, including Shelta, a mixture of Irish, Romani and English, spoken widely by Travellers. Two sign languages have also been developed on the island, Northern Irish Sign Language and Irish Sign Language; they have quite different bases.

Some other languages have entered Ireland with immigrants – for example, Polish is now the second most widely spoken language in Ireland after English, Irish being the third most commonly spoken language.

== Food and drink ==
=== Pre-Medieval Ireland ===

There are many references to food and drink in early Irish literature. Honey seems to have been widely eaten and used in the making of mead. The old stories also contain many references to banquets, although these may well be greatly exaggerated and provide little insight into everyday diet. There are also many references to &quot;fulacht fia&quot;, which are archaeological sites commonly believed to have once been used for cooking venison. The &quot;fulacht fia&quot; have holes or troughs in the ground which can be filled with water. Meat can then be cooked by placing hot stones in the trough until the water boils. Many &quot;fulach fia&quot; sites have been identified across the island of Ireland, and some of them appear to have been in use up to the 17th century.

Excavations at the Viking settlement in the Wood Quay area of Dublin have produced a significant amount of information on the diet of the inhabitants of the town. The main animals eaten were cattle, sheep and pigs, with pigs being the most common. This popularity extended down to modern times in Ireland. Poultry and wild geese as well as fish and shellfish were also common, as were a wide range of native berries and nuts, especially hazel. The seeds of knotgrass and goosefoot were widely present and may have been used to make a porridge.

=== Early-modern Ireland ===
The Tudor conquest of Ireland led to significant changes in the Irish diet, as it introduced a new agro-alimentary system of intensive grain-based agriculture and led to large areas of land being turned over to grain production. The potato was introduced into Ireland in the second half of the 16th century, as a result of the Columbian exchange, initially as a garden crop; it eventually came to serve as the main food field crop of the tenant and labouring classes, which formed a majority of the population. Ireland also grew large quantities of corned beef, though the vast majority of it was exported. The over-reliance on potatoes as a staple crop in Irish cuisine meant that the people of Ireland were vulnerable to poor potato harvests. The Irish Famine of 1740 was the result of extreme cold weather, but the Great Famine of 1845–1849 was caused by potato blight which spread throughout the Irish crop which consisted largely of a single variety, the Lumper. During the famine, approximately one million people died and a million more emigrated elsewhere.

=== Modern Ireland ===
In the 21st century, the modern selection of foods common to Western cultures has also to some extent been adopted in Ireland. Both US fast food culture and continental European dishes have influenced the country, along with other world dishes introduced in a similar fashion to the Western world. In addition to Irish food, meals eaten in Ireland may include pizza, curry and Chinese food, with some west African dishes making an appearance lately. Supermarket shelves now contain ingredients for, among others, traditional, Polish, Mexican, Indian and Chinese dishes.

The proliferation of fast food has led to increasing public health problems including obesity, and one of the highest rates of heart disease in the world. In Ireland, the Full Irish has been particularly cited as being a major source for a higher incidence of cardiac problems, quoted as being a &quot;heart attack on a plate&quot;. All the ingredients are fried, although more recently the trend is to grill as many of the ingredients as possible.

In tandem with these developments, the last quarter of the century saw the emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, especially salmon and trout, oysters and other shellfish, traditional soda bread, the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being made across the country, and, of course, the potato. Traditional dishes, such as the Irish stew, Dublin coddle, the Irish breakfast and potato bread, have enjoyed a resurgence. Schools like the Ballymaloe Cookery School have emerged to cater for the associated increased interest in cooking with traditional ingredients.
== Pub culture ==

&quot;Pub culture&quot; refers to the habit amongst Irish people of frequenting public houses (pubs). It extends beyond mere alcohol consumption (upon which it is not dependent), encompassing a variety of social traditions. Pubs vary widely according to the clientele they serve, and the area they are in. Best known, and loved amongst tourists is the traditional pub, with its traditional Irish music (or &quot;trad music&quot;) often performed live, tavern-like warmness, memorabilia and traditional Irish ornamentation. Often such pubs will also serve Irish food, particularly during the day. Typically pubs are important meeting places, where people can gather and meet their neighbours and friends in a relaxed atmosphere; similar to the café cultures of other countries. Many modern pubs, not necessarily traditional, still emulate traditional pubs, only perhaps substituting traditional music for a DJ or non-traditional live music.

Many larger pubs in cities eschew such trappings entirely, opting for loud music, and focusing more on the consumption of drinks, which is not a focus of traditional Irish culture. Such venues are popular &quot;pre-clubbing&quot; locations. &quot;Clubbing&quot; has become a popular phenomenon amongst young people in Ireland during the celtic tiger years. Clubs usually vary in terms of the type of music played, and the target audience. Belfast has a unique underground club scene taking place in settings such as churches, zoos, and crematoriums. The underground scene is mainly orchestrated by DJ Christopher McCafferty .
A significant recent change to pub culture in the Republic of Ireland has been the introduction of a smoking ban, in all workplaces, which includes pubs and restaurants. Ireland was the first country in the world to implement such a ban which was introduced on 29 March 2004. A majority of the population support the ban, including a significant percentage of smokers. Nevertheless, the atmosphere in pubs has changed greatly as a result, and debate continues on whether it has boosted or lowered sales, although this is often blamed on the ever-increasing prices, or whether it is a &quot;good thing&quot; or a &quot;bad thing&quot;. A similar ban, under the Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, came into effect in Northern Ireland on 30 April 2007.

National and international organisations have labelled Ireland as having a problem with over-consumption of alcohol. In the late 1980s alcohol consumption accounted for nearly 25% of all hospital admissions. While this figure has been decreasing steadily, as of 2007, approximately 13% of overall hospital admissions were alcohol related. In 2003, Ireland had the second-highest per capita alcohol consumption in the world, just below Luxembourg at 13.5 litres (per person 15 or more years old), according to the &quot;OECD Health Data 2009&quot; survey. According to the latest OECD figures, alcohol consumption in Ireland has dropped from 11.5 litres per adult in 2012 to 10.6 litres per adult in 2013. However, research showed that in 2013, 75% of alcohol was consumed as part of a drinking session where the person drank six or more standard units (which equates to three or more pints of beer). This meets the Health Service Executive&#x27;s definition of binge drinking.

== Sport ==

Sport on the island of Ireland is popular and widespread. A wide variety of sports are played throughout the island, with the most popular being Gaelic football, hurling, soccer, rugby union, and golf.
Four sports account for over 80% of event attendance: Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, and represents 34% of total sports attendances at events in the Republic of Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%. and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in Ireland&#x27;s sporting calendar.

Swimming, golf, aerobics, soccer, cycling, Gaelic football, and billiards, pool and snooker, are the sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation. Other sports with material playing populations, including at school level, include tennis, hockey, pitch and putt, rugby, basketball, boxing, cricket and squash. Significant numbers attend horse racing meetings, and Ireland breeds and trains many racehorses; greyhound racing also has dedicated racecourses.

Soccer is the most popular sport involving national teams. The success of the Ireland team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup saw 500,000 fans in Dublin to welcome the team home. The team&#x27;s song &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot; topped the Irish charts for 13 weeks.

In Ireland most sports, including rugby union, Gaelic football, hurling and handball, cycling and golf, are organised on an all-island basis, with, where relevant, a single team representing the island of Ireland in international competitions. A few sports, such as soccer, have separate organising bodies in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Traditionally, those in the North who identify as Irish, predominantly Catholics and nationalists, support the Republic of Ireland team. At the Olympics, a person from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either the &quot;Great Britain&quot; team or the &quot;Ireland&quot; team. Also as Northern Ireland is a Home Nation of the United Kingdom it also sends a Northern Ireland Team to the Commonwealth Games every four years.

== Media ==
=== Print ===

In the Republic of Ireland there are several daily newspapers, including the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, &quot;The Irish Examiner&quot;, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;The Star&quot;, &quot;The Evening Herald&quot;, &quot;Daily Ireland&quot;, the &quot;Irish Sun&quot;, and the Irish language &quot;Lá Nua&quot;. The best selling of these is the Irish Independent, which is published in both tabloid and broadsheet form. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; is Ireland&#x27;s newspaper of record.

The Sunday market is quite saturated with many British publications. The leading Sunday newspaper in terms of circulation is The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;. Other popular papers include &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot;, &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot; and the &quot;Sunday World&quot;.

In Northern Ireland the three main daily newspapers are The News Letter, which is Unionist in outlook, The Irish News, mainly Nationalist in outlook and the Belfast Telegraph. Also widely available are the Northern Irish versions of the main UK wide daily newspapers and some Scottish dailies such as the Daily Record.

In terms of Sunday papers the Belfast Telegraph is the only one of the three main Northern Irish dailies that has a Sunday publication which is called the Sunday Life. Apart from this all the main UK wide Sunday papers such as The Sun on Sunday are widely available as are some Irish papers such as the Sunday world.

There are quite a large number of local weekly newspapers both North and South, with most counties and large towns having two or more newspapers. Curiously Dublin remains one of the few places in Ireland without a major local paper since the &quot;Dublin Evening Mail&quot; closed down in the 1960s. In 2004 the &quot;Dublin Daily&quot; was launched, but failed to attract enough readers to make it viable.

One major criticism of the Republic of Ireland newspaper market is the strong position Independent News &amp; Media has on the market. It controls the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday World&quot; and &quot;The Star&quot; as well as holding a large stake in the cable company Chorus, and indirectly controlling &quot;The Sunday Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Independent&quot; titles are perceived by many Irish republicans as having a pro-British stance. In parallel to this, the &quot;Independent&quot; titles are perceived by many opposition supporters as being pro Fianna Fáil.

The Irish magazine market is one of the world&#x27;s most competitive, with hundreds of international magazines available in Ireland, ranging from &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; to &quot;Hello!&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. This means that domestic titles find it very hard to retain readership. Among the best-selling Irish magazines are the &quot;RTÉ Guide&quot;, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Irish Tatler&quot;, &quot;VIP&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;In Dublin&quot;.

The first known radio transmission in Ireland was a call to arms made from the General Post Office in O&#x27;Connell Street during the Easter Rising. The first official radio station on the island was 2BE Belfast, which began broadcasting in 1924. This was followed in 1926 by 2RN Dublin and 6CK Cork in 1927. 2BE Belfast later became BBC Radio Ulster and 2RN Dublin became RTÉ. The first commercial radio station in the Republic, Century Radio, came on air in 1989.

During the 1990s and particularly the early 2000s, dozens of local radio stations have gained licences. This has resulted in a fragmentation of the radio broadcast market. This trend is most noticeable in Dublin where there are now 6 private licensed stations in operation.

=== Television ===

Different television stations are available depending on location in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland the main terrestrial television stations are the main UK wide channels BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Both the BBC and ITV have local regional programing specific to Northern Ireland produced and broadcast through BBC Northern Ireland and UTV.

In terms of Satellite-carried channels in Northern Ireland these are the same as for the rest of the United Kingdom including all Sky channels.

In the Republic of Ireland some areas first received signal from BBC Wales and then latter from BBC Northern Ireland when it began broadcasting television programmes in 1959 before RTÉ Television opened in 1961. Today the Republic&#x27;s main terrestrial channels are RTÉ One, RTÉ Two, TV3 which began broadcasting in 1998 and Teilifís na Gaeilge (TnaG), now called TG4 which started its Irish language service in 1996.

British and satellite-carried international television channels have widespread audiences in the Republic. The BBC and ITV families of channels are available free to air across the Republic and there is widespread availability of the four main UK channels (BBC1, BBC2, ITV1 and Channel Four) but only limited coverage from Five. Sky One, E4, and several hundred satellite channels are widely available. Parts of the Republic can access the UK digital TV system &quot;Freeview&quot;.

=== Film ===

The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s film industry has grown rapidly in recent years thanks largely to the promotion of the sector by &quot;Bord Scannán na hÉireann&quot; (The Irish Film Board) and the introduction of generous tax breaks. Some of the most successful Irish films included &quot;Intermission&quot; (2001), &quot;Man About Dog&quot; (2004), &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996), &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999), &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989), &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Commitments&quot; (1991). The most successful Irish film directors are Kenneth Branagh, Martin McDonagh, Neil Jordan, John Carney, and Jim Sheridan. Irish actors include Richard Harris, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Brenda Fricker, Michael Gambon, Colm Meaney, Gabriel Byrne, Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ciarán Hinds, James Nesbitt, Cillian Murphy, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Saoirse Ronan, Brendan Gleeson, Domhnall Gleeson, Michael Fassbender, Ruth Negga, Jamie Dornan and Colin Farrell.

Ireland has also proved a popular location for shooting films with &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004) and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; (2007) all being shot in Ireland.

== Cultural institutions, organisations and events ==

Ireland is well supplied with museums and art galleries and offers, especially during the summer months, a wide range of cultural events. These range from arts festivals to farming events. The most popular of these are the annual Dublin Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Festival which attracts on average 500,000 people and the National Ploughing Championships with an attendance in the region of 400,000. There are also a number of Summer Schools on topics from traditional music to literature and the arts.

<text>Sarikei is a town, and the capital of Sarikei District in Sarikei Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is located on the Rajang River, near where the river empties into the South China Sea. The district population (year 2010 census) was 56,798.

The most distinctive feature of the bustling waterfront is a 3.6-m-high pineapple statue and also the tallest building in Sarikei - Wisma Jubli Mutiara.

The town itself consists of a main road, Repok Road which is bisected by another road leading to the new development in Kampung Seberang which is known as Susur Jambu.

==Etymology==
There are many theories regarding the origin of the name of Sarikei. Once upon a time, Sarikei was the centre for buying and selling chickens and hence it was called &quot;Sa-rie-kei&quot; (&quot;Sa-rie&quot; in most Chinese dialects means &quot;centre&quot; and &quot;kei&quot; means &quot;street&quot;). Later the spelling was changed to Sarikei. Another explanation is that it comes from the name of a settlement named &quot;Sa-ley&quot; (沙厘) along Rajang River which later had a bazaar called &quot;Ba-sha&quot; (巴刹). The Cantonese people living there called the bazaar as &quot;Jie-shi&quot; or &quot;Shi-jie&quot; (街市 or 市街); and going to bazaar is known as &quot;Li-jie&quot; (里街). Thus when 沙里街 (Sa-li-jie) is romanised to English, it became &quot;Sarikei&quot;. Another theory stated that there was a stall selling red wood tile (红柴瓦) in the bazaar where the Cantonese people also called &quot;Sa-ley&quot; (沙厘), giving rise to the name of &quot;Sarikei&quot;. For the indigenous people living there, Sarikei is known as &quot;Siriki&quot;. Another theory was that Sarikei&quot; was named after a beautiful woman named &quot;Sareke&quot; who was married to the son (named &quot;Bujang&quot;) of a headman (named &quot;Sigalang&quot;) of the Sigalang community which existed since 300 years ago.

==History==

The town Sarikei already existed prior to the rule of Brooke when it was part of the Bruneian Empire. The Sigalang community is known to be the first community to exist in the Sarikei area 300 years ago which was located between Sarikei and Nyelong rivers where both rivers drained into the Rajang river. They were known to be skillful farmers, hunters, and house builders. The Sigalang community was named of its headman who was fair and just and took great care of the community. In the 1840s, the trade at Rajang River was controlled by Malays at Sarikei. Among the most powerful Malays was Datuk Patinggi Abdul Rahman. Among the popular items being traded at Sarikei was rice, beeswax, jungle produce, fine clothes and dried fish. Rajah James Brooke first visited Sarikei on 30 April 1845 in his steamer H.E.I.C.S. Phlegethon. In 1846, James Brooke wanted Abdul Rahman to control the piracy of the Iban people but Abdul Rahman failed to contain the Ibans. Rentap, an Iban freedom fighter against the Brookes from 1849 to 1861, was buried in the present day Bukit Sibau, Pakan District of the Sarikei Division. Syarif Masahor with his ally (the Iban people) attacked Abdul Rahman. He gained control of Sarikei from 1849. In 1851, (A.H.1267) Omar Ali Saifuddin II granted James Brooke the rights to control the Rajang River and its surrounding settlements. On 4 January 1856, Sarikei was burnt by Dayaks from Julau. In the same month, James Brooke set up a fort in Sarikei to suppress any piracy activities by the upriver Iban people. The fort was built for Brooke allies led by Abang Ali and Abang Asop. This has angered Syarif Masahor. Syarif responded by building a bigger military force. This led the Brookes to reinstate Syarif as the leader of Sarikei in September 1857 in exchange for Brooke&#x27;s control of Mukah. On 19 June 1856, Sir Charles Brooke led an expedition to Julau in order to counter the native resistance in Julau. The fort at Sarikei was burnt by Charles Johnson Brooke&#x27;s forces five years after 1856 when they tried to capture Syarif Masahor, Syarif&#x27;s rule ended in 1861. The administration of Sarikei was later taken over by the Brookes.

Hoklo people and the Cantonese people were the first ones to arrive in Sarikei in 1864. They built Attap dwellings and live alongside the Malays near the riverside. The Chinese rear chickens and planted vegetables. Later the Chinese used timber to build shophouses and started to do grocery businesses. After that, their businesses expanded to include trading with Singapore companies. The number of shophouses grew from four to six shops in 1905. In 1907, Fuzhounese migrants arrived Sarikei. As the population and the shophouses near the riverside increased, with several old shophouses tilting towards the riverside; the Brooke government ordered all the shophouses to migrate inland (now Repok road, also known as &quot;backstreet&quot;) for safety purposes. The road near the river is known as &quot;frontstreet&quot;. Most of the shophouses were family owned. River was the main mode of transport for Sarikei. Sarikei was connected to Singapore through a steamship that came once a month. As the shipping frequencies increased, warehouses and wharf was built. In 1923, the Chinese in Sarikei constructed the first part of Sarikei-Durin road. In 1932, all the wooden shophouses in Sarikei were rebuilt using concrete. Chinese schools started to increase from the same year. In 1941, Japanese troops occupied Sarawak. However, the Japanese did not take over the local government in Sibu. This created a power vacuum in the central region of Sarawak. This has caused chaos in Sarikei. The people in Sarikei had to form their own protection squad to deter piracy activities from the upriver Dayaks. Three months later, the Japanese formally installed a provincial governor at Sibu. Peace was restored but life became harder due to stagnated economic activities. By 1943, Sarikei had 40 concrete shops. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Sarawak was liberated and became British crown colony. In 1952, Cathay cinema was opened.

Initially, the Chinese were involved in land disputes with the local indigenous people. However, with Rajah intervention, boundaries between Chinese and indigenous people lands were drawn and both sides agreed to settle down in their own lands. In 1949, black pepper prices started to rise. Residents of Sarikei planted a large number of black pepper plantations. In 1950, the price of rubber rose due to the Korean War. This had caused a booming rubber plantation in Sarikei. Sarikei Chinese Chamber of Commerce was established in 1932 in order to protect Chinese commercial interests. In 1954, the Sarawak colonial government presented a 1955 budget deficit. In order to increase income, the colonial government decided to increase the price of business permit tax. In December 1954, the legislation to increase business permit tax was approved in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). This has caused the permit tax to increase from 500% to 900%. Sarikei Chinese chamber of Commerce decided to organise a strike for ten days in protest of increased taxes. The third division (today Sibu Division) Resident came to persuade the Chinese in Sarikei to stop the strike but to no avail. The strike proceed from 1 January 1955 to 10 January 1955. This strike received full support from Chinese merchants from Kuching, Sibu, Bintangor, and Selangau. Chinese merchants from Kapit strike for eight days while Miri, Bintulu, Mukah, and Saratok strike for three days. However, the strike failed to stop the business permit tax; and the taxation continues after the formation of Malaysia and is listed under the jurisdiction of Sarawak state government.

In the 1950s, Sarikei was a district under the jurisdiction of Sibu Division. In 1973, Sarikei was upgraded into the sixth division of Sarawak, covering 6,969 km2, consisting of Sarikei, Meradong, Julau, Matu, Daro, Balawai, and Pakan districts with a population of 151,300 people. The creation of Sarikei Division was to more effectively counter the communist insurgency in Sarawak. In 2002, the Sarawak government separated Matu, Daro, and Tanjung Manis districts from Sarikei to be incorporated into the newly created Mukah Division, thus leaving Sarikei Division with only Sarikei, Pakan, Meradong, and Julau districts, covering 4,857 km2 with a population of 117,837 people.

==Government==
Sarikei District Council was set up in January 1955. The council was tasked to administer the Sarikei district, public health, local sanitary system, public works, and fire rescue. Sarikei is also within the and (Kampung Seberang area) constituencies.

Christianity first set foot in Sarikei in the early 1900s with the establishment of churches and missionary schools.

Besides that, the town has a fairly large population of Christians. The majority of the Christians belong to the Methodist denomination which has about four churches in the town area and surrounding residential areas. The Roman Catholic parish of St Anthony&#x27;s in Sarikei has its church along Repok Road. The mission also runs two schools, St. Anthony&#x27;s Secondary School and St. Anne&#x27;s Primary School as well as a kindergarten, St. Clement&#x27;s.

==Economy==
Rubber and black pepper were the major agricultural products from Sarikei before the second world war. After the war, most of the Chinese shift their focus to black pepper cultivation. After the war, there was 12,000 acres of rubber plantations and 15,5000 acres of black pepper plantations. Before the war, monthly production of rubber was less than 3,000 picul and black pepper production was between 6,000 and 7,000 picul per year. After the war, the rate of black pepper production increased to more than 10,000 picul per year. Other businesses such as rice mills, rubber dyeing, grocery shops, exports, groceries, and drapery can also be found in the 1950s.

Today, Sarikei is known for its sweet and juicy pineapple production. Thus, Sarikei is also known as &quot;pineapple town&quot;. Sarikei has also become the main supplier of fruit, vegetables for Sarawak. Thus, the town is also nicknamed as the &quot;food basket&quot; of Sarawak. In the 1980s to 1990s, as the black pepper price increased to RM 1000 per 100 kg, more black pepper plantations were opened in Sarikei. As of 2010, the black pepper production in Sarikei accounted for two-thirds of tohe ttal black pepper production in Sarawak.

There is one light industrial estate in Sarikei that caters food processing, ceramic art, and handicrafts.

<text>Hanns Heinz Ewers (3 November 1871 – 12 June 1943) was a German actor, poet, philosopher, and writer of short stories and novels. While he wrote on a wide range of subjects, he is now known mainly for his works of horror, particularly his trilogy of novels about the adventures of Frank Braun, a character modeled on himself. The best known of these is &quot;Alraune&quot; (1911).

== Career ==

=== Early works ===
Born in Düsseldorf, Ewers started to write poetry when he was 17 years old. His first noticed poem was an obituary tribute to the German Emperor Frederick III.

Ewers earned his Abitur in March 1891. He then volunteered for the military and joined the &quot;Kaiser-Alexander-Gardegrenadier-Regiment Nr. 1&quot;, but was dismissed 44 days later because of myopia.

Ewers&#x27; literary career began with a volume of satiric verse, entitled &quot;A Book of Fables&quot;, published in 1901. That same year, he collaborated with Ernst von Wolzogen in forming a literary vaudeville theatre before forming his own such company, which toured Central and Eastern Europe before the operating expenses and constant interference from censors caused him to abandon the enterprise. A world traveler, Ewers was in South America at the beginning of World War I, and relocated to New York City, where he continued to write and publish.

Ewers&#x27; reputation as a successful German author and performer made him a natural speaker for the Imperial German cause to keep the United States from joining the war as an ally of Britain. Ewers toured cities with large ethnic German communities and raised funds for the German Red Cross.

During this period, he was involved with the &quot;Stegler Affair&quot;. American shipping companies sympathetic to the fight against Imperial Germany reportedly aided the British in identifying German-descended passengers traveling to Germany to volunteer for the Kaiser&#x27;s army. Many were arrested and interned in prison camps by the British Navy; eventually, German volunteers often required false passports to reach Europe unmolested. Ewers was implicated as a German agent by one of these ethnic Germans, Richard Stegler.

After the United States joined the war, he was arrested in 1918 as an &quot;active propagandist,&quot; as the US government, as well as British and French intelligence agencies, asserted that Ewers was a German agent. They evidenced his travels to Spain during 1915 and 1916, both with an alias using a falsified Swiss passport. Later, a travel report in the archives of the German Foreign Office was discovered indicating that he may have been traveling to Mexico, perhaps to encourage Pancho Villa to hamper the U.S. military by an attack on the United States.

Ewers is associated with the pro-German George Sylvester Viereck, son of the German immigrant and reported illegitimate Hohenzollern offspring Louis Sylvester Viereck (a Social Democrat famous for sharing a prison cell with August Bebel), who was a member of the same Berlin student corps (fraternity) as Ewers.

Ewers&#x27; activities as an &quot;Enemy Alien&quot; in New York were documented by J. Christoph Amberger in the German historical journal &quot;Einst &amp; Jetzt&quot; (1991). Amberger indicates arrival records which demonstrate that Ewers entered the United States in the company of a &quot;Grethe Ewers,&quot; who is identified as his wife. Enemy Alien Office records refer to a recent divorce. The identity of this otherwise undocumented wife has never been established, with reference to her missing from most biographies.

As a German national he was sent to the internment camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Ewers was never tried as a German agent in the United States. In 1921, he was released from the internment camp and returned to his native Germany.

=== Frank Braun trilogy ===
Ewers&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot; (&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;), was published in 1910, with an English translation published in America in 1927. It introduces the character of Frank Braun, who, like Ewers, is a writer, historian, philosopher, and world traveler with a decidedly Nietzschean morality. The story concerns Braun&#x27;s attempts to influence a small cult of Evangelical Christians in a small Italian mountain village for his own financial gain, and the horrific results which ensue.

This was followed in 1911 by &quot;Alraune&quot;, a reworking of the Frankenstein myth, in which Braun collaborates in creating a female homunculus or android by impregnating a prostitute with the semen from an executed murderer. The result is a young woman without morals, who commits numerous monstrous acts. &quot;Alraune&quot; was influenced by the ideas of the eugenics movement, especially the book &quot;Degeneration&quot; by Max Nordau. &quot;Alraune&quot; has been generally well received by historians of the horror genre; Mary Ellen Snodgrass describes &quot;Alraune&quot; as &quot;Ewers&#x27; decadent masterwork&quot;, Brian Stableford argues &quot;Alraune&quot; &quot;deserves recognition as the most extreme of all &quot;femme fatale&quot; stories&quot; and E. F. Bleiler states the scenes in &quot;Alraune&quot; set in the Berlin underworld as among the best parts of the novel. The novel was filmed several times, most recently in a German version with Erich von Stroheim in 1952.

Bleiler notes &quot;Both &quot;Alraune&quot; and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; are remarkable for the emotion the author can arouse&quot; and that Ewers&#x27; writing is, at its best, &quot;very effective&quot;. However, Bleiler also argues Ewers&#x27; work is marred by &quot;annoying pretentiousness, vulgarity, and a very obtrusive and unpleasant author&#x27;s personality&quot;.

The third novel of the sequence, &quot;Vampyr&quot;, written in 1921, concerns Braun&#x27;s own eventual transformation into a vampire, drinking the blood of his Jewish mistress.

=== Later works ===
Another novel, &quot;Der Geisterseher&quot; (The Ghost-Seer), Ewers&#x27; completion of the Friedrich Schiller novel, was published in 1922; Ewers&#x27; version was received badly.

Ewers also wrote the novel &quot;Reiter in deutscher Nacht&quot; (Riders in the German Night) published in 1932.

Ewers wrote numerous short stories, those in &quot;Nachtmahr&quot; (&quot;Nightmare&quot;) largely concern &quot;pornography, blood sport, torture
and execution&quot;. Stories translated into English include the often anthologised &quot;The Spider&quot; (1915), a tale of black magic based on the story &quot;The Invisible Eye&quot; by Erckmann-Chatrian; &quot;Blood&quot;, about knife fights to the death; and &quot;The Execution of Damiens&quot;, a story about the execution of the 18th-century French criminal Robert-François Damiens that achieved some notoriety for its violence.

Ewers also published several plays, poems, fairy tales, opera librettos, and critical essays. These included &quot;Die Ameisen&quot;, translated into English as &quot;The Ant People&quot;, &quot;Indien und ich&quot;, a travelogue of his time in India, and a 1916 critical essay on Edgar Allan Poe, to whom he has often been compared. Indeed, Ewers is still considered by some as a major author in the evolution of the horror literary genre, cited as an influence by American horror writers such as H. P. Lovecraft and
Guy Endore. Students of the occult are also attracted to his works, due to his longtime friendship and correspondence with Aleister Crowley. Ewers also translated several French writers into German, including Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam.

Ewers also edited the eight-volume &quot;Galerie der Phantasten&quot; anthologies of horror and fantasy literature,
featuring work by Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, Oskar Panizza, Honoré de Balzac, Alfred Kubin, Ewers&#x27;
friend Karl Hans Strobl, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer and Ewers himself.

During the time Ewers was writing his major horror stories, he was also giving lectures (between 1910 and 1925) on the topic &quot;Die Religion des Satan&quot; (&quot;The Religion of Satan&quot;), inspired by Stanisław Przybyszewski&#x27;s 1897 German book &quot;Die Synagoge des Satan&quot; (&quot;The Synagogue of Satan&quot;).

He died on June 12, 1943, in his Berlin apartment. His ashes were buried on October 15 of the same year in the Düsseldorf North Cemetery (Nordfriedhof, Field Nr. 78, 55235-WE).

== Movie work ==
Ewers was one of the first critics to recognize cinema as a legitimate art form, and wrote the scripts for numerous early examples of the medium, most notably &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; (1913), a reworking of the Faust legend which also included the first portrayal of a double role by an actor on the screen.

Nazi martyr Horst Wessel, then a member of the same corps (student fraternity) of which Ewers had been a member, acts as an extra in a 1926 version of the movie, also written by Ewers. Ewers was later commissioned by Adolf Hitler to write a biography of Wessel (&quot;Horst Wessel- ein deutsches Schicksal&quot;), which also was made into a movie.

== Nazi involvement ==
During the last years of the Weimar Republic, Ewers became involved with the burgeoning Nazi Party, attracted by its nationalism, its Nietzschean moral philosophy, and its cult of Teutonic culture, and joined the NSDAP in 1931. He did not agree with the party&#x27;s anti-Semitism (his character Frank Braun has a Jewish mistress, Lotte Levi, who is also a patriotic German) and this and his homosexual tendencies soon ended his welcome with party leaders. In 1934 most of his works were banned in Germany, and his assets and property seized. Alfred Rosenberg was his main adversary in the party, but after submitting many petitions Ewers eventually secured the rescission of the ban. His last book &quot;Die schönsten Hände der Welt&quot; (&quot;The most beautiful hands in the world&quot;) was published by the Zinnen Verlag (Munich, Vienna, Leipzig) in 1943. Ewers died from tuberculosis in the same year.

Despite his great influence on 20th century fantasy and horror literature, Ewers remains out of favor in bourgeois literary circles (especially in the English-speaking world and Germany) because of his association with the Nazis. As a result, post-World War II editions of his works are often difficult to find, and earlier editions can command a premium price from collectors.

== Twenty-first-century translations ==
&quot;Blood&quot; is a chapbook collection published in 1977 by Valcour and Krueger (San Diego, CA). It contains three stories: &quot;The Mamaloi,&quot; &quot;The White Maiden,&quot; and &quot;Tomato Sauce.&quot;

In March 2009, Side Real Press issued an English language collection of short stories including some newly translated material. This was followed by a new uncensored translation of &quot;Alraune&quot; translated by Joe Bandel which sold out after one year. The Alraune Centennial Edition by Bandel Books Online was released in March 2011. The centennial edition translated by Joe Bandel contains an essay by Dr. Wilfried Kugel, noted Ewers biographer.

&quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, The First Volume in the Frank Braun trilogy was translated by Joe Bandel and published by Bandel Books Online in September 2012. This is the first uncensored English translation of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. It includes an Introduction by Dr. Wilfried Kugel; the poems, &quot;Prometheus&quot; by Goethe, and &quot;Hymn to Satan&quot; by Carducci; &quot;The Satanism of Hanns Heinz Ewers&quot;, &quot;Duality-The Male&quot;, &quot;Duality-The Female&quot;, and &quot;Duality-Sexual Alchemy&quot; by Joe Bandel and the complete text of &quot;Synagogue of Satan&quot; by Stanisław Przybyszewski also translated by Joe Bandel.

In 2016 Ajna Offensive published Markus Wolff&#x27;s English translation of Ewers&#x27; 1922 novel &quot;Die Herzen der Könige&quot; (The Hearts of Kings).

==In popular culture==
Ewers appears in Kim Newman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot;, as a predatory vampire who travels briefly with Edgar Allan Poe.

<doc id="991321" wikidata="Q3633313" url="?curid=991321" title="Birla Corporation">
<text>Birla Corporation Limited is an Indian-based company of the M.P Birla Group, founded by Ghanshyam Das Birla in the late 1910s and carried on by Madhav Prasad Birla.

In the 1890s, Birla Corporation was a jute manufacturing company, but over time, it grew to operate four main divisions: cement, jute, linoleum, and auto trim. It is not a part of the Aditya Birla Group, a multinational conglomerate with products ranging from metals, cements, textiles, agricultural businesses, telecommunications, IT, and financial services. Formerly known as Birla Jute Manufacturing Company Limited, with the expansion of divisions, the company changed their name in 1998 to Birla Corporation Limited.

==History==

===Before Birla Corporation Ltd.===

Ghanshyam Das Birla’s grandfather, Shiv Narayana Birla, used his capital from a moneylending business and started a cotton business. With a successful venture, he went back to Pilani, his birthplace, and built a mansion for the family. Business boomed with World War I as the British Empire relied on Birla to provide for the war efforts. GD Birla inherited the family business and expanded into many industries, and by 1919, the Birla Brothers Limited was formed with his other three siblings. He ventured into the motor vehicle industry, tea, textiles, cement, chemicals, and by 1942, also organized the United Commercial Bank Limited, one of the first commercial banks of India. While still in the early years of the Birla Group, an inkling of the future of Birla Brothers Limited was depicted in GD Birla’s life.

===Founding of Birla Corporation Ltd.===

Born in 1918, Madhav Prasad of Bombay, son of RD Birla, was a part of the Birla Jute Manufacturing Company since the beginning. By the time he finished college, he was already in charge of Birla Jute which had suffered economic downturns and wars. Madhav changed the company from Birla Jute Manufacturing Company to a company with activities across a wide spectrum of industries. In MP Birla’s time, Birla Corporation and the other businesses under Birla Group gained significant power and stance in the cement, auto trims, steel, and building materials. When he died in 1990, his wife, Priyamvada Birla took over as the chairman of Birla in 1998 and changed the name to Birla Corporation Limited. Priyamvada was known for her active roles in the community, healthcare, and education.

==Businesses==
*Birla Jute Supply Company Ltd - Operates in manufacturing and trading of jute products, focusing on sustainable packaging solutions.
*Budge Budge Floorcoverings Ltd - Specializes in manufacturing and exporting eco-friendly jute floor coverings, rugs, and home décor products.
*Hindustan Gums &amp; Chemicals Ltd - Produces guar gum and derivatives, catering to industries like food, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and oil drilling.
*Lok Cements Ltd - Focuses on manufacturing and distributing high-quality cement products for construction and infrastructure projects.
*RCCPL Pvt Ltd - Manufactures and markets premium-grade cement for construction and infrastructure projects.

===Recent Events===

In 2013, Birla Corporation merged with its subsidiary company, Talavadi Cements Ltd as the firm could not meet requirements for raw materials due to a ban on the mines in Rajasthan. This caused a decrease in the Birla stock around the months of June and July.

==Problems==

===Birla vs Lodha dispute===

When Priyamvada died in 2004, she gave the Rs 5000 crore estate to her close accountant, Rajendra Singh Lodha, who was a co-chairman. Lodha eventually became chairman of Birla Corporation. This estate included key holdings in the East India Investments Co and Gwalior Webbing, Birla Corporation, Vidhya Telelinks, and Universal cables, among others. However, the Birla family challenged the Lodha family in court in 2008 about the contents of the will, and Priyamvada’s previous two wills. The case changed course with the sudden death of RS Lodha in October 2008. In her will, Priyamvada declared that after RS Lodha, his son, Harsh Lodha would inherit the estates. Since the will was written in 1999 and was not officially granted &quot;probate,&quot; the Lodha family currently holds the MP Birla group.

=== Cement in 2011 ===
In 2011, Birla Corporation faced problems with overproduction of cement during a long period of decreasing demand. Naturally, Harsh Lodha became worried for the corporation since cement is the largest revenue generator for Birla Corp. He is currently looking into other alternatives for growth in the coal industry. Meanwhile, Birla Corporation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Assam Mineral Development for a cement plant in Assam where Birla will invest Rs 2500 crores over a time span of three years. In November 2017 it was announced that &quot;M.P Birla Cement&quot; had agreed to become the co-sponsor Mohun Bagan A.C for the period between December 2019.

===Harsh Lodha indicted===

Harsh Lodha and his brother, Aditya Lodha, were indicted in 2013 for malpractice. Three members of the Birla Corporation, Om Prakash Agarwal, Suresh Kumar Sharma, and Shashi Agarwal claimed there was malpractice in the firm and alleged misconduct in falsifying the information about the number of partners in the firm. This was a problem as Aditya Lodha had a part in the Chartered Accountant firm Lodha and Company. His brother, Harsh, was the chairman of Birla Corporation. At the time, Lodha and Company was the auditor of Birla Corporations. As a result, the ICAI suspended Harsh and Aditya Lodha for 3 months.

=== Removal and reinstatement of Harsh Vardhan Lodha ===
On 19 September 2020, the Calcutta High Court ordered the removal of Harsh Vardhan Lodha from all the directorships and other positions in the trust&#x27;s and societies of the MP Birla Group of Companies.

In July 2021, The Supreme Court ruled that Harsh Vardhan Lodha can continue as director and chairman in Birla Corporation, Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cable. However the company has been a part of major controversies since the reinstatement of Harsh Vardhan Lodha.

==Philanthropy== 
===Healthcare===

Birla Corporation is a supporter of health, education, and social welfare under the MP Birla Group. Priyamvada Birla showed an interest in health care, helping to build hospitals and funding research ranging from eye health to cardiology, oncology, neurology, and orthopedics. She also founded the Priyamvada Birla Cancer Research Institute and joined with Aravind Eye Care Center to build the Priyamvada Birla Aravind Eye Hospital. After the death of Priyamvada Birla, the healthcare units like hospitals and research centres under her leadership have reached a stagnant phase with no major improvements in research and development factor. Medical students train at these hospitals.

===Education===

The MP Birla Foundation built many schools in India. These schools include institutions, industrial training in computers, mechanical and electrical studies, a Sanskrit school for students interested in Vedic studies. They also cater to children of employees at Birla with an education taught in Hindi and financial aid for students.

<doc id="991335" wikidata="Q2718629" url="?curid=991335" title="Pica (typography)">
<text>The pica is a typographic unit of measure corresponding to approximately of an inch, or from to of a foot. One pica is further divided into 12 points.

In printing, three pica measures are used:

* The French pica of 12 Didot points (also called cicero) generally is: 12 × 0.376 = .
* The American pica of . It was established by the United States Type Founders&#x27; Association in 1886. In TeX one pica is of an inch.
* The contemporary computer PostScript pica is exactly of an inch or of a foot, i.e. 4.2 mm or 0.1 in.

Publishing applications such as Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress represent pica measurements with whole-number picas left of a lower-case &quot;p&quot;, followed by the points number, for example: 5p6 represents 5 picas and 6 points, or 5 picas.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) defined by the World Wide Web Consortium use pc as the abbreviation for pica ( of an inch), and pt for point ( of an inch).

The pica is also used in measuring the font capacity and is applied in the process of copyfitting. The font length is measured there by the number of &quot;characters per pica&quot; (cpp). As books are most often printed with proportional fonts, cpp of a given font is usually a fractional number. For example, an 11-point font (like Helvetica) may have 2.4 cpp, thus a 5-inch (30-pica) line of a usual octavo-sized (6×8 in) book page would contain around 72 characters (including spaces). 

There have existed copyfitting tables for a number of typefaces, and typefoundries often provided the number of characters per pica for each type in their specimen catalogs. Similar tables exist as well with which one can estimate the number of characters per pica knowing the lower-case alphabet length.

The typographic pica should not be confused with the &quot;Pica&quot; font of the typewriters, which means a font where 10 typed characters make up a line one inch long.

<doc id="991337" wikidata="Q1690954" url="?curid=991337" title="Job enrichment">
<text>Job enrichment is a method of motivating employees where a job is designed to have interesting and challenging tasks which can require more skill and can increase pay.

== Origin ==
Frederick Herzberg, an American psychologist, originally developed the concept of &#x27;job enrichment&#x27; in 1968, in an article that he published on pioneering studies at AT&amp;T. The concept stemmed from Herzberg&#x27;s motivator-hygiene theory, which is based on the premise that job attitude is a construct of two independent factors, namely job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction. Job satisfaction encompasses intrinsic factors which arise from the work itself, including achievement and advancement, whilst job dissatisfaction stems from factors external to the actual work, including company policy and the quality of supervision.

He came up with this term while he was working on his &quot;two factor theory&quot; which states that both satisfaction (e.g. job satisfaction) and dissatisfaction are driven by separate factors that are completely independent of each other. To this effect he implies that just because an individual experiences a decrease in dissatisfaction, does not mean that the result is also an increase in satisfaction.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
*&quot;Learn new skills&quot;: By having more responsibilities, the employee will have the chance to work on new tasks and therefore learn new skills. Decision making can lead to the employee to think, decide, and try new things. By having to learn new skills, the employee has the opportunity to become proficient at certain tasks and even become experts.
*&quot;Reduce boredom&quot;: Job enrichment focuses on giving employees more variety and responsibilities. The target of job enrichment is to reduce the chance of boredom from the repetitive, tedious activities. 
*&quot;Creates a better work environment&quot;: The net result of job enrichment is an overall more positive environment that promotes maximum productivity. This is simply because employees who are treated better tend to have better attitudes around the work place and tend to spread that positivism around the office.
*Employees can be free and motivated during workplace.

===Disadvantages===
*&quot;Lack of preparation&quot;: Because employees are given more activities and responsibilities in job enrichment, they do not necessarily have the right skills or experience for the job. Because the employee is not prepared or trained enough to do the activity, then they may not be as efficient as someone who is already trained or skilled in that particular activity. As a result, they may have a lower productivity rate.
*&quot;Heavier workload&quot;: Job enrichment increases the employee&#x27;s overall workload. This requires skill in reprioritization for the employee. Some employees may not be able to quickly adjust to their new responsibilities. Employees may feel overloaded and tired, so they may have a lower productivity rate.
*&quot;Clash with non-participants&quot;: Understandably, not every employee at a company can participate in job enrichment. Those who cannot join may feel disconnected from the company and not part of the team. The employees who cannot join may even feel jealous towards participants.
*&quot;Poor performance&quot;: As a result of lack of preparation and heavier workload, some employees may not perform as efficient as prior to job enrichment. These employees may actually work better in a non job-enriching environment. By not doing as well as desired, they may feel inept. Their poor performance may lead to demotions, which tends to have a negative impact on the employee&#x27;s self –confidence and motivation.

== Techniques ==
Job enrichment, as a managerial activity, includes a three-step technique:

#Turn employees&#x27; effort into performance:
#* Ensuring that objectives are well-defined and understood by everyone. The overall corporate mission statement should be communicated to all. Individuals&#x27; goals should also be clear: each employee should know exactly how he/she fits into the overall process and be aware of how important their contribution is to the organization and its customers.
#* Providing adequate resources for each employee to perform well. This includes support functions like information technology, communication technology, and personnel training and development.
#* Creating a supportive corporate culture. This includes peer support networks, supportive management, and removing elements that foster mistrust and politicking.
#* Free flow of information. Eliminate secrecy.
#* Provide enough freedom to facilitate job excellence. Encourage and reward employee initiative. Flextime or compressed hours could be offered.
#* Provide adequate recognition, appreciation, and other motivators.
#* Provide skill improvement opportunities. This could include paid education at universities or on the job training.

== Versus job enlargement ==
Job enrichment can be contrasted to job enlargement which simply increases the number of tasks without changing the challenge. Job enrichment is seen as a vertical job restructuring technique where the focus is on giving the employee more authority, independence, and control over the manner the activity is completed. On the other hand, job enlargement is seen as a horizontal restructuring technique where the focus is merely increasing the number of assignments but does not change the overall authority, autonomy, and control of the projects. Job enlargements impact on the work environment is not always the most positive due to the fact that it is largely just an increase in work for the employee and not really a step up in responsibility. Job enrichment on the other hand is a very motivational technique in the management world. The act of enriching an employee&#x27;s job not only is a sign of respect but it also shows that the employer actually cares about the employee as a person. This creates a desire for the employee to want to pay the employer back in the form of hard work, loyalty, and dedication the company.

<text>Centrex is a portmanteau of central exchange, a kind of telephone exchange. It provides functions similar to a PBX, but is provisioned with equipment owned by, and located at, the telephone company premises.

Centrex service was first installed in the early 1960s in New York&#x27;s financial district by New York Telephone. As of 2003, it was estimated that there were 20 million Centrex lines installed worldwide by 20 telephone companies, with the most installations in the United States (15 million), Canada (2 million), and the United Kingdom (1 million). This accounted for approximately 5% of all installed business telephone lines, worldwide.

In terms of user-visible features, Centrex and PBX are similar. Features include:

* Direct inward dialing (DID)
* Automatic routing of calls to obtain lowest cost
* Call pick-up groups
* Call forwarding
* Conference calling
* Automatic call distribution (ACD)
* Call detail recording

==Phasing out==
In the United States, the usage of Centrex lines has fallen from 16.5 million in 2002 to 10.7 million in 2008 as users transition to IP-PBX (through VoIP). Centrex continues to be used by large institutions, government agencies, and universities as most of the equipment has already been paid for, though leasing Centrex lines may be more expensive.

<text>The Philippine Congressional Medal was a service medal of the United States Army which was established by the United States Congress on 9 July 1906. The medal recognized those soldiers who had enlisted in the United States Army for the purpose of the serving in the Philippine–American War.

==Criteria==
The four primary criteria, to be awarded the Philippine Congressional Medal, were as follows:
* Enlisted between 21 April and 26 October 1898
* Served beyond 11 April 1899
* Served in the Philippines after 6 July 1899
* Received an honorable discharge (or died prior to being discharged)

The medal was different from the Philippine Campaign Medal in that the Philippine Campaign Medal recognized general service in the Philippines while the Philippine Congressional Medal was intended for special services rendered.

The Philippine Congressional Medal was considered an authorized military decoration, but soon became regarded as a commemorative medal since it recognized a single event and also was not eligible for presentation to the United States Navy and Marine Corps.

==Appearance==
The Philippine Congressional Medal is 1 1/4 inches in diameter made of bronze with an oxidized and relieved finish. The obverse of the medal depicts a color guard of one flag bearer accompanied by two soldiers bearing rifles, marching toward the left of the medal. Around the edge of the medal are the words &quot;PHILIPPINE INSURRECTION&quot;. In the exergue is the date 1899. The reverse bears the inscription &quot;FOR PATRIOTISM FORTITUDE AND LOYALTY&quot; surrounded by a wreath of pine branches on the left and palms on the right, tied at the bottom with a bow. The suspension and service ribbons are ultramarine blue with edge stripes of red and white. The outside white stripes are 1/16 of an inch from the edge and 1/16 inches wide. The inside stripes of old glory red and white are 1/8 inches wide.

<doc id="991349" wikidata="Q156389" url="?curid=991349" title="Point (typography)">
<text>In typography, the point is the smallest unit of measure. It is used for measuring font size, leading, and other items on a printed page. The size of the point has varied throughout printing&#x27;s history. Since the 18th century, the size of a point has been between 0.18 and 0.4 millimeters. Following the advent of desktop publishing in the 1980s and 1990s, digital printing has largely supplanted the letterpress printing and has established the desktop publishing (DTP) point as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard. The DTP point is defined as of an inch (or exactly 0.352 mm) and, as with earlier American point sizes, is considered to be of a pica.

In metal type, the point size of a font describes the height of the metal body on which that font&#x27;s characters were cast. In digital type, letters of a computer font are designed around an imaginary space called an &quot;em square&quot;. When a point size of a font is specified, the font is scaled so that its em square has a side length of that particular length in points. Although the letters of a font usually fit within the font&#x27;s em square, there is not necessarily any size relationship between the two, so the point size does not necessarily correspond to any measurement of the size of the letters on the printed page.

== History ==
The point was first established by the Milanese typographer, Francesco Torniella da Novara ( – 1589) in his 1517 alphabet, &quot;L&#x27;Alfabeto&quot;. The construction of the alphabet is the first based on logical measurement called &quot;Punto,&quot; which corresponds to the ninth part of the height of the letters or the thickness of the principal stroke.

==Notations==
A measurement in points can be represented in three different ways. For example, 14 points (1 pica plus 2 points) can be written:

* (12 points would be just &quot;&quot;)—traditional style
* 1p2 (12 points would be just &quot;1p&quot;)—format for desktop
* 14pt (12 points would be &quot;12pt&quot; or &quot;1pc&quot; since it is the same as 1 pica)—format used by Cascading Style Sheets defined by the World Wide Web Consortium.

== Varying standards ==

There have been many definitions of a &quot;point&quot; since the advent of typography. Traditional continental European points at about are usually a bit larger than English points at around .

=== French points ===

The Truchet point, the first modern typographic point, was of a French inch or of the royal foot. It was invented by the French clergyman Sébastien Truchet. 
During the metrication of France amid its revolution, a 1799 law declared the meter to be exactly 443.296 French lines long. This established a length to the royal foot of  m or about 325 mm. 
The Truchet point therefore became equal to  mm or about . 
It has also been cited as exactly 0.188 mm.
The Fournier point was established by Pierre Simon Fournier in 1737. The system of Fournier was based on a different French foot of c. 298 mm. With the usual convention that 1 foot equals 12 inches, 1 inch (&quot;pouce&quot;) was divided into 12 lines (&quot;lignes&quot;) and 1 line was further divided into 6 typographic points (&quot;points typographiques&quot;). One Fournier point is about 0.0135 English inches.

Fournier printed a reference scale of 144 points over two inches; however, it was too rough to accurately measure a single point.

The Fournier point did not achieve lasting popularity despite being revived by the Monotype Corporation in 1927. It was still a standard in Belgium, in parts of Austria, and in Northern France at the beginning of the 20th century. In Belgium, the Fournier system was used until the 1970s and later. It was called the &quot;mediaan&quot;-system. 
The Didot point, established by François-Ambroise Didot in 1783, was an attempt to improve the Fournier system. He did not change the subdivisions (1 inch = 12 subdivisions = 72 points), but defined it strictly in terms of the royal foot, a legal length measure in France: the Didot point is exactly of a French foot or of a French inch, that is (by 1799)  mm or about . Accordingly, one Didot point is exactly two Truchet points.

However, 12 Fournier points turned out to be 11 Didot points, giving a Fournier point of about ; later sources state it as being . To avoid confusion between the new and the old sizes, Didot also rejected the traditional names, thus &quot;parisienne&quot; became &quot;corps&quot; 5, &quot;nonpareille&quot; became &quot;corps&quot; 6, and so on. The Didot system prevailed because the French government demanded printing in Didot measurements.

Approximations were subsequently employed, largely owing to the Didot point&#x27;s unwieldy conversion to metric units (the divisor of its conversion ratio has the prime factorization of ).

In 1878, Hermann Berthold defined 798 points as being equal to 30 cm, or 2660 points equalling 1 meter: that gives around to the point. A more precise number, , sometimes is given; this is used by TeX as the unit. This has become the standard in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe. This size is still mentioned in the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.

=== Metric points ===
pdfTEX, but not plain TeX or LaTeX, also supports a &quot;new Didot point&quot; (&quot;nd&quot;) at  mm or and refers to a not further specified 1978 redefinition for it.
The French National Print Office adopted a point of  mm or in about 1810 and continues to use this measurement today (though &quot;recalibrated&quot; to ).
Japanese and German standardization bodies instead opted for a metric typographic base measure of exactly  mm or , which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;quart&quot; in Japan. The symbol &quot;Q&quot; is used in Japanese after the initial letter of &quot;quarter millimeter&quot;. Due to demand by Japanese typesetters, CSS adopted &quot;Q&quot; in 2015.

ISO 128 specifies preferred line thicknesses for technical drawings and ISO 9175 specifies respective pens. The steps between nominal sizes are based on a factor of √2 ≈ 1.414 in order to match ISO 216 paper sizes. Since the set of sizes includes thicknesses of 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm, there is also one of 0.35 mm which is almost exactly 1 pica point. In other words, 2−1.5 mm = mm approximates an English typographic point rather well.

=== American points ===
The basic unit of measurements in American typography was the pica, usually approximated as one sixth of an inch, but the exact size was not standardized, and various type foundries had been using their own.

During and after the American Revolutionary War, Benjamin Franklin was sent as commissioner (Ambassador) for the United States to France from December 1776 to 1785. While living there he had close contact with the Fournier family, including the father and Pierre Simon Fournier. Franklin wanted to teach his grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache about printing and typefounding, and arranged for him to be trained by Francois Ambroise Didot. Franklin then imported French typefounding equipment to Philadelphia to help Bache set up a type-foundry. Around 1790, Bache published a specimen sheet with some Fournier types. After the death of Franklin, the matrices and the Fournier mould were acquired by Binny and Ronaldson, the first permanent type-foundry in America. Successive mergers and acquisitions in 1833, 1860 and 1897 saw the company eventually become known as MacKellar, Smith &amp; Jordan. The Fournier cicero mould was used by them to cast pica-sized type.
Nelson Hawks proposed, like Fournier, to divide one American inch exactly into six picas, and one pica into 12 points. However, this saw an opposition because the majority of foundries had been using picas less than one sixth of an inch. So in 1886, after some examination of various picas, the Type Founders Association of the United States approved the pica of the L. Johnson &amp; Co. foundry of Philadelphia (the &quot;Johnson pica&quot;) as the most established. The Johnson foundry was influential, being America&#x27;s first and oldest foundry; established as Binny &amp; Ronaldson in 1796, it would go through several names before being the largest of the 23 foundries that would merge in 1892 to form the American Type Founders Co. The official definition of one pica is , and one point is . That means 6 picas or 72 points constitute standard inches. A less precise definition is one pica equals , and one point . It was also noticed that 83 picas is nearly equal to 35 cm, so the Type Founders Association also suggested using a 35 cm metal rod for measurements, but this was not accepted by every foundry.

This has become known as the American point system. The British foundries accepted this in 1898.

In modern times this size of the point has been approximated as exactly () of the inch by Donald Knuth for the default unit of his TeX computer typesetting system and is thus sometimes known as the , which is 0. mm.

===Old English points===
Although the English Monotype manuals used 1 pica = , their manuals used on the European continent use another definition. There, 1 pica = , the Old English pica. As a consequence all the tables of measurements in the German, Dutch, French, Polish and all other manuals elsewhere on the European continent for the composition caster and the super-caster are different in quite some details. The Monotype wedges used at the European continent are marked with an extra &#x27;E&#x27; behind the set-size: for instance: 5-12E, 1331-15E etc. When working with the E-wedges in the larger sizes, the differences will increase even more.

=== Desktop publishing point ===

The desktop publishing point (DTP point) or PostScript point is defined as or 0.013 of an inch, making it equivalent to  mm = 0.352 mm. Twelve points make up a pica, and six picas make an inch.

This specification was found in the Xerox Interpress language used for its early digital printers and further developed by John Warnock and Charles Geschke when they created Adobe PostScript. It was adopted by Apple Computer as the standard for the display resolution of the original Macintosh desktop computer and the print resolution for the LaserWriter printer.

In 1996, it was adopted by W3C for Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) where it was later related at a fixed 3:4 ratio to the pixel due to a general (but wrong) assumption of 96 pixel-per-inch screens.

=== Apple point ===

Since the advent of high-density &quot;Retina&quot; screens with a much higher resolution than the original 72 dots per inch, Apple&#x27;s programming environment Xcode sizes GUI elements in &quot;points&quot; that are scaled automatically to a whole number of physical pixels in order to accommodate for screen size, pixel density and typical viewing distance. This &quot;Cocoa point&quot; is equivalent to the &quot;pixel&quot; codice_1 unit in CSS, the &quot;density-independent pixel&quot; codice_2 on Android and the &quot;effective pixel&quot; codice_3 or codice_4 in Windows UWP.

== Font sizes ==
In lead typecasting, most font sizes commonly used in printing have conventional names that differ by country, language and the type of points used.

Desktop publishing software and word processors intended for office and personal use often have a list of suggested font sizes in their user interface, but they are not named and usually an arbitrary value can be entered manually. Microsoft Word, for instance, suggests every even size between 8 and 28 points and, additionally, 9, 11, 36, 48 and 72 points (the font sizes 36, 48 and 72 equal 3, 4 and 6 picas respectively). While most software nowadays defaults to DTP points, many allow specifying font size in other units of measure (e.g., inches, millimeters, pixels), especially code-based systems such as TeX and CSS.

<text>John Bevis (10 November 1695 – 6 November 1771) was an English medical doctor, electrical researcher and astronomer. He is best known for discovering the Crab Nebula in 1731. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, being awarded his B.A. in 1715 and his M.A. in 1718.

In 1757 Bevis published in London a volume on &quot;The History and Philosophy of Earthquakes&quot; in which he collected accounts of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake from diverse authentic sources. His survey, the first of its kind, was subsequently used by John Michell (1761).

In 1757 Bevis was asked by the tobacconist Thomas Hughes to discover why no flowers would grow in his garden at Bagnigge House, which stood in the vicinity of 61–63 King&#x27;s Cross Road, London. He found the water from the well on the site to be full of iron. On this research, a second well was dug, the water from which was found to be a good purgative. This led to the establishment of one of the most popular 18th-century spas, Bagnigge Wells, the following year. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November, 1765.

==Electrical research==
When the Leyden jar first arrived in the UK (1746), Bevis worked with William Watson in refining it. They removed the water and replaced it with lead shot, then later lined the inside and exterior of the glass with lead. They also experimented to determine the speed of electricity using nearly four kilometers of wire and observing the spark made on entering the wire, and that made on leaving it: they could not detect any time delay and concluded it must be almost instantaneous.

Watson and Bevis corresponded extensively with Benjamin Franklin and his group of Philadelphia experimenters and they jointly: refined the Leyden jar by coating the inside and outside with tin foil; joined Leyden jars together to create a &quot;battery&quot;; distinguished between the charge in Leyden jars linked in series from those linked in parallel; created a flat glass-plate and tin-foil version of the Jar battery (the first flat-plate condensor); developed the single-fluid theory of electricity which emphasised a superabundance of the fluid on one side, and a deficit on the other; introduced the concept of positive and negative charges.

==Astronomer==
Besides discovering the Crab Nebula (M1, when it got listed decades later in Messier&#x27;s catalogue), Bevis also observed an occultation by Venus of Mercury on 28 May 1737 NS, (17 May 1737 OS) and observed and found a prediction rule for eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s moons.

Besides discovering the Crab Nebula, Bevis is known for his proposal to compile a modern British star atlas, &quot;Uranographia Britannica&quot;. The first mention was in an advertisement in the &quot;Northampton Mercury&quot; of 11 April 1748 notifying that subscribers could obtain copies of the atlas when finished.

&quot;Uranographia&quot; was based on Flamsteed&#x27;s star positions, published posthumously in 1725 as &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot;, a catalogue of 2,935 stars, together with additional stars from Bevis’s own observations made between 1738 and 1739 from Stoke Newington. In 1731, Bevis had been the first to notice what we now call the Crab Nebula (Messier 1). &quot;Uranographia Britannica&quot; was the first of the &quot;classical&quot; star atlases to include non-stellar objects.

In 1750, as the atlas was still in the process of being compiled, Bevis&#x27;s publisher, John Neale was declared bankrupt, the copper plates sequestered by the London Courts of Chancery and the project terminated. Uranographia Britannica was never published. In 1785, long after the death of Neale and of Bevis, Bevis&#x27;s library was auctioned by the widow of his executor, James Horsfall F.R.S. According to the auction catalogue, three near-complete atlases were sold together with an unknown number of star charts that were later compiled into an unknown number of atlases and offered for sale anonymously in 1786 as &quot;Atlas Celeste&quot;, essentially to use up the existing stock of pre-printed star charts. It is this atlas which forms the bulk of the currently identified Bevis atlases but unlike &quot;Uranographia Britannica&quot; that Bevis intended to have explanatory notes and catalogues, &quot;Atlas Celeste&quot; does not.

Of the three, nearly-finished, &quot;Uranographia Britannica&quot;, one was bought at the Sotheby &amp; Wilkinson sale, London, 21 January 1856, by the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. This APS copy is the atlas on which Ashworth based his 1981 seminal description. Another is at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In poor condition and dirty, it is not as complete as the APS atlas. The third and last atlas sold at auction in 1785 was identified in November 2011 [by Kilburn] in the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s Collection at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire. In good condition it is second only to the APS atlas, having fewer descriptive notes to accompany the star charts.

All three copies of Bevis’s intended Uranographia have now been identified. We also know the whereabouts [2022] of twenty-seven of the twenty-nine described copies of Atlas Celeste; most are in the UK or USA. Two are missing, presumed to be in private collections. Examination of currently known Atlas Celestes that do not have the intended full set of 51 star charts suggests that the compiler was running out of them. Other than that at Lund University library, Sweden, none has yet been identified elsewhere in continental Europe. There are two copies in Australia.

The Manchester Astronomical Society (U.K.; an amateur society) has a website for the Bevis star charts at https://www.manastro.org/bevis.html. Member Kevin Kilburn keeps an updated list of bound and unbound Bevis plates and atlases at: https://www.manastro.org/bevis/IDENTIFIED_Uranographia_sets_SEPTEMBER_2020.pdf

==Personal life==
Bevis died in 1771 as a result of falling off his telescope.

He was an acquaintance of Thomas Paine when living at the Temple.

<text>Donald Earl &quot;Slick&quot; Watts (born July 22, 1951) is an American former basketball player who was the first NBA player to lead the league in both assists and steals in 1976.

==College==
&quot;Slick&quot; Watts originally attended Grand View Junior College but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in 1970, where he played college basketball for three years under coach Bob Hopkins, and alongside his teammate, future ABA and NBA star Bruce Seals.

For the 1972 season, Watts and Seals led the Gold Rush to its first NAIA District 30 Men&#x27;s Basketball championship defeating Nicholls State University 85–83, before losing to Westmont in the 1972 NAIA basketball tournament semi-finals 71–59.

During his final season, Watts led the Gold Rush to their second consecutive NAIA District 30 Championship, defeating Dillard University 101–80. In the 1973 NAIA basketball tournament Watts and his teammates upset Sam Houston State University, 67–60, in the second round. At the time, the Bearkats were ranked first in the country in all college division polls and had gone 34 games, over a two-year period, without a loss. The Xavier Gold Rush eventually lost in the semi-finals to Maryland-Eastern Shore 87–80.

==NBA==
Watts was not selected by any team in the 1973 NBA draft, though he was selected by the Memphis Tams in the second round of the 1973 ABA supplemental draft. Despite that, his former coach at Xavier University, Bob Hopkins, was a cousin of Bill Russell, who was the coach and general manager for the Seattle SuperSonics. Russell gave Watts a tryout and is noted for saying that, &quot;Watts was the best-looking guard in camp and oftentimes embarrassed the other players.&quot; Watts signed with the SuperSonics as a rookie free agent.

After making the roster for the 1973–74 season as a reserve, he played more frequently the following season. On February 21, 1975, Watts recorded his first career triple-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists, along with adding 4 steals, in a 110–108 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Two days later, Watts recorded a career-high 9 steals, while also scoring 13 points and adding 14 assists, during a 114–100 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. He became a starter for the 1975–76 season. That season, he led the NBA in total assists, assists per game, total steals, steals per game, and made NBA All-Defense First-Team. He was the first player to lead the NBA in assists and steals in the same season.

In 1976, Watts also received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his outstanding service to the community. Watts followed with another productive year in the 1976–77 season, averaging 8.0 assists and 2.7 steals per game.

At the start of the 1977–78 season, Watts was re-united with Hopkins, who was hired as the Sonics&#x27; new head coach. Hopkins was fired after a 5–17 start, and new coach Lenny Wilkens made some lineup changes, one of which was to replace Watts with Dennis Johnson. Watts was eventually traded mid-season to the New Orleans Jazz for a first-round draft pick.

Watts retired from the league after the 1978–79 season due to injury. He played years with the Sonics, half a season with the New Orleans Jazz, and one season with the Houston Rockets.

He picked up the nickname &quot;Slick&quot; because he was one of the first players to shave his head, unusual at the time. He was also known for wearing his headband off-center. Despite a somewhat short tenure on the SuperSonics, Watts is viewed as one of Seattle&#x27;s more recognizable figures across sports.

==Later years==
After his playing career, Watts became a physical education teacher at Dearborn Park Elementary school and High Point Elementary school. He also coached basketball at Franklin High School in the Seattle area and took up tennis. In 2001, Watts spent 22 days in a hospital with sarcoidosis, which caused his weight to drop by almost 50 pounds before his condition improved. He ended his post-basketball career teaching physical education for nearly 20 years at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary (formerly named Brighton Elementary) in Seattle before retiring in 2017. In April 2021, three months before his 70th birthday, Watts suffered a major stroke.

==Popular culture references==
Watts is one of five 1970s Seattle SuperSonics players whose names are featured on characters in &quot;The Exterminator,&quot; the third episode of Season 1 of &quot;iZombie&quot;. The other four are Freddie Brown, Gus Williams, Wally Walker and Marvin Webster.

<text>Lewis Miller (July 24, 1829 – February 17, 1899) was an American businessman and philanthropist who made a fortune in the late 19th century as inventor of the first combine (harvester-reaper machine) with the blade mounted efficiently in front of the driver, to the side of the horse(s), rather than pulled behind. His daughter Mina (1865–1947) married fellow Ohio inventor Thomas Alva Edison on February 24, 1886.

==Biography==
Miller was born in Greentown, Ohio. He devoted much of his wealth to public service and to charitable causes associated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was the inventor of the &quot;Akron Plan&quot; for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, a configuration Miller conceived with Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent and architect Jacob Snyder. The arrangement accommodated 1) a collective opening exercise for all the children; 2) small radiating classrooms for graded instruction in the uniform lesson of the day; and 3) a general closing exercise in the central assembly area.

John Heyl Vincent collaborating was baptist layman B.F. Jacobs devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the &quot;Uniform Lesson Plan&quot;. By the 1800s, 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.

In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the Chautauqua Institution on the shores of Chautauqua Lake, New York.

Miller died in 1899 of kidney disease and was buried in Glendale Cemetery in Akron, Ohio. The Lewis Miller Cottage, his residence at Chautauqua, is a National Historic Landmark and considered one of the first prefabricated structures in the United States.

<doc id="991365" wikidata="Q7663693" url="?curid=991365" title="System X (telephony)">
<text>System X is the digital switching system installed in almost all telephone exchanges throughout the United Kingdom, from 1980 onwards.

==History==

===Development===
System X was developed by Post Office Telecommunications (later to become British Telecom), GEC, Plessey, and Standard Telephones and Cables (STC), and was first shown in public in 1979 at the Telecom 79 exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland. STC withdrew from the project in 1982. In 1988, the telecommunications divisions of GEC and Plessey merged to form GPT, with Plessey subsequently being bought out by GEC and Siemens. In the late 1990s, GEC acquired Siemens&#x27; 40% stake in GPT. GEC renamed itself Marconi in 1999.

When Marconi was sold to Ericsson in January 2006, Telent plc retained System X and continues to support and develop it as part of its UK services business.

===Implementation===
The first System X unit to enter public service, in September 1980, was installed in Baynard House, London and was a &#x27;tandem junction unit&#x27; which switched telephone calls amongst some 40 local exchanges. The first local digital exchange started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT&#x27;s Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). BT&#x27;s last electromechanical trunk exchange (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990, completing the UK&#x27;s trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical local exchanges, Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.

In addition to the UK, System X was installed in the Channel Islands, and several systems were installed in other countries, although it never achieved significant export sales.

=== Small exchanges: UXD5 ===
Separately from System X, BT developed the UXD5 (&quot;unit exchange digital&quot;), a small digital exchange which was cost-effective for small and remote communities. Developed by BT at Martlesham Heath and based on the Monarch PABX, the first example was put into service at Glenkindie, Scotland, in 1979, the year before the first System X. Several hundred of these exchanges were manufactured by Plessey and installed in rural areas, largely in Scotland and Wales. The UXD5 was included as part of the portfolio when System X was marketed to other countries.

==System X units==
System X covers three main types of telephone switching equipment. Concentrators are usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities and provide call routing functions. The BT network architecture designated exchanges as DLEs / DMSUs / DJSUs etc. but other operators configured their exchanges differently depending on their network architecture.

With the focus of the design being on reliability, the general architectural principle of System X hardware is that all core functionality is duplicated across two &#x27;sides&#x27; (side 0 and side 1). Either side of a functional resource can be the &#x27;worker&#x27; with the other being an in-service &#x27;standby&#x27;. Resources continually monitor themselves and should a fault be detected the associated resource will mark itself as &#x27;faulty&#x27; and the other side will take the load instantaneously. This resilient configuration allows for hardware changes to fix faults or perform upgrades without interruption to service. Some critical hardware such as switchplanes and waveform generators are triplicated and work on an &#x27;any 2 out of 3&#x27; basis. The CPUs in an R2PU processing cluster are quadruplicated to retain 75% performance capability with one out of service, instead of 50% if they were simply duplicated. Line cards providing customer line ports or the 2 Mbit/s E1 terminations on the switch have no &#x27;second side&#x27; redundancy, although a customer can have multiple lines or an interconnect have multiple E1s to provide resilience.

===Concentrator unit===
The concentrator unit has four main sub-systems: line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format, and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the exchange processors so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if the connection to the parent switch is lost.

Each analogue line module unit converts analogue signals from a maximum of 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal at a rate of 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse-code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto up to 480 time slots on E1s up to the exchange switch via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling. These are timeslots 0 and 16 respectively.

Depending on the hardware used, concentrators support the following line types: analogue lines (either single or multiple line groups), ISDN2 (basic rate ISDN) and ISDN30 (primary rate ISDN). ISDN can run either UK-specific DASS2 or ETSI (European) protocols. Subject to certain restrictions a concentrator can run any mix of line types, which allows operators to balance business ISDN users with residential users to give a better service to both and efficiency for the operator.

Concentrator units can either stand alone as remote concentrators or be co-located with the exchange core (switch and processors).

===Digital local exchange===
The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) hosts a number of concentrators and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual Time Switches are connected to each other by a Space Switch. The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS). The nature of the Time Switch-Space Switch architecture is such that the system is very unlikely to be affected by a faulty time or space switch, unless many faults are present. The switch is a &#x27;non-blocking&#x27; switch.

===Digital main switching unit===
The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a &#x27;trunk / transit switch&#x27;, i.e. it does not host any concentrators. As with DLEs, DMSUs are made up of a Digital Switching Subsystem and a Processor Utility Subsystem, amongst other things. In the British PSTN network, each DMSU is connected to every other DMSU in the country, enabling almost congestion-proof connectivity for calls through the network. In inner London, specialised versions of the DMSU known as DJSUs carry intra-London traffic only. The DMSU network in London has been gradually phased out and moved onto more modern &quot;NGS&quot; switches over the years as the demand for PSTN phone lines has decreased and BT has sought to reclaim some of its floorspace. The NGS switch referred to is a version of Ericsson&#x27;s AXE10 product line, phased in between the late 1990s and early 2000s.

It is common to find multiple exchanges (switches) within the same exchange building in large UK cities: DLEs for the directly connected customers and a DMSU to provide the links to the rest of the UK.

=== Combined Trunk &amp; Local Exchange===
The combined Trunk &amp; Local Exchange (CTLE) is an exchange that performs the duties of both a DLE and DMSU – it has its own directly connected subscribers and also acts as a transit switch. These can be used by smaller network operators who have a small number of exchanges.

===Processor utility subsystem===
The Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS) controls the switching operations and is the brain of the DLE or DMSU. It hosts the Call Processing, Billing, Switching and Maintenance applications Software (amongst other software subsystems). The PUS is divided into up to eight &#x27;clusters&#x27; depending on the amount of telephony traffic dealt with by the exchange. Each of the first four clusters of processors contains four central processing units (CPUs), the main memory stores (STRs) and the two types of backing store (primary (RAM) and secondary (hard disk)) memory. The PUS was coded with a version of the CORAL66 programming language known as PO CORAL (Post Office CORAL) later known as BTCORAL.

The original processor that went into service at Baynard house, London, was known as the MK2 BL processor. It was replaced in 1980 by the POPUS1 (Post Office Processor Utility Subsystem). POPUS1 processors were later installed in Lancaster House in Liverpool and also, in Cambridge. Later, these too were replaced with a much smaller system known as R2PU or Release 2 Processor Utility. This was the four CPU per cluster and up to 8-cluster system, as described above. Over time, as the system was developed, additional &quot;CCP / Performance 3&quot; clusters were added (clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8) using more modern hardware, akin to late-1990s computer technology, while the original processing clusters 0 to 3 were upgraded with, for example, larger stores (more RAM). The advanced features of this fault-tolerant system help explain why these are still in use today – like self fault detection and recovery, battery-backed RAM, mirrored disk storage, auto replacement of a failed memory unit, and the ability to trial new software (and roll back, if necessary) to the previous version. Later, the hard disks on the CCP clusters were replaced by with solid-state drives to improve reliability.

In modern times, all System X switches show a maximum of 12 processing clusters; 0–3 are the four-CPU System X-based clusters and the remaining eight positions can be filled with CCP clusters which deal with all traffic handling. Whilst the status quo for a large System X switch is to have four main and four CCP clusters, there are one or two switches that have four main and six CCP clusters.
The CCP clusters are limited to call handling only, there was the potential for the exchange software to be re-written to accept the CCP clusters, but this was scrapped as being too costly of a solution to replace a system that was already working well.
Should a CCP cluster fail, System X will automatically re-allocate its share of the call handling to another CCP cluster, if no CCP clusters are available then the exchange&#x27;s main clusters will begin to take over the work of call handling as well as running the exchange.

In terms of structure, the System X processor is a &quot;one master, many slaves&quot; configuration – cluster 0 is referred to as the base cluster and all other clusters are effectively dependent to it. If a slave cluster is lost, then call handling for any routes or concentrators dependent to it is also lost; however, if the base cluster is lost then the entire exchange ceases to function. This is a very rare occurrence, as due to the design of System X it will isolate problematic hardware and raise a fault report. During normal operation, the highest level of disruption is likely to be a base cluster restart, all exchange functions are lost for 2–5 minutes while the base cluster and its slaves come back online, but afterwards the exchange will continue to function with the defective hardware isolated. The exchange can and will restart (&#x27;rollback&#x27;) individual processes if it detects problems with them. If that doesn&#x27;t work then a cluster restart can be performed. Should the base cluster or switch be irrecoverable via restarts, the latest archive configuration can be manually reloaded using the restoration procedure. This can take hours to bring everything fully back into service as the switch has to reload all its semi-permanent paths and the concentrators have to download their configurations. Post-2020, exchange software is being modified to reduce the restoration time significantly.

During normal operation, the exchange&#x27;s processing clusters will sit between 5-15% usage, with the exception of the base cluster which will usually sit between 15 and 25% usage, spiking as high as 45% - this is due to the base cluster handling far more operations and processes than any other cluster on the switch.

===Editions of System X===
System X has gone through two major editions, Mark 1 and Mark 2, referring to the switch matrix used.

The Mark 1 Digital Subscriber Switch (DSS) was the first to be introduced. It is a time-space-time switch setup with a theoretical maximum matrix of 96x96 Time Switches. In practice, the maximum size of switch is a 64x64 Time Switch matrix. Each time switch is duplicated into two security planes, 0 and 1. This allows for error checking between the planes and multiple routing options if faults are found. Every timeswitch on a single plane can be out of service and full function of the switch can be maintained, however, if one timeswitch on plane 0 is out, and another on plane 1 is out, then links between the two are lost. Similarly, if a timeswitch has both plane 0 and 1 out, then the timeswitch is isolated.
Each plane of the timeswitch occupies one shelf in a three-shelf group – the lower shelf is plane 0, the upper shelf is plane 1 and the middle shelf is occupied by up to 32 DLTs (Digital Line Terminations). The DLT is a 2048 kbit/s 32-channel PCM link in and out of the exchange.
The space switch is a more complicated entity, but is given a name ranging from AA to CC (or BB within general use), a plane of 0 or 1 and, due to the way it is laid out, an even or odd segment, designated by another 0 and 1. The name of a space switch in software, then, can look like this. SSW H&#x27;BA-0-1.
The space switch is the entity that provides the logical cross connection of traffic across the switch, and the time switches are dependent to it. When working on a space switch it is imperative to make sure the rest of the switch is healthy as, due to its layout, powering off either the odd or even segment of a space switch will &quot;kill&quot; all of its dependent time switches for that plane.
Mark 1 DSS is controlled by a triplicated set of Connection Control Units (CCU&#x27;s) which run in a 2/3 majority for error checking, and is monitored constantly by a duplicated Alarm Monitoring Unit (AMU) which reports faults back to the DSS Handler process for appropriate action to be taken. The CCU and AMU also play part in diagnostic testing of Mark 1 DSS.

A Mark 1 System X unit is built in suites, each 8 racks in length, and there can be 15 or more suites. Considerations of space, power demand and cooling demand led to development of the Mark 2.

Mark 2 DSS (&quot;DSS2&quot;) is the later revision, which continues to use the same processor system as Mark 1, but made serious and much needed revisions to both the physical size of the switch and the way that the switch functions. It is an optical fibre-based time-space-time-space-time switching matrix, connecting a maximum of 2048 2 Mbit/s PCM systems, much like Mark 1; however the hardware is much more compact.

The four-rack group of the Mk1 CCU and AMU is gone, and replaced neatly by a single connection control rack, comprising the Outer Switch Modules (OSMs), Central Switch Modules (CSMs) and the relevant switch/processor interface hardware. The Timeswitch shelves are replaced with Digital Line Terminator Group (DLTG) shelves, which each contain two DLTGs, comprising 16 Double Digital Line Termination boards (DDLTs) and two Line Communication Multiplexors (LCMs), one for each security plane. The LCMs are connected by optical fibre over a forty megabit link to the OSMs. In total, there are 64 DLTG&#x27;s in a fully sized Mk2 DSS unit, which is analogous to the 64 Time Switches of the Mk1 DSS unit.
The Mk2 DSS unit is a lot smaller than the Mk1, and as such consumes less power and also generates less heat to be dealt with as a result. It is also possible to interface directly with SDH transmission over fibre at 40 Mbit/s, thus reducing the amount of 2 Mbit/s DDF and SDH tributary usage. Theoretically, a transit switch (DMSU) could purely interface with the SDH over fibre with no DDF at all. 
Further to this, due to the completely revised switch design and layout, the Mk2 switch manages to be somewhat faster than the Mk1 (although the actual difference is negligible in practice). It is also far more reliable, having many less discrete components in each of its sections means there is much less to go wrong, and when something does go wrong it is usually a matter of replacing the card tied to the software entity that has failed, rather than needing to run diagnostics to determine possible locations for the point of failure as is the case with Mk1 DSS.

In the early 2020s, BT commenced rationalisation of its SystemX estate to save power, cost, floorspace and improve reliability – the ageing Mk1 switches were becoming a maintenance headache. Reduced traffic volumes and reduced numbers of subscribers mean the System X estate has significant opportunity for downsizing. This rationalisation process entails re-purposing DMSUs/DJSUs equipped with Mk2 switches into CTLEs, re-parenting concentrators onto them from other exchanges and shutting down those exchanges. This results in &#x27;super CTLEs&#x27; with large (60+) numbers of concentrators hosted on them. The large number of concentrators results in a long restoration time in the event of a major fault on the exchange, so Telent have re-written the exchange software to improve restoration times. This major software revision is expected to last until network operators retire their SystemX estate, even though retirement plans are invariably taking longer than planned due to the inability of IP-based networks to handle legacy services, especially machine-to-machine communications.

===Message Transmission Subsystem===
A System X exchange&#x27;s processors communicate with its concentrators and other exchanges using its Message Transmission subsystem (MTS). MTS links are &#x27;nailed up&#x27; between nodes by re-purposing individual 64 kbit/s digital speech channels across the switch into permanent paths for the signalling messages to route over. Messaging to and from concentrators is done using proprietary messaging, messaging between exchanges is done using C7 / SS7 messaging. UK-specific and ETSI variant protocols are supported. It was also possible to use channel associated signalling, but as the UK and Europe&#x27;s exchanges went digital in the same era this was hardly used.

==Replacement system==
Many of the System X exchanges installed during the 1980s continue in service into the 2020s.

In the first decade of the 21st century, System X was scheduled for replacement with softswitch equipment as part of BT&#x27;s 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. Some other users of System X – in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston Communications – replaced their circuit-switched System X equipment with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which were intended as the replacement for System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the omission of Marconi from BT&#x27;s 21CN supplier list, and the shift in focus from telephony to broadband, led to much of the System X estate being maintained. The switched telephone network (both PSTN and ISDN) is due to be turned off on 31 January 2027, after customers are moved to voice over IP services.

<text>Brigadier General Giora &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Epstein (; born May 20, 1938), today Giora Even (), is a retired Israeli Air Force (IAF) officer and a fighter ace credited with 17 victories, 16 against Egyptian jets and one against an Egyptian Mi-8 helicopter, making Epstein the ace of aces of supersonic fighter jets and of the Israeli Air Force.
Epstein was an active IAF pilot from 1961 until May 26, 1997, when he retired at age 59. Like many retired IAF flyers, he later worked as a pilot for El Al Airlines.

== Early career ==
Epstein joined the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1956 during the Sinai War. He was initially rejected from flight school because of a heart condition and began his military career as a paratrooper. While traveling with the IDF&#x27;s parachute demonstration team, Epstein changed his last name to Even (&quot;stone&quot; in Hebrew). He left the IDF in 1959 before returning two years later to again apply for flight school.

After gaining medical clearance (mostly through his own stubbornness), Epstein began fighter training. He soon gained the nickname &quot;Hawkeye&quot; due to his extraordinary eyesight. Epstein was allegedly able to spot aircraft at a distance of 24 miles (38,4 km) — nearly three times further than a normal pilot.

== Victories: 1967–1973 ==
Epstein&#x27;s first kill came on June 6, 1967 during the Six-Day War, when he downed an Egyptian Sukhoi-7 at El Arish. During the War of Attrition in 1969–70, Epstein downed a MiG-17, another Sukhoi-7 and two MiG-21s. The rest of his kills came during 1973&#x27;s Yom Kippur War. Between October 18 and 20, 1973, he downed an Egyptian Mi-8 helicopter and eight jets: two Sukhoi-7s, two Sukhoi-20s and four MiG-21s. Then, on October 24, 1973, Epstein downed three more MiG-21s west of the Great Bitter Lake. Eight of these victories were with the French-built Mirage III, a delta wing fighter designed primarily as a high-altitude interceptor. His other nine victories came in an IAI Nesher, an Israeli-built version of the Mirage 5. Five of his kills were downed using air-to-air missiles, the rest with cannon.

== Later career and retirement ==
After the Yom Kippur War, Epstein received the Medal of Distinguished Service, one of Israel&#x27;s highest military honors. He went on to command Mirage and Kfir squadrons and was flying &quot;ready&quot; missions in the F-16 up until his 59th birthday. Epstein was a captain for El Al Airlines from 1977 to 1997.

Epstein was the primary subject of the &quot;Desert Aces&quot; episode of The History Channel series &quot;Dogfights&quot;. The episode first aired on August 10, 2007.

<doc id="991373" wikidata="Q263225" url="?curid=991373" title="Logical unit number">
<text>In computer storage, a logical unit number, or LUN, is a number used to identify a logical unit, which is a device addressed by the SCSI protocol or by Storage Area Network protocols that encapsulate SCSI, such as Fibre Channel or iSCSI. 

A LUN may be used with any device which supports read/write operations, such as a tape drive, but is most often used to refer to a logical disk as created on a SAN. Though not technically correct, the term &quot;LUN&quot; is often also used to refer to the logical disk itself.

==Examples==
To provide a practical example, a typical multi-disk drive has multiple physical SCSI ports, each with one SCSI target address assigned. An administrator may format the disk array as a RAID and then partition this RAID into several separate storage-volumes. To represent each volume, a SCSI target is configured to provide a logical unit. Each SCSI target may provide multiple logical units and thus represent multiple volumes, but this does &quot;not&quot; mean that those volumes are concatenated. The computer that accesses a volume on the disk array identifies which volume to read or write with the LUN of the associated logical unit.

In another example: a single disk-drive has one physical SCSI port. It usually provides just a single target, which in turn usually provides just a single logical unit whose LUN is zero. This logical unit represents the entire storage of the disk drive.

==Use==
&quot;How to select a LUN:&quot; In the early versions of SCSI, an initiator delivers a Command Descriptor Block (CDB) to a target (physical unit) and within the CDB is a 3-bit LUN field to identify the logical unit within the target. In current SCSI, the initiator delivers the CDB to a particular logical unit, so the LUN appears in the transport layer data structures and not in the CDB.

&quot;LUN vs. SCSI Device ID:&quot; The LUN is not the only way to identify a logical unit. There is also the SCSI Device ID, which identifies a logical unit uniquely in the world. Labels or serial numbers stored in a logical unit&#x27;s storage volume often serve to identify the logical unit. However, the LUN is the only way for an initiator to address a command to a particular logical unit, so initiators often create, via a discovery process, a mapping table of LUN to other identifiers.

&quot;Context sensitive:&quot; The LUN identifies a logical unit only within the context of a particular initiator. So two computers that access the same disk volume may know it by different LUNs.

&quot;LUN 0:&quot; There is one LUN which is required to exist in every target: zero. The logical unit with LUN zero is special in that it must implement a few specific commands, most notably Report LUNs, which is how an initiator can find out all the other LUNs in the target. But LUN zero need not provide any other services, such as a storage volume.

Many SCSI targets contain only one logical unit (so its LUN is necessarily zero). Others have a small number of logical units that correspond to separate physical devices and have fixed LUNs. A large storage system may have up to thousands of logical units, defined logically, by administrative command, and the administrator may choose the LUN or the system may choose it.

==c_t_d_s_ nomenclature in Unix==
From the computer perspective, SCSI LUN is only a part of the full SCSI address. The full device&#x27;s address is made from the:
* c-part: &quot;controller ID&quot; of the host bus adapter,
* t-part: &quot;target ID&quot; identifying the SCSI target on that controller,
* d-part: &quot;disk ID&quot; identifying a LUN on that target,
* s-part: &quot;slice ID&quot; identifying a specific partition on that disk.
In the Unix family of operating systems, these IDs are often combined into a single &quot;name&quot;. For example, &quot;/dev/dsk/c1t2d3s4&quot; would refer to controller 1, target 2, disk 3, slice 4. Presently Solaris, HP-UX, NCR, and others continue to use &quot;c_t_d_s_&quot; nomenclature, while AIX has abandoned it in favor of more familiar names. HP-UX refers to this as the Legacy Naming Model since version 11i v3.

==Other uses==
The term &quot;logical unit number&quot; also applies to an input/output access channel within certain programming languages.

<text>Leanne Rowat is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. In 2003, she was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a Progressive Conservative.

Prior to entering public life herself, Rowat was a constituency assistant to Progressive Conservative MLA Harold Gilleshammer, and worked as a community development officer in the Souris region. She also served on the board of directors of the &quot;South West Regional Health Authority&quot;, and was a Public Relations Chair for the &quot;Manitoba Winter Games 2006 Bid Committee&quot;.

When Gilleshammer retired as MLA for Minnedosa in 2003, Rowat won the Progressive Conservative nomination to replace him. The riding is mostly rural, and is located in the province&#x27;s southwestern corner. In the 2003 election, the governing New Democratic Party made the riding its top rural target. Rowat defeated NDP candidate Harvey Paterson, but by a margin of only twelve votes (as confirmed on recount). She has served as opposition critics in several areas: Culture, Heritage &amp; Tourism; Aboriginal &amp; Northern Affairs; Multiculturalism; and Communities Economic Development Fund. She is also a supporter of grandparents&#x27; rights.

Rowat was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. Prior to the 2011 provincial election, the Minnedosa riding was redistributed and dissolved. Rowat ran for election in the new riding of Riding Mountain and won the seat in 2011.

<doc id="991382" wikidata="Q1366347" url="?curid=991382" title="Jacques Courtois">
<text>Jacques Courtois () or Giacomo Cortese, called il Borgognone or le Bourguignon (12 ?December 162114 November 1676) was a Franche-Comtois–Italian painter, draughtsman, and etcher. He was mainly active in Rome and Florence and became known as the leading battle painter of his age. He also created history paintings and portraits. He became a Jesuit later in life but continued to paint.

==Life==
Jacques Courtois was born in Saint-Hippolyte, near Besançon (Franche-Comté) in present-day France, but at the time, a Spanish possession in Holy Roman Empire. He was the son of the obscure painter Jean-Pierre Courtois. Very little is known about Guillaume’s youth but it is assumed he received his initial training from his father. He had two younger brothers who also became painters Guillaume (Guglielmo Cortese) (1628 - 1679) and Jean-François (c. 1627-?). As his brother was later also known as &#x27;il Borgognone&#x27; (a reference to their origins in Burgundy, called Comté de Bourgogne or Franche-Comté in French), some of the works of the brothers have been confused.

The father took his sons to Italy around 1636 when they were still young. They first travelled to Milan. According to contemporary biographers he served for three years in the Spanish army. During this time he drew marches and battles, fight scenes, landscapes and military costumes. He then abandoned the weapons and studied for some time in Milan with an unidentified sculptor. He moved to Bologna in 1639 where he first entered the studio of Jérôme Colomès, a painter from Lorraine. According to early Italian biographer Filippo Baldinucci Courtois&#x27; talent got noticed in Bologna by prominent painters Guido Reni and Francesco Albani. He continued his apprenticeship in Siena, where he studied for some time at the school of Astolfo Petrazzi.
It is possible that the brothers Guillaume and Jacques remained together until the later 1640s. He stayed for a short time in Florence where he met two Northern painters Jan Asselijn, a battle painter, and Matthieu van Plattenberg (known as &#x27; Monsù Montagna&#x27;), a marine artist.

He went to Rome around 1639-1640 where he initially was permitted to live in the monastery of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Milan through the intercession of the abbot Don Ilarione Rancati. The abbot also was instrumental in securing Courtois&#x27; first official commissions, a large fresco of the miracle of the loaves and fishes in the refectory of the monastery (1641). In Rome he also became friends with Pieter van Laer, a Dutch genre painter active in Rome where he was known by the nickname &#x27;Bamboccio&#x27;. Pieter van Laer was known for his genre scenes, animal paintings and landscapes, which included anecdotal scenes placed in the environs of Rome. The style of genre painting practiced by Pieter van Laer was followed by other Northern and Italian painters. These followers became known as the Bamboccianti and a painting in this style as a &quot;Bambocciata&quot; (plural: &quot;Bambocciate&quot;). Michelangelo Cerquozzi, the leading battle painter in Italy in the first decades of the 17th century who also painted genre paintings in the style of the Bamboccianti, recognized Courtois&#x27; talent and encouraged him to paint battle scenes. 
During the early and mid-1640s he started to attract the patronage of prominent noble Roman families, among them the Sacchetti, Chigi Family and Pamphili. It was Pietro da Cortona who had introduced him to these noble families. He also worked for patrons outside Rome and abroad in Spain and Italy.

In 1647 Jacques Courtois married in Rome to a daughter of the minor Florentine painter Alessandro Vaiani, Anna Maria Vaiani who was a painter and engraver in her own right. His wife was already in her forties when she got married. The marriage was not successful and the couple soon separated for unknown reasons. When Courtois left Rome for Siena she did not follow him. Courtois was called to enter the service of Prince Mattias de&#x27; Medici, the then governor of Siena and brother of Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The Prince unsuccessfully tried to reconcile the spouses. The couple did not reunite when Courtois returned to Rome later that year.
After the death of his wife in 1654, Jacques Courtois had to deal with the family property and provide dowries for two of his sisters who were Ursuline nuns in Fribourg, Switzerland. He also made some religious pictures for their convent.
He spent time in Bergamo, as is documented by the altarpiece with Madonna and Saints in the parish church of Villa d&#x27;Adda, signed and dated 1656. In Bergamo, the artist got to know Count Carlo Giacomo Vecchi, the still-life painter Evaristo Baschenis and art dealer Alberto Vanghetti, for whom he painted numerous paintings and with whom he remained in correspondence until 1657. He then travelled to Venice at the invitation of Nicolò Sagredo, who had been Venice&#x27;s ambassador to Rome, having already met his brother Guillaume in Rome. Sagredo commissioned Courtois to paint two lunettes above the side doors in the church of St. Mark as well as sacred stories in the gallery. 
Passing through Padua and Bologna, Courtois returned to Florence in 1656 to work in the service of Prince Mattias de&#x27; Medici, who took him back to Siena. In 1657 he returned to Rome where he joined the Jesuit order. After becoming a Jesuit he painted a number of religious compositions but later also returned to his favorite theme of warfare. He started signing his drawings in ink with a cross.

In 1668 he became a priest. He obtained commissions for frescoes in the Church of the Gesù, the mother church of the Jesuits in Rome. He was still at work on this project when he died in Rome on 14 November 1676.

==Work==
===General===
Jacques Courtois is predominantly known for his battle scenes, although he also painted religious scenes as well as idyllic landscapes. In his religious commissions he showed his familiarity with the work of Pietro da Cortona with whom he and his brother had worked. He is also known for a few portraits including one of his patron Prince Mattias de&#x27; Medici and a self-portrait.

===War art===
Courtois painted imaginary as well historical battles drawn from various episodes of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Draw from his own firsthand experience of wartime facts and techniques, he succeeded in giving his visual representations the impression of &#x27;truthfulness&#x27;. Regarded as one of the great battle painters of the 17th century, he was referred to as the &#x27;Raphael of battles&#x27; and the &#x27;Prince Eugene of painters&#x27;. Prince Eugene was one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history. His paintings of battles were so popular that no large or small collection of his time was without a work by his hand. Courtois succeeded in creating for viewers the impression that they were actually in the thick of the battle. In Courtois&#x27; time people took great pride in the military successes of their armies. Battle paintings were, however, not only intended to celebrate national military victories. They also aimed to allow the viewer to witness the whole range of drama played out in a battle, from the brilliance of individual maneuvres and actions to the bloody consequences to the participants. Courtois relied on all his dramatic skills and compositional devices to create exciting scenes.
An example of these skills can be seen in the &quot;Battle scene with infantry, cavalry and cannon, a fortress and a city beyond&quot; (At Christie&#x27;s on 7 July 2009 in London, lot 27). In this composition Jacques Courtois has created dramatic tension by placing the key dramatic event - the hand to hand combat and tumbling of some soldiers - in the foreground in the left corner. The viewer is thus brought closer to the picture plane and the action developing in the background. The confusion of battle is expressed through the whirlwind of men and horses, which occupy a limited, closed space. The sharply receding cloudscape adds a sense of nobility to the dramatic action depicted below.

Jacques Courtois was known for working &quot;alla prima&quot; starting from rapid pen sketches. This approach to painting echoed the dynamism of his battle scenes that established his fame.
The predominant influence on his work was the work of his master Michelangelo Cerquozzi, a painter of battles and genre scenes in the style of the Bamboccianti. Jacques Courtois&#x27; battle scenes share with the Bamboccianti an interest in the anecdotal and an attention to detail. This influence became less in his more mature period through the influence of contemporary painter Salvator Rosa whom he had met in Florence, and whose night landscapes, scenes of necromancy, soldiers, battles and genre scenes he admired. The fiery battle scenes of Salvator Rosa possibly left a mark in his more painterly touch and darker colours.

===Drawings===
Courtois was also a gifted draftsman who showed in his drawings all the freedom and spontaneity of the Baroque. His sketch-books (London British Museum, and Florence, Gallerie Uffizi) demonstrate his acute ability to capture in quick sketches the movements and the dynamics of troops, while using compositional schemes, which were derived from the work of Jacques Callot. His drawings also show the influence of Stefano Della Bella.
===Graphic work===
In 1647 Courtois was one of the artists who contributed illustrations to the second volume of &quot;De Bello Belgico&quot;, a work by his fellow Jesuit Famiano Strada&#x27;s. The &quot;De Bello Belgico&quot; offers a history of the Spanish wars in Flanders in the 16th century. Courtois provided four designs, which represent the siege and capture of four cities during the war.

===Influence===
The works of Courtois had an important influence on Italian artists, in particular on Francesco Monti (il Brescianino), Francesco Simonini, Ciccio Napoletano and the French artist Joseph Parrocel. The etcher Geronimo Bruni was a pupil of Courtois.

<text>Guillaume Courtois () or italianized as Guglielmo Cortese, called Il Borgognone or Le Bourguignon (&#x27;the Burgundian&#x27;), (1628 – 14 or 15 June 1679) was a Franc-comtois-Italian painter, draughtsman and etcher. He was mainly active in Rome as a history and staffage painter and enjoyed high-level patronage. He was the brother of the painters Jacques Courtois (Giacomo Cortese) and Jean-François Courtois.

==Life==
Guillaume Courtois was born in Saint-Hippolyte (County of Burgundy), in present-day France, as the son of the obscure painter Jean-Pierre Courtois. Very little is known about Guillaume’s youth but it is assumed he received his initial training from his father. The father and his sons went to Italy circa 1636 when Guillaume was still a child. They travelled to Milan, Bologna, Venice, Florence and Siena.

The movements of the brothers Courtois are not very well documented, which has led to alternative theories. It is possible Guillaume Courtois settled in Rome by 1638 where he entered the studio of Pietro da Cortona. Here he is supposed to have supplemented his training by drawing from life and copying works of Giovanni Lanfranco and Andrea Sacchi. He studied also the Bolognese painters and Guercino, and formed for himself a classicizing style with very little express mannerism, partly resembling that of Carlo Maratta. Another view of the movements of the brothers that has gained support with modern scholars is that Guillaume and Jacques remained together until the later 1640s and that Guillaume Courtois only came under the influence of da Cortona when he worked under him in 1656.

Guillaume Courtois spent most of his active life in Rome where he died of gout on 14 or 15 June 1679.

Jean-Blaise Chardon and Antonio Dupré were his pupils.

==Work==

===General===

Guillaume Courtois was mainly a history painter of Christian religious and mythological scenes. He was also in demand as a staffage painter. He is sometimes referred to as a battle painter because of his involvement in the decorative project in the chapel of the Congregation of the Jesuits, a small oratory housed in a room of the Collegio Romano adjacent to the Sant&#x27;Ignazio Church, Rome. This was a collaborative effort of the brothers Guillaume and Jacques. It is now established that Jacques - who was a specialist in battle scenes - painted the battles in the backgrounds. Guillaume painted the scenes that depict victories attributed to the intervention of the Virgin: &quot;Heraclius defeats the armies of Chosroes&quot;, &quot;St. Pulcheria&quot;, &quot;The Triumph of Emperor Zimisches&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Louis IX of France&quot;, and &quot;Julian the Apostate pierced by Saint Mercurius&quot;. Early drawings of Guillaume Courtois represent battle scenes and show that he was initially influenced by his brother. He also produced a few portraits and collaborated with other artists on genre paintings.

Courtois’ first major public commissions were frescoes for the San Marco, Rome. Pietro da Cortona recommended the two brothers to Niccolò Sagredo, the Venetian ambassador in Rome who wished to have the church decorated. He painted the &quot;Battle of Joshua&quot; for the Gallery of Alexander VII in the Quirinal Palace and the &quot;Martyrdom of St Andrew&quot; for the high altar of the Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale.

These early works show the influence of Cortona, combined with the influence of the Baroque style of Agostino Carracci through the mediation of the more dynamic version offered by Giovanni Lanfranco’s work. These influences are reflected in the exuberance in form and color that will remain characteristic of Courtois’ work. The style of Pier Francesco Mola also formed a factor in his development. He also worked alongside Mola, Gaspard Dughet, Francesco Cozza, and Giovanni Battista Tassi on the decoration of the Valmontone Palace of Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili around 1658-1659. Some figures painted by Courtois in this Palace were previously attributed to Mola.

In 1661, he painted an &quot;Assumption&quot; for the church of San Tommaso da Villanova in Castelgandolfo in Ozzola.

In his mature work he further showed the influence of Carlo Maratta, an artist who fused the Baroque and Classicist styles. This is reflected in the sweet faces of the female figures in works such as the &quot;Madonna of the Rosary&quot; for the St. George Church in Monte Porzio Catone made in 1666 on a commission by prince Giovanni Battista Borghese.

===Collaborations===
In addition to the frequent collaborations with his brother Jacques, a number of collaborations between Guillaume Courtois and Abraham Brueghel, a Flemish still life painter active in Rome, are recorded. An example is the &quot;Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure&quot; (Sold at Sotheby&#x27;s on 29 January 2015 in New York, lot 302). The still life was painted by Brueghel while Courtois painted the figure. The painting is a variant of the &quot;Grapes and pomegranate with a vase of flowers and a female figure&quot; (private collection), which has been dated to the end of the 1660s. Courtois reprised the charming female figure in his &quot;Fruit Picker&quot; (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden), which is a collaboration with Michele Pace del Campidoglio. He also collaborated frequently on public works with Bernini, who admired his work and recommended him for commissions, and Carlo Maratta.

In 1653 he painted the figures of St. Eustace, the Good Samaritan, a St. Mary of Egypt and St. Augustine in four large landscapes of Gaspard Dughet. This was one of the earliest documented commissions of Courtois and the patron was Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili. The next year Courtois and Dughet collaborated again for the same patron on works for the Palazzo Pamphilj.

===Drawings===

Guillaume Courtois was a very skilled draughtsman as is testified by the many preparatory studies he left behind and which can be found, amongst others, in the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica. Preparatory drawings are generally in chalk, whereas compositional designs tend to be in pen and ink and wash.

The preparatory studies in chalk (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm and the Museum Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf) for &quot;The Martyrdom of St Mark&quot; fresco in San Marco are very skillful and demonstrate a fluid technique and a firm grasp of form and chiaroscuro.

<text>The Onderlinge van 1719 u.a. is a life insurance firm on the Korte Begijnestraat 14 in Haarlem, Netherlands. It is the oldest still independent life insurance firm in the Netherlands.

==History==

The fund was founded on 12 February 1719 as a &quot;begrafenisbos&quot; or funeral insurance firm. The old name was &quot;Begrafenisbos De Vrijwillige Liefdebeurs&quot;, with the motto &quot;In Alles Ghetrou&quot; (faithful in everything). This is the name that is on the facade of the building, which was designed in 1870–1871 by the Haarlem architect Adrianus van der Steur (1836–1899). The company was first located at the neighboring building, Korte Begijnestraat 16. After an argument with the neighbour, a baker whose oven &quot;made the meetings of the society overheated&quot;, the company decided to solve the mutual problem between the neighbour and the fund by buying the neighbour&#x27;s house. That house was bought and then renovated to create the current building. The building is currently located between the Toneelschuur and the Hofje van Bakenes. On occasion of the 300th anniversary of the firm, the Haarlem Opera staged an opera, named De Liefdesbeurs, dedicated to the firm.

==Fund and building today==
The board of the fund consists of 10 to 15 citizens of Haarlem. They are volunteers. The office of the fund is open every Friday evening from 19:00 to 22:00. Originally the board would meet on Sunday afternoon, after going to church, but in 1935 Friday evening was chosen. The fund still serves as a full-fledged funeral insurance firm; policies are still being sold and the company is in very good financial shape. For the fact that the building is a good example of the oeuvre of A. van der Steur, as well as the fact that it still operates under the same charter for which it was formed, both numbers 14 and 16 have rijksmonument status.

<doc id="991394" wikidata="Q2399715" url="?curid=991394" title="Personalised stamp">
<text>A personalised(orpersonalized) stamp is a postage stamp on which, for a fee, an image and/or text of the purchaser&#x27;s choosing may be placed. The stamps vary from country to country, and while some are normal stamps with a personalised label on the left attached by perforations, elsewhere the stamps are more properly regarded as one-piece personalised meter stamps with a colourful design next to the indicia. Stamps produced by Zazzle.com for the United States, for instance, are one-piece, self-adhesive with die cut margins to emulate perforations, and visually very similar to normal United States postage stamps, except for the addition of an information-based indicia (IBI) encoded by little black and white squares along one edge. A serial number appears next to the IBI.

==Usage==
Examples given by postal authorities who offer this service usually depict family members, pets or other uncontroversial subjects but users quickly realised that they could place almost any image in its space. For instance, there have been attempts to publicise missing persons, promote political causes such as Tamil independence, or to place the image of criminals or other controversial individuals on its stamps. The rules of most countries generally prohibit such things, however, stamp producers may not spot every attempt to circumvent their rules, particularly when it is not obvious who or what is being depicted, or that the image has some political or other significance.

==Austria==
The Austrian Postal Service has permitted personalisation of postage stamps. In Austria the denomination of personalised stamps can now be changed as well.

==Bhutan==
Bhutan Post issued the first personalised stamps in 2008. The stamps are issued in mini-sheets of 12 stamps with a large illustration at the left highlighting a Bhutan issue. Each stamp is framed, providing a blank space in the middle for a personal picture or company logo. In 2019 the tenth different personalised stamp sheet has been issued. Personalised stamps are especially popular with tourists. 

== India ==

My Stamp is the brand name for personalised stamps of India Post.

== Indonesia ==

Personalised stamps or &quot;Prisma&quot; (PRangko IdentitaS Milik Anda – &quot;your identity stamp&quot;, but also Indonesian for a prism) were launched in Indonesia in 2003. The guidelines allow the stamps to show portraits of one or more people, writing or signatures, logos, symbols, and slogans, and advertisements of products and services.

==Malta==
MaltaPost introduced personalised stamps in 2005. These consist of personalised labels adjoining a stamp, and MaltaPost continues to offer this service as of 2020.

==The Netherlands==
PostNL provides the possibility to make personalised stamps. A blank space in the middle of the stamp can be used for a personal picture, drawing, company logo, etc. The customer can choose from a number of different denominations (domestic rate, international rate or the special December rate).

==The United Kingdom==
Royal Mail has permitted personalisation of labels adjoining their stamps. The stamps are produced in small sheets known as smilers sheets.

==The United States==

In the United States, personalised stamps – also known as customized postage – are technically a form of meter labels and are governed by the United States Postal Service. As &quot;a form of meter labels&quot;, they are not supposed (&quot;they are not required&quot;) to be cancelled for postal purposes. Instead, a scanning machine at the post office is supposed to scan and void the postal value of that personalised stamp. For philatelic purposes, the postmarking of a personalised stamp is permitted, and it is harmless to USPS. In fact, a visible postmark is a further protection of revenue for USPS, since a postmarked personalised stamp is far less likely to be re-affixed on a mail piece for another mailing. While consumers may find that customized postage is available in a number of retail and online outlets, the USPS has authorized different companies to handle selected aspects of the program.

*Providers, including Pitney Bowes, Endicia and Stamps.com, are authorized to generate, transmit and print the indicia barcodes, ensure that images conform to USPS standards, market and sell customized postage and fulfill customer orders.
*Partners such as Zazzle can approve imagery, market, sell and fulfill orders, but they must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.
*Affiliates like Fuji can market, sell and fulfill orders, but are not authorized to approve imagery or print postage and must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.

Pitney Bowes, Stamps.com, Zazzle.com and Fuji offer USPS-approved personalised postage via Stamp Expressions, PhotoStamps and ZazzleStamps and Yourstamps.com respectively.

Consumers and businesses may also print their own postage using a small, specialized, printer, such as the Pitney Bowes Stamp Expressions Printer. Recent innovations include postal kiosks, where consumers can download an image at their local convenience store.
In June 2020, USPS has terminated the program for customized postage (personalised stamps) from all its officially-licensed vendors.
Whoever wants to design personalised stamps can do so in about 60 other countries. Not in USA or UK, anymore.

===Choice of images===

Although most postal regulations permit the exclusion of &quot;objectionable&quot; pictures on the stamps, in 2004 The Smoking Gun managed to create personalised stamps featuring the Rosenbergs, Jimmy Hoffa, Ted Kaczynski, Monica Lewinsky&#x27;s dress, Slobodan Milošević and Nicolae Ceauşescu using the service offered by stamps.com. The firm subsequently revised its policies.

===Stamps for hunters===

In 2006 Ed Owens of REACT Consulting Group, a lobbyist for the Hunters Heritage Council, complained to the U.S. Postmaster General when Zazzle.com refused to create a personalised stamp that promoted hunters as conservationists. The stamp would have borne the legends &quot;$1.7 Billion for Conservation Annually&quot; and &quot;Sportsmen... America&#x27;s First Conservationists&quot;. The creation of the stamp was refused because, Zazzle said, it &quot;Incorporates material that is primarily partisan, or political, in nature.&quot; REACT Consulting cited stamps created for the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) which it said were also partisan and political but which had been accepted for production. Zazzle eventually withdrew the HSUS stamps.

<text>In archaeology, timber circles are rings of upright wooden posts, built mainly by ancient peoples in the British Isles and North America. They survive only as gapped rings of post-holes, with no evidence they formed walls, making them distinct from palisades. Like stone circles, it is believed their purpose was ritual, ceremonial, and/or astronomical. Sometimes in North America they are referred to as &quot;woodhenge&quot;.

==British Isles==
Timber circles in the British Isles date to the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. The posts themselves have long since disappeared and the sites are identified from the rings of postholes that they stood in. Aerial photography and geophysical survey have led to the discovery of increasing numbers of the features. Often a postpipe survives in the posthole fill aiding diagnosis.

They are usually more than , and up to , in diameter and the posts that constituted them were generally more than wide. Often they consist of at least two rings or ovals of timber posts, although some consist of only one ring. Wider gaps between the posts are thought to have served as entrance routes. The builders replaced the posts as they decomposed and in some cases stone circles were adopted instead during later phases.

They appear either alone or in the context of other monuments, namely henges, such as that at Woodhenge and henge enclosures such as those at Durrington Walls. The only excavated examples of timber circles that stood alone from other features are Seahenge and Arminghall in Norfolk and the early phases of The Sanctuary in Wiltshire.

Several Early Bronze Age timber circles have been found in Ireland. A huge timber circle with a diameter of was built around a passage tomb on the Hill of Tara. Smaller timber circles were built at sites including Newgrange and Navan.

Timber circles in the British Isles likely served ritual purposes. Animal bone and domestic waste found at many timber circle sites implies some form of temporary habitation and seasonal feasting. They were built on high ground and would have been very conspicuous. Isolated burials have been found at some sites, but not enough to suggest a strong funerary purpose.

==United States==

Timber circles have a long history among Native American societies; their use stretches back for thousands of years and continues into the present day. From the 3400 year old Archaic period Poverty Point site in Louisiana to 2000 year old Hopewell tradition circles found in Ohio to the Sun Dance performed in wooden pole &quot;corrals&quot; by the Dhegihan-Siouan and Caddoan speaking peoples of the Great Plains.

An early example of a timber circle witnessed by Europeans was recorded by watercolor artist John White in July 1585 when he visited the Algonquian village of Secotan in North Carolina. White was the artist-illustrator and mapmaker for the Roanoke Colony expedition sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to begin the first attempts at British colonization of the Americas. White&#x27;s works represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of the Americas as encountered by England&#x27;s first colonizers on the Atlantic seaboard. White&#x27;s watercolor and the writings of the chronicler who accompanied him, Thomas Harriot, describes a great religious festival, possibly the Green Corn ceremony, with participants holding a ceremonial dance at a timber circle. The posts of the circle were carved with faces. Harriot noted that many of the participants had come from surrounding villages and that &quot;&quot;every man attyred in the most strange fashion they can devise havinge certayne marks on the backs to declare of what place they bee.&quot; and that &quot;Three of the fayrest Virgins&quot;&quot; danced around a central post at the center of the timber circle.

===Poverty Point===
The oldest known timber circles in North American archaeology were found at Poverty Point in 2009 by archaeologists from the University of Louisiana at Monroe and Mississippi State University, led by Poverty Point station archaeologist Dr. Diana Greenlee. They discovered evidence in the plaza area for multiple wooden post circular structures ranging from to in diameter; built during the earliest habitation of the site circa 2400 BCE. The site now has a ring of concrete posts marking the position of one of the circles.

===Adena timber circles===

Postholes from a number of timber circles have been found during excavations of Adena culture causewayed ring ditch sites in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky and adjacent regions of Ohio and West Virginia. A notable example was found by archaeologist William S. Webb during the excavations of the Mount Horeb Site 1 in Fayette County, Kentucky in 1939. Webb discovered a circle of &quot;paired-posts&quot; inside of the embankment ring and ditch. The circle was made up of sixty two &quot;paired&quot; post sets and eight single posts.

===Hopewell timber circles===

Other examples have been found at Hopewell culture sites in Ohio. Moorehead Circle was constructed about two millennia ago at the Fort Ancient Earthworks. It was discovered in 2005 by Jarrod Burks during magnetic surveys at the large hilltop enclosure near Lebanon, Ohio. The site consists of three concentric circles; with the outer circle being about in diameter. Robert Riordan, Professor of Archaeology at Wright State University and lead archaeologist investigating the site, estimates that about two hundred wooden to tall posts were set in the outer circle. According to radiocarbon dates performed on charcoal found at the site, it was built between 40 BCE and 130 CE, with other charcoal fragments from burnt posts dating to 250 to 420 CE, suggesting the circle was in use for several centuries.

In September 2005 archaeologist Frank Cowan conducted excavations at the smaller circular enclosure at the Stubbs Earthworks in Warren County, Ohio; discovering a timber circle in diameter and composed of 172 large posts. Carbon dating of charcoal found in post molds at the site have dated the structure to 200-300 CE.

===Cahokia ===

The existence of the series of woodhenges at Cahokia was discovered during salvage archaeology undertaken by Dr. Warren Wittry in the early 1960s in preparation for a proposed highway interchange. Although the majority of the site contained village house features, a number of unusually shaped large post holes were also discovered. They formed a series of arcs of evenly spaced posts. Wittry hypothesized that the arcs could be whole circles and that the site was possibly a calendar for tracking solar events such as solstice and equinoxes. He began referring to the circles as &quot;woodhenges&quot;; comparing the structures to ones found in England. Additional excavations found evidence for five timber circles in the general vicinity, now designated Woodhenges I through V in Roman numerals. Each was a different diameter and had a different number of posts. Because four of the circles overlap each other it is thought they were built in a sequence, with each iteration generally being larger and containing 12 more posts than its predecessor. A full sequence for what has become known as Woodhenge III was found (except for nine posts on the western edge that had been lost to dump trucks for road construction fill) and a reconstruction of the circle was built in 1985; with the posts being placed into the original excavated post positions. The Illinois State Park system oversees the Cahokia site and hosts public sunrise observations at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices. Out of respect for Native American beliefs these events do not feature ceremonies or rituals of any kind.

Archaeologist Marvin Fowler has speculated that the woodhenges also served as “aligners” and that there may have been as many as 3 more in other strategic locations around the city of Cahokia, built to triangulate and lay out construction projects. At least one other possible circle at Cahokia has been put forward by Fowler, but his suggestion has not yet gained full acceptance by other archaeologists. This location was discovered near Mounds 72 and 96, directly to the south of Monks Mound. Several post holes of what may have been a ceremonial area with a in diameter circle and 48 posts. Archaeologists have dated the placement of at least one of the posts to approximately 950 CE. Archaeological research has shown that four of the posts were at the cardinal locations of north, south, east and west, with eastern and western posts marking the position of the equinox sunrise and sunsets. Four other posts in the circle were shown to be at the summer solstice sunrise and sunset and the winter solstice sunrise and sunset positions. This setup is nearly identical to the diameter and post positions of Woodhenge III, differing only in that Woodhenge III was smaller in diameter. The placement of the two mounds at the location and the directions in which they are oriented correspond to several of the solstice marking posts. The post nearest the later elite burial of the &quot;Birdman&quot; is the location that marked the summer solstice sunrise at the times of the sites use. The early stages of the mounds were actually constructed around the posts, although at a later point the posts were removed.

<text>In the computer storage field, a Fibre Channel switch is a network switch compatible with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. It allows the creation of a Fibre Channel fabric, that is the core component of a storage area network (SAN). The fabric is a network of Fibre Channel devices which allows many-to-many communication, device name lookup, security, and redundancy. FC switches implement zoning, a mechanism that disables unwanted traffic between certain fabric nodes.

Fibre Channel switches may be deployed one at a time or in larger multi-switch configurations. SAN administrators typically add new switches as their server and storage needs grow, connecting switches together via fiber optic cable using the standard device ports. Some switch vendors offer dedicated high-speed stacking ports to handle inter-switch connections (similar to existing stackable Ethernet switches), allowing high-performance multi-switch configurations to be created using fewer switches overall.

Major manufacturers of Fibre Channel switches include Brocade(Broadcom), Cisco Systems, and QLogic(Marvell).

== Fibre Channel Director ==
A special variety of a FC switch is the &quot;Fibre Channel Director,&quot; a switch meant to provide backbone infrastructure in a fabric usually featuring at least 128 ports and high-availability attributes, however the term is loose and varies among to manufacturers. It does not differ from a switch in core FC protocol functionality. The &quot;director&quot; term itself is derived from legacy ESCON Directors such as the IBM 9032-005.

<doc id="991400" wikidata="Q961936" url="?curid=991400" title="Magdalen papyrus">
<text>The &quot;Magdalen&quot; papyrus (, ) was purchased in Luxor, Egypt in 1901 by Reverend Charles Bousfield Huleatt (1863–1908), who identified the Greek fragments as portions of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; (Chapter 26:23 and 31) and presented them to Magdalen College, Oxford, where they are catalogued as &quot;P. Magdalen Greek 17&quot; (Gregory-Aland 𝔓64) from which they acquired their name. When the fragments were published by Colin Henderson Roberts in 1953, illustrated with a photograph, the hand was characterized as &quot;an early predecessor of the so-called &#x27;Biblical Uncial which began to emerge towards the end of the 2nd century. The uncial style is epitomised by the later biblical Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Comparative paleographical analysis has remained the methodological key for dating the manuscript, but there is no consensus on the dating of the papyrus. Estimates have ranged from the 1st century to the 4th century AD.

The fragments are written on both sides, indicating they came from a codex rather than a scroll. More fragments, published in 1956 by Ramon Roca-Puig, cataloged as &quot;P. Barc. Inv. 1&quot; (Gregory-Aland 𝔓67), were determined by Roca-Puig and Roberts to come from the same codex as the Magdalen fragments, a view which has remained the scholarly consensus.

== Date ==

𝔓64 was originally given a 3rd-century date by Charles Huleatt, who donated the Manuscript to Magdalen College. Papyrologist A. S. Hunt then studied the manuscript and dated it to the early 4th century. After initially preferring a 3rd or possibly 4th century dating for the papyrus, Colin Roberts published the manuscript and gave it a dating of , which was confirmed by three other leading papyrologists: Harold Bell, T. C. Skeat and E. G. Turner.
In late 1994, Carsten Peter Thiede proposed redating the Magdalen papyrus to the middle of the 1st century (AD 37 to 70). This attracted considerable publicity, as journalists interpreted the claim optimistically. Thiede&#x27;s official article appeared in &quot;Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik&quot; in 1995. A version edited for the layman was co-written with Matthew d&#x27;Ancona and presented as &quot;The Jesus Papyrus&quot;, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, 1996. (also published as: &quot;Eyewitness to Jesus&quot;, 1996, New York: Doubleday). Thiede&#x27;s redating of the papyrus was based on comparative analysis of the script with selected samples from Egypt and Palestine. He claimed to see similarities between the script of the Magdalen papyrus and that of dated documents from the 1st century CE, such as P.Oxy. II 246 (66 CE). Thiede&#x27;s hypothesis has been viewed with scepticism by nearly all established papyrologists and biblical scholars.

Philip Comfort and David Barret in their book &quot;Text of the Earliest NT Greek Manuscripts&quot; argue for a more general date of 150–175 for the manuscript, and also for 𝔓4 and 𝔓67, which they argue came from the same codex. 𝔓4 was used as stuffing for the binding of “a codex of Philo, written in the later 3rd century and found in a jar which had been walled up in a house at Coptos [in 250].” If 𝔓4 was part of this codex, then the codex may have been written roughly 100 years prior or earlier. Comfort and Barret also show that this 𝔓4/64/67 has affinities with a number of the late 2nd-century papyri.

Comfort and Barret &quot;tend to claim an earlier date for many manuscripts included in their volume than might be allowed by other palaeographers.&quot; The Novum Testamentum Graece, a standard reference for the Greek witnesses, lists 𝔓4 and 𝔓64/67 together, giving them a date of c. 200. Charlesworth has concluded &#x27;that 𝔓64+67 and 𝔓4, though written by the same scribe, are not from the same ... codex.&#x27; The most recent and thorough palaeographic assessment of the papyrus concluded that &quot;until further evidence is forthcoming perhaps a date from mid-II to mid-IV should be assigned to the codex.&quot;

<text>Berwick Street is a street in the Soho district of the City of Westminster, running between Oxford Street to the north and Peter Street at the south. It was built towards the end of the 17th century; several early 18th century buildings have survived. The street is the site of a year old street market.

==History==
Berwick Street was built between 1687 and 1703, and is believed to be named after James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick. Several buildings constructed in the 1730s are still standing, such as the Green Man public house at No. 57, which was built in 1738.

A non-conforming church in Berwick Street was opened in 1689. A new church designed by Edward Blore and dedicated to St Luke, was consecrated on 23 July 1839.

A major cholera outbreak was centred around Berwick Street in 1854.

Kemp House is at No. 90. It was constructed between 1959-61 by L. C. Hollbrook.

==Market==
Whilst some secondary sources claim that the market was established in the 18th century, the market is not listed in London Labour and the London Poor by Henry Mayhew&#x27;s. In 1893 the London County Council&#x27;s survey of London markets, records that the market began in . The report states that many of the traders had relocated from Seven Dials following the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue. It lists 32 stalls on a Saturday with 20 being present on weekdays. Ten of the traders are listed as grocers or fruiters.

There is a small outdoor general retail market on Berwick Street, selling fruit and vegetables, hot food, fish, clothing, accessories, household goods, luggage, jewelry and general goods. It is open Monday to Saturday from 8 am until 6 pm.

===Critical response===
The film received negative reviews from critics. 

Ella Taylor of the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; said of the film, &quot;A terrific premise is mangled to a pulp, then beaten to death in this forced mockumentary.&quot; E! was less kind, stating, &quot;This Day not only lacks Mexicans but also good acting, sharp storytelling, and humor.&quot; At the Cartagena Film Festival, the film earned a nomination for Best Film and won Best Screenplay. It also earned a special jury award at the Gramado Film Festival and Best Editing at the Guadalajara Film Festival.

<text>Deptford Market (also known as Deptford High Street Market) is a fruit &amp; vegetable and antiques and bric-a-brac market located in Deptford, south east London.

==History==
One of south London&#x27;s busiest, the Deptford market has been in Deptford High Street for centuries. London&#x27;s first railway, from London to Greenwich was built through Deptford in 1836. Christopher Marlowe, the playwright was murdered nearby.

Many of the stalls have passed from one generation to the other.

==Economy==
A collection of new and used goods, with a prominence of food stalls spread out on the side streets and pavements, this vibrant market is filled with a diverse range of stallholders.

==Details==
The market takes place every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, from around 7am until 4pm, in Deptford High Street, Douglas Way and the junction with Giffin Street. To see the whole range of stalls it is best to visit before midday as some stallholders pack up early.

There is a broad mix of stalls selling items from fresh fish, foods, groceries, to antiques, second hand clothes and collectibles. Many of the stalls sell ethnic goods, including African, Indian and Chinese foodstuff.

It benefits in having a Docklands Light Railway Station and a National Rail Station close by.

<text>An &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax (Latin for &quot;according to value&quot;) is a tax whose amount is based on the value of a transaction or of a property. It is typically imposed at the time of a transaction, as in the case of a sales tax or value-added tax (VAT). An &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax may also be imposed annually, as in the case of a real or personal property tax, or in connection with another significant event (e.g. inheritance tax, expatriation tax, or tariff). In some countries, a stamp duty is imposed as an &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax.

== Operation ==
All ad valorem taxes are collected according to the determined value of the taxed item. In the most common application of ad valorem taxes, namely municipal property taxes, public tax assessors regularly assess the property owner&#x27;s real estate in order to determine its current value.

The determined value of the property is used to calculate the annual tax collected by the municipality or any other government entity upon the property owner. Ad valorem taxes are based on real property ownership and can therefore be compared with transaction taxes (i.e. sales taxes). Ad valorem tax is determined and collected every year, while transaction tax is only levied at the time of transaction.

=== Collection ===
Municipalities usually collect property ad valorem taxes, but they are levied also by government entities; examples are counties, school districts, or special taxation zones, also known as special purpose zones. Many entities can collect ad valorem taxes from the property owners; for example, a city and a county. Ad valorem property taxes are usually the main source of income for state and municipal governments. Municipal property ad valorem taxes are often referred to as &quot;property taxes&quot;.

=== Tax value ===
Generally, starting from January 1 of each year, the tax assessment used to determine ad valorem taxes is calculated. Ad valorem tax as a percentage of the value of the assessed property, usually the fair market value of the property. Fair market price refers to the estimated selling price of the property. It is assumed that both willing buyers and sellers have the willingness to trade, and both parties have a reasonable understanding of all relevant facts about the property, and both parties are not obliged to complete the transaction. Fair market value can be seen as just a reasonable price.

== Examples ==
There are different ad valorem taxes and they are based in some cases on the ownership of real assets ( i.e. property tax), or alternatively they can be &quot;transactional taxes&quot;: example is a sales tax. Property taxes usually are determined and collected with annual incidence, while transactional taxes take places at the time when the transaction occurs.

=== Land value tax ===
With land value taxes (LVT), which are still ad valorem taxes, just the value of the land itself is taxed. Buildings, personal property and any kind of decoration are ignored by the following tax. LVT is different from other real estate taxes. Practically speaking, every jurisdiction collecting real estate property tax includes land value tax, since land value has a meaningful impact on the overall property value. In 1879, Henry George published &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, by which he advocated a flat tax on lands based on the original unimproved value of the latters in their natural state, the &quot;land value tax&quot;. George believed this tax was sufficient to support all government programs, being substantially a &quot;single tax&quot;.

The idea behind his thought was, instead of taxing labor and capital, to tax the rent of land and natural opportunities, in order to regain the rent for public use. He pointed out that in general, taxation will stifle production behavior: he thought that incomes taxation reduces people&#x27;s motivation to earn an income, taxation of wheat reduces wheat production, and so on. However, taxing the value of unimproved land has different effects: it&#x27;s possible to distinguish two different sources of value for a land, the natural value of the land and the value created by improving it (for example, by building value on the land). Since the value of unacquired land is not earned, neither land value nor land value tax will affect production behavior (Hooper 2008).

===Sales tax===
A sales tax is a consumption tax charged at the point of purchase for certain goods and services. The tax is usually set as a percentage by the government charging the tax. There is usually a list of exemptions. The tax can be included in the price (tax-inclusive) or added at the point of sale (tax-exclusive).

Ideally, a sales tax is fair, has a high compliance rate, is difficult to avoid, is charged every time an item is sold retail, and is simple to calculate and simple to collect. A conventional or retail sales tax attempts to achieve this by charging the tax only on the final end user, unlike a gross receipts tax levied on the intermediate business which purchases materials for production or ordinary operating expenses prior to delivering a service or product to the marketplace. This prevents so-called tax &quot;cascading&quot; or &quot;pyramiding&quot;, in which an item is taxed more than once as it makes its way from production to final retail sale. There are several types of sales taxes: seller or vendor taxes, consumer excise taxes, retail transaction taxes, or value-added taxes.

===Value-added tax===
A value-added tax (VAT), or goods and services tax (GST), is a tax on exchanges. It is levied on the added value that results from each exchange. It differs from a sales tax because a sales tax is levied on the total value of the exchange. For this reason, a VAT is neutral with respect to the number of passages that there are between the producer and the final consumer. A VAT is an indirect tax, in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost of the tax (namely the seller rather than the consumer). To avoid double taxation on final consumption, exports (which by definition are consumed abroad) are usually not subject to VAT and VAT charged under such circumstances is usually refundable.

==== History ====
The origin of the value-added tax is a debatable topic. It is variously ascribed to either German businessman Wilhelm von Siemens in 1918, or American economist Thomas S. Adams in his works between the years 1910-1921. Adams intended the VAT as an alternative to the business income tax and meant it not as an appendix to the federal income tax system in existence at the time but as its major alternation. In contrast the innovators in Germany thought of the VAT as a substitution for an already existing sales tax and as an adjunct to the tax on income.

Firstly VAT was introduced in France in 1954, but its usage was limited only to several cases. First full-scale VAT was put in place in Denmark in 1967. The spread of VAT was helped by the fact that European Union began to require members to adopt the VAT upon their entrance to the EU. Major influences in the spread of VAT outside of the EU are generally attributed to the IMF and the World Bank. Ironically the United States, who to this day do not have the VAT, promoted the tax largely in their post WWII occupation of Japan as well as in their advisory activities to developing economies.

===Property tax===
A property tax, millage tax is an &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax that an owner of real estate or other property pays on the value of the property being taxed. Ad valorem property taxes are collected by local government departments (examples are counties, cities, school districts, and special tax districts) on real property or personal property. Ad valorem property taxes are usually a main, if not the main, source of income for state and municipal governments. Municipal ad valorem property tax is often referred to as &quot;property tax&quot; for short. The owner of the property should pay this tax based on the value of the property.

Ad valorem taxes refer to goods or property taxes seen as a percentage of the sales price or estimated value. They belong to the assessed value range (because this is the only way to estimate the &quot;sales price&quot;). There are three species or types of property: Land, Improvements to Land (immovable man made things), and Personal (movable man made things).

Real estate, real property or realty are all terms for the combination of land and improvements. The taxing authority requires and/or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of the property, and tax is assessed in proportion to that value. Forms of property tax used vary between countries and jurisdictions. Usually, ad valorem taxes are calculated as a percentage of the estimated value of the considered property.

The estimated value of a property usually refers to the annual determination of the fair market value. &quot;Fair market value&quot; is generally defined as the price that willing buyers are willing to pay and the price of property that willing sellers are willing to accept, and neither price is forced to buy or sell.

It is also considered as the price at which a property changes hands between a potential buyer and a potential seller when both parties have reliable knowledge of all necessary facts and do not require buying or selling. Most tax authorities require regular inspections of the subject matter during the evaluation process and decide evaluation measures to determine fair market value.

Though, there is no uniform tax base that applies to all places. In some countries, property taxes are based on the value of the property depending on market value, site value, rental value. In different countries, taxes are calculated on building area and property area - called unit value. These methods can also be used in combination.

==== History ====
Property taxes have existed since the first ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Babylon, Persia and China. Ancient Greece and ancient Rome also had various property taxes. One of the earliest well documented ad valorem taxes known in Europe is the Danegeld – a land-tax first imposed in 1012 in Britain to pay off Viking raiders. The amount of tax collected was based on the value of the taxpayer&#x27;s property – usually measured by a local unit to determine the size of the land. Since the Danegeld became in time too complicated to collect, it was later replaced by Carucage, also a tax based on the size of land owned by the taxpayer.

==Application of a sales or property tax==
===United States===
&quot;Ad valorem&quot; duties are important to those importing goods into the United States because the amount of duty owed is often based on the value of the imported commodity. &quot;Ad valorem&quot; taxes (mainly real property tax and sales taxes) are a major source of revenues for state and municipal governments, especially in jurisdictions that do not employ a personal income tax. Virtually all state and local sales taxes in the United States are &quot;ad valorem&quot;.

&quot;Ad valorem&quot; is used most frequently to refer to the value placed on property by the county tax assessors. An assessment is made against this value by applying an assessment rate (e.g. 100%, 60%, 40%, etc.). The net assessment is determined after subtracting any exemptions to which the property owner is entitled (e.g. homestead exemptions), and a tax or millage rate is applied to this net assessment to determine the ad valorem tax due from the property owner.

The two main basis for determining the ad valorem value are fair market value and current use value. The fair market value is based on the typical selling price for property on which the buyer and seller can agree, with the assumption that the property is being used or will be used at its highest and best use after the sale. The current use value is the typical selling price for property with an assumption that it will continue after the sale to be used in its current use rather than being converted to its highest and best use. State legislatures have created many variations to these two main valuation approaches.

In some states, a central appraisal authority establishes values on all properties and distributes these to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority, which then sets a tax rate and imposes the local ad valorem tax. In other states, a central appraisal authority values certain properties that are difficult to value at the local level (e.g. railroads, electric companies and other utility companies) and sends these values to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority, while the local tax assessors determine the value on all other property in the county or jurisdiction.

&quot;Ad valorem&quot; tax, most frequently referred to as property tax, relates to the tax that results when the net assessed value of a property is multiplied times the millage rate applicable to that property. This millage rate is usually expressed as a multiple of 1/1000 of a dollar. Thus the fractional amount of 0.001 will be expressed as 1 mill when expressed as an ad valorem tax millage rate.

The tax determined from multiplying the ad valorem assessment times the ad valorem tax rate is typically collected by the tax collector or tax commissioner.

==Application of a value-added tax==
===United Kingdom===
The third largest source of government revenues is value-added tax (VAT), charged at the standard rate of 20% on supplies of goods and services. It is therefore a tax on consumer spending. Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, and others are subject to VAT at a lower rate of 5% (the reduced rate) or 0% (&quot;zero-rated&quot;).

===Canada===
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) (French: Taxe sur les produits et services, TPS) is a multi-level value-added tax introduced in Canada on January 1, 1991, by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and finance minister Michael Wilson. The GST replaced a hidden 13.5% Manufacturers&#x27; Sales Tax (MST) because it hurt the manufacturing sector&#x27;s ability to export. The introduction of the GST was very controversial. As of January 1, 2012, the GST stood at 5%.

As of July 1, 2010, the federal GST and the regional Provincial Sales Tax (PST) were &#x27;harmonized&#x27; into a single value-added sales tax, called the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The HST came into effect in five of the ten Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island later entered into a similar agreement to harmonize and implement an HST in that province, while effective April 1, 2013, the Government of British Columbia eliminated the HST and reinstated PST and GST on taxable services provided in British Columbia.
===Australia===
The Goods and Services Tax is a value-added tax of 10% on most goods and services sold in Australia.

It was introduced by the Howard Government on 1 July 2000, replacing the previous federal wholesale sales tax system and designed to phase out the various state and territory taxes such as banking taxes, stamp duty and land value tax. While this was the stated intent at the time, the States still charge duty on a various transactions, including but not limited to vehicle transfers and land transfers, insurance contracts and agreements for the sale of land. Many States, such as Western Australia, have made recent amendments to duties laws to phase out particular duties and clarify existing ones. The &quot;Duties Act 2008&quot; (WA) is available online at the Western Australian State Law Publisher

===New Zealand===
The Goods and Services Tax is a value-added tax of 15% on most goods and services sold in New Zealand.

It was introduced by the Fourth Labour Government on 1 October 1986 at a rate of 10%. This was increased to 12.5% on 1 July 1989 and 15% on 1 October 2010.

===Europe===
A common VAT system is compulsory for the member states of the European Union. The EU VAT system is imposed by a series of European Union directives, the most important of which is the Sixth VAT Directive (Directive 77/388/EC). Nevertheless, some member states have negotiated variable rates (Madeira in Portugal) or VAT exemption for regions or territories. The regions below fall out of the scope of EU VAT:
* Åland (Finland)
* Heligoland island, Büsingen am Hochrhein territory (Germany)
* Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion (France)
* Mount Athos (Greece)
* Ceuta, Melilla, The Canary Islands (Spain)
* Livigno, Campione d&#x27;Italia, Lake Lugano (Italy)
* Gibraltar, The Channel Islands (United Kingdom)

Under the EU system of VAT, where a person carrying on an economic activity supplies goods and services to another person, and the value of the supplies passes financial limits, the supplier is required to register with the local taxation authorities and charge its customers, and account to the local taxation authority for VAT (although the price may be &quot;inclusive&quot; of VAT, so VAT is included as part of the agreed price, or &quot;exclusive&quot; of VAT, so VAT is payable in addition to the agreed price).

VAT that is charged by a business and paid by its customers is known as &quot;output&quot; VAT (that is, VAT on its output supplies). VAT that is paid by a business to other businesses on the supplies that it receives is known as &quot;input&quot; VAT (that is, VAT on its input supplies). A business is generally able to recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT is attributable to (that is, used to make) its taxable outputs. Input VAT is recovered by setting it against the output VAT for which the business is required to account to the government, or, if there is an excess, by claiming a repayment from the government.

Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states. The minimum standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 15%, although reduced rates of VAT, as low as 5%, are applied in various states on various sorts of supply (for example, domestic fuel and power in the UK). The maximum rate in the EU is 25%.

The Sixth VAT Directive requires certain goods and services to be exempt from VAT (for example, postal services, medical care, lending, insurance, betting), and certain other goods and services to be exempt from VAT but subject to the ability of an EU member state to opt to charge VAT on those supplies (such as land and certain financial services). Input VAT that is attributable to exempt supplies is not recoverable, although a business can increase its prices so the customer effectively bears the cost of the &#x27;sticking&#x27; VAT (the effective rate will be lower than the headline rate and depend on the balance between previously taxed input and labour at the exempt stage).

Finally, some goods and services are &quot;zero-rated&quot;. The zero-rate is a positive rate of tax calculated at 0%. Supplies subject to the zero-rate are still &quot;taxable supplies&quot;, i.e. they have VAT charged on them. In the UK, examples include most food, books, drugs, and certain kinds of transport. The zero-rate is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some Member States, most notably the UK, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These Member States have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services.
The UK also exempts or lowers the rate on some products depending on situation; for example milk products are exempt from VAT, but if you go into a restaurant and drink a milk drink it is VAT-able. Some products such as feminine hygiene products and baby products (nappies etc.) are charged at 5% VAT along with domestic fuel.

When goods are imported into the EU from other states, VAT is generally charged at the border, at the same time as customs duty. &quot;Acquisition&quot; VAT is payable when goods are acquired in one EU member state from another EU member state (this is done not at the border but through an accounting mechanism). EU businesses are often required to charge themselves VAT under the &quot;reverse charge&quot; mechanism where services are received from another member state or from outside of the EU.

Businesses can be required to register for VAT in EU member states, other than the one in which they are based, if they supply goods via mail order to those states, over a certain threshold. Businesses that are established in one member state but which receive supplies in another member state may be able to reclaim VAT charged in the second state under the provisions of the Eighth VAT Directive (Directive 79/1072/EC). To do so, businesses have a value added tax identification number. A similar directive, the Thirteenth VAT Directive (Directive 86/560/EC), also allows businesses established outside the EU to recover VAT in certain circumstances.

Following changes introduced on July 1, 2003, (under Directive 2002/38/EC), non-EU businesses providing digital electronic commerce and entertainment products and services to EU countries are also required to register with the tax authorities in the relevant EU member state, and to collect VAT on their sales at the appropriate rate, according to the location of the purchaser. Alternatively, under a special scheme, non-EU businesses may register and account for VAT on only one EU member state. This produces distortions as the rate of VAT is that of the member state of registration, not where the customer is located, and an alternative approach is therefore under negotiation, whereby VAT is charged at the rate of the member state where the purchaser is located.

The differences between different rates of VAT was often originally justified by certain products being &quot;luxuries&quot; and thus bearing high rates of VAT, whereas other items were deemed to be &quot;essentials&quot; and thus bearing lower rates of VAT. However, often high rates persisted long after the argument was no longer valid. For instance, France taxed cars as a luxury product (33%) up into the 1980s, when most of the French households owned one or more cars. Similarly, in the UK, clothing for children is &quot;zero rated&quot; whereas clothing for adults is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 20%.

== Analysis ==
Starting with the land-value vax, since it is believed that the market usually redistributes resources functionally, the best tax is the one that causes the least distortion of market incentives; land value tax meets this standard. In addition, the land&#x27;s value in a certain locality will be influenced by local government services, so it may be considered fair to tax landowners in proportion to the value of the proceeds received to finance these services. Henry George is correct that other taxes may have a stronger inhibitory effect but now a single land tax is not recognized innocent by economists. The site value is created, not inherent.

A tax on the value of the site is actually a tax on the production potential, that is the consequence of land improvement in the area. George (1897) proposed to impose a tax on a piece of land based on the improvement of adjacent land (Hooper 2008). Rothbard (2004) believes that a &quot;neutral tax&quot; is the best thing to make the market free and without problems. The low-income earners have the biggest burden because consumption taxes (i.e. sales tax and value-added tax) are regressive. To compensate for this, taxes on necessities are usually lower than taxes on luxury goods. Supporters of this kind of taxation believe that it is an effective way to increase income and reduce income tax accordingly. Opponents believe that, as a diminishing tax, it places too much burden on the low-income earners. When the tax burden is borne by the producers, the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say said: &quot;taxes, over time, cripple production itself&quot; (Say 1880, 447). As some form of taxation is necessary to finance public institutions serving society, such taxation should be fair and helpful. Say (1880) said, &quot;The best scheme of [public] finance is, to spend as little money as possible; and the best tax is always the lightest.&quot; At the end, the challenge is to guarantee that ad valorem taxes do not cause more problems than other forms of taxation (i.e. income tax).

==Impact==
The theory of the firm shows that taxes on transfers can encourage firms to internalize costs and grow, whereas the absence of such transactions may result in a larger number of individually smaller firms. For example, a sales tax – unlike a VAT – would realign the incentives of a steel mill in favor of operating its own coal mine, as opposed to simply buying coal in a transaction subject to taxation; the theory of the firm&#x27;s model suggests that this would be less economically efficient as it results in a decline in specialization.

<doc id="991426" wikidata="Q4733529" url="?curid=991426" title="Alma College">
<text>Alma College is a private Presbyterian liberal arts college in Alma, Michigan. It enrolls approximately 1,200 students and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Alma College is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in multiple disciplines as well as four master&#x27;s degree programs. Its athletics teams, nicknamed the Scots, are part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) – Division III and the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA).

==History==
The college was founded by Michigan Presbyterians in 1886. It received funding from lumber magnate Ammi W. Wright, for whom Wright Hall on campus and Wright Avenue in the city of Alma are named.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan History Division, Department of State. The inscription reads:

On October 26, 1886, the Presbyterian Synod of Michigan accepted an offer by Ammi W. Wright of Alma of thirty acres of land, containing two buildings, and a gift of $50,000 from Alexander Folsom of Bay City, for the purpose of establishing Alma College. The Synod had resolved: &quot;We will, with God&#x27;s help, establish and endow a college within our bounds.&quot; A charter was granted by the state of Michigan, April 15, 1887. Classes began September 12, 1887. In the first year there were 95 students and nine faculty members. Here the Presbyterian Church has fostered the pursuit of learning to the glory of God and to the dignity of men.
The college&#x27;s 13th president, Jeff Abernathy, assumed leadership in June 2010. He was succeeded in 2024 by long-time trustee and alumnus Eric Blackhurst as interim president after Abernathy stepped down to focus on the Alma College Prison Initiative. Joseph L. Odenwald, former president of Southwestern Michigan College, was announced in February 2025 as the college&#x27;s next president beginning on June 1.

===Scottish heritage===

In 1931, the College hosted a contest to replace their current mascot at the time, the Fighting Presbyterians, and &quot;the Scots&quot;—a nod to the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s roots in Scotland—was chosen. Since that time, Alma College has embraced its Scottish traditions. Today, this is evident through many programs and symbols, including the Alma College Pipe Band, Kiltie Dancers, and its tartan.

While still maintaining a close relationship with the Presbyterian Church, Alma College accepts and welcomes students of all religious backgrounds.

==Academics==

Alma College offers more than 45 undergraduate academic programs, and four graduate programs, leading to Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Arts. In addition to the academic majors, numerous concentrations, academic institutes, and special programs are offered, including the Presidential Honors Program and the Center for College and Community Engagement. Its most popular majors, in terms of 2023 graduates, were:
::Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services (52)
::Health Professions and Related Programs (32)
::Education (30)
::Biological and Biomedical Sciences (23)
::Psychology (23)

Along with its on-campus options, Alma College offers a number of domestic off-campus and internship programs, in cities including Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington DC. Alma offers international study programs in countries including Argentina, Australia, Ecuador, England, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Peru, Scotland and Spain.

Alma has a 4-4-1 academic calendar, with 14-week terms in the fall and winter, and a four-week term in May. Students typically use the latter term, known on-campus as Spring Term, for travel, classes, research and internships.

===Graduate degrees===

Alma College in 2021 launched the first graduate program in its then-134-year history with the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing degree, led by author and educator Sophfronia Scott.

In 2022, the college launched a Master of Science in Communication and Information Technology degree. In 2023, the college launched a Master of Arts in Special Education with Learning Disabilities Endorsement program. In 2024, the college launched a Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling degree.

==Campus==

Alma College is located in a small-town setting, the city of Alma having slightly fewer than 10,000 residents. Its primary academic buildings, built with a red brick motif, are centered around a large square, McIntyre Mall. West of this mall is picturesque Thomas Andison Chapel.

The majority of buildings are located on North Campus, that is, the area north of Superior Street. These include the major dormitory residences, as well as the academic and student life buildings. South Campus is home to suite-style residences (&quot;New Dorms,&quot; so named because they were built later in the 1960s than residences in North Campus) as well as the new environmentally friendly apartment-style Wright Hall, inaugurated in 2005 and the second residence of its name, the former being demolished in 1976. South Campus is also home to &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; (Center Street) and &quot;Sorority Row&quot; (Superior Street) as well as several other themed houses. More than half of the buildings on Alma&#x27;s campus were built under the long tenure (1956–1980) of Robert D. Swanson, after whom the main academic building is named.

The Dow Science Center, renovated in 2018, features the Rollin M. Gerstacker Science and Technology Suite, as well as the Dow Digital Science Center (DDSC). These spaces offer academic student study space, large screen monitors for showing remote projects in real time, dedicated computer work stations, a large conference room designed for distance room and a seminar room. The DDSC sponsors summer camps for elementary, middle and high school students in the area.

The college in 2019 dedicated the Wright Leppien Opera House Block, a historic structure in downtown Alma which had been gutted by a fire almost a decade earlier. &quot;The Opera House,&quot; as it is locally known, was historically considered to be the main local venue for numerous theatrical productions, concerts and public lectures. Today, it is used for student housing and special events.

The college in 2023 opened the Greg Hatcher Learning Commons, a $14-million renovation of its preexisting library into a new facility, which serves as both a library and a student union.

In addition to the main campus, the college also owns a ecological research area containing woodlands, a willow marsh, a sphagnum bog, and a glacial kettle lake, with a full research facility and a bird observatory, located in Vestaburg, about west of Alma.

==Athletics==

Generally, more than half (52.4%) of Alma&#x27;s students participate in sports. In December 2021, the college announced the addition of women&#x27;s wrestling bringing the total number of sports offered up to 12 men&#x27;s NCAA and 12 women&#x27;s NCAA, plus co-ed esports and women&#x27;s bowling, competitive cheer, dance, and STUNT.

The mascot of Alma College is Scotty. He wears a traditional highland Kilt, sporran, and sash woven in the Alma College tartan pattern.

Prior to 1934, the Alma mascot was the Fighting Presbyterians. This became the subject of debate in 1931 due to a series of stories by The Almanian, a student-run newspaper, expressing discontent over the limitation on cheers to &quot;Go Presbyterians&quot; or &quot;Go Campbellites,&quot; the latter in support of the football coach, Royal Campbell.

==Performing arts==
More than a third of all Alma students take part in at least one performance each year. The college offers majors in theatre, dance and music, but students of all majors may join in productions. The Heritage Center for the Performing Arts is the region&#x27;s premiere performing arts facility. It houses the Theatre and Dance Department, and serves as the performance venue for the college&#x27;s eight music ensembles. It features a 500-seat concert hall for large performances, an intimate 190-seat theatre, and a dance studio.

==Greek life==
Several social Greek letter organizations are active on the Alma College campus. There are five social fraternities: Zeta Sigma, Delta Gamma Tau, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Chi, and Tau Kappa Epsilon. There are five social sororities: Kappa Iota Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Xi Delta, Gamma Phi Beta, and Phi Sigma Sigma. Other Greek organizations on campus include Sigma Alpha Iota, a women&#x27;s music fraternity, and Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed National Service Fraternity, in addition to numerous honorary and professional fraternities.

==Model United Nations==
Alma College is home to one of the most successful Model United Nations (MUN) programs in the United States. Since the mid-1990s, Alma has received 58 “outstanding delegation” awards at the MUN Midwest Regional Competition and 52 at the National MUN Conference in New York City — the most of any college or university in the 95-year history of the conference. The Alma College MUN program was used as a clue on a 2017 episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; In a 2012 article, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; referred to the Alma College MUN program as &quot;an unlikely superpower.&quot;

<text>The Chitina River (Ahtna Athabascan Tsedi Na’ &lt; &quot;tsedi&quot; &quot;copper&quot; + &quot;na’&quot; &quot;river&quot;) is a tributary of the Copper River in the U.S. state of Alaska. It begins in the Saint Elias Mountains at the base of Chitina Glacier and flows generally northwest through the Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve to meet the smaller river near Chitina. The watershed was once a major copper mining region.

==Recreation==
The Chitina River is suitable for floating in rafts, kayaks, and decked canoes by boaters with sufficient wilderness and whitewater skills. From a put-in place near Hubert&#x27;s Landing, slightly downstream of Chitina Glacier, the river is Class II (medium) on the International Scale of River Difficulty all the way to the mouth at Chitina.

Boaters starting from Hubert&#x27;s Landing will have to make a difficult portage to reach the main river channel. It is also possible to put in at Jake&#x27;s Bar, about halfway between the glacier and the river mouth. The shorter trip requires no portage.
Hazards include cold silty water, bad weather, and the remote location. Grizzlies pose a danger to boaters, especially near the mouths of clear tributaries, where the bears tend to congregate. A variety of salmon, attractive to bears, migrate to and from these tributaries.

==Tributaries==
The most important tributaries of the Chitina are from the north and emanate principally from the south slope of the Wrangell Mountains; in order downstream they are Nizina, Lakina, Gilahina, and Kuskulana rivers. From the south the main affluents are the Tana, Chakina, and Tebay rivers, which rise in the Chugach Mountains. Kiagna River is also a southern tributary of Chitina River.

The Tebay River, and an associated set of lakes and smaller streams in the Tebay watershed, offer &quot;the potential for some of the finest wilderness angling experiences to be had in Southcentral Alaska&quot;, according to &quot;Alaska Fishing&quot;. The main game fish in the Tebay system are rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling.

<doc id="991444" wikidata="Q3297167" url="?curid=991444" title="Bob O. Evans">
<text>Bob Overton Evans (August 19, 1927 – September 2, 2004), also known as &quot;Boe&quot; Evans, was an American computer pioneer and corporate executive at IBM (International Business Machines). He led the groundbreaking development of compatible computers that changed the industry.

==Early life and education==

Evans was born in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1951, after earning an engineering degree from Iowa State University, he joined IBM as a junior engineer.

==Career==
Bob O. Evans joined IBM in a low level engineering position in
1951
as it was developing a new range of &quot;computers&quot; based on vacuum tubes (earlier IBM computers used mechanical
switches). A natural and very
capable manager he moved up the company hierarchy to the position of vice president (development) in
the Data Systems division in 1962. This was apparently created as a position where he had responsibility for the
development of &quot;System/360&quot;, a merger of IBMs separate scientific and business computing systems.
In the early 1960s, Evans persuaded IBM’s chairman, Thomas J. Watson Jr., to discontinue the company’s development of a hodgepodge of incompatible computers and instead to embark on the development of a single product line of general-purpose, compatible computers. Until then, researchers thought that the fields of scientific computing and commercial data processing each required their own type of special-purpose computer. Compatibility would ensure that the same software could run on any model of the product line, avoiding a re-programming of software.

Evans had overall responsibility for the hardware and software development of what was announced on April 7, 1964, as the IBM System/360 product line, with six models (later gradually expanded to 18 models) and a performance range factor of 50. IBM – in 1964 a company with an annual revenue of $3.2 billion – invested more than $5 billion in engineering, factories and equipment to develop and manufacture System/360, opening five plants and hiring 60,000 employees. In the lead article about System/360 in the &quot;IBM Journal of Research and Development&quot;, April 1964, only Evans was acknowledged by name, in these words: “The scope of the compatibility objective and of the whole System/360 undertaking was largely due to B. O. Evans, Data Systems Division Vice President–Development.”

After a stint as president of IBM’s Federal Systems Division, in 1969 Evans was named president of IBM’s Systems Development Division (SDD). He was responsible for the development of what was announced on June 30, 1970 as the IBM System/370 product line, initially with three models, later gradually expanded to 17 models. The hardware was supported by four main operating systems. Any application that had run on System/360 could run on System/370. Equally important, where most of the processing on System/360 had been batch-oriented, with only the beginnings of interactive processing, new features of the System/370 opened the door to explosive growth in online transaction processing.

SDD and a successor, the Systems Communications Division, also with Evans as its president, developed a communications architecture and a set of architecture-compliant communication product lines that were announced in 1974 under the banner of Systems Network Architecture (SNA). In today’s ocean of the Internet Protocol, there still are thousands of SNA islands in productive existence.

Evans was also responsible for IBM’s Future Systems (FS) project. The project was terminated in 1975, in part because of anticipated software incompatibilities between FS and 360/370. On another front, IBM each year was doubling its shipments of online workstations, a market segment it had created around the IBM 3270 display system. Competition was starting to do better, and IBM began to lose market share in one of its &quot;own&quot; segments.

In 1977 IBM named Evans senior vice president for engineering, programming, and technology. He left IBM in 1984. From 1981 until 1995, Evans was chief scientific advisor to the government in Taiwan. From 1984 on, he was a partner of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, and managing partner of Technology Strategies and Alliances. The latter company merged and became Rocket Ventures, of which he was a partner.

Evans died in Hillsborough, California, on September 2, 2004.

==Legacy and honors==
In a White House ceremony in 1985, Bob Evans and his colleagues, Fred Brooks (responsible for System/360 architecture and design) and Erich Bloch (responsible for System/360 technology) received the National Medal of Technology “for their contributions to […] the IBM System/360, a computer system and technologies which revolutionized the data processing industry.”

*In 1970, Evans was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.
*In 1991, he received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Computer Pioneer Award, for the development of compatible computers.
*In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum, “for excellence in management of computer systems, hardware, and software development projects, including the IBM System/360, which revolutionized the computer industry.”

<text>Théodule-Armand Ribot (18 December 18399 December 1916) was a French psychologist. He was born at Guingamp, and was educated at the Lycée de St Brieuc. He is known as the founder of scientific psychology in France, and gave his name to Ribot&#x27;s Law regarding retrograde amnesia.

In 1856 he began to teach, and was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure in 1862.

He passed his agrégation in philosophy, this allowed him to teach in high school. He worked as a high school teacher in Vesoul (1866–1868), and then in Laval (1868–1872).

On the 9 April 1888 at The Collège de France he gave the first lecture in psychology in France.

In 1885 he gave a course of lectures on Experimental Psychology at the Sorbonne, and in 1888 was appointed professor of that subject at the College of France. His thesis for his doctors&#x27; degree, republished in 1882, &quot;Hérédité: étude psychologique&quot; (5th ed., 1889), was his most important and best known book.

L&#x27;Hérédité psychologique is considered to have introduced Darwinian and Spencerian evolutionary ideas to France.

Following the experimental and synthetic methods, he brought together a large number of instances of inherited peculiarities. He paid particular attention to the physical element of mental life, ignoring all spiritual or nonmaterial factors in man. In his work on &quot;La Psychologie anglaise contemporaine: l&#x27;école expérimentale&quot; (1870), he showed his sympathy with the sensationalist school, and again in his translation of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot;.

Ribot was in 1889 the co-president (with Jean-Martin Charcot) of the first international congress for experimental psychology and in 1890 the president for the fourth congress. From the first 12 such international congresses, the International Union of Psychological Science eventually emerged.

Besides numerous articles, he wrote on Arthur Schopenhauer, &quot;Philosophie de Schopenhauer&quot; (1874; 7th ed., 1896), and on the contemporary psychology of Germany (&quot;La Psychologie allemande contemporaine&quot;, 1879; 13th ed., 1898), also four little monographs on &quot;Les Maladies de la mémoire&quot; (1881; x3th ed., 1898); &quot;De la volonté&quot; (1883; 14th ed., 1899); &quot;De la personnalité&quot; (1885; 8th ed., 1899); and &quot;La Psychologie de l&#x27;attention&quot; (1888), which supplied useful data to the study of mental illness.

In 1896 he introduced the term Anhedonia describing the inability to feel pleasure.

<doc id="991454" wikidata="Q250449" url="?curid=991454" title="Alpha-mannosidosis">
<text>Alpha-mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder, first described by Swedish physician Okerman in 1967. In humans it is known to be caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation in the gene MAN2B1, located on chromosome 19, affecting the production of the enzyme alpha-D-mannosidase, resulting in its deficiency. Consequently, if both parents are carriers, there will be a 25% chance with each pregnancy that the defective gene from both parents will be inherited, and the child will develop the disease. There is a two in three chance that unaffected siblings will be carriers (Figure 1). In livestock alpha-mannosidosis is caused by chronic poisoning with swainsonine from locoweed.

==Symptoms and signs==

Alpha-mannosidosis is a lifelong multi-systemic progressive disease, with neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over decades. The timing of the appearance of symptoms correlates with the severity of the disease. The onset of the most severe form of the disease occurs within the first months of life and involves skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability, with rapid progression leading to death from primary central nervous system involvement or myopathy. However, most neonates with lysosomal storage disorders are asymptomatic and only rarely severely affected. This delays diagnosis, particularly as milder forms of the disease involve only mild to moderate intellectual disability, which progresses gradually during childhood or adolescence.

The first decade of life is characterised by the development of hearing impairment, psychomotor delay, recurrent infections, especially upper airway infections, pulmonary infections and acute/serous otitis media infections. Significant changes in a number of facial features may occur, such as protruding forehead, flattened nasal bridge, small nose, wide mouth, and widely spaced teeth. Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build-up of storage materials in the muscle.

==Pathophysiology==

A defective alpha-mannosidase enzyme, which normally helps to break down complex sugars derived from glycoproteins in the lysosome, causes progressive lysosomal accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in all tissues, resulting in impaired cellular function and apoptosis (Figure 2). Complete absence of functionality in this enzyme leads to death during early childhood due to deterioration of the central nervous system. Enzymes with low residual activity lead to a milder form of the disease, with symptoms such as impaired hearing, cognitive impairment, susceptibility to bacterial infections, and skeletal deformities. The course of the disease is progressive.

Depending on the severity of the disease, alpha-mannosidosis has been classified into three proposed subtypes, based on severity and age of onset.
* Type 1: A mild form, recognized after age ten years, with absence of skeletal abnormalities, muscle problems (myopathy), and slow progression
* Type 2: A moderate form, recognized before age ten years, with presence of skeletal abnormalities, myopathy, and slow progression. This is the most common form
* Type 3: A severe form, leading to early death from progressive central nervous system involvement
However, given the variety of mutations that have been documented, and the broad range and severity of symptoms, the disease is considered clinically as a continuum.

==Diagnosis==
Alpha-mannosidosis is a progressive disorder, and its presence should be suspected in patients with cognitive disabilities, skeletal changes (e.g., swollen joints, curved spine), hearing loss and recurrent infections. Although children with the condition are often born seemingly normal, their condition deteriorates with age. Alpha-mannosidosis can impact a patient&#x27;s quality of life in many ways, including their ability to live independently, socialise or find employment.

Generally, phenotypes of alpha-mannosidosis patients are not clearly distinguishable, which makes a prediction of the clinical course for an individual patient challenging. Patients may present to doctors, nurses or health visitors at different stages of progression, and with different &quot;ad hoc&quot; symptoms, making the link to suspect a diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis difficult. The main symptoms can also be shared with those of other lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucopolysaccharidosis.

Given the progressive nature of the disease, the earlier a correct diagnosis is achieved the better. The condition is often diagnosed and treated using a multi-disciplinary approach, involving paediatricians, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, otologists, neurologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons and physiotherapists.

A diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis is suspected based upon identification of characteristic findings of a multi-symptomatic presentation, a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and results from the diagnostic tests described below:
* Oligosaccharides in urine: A preliminary investigation may be performed to measure mannose-rich oligosaccharide concentrations in urine. Elevated urinary excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides is suggestive, but not diagnostic of the disease.
* Acid alpha-mannosidase activity: Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring residual alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells &quot;via&quot; a fluorometric assay. This is the most reliable diagnostic method, along with genetic testing.
* Genetic testing: Identification of disease-causing mutations is achieved using DNA from peripheral blood cells, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 24 MAN2B1 exons, followed by DNA sequencing.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for congenital alpha-mannosidosis, and in general, the approach to management is proactive, with the aim of preventing emerging complications. After a full physical examination, physicians should focus on the known complications of alpha-mannosidosis, such as hydrocephalus, otitis media, hearing loss, dental caries, joint symptoms, kyphoscoliosis, and mental state. Treatment is often limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of the condition by, for example, medications to control seizures, hearing aids to ameliorate hearing loss, and routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness. In some cases, a wheelchair may be appropriate if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a treatment option for some patients, however the risk-benefit profile is more favourable in younger patients, therefore ensuring an early diagnosis is critical for this to be a viable option. The rationale is that enzyme-producing donor cells repopulate the host tissue and transfer enzyme to nearby enzyme-deficient host cells. Despite early reports to the contrary, The possible benefits of HSCT must be weighed against the overall risk of procedure related morbidity and mortality. The benefits are greater in younger patients before complications have developed, and also transplant related complications are more frequent and severe in older patients.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a therapeutic alternative in a number of lysosomal storage diseases. The overall principle of ERT is that a recombinantly produced version of the deficient enzyme is introduced into the blood stream, from where it is internalised by the cells and reaches the lysosomes by mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated uptake, thus replacing the missing endogenous enzyme. An ERT with velmanase alfa is approved for use in the European Union and the US.

==Prognosis==
The long-term forecast for the condition is poor. There is generally a slow progression of neuromuscular and bone changes over decades. Behavioural problems or psychiatric disorders may also be present. The life expectancy in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders may survive well into adult life.

Independent living will be difficult, and patients with alpha-mannosidosis may become socially isolated, and during the late stages of the disease they may become wheelchair-using, as they can no longer walk unaided. This is likely to have a negative impact upon the quality of life of caregivers and family members.

==Epidemiology==

The worldwide incidence of alpha-mannosidosis is not known exactly. However, a number of reports from different countries estimate that it occurs in approximately one in every million babies born worldwide. Mannosidosis is found in all ethnic groups in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia.

<text>Ronald Reinhold Schuler is a Canadian politician. He is currently a member of the Manitoba Legislature and a representative of the Progressive Conservative Party (PCs). He was first elected in the 1999 provincial election. and was re-elected in the 2003, 2007, 2011, 2016, 2019 and 2023 elections.

After the PCs won control of the Manitoba government in the 2016 election, Premier of Manitoba Brian Pallister appointed Schuler Minister of Crown Services. On August 17, 2017 he was named Minister of Infrastructure. On December 30, 2021, Premier Heather Stefanson removed Schuler from cabinet for persistently refusing to reveal whether he was vaccinated against COVID-19.

==Personal life and education==
Schuler was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He attended John M. King Elementary School, before moving to Benton Harbor, Michigan, where he attended Millburg Elementary School in Berrien County. In 1976, he moved back to Winnipeg, where he attended Elmwood Junior High and graduated from Elmwood High School in 1981. He is the youngest son of Wanda and Reinhold Schuler, with four sisters and one brother.

Schuler obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Manitoba in 1987, with a major in international relations and a minor in sociology. He was a junior executive at the T. Eaton Company from 1979 to 1984. Schuler went on to become a small business owner, co-owning Christmas Traditions, Espresso Junction Inc., and Gingerbread World Inc. He also served as Chair of the Manitoba Intercultural Council from 1991 to 1993.

==School board service==
On October 25, 1995, Schuler began his political career when he was elected as a school trustee for Ward Three in the River East School Division.

In his first term on the River East School Board, Schuler served as Chairman of the Education and Policy Committee. He advocated a zero violence tolerance policy on issues affecting the safety of students and staff. Schuler strongly supported increased technology funding and division-wide upgrades to classroom computers and also strongly supported heritage language programs offered in the divisions.

He was re-elected on October 28 as a school trustee for the River East School Division, Ward Three in the 1998 election. Schuler’s re-election led him to being appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board of Trustees in November 1998. He resigned from his position as school trustee on September 23, 1999 to pursue his career in provincial politics with the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba.

==Legislative service==
Schuler was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the provincial election held on September 21, 1999, defeating New Democrat Leonard Kimakovich by 4969 votes to 4058 in the constituency of Springfield.

During Schuler’s first term as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Gary Filmon, Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, appointed Schuler as the PC Caucus Labour &amp; Immigration Critic.

The voters of Springfield re-elected Schuler as their MLA on June 3, 2003 by a much greater margin, though the PCs incurred a net loss of four seats across Manitoba. Stuart Murray appointed Schuler as the PC Caucus Critic for Energy, Science and Technology, and the Chief Critic for the Kyoto Accord, the Civil Service Commission, and Lotteries and Gaming.

2003 Manitoba provincial election: Springfield

On February 24, 2006, Schuler announced that he would seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. Hugh McFadyen won the leadership election on April 29, 2006.

2006 Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba leadership election

For a third consecutive term, Schuler was re-elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Springfield on May 22, 2007.

In September 2007, Schuler was appointed Critic for Education, Citizenship and Youth, as well as Caucus Whip by Leader Hugh McFadyen. As of February 4, 2010, Schuler is the Critic for Housing and Community Development and Sports.

Schuler held several critic portfolios during his time in Opposition, including Labour and Immigration, Energy, Science and Technology, Kyoto Accord, the Civil Service Commission, Lotteries and Gaming, Education, Citizenship &amp; Youth, Community Economic Development Fund, Housing and Community Development and Sports, as well as Caucus Whip.

Schuler was re-nominated to represent the Progressive Conservative Party in the 2011 Manitoba provincial election, held on October 4, in the newly created constituency of St. Paul and won re-election.

<text>A hopper crystal is a form of crystal, the shape of which resembles that of a pyramidal hopper container.

The edges of hopper crystals are fully developed, but the interior spaces are not filled in. This results in what appears to be a hollowed out step lattice formation, as if someone had removed interior sections of the individual crystals. In fact, the &quot;removed&quot; sections never filled in, because the crystal was growing so rapidly that there was not enough time (or material) to fill in the gaps. The interior edges of a hopper crystal still show the crystal form characteristic to the specific mineral, and so appear to be a series of smaller and smaller stepped down miniature versions of the original crystal.

Hoppering occurs when electrical attraction is higher along the edges of the crystal; this causes faster growth at the edges than near the face centers. This attraction draws the mineral molecules more strongly than the interior sections of the crystal, thus the edges develop more quickly. However, the basic physics of this type of growth is the same as that of dendrites but, because the anisotropy in the solid–liquid inter-facial energy is so large, the dendrite so produced exhibits a faceted morphology.

Hoppering is common in many minerals, including lab-grown bismuth, galena, quartz (called skeletal or fenster crystals), gold, calcite, halite (salt), and water (ice).

In 2017, Frito-Lay filed for (and later received) a patent for a salt cube hopper crystal. Because the shape increases surface area to volume, it allows people to taste more salt compared to the amount actually consumed.

<text>Wainfleet is a rural township in southern Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada.

There is a small and growing tourist industry, near and on Lake Erie at the southern area of Wainfleet called Long Beach. Wainfleet is also the home of the Marshville Heritage Village, a living history museum, recreating life in Ontario c. 1850–1910.
== Communities ==
The township includes the communities of Attercliffe, Beckett&#x27;s Bridge, Belleview Beach, Burnaby, Camelot Beach, Chambers Corners, Long Beach, Morgan&#x27;s Point, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge, Ostryhon Corners, Perry, Wainfleet (known until the 1920s as Marshville), Wellandport (which straddles the border with the neighbouring Township of West Lincoln), Willow Bay and Winger. Wainfleet is near Willow Bay. The administrative offices of the township are located in Wainfleet.

==Coat of arms==
Wainfleet Township&#x27;s coat of arms consists of a white shield depicting a red cross, which symbolizes the arms of Lincoln, England, with a maple leaf in its centre. The maple leaf represents Canada and divides the shield into four quarters. Two of the quarters are filled with blue wavy lines symbolizing water. A third section contains a wagon wheel, and the other a harrow. The Harrow represents development of agriculture in the area. A cranberry bush crown on the coat of arms is indicative of the natural flora in Wainfleet.

Anglo-Saxon meaning of Wain &quot;a wagon&quot; and Fleet &quot;a creek - a river&quot; is &quot;a creek through which a wagon can pass.&quot;

Two men stand on either side of the coat of arms: a Mississauga native who represents the tribe that settled a long Lake Ontario and a Franciscan Priest who represents Father Daillon, the first European among the priests that established the settlement in 1626–1678.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Wainfleet had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

This population is diverse in age: the largest population bracket is the 45-49 age range with 595 residents, and the smallest is 85 and older with only 65 residents.

==People==
Tony Dekker, singer/songwriter/guitarist for indie folk band Great Lake Swimmers, grew up on a farm in Wainfleet. A&amp;E Network personality Tanya Memme is also a native of Wainfleet.

<text>The Sokol movement (, &quot;falcon&quot;) is an all-age gymnastics organization first founded in Prague in the Czech lands of Austria-Hungary in 1862 by Miroslav Tyrš and Jindřich Fügner. It was based upon the principle of &quot;a strong mind in a sound body&quot;. Sokol, through lectures, discussions, and group outings, provided what Tyrš viewed as physical, moral, and intellectual training for the nation. This training extended to men of all ages and classes, and eventually to women.

The movement also spread across all the regions populated by Slavic cultures, most of them part of either Austria-Hungary or the Russian Empire: present-day Slovakia, the Slovene Lands, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland (Polish Sokół movement), Ukraine, and Belarus. In many of these nations, the organization also served as an early precursor to the Scouting movements. Though officially an institution &quot;above politics&quot;, Sokol played an important part in the development of Czech nationalism and patriotism, which found expression in articles published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in Sokol libraries, and theatrical performances at the gymnastic mass festivals called &quot;slets&quot;.

==Early history==
The idea for physical training centers was not a new one. The Sokol movement consciously traced its roots in physical education to the athletes and warriors of Ancient Greece. More directly, the nature of the Sokol was influenced by the German Turnverein, mass-based, nationalist-minded gymnastics societies founded by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in 1811.

Miroslav Tyrš, the founder of the first Sokol in Prague in 1862, continued as the most influential figure in the movement until his death in 1884. Born Friedrich Emanuel Tirsch into a German-speaking family in 1834, Tyrš grew up under the influence of the Romantic nationalism that gave rise to the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848. He received a thorough education at the University of Prague, where he majored in philosophy. It was not until the early 1860s that he became involved in the Czech nationalist cause, and changed his name to the Slavic form. After he failed to find a position in academia, Tyrš combined his experience working as a therapeutic gymnastics trainer with the nationalist ideologies he had been exposed to in Prague: the first Sokol club was formed.

The first Sokol worked to develop new Czech terminology for the training exercises, which centred on marching drills, fencing, and weightlifting. They designed a uniform that was a mélange of Slavic and revolutionary influences: brown Russian trousers, a Polish revolutionary jacket, a Montenegrin cap, and Garibaldi redshirt. A Sokol flag, red with a white falcon, was designed by the writer Karolína Světlá (and painted by Czech artist Josef Mánes).

The Prague Sokol initially drew its leaders from the ranks of politicians and its members from the petite bourgeoisie and the working classes. The first president was Jindřich Fügner, an ethnic German who was a member of the Czech cause. Most founders were also members of the Young Czechs party, the most influential including Prince Rudolf von Thurn-Taxis, Josef Barák, and Julius and Eduard Grégr. The authorities of Austria-Hungary continually kept a close eye on the movement, but the reputation and prestige of the Sokol continued to grow; soon the Sokol members were known by most as the &quot;Czech national army&quot;.

==1860s and 1870s: Initial growth, militarization, and internal problems==
Within the first year the Sokols expanded beyond Prague, first into the Moravia and the Slovenian regions of the Habsburg empire. Initially the majority of members were students and professionals, but over time there was a trend towards increasingly working class members.

The Sokol training went through periods of greater militarized training, during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, when Sokol members were hired as guards for public events. This militaristic side of the Sokol movement continued to resurface throughout its history.

The internal issues that were to plague the Sokol movement over the years emerged almost immediately. These internal arguments reached fruition during the 1870s with the power struggle in leadership between the members of Old Czechs and the Young Czechs parties. Theoretically, the Sokol was a society “above politics.” Always flamboyantly nationalistic, the more conservative members of the Sokol argued that the organization should maintain its distance from politics while the Young Czech members advocated more direct political participation. Theoretically, the Sokol was also open equally to members of all classes. The informal “thou” (&quot;ty&quot;) was used by all members, but there were constant arguments over whether this was necessary or not. Different leaders believed that the Sokol was a mass-based institution defined by its working class members, while others viewed it more as a middle class apparatus by which to educate and raise the national consciousness of the working classes.

==1880s: Slets and Sokol union==
In 1882, the first slet was held. &quot;Slet&quot; came from the Czech word for &quot;a flocking of birds&quot; (Czech plural: ) since the organization carried the name for falcon, Sokol. The same word, &quot;slet&quot;, exists or can be synthesized from common Slavic roots in other Slavic languages. It meant a mass gymnastics (1572 Sokols) festival that became a grand tradition within the Sokol movement that spread across Central Europe together with other Slavic movements such as the political movement of Pan-Slavism. The first and subsequent slets included an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the train station, mass demonstrations, gymnastics competitions, speeches, and theatrical events, open to members of all Sokols.

In 1887 the Habsburg authorities finally allowed, after over twenty years worth of proposals, the formation of a union of Sokol clubs – Czech Sokol Community (&quot;Česká obec sokolská&quot;, ČOS). The union centralized all the Sokols in the Czech lands and sent Sokol trainers to the rest of the Slavic world to found Sokol institutions in Kraków, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo and even the Russian Empire (FC Spartak Moscow) (mostly the Ukrainian lands).

In 1889, though officially forbidden by the authorities, members of the Prague Sokol went to the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. There they won several medals and established strong connections with French gymnasts and the French public. The Sokols have been credited with establishing the beginning of the strong French sympathy for the Czechs and their subsequent political alliances on this trip.

==1890s: The progressive era==
The 1890s were a progressive era for the Sokols. In order to encourage a wider range of participation, the Sokols reformed their programs, offering training sessions of varying intensities, extending their libraries, emphasizing the educational aspect of training, and starting programs for adolescents, youth, and women. There was an increasing focus on mass-based ideology and working class egalitarianism under the leadership of the Young Czechs, namely Jan Podlipný, who was also the mayor of Prague 1897–1900.

The second slet was held in 1891 (over 5,000 Sokols) and the third one soon afterwards in 1895. At this third slet the congress of the Sokol union laid out its progressive new trajectory in the St. Wenceslas Day (September 28) Resolutions. The leaders chose to continue to provide more accessible forms of training, with less focus on competition and more on an egalitarian idea of people&#x27;s gymnastics balancing mental as well as physical education.

==1900–1914: Competitors and neo-Slavism==
The rise of the Social Democrats and agrarian parties in the political arena played out in Sokol politics as well as national ones. The Social Democrats formed a rival gymnastics society, the (&quot;Dělnická tělovýchovná jednota&quot;, DTJ). Václav Kukař, a powerful ČOS figure, developed the policy of &quot;cleansing&quot; (&quot;očištění&quot;) and sought to limit membership to those who he believed demonstrated commitment to purely Czech causes. Most of the progressive members of the Sokols were purged or left voluntarily to join the DTJ. Another rival gymnast society was founded by the Christian Social Party under the name Orel (&quot;Eagle&quot;). In the face of such competition, the Sokols set about reaffirming their traditional mission under the leadership of Josef Scheiner.

The fourth slet, held in 1901 (11,000 Sokols), boasted a large international participation, including Galician Poles, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Croats, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs, as well as Frenchmen and Americans. This slet also marked the first appearance of women who grew to be a major part of Sokol members in the following decades.

The fifth slet, held in 1907 (over 12,000 Sokols), had an increasingly Slavic focus and moved away from the more egalitarian idea of people&#x27;s gymnastics with increased competition aspects. It marked the creation of the Federation of Slavic Sokols under the neo-Slavic idea of the Czechs as the strongest Slavic nation, second only to Russia.

At the 1910 meeting of the ČOS congress the sokols reaffirmed their intentions to remain &quot;above politics&quot; and loosened their strict membership rules to allow Social Democrats, though still not clericals, into the sokols.

In 1912, the first &quot;All-Slavic Slet&quot; (&quot;Všeslovanský slet&quot;, over 30,000 Sokols) was held with a largely military atmosphere, causing Augustin Očenášek (a member of Sokol) to remark, &quot;When the thunder comes and the nations rise up to defend their existence, let it be the Sokol clubs from which the cry to battle will sound...&quot;. The cry to battle did sound two years later, when the first rumors of Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination reached the Sokol members, most of whom were attending a regional slet in Brno.

==World War I to Communism: Continued struggle of Czech nationalism==
With the onset of World War I, in 1915 the Sokols were officially disbanded. Many members were active in persuading the Czechs to defect from the Austro-Hungarian army to the Russian side. Sokol members also helped create the Czechoslovak Legions and local patrols that kept order after the disintegration of Habsburg authority, and during the creation of Czechoslovakia in October 1918. They also fulfilled their title as the &quot;Czech national army&quot;, helping to defend Slovakia against the invasion of Béla Kun and the Hungarians.

The Sokol flourished in the early interwar period, and by 1930 had 630,000 members. The Sokols held one last slet (350,000 Sokols) on the eve of the Munich Agreement of 1938 and were later brutally suppressed and banned during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia.

==Sokol society among South Slavs==

The Slovenes organized their own gymnastic society on 1. October 1863 and named it Južni Sokol (South Falcon). Sokol societies were introduced in Slovenia by Viktor Murnik in the last decade of 19th century. V. Murnik was a good gymnast. He was inspired by the Czech Sokol movement and studied Tyrš&#x27;s gymnastics
bases. The 1903 All-Sokols Rally was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The official name of the Slovenian Sokol was Ljubljana Sokol and its starosta was Kajzelj and the coach was Murnik.

In Croatia, the Sokol movement had full support from Josip Juraj Strossmayer, then Bishop of Đakovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, the Croatian Sokol societies were united with the Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.

The Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919–20, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, senior Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that &quot;a brother is dear regardless of his faith&quot;. The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katolička Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church&#x27;s resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926.

In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia all Sokol societies were merged into the Union of Sokols of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as of December 1929. The Eagles were ordered to disband but they rebranded themselves as religious fraternities. This way the Sokol movement was the principal agent of the drive for cultural synthesis of the Yugoslav society. Honorary mayor of the Yugoslav Sokol was Prince Peter II.

In Serbia, the sport club Soko is now known as FK BASK.

==In emigration==

Members of Sokol who emigrated from Czechoslovakia set up small Sokol groups abroad. This Sokol migration, for a variety of reasons, began even before Czechoslovakia became a nation in 1918, intensified as a result of the World Wars and the Communist suppression, and continues to this day. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak immigrants and Czech-American citizens started the American Sokol Organization in St. Louis Missouri in 1865, only three years after the first Prague Sokol. Units quickly formed and by 1878, the United States had 13 Sokol chapters.

A large slet (with well over a thousand participants) was held at the just-opened Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (Century of Progress) at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field on June 25, 1933.

By 1937, American Sokol membership rolls counted nearly 20,000 adults in areas as far-flung as Baltimore, New York City, Nyack, New York, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Oakland, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, St. Louis, Texas, and parts of Canada. Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska, who was of Czech heritage, was a lifelong member of Sokol Omaha.

==Aftermath==
After World War II Sokols held one more &quot;slet&quot; in 1948 before they were once again suppressed, this time by the Communists. The Communist Party tried to replace the tradition of &quot;slets&quot; with mass exercises employed for propaganda purposes: Spartakiad (&quot;spartakiády&quot;) and its organization Czechoslovak Union of Physical Education. Many of the Sokol members were imprisoned or exiled but some took part in the preparation of Spartakiad.

The Sokols reappeared briefly during the Prague Spring of 1968. After years of hibernation, the Sokol movement was revived for the fourth time in 1990. A &quot;slet&quot; was held in 1994 (with 23,000 Sokols participating), after the fall of Communism.

===Currently===
Presently, the organization focuses on physical training in gymnastics and other athletics. Its popularity is, however, well below pre-war levels and a large percentage of members are older people with memories of the pre-1948 Sokol movement. Other members are mainly parents who register their kids for physical activities. A further &quot;slet&quot; was held in 2000 (25,000 Sokols); another was held in July 2006. In July 2012 there was celebration of 150 years of Sokol movement and in July 2018 was the 100 years anniversary of the creation of Czechoslovakia where 13,000 Sokols gathered in Prague. &quot;Slets&quot; are expected to be held every six years.

===United States===

&quot;Slets&quot; are also held in the United States by organizations of Czech (American Sokol Organization) and Slovak (Sokol USA and Slovak Catholic Sokol) descent. The American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA alternate in hosting national &quot;slets&quot; in the United States at 4-year intervals.

The American Sokol Organization most recently hosted the XXIV ASO &quot;Slet&quot; from June 22 through June 25, 2017 in Cedar Rapids, IA. The American Sokol Organization will host the XXV ASO &quot;Slet&quot; in the summer of 2021 in the Chicago, IL suburbs. Sokol USA most recently hosted the XXVI national &quot;slet&quot; from June 29 through July 2, 2011 in Cleveland, Ohio. The Slovak Catholic Sokol delayed their Slets due to the COVID 19 pandemic, resuming again on July 13, 2023.

Sokol USA hosted the XXVII &quot;slet&quot;, commemorating the 120th anniversary of Sokol USA, from June 29 to July 2, 2016 in Pittsburgh, PA.

Regional districts of the American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA also host smaller regional slets on an annual basis.

===Catalonia===
At the beginning of the twentieth century the Sokol movement was introduced in Catalonia and soon was considered as a new tradition. It bore the name of &quot;falcó&quot; (falcon in Catalan) and was influenced by the older tradition of the castellers.

<text>Ballinakill () is a small village in County Laois, Ireland on the R432 regional road between Abbeyleix, Ballyragget and Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. As of the 2016 census, there were 445 people living in Ballinakill.

==History==
In 1606, Sir Thomas Coatch was granted the right to hold a market and fair in the village. The Ballinakill Cattle Fair continued until 1963. In 1611, Ballinakill was acquired by Sir Thomas Ridgeway who invested heavily by building a castle and developing the local area. From 1613 until the Acts of Union, the town was a parliamentary borough, electing two members to the Irish House of Commons.

The town was besieged and plundered by Irish rebels, including the Earl of Castlehaven and Lord Mountgarret, during the 1641 Rebellion. When the castle and town surrendered much was robbed, including cattle, sheep and cloth. Remarkably, this information survives to us through an account from a native American Patagonian from present day southern Argentina/Chile &#x27;but now a Christian&#x27; who had been a servant to Captain Richard Steele for twenty years and lived in Ballinakill.

==Landmarks==

The town square features a monument to men who died in the 1798 rebellion. The monument was erected in 1898. In 1998 a ceremony was held in Ballinakill to mark the bicentenary of the deaths.

Heywood House Gardens, located just north of Ballinakill, is a formal garden on the former Heywood Estate which was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in the early 20th century. The gardens are now managed by the Office of Public Works and open to the public.

==Sport==
Ballinakill GAA and Spink GAA are local Gaelic Athletic Association clubs.

== Transport ==
A daily Town Link service, operated by Slieve Bloom Coaches, routes through the village between Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory. There is also a daily TFI Local Link service, route 822, from Mountrath to Carlow.

== Recreation ==

Ballinakill has an outdoor swimming pool which is operated seasonally from June to September, Masslough lake on the edge of the village, and a playground which opened in 2022.

<text>The Executive Council of British Columbia (the Cabinet) is the Cabinet of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Almost always composed of members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, the Cabinet is similar in structure and role as the federal Cabinet of Canada is to the Canadian House of Commons.

Executive power is vested in the Crown; the lieutenant governor of British Columbia, as representative of the Crown, exercises executive power on behalf of the Cabinet, acting as the lieutenant governor in Council. Members of the Cabinet are selected by the premier of British Columbia, who chairs the Cabinet.

==History==
Prior to their union in 1866, the Executive Councils of the separate crown colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were largely appointed by the governor and included military and judicial officials, their role that of the governor&#x27;s cabinet, similar to the present except that the governor took part in cabinet meetings and political decisions, whereas the modern-day lieutenant governor does not. The colonial Legislative Assemblies were subordinate to the governor and the Council and served more as a sounding-board than a legislative body.

==Cabinet==
The current Cabinet consists of members of the Legislative Assembly representing the province&#x27;s governing party, the British Columbia New Democratic Party. David Eby was sworn in as premier of British Columbia by Lieutenant Governor Janet Austin on November 13, 2024. His cabinet was sworn in on November 18, 2024.

<doc id="991484" wikidata="Q726833" url="?curid=991484" title="Louis J. Mordell">
<text>Louis Joel Mordell (28 January 1888 – 12 March 1972) was an American-born British mathematician, known for his research in number theory. He was born in Philadelphia, United States, in a Jewish family of Lithuanian extraction.

==Education==
Mordell was educated at the University of Cambridge where he completed the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos as a student of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, starting in 1906 after successfully passing the scholarship examination. He graduated as third wrangler in 1909.

==Research==
After graduating Mordell began independent research into particular diophantine equations: the question of integer points on the cubic curve, and special case of what is now called a Thue equation, the Mordell equation

:&quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;k&quot;.

He took an appointment at Birkbeck College, London in 1913. During World War I he was involved in war work, but also produced one of his major results, proving in 1917 the multiplicative property of Srinivasa Ramanujan&#x27;s tau-function. The proof was by means, in effect, of the Hecke operators, which had not yet been named after Erich Hecke; it was, in retrospect, one of the major advances in modular form theory, beyond its status as an odd corner of the theory of special functions.

In 1920, he took a teaching position in UMIST, becoming the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester in 1922 and Professor in 1923. There he developed a third area of interest within number theory, the geometry of numbers. His basic work on Mordell&#x27;s theorem is from 1921 to 1922, as is the formulation of the Mordell conjecture. He was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1928 in Bologna and in 1932 in Zürich and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

He took British citizenship in 1929. In Manchester he also built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in Reinhold Baer, G. Billing, Paul Erdős, Chao Ko, Kurt Mahler, and Beniamino Segre. He also recruited J. A. Todd, Patrick du Val, Harold Davenport and Laurence Chisholm Young, and invited distinguished visitors.

In 1945, he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s, when elected to the Sadleirian Chair, and became Head of Department. He officially retired in 1953. It was at this time that he had his only formal research students, of whom J. W. S. Cassels was one. His idea of supervising research was said to involve the suggestion that a proof of the transcendence of the Euler–Mascheroni constant was probably worth a doctorate. His book &quot;Diophantine Equations&quot; (1969) is based on lectures, and gives an idea of his discursive style. Mordell is said to have hated administrative duties.

==Anecdote==
While visiting the University of Calgary, the elderly Mordell attended the Number Theory seminars and would frequently fall asleep during them. According to a story by number theorist Richard K. Guy, the department head at the time, after Mordell had fallen asleep, someone in the audience asked &quot;Isn&#x27;t that Stickelberger&#x27;s theorem?&quot; The speaker said &quot;No it isn&#x27;t.&quot; A few minutes later the person interrupted again and said &quot;I&#x27;m positive that&#x27;s Stickelberger&#x27;s theorem!&quot; The speaker again said no it wasn&#x27;t. The lecture ended, and the applause woke up Mordell, and he looked up and pointed at the board, saying &quot;There&#x27;s old Stickelberger&#x27;s result!&quot;

<text>Pakistan Railways is the state-owned railway operator in Pakistan. Founded in 1861 as the North Western State Railway and headquartered in Lahore, it owns of operational track across Pakistan, stretching from Peshawar to Karachi, offering both freight and passenger services, covering 482 operational stations across Pakistan.

In 2014, the Ministry of Railways launched &quot;Pakistan Railways Vision 2026&quot;, which seeks to increase PR&#x27;s share in Pakistan&#x27;s transportation sector from 4% to 20%, using the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor rail upgrade. The plan includes building new locomotives, development and improvement of current rail infrastructure, an increase in average train speed, improved on-time performance and expansion of passenger services. The first phase of the project was completed in 2017, and the second phase is scheduled for completion by 2021. Among them is the ML-1 project, which will be completed in three phases at a cost of . Until October 2022, these projects have not started construction or tendering.

Pakistan Railways is an active member of the International Union of Railways. In the 2018/19 financial year, Pakistan Railways carried 70 million passengers. Currently, it is suffering from bad maintenance.

== History ==
In 1855, during the British Raj, several railway companies began laying track and operating in Sindh and Punjab. The country&#x27;s railway system was originally a patchwork of local rail lines operated by small, private companies, including the Scinde Railway, Punjab Railway, Delhi Railway and Indus Flotilla. In 1870, the four companies combined to form the Scinde, Punjab &amp; Delhi Railway. Several other rail lines were soon built, including the Indus Valley State Railway, Punjab Northern State Railway, Sind–Sagar Railway, Sind–Pishin State Railway, Trans–Baluchistan Railway and Kandahar State Railway. These six companies merged with the Scinde, Punjab &amp; Delhi Railway to form the North Western State Railway in 1880. Between 1880 and 1947, the North Western State Railway expanded throughout Punjab and Sindh.

Following the partition of British India and independence of Pakistan in 1947, most of the North Western State Railway infrastructure was in Pakistani territory and was renamed the Pakistan Western Railway. In East Bengal, the portion of the Assam Bengal Railway in Pakistani territory was renamed the Pakistan Eastern Railway. The country adopted of the North Western State Railway; was , was , and was narrow gauge.

In 1954, a branch line was extended from the Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line to Mardan and Charsada. Two years later, the Jacobabad–Kashmore metre-gauge line was converted to broad gauge. The Kot Adu–Kashmore section of the Kotri–Attock Railway Line was built from 1969 to 1973, providing an alternate route from Karachi to northern Pakistan. In 1974, Pakistan Western Railways was renamed Pakistan Railways. In February 2006, the Hyderabad–Khokhrapar Branch Line was converted to . All narrow-gauge tracks in the country were converted to or dismantled during the 2000s. On 8 January 2016, the Lodhran–Raiwind Branch Line double-rail project was completed.

==Structure==

Pakistan Railways is a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Railways (MoR) of the government of Pakistan, tasked with and primarily responsible for planning, administering and establishing passenger rail service and regulating railway companies and industries. Pakistan Railways policy and development are administered by the ministry. From 1947 to 1959, the Pakistan Western Railway and Pakistan Eastern Railway were administered by the Railway Division of the Ministry of Communications, headed by the Director General of Railways (DG Railways) in the ministry. In 1959, an ordinance was passed by Parliament outlining the need for a semi-autonomous railway board. The board was conceived in accordance with the principal powers of the central government as stipulated in the Railways Act IX of 1890. After the first session of the third national assembly, President Muhammad Ayub Khan issued Presidential Order 33 on 9 June 1962. The order directed the transfer of control of both railways (PWR and PER) from the central government to the provincial governments of West Pakistan and East Pakistan, respectively. When PO 33 came into effect on 1 July 1962, railway boards were established by both provinces (repealing the Railway Board Ordinance of 1959).

The presidential order also reinstated the separation convention whereby railway finances were separated from general finances beginning with fiscal year 1961–62, giving each board greater autonomy. In 1974, the Ministry of Railways was created to administer planning, policy-making, technical advice and management of the railway. In 1982, the Ministry of Railways was merged with the Railway Board by a presidential order, resulting in the federal ministry.

=== Railway Board ===
The Railway Board, in existence from 1959 to 2000, was modified with an executive committee from 2000 and 2014. The Railway Board was reconstituted on 20 February 2015. The Board members are:
* Federal Secretary Railways (Chairman of Board)
* Federal Secretary Communications 
* Finance Secretary of Pakistan
* Planning and Development Secretary of Pakistan
* General Manager Railways (Operations)
* General Manager Railways (Manufacturing and Services)
* Member Finance, Ministry of Railways

===Units and divisions===
Pakistan Railways has three functional units: operations, manufacturing and welfare and special initiatives. The operations unit is divided into three main departments. The Infrastructure Department oversees civil engineering, signaling, telecommunications, design and the directorate of property. The Mechanical Engineering Department oversees mechanical engineering, purchasing, stores and electrical engineering, and the Traffic Department oversees passenger facilities, operations, marketing and the directorate of information technology. Several smaller departments, including personnel, railway police, planning, legal affairs, public relations and the Pakistan Railways Academy, are also part of the operations unit. The railway has eight territorial operating divisions: Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Sukkur and Gwadar. Gawadar Division is not yet operational. In addition to these 8 divisions, one division is non operating division which is Mughulpura Division, Lahore. This division is, primarily, engaged with maintenance of rolling stock.

===Pakistan Railways divisions===
The railways has eight regional operating divisions and one non-operating division:

# Pakistan Railways Karachi Division
# Pakistan Railways Sukkur Division
# Pakistan Railways Multan Division
# Pakistan Railways Lahore Division
# Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Division
# Pakistan Railways Peshawar Division
# Pakistan Railways Quetta Division
# Pakistan Railways Gwadar Division (not active yet.)
# Pakistan Railways Mughalpura Division (non-operating division.)
==Rolling stock==

Pakistan Railways has 190 working diesel-electric locomotives. The average life of the fleet is 25 years, and they are serviced at the Pakistan Locomotive Factory.

In January 2016, the railway ordered 800 hopper wagons from Jinan Railway Vehicles Equipment. The first 205 wagons will be built in China, and the remaining 595 wagons will be assembled at the Moghalpura Railway Workshops in Pakistan. The wagons will carry coal to power stations in Karachi and Qadirabad.

==Manufacturing==

The Pakistan Locomotive Factory was built in Risalpur in 1993 at a cost of . The factory&#x27;s capacity is 150 coaches per year on a single-shift basis.

The Moghalpura Railway Workshops, on the Lahore–Wagah Branch Line at Moghalpura Junction railway station (MGPR) in Lahore, are one of several rolling-stock repair sites. The workshop complex emerged at its present site in 1904 to manufacture, repair and overhaul passenger coaches and freight wagons for the North Western State Railway. In 1947, it was the only state-of-the-art workshop for Pakistan Railways. After partition, the Moghalpura Railway Workshops continued to host some 14,000 workers specializing in engineering skills.

The railway owns five concrete sleeper factories in Sukkur, Khanewal, Kohat, Shahinabad and Kotri. The first factory was established in Sukkur in 1967, and the other four factories were opened between 1979 and 1981.

In 2017, 55 additional locomotives (4000 horsepower) manufactured in the United States were added to the Pakistan Railways fleet.

==Network==
===Lines===
The Pakistan Railways network is divided into main lines and branch lines. The Karachi–Peshawar Line is the main north-south line, and the Rohri–Chaman Line is the main east-west line.

====Main lines====
* &quot;Main Line 1 (ML-1)&quot; Karachi–Peshawar Line
* &quot;Main Line 2 (ML-2)&quot; Kotri–Attock Line
* &quot;Main Line 3 (ML-3)&quot; Rohri–Chaman Line
* &quot;Main Line 4 (ML-4)&quot; Quetta–Taftan Line
* &quot;Main Line 5 (ML-5)&quot; Taxila–Khunjerab Line

====Branch lines====
===Tracks===
The Pakistan Railways network comprises 7,791 route-kilometres (7,346 km of broad gauge and 445 km of metre gauge). There are 1,043 km of double-track sections (in total).

The broad-gauge track axle load limit is 22.86 tonnes, except for the Rohri–Chaman Line (limit 17.78 tonnes) and Quetta–Taftan Line (limit 17.27 tonnes). The maximum speed on most lines is , but upgraded sections of the Karachi–Peshawar Line allow speeds up to . In future, Pakistan Railways aim to upgrade all main lines to .
===Electrification===
The Lahore–Khanewal line was electrified at 25 kV AC, but electric service had ceased by 2011. The theft of overhead wire was cited as a reason. The future electrification with 25 kV AC requiring minimum overhead wiring height must be above top of rail and minimum track center spacing must be , and platform height must be no more than above top of rail, to prevent catenary thefts.

===Rail links with adjacent countries===
*Iran – Pakistan Railways is connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways at Zahedan, where a break-of-gauge exists between the Quetta–Taftan Line and the Kerman–Zahedan line. The link was completed on 18 May 2007.
*Afghanistan – Presently there is no rail link to Afghanistan, but Pakistan Railways has proposed to help build an Afghan rail network in three phases. Phase one would stretch from the Chaman to Spin Boldak as an extension of the Rohri–Chaman Line. Phase two would extend the line from Spin Boldak to Kandahar. Phase three would run from Kandahar to Herat and Khushka, Turkmenistan, linking the with the Central Asian . It is unknown where the break-of-gauge station would be. Another proposal would extend the Karachi–Peshawar Line to Kabul via Jalalabad.
*Turkmenistan via Afghanistan – Proposed, avoiding the intervening gauge
*China – There is no present rail link with China. On 28 February 2007, contracts were awarded for feasibility studies on the Taxila–Khunjerab Line, extending it from Havelian via the Khunjerab Pass to the Chinese railhead at Kashgar, a distance of about .
*Turkey – The completion of the Pakistan–Iran link has made it possible, in principle, to run trains between Pakistan and Turkey via Iran. A container train trial service was begun by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani between Islamabad and Istanbul on 14 August 2009. The first train carried 20 containers with a capacity of about , and was scheduled to travel from Islamabad through Tehran to Istanbul. An Istanbul–Tehran–Islamabad passenger rail service has also been proposed. In 2009, Minister for Railways Ghulam Ahmad Bilour expressed the hope that after the container-train trial a passenger train would be introduced. There are also hopes that the route would link Europe and Central Asia and carry passengers.
*India – Two rail links to India exist: the &quot;Thar Express&quot; from Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Karachi and the &quot;Samjhauta Express&quot; from Delhi to Lahore. The more rail links (including reopening) being proposed.
*Russia – Proposed Indian broad-gauge corridors extension via Central Asia

==Service==
===Passenger service===
Passenger traffic is 50 percent of total annual revenue; in 1999–2000, this amounted to . Pakistan Railways carried 52.2 million passengers in 2016 and operates 28 mail, express and passenger trains. The railway carries a daily average of 178,000 people, and provides special trains for Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Independence Day and Raiwind Ijtema. It set up a website during the early 2000s to provide travelers with up-to-date information about seat availability, departures and arrivals. Online ticket purchase was added to the website in 2016, with reservations confirmed by SMS. Wi-Fi service is included on the &quot;Green Line Express&quot;.

====Classes====
Pakistan Railways has several classes of travel. Depending on the route, some trains have one class. Fares for the classes vary, with unreserved seating the least expensive. The following table lists the classes and codes:

== Current Minister of Pakistan Railway ==
Mr. Aamir Ali Baloch, current Senior most officer of Pakistan Railways is the CEO &amp; Sr. General Manager of Pakistan Railways from October 2022, and Shahid Ashraf Tarar is the present Caretaker Minister for Railways. Currently, it has 6 departments and 1 subsidiary.

Pakistan Railways Vision 2026, which was also introduced by the Ministry of Railways, promises to expand PR&#x27;s percentage of Pakistan&#x27;s transportation from 4% to 20%. This plan calls for brand-new developments, locomotives, and renovations. It is a significant and involved railroad organisation member.

===Freight service===
Pakistan Railways was the predominant mode of freight transportation from coastal ports to the interior. At their peak, between 1955 and 1960, PR handled 73 percent of the country&#x27;s freight traffic (compared to less than four percent in 2015). The Freight Business Unit operates over 200 freight stations, including the Port of Karachi and Bin Qasim Port, and several dry ports in Pakistan&#x27;s four provinces. With 12,000 employees, the unit generates revenue from the movement of agricultural, industrial and imported products such as petroleum oil and lubricants, wheat, coal, fertilizer, rock phosphate, cement and sugar from the ports to the interior. On 14 August 2009, Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani launched a freight train between Islamabad and Istanbul via Tehran. The first train carried 20 containers with a capacity of , and made the trip from Islamabad to Tehran and Istanbul in two weeks. In 2015, freight carried by Pakistan Railways increased significantly to 3.3 million tons.

On 22 February 2020, the first cargo train bound for Afghanistan left the Pakistan International Container Terminal in Karachi, with a load of 35 containers. The goods were transported to the city of Chaman, neighbouring Afghanistan, and passed over the border by road.

=== Heritage ===

In Ghangha Pur, a narrow-gauge horse-drawn tramway is operational. It was first opened in 1898, closed in 1998, and re-opened in 2010. and soon abandoned again.

The Khyber train safari is a defunct steam operated train between Peshawar and Attock Khurd. It was first opened in 1925, suspended in 1982, reopened in 1996 as Khyber steam safari, suspended again in 2006 and finally reopened in 2015 with present name and soon abandoned again. A documentary film of the railway featuring its steam locomotives was made by Nick Lera in 1997 with the title Pakistan - Rails to the North West Frontier.

==Accidents and incidents==
Train accidents are common in Pakistan.

*&quot;Sukkur rail disaster&quot;: Occurred on 4 January 1990 in the village of Sangi, near Sukkur in Sindh province. In Pakistan&#x27;s worst rail disaster, 307 people were killed. The &quot;Bahauddin Zakaria Express&quot;, on an overnight run from Multan to Karachi, carried many more passengers in its 16 carriages than its 1,408-seat capacity.

* &quot;Mehrabpur derailment&quot;: The &quot;Karachi Express&quot;, from Karachi to Lahore, derailed near the town of Mehrabpur in Sindh on 19 December 2007. At about 2:25 a.m. local time, fourteen of the train&#x27;s sixteen carriages left the tracks; some were mangled by the crash, and others slid down an embankment into water. Sabotage and terrorism were ruled out as reasons for the derailment, with officials blaming faulty track.
* &quot;2011 Bolan Mail bombing&quot;: On 29 July 2011, five bogies of the &quot;Bolan Mail&quot; coming from Karachi to Quetta were derailed and 300 feet of track damaged as a result of an explosion near the Marri Farm in Dera Allah Yar. The Baloch Republican Army took responsibility for the attack.
* &quot;2012 Bolan Mail collision&quot;: On 16 November 2012, the driver of &quot;Bolan Mail&quot; was injured when the train accidentally collided with another engine near Kotri Railway Station. &quot;Bolan Mail&quot; had a clear signal to proceed, but it struck a halted engine on the same track.
* &quot;2015 Bolan Mail derailment&quot;: On 17 June 2015, several passengers were injured when five cars of the Quetta-bound &quot;Bolan Mail&quot; derailed near Madeji. Cracks in the Dadu Canal dyke had made a hole beneath the track, which resulted in the accident.

* On 17 September 2018, a distressing incident occurred when the Peshawar-bound &quot;Khushhal Khan Khattak Express&quot; derailed in a hilly area between the Massan railway station and Sawan Bridge, approximately 45 km from the location. Seven coaches along with the locomotive were involved in the derailment, resulting in injuries to twenty-one passengers. Rescue 1122 reported that one of the injured passengers was admitted to the Kalabagh tehsil headquarters hospital in critical condition. According to a railways press release, twenty passengers sustained injuries, with four of them being admitted to the Mianwali DHQ hospital for treatment.
* On 17 March 2019, a tragic incident occurred near Nasirabad when the railway track was deliberately blown up, causing five carriages of the Jaffar Express to derail. This resulted in the loss of at least five lives, with eight individuals sustaining injuries. The Jaffar Express was en route to Quetta at the time of the incident. Following the derailment, rescue teams promptly arrived at the scene to assist the victims and transport them to nearby hospitals for medical treatment. The explosion not only caused damage to the railway track but also disrupted the movement of other trains in the area. 
*&quot;Sadiqabad railway accident&quot;: On 11 July 2019, the &quot;Akbar Express&quot; hit a parked cargo train at Walhar railway station, resulting in the death of 21 people and 100 injuries.

The reason behind the derailment as cited by the Railway Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique was strained wooden sleepers.

==Future==
===New lines===
New rail lines have been proposed by Pakistan Railways to connect Gwadar Port to Central Asia, including:
* Karachi–Gwadar Railway Line (Makran Railway)
* Gwadar–Mastung Branch Line
* Basima–Jacobabad Branch Line
* Bostan–Zhob–Dera Ismail Khan Branch Line
* Islamabad–Muzaffarabad Branch Line
* Jhang Sadar–Risalewala Branch Line

===Breaks of gauge===
*In Pakistan: – at Gwadar Port
*Outside Pakistan: – at Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan and – at Kashgar, China

===Track-doubling project===
Over of tracks have been doubled since the track-doubling project began in the 1990s. Sections of the Karachi–Peshawar Line were first doubled, since it was the country&#x27;s busiest and longest line.

====Karachi–Peshawar Line====
*Kiamari–Shahdara Bagh Junction: 
*Chaklala–Golra Sharif Junction: 

====Rohri–Chaman Line====
*Aab-e-Gum–Kolpur: 
*Gulistan–Chaman: 

====Lahore–Wagah Branch Line====
*Lahore Junction–Wagah: 

===Restructuring===
In March 2010, the Pakistani government announced plans to privatise Pakistan Railways and split it into four businesses focusing on passenger operations, freight, infrastructure and manufacturing. In February 2010, &quot;unbundling&quot; was proposed the previous month, with activities being outsourced, privatised, or operated separately. However, complete privatisation has been ruled out.

===Public-private partnership===
Pakistan Railways has faced financial and management crisis, and has met with private operators. Several trains are a public-private partnership. The &quot;Pakistan Business Express&quot; train made its first run on 3 February 2012, and the &quot;Shalimar Express&quot; resumed operation on 25 February of that year.

===China–Pakistan Economic Corridor===
China is involved in the development of Pakistan Railways, and has been increasing its stake in Pakistan&#x27;s communications sector. Freight and passenger service make up 50 percent of the railway&#x27;s total revenue. Pakistan Railways carries 65 million passengers annually and operates 228 mail, express and passenger trains daily. It introduced new mail and express trains between major terminals from 2003 to 2005. The railway has entered developmental agreements with Chinese rail companies. In 2001, Pakistan Railways signed a $91.89 million contract with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation to manufacture 175 high-speed passenger coaches. The project was funded by Exim Bank of China on a supplier-credit basis. Forty passenger coaches have been received, and 105 were scheduled to be assembled in Pakistan Railways&#x27; carriage factory. The coaches are in use on Pakistan Railways&#x27; Rawalpindi–Lahore–Karachi, Lahore–Faisalabad and Rawalpindi–Quetta mail and express trains. The manufacturing kits for the remaining 30 coaches have been received, and 12 are assembled. The technology transfer for the coaches was obtained from China&#x27;s Changchun Car Company.

Pakistan Railways purchased 69 locomotives, 15 of which are in use by the railway, as part of a 2003 agreement with China. The remaining 54 are scheduled to be built at Pakistan Railways&#x27; locomotive factory. The Chinese locomotives are 37 percent less expensive than European locomotives. Although some Pakistani observers have criticised faulty locomotives purchased by Pakistan Railways from Dongfang Electric of China, the railway decided to purchase 45 more 2,000–3,000-horsepower locomotives from Dongfang. The company is willing to redesign the 30 delivered locomotives, strengthening their underframes and reducing their weight below 140 tons each. The Beijing Research and Design Institute is committed to provide 300 rail cars to Pakistan Railways.

According to a 2004 agreement with China National Machinery and Equipment Group, the Chinese company would begin the construction of Corridor 1 of a light-rail mass-transit system in Karachi which is intended to serve four million commuters. The project, costing about $568 million, would take four-and-a-half years to complete. The contract, awarded on a build–operate–transfer basis, consists of five corridors. Pakistan signed a series of agreements with China to expand the capability of its railway system. Under an agreement with China Railway, a Chinese company would provide 1,300 freight cars to Pakistan Railways; 420 would be manufactured in China, and the remaining 880 would be produced at the Moghalpura Railway Workshops in Lahore. In another project, 450 passenger coaches would be rehabilitated at an estimated cost of Rs2.14 billion. This would include air-conditioning 40 coaches, converting 10 power vans and providing 100 high-speed bogies; 30 would be imported from China, and 70 would be manufactured domestically on a transfer-of-technology basis. In a separate agreement, 175 new passenger coaches are being purchased from China.

As part of a $100 million agreement signed by Pakistan and China in November 2001, China is to export 69 locomotives to Pakistan to modernise the country&#x27;s rail fleet. The new engines consume less fuel than older models, and cost less to maintain. The first 15 engines would be manufactured in China, and the remainder would be assembled in Pakistan with Chinese parts and technology. For a Rs7.2 billion project Sindh laying 78,000 tons of rails, China delivered 64,000 tons to Pakistan Railways. In Pakistan’s case, CPEC has continually been discussed ever since its announcement back in 2015, despite the fact that there has not been a major development in years.

;Main Railway Line-1 (ML-1)

The ML-1 railway line project is one of the biggest projects not only of CPEC Phase-II ($6.8 billion) but of Pakistan’s recent history in terms of logistics and communications. Since the partition of British India into India and Pakistan this is the single biggest expansion of the railway system. It spans a total distance of 1,872 km from Karachi to Peshawar. It covers 184 railway stations and carries over 75% of country&#x27;s cargo and passengers.

This will be a kind of revolution in terms of communications and industry. After being upgraded, the railway line will be installed with a computer-based signaling and control system—reducing the epidemic of railway accidents that has been seen across Pakistan. It follows all the international safety procedures and protocols to ensure safe operations of Pakistan Railway.

Main Railway Line-2 (ML-2)

The project is expected to cost approximately $3.4 billion, however, this amount may increase as the project progresses. ML-2 connects southern and northern Pakistan.

Main Railway Line-3 (ML-3)

Projected cost is expected to be in the range of $2-3 billion. ML-3 connects Rohri (Sindh) to Quetta (Balochistan) and is largely focused on enhancing connectivity between the western provinces and the interior regions of Pakistan.

====Karakoram Railway====
Pakistan awarded a Rs72 million (US$1.2 million) contract to an international consortium to conduct a feasibility study for establishing a rail link with China to improve trade between the countries. The study will cover a section between Havellian and the Khunjerab Pass over Mansehra District and the Karakoram Highway. Havellian is already linked with the Pakistani rail network; China would lay about of track in China from Kashgar to the Khunjerab Pass, linking Pakistan with China&#x27;s rail network (largely along the Karakoram Highway). By expanding its stake in Pakistan&#x27;s rail sector, China can utilise the country&#x27;s advantageous geographic position at the confluence of South, Central and West Asia. During the first week of February 2007, Pakistan Railways and Dongfang Electric signed an agreement to establish a rail link between Havellian and Khunjerab. The route from Havellian and Khunjerab will probably include tunnels. The pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2011.

====Gwadar link====
As part of the development plan for its transport and communications network, Pakistan Railways has completed a feasibility study of the Chaman–Kandahar section for laying track between Pakistan and Turkmenistan through Afghanistan. A feasibility study for cost, engineering and design for the construction of a rail link from Gwadar to the existing rail network in Mastung district in Balochistan has been finalised. The link to the port of Gwadar will open underdeveloped areas of Balochistan to development. The chief aim of the venture is to connect the Central Asian republics with Pakistan Railways&#x27; network through Afghanistan.

China will benefit from Gwadar&#x27;s accessible international trade routes to the Central Asian republics and China&#x27;s Xinjiang border region. By extending its east-west railway from the Chinese border city of Kashgar to Peshawar in Pakistan&#x27;s northwest, Beijing can trade freight to and from Gwadar along the shortest route (from Karachi to Peshawar). Pakistan&#x27;s rail network could also supply oil from the Persian Gulf to Xinjiang and give China rail access to Iran.

Pakistan Railways has signed an agreement with two Chinese companies to launch a new app called Railway Automated Booking and Travel Assistance (RABTA). The app aims to provide passengers with a convenient way to manage their tickets, seats, booking, food, hotel and taxi-related matters. The minister for Railways views the initiative as a win-win situation for the department, as the app will also help maintain its income record.
