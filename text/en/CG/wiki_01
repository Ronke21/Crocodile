<text>Kenneth Mars (April 4, 1935 – February 12, 2011) was an American actor. He appeared in two Mel Brooks films: as the deranged Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind in &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967) and Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friedrich Kemp in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974). He also appeared in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; (1972) as well as Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987) and &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; (1991). 

Mars appeared in two seasons of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; as Otto Mannkusser, Francis&#x27;s well-meaning but dimwitted boss and a German immigrant who owns a dude ranch. He voiced King Triton, Ariel&#x27;s father, in the 1989 Disney animated film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and its sequel, as well as its companion television series, and the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. He also did several other animated voice-over film roles such as Littlefoot&#x27;s grandfather in the &quot;Land Before Time&quot; series (1994–2008) and that of Professor Screweyes in &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993), and King Colbert (Prince Cornelius&#x27;s father) in &quot;Thumbelina&quot; (1994). He was also the voice of Tuskernini from &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1992).

==Early life==
Mars was born in Chicago. His father, Bernard &quot;Sonny&quot; Mars, was a radio and television personality. Kenneth studied fine arts and acting at Northwestern University.

==Career==
Mars made his acting debut in 1962 as a book publisher on &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; He later appeared on such television series as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Harry O&quot;, &quot;The Bob Crane Show&quot;, and &quot;Police Woman&quot;. He also appeared in dramatic roles such as Will Turner, a former FBI agent, in Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;The Parallax View&quot;. 
Mars played Harry Zarakartos on the Richard Benjamin-Paula Prentiss 1967 CBS-TV sitcom &quot;He &amp; She&quot;. He was featured in a number of small roles in broadcasts such as the &quot;Misfits of Science&quot; pilot episode and the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Shadowplay&quot;. He was cast opposite Bette Davis in &quot;Hello Mother, Goodbye!&quot;, a 1973 television pilot aired by NBC but never picked up as a series. From 1970 to 1974, Mars guest starred in five episodes of &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, playing various characters.

In 1977, Mars became a series regular on both the &quot;Sha Na Na&quot; variety series and on Norman Lear&#x27;s talk show parody &quot;Fernwood 2-Night&quot; in the recurring role of eccentric William W.D. &#x27;Bud&#x27; Prize, from the Fernwood Chamber of Commerce. He continued the role on the revamped &quot;America 2-Night&quot; in 1978. In 2001, Mars portrayed a comedic famous but washed-up photographer on &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;. Before his death, his final television roles were Otto, the German dude ranch owner on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, an appearance on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, and a reprise of his role as Grandpa Longneck in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; television series.

In 1969, Mars portrayed a marshal trying to raise a posse to pursue &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman. Mars frequently played characters with exaggerated accents. He portrayed German characters in &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967) and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), and played a Croatian musicologist, Hugh Simon, in &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972). His first broadly accented character was that of Sir Evelyn Oakleigh in the 1962 Off-Broadway revival of the Cole Porter musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. He also appeared in the 1962 Broadway play &quot;The Affair&quot;.

In 1975, ABC/Dunhill released a comedy LP produced by Earl Doud, &quot;Henry the First&quot;, featuring Mars in a number of comedy bits as Henry Kissinger, including a cover version of the Bachman–Turner Overdrive song, &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;.

Mars cultivated a lengthy voice acting career, launching it by voicing several characters on &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;. He voiced the roles of Ariel&#x27;s father King Triton in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and in the video games &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II.&quot;

He voiced Littlefoot&#x27;s Grandpa Longneck in The &quot;Land Before Time&quot; series of films and the spin-off television series, and the villainous Professor Screweyes in &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story.&quot; He played some minor roles on the popular radio show, &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot;. He played Sweet William in &quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot;, which took place after &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;. He voiced characters on many animated television series, such as &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;The Biskitts&quot;, &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, as well as video games such as &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

In 2008, Mars retired from acting after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years prior. His final performance was as Grandpa Longneck in the animated television series &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1977, Mars married Barbara Newborn. They had two daughters, Susannah and Rebecca. The marriage lasted until his death in 2011.

==Illness and death==
In 2006, Mars was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that had already spread beyond his pancreas. His cancer made him so ill that he could not reprise his role as King Triton for &quot;The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot;, so Jim Cummings took over the role. As well as being unable to voice Triton, he also could not voice Grandpa Longneck in &quot;The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends&quot;. (Littlefoot&#x27;s Grandpa does appear in the film, but has no lines.) He died on February 12, 2011, at the age of 75.

<doc id="973174" wikidata="Q5242894" url="?curid=973174" title="Day by Day (American TV series)">
<text>Day by Day is an American sitcom television series created by Andy Borowitz and Gary David Goldberg, which aired on NBC from February 29, 1988, to June 4, 1989. It stars Douglas Sheehan, Linda Kelsey, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Thora Birch in her television debut role.

==Synopsis==
The show centers on Brian and Kate Harper, a married couple with two successful careers (Brian as a stockbroker, Kate as a lawyer) and a teenage son named Ross. After the couple had a second child, their daughter, Emily, they decided to quit their jobs because they had missed all the best times of Ross growing up and decided not to make the same mistake with Emily.

With that thought in mind, they decided to open a daycare center in their home. The episodes mixed stories about the daycare center with those about Ross and his friends. At first, Ross wasn&#x27;t too enthusiastic about the idea of his father and mother being at home all the time, because he loved his independence and girl-chasing. He was more than a bit put out with all the bonding his dad wanted to do now.

Louis-Dreyfus played Eileen Swift, their materialistic next-door neighbor who was also once a business associate of Brian&#x27;s. She didn&#x27;t much like the idea of the Harpers running a day care center, and often tried to persuade them both to return to their former careers, always to no avail. Eileen, who was single and childless, was prone to make some very sarcastic quips about the children&#x27;s activities, but Brian and Kate didn&#x27;t let it bother them.

Thorne-Smith played the baby&#x27;s nanny Kristin, who also worked in the daycare center. Kristin was perhaps the reason that Ross relented about his parents running the day care center; he had a crush on her.

&quot;Day by Day&quot; was connected to another NBC series, &quot;Family Ties&quot;. The family patriarch, Brian Harper (played by Sheehan) was a college roommate of Steven Keaton (Michael Gross). A total of 33 episodes were produced.

===&quot;A Very Brady Episode&quot;===
The episode titled &quot;A Very Brady Episode&quot; aired on February 5, 1989, and reunited six cast members from &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; – Ann B. Davis, Florence Henderson, Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland, Maureen McCormick, and Robert Reed.

In this episode, Ross is lectured by Brian and Kate about his poor study habits. Ross&#x27;s explanation that he was watching a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; marathon only angers his parents more, and he is warned to shape up. Ross bemoans his predicament, noting Mike Brady would never yell at him because he had flagging grades.

Ross falls asleep, and finds himself in the opening credits of &quot;The Brady Bunch.,&quot; where he dreams that he is the Bradys&#x27; long-lost son, Chuck. After he gets his hair permed at Mike&#x27;s suggestion, he visits with the various family members (except Greg, Jan, and Cindy), who reprise some of the scenes in the Bradys&#x27; most famous episodes (&quot;Chuck&quot; and Marcia running against each other for class president, &quot;Chuck&quot; being bullied by Buddy Hinton episode, etc.)

After &quot;Chuck&quot; gets some advice about his poor grades from Mike, the family begins to repeat their dialogue. &quot;Chuck&quot; wonders what&#x27;s amiss, and Carol explains what he&#x27;s seeing is a rerun. Everything becomes chaotic and Ross wakes up, vowing to improve his study habits.

Christopher Daniel Barnes, who played Ross on the series, would later portray Greg Brady in &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; and &quot;A Very Brady Sequel.&quot;

<text>Sektor Gaza (, can be translated as a &quot;Gas Sector&quot; or &quot;Gaza Strip&quot;) was a Soviet and Russian punk rock band from Voronezh, founded in 1987 by Yuri Klinskikh.

== History ==
Sektor Gaza was founded in Voronezh by Yuri Klinskikh, also known as Yuri &quot;Khoy&quot;. The group is named after an industrial district of Voronezh nicknamed Sektor Gaza due to its high levels of environmental contamination (also corresponds to the Russian name of Gaza Strip). Sektor Gaza&#x27;s first performance as a group occurred at the local rock club on 9 June 1988, but the group&#x27;s official date of establishment is traditionally given as 5 December 1987, the date of Klinskikh&#x27;s first solo performance of material from Sektor Gaza&#x27;s future repertoire at the Voronezh Rock Club.

In 1989, the group recorded the demo tapes &quot;Plugi-vugi&quot; () and &quot;Kolkhozny pank&quot; ().

In 1990, the group recorded the albums &quot;Zloveshchiye Mertvetsy&quot; () and &quot;Yadryona Vosh&quot; () in a professional recording studio in Voronezh. Klinskikh sold his motorcycle in order to afford to rent the studio.

In 1991, Sektor Gaza made their television debut, appearing on the programs &quot;50x50&quot; and &quot;Programma A&quot; () on the Central Television of the USSR. The music video for &quot;Kolkhozny pank&quot; was shown on the youth program &quot;Do 16 i starshe...&quot; (), contributing to the group&#x27;s fame across the country. In the same year, the group recorded the album &quot;Noch pered Rozhdestvom&quot; () at the Mir studio in Moscow and rerecorded the album &quot;Kolkhozny pank&quot; at Gala Records.

In 1992, Sektor Gaza released their sixth studio album, &quot;Gulyay, muzhik!&quot; () and toured extensively. In 1993, the group released &quot;Nazhmi na gaz&quot; ().

In 1994, Sektor Gaza released &quot;Kashchey Bessmertny&quot; (), a punk-opera based on the famous Russian folklore figure. On this album, Klinskikh performed original lyrics to the melodies of songs by groups such as AC/DC, Queen, Ace of Base, and Nirvana.

In 1995, the group performed at the Rock Summer festival in Tallinn. They also toured Germany and Israel and performed at the Gorbunov Palace of Culture. Also in August, the single &quot;Tuman&quot; was released.

In 1996, Sektor Gaza released &quot;Gazovaya Ataka&quot; (), which marked a change in the group&#x27;s style and a move away from obscene lyrics. The music video for the track &quot;Tuman&quot; () off this album made it into the rotation of many Russian television channels.

In 1997, the group released &quot;Narcologichesky Universitet Millionov&quot; (). The song &quot;Pora domoy&quot; () from this album became a hit.

In the summer of 1998, Klinskikh and Aleksey Bryantsev (DJ Krot) arranged some Sektor Gaza songs as techno remixes, which were released on the album &quot;Extasy&quot; in 1999.

In October 2000, the group released a new album, &quot;Vosstavshy iz Ada&quot; (). Klinskikh&#x27;s health was in decline due to liver disease. On 4 July 2000, Klinskikh complained of strong pains in his stomach and the left side of his chest. He chose not to cancel a meeting later that day to film a music video. He suffered heart failure shortly thereafter. Klinskikh died in Voronezh at the age of 35.

<text>John Hope (June 2, 1868 – February 22, 1936), born in Augusta, Georgia, was an American educator and political activist, the first African-descended president of both Morehouse College in 1906 and of Atlanta University in 1929, where he worked to develop graduate programs. Both are historically Black colleges.

Determined to finish his education after having had to leave school to help support his family after his father&#x27;s death, Hope went North: graduating from Worcester Academy and Brown University. He returned to the South to teach, and in 1906 became the first African American president of Atlanta Baptist College. He served as president until his death in 1936. After the college&#x27;s affiliation with Atlanta University, Hope was selected in 1929 as the university&#x27;s first African-American president; he worked to develop that institution&#x27;s graduate programs to ensure higher education for Blacks.

Hope was active in national civil rights organizations, including the Niagara Movement, the succeeding National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Southern-based Commission on Interracial Cooperation. In addition, he was active in the National Urban League, the YMCA and the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools. In 1936, he was awarded the NAACP&#x27;s Spingarn Medal.

==Early life and education==
John Hope was born in 1868 in Augusta, Georgia, the son of James Hope, a white Scots-American merchant, and Mary Frances Taylor, a free woman of color. Her mother was part of the class of free people of color well before the Civil War. The senior Hope was born in Langholm, Scotland in 1805, and migrated with his parents at age 12 to New York City in 1817. As a young man, he established a successful grocery business in Manhattan.

In 1831, the senior Hope moved south to Augusta, Georgia, where he became a successful businessman. He later formed a relationship with Mary Frances Taylor. State law prohibited interracial marriage, but they lived openly as a couple to the end of his life and had a family. Of majority European ancestry, their son John Hope was European in appearance and could have passed for white. But, he identified with the African American community and devoted his life to its education and advancement in the postwar segregated South.

Hope was eight when his father died, and his family struggled financially; the executors failed to carry out his father&#x27;s plans for support of him and his mother. The youth left school after eighth grade to work, but five years later John Hope was determined to get educated. He managed to go north for his education, graduating from Worcester Academy in 1890. He went on to Brown University, graduating in 1894. Hope was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Career and marriage==

John Hope returned to the South and began teaching at Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee, a historically Black college founded after the Civil War.

A few years after Hope got established, on December 29, 1897 he married the former Lugenia D. Burns of Nashville. They had children. Lugenia Burns Hope became a well-known social reformer.

In 1898, Hope became a professor of Classics at Atlanta Baptist College, (now Morehouse College), a historically Black college. He moved with his family to Georgia. In 1906 Hope was unanimously chosen to be president of Atlanta Baptist College, the first man of African descent to serve in that position. In 1913 the institution was renamed as Morehouse College.

Hope joined W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter, northern activists, as founders of the Niagara Movement to work for civil rights for Blacks. He was also active in the succeeding organization, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, and became considered a national race leader. He supported full civil rights for Blacks and promoted college education, becoming known for that as Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute was known for vocation education. Hope and Du Bois both agreed that Blacks must have the chance for full academic education to develop leaders for their people.

Hope also became active in the National Urban League, the &quot;Colored Men&#x27;s Department&quot; of the YMCA, and the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools. During World War I, Hope went to France, where he served the United States as a YMCA secretary with American Black soldiers from 1918 until 1919. After his return to the US, he organized the southern-based Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and served as its first president.

Hope continued as president of Morehouse College until his death in 1936. In 1928, Morehouse and Spelman College, a college for women, became affiliated with Atlanta University, also a historically Black college. In 1929 Hope was selected as Atlanta University&#x27;s first African-American president. He concentrated on building the university&#x27;s graduate studies to ensure high-achieving Black scholars a place in academia. He inspired generations of scholars and activists. During his presidency, Atlanta University launched a graduate school, established their Department of Fine Arts, and opened the Trevor Arnett Library.

<text>The lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) is a species of shark from the family Carcharhinidae, known for its yellowish color, which inspires its common name. It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Lemon sharks can grow to in length. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return to specific nursery sites for breeding. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their main source of prey, fish. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to live young, and the females are polyandrous and have a reproductive cycle. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to humans; there have been 10 recorded bites, none of which were life-threatening. The lemon shark&#x27;s life span is unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old. The oldest recorded lemon shark in captivity died in 2023 at the age of 40 years.

==Origins ==
The lemon shark was first named and described in 1868 by Felipe Poey. He originally named it &quot;Hypoprion brevirostris&quot;, but later renamed it &quot;Negaprion brevirostris.&quot; The lemon shark has also appeared in literature as &quot;Negaprion fronto&quot; and &quot;Carcharias fronto&quot; (Jordan and Gilbert, 1882), &quot;Carcharias brevirostris&quot; (Gunther, 1870), and &quot;Carcharhinus brevirostris&quot; (Henshall, 1891).

==Description==
The shark&#x27;s yellow colouring serves as an excellent camouflage when swimming over the sandy seafloor in its coastal habitat. The lemon shark commonly attains a length of and a weight up to by adulthood, although sexual maturity is attained at in males and in females. The maximum recorded length and weight is and , respectively. It has a flattened head with a short, broad snout, and the second dorsal fin is almost as large as the first. Like all cartilaginous fish, lemon sharks have electroreceptors concentrated in their heads, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini. These receptors detect electrical pulses emitted by potential prey and allow these nocturnal feeders to sense their prey in the dark. Note that lemon sharks are often confused with bull sharks; lemon sharks have quite similarly sized first and second dorsal fins, whereas those of bull sharks are differently sized.

==Distribution==
Lemon sharks are found from New Jersey to southern Brazil in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean. They also live off the coast of west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic. In addition, lemon sharks have been found in the eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador and in Cape Verde in Sal Island. This species of shark often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, enclosed bays, and river mouths; however, lemon sharks have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92 meters (301 feet.) Although lemon sharks do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their lives.

==Habitat selection==
Information about activity patterns and the use of space is important in understanding a species&#x27; behavioral ecology. Animals often make decisions about habitat use by evaluating their environment&#x27;s abiotic conditions that serve as valuable indicators of good foraging sites or predator-safe locations. Lemon sharks select habitats in warm and shallow water with a rocky or sandy bottom.

The environmental temperature influences an individual&#x27;s body temperature, which ultimately affects physiological processes such as growth and metabolism. Lemon sharks, therefore, select warm-water habitats to maintain optimal metabolic levels. They are believed to avoid areas with thick sea grasses because they make finding prey more difficult. Lemon sharks tend to live in or near shallow-water mangroves, which are often the nursery areas of several species of fish. The data gathered about the characteristics of shark nursery areas is mostly based on coastal species, this is due to their occurrence in bays, estuaries, river deltas, and shallow coastal waters. One theory is that lemon sharks select mangrove habitats due to the abundance of prey that resides there, while another theory posits that mangroves provide a safe haven from adult lemon sharks that occasionally feed on juvenile sharks and are unable to enter the shallow waters. Ontogenetic niche shifts, or changes in an animal&#x27;s niche breadth or position, to deeper waters are known to occur in relation to a lemon shark&#x27;s size. These changes occur due to the dramatic decrease in the risk of predation as body size increases. Habitat selection clearly depends on a variety of biological and environmental variables.

The mangrove areas that lemon sharks inhabit are often referred to as their nursery sites. A nursery site is best defined as the most common area sharks are encountered, the location sharks tend to remain at after birth or frequently return to, and the habitat used by shark groups repeatedly for several years. The nursery ground concept has been known and studied for at least a century. In addition, fossil evidence from 320 million years ago suggests the use of shallow, coastal areas as pupping grounds is primitive.

Lemon sharks have proven to be an ideal model species to challenge the belief that all sharks are opportunistic predators due to their tendency to use nursery areas for an extended period of time. Lemon shark feeding behaviors are easy to determine because their well-defined home ranges are conducive to accurate calculations of both the amount and types of prey in the environment and diet of a lemon shark.

Lemon sharks feed at night and are mainly piscivorous; however, they have been known to feed on crustaceans and benthic organisms. Intraspecific predation, or cannibalism, of juvenile lemon sharks by larger conspecifics has also been documented. Rather than feeding randomly, lemon sharks display a high degree of preference for certain species and size of prey when environmental conditions are favorable. Lemon sharks tend to prey on smaller sharks, bony fish, sting rays, mollusks and birds, as well as types of catfish, mullet jacks, porcupine fish and cowfish, they also tend to prefer a prey when it is more abundant and available. Lemon sharks feed selectively on species that are slower and more easily captured by using a stalking technique. For example, parrotfish and mojarras are common prey in the Bahamas because they use camouflage rather than an escape response and are vulnerable due to their stationary foraging behavior. Lemon sharks feed on prey that are intermediate in size compared to other available prey. This tendency can be explained by the tradeoff between the probability of capture and the profitability when it comes to prey size. The general trend in the foraging behavior of lemon sharks conforms to the optimal foraging theory, which suggests a positive relationship between prey selectivity and availability.

Rather than rolling on their sides to rip off chunks of prey, lemon sharks approach their victim with speed only to brake suddenly using their pectoral fins upon contact. The animal then jabs forward multiple times until it has a good grasp of its prey in its jaw and proceeds to shake its head from side to side until it tears off a chunk of flesh. A feeding frenzy, or large swarm of other sharks, then forms as the individuals sense the blood and bodily fluids released from the prey. Sounds of struggling prey also attract groups of sharks, suggesting they use sound detection for predation. Group feeding behavior such as pack hunting or communal scavenging was observed in a study in which pieces of the same stingray were found in the stomachs of several lemon shark individuals that were caught and examined.

==Social behavior==

Many species of sharks, including the lemon shark, are known to actively prefer to be social and live in groups or loose aggregations. A few benefits of group living are enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. Group living and a preference for social interaction is thought to be important for the survival and success of juvenile lemon sharks. In a group consisting of the sharks, there can be up to twenty. Group living, though, comes with its costs. A few include increased risk of disease, ease of parasite transmission, and competition for resources.

Lemon sharks are found in groups based on similar size. Passive sorting mechanisms such as its ontogenetic habitat shift have been postulated to contribute to the formation of groups organized based on size or sex. One exception to this behavior is that sharks up to one year old show no preference for groups of matched or unmatched size. One hypothesis for this finding is that it is beneficial for the small young lemon sharks to associate with the larger individuals because they have an easier time gathering information about the habitat regarding elements such as predators and local prey. Lemon shark groups form due to an active desire to be social rather than a simple attraction to the same limited resources such as the mangrove habitat and prey associated with such a habitat.

Many studies have related brain size with complex social behaviors in mammals and birds. The brain of a lemon shark, being comparable in relative mass to that of a mammal or bird, suggests they have the ability to learn from social interactions, cooperate with other individuals, and have the potential to establish dominance hierarchies and stable social bonds.

==Reproduction==
Lemon sharks congregate for reproduction at special mating grounds. Females give birth to their young in shallow nursery waters to which they are philopatric. Lemon shark young are known as pups and they tend to remain in the nursery area for several years before venturing into deeper waters. Lemon sharks are viviparous, meaning that the mother directly transfers nutrients to her young via a yolk-sac placenta and the young are born alive. Fertilization is internal and occurs after a male lemon shark holds a female, bites her, and inserts his clasper into her cloaca. Female lemon sharks are polyandrous and sperm competition occurs due to their ability to store sperm in an oviducal gland for several months. Several studies suggest that polyandry in female lemon sharks has adapted out of convenience, rather than indirect genetic benefits to offspring. This type of polyandry is termed as convenience polyandry because females are believed to mate multiple times to avoid harassment by males. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle, requiring a year for gestation and another year for oogenesis and vitellogenesis after parturition. Lemon sharks reach sexual maturity around 12–16 years of age and have low fecundity. Males tend to mature earlier than females. The maximum number of pups recorded in a litter is 18.

==Relationship with humans==
This species of shark is best known in its behavior and ecology, mainly due to the work of Samuel Gruber at the University of Miami, who studied the lemon shark both in the field and in the laboratory from 1967. The population around the Bimini Islands in the western Bahamas, where Gruber&#x27;s Bimini Biological Field Station is situated, is probably the best known of all shark populations. 

The lemon shark is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers along the U.S. Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and in the eastern Pacific Ocean due to its prized meat, fins, and skin. Lemon shark skin may be used for leather and its meat can be consumed and is believed to be a delicacy in many cultures. Concern exists that over-fishing has led the lemon shark populations in the western north Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean to decline. It is considered vulnerable. Overfishing is the main threat to lemon sharks, there has been a 50% to 79% decrease for the past fifty years. 

Lemon sharks do not represent a large threat to humans. The International Shark Attack File lists 11 unprovoked lemon shark bites, none of which were fatal.

<doc id="973194" wikidata="Q5020796" url="?curid=973194" title="1996 California Proposition 209">
<text>Proposition 209 (also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative or CCRI) is a California ballot proposition which, upon approval in November 1996, amended the state constitution to prohibit state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity, specifically in the areas of public employment, public contracting, and public education. Modeled on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the California Civil Rights Initiative was authored by two California academics, Glynn Custred and Tom Wood. It was the first electoral test of affirmative action policies in North America. It passed with 55% in favor to 45% opposed, thereby banning affirmative action in the state&#x27;s public sector.

==History==

=== Context ===
The controversy pertaining to affirmative action in California can most notably be traced back to the historic 1978 Supreme Court case &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.&quot; There were two major decisions from the case that still stand today. Firstly, the quota system that was once used by the University of California, Davis’ admission process for minority students was ruled unlawful. Secondly, higher-level academic institutions were not prohibited from considering race in the admissions process. The ruling determined in &quot;Bakke&quot; acted as “a catalyst for voluntary affirmative action programs.” Researchers suggest that the development of such programs for the sake of increasing campus diversity explains the controversy surrounding the implementation of Proposition 209 and &quot;Bakke&quot; marks the origination of affirmative action debates.

=== Origins ===
The political campaign to place the language of CCRI on the California ballot as a constitutional amendment was initiated by Joe Gelman (president of the Board of Civil Service Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles), Arnold Steinberg (a pollster and political strategist) and Larry Arnn (president of the Claremont Institute). It was later endorsed by Governor Pete Wilson and supported and funded by the California Civil Rights Initiative Campaign, led by University of California Regent Ward Connerly, a Wilson ally. A key co-chair of the campaign was law professor Gail Heriot, who served as a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The initiative was opposed by affirmative action advocates and traditional civil rights and feminist organizations on the left side of the political spectrum. Proposition 209 was voted into law on November 5, 1996, with 55 percent of the vote, and has withstood legal scrutiny ever since.

=== National impact ===
In November 2006, a similar amendment modeled on California&#x27;s Proposition 209 was passed in Michigan, titled the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. The constitutionality of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative was challenged in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. The case, &quot;Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action&quot;, made its way to the United States Supreme Court. On April 22, 2014, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-2 that the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative is constitutional, and that states had the right to ban the practice of racial and gender preferences/affirmative action if they chose to do so through the electoral process.

==Text==
The text of Proposition 209 was drafted by Cal State anthropology professor Glynn Custred and California Association of Scholars Executive Director Thomas Wood. Its passage amended the California constitution to include a new section (Section 31 of Article I), which now reads:

=== Failed attempts to repeal ===

=== Senate Bill 185 ===
On September 1, 2011, SB 185 passed both chambers of the California State Legislature, but was vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown. SB 185 would have countered Proposition 209 and authorized the University of California and the California State University to consider race, gender, ethnicity, and national origin, along with other relevant factors, in undergraduate and graduate admissions, to the maximum extent permitted by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section 31 of Article I of the California Constitution, and relevant case law. SB 185 was strongly supported by the University of California Students Association.

=== Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5 ===
On December 3, 2012, California State Senator Edward Hernandez introduced California Senate Constitutional Amendment No.5 (SCA-5) in the State Senate. This initiative proposed an amendment to the state constitution to remove provisions of California Proposition 209 related to public post-secondary education, to permit state universities to consider applicants&#x27; race, gender, color, ethnicity, or national origin in admission decisions. If passed by both the State Senate and State Assembly, SCA-5 would have been presented to California voters in the November 2014 election. SCA-5 was passed by the California State Senate on January 30, 2014. On February 24, 2014, Gene D. Block, chancellor of UCLA, sent an open letter to all students and faculty expressing his strong opposition to Proposition 209. Following resistance from various citizen groups, including Asian American groups, Senator Hernandez withdrew his measure from consideration.

=== Proposition 16 ===
On January 18, 2019, Assemblymembers Shirley Weber, Mike Gipson, and Miguel Santiago introduced Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 5 (ACA 5) ACA 5 was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have repealed the provisions enacted by Proposition 209. In June 2020, the California State Legislature passed ACA 5 with more than a two-thirds vote in each house, allowing the proposal to become a qualified ballot measure and later Proposition 16. Proposition 16 was rejected by 57.23% of voters in the November 2020 election, meaning that Prop 209 remains in the California Constitution.

=== Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 7 ===
In 2023, Assemblymember Corey Jackson introduced Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 7 (ACA 7). The amendment&#x27;s author decided to let the proposal die, in part due to the fear that &quot;... voters wouldn’t pass the measure...&quot;

==Support==
Supporters of Proposition 209 contended that existing affirmative action programs led public employers and universities to reject applicants based on their race, and that Proposition 209 would &quot;restore and reconfirm the historic intention of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&quot; The basic and simple premise of Proposition 209 is that every individual has a right, and that right is not to be discriminated against, or granted a preference, based on their race or gender. Since the number of available positions are limited, discriminating against or giving unearned preference to a person based solely, or even partially on race or gender deprives qualified applicants of all races an equal opportunity to succeed. It also pits one group against another and perpetuates social tension.

==Opposition==
Opponents of Proposition 209 argued that it would end affirmative action practices of tutoring, mentoring, outreach and recruitment of women and minorities in California universities and businesses and would gut state and local protections against discrimination. After passage of Proposition 209, some students protested at universities including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Santa Cruz, and San Francisco State University.

===Voter demographics===
On November 5, 1996, the Los Angeles Times conducted an exit poll of 2,473 voters who cast ballots in the general election at 40 polling places. The margin of error was 3 percent (higher for subgroups). The following is the exit poll data on Proposition 209:
== Aftermath ==

===Legal challenges===
Proposition 209 has been the subject of many lawsuits in state courts since its passage but has withstood legal scrutiny over the years. On November 27, 1996, U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson blocked enforcement of the proposition. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned that ruling.

On August 2, 2010, in a case brought before the Supreme Court of California by the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) found for the second time that Proposition 209 was constitutional. The ruling, by a 6–1 majority, followed a unanimous affirmation in 2000 of the constitutionality of Prop. 209 by the same court.

On April 2, 2012, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the latest challenge to Proposition 209. The three-judge panel concluded that it was bound by a 9th Circuit ruling in 1997 upholding the constitutionality of the affirmative action ban. Ninth Circuit Judge A. Wallace Tashima disagreed in part with the ruling, saying he believes the court &quot;wrongly decided&quot; the issue in 1997.

===Effect on enrollment, graduation, and income===
According to UC Office of the President, &quot;Proposition 209 instigated a dramatic change in UC admissions policy, with URG [under represented group] enrollment at the Berkeley and UCLA campuses immediately falling by more than 60 percent and systemwide URG enrollment falling by at least 12 percent.&quot; The same report concluded that &quot;Prop 209 led URG applicants to cascade out of UC into measurably less-advantageous universities, which combined with declines in degree attainment and STEM persistence to lower each URG applicant&#x27;s wages by about 5 percent between ages 23 and 35.&quot; Another study found that while enrollment of minority students dropped immediately in the wake of Prop 209, the grades and academic achievements of the students in the system rose significantly.

Based on &quot;University of California Applicants, Admits and New Enrollees by Campus, Race/Ethnicity&quot;, prepared by Institutional Research, the University of California Office of the President, August 11, 2011, enrollment percentages of the four major ethnic groups university-wide are:

African American enrollment rates dropped significantly immediately after the passage of Prop 209. Criticism was raised that of the 4,422 students in UCLA&#x27;s freshman class of 2006, only 96 (2.26%) were African American. Despite this, African American enrollment has rebounded and even exceeded its pre-Prop 209 percentages.

The percentage of Latino students admitted to the UC system as of 2007 exceeded the Proposition 209 level, though this is also correlated with an increase in the Latino population in the state of California.

Researchers also found that enrollment statistics for Native American students beginning in 1997 through 2006 declined by 38% cumulatively and, unlike other ethnic groups, have not increased since.

A comprehensive, peer-reviewed study by Zachary Bleemer found that Prop 209 has had a negative impact on graduation rates, graduate school attendance, and income for black and Hispanic students.

In 2021, the University of California freshmen class reached an all-time high with 84,223 students. Latinos were the largest group at 37%, followed by Asian Americans at 34%; Non-Hispanic White students at 20%; African Americans at 5%; and 4% were composed of members of other groups, including American Indians, Pacific Islanders or those who declined to state their race or ethnicity.

===Private sector response===
One response to Proposition 209 was the establishment of the IDEAL Scholars Fund to provide community and financial support for underrepresented students at the University of California, Berkeley. Private universities and colleges, as well as employers, are not subject to Proposition 209 unless they receive public contracts.

<doc id="973198" wikidata="Q5440009" url="?curid=973198" title="Federal Analogue Act">
<text>The Federal Analogue Act, , is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act passed in 1986 which allows any chemical &quot;substantially similar&quot; to a controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II to be treated as if it were listed in Schedule I, but only if intended for human consumption. These similar substances are often called designer drugs. The law&#x27;s broad reach has been used to successfully prosecute possession of chemicals openly sold as dietary supplements and naturally contained in foods (e.g., the possession of phenethylamine, a compound found in chocolate, has been successfully prosecuted based on its &quot;substantial similarity&quot; to the controlled substance methamphetamine). The law&#x27;s constitutionality has been questioned by now Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch on the basis of Vagueness doctrine.

==Definition==
(32)
*(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term &quot;controlled substance analogue&quot; means a substance -
**(i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;
**(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
**(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.
*(B) The designation of gamma butyrolactone or any other chemical as a listed chemical pursuant to paragraph (34) or (35) does not preclude a finding pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the chemical is a controlled substance analogue.
*(C) Such term does not include -
**(i) a controlled substance;
**(ii) any substance for which there is an approved new drug application;
**(iii) with respect to a particular person any substance, if an exemption is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 355 of this title to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption; or
**(iv) any substance to the extent not intended for human consumption before such an exemption takes effect with respect to that substance.

==Case law==

===&quot;United States v. Forbes&quot;===
&quot;United States v. Forbes&quot;, 806 F. Supp. 232 (D. Colo. 1992), a Colorado district court case, considered the question of whether the drug alphaethyltryptamine (AET) was a controlled substance analogue in the United States. The controlled drugs to which it was alleged that AET was substantially similar were the tryptamine analogues dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and diethyltryptamine (DET).
 
AET
DMT
DET

In this case, the court ruled that AET was not substantially similar to DMT or DET, on the grounds that (i) AET is a primary amine while DMT and DET are tertiary amines, (ii) AET cannot be synthesized from either DMT or DET, and (iii) the hallucinogenic or stimulant effects of AET are not substantially similar to the effects of DMT or DET. Furthermore, the court ruled that the definition of controlled substance analogue given in the Federal Analogue Act was unconstitutionally vague, in that

&quot;Because the definition of &#x27;analogue&#x27; as applied here provides neither fair warning nor effective safeguards against arbitrary enforcement, it is void for vagueness.&quot;

The common law principle that the people should have the right to know what the law is, means that the wording of laws should be sufficiently clear and precise that it is possible to give a definitive answer as to whether a particular course of action is legal or illegal. However, despite this ruling the Federal Analogue Act was not revised, and instead AET was specifically scheduled to avoid any future discrepancies.

As a district court decision, this case is not binding precedent.

===&quot;United States v. Washam&quot; ===
&quot;United States v. Washam&quot; (2002) 312 F.3d 926, 930 was an appellate decision for the eighth judicial circuit in which it was considered whether the drug 1,4-Butanediol (1,4-B) was a controlled substance analogue in the United States. The controlled drug which it was alleged 1,4-B was substantially similar to was gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). 

1,4-B
GHB

In this case the court ruled that 1,4-B was substantially similar to GHB, on the grounds that (i) &quot;1,4-Butanediol and GHB are both linear compounds containing four carbons and that there is only one difference between the substances on one side of their molecules&quot;, and, more importantly, (ii) that 1,4-B is metabolized into GHB by the body and so produces substantially similar physiological effects.

It was raised in defense that 1,4-B and GHB contain different functional groups. but these were not held to be grounds to consider 1,4-B not substantially similar to GHB.

It was also raised in the case of &quot;Washam&quot; that the Federal Analogue Act was unconstitutionally vague, but in this case the court rejected this argument on the grounds that the defendant&#x27;s actions in concealing her activities and lying to DEA agents showed that she knew her actions were illegal, and furthermore that &quot;…a person of common intelligence has sufficient notice under the statute that 1,4-Butanediol is a controlled substance analogue.&quot; The court in &quot;Washam&quot; construed the Analogue Act to require parts A(i) and either A(ii) or A(iii), and concluded the Act was constitutionally permissible upon this construction.

As a result of &quot;Washam&quot;, the Federal Analogue Act has been upheld (at least for the states and territories comprising the eighth judicial circuit) and can be considered valid at the present time.

However, a jury in Federal District Court in Chicago in a different case found 1,4-butanediol not to be an analog of GHB under federal law, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict and so 1,4-butanediol is currently not a controlled substance analogue.

<text>Louise Colet (15 August 1810 – 9 March 1876), born Louise Revoil de Servannes, was a French poet and writer.

==Life and works==
She was born at the hôtel d&#x27;Antoine (fr) in Aix-en-Provence in France. In her twenties she married Hippolyte Colet, an academic musician, partly in order to escape provincial life and live in Paris.

Upon arrival in Paris, Colet began to submit her work for approval and publication and soon won a two-thousand-franc prize from the Académie française, the first of four prizes won from the Académie. At her salon participated many of her contemporaries in the Parisian literary community, such as Victor Hugo.

In 1840, she gave birth to her daughter Henriette, but neither her husband nor her lover, Victor Cousin, would acknowledge paternity. Later she became the paramour of Gustave Flaubert, Alfred de Musset, and Abel Villemain. After her husband died, Colet supported herself and her daughter with her writing.

Her brother was the painter Pierre Révoil. Louise Colet died in Paris.

Though married to Hippolyte Colet, Louise had a steamy eight-year affair, in two stages, with Gustave Flaubert. The relationship turned sour, however, and they broke up in March 1855. In 1859, Louise wrote a novel, &quot;Lui&quot;, a thinly disguised account of her affair with Musset and her frustration with Flaubert. However, Colet&#x27;s book has failed to have the lasting significance of Flaubert&#x27;s 1857 novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. Flaubert wrote dozens of long letters to her, in 1846–1847, then especially between 1851 and 1855. Many of them are a precious source of information on the progress of the writing of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. In many others, Flaubert gives lengthy appreciations and critical comments on the poems that Colet sent to him for his judgment before offering them for publication. These comments show the vast differences between the two writers on the matter of style and literary expression, she being a Romanticist whereas he was deeply convinced that the writer must abstain from gush and self-indulgence.

<doc id="973234" wikidata="Q371372" url="?curid=973234" title="Lard (band)">
<text>Lard is an American hardcore punk/industrial band founded in 1988 as a side project by Jello Biafra (vocals; formerly of Dead Kennedys), Al Jourgensen (guitar; of Ministry), Paul Barker (bass; also of Ministry), and Jeff Ward (drums; once a Ministry touring member). Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, and Rey Washam.

Like most of Biafra&#x27;s work, Lard&#x27;s songs are angrily political (the War on Drugs is a particularly common theme) but often have a tinge of humor.

Lard has not officially toured and has only performed live a handful of times, mostly around the San Francisco area (where Jello lives and operates his Alternative Tentacles record label). The band played during Ministry&#x27;s 1988 tour and throughout their 1989–1990 dates, once in Chicago after wrapping the recording of &quot;The Last Temptation of Reid&quot;, once at the conclusion of a Ministry concert in Los Angeles (March 24, 2003), and at the San Francisco (September 26, 2004), Portland (September 28, 2004) and Seattle (September 29, 2004) dates of Ministry&#x27;s Evil Doer tour. Because its key members are active with other projects, it is unlikely that the band will tour.

According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which was to be recorded in Jourgensen&#x27;s El Paso studio. However, according to a January 2010 interview with Jello Biafra, he indicated that a new Lard album was unlikely, saying &quot;Me and Al have talked about it for years, but we&#x27;ve never been able to nail down a time to try and put it together.&quot;.

According to a 2020 interview, Jourgensen said that he and Biafra plan to make a brand new Lard album soon with them emailing songs back and forth.

<text>Button Men is a two-player dice game invented by James Ernest of Cheapass Games, first released in 1999.

A game of Button Men typically takes less than ten minutes to play. Each player is represented by a pin-back button or playing card of their choice. The buttons are usually metal or plastic discs, about in diameter, with a pin on the back that can be used to fasten them to clothing. A button bears the name and illustration of the combatant (&quot;Button Man&quot; or &quot;fighter&quot;) assumed by the player. Each button indicates the quantity, maximum value, and abilities (if any) of the player&#x27;s dice.

==Background and history==

&quot;Button Men&quot; is a game designed for fan conventions and other public venues. It can be played on short notice and games are quick to complete. Buttons are meant to be worn on clothing, bags, or other accessories, advertising that the wearer has a button to play with and is open to challenges. Buttons may also advertise something else, such as a company, a webcomic, or another game.

In 2000, &quot;Button Men&quot; won the Origins Awards for &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 1999&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game of 1999&quot;.

&quot;Button Men&quot; can be extended by creating more buttons. It has continued to be extended since its inception; , over 200 buttons have been printed. Many are now out of print.

In 2009, Thrust Interactive released an iPhone version of the game in collaboration with Cheapass Games.

In 2011, Cheapass Games began reclaiming their older and out-of-print games in an experiment to apply the &quot;freemium&quot; business model to board games. &quot;Button Men&quot; was revamped into a trading-card format that can be printed and cut apart for gameplay. Two sets, &quot;Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Vampires,&quot; have been released in this format.

In 2016, a Kickstarter was launched for a boxed version of the game that included up to 61 characters (in the Kickstarter exclusive version) and the dice needed to play any two characters against one another. This self-contained set included the old skills Shadow and Poison, but added a variation on Speed Dice called Rush Dice. In addition to this base set, a reissue of some of the original sets on cards and two Sailor Moon Crystal-based sets were released.

==Online game==
&quot;Button Men&quot; &quot;Online&quot; was a service that allowed users to play games over the internet via a web-based interface. In 2003, &quot;Button Men&quot; &quot;Online&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Play-by-mail Game of 2002&quot;. In February 2012, &quot;Button Men&quot; &quot;Online&quot; went offline due to server problems. After nine months of downtime, a group of players from &quot;Button Men&quot; Online recreated an open-source version of the site. The new version of &quot;Button Men&quot; &quot;Online&quot; went online in March 2014.

==Gameplay==
A game of &quot;Button Men&quot; spans multiple rounds. Players begin by rolling a set of polyhedral dice then proceed through several turns. During each turn, their goal is to manipulate their opponent&#x27;s dice by using their own dice; either capturing, taking control of, or neutralizing them based on their current values. The first player who wins three rounds emerges as the winner.

==Reception==
Scott D. Haring reviewed &quot;Button Men&quot; for the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; and stated that &quot;This would be a great convention game, or a one-day game store event, or . . . just about anything. It&#x27;s quick and fun, but requires some thinking. And some luck. A great game.&quot;

&quot;Pyramid&#x27;s&quot; 1999 magazine named &quot;Button Men&quot; as one of the &quot;Millennium&#x27;s Best Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring said, &quot;This game just gets more and more impressive every time I look at it. . . . the idea is so simple, and the strategy so subtle . . . I&#x27;ve never figured out exactly how to master this game, and I suspect that&#x27;s because there is no good way to do so.&quot;

<doc id="973237" wikidata="Q383462" url="?curid=973237" title="Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Heaven and Hell is the ninth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released on 18 April 1980. It is the first Black Sabbath album to feature vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who replaced original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979.

Produced by Martin Birch, the album was a commercial success, particularly in the United States, where it reached number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified platinum for one million sales. In the UK, it sold well enough to be certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry in April 1982.

==Overview==
The initial sessions for what became &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; began with Ozzy Osbourne following the conclusion of Black Sabbath&#x27;s Never Say Die! Tour. The band convened in Los Angeles for 11 months to record a new album, a process described by guitarist Tony Iommi as a &quot;highly frustrating, never-ending process&quot;. Osbourne has stated that he had become fed up with the experimentation on the preceding albums &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;, preferring the band&#x27;s earlier, heavier sound. In his memoir, Iommi revealed that he still possesses a recording featuring Osbourne singing an early version of what would become &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; with different lyrics and &quot;a totally different&quot; vocal melody.

Ronnie James Dio was introduced to Iommi in 1979 by Sharon Arden, who would later marry Osbourne. Initially, Dio and Iommi discussed forming a new band, rather than a continuation of Black Sabbath. The pair met again by chance at The Rainbow on Sunset in Los Angeles later that year. Both men were in similar situations: Dio was seeking a new project and Iommi required a vocalist. &quot;It must have been fate,&quot; Dio recalled, &quot;because we connected so instantly.&quot; The pair kept in touch via telephone until Dio arrived at Iommi&#x27;s Los Angeles house for a relaxed, getting-to-know-you jam session. On that first day, the duo finished &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;, a song Iommi had abandoned prior to Osbourne&#x27;s firing.

&quot;Sabbath was a band that was floundering,&quot; Dio observed. &quot;And, with my inclusion in it, we pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, cared a lot about each other, and knew that we could do it again – especially under the banner of a band that had been so successful.&quot;

Sabbath&#x27;s line-up was in a state of chaos as the band prepared to enter the studio to record what would become &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. Not only had the band replaced its longtime vocalist, but drummer Bill Ward was battling personal issues that would see him also leave the band within months. Demo recordings for the album, including song titles like &quot;Lady Evil Blues&quot;, &quot;Slap Back&quot;, &quot;Lord She&#x27;s Handsome&quot; and an early version of the title track featured Geoff Nicholls on bass, as longtime bassist Geezer Butler was going through a divorce and his future with the band was in question. When Dio first joined the band, he doubled for a short time as bassist and vocalist, having played bass in the band Elf in the early 1970s. At one point Iommi contacted close friend Frank Zappa for help finding a bassist. Zappa offered his bassist for the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; sessions but Iommi preferred a permanent member. Eventually, Butler returned to the band and Nicholls stayed on as the band&#x27;s unofficial keyboardist.

Former Elf and Rainbow bassist Craig Gruber also rehearsed with the band, though the extent of his involvement is unclear. In a 1996 interview, Iommi stated that Gruber participated only &quot;for a bit&quot;. Gruber has stated that his contribution was quite substantial; he says he cowrote most of &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;″s songs and that it was he and not Butler who played bass on the album. Despite not being credited for his contributions, Gruber says he and the band nonetheless reached &quot;a suitable financial arrangement&quot;. Iommi conceded in his 2011 autobiography that Gruber had indeed recorded all the bass parts on &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, but Butler had re-recorded them upon his return, without listening to Gruber&#x27;s bass tracks. Gruber later stated in an interview in 2009 that he only helped write &quot;Die Young&quot;.

Personal issues aside, drummer Bill Ward was not completely happy with the direction Black Sabbath was moving in creatively. &quot;&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; for me wasn&#x27;t a turning point,&quot; he recalled. &quot;&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was the beginning of a new band of which I had no idea what band I was in. It was almost like Ron was capable of coming up with lyrics that seemed to fit his idea of how Black Sabbath &quot;ought&quot; to be, and I sensed a kind of &quot;unrealness&quot; about the lyrics. My favourite song on &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was a blues song that we did, &#x27;Lonely Is the Word&#x27; – and that seemed to be real. But things like &#x27;Lady Evil&#x27;, they seemed almost like bandwagon-type lyrics. &#x27;Lonely Is the Word&#x27;, I definitely liked playing that song. And &#x27;Children of the Sea&#x27; – I did like to play that too. I thought Ronnie was a very good singer.&quot;

&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was recorded at Miami&#x27;s Criteria Studios (in which the band recorded &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;) and in Paris. Dio suggested the band hire producer Martin Birch, who he had worked with as a member of Rainbow in the 1970s. Birch was Sabbath&#x27;s first outside producer since the band parted ways with Rodger Bain following 1971&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, with Iommi primarily producing the band&#x27;s albums since that point by himself. Iommi stated that the band felt that they were creating something special in &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. In his memoir, he wrote, &quot;Ozzy would sing with the riff. Just listen to &#x27;Iron Man&#x27; and you&#x27;ll catch my drift: his vocal melody line copies the melody of the music. There was nothing wrong with that, but Ronnie liked singing across the riff instead of with it, come up with a melody that was different from that of the music, which musically opens a lot more doors. I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m knocking Ozzy, but Ronnie&#x27;s approach opened up a new way for me to think.&quot;

Black Sabbath had a long history of playing pranks on drummer Ward, and this continued during the recording of &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. During a slow day in the studio, Iommi doused Ward with a solution used by studio technicians to clean the tape heads, and he then set light to the solution, which was much more flammable than he had anticipated. Ward suffered third degree burns as a result and still has scars on his legs from the incident. Ward has stated that, due to his alcoholism, he has no memory at all of the period in which the album was recorded. His behaviour became erratic; on the Heaven &amp; Hell Tour, Ward began dictating long and rambling press releases to the band&#x27;s public relations representatives after every show, instructing them to &quot;get that out on the news wires tonight&quot;. Ward&#x27;s personal issues, which included the deaths of both his parents, would soon force him to leave the band. Dio recalled answering the telephone in his hotel room one morning mid-tour to hear Ward say &quot;I&#x27;m off then, Ron&quot;, to which Dio replied &quot;That&#x27;s nice Bill, where are you going?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m off mate. I&#x27;m at the airport now&quot;, indicating that he was incapable of completing the tour. American drummer Vinny Appice was quickly brought in to replace him. The &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; album represents the only Sabbath material recorded during the Dio era that does not feature Appice on drums.

==Artwork==

The album&#x27;s cover art was taken from a painting by artist Lynn Curlee, &quot;Smoking Angels&quot;, inspired by a 1928 photograph of women dressed as angels smoking backstage during a break at a college pageant. The album&#x27;s back cover illustration of the band was drawn by artist Harry Carmean.

==Reception==

The album was successful, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album (No. 9 UK, No. 28 US) since 1975&#x27;s &quot;Sabotage&quot; and the third highest-selling album of Black Sabbath behind &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, respectively. It was eventually certified platinum in 1986 for selling 1 million copies in the United States. In the UK, it became the third Black Sabbath studio album to attain silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in November 1980. It subsequently attained gold certification (100,000 units sold) in April 1982, the only Black Sabbath studio album to be thus certified. &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was re-released as part of the Black Sabbath box set &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot; in 2008. In 2017, it was ranked 37th at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Six of the album&#x27;s tracks were played live, with only &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot; not making the setlists on the Heaven &amp; Hell Tour. Four of those became mainstays in setlists for the band&#x27;s tours with Dio and Tony Martin: &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Neon Knights&quot;, &quot;Die Young&quot; and the title track.

Some critics insisted that Dio&#x27;s addition irretrievably altered the band, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contending, &quot;Although Dio could belt with the best of them, Sabbath would never be the same.&quot; In his autobiography, Iommi admits, &quot;We were doing big shows and it was difficult for Ronnie to go out and stand in front of people who had seen Ozzy in that spot for ten years. Some of the kids hated it and they&#x27;d shout: &#x27;Ozzy, Ozzy!&#x27; But eventually Ronnie won them over.&quot;

In an interview with Songfacts, current Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society dismisses the idea of the Dio-era being authentic Sabbath: &quot;You listen to Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in it, and it&#x27;s not Black Sabbath. They should have just called it Heaven &amp; Hell right from the beginning. Because you listen to that &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; album, that doesn&#x27;t sound anything close to Black Sabbath. I mean, that sounds about as much like Black Sabbath as &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; sounds like Black Sabbath. If you were to play Black Sabbath for me – and I&#x27;m a huge Sabbath freako – and then with Father Dio over there, I&#x27;d be going, &#x27;Oh, cool, what band is this? This is good stuff.&#x27; I mean, the songs don&#x27;t even sound Black Sabbath-y. I mean, &#x27;Neon Knights&#x27;, could you picture Ozzy singing over that song?&quot;

Mick Wall noted in his book &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, &quot;For once their timing was spot on. In Britain, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine had begun championing a new musical phenomenon it dubbed &#x27;The New Wave of British Heavy Metal&#x27; ... The reborn Black Sabbath, with their glistening new sound, incomparable new singer and top-drawer new album, were seen as part of a widespread revival in rock fandom.&quot;

<doc id="973239" wikidata="Q414724" url="?curid=973239" title="Ethion">
<text>Ethion (C9H22O4P2S4) is an organophosphate insecticide. It is known to affect the neural enzyme acetylcholinesterase and disrupt its function.

== History ==
Ethion was first registered in the US as an insecticide in the 1950s. Annual usage of ethion since then has varied depending on overall crop yields and weather conditions. For example, 1999 was a very dry year; since the drought reduced yields, the use of ethion was less economically rewarding. Since 1998, risk assessment studies have been conducted by (among others) the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency). Risk assessments for ethion were presented at a July 14, 1999 briefing with stakeholders in Florida, which was followed by an opportunity for public comment on risk management for this pesticide.

== Regulatory review ==
Ethion was one of many substances approved for use based on data from Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories, which was later discovered to have engaged in extensive scientific misconduct and fraud, prompting the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization to recommend ethion&#x27;s reanalysis in 1982.

== Synthesis ==
Ethion is produced under controlled pH conditions by reacting dibromomethane with Diethyl dithiophosphoric acid in ethanol. Other methods of synthesis include the reaction of methylene bromide and sodium diethyl phosphorodithioate or the reaction of diethyl dithiophosphoric acid and formaldehyde.

== Reactivity and mechanism ==
Ethion is a small lipophilic molecule. This promotes rapid passive absorption across cell membranes. Thus absorption through skin, lungs, and the gut into the blood occurs via passive diffusion. Ethion is metabolized in the liver via desulfurization, producing the metabolite ethion monoxon. This transformation leads to liver damage. 

Ethion monoxon is an inhibitor of the neuroenzyme cholinesterase (ChE), which normally facilitates nerve impulse transmission; secondary damage thus occurs in the brain. Because the chemical structure of ethion monoxon is similar to that of an organophosphate, its mechanism of poisoning is thought to be the same. See the figure, &quot;Inhibition of cholinesterase by ethion monoxon.&quot; The figure depicts enzyme inhibition as a two-step process. Here, a hydroxyl group (OH) from a serine residue in the active site of ChE is phosphorylated by an organophosphate, causing enzyme inhibition and preventing the serine hydroxyl group from participating in the hydrolysis of another enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (Ach). The phosphorylated form of the enzyme is highly stable, and depending on the R and groups attached to phosphorus, this inhibition can be either reversible or irreversible.
== Metabolism ==
Goats exposed to ethion showed clear distinctions in excretion, absorption half-life and bioavailability. These differences depend on the method of administration. Intravenous injection resulted in a half-life time of 2 hours, while oral administration resulted in a half-life time of 10 hours. Dermal administration lead to a half-life time of 85 hours. These differences in half-life times can be correlated with differences in bio-availability. The bio-availability of ethion via oral administration was less than 5%, whereas the bio-availability via dermal administration of ethion was 20%.

In a study conducted among rats, it was found that ethion is readily metabolized after oral administration. Rat urine samples contained four to six polar water-soluble ethion metabolites.

A study among chickens revealed more about spontaneous ethion distribution in the body. In a representative study, liver, muscle, and fat tissues were examined after 10 days of ethion exposure. In all three cases, ethion or ethion derivatives were present, indicating that it is widely spread in the body. Chicken eggs were also investigated, and it was found that the egg white reaches a steady ethion derivative concentration after four days, while the concentration in yolk was still rising after ten days. In the investigated chickens, about six polar water-soluble metabolites were also found to be present.

In a study performed on goats, heart and kidney tissues were investigated after a period of ethion exposure, and in these tissues, ethion-derivatives were found. This study indicates that the highest levels were found in the liver and kidneys, and the lowest levels in fat. Derivatives were also detected in the goats&#x27; milk.

== Biotransformation ==
Biotransformation of ethion occurs in the liver, where it undergoes desulfurisation to form the active metabolite ethion monoxon. The enzyme cytochrome P-450 catalyzes this step. Because it contains an active oxygen, ethion monoxon is an inhibitor of the neuroenzyme cholinesterase (ChE). ChE can dephosphorylate organophosphate, so in the next step of the biotransformation, ethion monoxon is dephosphorylated and ChE is phosphorylated. The subsequent step in the biotransformation process is not yet completely known, yet it is understood that this happens via esterases in the blood and liver (1). Besides the dephosphorylation of ethion monoxon by ChE, it is likely that the ethion monoxon is partially oxidized toward ethion dioxon.

After solvent partitioning of urine from rats that had been fed ethion, it became clear that the metabolites found in the urine were 99% dissolved in the aqueous phase. This means that only non-significant levels (&lt;1 %) were present in the organic phase and that the metabolites are very hydrophilic.

In a parallel study in goats, radioactive labeled ethion with incorporated 14C was used. After identification of the 14C residues in organs of the goats, such as the liver, heart, kidneys, muscles and fat tissue, it appeared that 0.03 ppm or less of the 14C compounds present was non-metabolized ethion. The metabolites ethion monoxon and ethion dioxon were also not detected in any samples with a substantial threshold (0.005-0.01 ppm). In total, 64% to 75% of the metabolites from the tissues were soluble in methanol. After the addition of a protease, another 17% to 32% were solubilized. In the aqueous phase, at least four different radioactive metabolites were found. However, characterization of these compounds was repeatedly unsuccessful due to their high volatility. One compound was trapped in the kidney and was identified as formaldehyde. This is an indication that the 14C of ethion is used in the formation of natural products.

== Toxicity ==

=== Summary of toxicity ===
Exposure to ethion can happen by ingestion, absorption via the skin, and inhalation. Exposure can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sweating, and confusion. Severe poisoning might lead to fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, loss of reflexes and slurred speech. In even more severe cases, death will be the result of respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.

When being exposed through skin contact, the lowest dose to kill a rat was found to be 150 mg/kg for males and 50 mg/kg for females. The minimum survival time was 6 hours for female rats and 3 hours for male rats, and the maximum time of death was 3 days for females and 7 days for males. The LD50 was 245 mg /kg for male rats and 62 mg/kg for female rats.

When being exposed through ingestion, 10 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day showed no histopathological effect on the respiratory track of rats, nor did 13-week testing on dogs (8.25 mg/kg/day).

LD50 values for pure ethion in rats is 208 mg/kg, and for technical ethion is 21 to 191 mg/kg. Other reported oral LD50 values are 40 mg/kg in mice and guinea pigs. Furthermore, inhalation of ethion is very toxic - during one study which was looking at technical-grade ethion, an LC50 of 2.31 mg/m^3 was found in male rats and of 0.45 mg/m^3 in female rats. Other data reported a 4-hour LC50 in rats of 0.864 mg/L.

=== Acute toxicity ===
Ethion causes toxic effects following absorption via the skin, ingestion, and inhalation, and may cause burns when skin is exposed to it. According to Extoxnet, any form of exposure could result in the following symptoms: pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the eye pupils, tears, salivation, sweating, and confusion may develop within 12 hours. Severe poisoning may result in distorted coordination, loss of reflexes, slurred speech, fatigue and weakness, tremors of the tongue and eyelids, involuntary muscle contractions and can also lead to paralysis and respiratory problems. In more severe cases, ethion poisoning can lead to involuntary discharge of urine or feces, irregular heart beats, psychosis, loss of consciousness, and, in some cases, coma or death. Death is the result of respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Hypothermia, AC heart blocks and arrhythmias are also found to be possible consequences of ethion poisoning. Ethion may also lead to delayed symptoms of other organophosphates.

==== Skin exposure ====
In rabbits receiving 250 mg/kg of technical-grade ethion for 21 days, the dermal exposure lead to increased cases of erythema and desquamation. It also lead to inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase at 1 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was determined to be 0.8 mg/kg/day. In guinea pigs, ethion ALS lead to a slight erythema that cleared in 48 hours, and it was determined that the compound was not a skin sensitizer.

In a study determining the LD50 of ethion, 80 male and 60 female adult rats were dermally exposed to ethion dissolved in xylene. The lowest dose to kill a rat was found to be 150 mg/kg for males and 50 mg/kg for females. The minimum survival time was 6 hours for females and 3 hours for males, while the maximum time of death was 3 days for females and 7 days for males. The LD50 was 245 mg /kg for males and 62 mg/kg for females. Skin contact with organophosphates, in general, may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Other studies found the LC50 via the dermal route to be 915 mg/kg in guinea pigs and 890 mg/kg in rabbits.

Ethion can also cause slight redness and inflammation to the eye and skin that will clear within 48 hours. It is also known to cause blurred vision, pupil constriction and pain.

==== Ingestion ====
A six-month-old boy experienced shallow excursions and intercostal retractions after accidentally ingesting 15.7 mg/kg ethion. The symptoms started one hour after ingestion, and were treated. Five hours after ingestion, respiratory arrest occurred and mechanical ventilation was needed for three hours. Following examinations after one week, one month and one year suggested that full recovery was made. The same boy also showed occurrence of tachycardia, frothy saliva (1 hour after ingestion), watery bowel movements (90 minutes after ingestion), increased white blood cell counts in urine, inability to control his head and limbs, occasional twitching, pupils non-reactive to light, purposeless eye movements, palpable liver and spleen, and there were some symptoms of paralysis.

Testing on rats with 10 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day showed no histopathological effect on the respiratory tract, nor did 13 week testing on dogs (8.25 mg/kg/day). values for pure ethion in rats of 208 mg/kg, and for technical-grade ethion of 21 to 191 mg/kg. Other reported oral LD50 values (for the technical product) are 40 mg/kg in mice and guinea pigs. In a group of six male volunteers no differences in blood pressure or pulse rate were noted, neither in mice or dogs. Diarrhea did occur in mice orally exposed to ethion, severe signs of neurotoxicity were also present. The effects were consistent with cholinergic over stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract.

No hematological effects were reported in an experiment with six male volunteers, nor in rats or dogs. The volunteers did not show differences in muscle tone after intermediate-duration oral exposure, nor did the testing animals to different exposure. It is however knows that ethion can result in muscle tremors and fasciculations. The animal-testing studies on rats and dogs showed no effect on the kidneys and liver, but a different study showed an increased incidence in orange-colored urine. The animal-testing studies on rats and dogs did also not show dermal or ocular effects.

Rabbits, receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day of ethion showed a decrease in body weight, but no effects were seen at 0.6 mg/kg/day. The decrease body, combined with reduced food consumption, was observed for rabbits receiving 9.6 mg/kg/day . Male and female dogs receiving 0.71 mg/kg/day did not show a change in body weight, but dogs receiving 6.9 and 8.25 mg/kg/day showed reduced food consumption and reduced body weight.

In a study with human volunteers, a decrease of plasma cholinesterase was observed during 0.075 mg/kg/day (16% decrease), 0.1 mg/kg/day (23% decrease) and 0.15 mg/kg/day (31%decrease) treatment periods. This was partially recovered after 7 days, and fully recovered after 12 days. No effect on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was observed, nor signs of adverse neurological effects. Another study showed severe neurological effects after a single oral exposure in rats. For male rats, salivation, tremors, nose bleeding, urination, diarrhea, and convulsions occurred at 100 mg/kg, and for female rats, at 10 mg/kg. In a study with albino rats, it was observed that brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited by 22%, erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase by 87%, and plasma cholinesterase by 100% in male rats after being fed 9 mg/kg/day of ethion for 93 days. After 14 days of recovery, plasma cholinesterase recovered completely, and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase recovered 63%. There were no observed effects at 1 mg/kg/day. In a study involving various rats, researchers observed no effects on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase at 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg/day of ethion. In a 90-day study on dogs, in which the males received 6.9 mg/kg/day and the females 8.25 mg/kg/day, ataxia, emesis, miosis, and tremors were observed. Brain and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were inhibited (61-64% and 93-04%, respectively). At 0.71 mg/kg/day in male dogs, the reduction in brain acetylcholinesterase was 23%. There were no observed effects at 0.06 and 0.01 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, a minimal risk level of 0,002 mg/kg/day for oral exposure for acute and intermediate duration was established. Researchers also calculated a chronic-duration minimal risk level of 0.0004 mg/kg/day.

In one study, in which rats received a maximum of 1.25 mg/kg/day, no effects on reproduction were observed. In a study on pregnant river rats, eating 2.5 mg/kg/day, it was observed that the fetuses had increased incidence of delayed ossification of pubes. Another study found that the fetuses of pregnant rabbits, eating 9.6 mg/kg/day had increased incidence of fused sterna centers.

==== Inhalation ====
Ethion is quite toxic to lethal via inhalation. One study, looking at technical-grade ethion, found an LC50 of 2.31 mg/m3 in male rats and of 0.45 mg/m3 in female rats. Other data reported a 4-hour LC50 in rats of 0.864 mg/L. As stated earlier, ethion can also lead to pupillary constriction, muscle cramps, excessive salivation, sweating, nausea, dizziness, labored breathing, convulsions, and unconsciousness. A sensation of tightness in the chest and rhinorrhea are also very common after inhalation.

=== Carcinogenic effects ===
There are no indications that ethion is carcinogenic in rats and mice. When rats and mice were fed ethion for two years, the animals did not develop cancer any faster than the control group of animals that were not given ethion. Ethion has not been classified for carcinogenicity by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) or the EPA.

== Treatment ==
When orally exposed, gastric lavage shortly after exposure can be used to reduce the peak absorption. It is also suspected that treatment with active charcoal could be effective to reduce peak absorption. Safety guidelines also encourage to induce vomiting to reduce oral exposure, if the victim is still conscious.

In case of skin exposure, it is advised to wash and rinse with plenty of water and soap to reduce exposure. In case of inhalation, fresh air is advised to reduce exposure.

Treating the ethion-exposure itself is done in the same way as exposure with other organophosphates. The main danger lies in respiratory problems - if symptoms are present, then artificial respiration with an endotracheal tube is used as a treatment. The effect of ethion on muscles or nerves is counteracted with atropine. Pralidoxime can be used to act against organophosphate poisoning, this must be given as fast as possible after the ethion poisoning, for its efficacy is inhibited by the chemical change of ethion-enzyme in the body that occurs over time.

== Effects on animals ==
Ethion has an influence on the environment as it is persistent and thus might accumulate through plants and animals. When looking at songbirds, ethion is very toxic. The LD50 in red-winged blackbirds is 45 mg/kg. However, it is moderately toxic to birds like the bobwhite quail (LD50 is 128.8 mg/kg) and starlings (LD50 is greater than 304 mg/kg). These birds would be classified as &#x27;medium sized birds. When looking at larger, upland game birds (like the ring-necked pheasant and waterfowl like the mallard duck, ethion varies from barely toxic to nontoxic. Ethion, however, is very toxic to aquatic organisms like freshwater and marine fish, and is extremely toxic to freshwater invertebrates, with an average LD50 of 0.056 μg/L to 0.0077 mg/L. The LD50 for marine and estuarine invertebrates are 0.04 to 0.05 mg/L.

In a chronic toxicity study, rats were fed 0, 0.1, 0.2 or 2 mg/kg/day ethion for 18 months, and no severe toxic effects were observed. The only significant change was a decrease of cholinesterase levels in the group with the highest dose. Therefore, the NOEL of this study was 0.2 mg/kg. The oral LD50 for pure ethion in rats is 208 mg/kg. The dermal LD50 in rats is 62 mg/kg, 890 mg/kg in rabbits, and 915 mg/kg in guinea pigs. For rats, the 4-hour LD50 is 0.864 mg/L ethion.

== Detection Methods ==
Insecticides such as ethion can be detected by using a variety of chemical analysis methods. Some analysis methods, however, are not specific for this substance. In a recently introduced method, the interaction of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with ethion results in the quenching of the resonance relay scattering (RRS) intensity. The change in RRS was shown to be linearly correlated to the concentration of ethion (range: 10.0–900 mg/L). Another advantage of this method over general detection methods is that ethion can be measured in just 3 minutes with no requirement for pretreatment of the sample. From interference tests, it was shown that this method achieves good selectivity for ethion. The limit of detection (LOD) was 3.7 mg/L and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 11.0 mg/L. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) for samples containing 15.0 and 60.0 mg/L of ethion in water were 4.1 and 0.2 mg/L, respectively.

== Microbial degradation ==
Ethion remains a major environmental contaminant in Australia, among other locations, because of its former usage in agriculture. However, there are some microbes that can convert ethion into less toxic compounds. Some Pseudomonas and Azospirillum bacteria were shown to degrade ethion when cultivated in minimal salts medium, where ethion was the only source of carbon. Analysis of the compounds present in the medium after bacterial digestion of ethion demonstrated that no abiotic hydrolytic degradation products of ethion (e.g., ethion dioxon or ethion monoxon) were present. The biodigestion of ethion is likely used to support rapid growth of these bacteria.

<text>Dhanbad is the second-most populated city in the Indian state of Jharkhand after Jamshedpur and major financial hub of Jharkhand. In terms of economy Dhanbad has largest economy in the state of Jharkhand &amp; it is often referred as &#x27;Economic Capital of Jharkhand&#x27;. Dhanbad is also an emerging IT hub and a center for manufacturing industries . Dhanbad District is known for its cultural heritage and has several tourist attractions, making it a well-rounded destination. Dhanbad ranks as the 42nd largest city in India and is the 33rd largest million-plus urban agglomeration in India. Dhanbad Railway Division generates highest revenue in India . Dhanbad shares its land borders with Paschim Bardhaman district and Purulia district of West Bengal and Bokaro, Giridih and Jamtara districts of Jharkhand. The city is called the &#x27;Coal Capital of India&#x27; for housing one of the largest coal mines in the country. The prestigious institute, Indian School of Mines (now IIT Dhanbad) is situated in Dhanbad. Apart from coal, it has also grown in information technology.

Dhanbad is the 96th fastest growing city in the world, according to the City Mayors Foundation. It is the 56th cleanest city of India, according to the 2019 Swachh Survekshan cleanliness survey. It showed a great change in the city which was considered the dirtiest city in the 2018 Swachh Survekshan. Dhanbad Municipal Corporation works for increasing green cover in the city. 
Dhanbad is suffering from underground coal seam fire and harmful fumes coming out from the ground. Since colonial rule till date it can&#x27;t be doused. Significant areas of Jharia coal belt area is fire affected. People residing there feared that very soon in future there will be land subsidence here. Among the rail divisions of Indian Railway, Dhanbad Rail Division is the largest revenue generator. Dhanbad is ranked as the top city in India with the highest 4G mobile phone network availability in India by a survey of Opensignal.

Dhanbad&#x27;s economy revolves primarily around coal mining and related industries. It is home to several coal mines, including some of the largest in India. This extensive coal reserve has led to the establishment of various industries such as steel plants, power plants, and coal washeries, contributing significantly to the region&#x27;s economic prosperity.

== History ==
The present district used to be a part of Manbhum region and was occupied by Mundari tribals in the wilderness of South undivided Bihar. In the seventh century A.D. some information is available from the account of the travels of Hieun Tsang. These accounts narrate the existence of a powerful kingdom which comprised the district and adjoining areas, ruled by Sasanka. Manbhum was one of the districts of the East India during the British Raj.

The region has thick forests, with rich mineral resources, and had a mixed demographic profile with people from different religious and social groups, including adivasis, particularly the Santals and the Mundas before the city was established. After the Partition of India, the district became a part of Bihar state, and upon re-organization of the Indian states in the mid-1950s, the district became a part of the West Bengal. Purulia district was carved out of the district of Manbhum.

In the Settlement Report for Manbhum (1928) it was stated that no rock inscriptions, copper plates or old coins were discovered and not a single document of copper plate or palm leaf was found, during the Survey and Settlement operations. The oldest authentic documents produced were all on paper and barely even a hundred years old. Dhanbad city was in Manbhum district from 1928 up to 1956. However, on 24 October 1956, Dhanbad district was carved out of Manbhum district with Dhanbad as District headquarter on the recommendation of the States Reorganization Commission vide notification 1911.

This was done under the commitment and leadership of journalist, Satish Chandra. In the year 2006, Dhanbad celebrated 50 years of being an independent district and city. From 1956 to 14 November 2000, it was under Bihar. At present, it is in Jharkhand, after the creation of the state on 15 November 2000. The discovery of rich deposits of coal in the region caused the city to flourish financially, but also bought notorious coal-mafia and gang wars which continues to this day with areas of city like Wasseypur being most affected by the conflict.

==Geography==

Dhanbad has an average elevation of . Its geographical length (extending from north to south) is and the breadth (stretching across east to West) is . It shares its boundaries with West Bengal in the eastern and southern part, Giridih and Dumka in the North and Bokaro District in the west. Dhanbad comes under the Chota Nagpur Plateau.

=== Rivers and Lakes ===
The Damodar is a major river of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. It rises in Palamu and flows eastward between the plateaus of Ranchi and Hazaribag. It is joined by the Bokaro, the Konar and the Barakar rivers. The Damodar enters Dhanbad district at its confluence with the Jamuria, a stream which marks the western boundary of Dhanbad with Hazaribagh District. Further east, the Damodar is joined by the Katri River which rises in the foothills below Parasnath and traverses through the coal-field area.

<text>The Archbishop of Sydney is the diocesan bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, Australia and &quot;ex officio&quot; metropolitan bishop of the ecclesiastical Province of New South Wales.

From 1814 to 1836 the colony of New South Wales was part of the Diocese of Calcutta. In 1836, the Diocese of Australia was formed and the first bishop of Australia enthroned. By letters patent of 25 June 1847, the Diocese of Australia was split into their four dioceses, one of which being the Diocese of Sydney and its bishop the Bishop of Sydney. The Diocese of Sydney has been led by an archbishop since 1897. Since the first creation of another province within Australia in 1905, the archbishop has also been &quot;ex officio&quot; metropolitan of the Province of New South Wales.

The archbishop of Sydney is currently assisted by five regional assistant bishops.

On 6 May 2021, Kanishka Raffel, Dean of St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney since 4 February 2016, was elected as the next archbishop.

<doc id="973251" wikidata="Q6287226" url="?curid=973251" title="Joseph Strayer">
<text>Joseph Reese Strayer (born August 20, 1904, Baltimore, Maryland, – died July 2, 1987, Princeton, New Jersey, ) was an American medievalist who taught for nearly his entire career at Princeton University and chaired the history department there for 20 years (1942-62). He is regarded as one of the most influential American medieval scholars of the 20th century, particularly in terms of the number of students he trained who went on to define the field of medieval history in the United States for many decades thereafter. His primary scholarly interests lay in the legal and administrative institutions of the kingdom of France under the Capetian monarchs, as well as England under the Norman and Angevin dynasties. 

==Life and Teaching Career==
Strayer was born in Baltimore and raised in New York City, where he attended the Horace Mann School. He received a BA from Princeton University in 1925 and a Ph.D from Harvard University in 1930, under the supervision of Charles Homer Haskins. After teaching for one year at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, he returned to Princeton in 1931 as an assistant professor, eventually rising to full professor and chair of the history department, a position which he held from 1942 to 1962. He served as president of the Medieval Academy of America from 1966 to 1969 and of the American Historical Association in 1971. Strayer was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Strayer retired from teaching in 1973, but remained an active scholar well into his later years. 

Strayer has been credited with training a large percentage of the American medievalist profession in the liberal tradition; many of his students are still teaching and active. Some notable scholars whom Strayer trained at Princeton include: John F. Benton, Thomas N. Bisson, Norman F. Cantor, Bennett D. Hill, William Chester Jordan, Richard W. Kaeuper, and Teofilo Ruiz.

Strayer was married twice. His first wife, Lois, with whom he had one daughter, passed away in 1984. In 1986, he married another retired medievalist, Sylvia Thrupp (1903-1997), a noted scholar of English social and economic history. He died in Princeton the following year after a brief illness.

==Scholarship== 
Strayer inherited from Haskins a strong commitment to Wilsonian progressivism, and viewed history through the lens of the evolution of governmental institutions and law. Strayer&#x27;s primary interests in medieval feudal institutions and kingship lay in their role in shaping the emergence of later nation-states in Europe and North America. Strayer famously described feudalism as &quot;public power in private hands&quot; and saw the centralizing activities of medieval monarchies as attempts to reverse this fragmentation and create a more stable order around the state, thereby restoring the notion of a commonwealth and the public good. Norman Cantor recognized three books as most important to Strayer&#x27;s legacy: &quot;Feudalism&quot; (1965), which summarized three decades of his research and thinking on the topic; &quot;On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State&quot; (1970), in which he shows the relevance of medieval historical institutions to modern governmental institutions; and &quot;The Reign of Philip the Fair&quot; (1980), representing over 30 years of archival research and the most comprehensive work on the topic in any language – other than Jean Favier&#x27;s &quot;Philippe le Bel&quot; (1978). Strayer was editor of the &quot;Dictionary of the Middle Ages&quot;, the largest and most comprehensive encyclopedia on the subject in the English language. 

==Work for the CIA==
Strayer was engaged in intelligence work for many years during the Cold War as a consulting analyst with the CIA&#x27;s Office of National Estimates. The extent of his involvement, at a time when the CIA was running covert operations to destabilize governments around the world (Iran, Brazil, Congo, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Chile), has never been fully assessed or verified. 
Strayer, who had known the agency&#x27;s first director, Allen Dulles, from his undergraduate days at Princeton, never revealed any details about his activities but told colleagues that he had been recruited as a consultant because Dulles knew that a medievalist would be skilled at gleaning critical information from sparse or fragmentary sources.

<doc id="973256" wikidata="Q7288977" url="?curid=973256" title="Rāmañña Nikāya">
<text>Rāmañña Nikāya (, also spelled Ramanya [[Nikaya]]) was one of the three major Buddhist orders in Sri Lanka. It was founded in 1864 when Ambagahawatte Saranankara, returned to Sri Lanka after being ordained by the Neyyadhamma Munivara Sangharaja of Ratnapunna Vihara in Burma. It was one of three Sri Lankan orthodox Buddhist monastic orders, along with Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya. On 16 August 2019, the Amarapura and Rammana Nikaya were unified as the Amarapura–Rāmañña Nikāya, making it the largest Buddhist fraternity in Sri Lanka.

==Similar orders==
Rāmañña Nikāya was said to be similar to the Thammayut Nikaya order of Thailand. Rāmañña Nikāya is currently survived in Thailand, Burma and Sri Lanka.

The Most Ven. Napana Premasiri Thero was appointed the Head of the Rāmañña Nikāya on 3 September 2012 following the demise of Venenerable Weweldeniye Medhalankara Thera aged 103.

Rāmañña Nikāya was established on 12 June 1864 in participation with Ven. Ambagahawatte Indaasabhawara Gaanasaami Maha Thera, Ven.Puwakdandawe Paññānanda, Ven.Warāpitiye Sumitta thera.

First Maha Nayaka Thero - Most Ven. Ambagahawatte Indrasabhawara Gnanasami Maha Thera.
Main Station - Mūla Maha Viharaya, Payagala, Kalutara.

==Ascetic Tendency==
In the beginning, the Majority of monasteries of Rāmañña Nikāya were forest monasteries. Although many village temples have been emerged in modern days, the forest tradition is still being continued by Śrī Kalyāṇī Yogāśrama Saṃsthā of Rāmañña Nikāya which is the most strict forest tradition in Sri Lanka.

==Resistance to Modernization==
Though it has been impossible to resist completely, many old and simple traditions have been still survived in Rāmañña Nikāya. The monks of the Nikaya can be distinguished by the traditions such as using palm leaf umbrellas and alms bowls and covering both shoulders while traveling. &quot;Ramanna nikaya had its own distinctive style. They used begging bowls instead of plates. Instead of umbrellas, they used folded palmyrah leaves, in the form of “bogava”. The bogava introduced by Ven. Ambagahawatte Thero was made usable by CB Nugawela, chairman of the Up country Sabha for the Protection of Nikaya. They wore robes that were dyed according to the traditional rules.&quot;

==Forest Dwelling and Meditation Practice==
Many of the well known &#x27;Forest Meditation Masters&#x27; and &#x27;Forest Monasteries&#x27; are said to be in the former Rāmañña Nikāya. Most ven. Puwakdandawe Paññānanda Maha Thera was the pioneer of forest dwellers of Rāmañña Nikāya. Most ven. Kadavedduve Jinavamsa Maha Thera was a well-known founder of Śrī Kalyāṇī Yogāśrama Saṃsthā the major forest sect of Rāmañña Nikāya.

Most ven. Matara Sri Gnanarama Maha Thera, Most ven. Matale Silarakkhita Maha Thera. Most ven. Madawala dhammatilaka and Most Venerable Nauyane Ariyadhamma Mahāthēra were well-known meditation masters of Rāmañña Nikāya Forest Tradition.

<text>Earl Frederick Hilliard (born April 9, 1942) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Alabama who served as the U.S. representative for the state&#x27;s 7th district. He served in the Alabama House of Representatives and the Alabama Senate. His son Earl Hilliard Jr. is also a politician.

==Early life ==
Hilliard was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and graduated from Morehouse College.

==Career==
He was elected as a Democrat to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1974, serving until his election to the Alabama Senate in 1980. He served in the upper house until his election to Congress.

Hilliard was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1992 from the 7th District, a 65 percent black-majority district stretching from Birmingham to Montgomery. In the process, he became the first Black person since Jeramiah Haralson in 1877 to represent Alabama in Congress. He also became the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of the capital since 1965.

He faced his first serious challenge from Artur Davis in the 2000 Democratic primary election—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—but prevailed.

Davis challenged Hilliard again in 2002 in a district that had been changed significantly by redistricting. The 7th lost its share of Montgomery, and was pushed further into Birmingham, absorbing a large number of mostly white precincts in that city. The campaign that year was focused on Hilliard&#x27;s record in office and alleged ethical issues, as well as race, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and terrorism. Hilliard claimed &quot;the only thing&quot; that Davis, also an African American, had done for African Americans was &quot;put them in jail&quot; during his time as a federal prosecutor.

In 2001, Hilliard voted against a bill funding increases in military support to Israel and opposing criminalization of Palestinian politicians. A third candidate also ran in the Democratic primary, and Hilliard finished with the most votes but failed to win a majority; under Alabama law, he then faced a rematch with second-place finisher Davis in a run-off election. Davis won the run-off with 54% of the vote.

Hilliard is a 1960 graduate of Western-Olin High School in Birmingham. He received a B.A. in 1964 from Morehouse College, a J.D. in 1967 from Howard University, and an M.B.A. in 1970 from Atlanta University.

He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is a member of the board of the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.

Hilliard&#x27;s son, Earl Hilliard Jr., is a former member of the Alabama House of Representatives who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2010, also in the 7th district.

<text>Patrick Yvonne Hugo Dewael (; born 13 October 1955) is a liberal Belgian politician. A member of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (&quot;Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&quot;, VLD), he served as Minister-President of Flanders from 1999 to 2003.

He is the nephew of the late Herman Vanderpoorten and the cousin of Marleen Vanderpoorten, who served as Minister of Education in the Flemish Government led by Dewael. He obtained a degree in law and notariat from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Brussels. Dewael served as the President of the Chamber of Representatives from 2019 to 2020 and previously from 2008 to 2010.

==Political career==
He was first elected to the Belgian Parliament in 1985. From 1985 to 1992 Dewael served for the PVV as Flemish minister of Culture in the governments led by Gaston Geens (II, III and IV). After the defeat of the liberals at the 1992 elections, Dewael served as an opposition MP until the liberals regained power in 1999.

He was Minister-President of the regional government of Flanders from 1999 to 2003. After the Federal elections of 2003, Dewael resigned as minister-president in order to serve as deputy prime minister and minister of the interior in the Belgian Federal government led by Guy Verhofstadt.

When Kurdish militant Fehriye Erdal was sentenced to 4 years&#x27; imprisonment by a Bruges court on 28 February 2006, it turned out that she had shaken off the Belgian secret service, which had had the responsibility of following her since 23 February 2006 (Erdal had been under house arrest since 2000). Both the Minister of Justice, Laurette Onkelinx, and the Minister of the Interior, Patrick Dewael came under fire for this incident.

He was deputy prime minister and minister for interior in the Leterme I Government, which took office on 20 March 2008. On 31 December 2008, he became president of the Chamber of Representatives. He was replaced as interior minister by Guido De Padt.

<doc id="973312" wikidata="Q152487" url="?curid=973312" title="Steatopygia">
<text>Steatopygia is the state of having substantial levels of tissue on the buttocks and thighs. This build is not confined to the gluteal regions, but extends to the outside and front of the thighs, and tapers to the knee producing a curvilinear figure. The term is from the Greek (), meaning &quot;tallow&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;rump&quot;.

Steatopygia, a genetic phenotype leading to increased accumulation of adipose tissue in the buttock region, is most notably (but not solely) found among the Khoisan of Southern Africa. It has also been observed among Pygmies of Central Africa and also the Andamanese people, such as the Onge tribe in the Andaman Islands. This genetic characteristic is prevalent among women but occurs to a lesser degree in men.

It has been suggested that this feature was once more widespread. Paleolithic Venus figurines, sometimes referred to as &quot;Steatopygian Venus&quot; figures, discovered from Europe to Asia presenting a remarkable development of the thighs, and even the prolongation of the labia minora, have been used to support this theory. Whether these were intended to be lifelike, exaggeratory, or idealistic is unclear. These figures, however, may not qualify as steatopygian, since they exhibit an angle of approximately 120 degrees between the back and the buttocks, while steatopygia is typically described with an angle of about 90 degrees only. The dynamics of biomechanical movement will differ depending on the pelvic morphology by the same principle. The fascia anatomy of the sides of the sacral diamond area, which regulates its shape and movement, corresponds to the fascial thickenings that are part of the sacral complex of the thoracambular fascia, which surrounds the sacroiliac joints both posterioly and, from the iliolumbar ligaments anteriorly. The biochemical properties of the bands would have repercussions from the inside to the outside and vice-versa. The shape of the posterior muscular and adipose tissues seems to correspond with the general pelvic morphology. The classification is as follows: the gynecoid pelvis corresponds to a round buttocks shape, the platypelloid pelvis to a triangle shape, the anthropoid pelvis to a square shape and the android pelvis to a trapezoidal gluteus region. The trapezoidal shape is what gives steotopygia its specific shape and appearance; if anything, steatopygia is a trapezoidal figure from front, sideways and the back.

Steotopygia increases the risk of gigarntomastia in females and ginocormastia in males. It is also associated with inflammation to the genital area causing larger labia minora and labia majora in females&quot; macronypha&quot; and giving males a larger penile girth and length. Steotopygia gives a aggressive athletic pear shape and traingle figure .Also gives a infantile oval and round face to both females and males.

In Georgian England, freak shows were known to have exploited women with steatopygia. The most well-known example was a South African Khoekhoe woman named Sarah Baartman, who is thought to have had lipedema.

==Distribution and geography==

Steotopygia is notably found in all people who are of full afrodescent. Groups like the khoisan, pygmy , nilotic , sandawe, hadza and notably bantu speaking like shona, venda, kalanga, tswana, tonga, chichewa, ndau, ndebele, sotho, xhosa , nambaya , hutu and many more bantu speaking groups indigenous to central africa and southern africa. Then there are onge people andamanese island a austranesian group.

==Causes and genetics==

Steatopygia is the relationship between the android auxilla and the femur and various fat genes are included for variation. Steatopygia is found in both male and female people of afrodescent. Steatopygia is a phenotype that African subracial groups kept from ancient humans when they started walking on two feet. Steotopygia forms a default triangle shape body build regardless of the body weight meaning even being severely underweight keep a triangle shape body for both male and female.

== Contemporary debates ==

Modern understanding of steatopygia is not connected solely to genetic markers. Historical perspective on race-influenced steatopygia was used for sexualizing people such as &quot;Hottentot Venus.&quot;

<doc id="973317" wikidata="Q1032063" url="?curid=973317" title="HMS Monmouth (1901)">
<text>HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot; was the name ship of her class of 10 armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. The ships were also known as the County Cruisers (each being named after a British county).

She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion in 1903. She was transferred to the China Station in 1906, and remained there until she returned home in 1913 and was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet. When World War I began in August 1914, the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron in the Central Atlantic to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping. She was detached upon arrival to patrol the Brazilian coast for German ships, and was later ordered to the South Atlantic to join Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock&#x27;s squadron in their search for the German East Asia Squadron. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock&#x27;s force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock&#x27;s two armoured cruisers in the Battle of Coronel. &quot;Monmouth&quot; was lost with all hands.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Monmouth&quot;s were intended to protect British merchant shipping from fast cruisers like the French , or the es. The ships were designed to displace . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft using steam provided by 31 Belleville boilers. The engines produced a total of which was designed to give the ships a maximum speed of . &quot;Monmouth&quot;, however, was one of three of the ships of the class that failed to meet their designed speed. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class ships&#x27; main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) Mk VII guns. Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and the others were positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. &quot;Monmouth&quot; also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Monmouth&quot;, named for the Welsh county, was laid down by London and Glasgow Shipbuilding at their shipyard in Govan on 29 August 1899, and launched on 13 November 1901. Her completion was delayed due to a collision with the liner &quot;Assyria&quot; in Glasgow harbour in late March 1902. She arrived at Devonport in late August that year for trials, but was not finally completed and accepted until 2 December 1903, when she was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. She was briefly placed in reserve in Devonport at the end of January 1906, before being recommissioned in April for service on the China Station. During 1913 &quot;Monmouth&quot; paid a courtesy visit to the German treaty port of Tsingtao on the Chinese Mainland. Later in the same year she returned home and was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet.

She was mobilised on 4 August 1914 with a crew of 738 personnel consisting of 570 ratings and 29 officers in addition to 25 members of the Royal Marine band and 69 Royal Marines. In many sources, it is stated her crew mostly consisted of reservists; however, based on the ship&#x27;s crew list, only 8 crew members were part of the Royal Navy Reserve in addition to 69 members of the Coast Guard. Post mobilisation, she was sent to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart on the Cape Verde – Canary Islands station. Upon her arrival on 13 August, Stoddart detached her to the Brazilian coast to search for the German light cruisers known to be in the area. She came under Cradock&#x27;s command in mid-September. At the end of September, Cradock made his first fruitless search of the Tierra del Fuego area and later detached &quot;Monmouth&quot; and two other ships to search up the Chilean coast, reaching Valparaiso on 15 October, while his flagship, returned to Port Stanley, in the Falkland Islands, to recoal and to reestablish communications with the Admiralty. He received word on 7 October that German Vice Admiral Spee&#x27;s ships were definitely bound for the Cape Horn region and waited for the elderly predreadnought battleship to reinforce his squadron. She was in poor mechanical condition when she arrived at Port Stanley and required time to make repairs. &quot;Good Hope&quot; sailed on 22 October without her, going around Cape Horn, while &quot;Canopus&quot; and three colliers departed the following day, taking the shorter route through the Strait of Magellan.

===Battle of Coronel===
&quot;Good Hope&quot; rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron at Vallenar Roads, in the remote Chonos Archipelago of Chile on 27 October 1914 to recoal. They departed two days later, just as &quot;Canopus&quot; arrived, Cradock ordering the battleship to follow as soon as possible. He sent the light cruiser to scout ahead and to enter Coronel, Chile to pick up any messages from the Admiralty and acquire intelligence regarding German activities. The cruiser began to pick up German radio signals from the light cruiser on the afternoon of 29 October, and delayed entering Coronel for two days with Cradock&#x27;s permission to avoid being trapped by the fast German ships. A German supply ship was already there and radioed Spee that &quot;Glasgow&quot; had entered the harbour around twilight. The cruiser departed on the morning of 1 November, but Spee had already made plans to catch her when informed of her presence the previous evening.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; departed Coronel at 09:15 after having picked up the squadron&#x27;s mail, and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron four hours later. Cradock ordered his ships to form line abreast with a distance of between ships to maximise visibility at 13:50 and steered north at a speed of . At 16:17 &quot;Leipzig&quot; spotted &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the easternmost British ship, to its west and she spotted &quot;Leipzig&quot;″s funnel smoke three minutes later. At 17:10 Cradock ordered his ships to head for &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the closest ship to the Germans. Once gathered together, he formed them into line astern, with &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the lead, steering southeasterly at at 18:18. As the sixteen guns aboard the armoured cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and were only matched by the two 9.2-inch guns on his flagship, he needed to close the range to bring his more numerous 6-inch guns to bear. The Force 7 winds and high seas, however, prevented the use of half of those guns as they were too close to the water. He also wanted to use the setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind the German gunners. Spee was well aware of the British advantages and refused to allow Cradock to close the range. His ships were faster than the British, slowed by the 16-knot maximum speed of the armed merchant cruiser , and he opened up the range to until conditions changed to suit him. The sun set at 18:50, which silhouetted the British ships against the light sky while the German ships became indistinguishable from the shoreline behind them.

Spee immediately turned to close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04, when the range closed to . Spee&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, engaged &quot;Good Hope&quot; while &quot;Gneisenau&quot; fired at &quot;Monmouth&quot;. The German shooting was very accurate, with both armoured cruisers quickly scoring hits on their British counterparts while still outside six-inch gun range, starting fires on both ships. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee&#x27;s ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half of that when the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. One shell from &quot;Gneisenau&quot; blew the roof off &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s forward turret and started a fire, causing an ammunition explosion that completely blew the turret off the ship.
Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only away at 19:35. Severely damaged, &quot;Monmouth&quot; began to slow and veered out of line.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; fought almost an entirely separate battle as the German armoured cruisers ignored her almost completely and she inconclusively dueled the light cruisers &quot;Leipzig&quot; and . &quot;Glasgow&quot; broke contact with the German squadron at 20:05 and discovered &quot;Monmouth&quot;, listing and down by the bow, having extinguished her fires, 10 minutes later. She was trying to turn north to put her stern to the heavy northerly swell and was taking water at the bow. There was little that &quot;Glasgow&quot; could do to assist the larger ship as the moonlight illuminated both ships and the Germans were searching for them.

The light cruiser &quot;Nürnberg&quot; had been trailing the German squadron and spotted the plume of smoke from &quot;Glasgow&quot; at 20:35, and then saw &quot;Monmouth&quot; with a 10-degree list to port shortly afterwards. As &quot;Nürnberg&quot; closed the range, &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s list increased so that none of the guns on her port side could be used. The German cruiser closed to within and illuminated her flag with its spotlight in the hopes that she would strike her colours and surrender. There was no response from the British ship and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; opened fire at 21:20, aiming high, but there was still no response. The German ship then fired a torpedo which missed and turned off its searchlight. &quot;Monmouth&quot; then increased speed and turned towards &quot;Nürnberg&quot;, which caused her to open fire again. &quot;Monmouth&quot; capsized at 21:58, taking her entire crew of 734 men with her as the seas were too rough to attempt any rescue effort.

<text>HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; was one of seven armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1880s. She was sold for scrap on 5 April 1905.

==Design and description==
&quot;Galatea&quot; had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . Designed to displace , all of the &quot;Orlando&quot;-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately . The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by four boilers with forced draught. The ship carried a maximum of of coal which was designed to give her a range of at a speed of . The ship&#x27;s complement was 484 officers and ratings.

&quot;Galatea&quot;″s main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.

The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded. The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads . The lower deck was thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Galatea&quot;, named for the eponymous figure from Greek legend, was laid down on 21 April 1885 by Robert Napier and Sons at their shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. The ship was launched on 10 March 1887, and completed in March 1889.

She held a continuous commission as coast guard ship at Humber district based at Hull from 3 May 1893 until February 1903. On 12 May 1894, a six-pounder blank round exploded when &quot;Galatea&quot; was saluting ships of the German fleet at Firth of Forth. One of the ship&#x27;s crew was killed and another badly injured, having to have an arm amputated. On the night of 10/11 February 1898, &quot;Galatea&quot; was at anchor on the Humber when the steamer &quot;Marbella&quot;, carrying a cargo of racehorses, collided with the cruiser. The steamer sank within ten minutes, but &quot;Marbella&quot;″s crew and the single passenger safely evacuated to &quot;Galatea&quot; before the steamer sank, although all the racehorses were lost. Captain Charles Henry Cross was appointed in command in September 1898, and was briefly succeeded by Captain Richard William White in March–April 1900, during which she escorted the royal yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; with Queen Victoria on a visit to Ireland. From April that year Captain Robert Dalrymple Barwick Bruce was in command. She was under the command of Captain Robert Stevenson Dalton Cuming from February 1902 until February 1903, during which she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and visited Copenhagen the following month.

<text>HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; was one of eight light cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. She fought in the First World War, participating in the Battle of Jutland. Following the war, she was scrapped.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class cruisers were intended to lead destroyer flotillas and defend the fleet against attacks by enemy destroyers. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a deep draught of . Displacement was at normal and at full load. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of . The turbines used steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about . She carried tons of fuel oil that gave a range of at .

The main armament of the &quot;Arethusa&quot;-class ships was two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and six QF 4-inch Mk V guns in waist mountings. They were also fitted with a single QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft gun and four  torpedo tubes in two twin mounts.

==Service history==
She was launched on 14 May 1914 at William Beardmore and Company shipyard. On her commissioning she was assigned as the leader to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Harwich Force, guarding the eastern approaches to the English Channel. On 4 May 1916, she took part in the shooting down of Zeppelin &quot;L 7&quot;. At the Battle of Jutland, she was the flagship of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron under Commodore E.S. Alexander-Sinclair. She was the first ship to report the presence of German ships, triggering the battle. &quot;Galatea&quot; was also the first to receive a hit by the German light cruiser , but no explosion occurred. She was sold for scrapping on 25 October 1921. Mount Galatea in Alberta, Canada is named after this ship.

<text>Howard West Kilvinton Mowll (2 February 1890 – 24 October 1958) was the Anglican Bishop of Western China from 1925 to 1933, and Archbishop of Sydney from 1933 until his death in 1958.

== Biography ==
Mowll was born in Dover and attended Dover College until 1903 and later matriculated at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury.

He succeeded William Cassels in 1926 as Bishop of Western China. As a staunch evangelical, upon returning from the mission field of Western China (Sichuan), Mowll experienced early difficulties in a predominantly liberal church before rising to national prominence during the war years. In 1947 he was elected Primate of Australia.

Within a month of World War 2 starting he had formed the Church of England National Emergency Fund, (CENEF), which was supported with volunteers and fundraising by the Sydney Diocesan Churchwomen&#x27;s Association. CENEF funded huts for recreation and chaplains in military camps around Sydney, as well as at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney and other churches around Sydney. To continue to help ex service people after the war and youth work, CENEF raised funds to buy 201 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, and Rathane in the Royal National Park. CENEF leveraged the Castlereagh Street building to buy land at Gilbulla and 117 acres in Castle Hill for a retirement village. This retirement village was one of his great achievements (some say his wife Dorothy was the driving force behind the idea), and became the first retirement village in Australia. Today this site remains the flagship for Anglican Retirement Villages, Diocese of Sydney. In 1947, following the War, he was elected Primate of Australia.

<text>St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral is the Roman Catholic cathedral for the diocese of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Built in the High Victorian Gothic style, St. Andrew&#x27;s was Victoria&#x27;s third cathedral to be built.

==History==
The cathedral is the third building to be used by the parish. The first building was used from 1858 to 1884 (presently used as the Chapel of St. Ann&#x27;s Academy on Humboldt Street). The second building was used from 1884 to 1892 (situated behind the current building now occupied by the St. Andrew&#x27;s Square office building), after which the parish moved into the present cathedral.

Work on the new cathedral began in 1890. At 8:00 a.m. on October 30, 1892, Bishop Jean-Nicolas Lemmens blessed the building before celebrating a Pontifical High Mass at 10:00 a.m. The cathedral has been a National Historic Site of Canada since 1990.

==Design==
The present cathedral was designed by architects Maurice Perrault and Albert Mesnard. The total cost of the building was C$81,052. Based on the plans for a church built in Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec, Perrault and Mesnard borrowed much from the medieval architecture of European churches. The double asymmetrical towers are typical of Quebec churches and a characteristic of the High Victorian Gothic style. This was an attempt to follow the &quot;unfinished&quot; look that made fourteenth and fifteenth century churches popular. The main tower boasts a spire that was designed to hold a clock and a set of bells.

The nave is , with a rose window. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St Andrew&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral. The cathedral houses 21 large Portland-style stained glass windows and two large rose windows with a smaller one above the gallery.

An altar was commissioned for use on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Bishop Remi Joseph De Roo&#x27;s episcopal ordination. Carved by Charles W. Elliott, the first Native American to graduate from St. Louis College, the altar consists of two bentwood boxes. The boxes can be rotated to show four separate designs for the different liturgical seasons. The top of the altar or is carved from yellow cedar (Nootka Cypress) and weighs approximately .

The cathedral also displays a carved lectern by artist Roy Henry Vickers. It depicts a black and red image of Christ, representing the crucified Christ and the risen Christ.

===Crypt===
The cathedral houses a crypt, where three of Victoria&#x27;s former Bishops are interred:

* Bishop Modeste Demers, the first Bishop of Victoria.
* Charles John Seghers, the second and fourth Bishop, murdered in Alaska.
* Rt. Rev. John J. Jonckau, a former Vicar General of the Diocese of Victoria who was named as Bishop but died before being consecrated.

<text>This article lists rivers by their average discharge measured in descending order of their water flow rate. Here, only those rivers whose discharge is more than are shown. It can be thought of as a list of the biggest rivers on Earth, measured by a specific metric. 

For context, the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool is . The average flow rate at the mouth of the Amazon is sufficient to fill more than 83 such pools each second. The estimated global total for all rivers is (43 million cu ft/s), of which the Amazon would be approximately 18%.

==List of primary rivers by discharge==

The global annual runoff into the oceans (38,500–44,200 km3/year) is dominated by runoff into the South Atlantic from eastern South America, into the western Pacific from east Asia, and into the Indian Ocean from India, and southeast Asia. Depending on the estimate, the Amazon alone accounts for 15–18% of the annual freshwater runoff into the oceans.

<doc id="973346" wikidata="Q5632606" url="?curid=973346" title="HMS Grampus (1802)">
<text>HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; was a 50-gun fourth-rate ship of the line of the &quot;Diomede&quot; class of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1802

==Napoleonic Wars==
She was commissioned in March 1803 at Portsmouth by Captain Hugh Downman, but in the following month command passed to Captain Thomas Gordon Caulfield. The ship was completed on 11 April 1803 and was ordered to the Downs on 7 May. As soon as her complement of men was completed and her bounty paid she sailed to join Admiral Edward Thornbrough&#x27;s squadron off Goree.

On 19 May 1803 &quot;Jalouse&quot; captured &quot;Jong Jan Pieter&quot;. &quot;Jalouse&quot; shared the prize money with &quot;Grampus&quot; and the gun-brigs and , with whom she had been in company.

&quot;Grampus&quot; returned to Portsmouth from Guernsey on 20 June to fit out for the East Indies and sailed with a convoy under her protection on 29 June. She carried £100,000 that the British East India Company was shipping to Bengal. On 16 October she was three days out of Rio and in company with the 74-gun third rate ship of the line . The East Indiamen they were escorting were &quot;Northampton&quot;, &quot;Lord Melville&quot;, , &quot;Princess Mary&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Ann&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot;. &quot;Grampus&quot; spent 1805 in the East Indies.

In March 1806 Captain James Haldane Tait took command of &quot;Grampus&quot;, leaving HMS &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, while &quot;Grampus&quot; was employed in India. Later she was stationed at the Cape of Good Hope, and returned home in the summer of 1809, escorting a large convoy of East India Company ships that Captain Tait had taken under his protection at St. Helena. He was presented by the Court of directors with a sum of money for the purchase of a piece of plate. &quot;Grampus&quot; was paid off because of her poor condition at the end of 1809.

&quot;Grampus&quot; underwent a repair and refit at Chatham between then and February 1810; in January 1810 she was recommissioned under the command of Captain William Hanwell.

On 28 April 1811 &quot;Grampus&quot; joined an East India convoy to see them through to the coast of Africa. On 30 September, back at Portsmouth, a court martial was convened on board in Sheerness harbour to try Lieutenant John Cheshire of &quot;Grampus&quot;. Captain Hanwell accused him of insolence, contempt, and disrespect on 11 April and similar conduct, coupled with neglect of duty, on 15 April. The court found the charges unfounded and acquitted Lieutenant Cheshire.

In November 1811 Commodore George Cockburn hoisted his broad pendant on board &quot;Grampus&quot;, preparatory to proceeding as one of three commissioners (the others were Thomas Sydenham and John Philip Morier) nominated by the Prince Regent to mediate between Spain and her colonies. They received final instructions on 2 April 1812, and arrived in Cádiz on 21 April to find the Spanish government and the majority of the Cortes resolved to retain absolute control over their South American possessions instead of taking a liberal view as proposed by the British government. He returned from his unsuccessful mission on 4 August.

==Post-war and fate==

In 1816 &quot;Grampus&quot; was taken out of commission at Woolwich, where she was converted to a troopship and then used as a hospital ship at Deptford from 1820 until being lent to the Society for Destitute Seamen at Deptford in 1824. She served as a hospital ship until 1831. The society relocated at this time to and in due course provided the foundation for the UK&#x27;s Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Seamen&#x27;s Dreadnought Hospital at Greenwich Hospital, later relocated to St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital.

<text>HMS &quot;Nautilus was a of the [[Royal Navy]]. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 March 1910 from [[Thames Ironworks &amp; Shipbuilding Company]]. She was renamedHMS &quot;Grampus on 16 December 1913, her former name being reallocated to , the first Royal Navy submarine to be given one.

==Service history==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; joined the First Destroyer Flotilla when she commissioned on 12 September 1911, replacing the .

During the First World War, &quot;Grampus&quot; participated in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire.

On 17 April 1915, in an attempt to break through the Dardanelles, the submarine ran aground under Kephaz Point. She was fired on and disabled, her captain, Lieutenant Commander T. S. Brodie and several of her crew were killed; the remainder taken prisoner. To prevent her capture, the Royal Navy tried over the next two days to destroy the submarine. &quot;Grampus&quot; was involved in one of the many failed attempts; she was simply unable to locate &quot;E15&quot;.

On 6 August, HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; landed 11th Battalion, The Manchester Regiment of the 11th (Northern) Division inside Suvla Bay, but on the wrong part of the beach. The troops were ill-supplied and ran critically short of drinking water in the actions that followed; on 8 August, HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; cut one of her own water tanks loose and floated it ashore, which allowed the men who recovered it about a pint (0.5 litre) each.

&quot;Grampus&quot; was sold Thos. W. Ward for scrapping at Rainham, Kent on 21 September 1920.

<text>HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; (N56) was the lead ship of her class of mine-laying submarine of the Royal Navy. She was built at Chatham Dockyard and launched on 25 February 1936. She served in World War II off China before moving to the Mediterranean Sea. She was sunk with all hands by the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; on 16 June 1940.

On 16 June 1940, under the command of Lieutenant Commander C. A. Rowe, &quot;Grampus&quot; laid mines in the Syracuse and Augusta, Sicily area. She was seen by the Italian torpedo boat &quot;Circe&quot;, which was on anti-submarine patrol with , , and &quot;Polluce&quot;. Within a very short time, &quot;Grampus&quot; was destroyed. Wreckage came to the surface along with air bubbles and oil. &quot;Polluce&quot; was credited with the kill. There were no survivors. Some sources give the date of this action as 24 June 1940.

<text>Jumacao a.k.a. Jumaca (born &quot;c&quot;. 1480s) was the Taíno Cacique (Chief) of the area in Puerto Rico named after him (now spelled Humacao).

==Before and after the arrival of the Conquistadors==
The Taínos, who lived in Puerto Rico long before the arrival of the Spaniards, were an organized and peaceful people. The only problems they had were occasionally with the cannibals of the Carib tribes. The Cacique was the head of the tribe and the governor of his region. They reported to the &quot;Supreme Cacique&quot;, who during Jumacao&#x27;s time was the Cacique Agueybana. When the Spaniards arrived, Agueybana received Juan Ponce de León with open arms. This extended friendship was soon to end because the Conquistadores started to enslave the Taínos and to destroy their way of life.

==Taíno revolt==

According to the &quot;Chronicles of the Indias&quot;, which are kept in Seville, Spain, in February 1511, Agueybana&#x27;s brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), Urayoan, the Cacique of Añasco and some of their men drowned the Spanish soldier Diego Salcedo. They watched over Salcedo&#x27;s body to see if he came back to life. When he did not, the Taínos realized that the Spaniards were not gods after all.

When the news spread among the Taínos, they started a rebellion and attacked some Spanish settlements. After Ponce de León&#x27;s troops killed the Cacique Agueybana II, the Spanish Government reached an agreement and signed a peace treaty. However, the Spaniards in the island did not respect the treaty and continued to enslave and destroy many of the Taíno villages.

The Cacique Jumacao was the first Cacique to learn how to read and write in Spanish. He proved this by writing a letter to King Charles I of Spain, complaining that the appointed governor of the island was not honoring the peace treaty and that he and the other Caciques had virtually become prisoners of the governor. He also stated that he was responsible of his own acts. The King was moved by the letter and ordered the governor to honor the terms of the treaty.

The government, however, paid no attention to the King&#x27;s request and continued to abuse the Taínos. Jumacao, together with the help of the Cacique Daguao (Cacique of Naguabo), attacked Spanish settlements and burned down the City of Santiago (founded in 1513), which was located close to the Daguao (now Santiago) River, killing all of its inhabitants. According to the testimony of Ignacio Martinez, the sole survivor of the &quot;Santiago incident&quot;, the Caciques and their tribes hid in the Sierras (mountains) of Luquillo. Jumacao was never heard from again.

==Legacy==
There is a statue of the Cacique in the city of Humacao. In 1975 the city of Humacao honored the Cacique Jumacao by including a crown within its Municipal Coat of Arms, which represents the royalty of the Cacique. The City of Humacao also presents the &quot;Cacique Jumacao Award&quot; to the best industries in regard to its recycling programs.

<text>HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; (S04) was a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine. Her keel was laid down in 1955 by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead. She was launched by Lady Shepheard on 30 May 1957. She was first commissioned on 19 December 1958.

==Service==
On 1 April 1963, &quot;Grampus&quot; returned to Gosport after spending three weeks under the polar icecap looking for holes in the ice. During the patrol she superficially damaged her hull on the ice. During 1965 she refitted in Devonport Dockyard.

In 1964 she was commanded by Lieutenant-Commander J F Woodward RN.

On 11 January 1968, the French trawler &quot;Fomalhaut&quot; caught &quot;Grampus&quot; in her nets in the English Channel. &quot;Grampus&quot; surfaced and both crews spent over three hours disentangling the nets. In 1968 she was part of the First Submarine Squadron based at HMS Dolphin and in that year was present during &#x27;Navy Days&#x27; in Portsmouth Dockyard.

&quot;Grampus&quot; operated with USS &quot;Tigrone&quot; in a joint American-British oceanographic operation in the eastern Atlantic in 1972.

&quot;Grampus&quot; sank on 18 September 1980 in Loch Fyne as she was being towed as a sonar target. She sits upright in 120 metres of water.

<text>Transfeminism, or trans feminism, is a branch of feminism focused on transgender women and informed by transgender studies. Transfeminism focuses on the effects of transmisogyny and patriarchy on trans women. It is related to the broader field of queer theory. The term was popularized by Emi Koyama (involved in the ISNA) in &quot;The Transfeminist Manifesto.&quot;

Transfeminism describes the concepts of gender nonconformity, notions of masculinity and femininity and the maintaining of sex and gender binary on trans men and women. Transfeminists view gender conformity as a control mechanism of patriarchy, which is maintained via violence against transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals as a basis of patriarchy.

Tactics of transfeminism emerged from groups such as &quot;The Transexual Menace&quot; (name from the Lavender Menace) in the 1990s, in response to exclusion of transgender people in Pride marches. The group organized in direct action, focusing on violence against transgender people, such as the murder and rape of Brandon Teena, a trans man. The Transsexual Menace organized protests and sit ins against the medical and mental pathologization of trans people.

Trans people were generally excluded from first wave feminism, as were lesbians and all other people considered &quot;queer.&quot; Second wave feminism saw greater level of acceptance amongst some feminists, however &quot;transsexuality&quot; was heavily excluded, and described as an &quot;illness,&quot; even amongst feminists who supported gay liberation. Third and fourth wave feminism have generally been accepting of transgender people, and see trans liberation as an overall part of women&#x27;s liberation.

In 2006, the first book on transfeminism, &quot;Trans/Forming Feminisms: Transfeminist Voices Speak Out&quot; edited by Krista Scott-Dixon, was published by Sumach Press. Transfeminism has also been defined more generally as &quot;an approach to feminism that is informed by trans politics.&quot;

==History==
Early voices in the movement include Kate Bornstein, author of 1994 &quot;Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women, and the Rest of Us&quot;, and Sandy Stone, author of essay &quot;The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto&quot;, which included a direct response to Janice Raymond&#x27;s writings on transsexuality. In the 21st century, Krista Scott-Dixon and Julia Serano have published transfeminist works. Bornstein has also released new works, such as &quot;Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation&quot; in 2010 with S. Bear Bergman. Susan Stryker and Talia M. Bettcher have also recently released a publication about transfeminism.

Patrick Califia used the word in print in 1997, and this remains the first known use in print outside of a periodical. It is possible or even likely that the term was independently coined repeatedly before the year 2000 (or even before Courvant&#x27;s first claimed use in 1992). The term gained traction only after 1999. Jessica Xavier, an acquaintance of Courvant, may have independently coined the term when she used it to introduce her articles, &quot;Passing As Stigma Management&quot; and &quot;Passing as Privilege&quot; in late 1999.

In the past few decades, the idea that all women share a common experience has come under scrutiny by women of color, lesbians, and working class women, among others. Many transgender people are also questioning what gender means, and are challenging gender as a biological fact. Transfeminists insist that their unique experiences be recognized as part of the feminist sphere.

Transfeminism incorporates all major themes of third wave feminism, including diversity, body image, self-definition, and women&#x27;s agency. It also includes critical analysis of second wave feminism from the perspective of the third wave. It critiques mainstream notions of masculinity and argues that women deserve equal rights and shares the unifying principle with other feminisms that gender is a patriarchal social construct used to oppress women. The &quot;trans&quot; in transgender has been used to imply transgressiveness. Nicholas Birns categorizes transfeminism as &quot;a feminism that defines the term &#x27;trans-&#x27; in a maximally heterogeneous way.&quot;

The road to legitimacy for transfeminism as a concept has been different and more vexed than for other feminisms. Marginalized women of trans background and affect have had to prove that their needs are different and that mainstream feminism does not necessarily speak for them. Contrarily, trans women must show their womanhood is equally valid as that of other women, and that feminism can speak for them without ceasing to be feminism. Radical feminist Janice Raymond&#x27;s resistance to considering trans women as women and as participants in feminism is representative of this obstacle. Her career began with &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot; (a book-length analysis of transsexual women) and she has often returned to this theme.

In 2006, the first book on transfeminism, &quot;Trans/Forming Feminisms: Transfeminist Voices Speak Out&quot; edited by Krista Scott-Dixon, was published by Sumach Press.

At the 2007 Transgender Leadership Summit, Alexis Marie Rivera, spoke about her personal experiences with transfeminism as a young Latina trans woman. She discussed her journey from early transition, where she believed she had to take on the role of housewife, to where she was in the present moment. She asserted that, for her, transfeminism is about taking on feminine gender roles because she wants to, not because she has to.

==Compared to other feminisms==

===Common foundations===
Simone de Beauvoir once said that biology does not and must not equal destiny. Feminists have traditionally explored the boundaries of what it means to be a woman. Transfeminists argue that trans people and cisgender feminists confront society&#x27;s conventional views of sex and gender in similar ways. Transgender liberation theory offers feminism a new vantage point from which to view gender as a social construct, even offering a new meaning of gender.

Transfeminist critics of mainstream feminism say that as an institutionalized movement, feminism has lost sight of the basic idea that biology is not destiny. In fact, they argue, many feminists seem perfectly comfortable equating sex and gender and insisting on a given destiny for trans persons based on nothing more than biology. Transfeminism aims to resist and challenge the fixedness of gender that, as many of its supporters believe, traditional approaches to women&#x27;s studies depend upon.

Transgender people are frequently targets of anti-trans violence. While cis women also routinely face violence, transfeminists recognize anti-trans violence as a form of gender policing.

===Differences===
Transfeminism stands in stark contrast to mainstream second-wave feminism. Transfeminists often criticize the ideas of a universal sisterhood, aligning more with intersectionality and with the mainstream third wave&#x27;s appreciation for the diversity of women&#x27;s experience.

According to Julia Serano femininity in transgender women is noticed and punished much more harshly than the same behaviors in cisgender women. This double standard reveals that the behavior itself is not as problematic to many critics as the existence of trans people. Julia Serano refers to the breed of misogyny experienced by trans women as &#x27;transmisogyny&#x27;.

====Access to feminist spaces====
Though little acknowledged, trans people have been part of feminist movements. There have been a number of documented occasions when the trans people portrayed as bad actors were in fact the victims of overreactions by others.

====Lesbian feminism and transfeminism====

In &quot;Living a Feminist Life&quot; (2017), Sara Ahmed imagines lesbian feminism as a fundamental and necessary alliance with trans feminism. Ahmed argues an anti-trans stance is an anti-feminist stance and one that works against the feminist project of creating worlds to support those for whom gender fatalism (i.e. boys will be boys, girls will be girls) is deleterious.

====Radical feminism and transfeminism====

Some radical feminists have expressed anti-trans viewpoints. For example, in &quot;Gender Hurts&quot; (2014), Sheila Jeffreys argued that trans feminism amounted to men exercising their authority in defining what women are.

Some radical feminists are supportive of trans rights. The radical feminist writer and activist Andrea Dworkin, in her book &quot;Woman Hating&quot;, argued against the persecution and hatred of transgender people and demanded that sex reassignment surgery be provided freely to transgender people by the community. Dworkin argued that &quot;every transsexual has the right to survival on his/her own terms. That means every transsexual is entitled to a sex-change operation, and it should be provided by the community as one of its functions.&quot;

====Allegations of transphobia in radical feminism====

Radical feminist Janice Raymond&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot;, was and still is controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transgender surgeries. Raymond says, &quot;All transsexuals rape women&#x27;s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.&quot;

In the early 1990s Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival ejected a transgender woman, Nancy Burkholder, After that, the festival maintained that it is intended for &quot;womyn-born-womyn&quot; only. The activist group Camp Trans formed to protest the transphobic &quot;womyn-born-womyn&quot; policy and to advocate for greater acceptance of trans people within the feminist community. A number of prominent trans activists and transfeminists were involved in Camp Trans including Riki Wilchins, Jessica Xavier, and Leslie Feinberg. The festival considered allowing post-operative trans women to attend; however, this was criticized as classist, as many trans women cannot afford genital surgery. Since this incident, the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival has updated their community statements page. This page now includes a list of links to letters and statements such as their August 2014 response to Equality Michigan&#x27;s Call For Boycott and a list of demands in response to the Equality Michigan call to boycott. The initial response to the boycott states that the MWMF believes that &quot;support for womyn-born-female space is not at odds with standing with and for the transgender community&quot;.

Kimberly Nixon is a trans woman who volunteered for training as a rape crisis counselor at Vancouver Rape Relief in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1995. When Nixon&#x27;s transgender status was determined, she was expelled. The staff decided that Nixon&#x27;s status made it impossible for her to understand the experiences of their clients, and also required their clients to be genetically female. Nixon disagreed, disclosing her own history of partner abuse and sued for discrimination. Nixon&#x27;s attorneys argued that there was no basis for the dismissal, citing Diana Courvant&#x27;s experiences as the first publicly transgender woman to work in a women-only domestic violence shelter. In 2007 the Canadian Supreme Court refused to hear Nixon&#x27;s appeal, ending the case.

Transgender women such as Sandy Stone challenged the mainstream second-wave feminist conception of &quot;biological woman&quot;. Stone worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased. The debate continued in Raymond&#x27;s book, which devoted a chapter to criticism of &quot;the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist.&quot; Groups like Lesbian Organization of Toronto instituted &quot;womyn-born womyn only&quot; policies. A formal request to join the L.O.O.T. was made by a male-to-female transgender lesbian in 1978. In response, the organization voted to exclude trans women. During informal discussion, members of L.O.O.T expressed their outrage that in their view a &quot;sex-change he-creature...dared to identify himself as a woman and a lesbian.&quot; In their public response, L.O.O.T. wrote:

A woman&#x27;s voice was almost never heard as a woman&#x27;s voice—it was always filtered through men&#x27;s voices. So here a guy comes along saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be a girl now and speak for girls.&quot; And we thought, &quot;No you&#x27;re not.&quot; A person cannot just joined the oppressed by fiat.

=== Radical transfeminism ===
Some transgender women have been participants in lesbian feminism and radical feminism. A prominent example is Sandy Stone, a trans lesbian feminist who worked as a sound technician for the lesbian-feminist Olivia Records. In June and July 1977, when 22 feminists protested Stone&#x27;s participation, Olivia Records defended her employment by saying that Stone was a &quot;woman we can related to with comfort and trust&quot; and that she was &quot;perhaps even the Goddess-sent engineering wizard we had so long sought.&quot;

==Issues within transfeminism==

===Inclusion in mainstream feminism===
According to Graham Mayeda, women who identify as right-wing feel that issues of equality and female importance becomes less significant when the biology of trans people, specifically, male-to-female trans people, is mentioned. He noted that these feminists feel that the biological nature of trans-females confuse &quot;women only&quot; boundaries and could contradict or disrupt feminist goals of establishing a voice in a patriarchal world.

Groups such as the Lesbian Avengers accept trans women, while others reject them. The Violence Against Women Act now &quot;explicitly protects transgender and lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors&quot;, such that domestic violence centers, rape crisis centers, support groups, and other VAWA-funded services cannot turn away any person due to their sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation.

===Gender dysphoria===
Gender dysphoria describes the condition of people who experience significant dysphoria with the sex assignment that they were given at birth, or the gender roles associated with that sex. The term &quot;gender identity disorder&quot; (GID) is also frequently used especially in the formal diagnosis used amongst psychologists and physicians.
Gender identity disorder was classified as a medical disorder by the ICD-10 CM and DSM-4. The DSM-5 uses the less pathologizing term &quot;gender dysphoria&quot;, and the ICD-11 uses the term &quot;gender incongruence&quot;. Many transgender individuals, transfeminists and medical researchers support the declassification of GID because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance, reinforces the binary model of gender, and can result in stigmatization of transgender individuals. Many transfeminists and traditional feminists also propose that this diagnosis be discarded because of its potentially abusive use by people with power, and may argue that gender variation is the right of all persons. When arguing for the previous diagnostic category, pro-GID transfeminists typically concede past misuse of the diagnosis while arguing for greater professional accountability.

In many situations or legal jurisdictions, transgender people have insurance coverage for surgery only as a consequence of the diagnosis. Removal would therefore increase patient costs. In other situations, anti-discrimination laws which protect legally disabled people apply to transgender people only so long as a manifest diagnosis exists. In other cases, transgender people are protected by sex discrimination rules or as a separate category. This economic issue can split advocates along class lines.

At the 2006 Trans Identity Conference at the University of Vermont, Courvant presented an analysis of this controversy. She noted that &quot;eliminationists&quot; must decide whether their efforts to destigmatize trans people conflict with efforts to destigmatize mental illness and whether removing the GID category would actually help with the former, while disrupting the current, albeit limited, insurance regime. Conversely, &quot;preservationists&quot; must address the problem of faulty diagnoses and improper &quot;treatment&quot;. She proposed retaining the category and focusing efforts on legitimating mental illness and improving acceptance of trans people, leaving aside the diagnosis question.

===Social construction of gender===

Citing their common experience, many transfeminists directly challenge the idea that femininity is an entirely social construction. Instead, they view gender as a multifaceted set of diverse intrinsic and social qualities. For example, there are both trans and cis persons who express themselves in ways that differ from society&#x27;s expectations of feminine and masculine.

Talia M. Bettcher states in her 2014 essay &quot;Trapped in the Wrong Theory&quot; that &quot;while the actual appeal to native gender must be rejected from a transfeminist perspective, the socially constituted denial of realness must be taken with dead seriousness.&quot;

<text>Language immersion, or simply immersion, is a technique used in bilingual language education in which two languages are used for instruction in a variety of topics, including maths, science, or social studies. The languages used for instruction are referred to as the L1 and the L2 for each student, with L1 being the student&#x27;s native language and L2 being the second language to be acquired through immersion programs and techniques. There are different types of language immersion that depend on the age of the students, the classtime spent in L2, the subjects that are taught, and the level of participation by the speakers of L1.

Although programs differ by country and context, most language immersion programs have the overall goal of promoting bilingualism between the two different sets of language-speakers. In many cases, biculturalism is also a goal for speakers of the majority language (the language spoken by the majority of the surrounding population) and the minority language (the language that is not the majority language). Research has shown that such forms of bilingual education provide students with overall greater language comprehension and production of the L2 in a native-like manner, especially greater exposure to other cultures and the preservation of languages, particularly heritage languages.

== Background ==
Bilingual education has taken on a variety of different approaches outside the traditional &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; model of full submersion in an L2 without assistance in the L1. According to the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL), in 1971, there were only three immersion programs within the United States. As of 2011, there were 448 language immersion schools in the US, with the three main immersion languages of instruction being Spanish (45%), French (22%), and Mandarin (13%).

The first French-language immersion program in Canada, with the target language being taught as an instructional language, started in Quebec in 1965. Since the majority language in Quebec is French, English-speaking parents wanted to ensure that their children could achieve a high level of French as well as English in Quebec. Since then, French immersion has spread across the country and has led to the situation of French immersion becoming the most common form of language immersion in Canada so far. According to the survey by CAL in 2011, there are over 528 immersion schools in the US. Besides, language immersion programs have spread to Australia, Mainland China, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Hong Kong, which altogether offer more than 20 languages. The survey also showed that Spanish is the most common immersion language in language immersion programs in US. There are over 239 Spanish-language immersion programs in the US because of immigration from Spanish-speaking countries. The other two common immersion language programs in the US are French and Mandarin, which have 114 and 71 language immersion programs, respectively.
== Types of learners ==
Types of language immersion can be characterized by the total time students spend in the program and also by the students&#x27; age.

Types that are characterized by learning time:
* Total immersion: In total immersion, the language of instruction is the students&#x27; L2, meaning that students spent 100% of the school day in their L2. Some students find it difficult to understand more abstract and complex concepts when they are taught only via their L2.
* Partial immersion: In partial immersion programs, classtime is shared between the students&#x27; L1 and L2. In most cases, it is an even split of time between the languages. Some students prefer this type of language immersion.
* Two-way immersion: This type, which is also called bilingual immersion, is a way to integrate both students of the minority language and students of the majority language into the same classroom with the goal of academic excellence and bilingual proficiency for both student groups. In this type of language immersion, the instructional languages can be two languages, but only one language is used at a time. Students learn languages by the interaction with their peers and teachers. This method of language immersion is popular language in America.
Types that are characterized by age:
* Early immersion: Students start learning their second language at the age of 5 or 6.
* Middle immersion: Students start learning their second language at the age of around 9 or 10.
* Late immersion: Students start learning their second language after the age of 11.

The stages of immersion can also be divided into:
* Early total immersion: education in L2 at 90-100%, usually beginning in kindergarten or on first grade.
* Early partial immersion: education in L2 at 50%, usually beginning in kindergarten or on first grade.
* Middle (or delayed) total immersion: education in L2 at 90%, usually beginning on fourth grade.
* Middle (or delayed) partial immersion: education in L2 at 50%, usually beginning on fourth grade.
* Late total immersion: education in L2 at 80%, usually beginning on sixth or seventh grade.
* Late partial immersion: education in L2 at 50%, usually beginning on sixth or seventh grade.

== Types of instruction ==
* In &quot;foreign language experience or exploratory&quot; (FLEX) programs, students are exposed to a different language(s) and culture(s) in the classroom. A small percentage of class time is spent sampling one or more languages and/or learning about language and so proficiency in the target language is not the primary goal. The goals of the program are to develop careful listening skills, cultural and linguistic awareness, and interest in foreign languages for future language study, as well as to learn basic words and phrases in one or more foreign languages.
* In &quot;foreign language in the elementary schools&quot; (FLES) programs, students focus on listening, reading, writing and speaking in the target language. In contrast to FLEX programs, proficiency in the target language is the primary goal, but a secondary goal is to expose students to the foreign language’s culture.
* In &quot;submersion&quot; programs, bilingual students generally receive all of their instruction in their L2. Such programs are often referred to &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; programs because there is little support for the students&#x27; L1.
* In &quot;two-way immersion&quot; programs, also called dual- or bilingual immersion, the student population consists of speakers of two or more languages. Two-way immersion programs in the US promote L1 speakers of a language other than English to maintain that language as well as to teach English as a second language (ESL). In addition, such programs allow L1 speakers of English to be immersed in a “foreign language acquisition environment.”
* In &quot;early-exit&quot; programs, bilingual students transition from a bilingual program to a mainstream classroom at an early age (around 7 or 8). Such programs are supported by the belief that bilingual children will benefit the most from transitioning into a mainstream classroom as early as possible.
* In &quot;late-exit&quot; programs, bilingual students transition from a bilingual program to a mainstream classroom at a later age (around 10 or 11). Such programs are supported by the belief that bilingual children will do better academically from being supported in both languages.

===Location===
People may also relocate temporarily to receive language immersion, which occurs when they move to a place (within their native country or abroad) where their native language is not the majority language of that community. For example, Canadian anglophones go to Quebec (see Explore and Katimavik), and Irish anglophones go to the Gaeltacht. Often, that involves a homestay with a family that speaks only the target language. Children whose parents emigrate to a new country also find themselves in an immersion environment with respect to their new language. Another method is to create a temporary environment in which the target language predominates, as in linguistic summer camps like the &quot;English villages&quot; in South Korea and parts of Europe.

Study abroad can also provide a strong immersion environment to increase language skills. However, many factors may affect immersion during study abroad, including the amount of foreign-language contact during the program. To impact competence in the target language positively, Celeste Kinginger notes, research about language learning during study abroad suggests &quot;a need for language learners&#x27; broader engagement in local communicative practices, for mindfulness of their situation as peripheral participants, and for more nuanced awareness of language itself.”

==Implementation==
The task of organizing and creating such a program can be daunting and problematic, with everything from planning to district budget posing issues. One method of implementation proposed by the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition is a phase-in method, which starts with the lowest year participating in the program as the only year and adds a new grade of students into the program each year, working up towards high school. 
This slow incorporation of an immersion program is useful for schools with limited funding and those who are skeptical about the benefits of such a program because it allows for yearly evaluation and, if it were to fail from the beginning, the impact of the loss is less significant.

The method of implementation is crucial to the success of the program, as the RAND Institute has concluded that the final result of these programs is positive, but only so long as implemented correctly, meaning consistency and strict adherence to the curriculum in the classroom.

== Stages of language acquisition ==
* Pre-production: also called &quot;the silent period,&quot; this period lasts 10 hours to 6 months in language immersion environment. Students may have about 500 receptive words in their mind but cannot speak the language yet. During this mimicking period, students are likely to repeat everything that they heard in class and can respond to pictures and yes-or-no questions by using their gestures like nodding or shaking their head. The class must integrate pictures and physical response methods.
* Early Production, in which students can master about 1000 receptive and active words, lasts six months after the pre-production stage. Students can answer simple questions, like yes-or-no questions. They also can repeat and use two-word phrases. They might not use patterns correctly, but they can discover the problem. This is a self-discovery period.
* Speech Emergence, in which students will have about 3000 active words, lasts one year after the early production stage. Students can answer simple questions and use three or more words in simple phrase and patterns. Students can understand the general idea of a story with pictures and may not be able to use the patterns correctly, but they can correct some of them by themselves. This is also called a self-correcting period. Teachers focus on conversations in class during this stage.
* Intermediate Fluency, in which students have nearly 6000 words in their active vocabulary. This stage lasts one year after speech emergence. Students start to use complex sentences in their speaking and writing and also know how to respond to other people&#x27;s questions. It is not hard for them to use the target language to learn math and science. Students are beginning to use more complex sentences when they speak and write, and they are willing to express opinions and share their thoughts. They ask questions to clarify what they are learning in class. More culture and literature is taught in this stage.
* Advanced Fluency (also called Continued Language Development), which requires students to know most content area vocabulary, lasts from 4 to 10 years. It is an achievement of cognitive academic language proficiency in the target language. Students&#x27; second-language ability has arrived to become near the native level.

== Outcomes ==
Studies have shown that students who study a foreign language in school, especially those who start in elementary school, tend to receive higher standardized test scores than students who have not studied a foreign language in school. According to additional research, learning another language can also help students do better in math, focusing, and remembering. Students who study foreign languages also tend to have increased mental capabilities, such as creativity and higher-order thinking skills (see cognitive advantages of bilingualism) and have advantages in the workplace, such as higher salary and a wider range of opportunities, since employers are increasingly seeking workers with knowledge of different languages and cultures. Bilingual immersion programs are intended to foster proficiency or fluency in multiple languages and therefore maximize these benefits. Even if fluency in the desired language is not fully attained, bilingual immersion programs provide a strong foundation for fluency later in life and help students gain appreciation of languages and cultures other than their own.

There are no long-term adverse effects of bilingual education on the learning of the majority language, regardless of whether the students&#x27; first language (L1) is a majority or a minority language or of the organization of the educational program. Several observed outcomes of bilingual education are the transfer of academic and conceptual knowledge across both languages, greater success in programs that emphasize biliteracy as well as bilingualism, and better developed second-language (L2) literary skills for minority students than if they received a monolingual education in the majority language.

Language immersion programs with the goal of fostering bilingualism, Canada&#x27;s French-English bilingual immersion program being one of the first, initially reported that students receive standardized test scores that are slightly below average. That was true in Canada&#x27;s program, but by Grade 5, there was no difference between their scores and the scores of students who were instructed only in English. The English spelling abilities soon matched those of the English-only students. Ultimately, students did not lose any proficiency in English and were able to develop native-like proficiency in French reading and comprehension but they did not quite reach native-like proficiency in spoken and written French. However, the immersion program is seen as providing a strong foundation for oral French fluency later in life, and other similar programs that might not fully reach their projected goals may also be seen in the same light.

Programs with the goal of preserving heritage languages, such as Hawaii&#x27;s language immersion program, have also reported initial outcomes of below-average test scores on standardized tests. However, the low test scores may not have been caused by purely language-related factors. For example, there was initially a lack of curriculum material written in Hawaiian, and many of the teachers were inexperienced or unaccustomed to teaching in Hawaiian. Despite the initial drawbacks, the Hawaiian program was overall successful in preserving Hawaiian as a heritage language, with students in the program being able to speak Hawaiian fluently while they learned reading, writing, and math, which were taught in Hawaiian.

Partial immersion programs do not have the initial lag in achievement of the programs of Canada and Hawaii but are less effective than full immersion programs, and students generally do not achieve native-like L2 proficiency.

== Issues ==
* The design of exposure time for each language
The first issue is the allocation of time given to each language. Educators have thought that more exposure to the students&#x27; L2 will lead to greater L2 proficiency, but it is difficult for students to learn abstract and complex concepts only by L2. Different types of language immersion schools allocate different time to each language, but there is still no evidence to prove that any particular way is best.

* The challenges of curriculum, instruction, and instructors

In the United States, state and local government only provide curriculum for teaching students in only one language. There is no standard curriculum for language-immersion schools.

Besides, the states do not provide assistance in how to promote biliteracy. Bilingual teaching has been too little researched. The report of the Council of the Great City Schools in 2013 has shown that half of the city schools lack professional bilingual teaching instructors.

* Bilingual proficiency

There are challenges to developing high proficiency in two languages or balance in bilingual skills, especially for early immersion students. Children complete the development of their first language by the age 7, and L1 and L2 affect each other during language development. High levels of bilingual proficiency are hard to achieve. Students with more exposure are better. For second-language immersion schools, immersion too early in a second language leads students to fail to be proficient in their first language.

== By country ==
=== Canada ===
As of 2009, about 300,000 Canadian students (roughly 6% of the school population) were enrolled in immersion programs. In early immersion, L1 English-speakers are immersed in French in their education for 2 to 3 years prior to formal English education. This early exposure prepares Canadian L1 English speakers for the 4th grade, when they begin to be instructed in English 50% of the time and French the other 50%.

=== United States ===
In the United States and since the 1980s, dual immersion programs have grown for a number of reasons: competition in a global economy, a growing population of second-language learners, and the successes of previous programs. Language immersion classes can now be found throughout the US, in urban and suburban areas, in dual-immersion and single-language immersion, and in an array of languages. As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs in US elementary schools, providing instruction in 10 languages, and 96% of those programs were in Spanish.

==== Hawaii ====

The 1970s marked the beginning of bilingual education programs in Hawaii. The Hawaiian Language Program was geared to promote cultural integrity by emphasizing native-language proficiency through heritage language bilingual immersion instruction. By 1995, there were 756 students enrolled in the Hawaiian Language Immersion Program from K to 8. The program was taught strictly in Hawaiian until Grades 5 and 6, when English was introduced as the language of instruction for one hour per day. The Hawaiian Language immersion Program is still in effect today for K-12. With an emphasis on language revival, Hawaiian is the main medium of instruction until Grade 5, when English is introduced but does not usurp Hawaiian as the main medium of instruction.

=== Mexico ===
A study by Hamel (1995) highlights a school in Michoacan, Mexico, which focuses on two bilingual elementary schools in which teachers built a curriculum that taught all subjects, including literature and math, in the children’s L1: P’urhepecha. Years after the curriculum was implemented in 1995, researchers conducted a study comparing L1 P’urhepecha students with L1 Spanish students. Results found that students who had acquired L1 P’urhepecha literacy performed better in both languages (P’urhepecha and Spanish) than students who were L1 Spanish literate.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand shows another instance of heritage bilingual immersion programs. Established in 1982, full Māori-language immersion education strictly forbids the use of English in classroom instruction even though English is typically the students&#x27; L1. That has created challenges for educators because of the lack of tools and underdeveloped bilingual teaching strategy for Māori.

=== Malawi and Zambia ===
A study by Williams (1996) looked at the effects bilingual education had on two different communities in Malawi and Zambia. In Malawi, Chichewa is the main language of instruction, and English is taught as a separate course. In Zambia, English is the main language of instruction, and the local language, Nyanja, is taught as a separate course. Williams&#x27;s study took children from six schools in each country in Grade 5. He administered two tests: an English-language reading test, and a mother-tongue reading test. One result showed that there was no significant difference in the English reading ability between the Zambian and Malawian school children. However, there were significant differences in the proficiency of mother tongue reading ability. The results of the study showed that the Malawian students did better in their mother tongue, Chichewa, than Zambian children did in their mother tongue, Nyanja.

<text>The Future Systems project (FS) was a research and development project undertaken in IBM in the early 1970s to develop a revolutionary line of computer products, including new software models which would simplify software development by exploiting modern powerful hardware. The new systems were intended to replace the System/370 in the market some time in the late 1970s.

There were two key components to FS. The first was the use of a single-level store that allows data stored on secondary storage like disk drives to be referred to within a program as if it was data stored in main memory; variables in the code could point to objects in storage and they would invisibly be loaded into memory, eliminating the need to write code for file handling. The second was to include instructions corresponding to the statements in high-level programming languages, allowing the system to directly run programs without the need for a compiler to convert from the language to machine code. One could, for instance, write a program in a text editor and the machine would be able to run that directly.

Combining the two concepts in a single system in a single step proved to be an impossible task. This concern was pointed out from the start by the engineers, but it was ignored by management and project leaders for many reasons. Officially started in the fall of 1971, by 1974 the project was moribund, and formally cancelled in February 1975. The single-level store was implemented in the System/38 and moved to other systems in the lineup after that, but the concept of a machine that directly ran high-level languages has never appeared in an IBM product.

== History ==
===370===
The System/360 was announced in April 1964. Only six months later, IBM began a study project on what trends were taking place in the market and how these should be used in a series of machines that would replace the 360 in the future. One significant change was the introduction of useful integrated circuits (ICs), which would allow the many individual components of the 360 to be replaced with a smaller number of ICs. This would allow a more powerful machine to be built for the same price as existing models.

By the mid-1960s, the 360 had become a massive best-seller. This influenced the design of the new machines, as it led to demands that the machines have complete backward compatibility with the 360 series. When the machines were announced in 1970, now known as the System/370, they were essentially 360s using small-scale ICs for logic, much larger amounts of internal memory and other relatively minor changes. A few new instructions were added and others cleaned up, but the system was largely identical from the programmer&#x27;s point of view.

The recession of 1969–1970 led to slowing sales in the 1970-71 time period and much smaller orders for the 370 compared to the rapid uptake of the 360 five years earlier. For the first time in decades, IBM&#x27;s growth stalled. While some in the company began efforts to introduce useful improvements to the 370 as soon as possible to make them more attractive, others felt nothing short of a complete reimagining of the system would work in the long term.

===Replacing the 370===
Two months before the announcement of the 370s, the company once again started considering changes in the market and how that would influence future designs. In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that integrated circuits would see exponential growth in the number of circuits they supported, today known as Moore&#x27;s Law. IBM&#x27;s Jerrier A. Haddad wrote a memo on the topic, suggesting that the cost of logic and memory was going to zero faster than it could be measured.

An internal Corporate Technology Committee (CTC) study concluded a 30-fold reduction in the price of memory would take place in the next five years, and another 30 in the five after that. If IBM was going to maintain its sales figures, it was going to have to sell 30 times as much memory in five years, and 900 times as much five years later. Similarly, hard disk cost was expected to fall ten times in the next ten years. To maintain their traditional 15% year-over-year growth, by 1980 they would have to be selling 40 times as much disk space and 3600 times as much memory.

In terms of the computer itself, if one followed the progression from the 360 to the 370 and onto some hypothetical System/380, the new machines would be based on large-scale integration and would be dramatically reduced in complexity and cost. There was no way they could sell such a machine at their current pricing, if they tried, another company would introduce far less expensive systems. They could instead produce much more powerful machines at the same price points, but their customers were already underutilizing their existing systems. To provide a reasonable argument to buy a new high-end machine, IBM had to come up with reasons for their customers to need this extra power.

Another strategic issue was that while the cost of computing was steadily going down, the costs of programming and operations, being made of personnel costs, were steadily going up. Therefore, the part of the customer&#x27;s IT budget available for hardware vendors would be significantly reduced in the coming years, and with it the base for IBM revenue. It was imperative that IBM, by addressing the cost of application development and operations in its future products, would at the same time reduce the total cost of IT to the customers and capture a larger portion of that cost.

===AFS===
In 1969, Bob O. Evans, president of the IBM System Development Division which developed their largest mainframes, asked Erich Bloch of the IBM Poughkeepsie Lab to consider how the company might use these much cheaper components to build machines that would still retain the company&#x27;s profits. Bloch, in turn, asked Carl Conti to outline such systems. Having seen the term &quot;future systems&quot; being used, Evans referred to the group as Advanced Future Systems. The group met roughly biweekly.

Among the many developments initially studied under AFS, one concept stood out. At the time, the first systems with virtual memory (VM) were emerging, and the seminal Multics project had expanded on this concept as the basis for a single-level store. In this concept, all data in the system is treated as if it is in main memory, and if the data is physically located on secondary storage, the VM system automatically loads it into memory when a program calls for it. Instead of writing code to read and write data in files, the programmer simply told the operating system they would be using certain data, which then appeared as objects in the program&#x27;s memory and could be manipulated like any other variable. The VM system would ensure that the data was synchronized with storage when needed.

This was seen as a particularly useful concept at the time, as the emergence of bubble memory suggested that future systems would not have separate core memory and disk drives, instead everything would be stored in a large amount of bubble memory. Physically, systems would be single-level stores, so the idea of having another layer for &quot;files&quot; which represented separate storage made no sense, and having pointers into a single large memory would not only mean one could simply refer to any data as it if were local, but also eliminate the need for separate application programming interfaces (APIs) for the same data depending on whether it was loaded or not.

===HLS===
Evans also asked John McPherson at IBM&#x27;s Armonk headquarters to chair another group to consider how IBM would offer these new designs across their many divisions. A group of twelve participants spread across three divisions produced the &quot;Higher Level System Report&quot;, or HLS, which was delivered on 25 February 1970. A key component of HLS was the idea that programming was more expensive than hardware. If a system could greatly reduce the cost of development, then that system could be sold for more money, as the overall cost of operation would still be lower than the competition.

The basic concept of the System/360 series was that a single instruction set architecture (ISA) would be defined that offered every possible instruction the assembly language programmer might desire. Whereas previous systems might be dedicated to scientific programming or currency calculations and had instructions for that sort of data, the 360 offered instructions for both of these and practically every other task. Individual machines were then designed that targeted particular workloads and ran those instructions directly in hardware and implemented the others in microcode. This meant any machine in the 360 family could run programs from any other, just faster or slower depending on the task. This proved enormously successful, as a customer could buy a low-end machine and always upgrade to a faster one in the future, knowing all their applications would continue to run.

Although the 360&#x27;s instruction set was large, those instructions were still low-level, representing single operations that the central processing unit (CPU) would perform, like &quot;add two numbers&quot; or &quot;compare this number to zero&quot;. Programming languages and their links to the operating system allowed users to type in programs using high-level concepts like &quot;open file&quot; or &quot;add these arrays&quot;. The compilers would convert these higher-level abstractions into a series of machine code instructions.

For HLS, the instructions would instead represent those higher-level tasks directly. That is, there would be instructions in the machine code for &quot;open file&quot;. If a program called this instruction, there was no need to convert this into lower-level code, the machine would do this internally in microcode or even a direct hardware implementation. This worked hand-in-hand with the single-level store; to implement HLS, every bit of data in the system was paired with a &quot;descriptor&quot;, a record that contained the type of the data, its location in memory, and its precision and size. As descriptors could point to arrays and record structures as well, this allowed the machine language to process these as atomic objects.

By representing these much higher-level objects directly in the system, user programs would be much smaller and simpler. For instance, to add two arrays of numbers held in files in traditional languages, one would generally open the two files, read one item from each, add them, and then store the value to a third file. In the HLS approach, one would simply open the files and call add. The underlying operating system would map these into memory, create descriptors showing them both to be arrays and then the add instruction would see they were arrays and add all the values together. Assigning that value into a newly created array would have the effect of writing it back to storage. A program that might take a page or so of code was now reduced to a few lines. Moreover, as this was the natural language of the machine, the command shell was itself programmable in the same way, there would be no need to &quot;write a program&quot; for a simple task like this, it could be entered as a command.

The report concluded:

===Compatible concerns===
Until the end of the 1960s, IBM had been making most of its profit on hardware, bundling support software and services along with its systems to make them more attractive. Only hardware carried a price tag, but those prices included an allocation for software and services.

Other manufacturers had started to market compatible hardware, mainly peripherals such as tape and disk drives, at a price significantly lower than IBM, thus shrinking the possible base for recovering the cost of software and services. IBM responded by refusing to service machines with these third-party add-ons, which led almost immediately to sweeping anti-trust investigations and many subsequent legal remedies. In 1969, the company was forced to end its bundling arrangements and announced they would sell software products separately.

Gene Amdahl saw an opportunity to sell compatible machines without software; the customer could purchase a machine from Amdahl and the operating system and other software from IBM. If IBM refused to sell it to them, they would be breaching their legal obligations. In early 1970, Amdahl quit IBM and announced his intention to introduce System/370 compatible machines that would be faster than IBM&#x27;s high-end offerings but cost less to purchase and operate.

At first, IBM was unconcerned. They made most of their money on software and support, and that money would still be going to them. But to be sure, in early 1971 an internal IBM task force, Project Counterpoint, was formed to study the concept. They concluded that the compatible mainframe business was indeed viable and that the basis for charging for software and services as part of the hardware price would quickly vanish. These events created a desire within the company to find some solution that would once again force the customers to purchase everything from IBM but in a way that would not violate antitrust laws.

If IBM followed the suggestions of the HLS report, this would mean that other vendors would have to copy the microcode implementing the huge number of instructions. As this was software, if they did, those companies would be subject to copyright violations. At this point, the AFS/HLS concepts gained new currency within the company.

===Future Systems===
In May–June 1971, an international task force convened in Armonk under John Opel, then a vice-president of IBM. Its assignment was to investigate the feasibility of a new line of computers which would take advantage of IBM&#x27;s technological advantages in order to render obsolete all previous computers - compatible offerings but also IBM&#x27;s own products. The task force concluded that the project was worth pursuing, but that the key to acceptance in the marketplace was an order-of-magnitude reduction in the costs of developing, operating and maintaining application software.

The major objectives of the FS project were consequently stated as follows:
*make obsolete all existing computing equipment, including IBM&#x27;s, by fully exploiting the newest technologies,
*diminish greatly the costs and efforts involved in application development and operations,
*provide a technically sound basis for re-bundling as much as possible of IBM&#x27;s offerings (hardware, software and services)

It was hoped that a new architecture making heavier use of hardware resources, the cost of which was going down, could significantly simplify software development and reduce costs for both IBM and customers.

== Technology ==

=== Data access ===
One design principle of FS was a &quot;single-level store&quot; which extended the idea of virtual memory (VM) to cover persistent data. In traditional designs, programs allocate memory to hold values that represent data. This data would normally disappear if the machine is turned off, or the user logs out. In order to have this data available in the future, additional code is needed to write it to permanent storage like a hard drive, and then read it back in the future. To ease these common operations, a number of database engines emerged in the 1960s that allowed programs to hand data to the engine which would then save it and retrieve it again on demand.

Another emerging technology at the time was the concept of virtual memory. In early systems, the amount of memory available to a program to allocate for data was limited by the amount of main memory in the system, which might vary based on such factors as it is moved from one machine to another, or if other programs were allocating memory of their own. Virtual memory systems addressed this problem by defining a maximum amount of memory available to all programs, typically some very large number, much more than the physical memory in the machine. In the case that a program asks to allocate memory that is not physically available, a block of main memory is written out to disk, and that space is used for the new allocation. If the program requests data from that offloaded (&quot;paged&quot; or &quot;spooled&quot;) memory area, it is invisibly loaded back into main memory again.

A single-level store is essentially an expansion of virtual memory to all memory, internal or external. VM systems invisibly write memory to a disk, which is the same task as the file system, so there is no reason it cannot be used as the file system. Instead of programs allocating memory from &quot;main memory&quot; which is then perhaps sent to some other backing store by VM, &quot;all&quot; memory is immediately allocated by the VM. This means there is no need to save and load data, simply allocating it in memory will have that effect as the VM system writes it out. When the user logs back in, that data, and the programs that were running it as they are also in the same unified memory, are immediately available in the same state they were before. The entire concept of loading and saving is removed, programs, and entire systems, pick up where they were even after a machine restart.

This concept had been explored in the Multics system but proved to be very slow, but that was a side-effect of available hardware where the main memory was implemented in core with a far slower backing store in the form of a hard drive or drum. With the introduction of new forms of non-volatile memory, most notably bubble memory, that worked at speeds similar to core but had memory density similar to a hard disk, it appeared a single-level store would no longer have any performance downside.

Future Systems planned on making the single-level store the key concept in its new operating systems. Instead of having a separate database engine that programmers would call, there would simply be calls in the system&#x27;s application programming interface (API) to retrieve memory. And those API calls would be based on particular hardware or microcode implementations, which would only be available on IBM systems, thereby achieving IBM&#x27;s goal of tightly tying the hardware to the programs that ran on it.

=== Processor ===
Another principle was the use of very high-level complex instructions to be implemented in microcode. As an example, one of the instructions, codice_1, was a complete linkage editor. Other instructions were designed to support the internal data structures and operations of programming languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and PL/I. In effect, FS was designed to be the ultimate complex instruction set computer (CISC).

Another way of presenting the same concept was that the entire collection of functions previously implemented as hardware, operating system software, data base software and more would now be considered as making up one integrated system, with each and every elementary function implemented in one of many layers including circuitry, microcode, and conventional software. More than one layer of microcode and code were contemplated, sometimes referred to as picocode or millicode. 
Depending on the people one was talking to, the very notion of a &quot;machine&quot; therefore ranged between those functions which were implemented as circuitry (for the hardware specialists) to the complete set of functions offered to users, irrespective of their implementation (for the systems architects).

The overall design also called for a &quot;universal controller&quot; to handle primarily input-output operations outside of the main processor. That universal controller would have a very limited instruction set, restricted to those operations required for I/O, pioneering the concept of a reduced instruction set computer (RISC).

Meanwhile, John Cocke, one of the chief designers of early IBM computers, began a research project to design the first reduced instruction set computer (RISC). In the long run, the IBM 801 RISC architecture, which eventually evolved into IBM&#x27;s POWER, PowerPC, and Power architectures, proved to be vastly cheaper to implement and capable of achieving much higher clock rate.

== Development ==

=== Project start ===
The FS project was officially started in September 1971, following the recommendations of a special task force assembled in the second quarter of 1971. In the course of time, several other research projects in various IBM locations merged into the FS project or became associated with it.

=== Project management ===
During its entire life, the FS project was conducted under tight security provisions. The project was broken down into many subprojects assigned to different teams. The documentation was similarly broken down into many pieces, and access to each document was subject to verification of the need-to-know by the project office. Documents were tracked and could be called back at any time.

In Sowa&#x27;s memo (see External Links, below) he noted &quot;The avowed aim of all this red tape is to prevent anyone from understanding the whole system; this goal has certainly been achieved.&quot;

As a consequence, most people working on the project had an extremely limited view of it, restricted to what they needed to know in order to produce their expected contribution. Some teams were even working on FS without knowing. This explains why, when asked to define FS, most people give a very partial answer, limited to the intersection of FS with their field of competence.

=== Planned product lines ===
Three implementations of the FS architecture were planned: the top-of-line model was being designed in Poughkeepsie, NY, where IBM&#x27;s largest and fastest computers were built; the next model down was being designed in Endicott, NY, which had responsibility for the mid-range computers; the model below that was being designed in Böblingen, Germany, and the smallest model was being designed in Hursley, UK.

A continuous range of performance could be offered by varying the number of processors in a system at each of the four implementation levels.

Early 1973, overall project management and the teams responsible for the more &quot;outside&quot; layers common to all implementations were consolidated in the Mohansic ASDD laboratory (halfway between the Armonk/White Plains headquarters and Poughkeepsie).

=== Project end ===
The FS project was terminated in 1975. The reasons given for terminating the project depend on the person asked, each of whom puts forward the issues related to the domain with which they were familiar. In reality, the success of the project was dependent on a large number of breakthroughs in all areas from circuit design and manufacturing to marketing and maintenance. Although each single issue, taken in isolation, might have been resolved, the probability that they could all be resolved in time and in mutually compatible ways was practically zero.

One symptom was the poor performance of its largest implementation, but the project was also marred by protracted internal arguments about various technical aspects, including internal IBM debates about the merits of RISC vs. CISC designs. The complexity of the instruction set was another obstacle; it was considered &quot;incomprehensible&quot; by IBM&#x27;s own engineers and there were strong indications that the system wide single-level store could not be backed up in part, foretelling the IBM AS/400&#x27;s partitioning of the System/38&#x27;s single-level store. Moreover, simulations showed that the execution of native FS instructions on the high-end machine was slower than the System/370 emulator on the same machine.

The FS project was finally terminated when IBM realized that customer acceptance would be much more limited than originally predicted because there was no reasonable application migration path for 360 architecture customers. In order to leave maximum freedom to design a truly revolutionary system, ease of application migration was not one of the primary design goals for the FS project, but was to be addressed by software migration aids taking the new architecture as a given. In the end, it appeared that the cost of migrating the mass of user investments in COBOL and assembly language based applications to FS was in many cases likely to be greater than the cost of acquiring a new system.

== Results ==
Although the FS project as a whole was terminated, a simplified version of the architecture for the smallest of the three machines continued to be developed in Rochester. It was finally released as the IBM System/38, which proved to be a good design for ease of programming, but it was woefully underpowered. The AS/400 inherited the same architecture, but with performance improvements. In both machines, the high-level instruction set generated by compilers is not interpreted, but translated into a lower-level machine instruction set and executed; the original lower-level instruction set was a CISC instruction set with some similarities to the System/360 instruction set. In later machines the lower-level instruction set was an extended version of the PowerPC instruction set, which evolved from John Cocke&#x27;s RISC machine. The dedicated hardware platform was replaced in 2008 by the IBM Power Systems platform running the IBM i operating system.

Besides System/38 and the AS/400, which inherited much of the FS architecture, bits and pieces of Future Systems technology were incorporated in the following parts of IBM&#x27;s product line:

* the IBM 3081 mainframe computer, which was essentially the top-of-the line machine designed in Poughkeepsie, using the System/370 emulator microcode, and with the FS microcode removed and used
* the 3800 laser printer, and some machines that would lead to the IBM 3279 terminal and GDDM
* the IBM 3850 automatic magnetic tape library
* the IBM 8100 mid-range computer, which was based on a CPU called the &quot;Universal Controller&quot;, which had been intended for FS input/output processing
* network enhancements concerning VTAM and NCP

<text>HMS &quot;Gurkha&quot; was a destroyer that saw active service in the Norway Campaign in 1940, where she was sunk.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Ghurka&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

== Construction and career ==
Authorized as one of seven Tribal-class destroyers under the 1935 Naval Estimates, &quot;Gurkha&quot; (originally &quot;Ghurka&quot;) was the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 10 March 1936 from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering and was laid down on 6 July at the company&#x27;s Govan shipyard. Launched on 7 July 1937, &quot;Gurkha&quot; was commissioned on 21 October at a cost of £340,997 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty. The ship&#x27;s completion was delayed by the late delivery of her gunsights.

On commissioning, &quot;Gurkha&quot; joined the First Tribal Destroyer Flotilla (which was renamed the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939) as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was involved in exercises and port visits until the outbreak of war, suffering minor damage in a collision with sister-ship . In September 1939, &quot;Gurkha&quot; was one of a group of ships assigned to monitor Italian naval activity in the Red Sea. In October 1939 the flotilla was reassigned to the Home Fleet, on escort duty from Portland. &quot;Gurkha&quot;, like many of the Tribals, suffered from mechanical defects including problems with the ship&#x27;s turbines and leaks in the reserve feed tanks, and underwent repair at Thornycroft&#x27;s Southampton shipyard from December 1939 to January 1940, before rejoining her Flotilla, now based at Scapa Flow.

On the night of 23/24 February 1940, &quot;Gurkha&quot; spotted the German submarine on the surface between the Faroe Islands and Orkney Islands. She attacked and sank the enemy south of the Faroe Islands on 23 February 1940. &quot;U-53&quot; dived to avoid a ramming attempt by &quot;Gurkha&quot;. &quot;Gurkha&quot; responded with a series of depth charge attacks, sinking &quot;U-53&quot; with the loss of all hands.
On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Norway, and &quot;Gurkha&quot; was part of a naval force (consisting of the cruisers , , , and , together with the destroyers , &quot;Gurkha&quot;, &quot;Sikh&quot;, , , and ) detached from the Home Fleet to attack Bergen, where a German cruiser was reported. The attack was cancelled by the British Admiralty, however, and the British force was attacked by 47 German Ju 88 and 41 He 111 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 30 and Kampfgeschwader 26. In an attempt to obtain better firing conditions, &quot;Gurkha&quot; moved away from the mutual protection of the naval force. She then became an easy target for concentrated air attack and soon was stopped by a single bomb hit. The crew were rescued by the cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Mashona&quot;, with &quot;Gurkha&quot; sinking with the loss of 16 of her crew.

<text>The SPAD S.VII C.1 was the first in a series of single-seat biplane fighter aircraft produced by &quot;Société Pour L&#x27;Aviation et ses Dérivés&quot; (SPAD) during the First World War. Like its successors, the S.VII was renowned as a sturdy and rugged aircraft with good diving characteristics. It was also a stable gun platform, although pilots used to the more manoeuvrable Nieuport fighters found it heavy on the controls. It was flown by a number of famous aces, such as France&#x27;s Georges Guynemer, Italy&#x27;s Francesco Baracca and Australia&#x27;s Alexander Pentland.

==Design and development==

===Origins===
In February 1915, Swiss designer Marc Birkigt had created an overhead cam aviation powerplant based on his Hispano-Suiza V8 automobile engine, resulting in a engine capable of producing at 1,400 rpm. Further refinement brought the power to by July 1915. Given the engine&#x27;s potential, French officials ordered called upon aircraft designers to create a new high-performance fighter around the engine, called the Hispano-Suiza 8A, with production to begin as soon as possible.

Louis Béchereau, chief designer of the SPAD company, quickly produced a prototype fighter with the new engine. The SPAD V was a version of the SPAD S.A two-seat &quot;pulpit fighter&quot;, which dispensed with the so-called &quot;pulpit&quot; which carried the observer in front of the propeller.

===Design===
One of many many common design features between the new SPAD V and the S.A.2 was the use of a single-bay biplane wing with additional struts mounted mid-bay at the point of junction of the flying and landing wires. This design simplified rigging and reduced drag. The fuselage was of the standard construction for the time, consisting of a wooden frame covered with fabric, while the forward part was covered with metal sheeting. A .303 (7.7mm) Vickers machine gun was installed above the engine, synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The prototype was also fitted with a large spinner, to be abandoned later. Another common design feature of both the &quot;pulpit fighters&quot; and the S.VII – also shared with the S.XIII – was the pushrod aileron control linkage, which used a pair of exposed, 90° bellcranks protruding from the lower wing panels to operate vertical pushrods, going up to forward-projecting aileron control horns.

SPAD test pilot Bequet flew the SPAD V for the first time in April 1916. Flight testing revealed excellent maximum speed ( and climb rate of 4.5 min to ). The airframe&#x27;s sound construction also enabled a good diving performance. In comparison, the Nieuport 17 sesquiplane fighters that equipped a large part of the fighter units couldn&#x27;t dive as fast because of their lower weight, but could outclimb the SPADs by a wide margin. The high diving speed promised to give lower-skilled Allied pilots the initiative to engage or leave combat against heavier German fighters. If the new fighter was a rugged and stable shooting platform, many pilots regretted its lack of manoeuverability.

An initial production contract was made on 10 May 1916, calling for 268 machines, to be designated SPAD VII C.1 (C.1, from &quot;avion de chasse&quot; in French, indicating the aircraft was a fighter, while the 1 indicated it was a single seater).

Early production aircraft suffered from numerous defects which took time to resolve and limited deliveries. While a few SPADs arrived at frontline units as early as August 1916, large numbers only began to appear in the first months of 1917. In hot weather, the engine overheated and in cold weather, the engine would not warm up. Field modifications attempted to counter the problem, including cutting extra holes in the metal sheeting to provide more air over the engine. On the production lines, the cowling opening was enlarged and then redesigned with vertical shutters to solve both problems. The engine mount also proved weak, and reinforcements were added. Early production aircraft had two ammunition drums: one for the loaded canvas cartridge belt, and one to hold the empty belt after the rounds had been fired. However, dealing with the fabric belt as it came out of the gun was a significant problem, and was prone to jamming, which was only solved when Prideaux disintegrating ammo links were introduced.

With the initial teething problems solved, several subcontractors began producing the SPAD VII under license. The subcontractors included the firms Grémont, Janoir, Kellner et Fils, de Marçay, Société d&#x27;Etudes Aéronautiques, Régy and Sommer. It was not, however, until February 1917 that the last examples from the initial batch of 268 aircraft was delivered. In early 1917, an improved version of the engine developing , the Hispano-Suiza 8Ab, was made available. This provided the SPAD VII with better performance, the top speed increasing from . The new engine gradually became the standard powerplant for the SPAD VII and by April 1917, all newly produced aircraft were equipped with it.

===Variants and experiments===
Numerous experiments were made to improve performance. A Renault V8 powerplant was tested but required major redesign and the performance was not worthwhile. A supercharged Hispano-Suiza engine was also tested, but also failed to significantly improve performance. Different wing profiles were tested but were not incorporated in production models. One field modification was applied in Czechoslovakia after the war when the undercarriage struts of one S.VII were faired over.

Early in the development of the S.VII, the British RFC and RNAS showed an interest in the new fighter. An initial order for 30 aircraft was made but production difficulties kept the delivery rate very low, with production not even meeting French requirements. As the RFC was encountering stronger opposition over the Front, production of the S.VII was initiated in the United Kingdom. Blériot &amp; SPAD Aircraft Works and Mann, Egerton &amp; Co. Ltd. were supplied with plans and sample aircraft and to begin production as soon as possible.

The first British-built S.VII was flown and tested in April 1917, and the first aircraft was reported to have performance equal to that of French models. There were however differences between the two. The British were worried about the light armament of the S.VII as most German fighters were now carrying two guns and experiments were made with an extra machine gun on the S.VII. One aircraft was fitted with a Lewis machine gun on the top wing and tested at Martlesham Heath in May 1917, while front line units also made field modifications with Foster mounts commonly associated with the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. The performance penalty was too drastic for the installation to become standard, and most S.VIIs flew with a single Vickers.

Other distinguishing features of the British-built S.VIIs included a gun fairing and a solid cowling access panel. The gun fairing partially covered the gun and extended rearwards, replacing the windshield. This, however, seriously limited pilot vision to the front and, although retained on training aircraft, was removed on aircraft destined for front line units. The bulged engine access panel located under the exhaust pipe on British models was made of a solid sheet of metal, in place of the louvered panel fitted on French production models. Some British SPADs were also fitted with small spinners on the prop hub.

It was soon apparent that British production lines had lower quality standards than their French counterparts, degrading performance and handling. Poor fabric sewing, fragile tailskids and ineffective radiators plagued the British SPADs. Photographic evidence shows that some had the cylinder bank fairings, or even the entire upper engine cowling, cut out to compensate for the malfunctioning radiators. As a result, most British-built S.VIIs were used for training, with front line units equipped with French-built models. After some 220 had been produced, British production of the S.VII was halted in favour of comparable British types that were becoming available.

In a similar fashion, the Dux factory in Moscow produced approximately 100 S.VIIs under licence in 1917, with engines supplied by France. It would appear the engines were often used and/or of lower quality, and that Dux used lower-grade material in building the airframes. This combination of extra weight and weaker powerplants significantly reduced performance.

The total number of aircraft produced is uncertain, with sources varying from 3,825 to some 5,600 SPAD S.VIIs built in France, 220 in the United Kingdom and approximately 100 in Russia. French production numbers may include other SPAD models, and/or S.VIIs produced by other contractors.

The SPAD XII began as an enlarged S.VII, equipped with a 37 mm cannon. It was a distinct type rather than a variant of the S.VII though. the S.VII can be distinguished from both the S.XII and the later and larger S.XIII by having unraked cabane struts, connecting the top wing to the fuselage, as well as differences in armament.

Late models were equipped with or Hispano-Suiza engines. The upgrade produced a top speed of .

==Operational history==

===France===

The French &quot;Aviation Militaire&quot; had been sufficiently impressed by the performance of the SPAD V prototype to order a batch of 268 aircraft on 10 May 1916. However, teething problems soon appeared and it would be several months before the SPAD VII would serve in significant numbers on the front, the last aircraft of the initial batch only being delivered in February 1917.

In spite of these delays, some aircraft were delivered to frontline units as early as August 1916, complementing the Nieuport fighters. By this date, the Nieuport 11 that had ended the infamous &quot;Fokker scourge&quot; episode had been largely replaced by later types such as the Nieuport 17, but these were now being bested by a new generation of German fighters by the second half of 1916 that threatened to give Germany mastery of the skies again. At the same time, the rotary engines that had powered most Allied fighters until then were proving difficult to scale further, while the heavier inline engines were steadily getting more powerful. In this context, it was hoped the new Hispano-Suiza 8-powered SPAD VII would be able to fight the latest German fighters on better terms. The first aircraft delivered to a frontline unit was S.112 flown by Lt Sauvage of N.65, followed by S.113, assigned to Georges Guynemer of N.3. Guynemer was already credited with 15 victories at the time, but it was Armand Pinsard of N.26 who was the first to score an aerial victory on 26 August.
The introduction of the SPAD VII was not enough to change the balance of the air war, but it allowed both pilots and mechanics to familiarise themselves with the new fighter. Many pilots found the SPAD lacked manoeuverability, and some even returned to the nimbler Nieuports. New tactics based on speed were developed to take advantage of the SPAD&#x27;s power, and to compensate for its lack of manoeuvrability. The aircraft&#x27;s capacity to dive safely up to permitted the pilot to disengage from combat when the situation demanded it.

With early problems solved and production shared between several manufacturers, the SPAD VII was finally available in large numbers at the front in early 1917. By mid-1917, some 500 were in front-line service, having largely replaced the Nieuport. It gained a reputation for being stronger than its predecessors. Its principal shortcoming was its one machine gun armament at a time when the opposing Albatros D.III fighters were equipped with two. The SPAD VII was gradually replaced by the improved SPAD XIII in frontline units, but remained in use as a trainer aircraft with Aviation Militaire throughout the war, and it remained as the standard pilot certification test aircraft until 1928.

===Foreign service===

Allied air services were also equipped with the new fighter. The Royal Flying Corps was the first foreign service to receive the SPAD VII, although only 19 Squadron and 23 Squadron) used it on the Western Front. Fighter schools in the United Kingdom and 30 Squadron in Mesopotamia also received SPADs. British-built SPADs were generally used in the training units and in the Middle East, while fighting units in France used superior French-built models. The SPAD VII was replaced by the Sopwith Dolphin in 19 Squadron in January 1918 – with No. 23 Squadron in April (becoming perhaps the last squadron to use S.VIIs in France).

Russia received a batch of 43 in spring 1917 which were supplemented by approximately 100 SPAD VII manufactured by the Dux factory under licence.

Another early user of the SPAD VII was Germany. Several were captured intact and were reportedly used both in combat and for training. Rudolf Windisch of Jasta 66 flew a SPAD VII with German markings in combat, although it is not known if any aerial victories were achieved.

Belgium equipped the &quot;5e Escadrille&quot; (later renamed &quot;10e Escadrille&quot;) with the S.VII. Edmond Thieffry was probably the most famous Belgian pilot to fly the type, most other aces preferring the Hanriot HD.1.

Italy began using the SPAD VII in March 1917 where nine &quot;Squadriglia&quot; were equipped with it. As was the case in other air services, pilots accustomed to more manoeuverable mounts disliked the new fighter, and again some reverted to the Nieuport 27 or the Hanriot HD.1, which eventually became the standard Italian fighter. Francesco Baracca, Italy&#x27;s leading ace, was delighted with the new model, and his personal aircraft is preserved in Italy.

When the United States entered the war in 1917, an order for 189 SPAD VIIs was placed for the United States Army Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force. The first aircraft were delivered in December 1917. Most were used as advanced trainers to prepare the American pilots for the SPAD XIII.

After the war, surplus SPAD VIIs were used into the late 1920s by numerous countries, including Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Siam, the United States and Yugoslavia.

<text>Stars Forever is the thirteenth studio album by Scottish musician Momus, released by Le Grand Magistery in 1999. The album represents part of Momus&#x27;s &quot;analog-baroque&quot; phase.

Momus wrote thirty songs for &quot;Stars Forever&quot;, each about a person or group who commissioned a song for the price of $1,000. The funds raised went towards costs incurred from a lawsuit against Momus by Wendy Carlos. Patrons included fellow musicians The Minus 5, Keigo Oyamada, artist Jeff Koons, retail store Other Music, and record label Minty Fresh. 

The album also features eight winners of a karaoke parody contest in which participants were invited to submit recordings of themselves singing over instrumentals included on Momus&#x27; previous album, &quot;The Little Red Songbook&quot; (1998).

<text>Michael Sundin (1 March 1961 – 23 July 1989) was an English television presenter, actor, dancer and trampolinist. He was a presenter of the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; for 77 episodes between 1984 and 1985.

==Early life and career==
Michael Sundin was born in Low Fell, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. His parents were Alan and Joyce Sundin, and he had a brother named David.

After winning five British titles and one world title in British &amp; World Trampolining tournaments, he entered show business in 1980 when he appeared in the pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, with Barbara Windsor. Sundin made various television and theatre appearances, both as an actor and dancer, which led to a long run in the Cameron Mackintosh-produced musical &quot;Cats&quot;, in which he played Bill Bailey in its West End run from 1982 until 1983. He also appeared in the video for Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&quot; from 1982.

In 1984, he began rehearsing the character Tik-Tok for the Walt Disney film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, and this was covered by the long-running BBC children&#x27;s magazine programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. Sundin impressed the editor, Biddy Baxter, and was invited to audition for the presenting vacancy left by Peter Duncan; one of the audition items was to interview someone on a trampoline, and he presented his first programme on 13 September 1984.

After fronting 77 episodes, the editors and production team for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; decided not to renew Sundin&#x27;s contract following the summer break, because they felt that he had little rapport with the viewers and it was claimed by the editor that some parents and children complained about his effeminacy. However, coverage in the press of him as a gay man was also rumoured to have been a factor. He presented his last show on 24 June 1985. Sundin was very unhappy about this decision, and made his feelings known in the tabloid press. Four months later, a response occurred through the printing of photographs of Sundin dancing with a male stripper in London.

In 2007 the former editor of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Biddy Baxter was interviewed by journalist Mark Lawson, transmitted as part of BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s TV on Trial&quot; week of programmes. For the first time on television, Baxter was confronted about the departure of Sundin. In the interview Baxter blamed the press for the inaccurate coverage of Sundin&#x27;s sacking from the programme because of his sexuality. In previous documentaries and programmes Baxter had avoided addressing such questions about Sundin&#x27;s involvement in the programme. In the interview she denied that he had been sacked due to his sexuality and said that &quot;It was his leaving the programme because children didn&#x27;t like him – nothing to do with his sexual proclivities&quot;.

Sundin subsequently appeared in the film &quot;Lionheart&quot; (1987) in which he was incorrectly credited as &#x27;Michel Sundin&#x27;. From 1987 to 1988 he was in a UK theatre tour of &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; and a Japanese/Australian tour of &quot;Starlight Express&quot;.

One of his final public appearances was as a dancer in the video for Rick Astley&#x27;s &quot;She Wants to Dance With Me&quot; (1988).

==Death==
In 1988, Sundin fell ill. At the age of 28, he died in the Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper reported (on 26 July 1989) that he had died of liver cancer. It was later reported that he died from an AIDS–related illness. He was the first former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter to die.

<text>Phoenix Raceway (formerly known as ISM Raceway from 2018–2020, Phoenix International Raceway from 1964–1973 and 1976–2017, and FasTrack International Speedway from 1973–1976) is a dogleg oval track in Avondale, Arizona. The track has held a variety of events since its opening in 1964, including NASCAR, IndyCar, and CART races. It has seating capacity of 42,000 as of 2019. Phoenix Raceway is currently owned by NASCAR and is led by track president Latasha Causey. 

Phoenix Raceway opened in 1964 under the control of Richard Hogue as a multi-layout facility. After slow expansion for nearly a decade, the facility was bought out by Phoenix businessman Malcolm Bricklin in 1973 under the General Vehicle brand. The company&#x27;s ownership was short-lived due to the company&#x27;s troubles and eventual bankruptcy due to the failure of the Bricklin SV-1, and the speedway was bought out by a group of Arizona businessmen led by Bob Fletcher in 1976. After a series of ownership changes from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the facility oversaw a period of mass expansion under the ownership of Buddy Jobe, who bought the track in 1985 and owned it until 1997, when the International Speedway Corporation (ISC) purchased the facility. Since ISC&#x27;s purchase, the facility has undergone two major reconfigurations: one in 2011 that altered the track&#x27;s dogleg, and one in 2018 that changed the location of the start-finish line. 

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
Phoenix Raceway in its current form is measured at , with 9° of banking in the first two turns, 11° of banking in the last two turns, 9° of banking on the frontstretch, and 3° of banking on the backstretch according to Jayski. The track is known for its backstretch kink, commonly referred to as a &quot;dogleg&quot; that was added to accommodate the track&#x27;s original road course that used parts of the oval alongside specialized portions outside the oval. 

When the facility first opened, multiple layouts were included. Alongside the oval track&#x27;s opening in 1964, a road course layout that used both parts of the oval and specialized sections and a dragstrip was included. Additionally, since 1992, a 11-turn infield road course measuring at was included in the facility&#x27;s layouts. 

=== Amenities ===
Phoenix Raceway is located in Avondale, Arizona, and is served by Avondale Boulevard, which is an exit of Interstate 10. As of 2019, the facility has a capacity of 42,000 according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. The track also offers a general admission seating area on the side of a hill outside the track&#x27;s first and second turns; the section is named &quot;Rattlesnake Hill&quot; as a tribute to old stories of Phoenix Raceway officials reportedly having to remove numerous animals before races, including rattlesnakes and scorpions. 

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===

On July 10, 1963, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; Frank Gianelli reported that a group formed by businessman Richard Hogue acquired a plot of land originally used to grow cotton in Estrella Mountains. With the purchase, the group made plans to build a US$500,000 (adjusted for inflation, $) motorsports complex including a oval, a road course, and a dragstrip under the name of Phoenix International Raceway (PIR). Initially, Hogue only originally considered building the road course, but was convinced to add an oval to the facility by racing promoter J. C. Agajanian. The plan immediately faced opposition from the competing Arizona State Fairgrounds, who wished to pave their track in order to continue hosting United States Auto Club (USAC) races despite PIR officials wanting to collaborate with Fairgrounds officials. However, the Fairgrounds&#x27; paving plan was vetoed unanimously by the Arizona Fair Commission on August 26. On the same day, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors passed a permit to begin PIR construction, in the process effectively causing the Fair&#x27;s shutdown. 

Groundbreaking took place on September 19, with Hogue stating at a groundbreaking interview that &quot;we&#x27;ll be racing by late November or early December&quot;. In November, Hogue announced the first events for the track, with Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and NASCAR Grand National Series events being announced for December and January 1964, respectively. However, the track&#x27;s opening was pushed back to January 4 due to construction delays. By the end of the year, with paving complete, the facility was approved for SCCA, USAC, and National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) events. At the end of the facility&#x27;s construction, the entire complex cost approximately US$1 million (adjusted for inflation, $) to build.

=== Hogue years ===

PIR opened as scheduled, running informal SCCA events in January 1964. A month later, the first formal events at the facility were held, with Jack Hinkle winning the first highlight race at PIR&#x27;s road course. PIR received mixed initial reception; although its amenities were praised, some spectators complained about a hidden 50-cent (adjusted for inflation, $) grandstand fee alongside visibility problems caused by light poles. PIR&#x27;s drag strip held its first events on March 1. The oval held its first race 21 days later, with A. J. Foyt winning a USAC event. In April, alongside obtaining a sanction from the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), PIR ran its first FIA-sanctioned event, with Dave MacDonald winning a event.

Initially, PIR struggled with attendance, causing the facility to cancel international events in 1964 due to cost issues. In July, Harry Redkey and Bob Huff, racing promoters of the Manzanita Speedway and Tucson Speedway, respectively, took over operational duties of PIR, with Huff stating hopes of implementing &quot;a series of major improvements&quot; and a seating expansion to 13,500 to the facility. By November, renovations to the facility&#x27;s grandstand and walls were made. However, the facility still faced heavy traffic issues in Bobby Ball Memorial event that took place in the same month, partially causing the cancellation of a USAC stock car race in early 1965. Traffic improvements to PIR were completed in March 1965 alongside the widening of the track&#x27;s surface in the turns. In June, a US$10,000 renovation to PIR&#x27;s dragstrip that aimed to install increased lighting started. By the end of 1965, Hogue stated in a response to a PIR critic in a letter to the editor that PIR invested over US$100,000 in renovations, including a refurbished main grandstand and the addition of 2,000 seats. 

PIR experienced numerous crashes resulting in serious injury or death in its early years. In its first ever dragstrip event on March 1, PIR experienced its first fatality when drag racer Robert Snyders crashed during a qualifying run on the drag strip. In early December, Bobby Marshman succumbed to second and third-degree burns suffered during a tire testing crash on November 27. In August 1965, the dragstrip oversaw its second fatality when 17-year-old Phil Miner lost control of his car and crashed at approximately . In February 1967, 13-year-old Maurice Gallegos suffered major head injuries after hitting a truck during a go-kart race; Gallegos survived the incident and later sued PIR for US$1,687,624 (adjusted for inflation, $) for &quot;inadequate and ineffectual protection&quot; and a lack of &quot;prompt and adequate assistance after the accident&quot;. On February 27, 1972, United States Air Force captain Bruce Helfert died in a sports car crash on the facility&#x27;s road course.

==== Nancy Hogue era ====
Sometime between 1965 and 1967, Richard Hogue and his wife, Nancy, divorced. By February 3, 1967, Nancy was described in &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; as the sole owner of PIR. On the 15th, racing promoter J. C. Agajanian took over Redkey and Huff as the promotional director of PIR. Two days later, Nancy filed an injunction order against Redkey and Huff for &quot;fail[ing] to return... the corporate&#x27;s properties, papers and records.&quot; She also revealed that she fired the duo as they spent &quot;extravagant amounts of money for travel, hotels, entertainment, telephone calls, salaries, etc.&quot; In response, the duo sued Hogue for US$200,000 (adjusted for inflation, $) on March 2 for multiple claims, including a breach of contract, claims of Nancy deceiving the duo, and Nancy refusing to give any stock to the duo despite an agreement.

By October 1967, the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; claimed that grandstand seating had expanded to 25,000. On January 23, 1968, PIR held its first major stock car events, with Don White winning a USAC event. In March, Agajanian confirmed discussions about removing PIR&#x27;s backstretch dogleg from its oval track, stating that the corner was &quot;dangerous as hell&quot;. Three months later, the decision was confirmed by Jerry Raskin, PIR&#x27;s public relations official, with the backstretch becoming a straight line. Reportedly, the reconfiguration was complete by September; however, the claim that the dogleg was ever removed has been disputed by racing historian Kevin Triplett, who did not find any evidence that the reconfiguration ever happened. In October 1969, construction of a two-year, US$100,000 renovation project focusing on additional seating and track adjustments was completed. A year later, Phoenix hotel businessman Charlie Alexander signed a three-year lease from Nancy to become the racing director of PIR. In 1972, in response to criticism from the previous year of a dangerous and slippery track surface, track officials started putting down a traction compound to combat the issue; the fix was received well from driver Bobby Unser.

=== Short-lived FasTrack rebrand ===
On December 6, 1972, the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; reported that Nancy Hogue sold PIR to Newport Beach, California, businessman Paul O&#x27;Shea. However, nine days later, the &quot;Republic&quot; retracted their claim, stating that the facility was instead bought by the Malcolm Bricklin-owned General Vehicle Inc., with O&#x27;Shea assisting with the company&#x27;s purchase; it was also announced that Alexander was ousted from his lease on the facility. In a press conference held on January 23, 1973, newly appointed track president Anthony Kopp announced the track&#x27;s rebranding to &quot;FasTrack International Speedway&quot; as part of Bricklin&#x27;s FasTrack brand, a subsidiary under General Vehicle. Kopp also announced plans for US$30,000 worth of renovations, including the expansion of permanent seating capacity to 16,000, the construction of a new pit road, and other miscellaneous amenity improvements. Two.months later, the facility experienced its fifth fatality when driver Bob Criss died in a practice crash for a USAC event.

==== General Vehicle and Bricklin SV-1 troubles ====
Soon after General Vehicle&#x27;s purchase, the company faced a series of heavy financial issues related to the production of the Bricklin SV-1 vehicle that affected the financial situation of the facility. In June 1973, Bricklin was able to secure a CA$2.88 million loan alongside the purchase of a 51% share in Bricklin Canada from the government of New Brunswick to build a CA$9 million plant in Saint John to spur production of &quot;the Bricklin&quot;, which was advertised by Bricklin as &quot;the first mass-produced safety vehicle in the world&quot;. The car&#x27;s release faced numerous delays; start of production was delayed to January 1974 from its original start of December 1973 due to &quot;slow delivery&quot; on parts and building equipment. The car&#x27;s official reveal was further delayed from April to late June; by this point, criticism from members of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick was building on the company for a lack of transparency alongside concerns over the company&#x27;s finances. Despite concerns, the New Brunswick government increased its investment to CA$5 million by August. 

Soon after the first Bricklin SV-1 was produced on August 6, two Bricklin Canada plant managers resigned, dealing a major setback to the company. In November, Bricklin stated in an interview that the company was pleading to the New Brunswick government for an additional CA$6–8 million, with the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; indicating that the company was in heavy financial trouble due to a lack of production and sales. On December 2, New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield announced the province&#x27;s investment increased to a total CA$7.5 million alongside acquiring 67% of Bricklin Canada; the increased investment led to further skepticism from the New Brunswick opposition on the project&#x27;s viability, which had been facing increasing production costs. On the 26th, Bricklin was ordered by a Philadelphia federal court to pay US$2.3 million in a breach of contract lawsuit filed by a former employee of Bricklin, leading to further concerns over viability. On January 29, 1975, another CA$7.5 million loan was given by New Brunswick, with both Hatfield and Bricklin stating that the loan was the last expected assistance from the New Brunswick government.

In April, after increasing pressure from Liberal politicians for documents on Bricklin Canada&#x27;s finances, Bricklin voluntarily provided documents to the Opposition under the condition that the information be kept in confidence. Four months later, FasTrack International Speedway director Russ Kurtz stated in the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; that the facility had been on sale &quot;for a number of months&quot;; however, he also stated that he did not see the track being sold in the near future. After another investment of CA$1.2 million from the New Brunswick government despite previous statements, on September 22, Premier Hatfield stated that Bricklin Canada would not receive anymore funding until the completion of a viability review of the company. Three days later, Bricklin Canada entered into receivership, with Liberal politician John W. Turnbull stating that &quot;the company for all intents and purposes is bankrupt&quot;. General Vehicle filed for reorganization on October 1, leaving FasTrack in a state of &quot;limbo&quot;. In December, Bricklin resigned from General Vehicle, and the company and its subsidiaries was declared bankrupt by federal bankruptcy judge Edward Davis on January 12, 1976, with Bricklin in a reported US$34.6 million in debt. Davis also ruled to let FasTrack International Raceway to continue hosting races to pay off creditors.

=== Fletcher and Wood years ===
By early May 1976, numerous offers to purchase the facility were made, including an offer from an unspecified buyer for $200,000 and another $375,000 offer from a group led by Bill Moore. However, all were either withdrawn by prospective buyers or rejected by the court. After rejecting another offer of $280,000, Davis gave control of the facility to lienholders Nancy Hogue and First Pennsylvania Bank, leaving an uncertain future for the facility despite a potential offer from J. C. Agajanian. However, on August 18, the &quot;Republic&quot; reported that a group led by Bob Fletcher, Tom Taber, and Bill Hardy bought the facility at an undisclosed price; it was later revealed to be &quot;in the neighborhood of $400,000&quot; according to Taber. With the purchase, the track&#x27;s name was reverted to &quot;Phoenix International Raceway&quot;, with the group promising renovations to existing grandstands, garages, and media centers alongside a wider variety of events. In 1977, the track&#x27;s surface was repaved and completed by October of that year. The following year, the facility oversaw its sixth fatality, with driver Otis D. Hurley dying in a sports car crash during a practice session on the facility&#x27;s road course.

In 1980, under threats from the track&#x27;s owners to permanently shut down PIR due to owner disputes, PIR general manager Dennis Wood and contractor Bill Krug signed a three-year lease to run the facility. In a 1998 interview, Wood admitted he had little income at the time and had only obtained the lease because &quot;my only thought at the time was we can&#x27;t shut PIR down&quot;. A year later, Wood alongside California businessman Warner W. Hodgdon bought the facility from Fletcher within the &quot;seven-figure&quot; price range. Hodgdon&#x27;s ownership was short-lived; in January 1983, Wood bought Hodgdon&#x27;s 75% share of ownership, stating that the two had &quot;philosophical differences&quot; over how to run the facility. Wood later added Fletcher back as a partner for $1 as a sign of gratitude for Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;friendship and kindness toward me over the years&quot;. In 1985, after an IndyCar race was cancelled due to concerns of a deteriorating track surface with a new IndyCar model, track officials approved a repave of the oval track. That same year, James Haynes died during the Copper World Classic, becoming the seventh fatality at the facility. 

=== Buddy Jobe era, mass expansion ===
On August 23, 1985, Wood stated to the &quot;Republic&quot; that an agreement was reached with an unspecified buyer to purchase PIR. Two days later, the buyers were revealed to be farmer Emmett &quot;Buddy&quot; Jobe and accounting firm owner Patrick Johnson, with ownership officially transferring to the duo in September. With the purchase, the duo promised an increase in permanent seating capacity from 10,400 to &quot;between 20,000 and 25,000&quot; alongside starting negotiations to obtain a NASCAR Busch Grand National Series race. In February 1986, Jobe bought out Johnson&#x27;s share of ownership, becoming the sole owner of the facility. Within the months of April to September 1986, $400,000 worth of renovations were made, including the addition of a pedestrian bridge over the third and fourth turns connecting the infield to outside viewing areas and additional concrete barriers. In 1987, two separate fires less than a month apart affected the facility&#x27;s grandstands. The first occurred on April 26 due to a lightning strike, burning around 40% of the frontstretch grandstands. While plans were initiated to both repair and expand seating capacity, in June, another fire affected the frontstretch grandstands; this time due to a blowtorch construction accident. In response, Jobe announced the construction of an enlarged grandstand made out of steel and aluminum with a capacity of 10,000. On November 30, NASCAR spokesman Les Richter announced that PIR was awarded a NASCAR Cup Series race weekend for the following year. To accommodate NASCAR, a $5 million renovation project was implemented, building a new VIP hospitality building, renovating the garage area, extending pit road by , and expanding permanent seating capacity to 30,000 in time for the 1988 Checker 500. The first Cup Series race at the facility ran as scheduled on November 6, with Alan Kulwicki winning the event. The following year, another $2 million was spent on expansion, constructing a four-story VIP suite building on the track&#x27;s first turn, the expansion of permanent seating capacity to &quot;about 42,000&quot;, renovations to the facility&#x27;s scoring tower and media center, and other upgrades related to beautification. In 1990, plans were drafted to add a 5,000-seat grandstand alongside the construction of a new infield road course, with the latter being completed two years later. The facility underwent a $800,000 refurbishment in 1991, adding 700 luxury seats and increased infield parking. That same year, PIR experienced its eighth fatality when USAC Silver Crown Series driver Danny Milburn crashed during a Silver Crown race. In 1993, PIR ran its first night race, installing temporary lights to run a IMSA GT Championship race. By 1995, seating capacity increased to &quot;nearly 60,000&quot;, with Jobe stating that he had invested over $10 million (adjusted for inflation, $) into the facility. In 1997, Arizona Governor Fife Symington approved state funding for a five-lane bridge to be built over the Gila River that addressed long-lasting traffic concerns. 

=== ISC purchase ===
The first rumors of a potential sale of PIR came in November 1996, with the Bruton Smith-owned Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI) being named as potential buyers; according to the &quot;Republic&quot;. Both Jobe and SMI spokesman Humpy Wheeler denied the rumor, with Jobe stating he was getting &quot;a little irritated&quot; at the rumor. Jobe reaffirmed his position in another &quot;Republic&quot; interview on March 22, 1997, stating, &quot;How much stronger can I make this? I&#x27;m not selling.&quot; However, on July 14, the &quot;Republic&quot; reported that PIR was &quot;likely&quot; purchased by the Florida-based International Speedway Corporation (ISC). The purchase was confirmed in a press conference that same day, with ISC paying $46 million for the facility; Jobe remained as the president of PIR. In 1998, a new 5,000-seat grandstand in the track&#x27;s second turn named in honor of Bobby Allison was announced to increase seating capacity to &quot;more than 72,000&quot;. Three years later, a new scoring pylon was built to replace the tower built in 1988. In 2002, Jobe retired as president of PIR, with Watkins Glen International president Bryan Sperber replacing Jobe as president of PIR. The following year, the track&#x27;s dogleg was also reconfigured, with the dogleg being made wider for both increased safety and passing opportunities. The turn two wall was also extended to fully enclose the track. The project started in May and was completed in October for testing. In December, PIR began installing SAFER barriers around the oval track&#x27;s perimeter; the installation was complete by January 2004.

PIR officials began lobbying for a second NASCAR Cup Series race weekend in February 2003. Despite Sperber stating the track was not seeking to install permanent lighting in January 2003, PIR officials initiated negotiations with Arizona politicians to use tax revenue to construct lights and other road renovations in further efforts to allure a second Cup Series weekend. After failing to receive it for 2004, a second Cup Series weekend for 2005 was officially awarded on May 14 after Arizona government officials approved an allocation of $5 million in state funding to renovate roads near PIR. A $5 million permanent lighting system to host night racing was installed soon after, being completed in March 2005. In 2006, new amenities were constructed, including an extension of the Allison Grandstand to 14,000 seats and a new luxury lounge. In 2010, seating capacity was reduced to 55,000 when seats were widened to . 

=== 2011 reconfiguration and 2018 renovations ===

On November 19, 2010, ISC officials announced a $100 million long-term project aimed at PIR&#x27;s &quot;development&quot;. Approximately four months later, PIR track officials announced a repave and reconfiguration of the oval track; among said changes stated were the widening of the frontstretch by to , the track&#x27;s pit road being pushed back, and the dogleg being &quot;pushed out&quot; by . Additionally, the apron underneath the dogleg, which at the time was covered in grass, was paved over, subsequently leading to drivers often cutting the dogleg apron. A ceremonial groundbreaking ceremony featuring driver Jeff Gordon breaking the old pavement apart with an excavator was held on February 27, and construction began by April. The repave was completed by October of that year for testing, and it received positive reactions from numerous drivers, including Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards. Despite changes, both attendance and seating capacity continued to decline; by 2014, capacity decreased further to 50,000 according to the &quot;Republic&quot;.

On November 17, 2016, &quot;NBC Sports&quot; reported that PIR officials submitted a renovation project for ISC officials to approve. 13 days later, the ISC board of directors approved the $178 million project. Within the project, plans were made to demolish the frontstretch grandstands, extend the Allison Grandstand, redesign the track&#x27;s infield, shift the start-finish line to after turn two and before the dogleg, add additional suites, and implement other modernization improvements. In September 2017, Ingenuity Sun Media (ISM) bought the naming rights for PIR starting in 2018, with the track being renamed to &quot;ISM Raceway&quot;. On August 20, 2018, Sperber announced his retirement as president of the facility, with ISC Design &amp; Development director of business operations Julie Giese being named as Sperber&#x27;s replacement. The renovation project was completed in time for the 2018 Can-Am 500. In 2019, seating capacity decreased to 42,000 according to ISC archive records. That same year, ownership of the facility was transferred to the sanctioning body of NASCAR when ISC was bought out by NASCAR. The following year, ISM and the speedway ended their naming rights relationship despite a 10-year deal, with the track renaming itself to &quot;Phoenix Raceway&quot;. In November 2022, Giese stepped down as president of Phoenix Raceway to run operations for the Chicago Street Course, with Bell Bank executive Latasha Causey taking over the position.

=== Racing events ===

==== NASCAR ====

As of 2024, the track holds two annual NASCAR race weekends: the spring Shriners Children&#x27;s 500 and the fall NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race. The former was first run in 2005 in the aftermath of the Ferko lawsuit, which gave a second Cup Series race to the facility from Darlington Raceway. The latter was first run in 1988 as Phoenix Raceway&#x27;s first NASCAR Cup Series race. In 2020, the fall race was moved from the penultimate race of the NASCAR Cup Series season to the final race, subsequently becoming the championship race. Along with its Cup Series races, the facility also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series support races, including the GOVX 200, the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship Race, and the NASCAR Truck Series Championship Race. 

==== Open-wheel racing ====
Phoenix Raceway has held numerous open-wheel racing events under various sanctioning bodies: primarily under the United States Auto Club (USAC), Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), and IndyCar. Until the mid-1980s, the facility held two annual open-wheel races a year: the Jimmy Bryan Memorial and the Bobby Ball Memorial. Both iterations were inaugurated in 1964, and were held annually by USAC until 1979, when both events were taken by CART. The Bobby Ball Memorial ran until 1986, when it was dropped from the 1987 CART season.

After 1986, the Jimmy Bryan Memorial was held and organized by CART until 1996, when control of the event was turned over to the Indy Racing League (IRL) in the midst of the CART–IRL split. The race remained on the schedule until 2005, when it was dropped for the 2006 season. Open-wheel racing did not come back to Phoenix Raceway until 2016, when IndyCar, formerly the IRL, returned. However, the event was dropped after 2018; according to IndyCar, the reason was due to poor attendance &quot;despite considerable investment from both sides&quot;.

==== Other racing events ====

*From 1977 until 2009, Phoenix Raceway hosted the annual Copper World Classic, a multi-division race weekend.
*From 1992 to 1995, Phoenix Raceway hosted an annual IMSA GT Championship race.

=== Non-racing events ===
Phoenix Raceway has held various EDM music festivals since the 2020s, including the Goldrush Music Festival, Decadence Arizona, and PHXLIGHTS.

<doc id="973409" wikidata="Q2650986" url="?curid=973409" title="Sikorsky S-29-A">
<text>The Sikorsky S-29-A was a twin-engine sesquiplane airliner, first flown in 1924. It was the first aircraft that aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky designed and built after coming to the United States, hence the special &quot;-A&quot; suffix signifying &quot;America&quot;. The aircraft made many successful long-range flights, most of which Sikorsky piloted himself. The S-29-A claims a number of &quot;firsts&quot; in aviation, including the first twin-engine aircraft capable of maintaining altitude on one engine, the first aircraft to broadcast a radio musical program in-flight, in 1925 and in 1926 the first aircraft to display a motion picture in flight. The S-29-A was also one of the first aircraft to make use of an airstair door, located on the starboard side of the fuselage.

==Design and development==
Sikorsky and his colleagues began work on the machine in the spring of 1923 on a farm near Roosevelt Field on Long Island. The aircraft structure was manufactured from steel with the two bay wire-braced strutted wings made from wood and fabric. The machine featured a twin vertical stabilizer design and was originally fitted with a pair of Hispano-Suiza 8 engines rated at each. The pilot and mechanic sat in an open cockpit halfway between the main wings and the tail, while up to 14 passengers were accommodated forward within the streamlined fuselage.

During the winter of 1923–24 work on the project came to a near stand still due to financial concerns. The famed Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff appeared one day and after a discussion with Sikorsky he donated $5,000 to complete the S-29-A. The first flight, piloted by Sikorsky, was on May 4, 1924 and resulted in a forced landing on a golf course, seriously damaging the aircraft. The crash was caused by low engine speed leading to insufficient thrust due to excessive pitch of the propellers. After rebuilding the aircraft, two Liberty L-12 engines were installed. The second flight on September 25 was very successful. Flight testing revealed that the S-29-A was able to maintain altitude on one engine at a speed of .

==Operational history==
On April 23, 1925 the S-29-A completed its first revenue flight from New York to Washington D.C. The cargo consisted of two Baby Grand pianos, one of which was delivered to the first lady Grace Coolidge. On May 8, 1925 a regular passenger service between New York and Yorktown Virginia began, and the S-29-A was officially christened the &quot;Yorktown&quot; at Bolling Field in Washington, DC. The aircraft made over 300 successful flights, but with the airline industry only just emerging in the United States at that time, the S-29 failed to attract the customers that Sikorsky had hoped.
Eventually Sikorsky sold the S-29-A to Roscoe Turner in 1927 (some sources state 1926), and it had a varied career in merchandising (Curlee Clothing) and acting as a flying cigar store (among other roles).

On April 3, 1928 Turner sold the aircraft to the Caddo Company, Inc. of Hollywood, CA. The President of Caddo, Howard Hughes intended to use it in the making of the movie &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;. The S-29-A was painted and modified to resemble a Gotha heavy bomber. During filming of a dangerous diving spinning stunt on March 22, 1929 at Pacoima, California the linen of the left wing began tearing, and parts of the left engine cowling separated. The pilot, Al Wilson, intended to bail out, and asked the engineer, Phil Jones, to do so as well. According to reports, the engineer did not hear the order coming from the pilot, who abandoned the aircraft shortly later. The aircraft then entered to an uncontrolled descent and crashed, killing the engineer. The pilot parachuted to the ground, uninjured.

<doc id="973410" wikidata="Q1851781" url="?curid=973410" title="Japanese cruiser Myōkō">
<text>was the lead ship of the four-member of heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which were active in World War II. She was named after Mount Myōkō in Niigata Prefecture. The other ships of the class were , , and .

==Background==
&quot;Myōkō&quot; was approved under the 1922–1929 Fleet Modernization Program, as the first heavy cruiser to be built by Japan within the design constraints imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, and was the first of the &quot;10,000 ton&quot; cruisers built by any nation. Naval architect Vice Admiral Yuzuru Hiraga was able to keep the design from becoming dangerously top-heavy in its early years by continually rejecting demands from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff for additional equipment to the upper decks. During modifications and rebuildings in the 1930s, though, the final displacement rose to 15,933 tons, well over the treaty limits.

==Design==

The &quot;Myōkō&quot; class displaced , with a hull design based on an enlarged version of the . &quot;Myōkō&quot; was long, with a beam of and draft of , and was capable of .
Propulsion was by 12 Kampon boilers driving four sets of single-impulse, geared-turbine engines, with four shafts turning three-bladed propellers. The ship was armored with a side belt, and armored deck, but the bridge was not armored.

&quot;Myōkō&quot;’s main battery was ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, the heaviest armament of any heavy cruiser in the world at the time, mounted in five twin turrets. Her secondary armament included eight 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns in four twin mounts on each side, and 12 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes in four triple launchers positioned below the aircraft deck. &quot;Myōkō&quot; was also equipped with an aircraft catapult and carried up to three floatplanes for scouting purposes.

&quot;Myōkō&quot; was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 25 October 1924 and launched and named on 16 April 1927 in a ceremony attended by Emperor Hirohito, and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 31 July 1929. Although the first ship in her class to be laid down, she was the third to be completed.

&quot;Myōkō&quot; was repeatedly modernized and upgraded throughout her career to counter the growing threat of air strikes. She eventually mounted 52 Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun guns and two  antiaircraft guns after her final upgrade.

==Operational history==

===Early service===

All of the &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class cruisers were assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, forming &quot;Sentai&quot;-4 of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and trained as a unit during the 1930s. During a naval review off Kobe on 26 October 1930, stack gases caused problems on the bridge, resulting in a lengthening of the forward smokestack by 2.0 m.

During the First Shanghai Incident of February 1932, the cruisers escorted the transports conveying elements of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) to the continent. In December 1932, the &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class ships were placed in reserve as the new &quot;Takao&quot;-class cruisers were commissioned, becoming the new &quot;Sentai&quot;-4, whereas the &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class ships were shifted to &quot;Sentai&quot;-5. Between 1933 and 1935, all &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class cruisers were retrofitted with their fixed triple torpedo launchers replaced by two quadruple rotatable launchers, and their secondary guns upgraded from 12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval guns to 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns. In 1935, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was damaged in a typhoon as part of the Fourth Fleet incident.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, &quot;Myōkō&quot; participated in the Amoy Operation from 10–12 May 1938 as flagship of &quot;Sentai&quot;-9 of the IJN 5th Fleet along with the Hainan Island Operation in February 1939.
A second reconstruction and retrofit was completed in April 1941, doubling the number of torpedoes to 16, adding another eight 25-mm antiaircraft guns, and bulges to the hull to improve stability.

===Pacific War===

====Invasion of the Philippines====
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; formed &quot;Sentai&quot;-5 of the IJN 3rd Fleet. &quot;Sentai&quot;-5 was commanded by Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi and deployed from Palau cover for the landings of Japanese forces under &quot;Operation M&quot; — the invasion of the southern Philippine Islands. After covering the landings of Japanese forces at Legaspi on 11 December 1941, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; returned to Palau and were then reassigned to the Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, whose attack force covered landings at Davao on 19 December and Jolo on 24 December.

On 4 January 1942, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and the other vessels of Admiral Tanaka’s invasion force were attacked by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress bombers while at anchor at Davao. &quot;Myōkō&quot; was hit by one bomb, causing only superficial damage, but she was drydocked at Sasebo Naval Arsenal for repairs.

====Battle of the Java Sea====
In the Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March 1942 &quot;Myōkō&quot;, &quot;Nachi&quot;, and &quot;Haguro&quot; participated in the destruction of the last remaining Allied fleet units in the Netherlands East Indies. At 11:50, &quot;Myōkō&quot;, and destroyers and opened fire on the damaged British heavy cruiser and her escort of two destroyers. During the engagement, the 8-inch guns of &quot;Myōkō&quot; combined fire with &quot;Ashigara&quot; to sink the destroyer , while &quot;Nachi&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; combined fire to finish off &quot;Exeter&quot;.

Later in March, &quot;Myōkō&quot; received a refit at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. In April, she participated in the unsuccessful pursuit of the Doolittle raid task force.

====Battle of the Coral Sea====
In May, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was part of the carrier strike force during the Operation Mo that resulted in the Tulagi invasion force and subsequently the Battle of the Coral Sea. She served as a flagship of Vice Admiral Takagi, who was in the overall command of the carrier strike force, which consisted of the aircraft carriers and , which were under a tactical command of Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, the heavy cruisers &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot;, and five destroyers. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was damaged by American aircraft and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; lost most of her aircraft in the Battle of the Coral Sea, forcing the flotilla to withdraw without invading Port Moresby.

====Battle of Midway====
In June, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was part of Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s support force in the Battle of Midway, which included the battleships and , the heavy cruisers &quot;Haguro&quot;, and , the light cruiser , the light aircraft carrier , and seven destroyers. The support force returned to Sendai in northern Japan on 23 June without engaging the enemy in this battle, and &quot;Myōkō&quot; was sent out on 28 June as escort for the reinforcement convoy in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. This force included the aircraft carrier &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, the light aircraft carriers &quot;Zuihō&quot;, , and , the heavy cruisers , , &quot;Myōkō&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot;, and &quot;Nachi&quot;, and the light cruisers , , and . &quot;Myōkō&quot; returned to Hashirajima on 12 July 1942.

====The Solomon Islands campaign====
On 11 October 1942, &quot;Myōkō&quot; sailed from Truk as part of the IJN 2nd Fleet. This force also included the battleships &quot;Kongō&quot; and , the heavy cruisers &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Chōkai&quot;, and &quot;Nachi&quot;, the light cruiser , and 12 destroyers. They were followed by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo&#x27;s carrier strike force. The mission was the reinforcement and resupply of Japanese troops on the island of Guadalcanal, which had been invaded by American troops in August. &quot;Myōkō&quot; was attacked on 14 September by a flight of 10 USAAF B-17 bombers, suffering light damage. On 15 October, she participated in a shore bombardment operation against the American-held Henderson Field together with &quot;Maya&quot;.

Between 31 January and 9 February 1943, &quot;Myōkō&quot;, after a refit at Sasebo, took part in the evacuation of Guadalcanal. The force consisted of the carriers &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, &quot;Zuihō&quot;, and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;, the battleships &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot;, heavy cruisers &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Myōkō&quot;, and &quot;Haguro&quot;, the light cruisers and , and 11 destroyers. The Japanese transports were successful in evacuating 11,700 troops from the island.

====Later campaigns====
In May 1943, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; sailed north to assist in the evacuation of Kiska. In June, they returned to Sasebo for another refit. &quot;Myōkō&quot; was equipped with four twin Type 96 25 mm AT/AA gun mounts, and a Type 21 air search radar set was also installed.

In response to American carrier aircraft raiding in the Gilbert Islands, &quot;Myōkō&quot; sortied with Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s fleet to engage the American carriers. The fleet consisted of the aircraft carriers &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, and &quot;Zuihō&quot;, the battleships and , heavy cruisers &quot;Myōkō&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot;, , , , &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Chōkai&quot;, and , the light cruiser &quot;Agano&quot;, and 15 destroyers. Despite extensive searches, this force failed to make contact with the American strike force and returned to Truk.

On 1 November, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot; sailed south from Truk with two destroyers, escorting a supply convoy to Rabaul. From Rabaul, &quot;Myōkō&quot; sailed with the light cruisers &quot;Agano&quot; and and six destroyers to escort reinforcements to the island of Bougainville. About 1,000 Japanese Army troops were carried by four fast destroyer transports. The warships sailed ahead of the transports and engaged an American force in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay at 12:50 on 3 November.

The American force of four light cruisers and eight destroyers sank the &quot;Sendai&quot; with 6-inch (152 mm) gunfire. While avoiding the American gunfire, &quot;Myōkō&quot; collided with the destroyer . &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; fell behind the task force as it withdrew, and was finished off by American gunfire. &quot;Haguro&quot; had received minor damage in the action, and the American destroyer was crippled by a Long Lance torpedo.

On 17 November, &quot;Myōkō&quot; arrived at Sasebo for another refit. Eight single-mount 25 mm AA guns were added, bringing the total to 24 guns. In January, &quot;Myōkō&quot; (with &quot;Tone&quot; and two destroyers) made an uneventful transport run from Truk to Kavieng and back. On 10 February, while sailing from Truk to Palau with &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Chōkai&quot; and eight destroyers, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was attacked by the submarine . The submarine fired four torpedoes, but all missed.

In March, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and the destroyer escorted an empty tanker convoy from Palau to Borneo. On 6 April, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was attacked by the submarine . She fired all six bow torpedo tubes, but missed. The submarine also spotted &quot;Myōkō&quot;, but was unable to maneuver into position for an attack.

==== Battle of the Philippine Sea====
In June 1944, &quot;Myōkō&quot; participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The Japanese fleet sailed from its anchorage at Tawi Tawi in response to the American invasion of the Marianas Islands. The Japanese high command was aware that American heavy bombers, based in the Marianas, could reach factories and shipyards in the Japanese home islands. This battle was later called the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot; by American sailors, because over 300 Japanese carrier aircraft were shot down in a single day on 19 June.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
&quot;Myōkō&quot; participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf as part of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s First Mobile Striking Force (Center Force) consisting of four battleships and 10 cruisers. As the Center Force tried to force a passage through the Sibuyan Sea, it was spotted and attacked by US Task Force 38. Although most airstrikes concentrated on the battleship , &quot;Myōkō&quot; was hit by a torpedo aft on the starboard side, which damaged her starboard screws. She broke off and headed for Singapore at a reduced speed of , arriving on 2 November 1944. After temporary repairs, she departed for Japan with a stop at Cam Ranh Bay.

==== Fate ====
En route to Cam Ranh Bay, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was hit by one torpedo from a spread of six, fired by the submarine at 17:35 on 13 December 1944 on her aft port side, blowing away her stern, and leaving her unable to steer. She went dead in the water. Despite the extensive damage to the aft, one port screw remained operable and she could make . Unable to steer, she was towed by destroyer (which assisted in damaging &quot;Bergall&quot;, which survived and returned to Fremantle) and several other ships to Singapore harbor for repairs, but materials in Singapore were insufficient to complete the repairs for both &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Takao&quot;, the latter which had been severely damaged by two submarine-launched torpedoes prior to the Sibuyan Sea battle.

In February 1945, the harbor commander reported that &quot;Myōkō&quot; was irreparable at Singapore without more materials, and impossible to tow to Japan. He recommended that &quot;Myōkō&quot; be kept in Singapore as a floating antiaircraft battery, and this suggestion was approved. Both &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Takao&quot; were targeted by British midget submarine attacks on 26 July, but survived the war.

&quot;Myōkō&quot; formally surrendered to Royal Navy units on 21 September 1945, and was subsequently towed to the Strait of Malacca and scuttled off Port Swettenham, Malaya (near present-day Port Klang, Malaysia) at on 8 July 1946, near submarines and .

<text>Masters at Work is the American garage house production and remix team of &quot;Little&quot; Louie Vega and Kenny &quot;Dope&quot; Gonzalez. The duo has produced music together under the names MAW, KenLou, Sole Fusion, Hardrive, and Nuyorican Soul. They have been referred to as one of the most influential artists in the history of house music.

==Biography==

In the late 1980s, Kenny &quot;Dope&quot; Gonzalez organized a series of block parties with his friend Mike Delgado under the name &quot;Masters at Work&quot;. Gonzalez loaned the name to Todd Terry for his 1987 singles &quot;Alright Alright&quot; and &quot;Dum Dum Cry&quot;, with editing by Mike Delgado and Franklin Martinez. Terry had attended Gonzalez&#x27;s parties and became influential to him. When Vega was hired to mix one of Terry&#x27;s freestyles, this eventually led him to meeting Gonzalez. Gonzalez and Vega then started using the name &quot;Masters at Work&quot; in 1990. 

In 1993, the duo also created the Nuyorican Soul moniker, blending their residence in New York City, Puerto Rican heritage, and affinity for soul music. Their Nuyorican Soul project had the duo working extensively with real (as opposed to sampled or synthesized) musicians, in a variety of styles including Latin, disco, jazz, and more. Musicians who took part in this project included Vincent Montana Jr., Roy Ayers, George Benson, Jocelyn Brown, Tito Puente, and members of the Salsoul Orchestra. 

The self-titled album released under the name Nuyorican Soul in 1996, included original tracks as well as cover versions of songs by the performers with which the duo was working, such as &quot;Sweet Tears&quot; (Roy Ayers), and &quot;Runaway&quot;, originally sung by Loleatta Holloway with the Salsoul Orchestra, here sung by India and featuring musicians from the original 1977 recording.

They have been nominated three times for the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.

In 2021, they relaunched MAW Records, with their first new track release in 20 years.

== Legacy ==
Remixing of their tracks by UK DJs in the &#x27;90s helped to create the speed garage genre. They have been credited with generating the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Latin house. &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; referred to the duo as potentially &quot;the most influential pairing in the history of house&quot;. 

MAW has a history as remixers, having reproduced tracks for various acts both inside and outside the world of dance music. Some of the artists remixed by the two producers include Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Donna Summer, Aaliyah, Gus Gus, Jody Watley, Jamiroquai, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Stephanie Mills, Spice Girls, Daft Punk and Los Amigos Invisibles.

Their 1991 single &quot;The Ha Dance&quot; became highly influential in the black and Latino LGBT ballroom scene. The beat has been sampled and remixed so many times that it has become almost synonymous with ballroom music. The song&#x27;s &quot;Ha&quot; on the four-beat &quot;intertwines with ballroom&#x27;s ‘dip’ element of basically falling to the ground in a dramatic &quot;or&quot; soft way.&quot;

<text>Robert Andrew Berdella Jr. (January 31, 1949October 8, 1992) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered at least six young men after forcing his victims to endure periods of up to six weeks of captivity. His crimes took place in Kansas City, Missouri, between 1984 and 1987.

Describing his murders as being &quot;some of my darkest fantasies becoming my reality&quot;, Berdella pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first-degree murder of one of his victims, Larry Pearson, in August 1988; he would later plead guilty to one further charge of first-degree murder and four charges of second-degree murder in December 1988. He died of a heart attack while incarcerated at the Missouri State Penitentiary in October 1992.

Berdella became known as the Kansas City Butcher due to his practice of extensively dissecting his victims&#x27; bodies, which he would then dispose of in garbage bags, and The Collector due to the movie which he stated was the basis of the fantasies behind the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of his crimes.

==Early life==
Robert Berdella was born on January 31, 1949, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the first of two sons born to Robert Andrew Berdella Sr., a die setter for the Ford Motor Company, and Mary Louise ( Huffman) Berdella. Berdella&#x27;s father was a devout Roman Catholic of Italian descent, while his mother was of German and British descent. The family regularly attended Mass, and both sons regularly attended religious education courses.

As a child, Berdella was intelligent but a loner who rarely played outside his home and seldom had friends visit to socialize. He had a speech impediment and wore thick glasses from the age of five because he was severely nearsighted; he was also diagnosed with high blood pressure, for which he took several medications. Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel, seven years his junior, displayed an aptitude for sports from an early age. Berdella&#x27;s father valued sports and physical education and viewed his older son&#x27;s lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure, often comparing him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella&#x27;s father physically and emotionally abused his children, such as by beating them with a leather strap.

Berdella performed well academically, though teachers often found him difficult to teach, partly due to his aloofness and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Because of this, he seldom socialized with his peers.

When Berdella reached puberty, he discovered that he was homosexual; initially, he kept this fact a closely guarded secret, and he did not become open about his sexuality for several years. Nonetheless, in his early teens, he briefly had a girlfriend.

===Adolescence===
By his mid-teens, Berdella had begun to display a degree of aggression, becoming rude and condescending to others, particularly women. He learned about cooking and art and developed showmanship. On Christmas Day 1965, the Berdella family drove to Canton, Ohio to visit relatives. That evening, Berdella&#x27;s father had a heart attack at the age of 39. Two days later, Berdella returned to Cuyahoga Falls by himself. When he arrived home, his family told him his father had died. Berdella sought solace in his Catholicism, reading extensively about many faiths. He eventually became cynical about all religion.

In 1965, Berdella saw the film adaptation of the John Fowles novel &quot;The Collector&quot;. The plot of the film revolves around a disturbed man who stalks and then abducts a young woman whom he finds attractive, holding her captive in his windowless stone basement and viewing her as little more than an attractive specimen. After several weeks, the woman dies of a contracted illness despite her captor&#x27;s efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated that this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.

Shortly after the death of Berdella&#x27;s father, his mother remarried, an action that was met with resentment by Berdella, who viewed it as a form of betrayal against his father. As a result, he became increasingly withdrawn and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood, such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as Vietnam and Burma and their sending him stamps, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture, would lead to his avid interest in primitive art, photographs, and antiques. From approximately 1965, he began collecting such artifacts; this practice would inspire him to open his own antiques business in 1982.

==Relocation to Kansas City==

===College years===
In the summer of 1967, Berdella graduated from Cuyahoga Falls High School. Throughout his studies in high school, he had earned such excellent grades and showed such potential that in 1966, one teacher had placed him in an independent study program. Shortly after graduation, Berdella relocated to Kansas City, enrolling in the Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI), with aspirations of becoming a college professor. In his first year at the KCAI, Berdella was considered an attentive and talented student, although by his second year, he became vocally anti-authoritarian, becoming acquainted with a clique of students who supplied him with drugs, which he then sold to other students at a profit. In addition, he began regularly abusing alcohol. He also engaged in acts of animal torture on at least two occasions; during one of these instances, he decapitated a duck in the presence of his peers, and in the second, he experimented with sedatives and tranquilizers on a dog.

At the age of 19, Berdella was arrested for attempting to sell methamphetamine to an undercover officer; he was released after posting a $3,000 bond (equivalent to about $27,200 ). He would later plead guilty to the offense and was handed a five-year suspended sentence. One month after this first arrest, Berdella and two other students were arrested for possession of marijuana and LSD in Johnson County. On this occasion, Berdella could not post bond, and he spent five days in jail; the charges against him and one of the other students would be dropped due to a lack of evidence.

===4315 Charlotte Street===
In 1969, Berdella voluntarily withdrew from KCAI after receiving harsh criticism from college administrators for killing and cooking a duck for the sake of art. He chose to remain in Kansas City and in September of that year, he moved into an address within the Hyde Park district: 4315 Charlotte Street. By this stage, Berdella had been openly gay for several years. He began spending much of his free time with male prostitutes, drug addicts, petty criminals, and runaways. Berdella would typically befriend these individuals, then &quot;try to help free them from their drug addictions or criminal lifestyles&quot;, though he was adamant that, throughout much of the 1970s, he had no physical contact whatsoever with any of them.

To several of his neighbors, Berdella stated that he felt almost like a foster parent to many of these youths. By the early 1980s, many of his older acquaintances had ceased having any form of social contact with him. Berdella increasingly relied on these young men as a source of companionship and friendship. He would later claim to have become increasingly frustrated that many of these individuals were ignorant of his efforts to help steer them away from self-destructive behavior.

Despite these later claims, Berdella would often engage in sexual relations with the men he befriended, and would establish a degree of control over them, in part to engage in these sexual relations, by loaning them money and allowing them to live rent-free at his house for periods of time.

To his neighbors, Berdella was considered flamboyant yet helpful and civic-minded, despite the generally unkempt state of his property and his somewhat haughty attitude. Beginning in the late 1970s, Berdella worked with the South Hyde Park Crime Prevention and Neighborhood Association, becoming their chairman in the early 1980s and encouraging neighborhood watch patrols. He remained active in the association until the mid-1980s, when he left his position. Berdella also volunteered at fundraising events for a local public television station until the mid-1980s.

Shortly before Berdella moved into his Charlotte Street address, he began working as a short-order cook in various restaurants around Kansas City, in part to help pay lawyer fees and fines accrued from his previous drug arrests. For additional income, he also sold art and antiques he had collected via contacts he had established in Africa, Asia, South America, and various Pacific Rim countries. He initially operated this side business from his home.

Both Berdella&#x27;s cooking career and the antiques business flourished, and by the mid-1970s he began working as a senior cook at several renowned Kansas City restaurants. He joined a local chefs&#x27; association and helped establish a training program for aspiring chefs at a local community college. At the same time, he devoted more attention to his own business. By 1981 he had established several contractual agreements with both national and international contacts for his antiques business. He viewed this as his full-time job and later ceased working as a chef.

==Bob&#x27;s Bazaar Bizarre==
In 1982, Berdella began renting his own booth at the Westport Flea Market. This store was named Bob&#x27;s Bazaar Bizarre, and primarily sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income from this business was insufficient to maintain his expenses and make ends meet. As a result, Berdella would occasionally steal or scavenge items to sell at his booth. He would also take lodgers at his home as a means of gaining additional income.

At the flea market, Berdella became acquainted with a fellow merchant named Paul Howell, who operated a booth adjacent to his own. Soon, Berdella became acquainted with Paul Howell&#x27;s younger son, Jerry. Initially, Jerry Howell and his friends taunted Berdella for his overt homosexuality, although according to Berdella, Jerry Howell later confided to him that he and his friends occasionally earned money as male prostitutes.

By the early 1980s, Paul Howell had relocated his business to a store close to the intersection of 39th and Main Street, with his family living in an apartment above the shop. Berdella remained a casual friend of the family, offering his assistance if Jerry encountered any minor scrapes with the law. By the summer of 1984, Jerry Howell had turned 19.

==Murders==
===First known victim===
Berdella is believed to have killed his first victim on July 5, 1984; he was 19-year-old Jerry Howell. Berdella had promised to drive the youth to attend a dancing contest in Merriam. According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, diazepam, and acepromazine both in his car and at his house until he became unconscious. He then injected Howell with a heavy tranquilizer before binding him to his bed.

Howell was restrained to Berdella&#x27;s bed for approximately 28 hours. Throughout this period of captivity, Berdella repeatedly drugged, tortured, raped, and violated him with foreign objects, repeatedly ignoring Howell&#x27;s queries as to why he was being treated this way and his pleas to be freed. According to Berdella, Jerry &quot;either asphyxiated on [his own] vomit, or the combination of the gag and the medicines were too strong for him to be able to catch breath&quot;.

Berdella would later state that he briefly attempted to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation upon Howell after he had died, then dragged his body to the basement. He suspended Howell&#x27;s body above a large cooking pot and made several incisions to his inner elbows and jugular vein, leaving the body suspended in this position overnight to allow the blood to drain from his corpse. The following day, he dismembered Howell&#x27;s body using a chainsaw and boning knives and wrapped the sections in newspaper and trash bags. These bags were later placed inside larger trash bags, which Berdella placed outside for a garbage crew to collect and take to a landfill site.

When later questioned by officers investigating Howell&#x27;s disappearance, Berdella claimed to have driven the youth to Merriam as promised, where the two had parted company close to Howell&#x27;s intended destination. Berdella further claimed he had not seen him since.
As would be the case with all of Berdella&#x27;s murders, he kept a detailed log in which he documented each act of sexual and physical torture inflicted upon his victim. Berdella would recall that, like his subsequent victims, Howell had repeatedly pleaded with Berdella to stop the abuse and torture, although Berdella would either ignore these pleas, taunt his victim, or threaten him. He would remain adamant to investigators that this was not for his enjoyment, but for what he called his &quot;physical and mental satisfaction&quot;.

===Subsequent murders===
On April 10, 1985, an itinerant former lodger, 20-year-old Robert Sheldon, arrived on Berdella&#x27;s doorstep, asking if he could stay at his house for a short time. According to Berdella, although Sheldon paid his rent responsibly, he considered him to be &quot;an inconvenience&quot;. Although he was not physically attracted to Sheldon, on April 12, he drugged and held him captive because he returned home from work to find Sheldon intoxicated. Berdella was adamant that he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as someone upon whom he could &quot;express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on&quot;.

Sheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second-floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of drain cleaner in his left eye, the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips, the binding of his wrists with piano wire with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands, and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his hearing capacity.

Three days after Berdella had begun holding Sheldon captive, on April15, a workman came to perform some scheduled work on the roof of his home, leading Berdella to fatally suffocate Sheldon by placing a sack over his head, which he then tightened with a piece of rope. He later dissected Sheldon&#x27;s body in the third-floor bathroom.

The following June, Berdella found Mark Wallace (a very casual acquaintance who had previously helped him with yard work) hiding in his tool shed to seek shelter from a severe thunderstorm. As had been the case with Robert Sheldon, Berdella invited him inside his house, and, noting Wallace&#x27;s acute state of tenseness and depression, volunteered to inject him with chlorpromazine with the explanation this would &quot;calm down and relax&quot; him. Wallace willingly accepted the offer and, 30 minutes later, Berdella decided to render him captive.

Wallace was carried to the second floor bedroom where he endured almost a day of captivity and torture including the application of alligator clips to his nipples to facilitate electrical shocks to his body at any point at which Wallace began regressing into a state of unconsciousness. According to Berdella, one hour after his &quot;experimenting&quot; with hypodermic needles by inserting them into various muscles upon his victim&#x27;s back, Mark Wallace died through a combination of &quot;the drugs, the gag, and the lack of oxygen&quot;. He noted this victim&#x27;s time of death as being 7:00 p.m. on June 23.

===Increase in brutality===
On September 26, 1985, Berdella answered a phone call from an acquaintance named James Ferris who asked to stay at Berdella&#x27;s home for a short time. Berdella agreed, with the intention of kidnapping Ferris, whom he arranged to meet at a bar that evening. Despite the brutality to which he had subjected his first three victims, Berdella claimed that Ferris was the first victim upon whom he intentionally inflicted torture. He also informed investigators that there were occasions during his final three victims&#x27; periods of captivity when he ceased making additions to his abuse-logs because he assumed the victim would not &quot;be able to make it much longer&quot;.

Berdella brought Ferris home and drugged him with crushed tranquilizers concealed in a meal, then tied him to his bed before torturing him almost constantly for approximately 27hours. The torture included the repeated administration of 7,700-volt electrical shocks to the shoulder and testicles for up to five minutes in each instance, and acupuncture via hypodermic needles to the neck and genitals. Ferris gradually became delirious, but Berdella continued his physical and sexual assaults until he noted in his log that Ferris was &quot;Unable to sit up more than &quot;. The next entry read &quot;Very delayed breathing&quot;, and finally, Berdella noted that Ferris died with a slang term he had used in his career as a chef, &quot;86&quot;, which Berdella later explained &quot;meant anything from &#x27;Throw it out&#x27; to &#x27;Stop the project.

Todd Stoops was a 23-year-old drug addict and occasional prostitute who, with his wife, had twice lived briefly at Berdella&#x27;s house in 1984. After Stoops and his wife moved out of Berdella&#x27;s home the second time, Berdella did not see him again until a chance encounter at Kansas City&#x27;s Liberty Memorial Park on June 17, 1986. Berdella invited him to his house with an offer of lunch, with an added incentive of sex as Stoops stated he needed $13 to purchase drugs (the equivalent of about $37 )

Berdella would later stress to investigators he had been extremely physically attracted to Stoops, and this victim was held captive for two weeks before he died. He gradually increased Stoops&#x27; terror, attempting to make him a cooperative and incapacitated sex slave. Berdella used electrical shocks through Stoops&#x27; closed eyes in an attempt to blind him, and injected drain cleaner into his larynx to try to silence his screaming.

During the second week of his capture, Stoops asked Berdella for a soft drink and sandwich. When Berdella refused, Stoops burst into tears. On June 27, he ruptured Stoops&#x27; anal wall with his fist, causing bleeding and discharge. Towards the end of Stoops&#x27; captivity, he tried to feed his captive ice cream and soup, although Stoops &quot;wasn&#x27;t able to keep anything down&quot;. By the final day of his captivity, Stoops was so weak Berdella later stated he had been unable &quot;to breathe in a sitting position&quot;. On July 1, 1986, Stoops died; a forensic pathologist later testified that the ruptured anal wall caused septic shock which proved fatal.

In the spring of 1987, Berdella became friendly with 20-year-old Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both witchcraft and wizardry. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home as a means of paying rent. According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture Pearson, but began forming the plan to do so on June 23, two weeks after having bailed Pearson out of jail and noting Pearson—in the weeks prior to his captivity—displayed little interest in finding a job.

On the afternoon of June 23, Berdella and Pearson watched the movie &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; together before eating lunch. As the two &quot;[drove] around&quot; Kansas, the young man began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in Wichita; this disclosure finalized Berdella&#x27;s decision to hold Pearson captive. That evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became intoxicated before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson&#x27;s hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson&#x27;s larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an electrical transformer to the basement.

According to Berdella, Pearson was by far the most cooperative of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an iron rod to render him submissive, Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse. As a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he would not continue to inflict as much pain upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, so that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or return to the basement.

After six weeks of captivity, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella&#x27;s penis before screaming he could not continue to tolerate his ongoing poor treatment. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb, then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to the hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson&#x27;s body was later dismembered in the basement, and his head initially stored in a plastic bag inside Berdella&#x27;s freezer before being buried in the backyard.
==Final victim==
At 1:00 a.m. on March 29, 1988, Berdella abducted his last victim, a 22-year-old male prostitute named Christopher Bryson, whom he lured to his house upon the promise of payment for sex. At Berdella&#x27;s home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella&#x27;s bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson&#x27;s case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed his eyes with ammonia, before exclaiming to him: &quot;The only things you need to think about are you, me, and this house.&quot;

After several days, Berdella explained to Bryson that he had begun to &quot;trust&quot; his captive, and that although he was willing to discuss some aspects of the abuse and torture he was receiving, there would be no negotiations regarding his sexual abuse. Berdella finished this discussion with a stern warning: &quot;I&#x27;ve gotten this far with other people before, and they&#x27;re dead now, because of mistakes they made.&quot;

===Escape===
By the third day of his capture, Bryson had earned sufficient trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a daily regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than to the bed above his head, upon the excuse that his doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms. He had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on in the room with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. Bryson later stated to investigators that he thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to work.

Wearing nothing but a dog collar, Bryson managed to escape from the house by jumping from a second-floor window, breaking a bone in his foot. He ran toward a meter reader who was walking down the other side of the street, shouting for him to call the police. The meter reader led Bryson to the house he had been approaching; the occupants called the police, who arrived minutes later.

Questioned at the scene by four officers, Bryson initially claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before he escaped by jumping from a window on the second floor of the property. Berdella had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain discreet surveillance of the property; Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center for treatment, accompanied by a third officer, while the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) to request a formal search warrant of the property.

==Arrest==
During later questioning at the KCPD, Bryson divulged that his captor had shown him Polaroid images of men who appeared to be deceased, and that he was told that he would never leave the property and that if he became a nuisance or threat, he would either be subjected to greater levels of torture than what he had already endured, or simply be killed.

===Search warrant===
On the afternoon of Bryson&#x27;s escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson&#x27;s claims of having been restrained and tortured in a second-floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom on the second floor had burnt ropes attached to the posts at the foot of the bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer plugged into a wall, with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops were also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to them, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.

Searching the house and grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet on the second floor of his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella&#x27;s basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.

Three hundred and thirty-four Polaroid pictures and 34 snapshot prints of various men were also found in Berdella&#x27;s house. These pictures showed Christopher Bryson and several other men both in life and in death; many of the images had been taken while the subjects were being tortured. The search also uncovered numerous restraints and sexual devices, pornographic literature, hypodermic needles, and a book on narcotics. Officers also discovered a stenographer&#x27;s pad containing detailed torture logs that Berdella had maintained for each victim lying atop a chest of drawers. Several newspaper clippings from &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; mentioning a missing young man named Jerry Howell, and a wallet and driver&#x27;s license belonging to a missing person named James Ferris were discovered in a closet on the second floor of the property.

===Task force and further investigation===
Before the search of Berdella&#x27;s property had concluded, the KCPD assembled a special task force of 11 detectives and one sergeant to focus exclusively on the Berdella case. This task force extensively researched Berdella&#x27;s history, discovering that he was well known among Kansas City&#x27;s male hustlers, having earned a reputation for preying on transient young men. Several of these male prostitutes were also reluctant to accept him as a client both because of his penchant for drugging, injecting, and torturing his sexual partners and acquaintances, and also because he had long been considered a suspect in the disappearance of the two men whose personal possessions had been found in his house (Jerry Howell and James Ferris).

Missing person reports had been filed for both of these men, and Berdella had been extensively questioned in relation to these disappearances; he denied having anything to do with the disappearances. Despite being considered a prime suspect in both cases and being placed under surveillance, police had been unable to find any solid evidence linking him to either man&#x27;s disappearance. In both instances, after giving his initial statement to police, Berdella indignantly refused to talk further without having a lawyer present. His lawyer would later threaten to file harassment accusations against police unless their questioning and surveillance of him ceased.

James Ferris&#x27;s wife identified him in several Polaroids found at Berdella&#x27;s property, some taken after her husband&#x27;s death. Paul Howell formally identified one picture of a young man hanging upside down in Berdella&#x27;s basement as his son. Several other Polaroid images depicted as-yet unidentified young men, and several detectives were assigned to identify them to determine if they were alive or dead and, if alive, the circumstances of the picture. Since several of these images depicted a section of the body of the photographer, on April 13, Berdella was ordered to pose nude for a series of photographs in the same precise angles as the evidence photos for comparison with the original Polaroid images.

As numerous male names had been found scrawled upon various stenographer&#x27;s pads at Berdella&#x27;s address, the detectives began attempting to trace each of them. One of those traced, a young man named Freddie Kellogg, was able to state to detectives that he and several other young men had intermittently lodged with Berdella since the early 1980s, and that Berdella had been in the habit of plying his lodgers with drugstypically intravenouslybefore engaging in sex with them regardless of whether they consented or not.

Kellogg stated that in order for him to be allowed to lodge with Berdella, he must agree to persuade young men whom Berdella found attractive to attend parties at Charlotte Street so that Berdella could drug them. Should Berdella ever discover that any of them was a police informant, he would use this knowledge to blackmail him. Despite this threat, Kellogg stated that numerous male prostitutes and addicts had been reluctant to engage in any form of contact with Berdella because of rumors of his links to the 1984 disappearance of Jerry Howell.

In addition to these disclosures, Kellogg was able to name three of the men depicted in the Polaroids as Todd Stoops, Robert Sheldon, and Larry Wayne Pearson. The investigators would discover that Berdella had paid a $30 fee to secure a bond for Pearson in June 1987 (the equivalent of about $83 ), and that no further records existed to indicate that Pearson was still alive. Nonetheless, investigators did discover that in August 1987, Berdella had filed an assault report from a hospital room, alleging that a man named &quot;Larry Person&quot; had deeply bitten his penis during oral sex, causing a serious laceration. An interview with Robert Sheldon&#x27;s employers at a Kansas City manufacturing plant confirmed that although the young man had been a reliable employee, he had suddenly ceased attending work in April 1985.

Shortly after the search of 4315 Charlotte Street had concluded, Berdella was informed of the discoveries at his property. The same afternoon he was ordered to pose for the series of nude photographs for comparison with the Polaroid images he had taken, investigators attempted to conduct their first formal investigation with him, although Berdella simply invoked his right to silence in this setting. (Investigators later sought to obtain handwriting samples from Berdella in an effort to prove he had written the notes found within the various stenographer&#x27;s pads discovered at his house; he refused to cooperate and was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court.)

==Dental identifications==
Initially, Berdella was formally charged with one count of felonious restraint, one count of assault, and seven counts of forcible sodomy, as investigators continued their investigations into the discoveries at his property. He was assigned a temporary public defender as his legal representative, and held in protective custody in a Jackson County jail in lieu of $500,000 bail (the equivalent of approximately $1,333,400 ).

In late April, the skull found inside Berdella&#x27;s closet was identified via dental X-rays obtained via subpoena from the University of Kansas Medical Center as that of Robert Sheldon. The same day a dental identification was made upon Sheldon&#x27;s skull, two men separately phoned the Kansas City Police Department to state one of seven unidentified young men depicted in a photographic array released to the media on April 27 was a former high school acquaintance of theirs named Mark Wallace. When a detective contacted Wallace&#x27;s sister, she stated her brother had been missing since mid-1985. Shortly thereafter, investigators discovered that photograph &quot;D&quot; released to the media in this same array was one Larry Wayne Pearson. As Pearson had once been a ward of the court in Wichita, his dental records were available to be compared with the skull found in Berdella&#x27;s backyard.

Berdella would be formally charged with the murder by dismemberment of Larry Wayne Pearson in July after the head discovered in his backyard was formally identified as Pearson&#x27;s on May 12. Prosecutors had gathered sufficient circumstantial evidence to accompany the physical evidence retrieved.

==First indictments==
On July 22, 1988, a grand jury formally indicted Berdella for the murder of Larry Wayne Pearson. The following month, he was arraigned and pleaded guilty in the 4th Circuit of the Jackson County Court before Judge Alvin C. Randall to the first-degree murder of Larry Pearson. The plea was entered following a late-morning recess in the arraignment hearing into this particular murder, and came as a surprise to both the judge, and prosecuting attorneys. The prosecution team assigned to the case accepted the plea, with assistant prosecutor Pat Hall later explaining this decision as being &quot;in the best interest of our client, the people of the state of Missouri&quot;.

Following the submission and acceptance of this plea, the judge insisted that Berdella confess under oath as to Pearson&#x27;s death. In response to questioning by his attorneys, Berdella stated: &quot;I put a plastic bag over his head, and tied it with rope and allowed him to suffocate.&quot; When asked if he performed this act deliberately, and with malice aforethought, Berdella simply stated, &quot;Yes.&quot; He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Upon being sentenced, Berdella was transferred to the Missouri State Penitentiary to commence his life sentence. He would later be temporarily placed in protective custody at the Potosi Correctional Center, due to concerns for his safety.

A second guilty plea submitted before the Jackson County Court on August 24 earned Berdella a further life term without parole for one charge of forcible sodomy against Christopher Bryson (six counts of sodomy and one charge of assault being dropped as part of a plea bargain); he would also receive a further term of seven years pertaining to one count of felonious restraint against Bryson on this date.

===Plea bargain===
Despite initially pleading not guilty to the remaining five murder charges on September 13, 1988, with the agreement of his two defense attorneys, Berdella ultimately conducted a plea bargain with the prosecutors in order to avoid the death penalty in these remaining charges. In this plea bargain, Berdella agreed to confess in graphic detail as to whom he had killed, what indignities he had inflicted on each victim, how he had killed each victim, and what he had done with their bodies. These confessions were given to prosecutors between December 13 and 15, 1988. In return for his cooperation, the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty at a formal hearing scheduled for 9a.m. on December 19.

On December 19, 1988, Berdella formally waived his rights to be tried for any of the outstanding murder charges, upon the understanding he was to be convicted of one further count of first-degree murder (that of Robert Sheldon), and four counts of second-degree murder. He formally pleaded guilty to each of these charges before Judge Robert Meyers in the Jackson County Circuit Court. Members of the public were prohibited from attending this hearing, with only family members of his victims and news reporters permitted access to the proceedings. In response to these guilty pleas, Judge Meyers imposed five further concurrent life sentences, with an additional condition barring any future prospect of parole in the sole case of first-degree murder to which Berdella pleaded guilty.

==Confessions==
Berdella provided testimony to prosecutors between December 13 and 15, after he changed his plea and sought approval of their agreement not to seek the death penalty against him if he fully confessed. In this testimony, Berdella claimed the movie he had first seen in 1965, &quot;The Collector&quot;, had left a major impression on him. Following the senses of shock and disgust he claimed to have initially experienced after killing his first victim, the movie had resurfaced in his memory and subsequently became a motivating psychological force in the actions he exhibited against his victims in his subsequent murders. His victims, he stated to investigators, had lost any degree of humanity in his eyes once he had chosen to render them captive.

Berdella confessed that many of the abbreviated entries within his torture logs were simply shorthand terms for methods of abuse he had inflicted upon his victims, whereas others would describe either their reactions to these ongoing acts of abuse and torture, or his initial observations upon viewing them when he entered the room where he had kept them restrained. The entry reading &quot;CP&quot;, for example, referred to the chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading &quot;DC&quot; referred to swabbing their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords.

Entries reading &quot;EK&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot; referred to torture administered to his captives with electrical shocks, whereas several other entries contained the anatomical location where Berdella administered the abuse or torture to his victims. For example, at one point in relation to victim James Ferris, Berdella had written an entry reading: &quot;2 1/2 ket nk + shoulder&quot; to indicate he had injected 2.2 cubic centimeters of ketamine into his victim&#x27;s neck and shoulder. Other entries such as &quot;gag loose, no resist in retie&quot; or &quot;very delayed breathing, snoring&quot; were more self-explanatory. Investigators consulted a specialist in toxicology in their investigation into Berdella following his arrest who stated that, judging by the notes he had written about victim Robert Sheldon, the accumulation of chlorpromazine injected into this victim had been toxic.

Furthermore, Berdella confessed to having alternately buried the two victims&#x27; heads in his backyard, adding that he retrieved and cleaned the first skullthat of Robert Sheldonat the time he buried victim Larry Pearson&#x27;s head in the same hole. Sheldon&#x27;s skull was that which he placed inside a closet on the second floor of his property, in an area of the household Berdella referred to as &quot;my gallery area&quot;, he removed the teeth from this skull and kept them stowed inside envelopes. He further claimed to have intended to retrieve Pearson&#x27;s skull once sufficient time had elapsed for it to skeletonize, although he was adamant there had been no rational or sinister reason for his doing so. In addition, he vehemently denied media rumors that he had been engaged in any form of satanism, or that he had sold sections of his victims&#x27; bodies at his flea market booth.

Berdella was able to name all of his victims to investigators. Although one victim (Mark Wallace) had been seized by opportunity when Berdella had found him seeking shelter from a severe thunderstorm in his tool shed, his other five victims had been captured after he had unsuccessfully tried to steer them away from their general lifestyles, and had thus simply become frustrated at the failure of his efforts. Regarding each victim&#x27;s captivity, Berdella described in graphic detail the sexual, physical, and emotional abuse to which he had subjected each victim, and which he had recorded within his torture logs. He tersely explained his successive actions to investigators on December 14 with the statement that he was &quot;capturing them first, and what developed, developed.&quot; Nonetheless, he did claim that he had tried to prevent any of his victims from developing any form of malnutrition or infection by occasionally administering antibiotics, or nutrients intravenously as his abuse and torture escalated.

The methods of torture exhibited against his victims had included the administration of high-voltage electrical shocks, starvation, the application of alkali-based detergents to their throats, vocal cords, or eyes, and the bludgeoning of their hands with the intention of rendering these body parts unusable. One other method of torture was the insertion of needles beneath their fingernails. Furthermore, Berdella confessed that the level of abuse he inflicted had increased with each successive victim, and he had viewed the Polaroid images he had taken of his victims as being a &quot;trophy or record of the event&quot;.

Although police extensively searched for the remains of Berdella&#x27;s victims throughout their initial investigation into his crimes, the confession he provided to investigators in the autumn of 1988 confirmed that the dismembered bodies of all six of his victims had been stowed in trash bags and taken to unknown landfill sites. Their bodies were never recovered.
==Incarceration==
In the years following his 1988 convictions and incarceration, Berdella granted an interview to the Missouri-based television station &quot;KCPT&quot;, and corresponded with numerous individuals. To all concerned, he attempted to restore his image as a &quot;sensitive citizen&quot; who had simply &quot;made mistakes&quot; in committing his crimes. He further claimed he had been demonized unfairly by the media before, during, and after his arraignments and plea bargains, and that police ineptitude had resulted in his being allowed to remain at liberty following his first murder.

Berdella also lodged several complaints with prison officials regarding prison conditions. He also wrote several letters to a local minister claiming that prison officials knew of his high blood pressure, yet were not providing him with his prescribed heart medication.

==Death==
In 1992, Berdella contacted Rev. Roger Coleman, whom he had met when first incarcerated, relaying his distress that the staff at the Missouri State Penitentiary were withholding his heart medication. At 2:00 p.m. on October 8, 1992, Berdella complained to prison staff of severe heart pains, and was taken from his cell to the prison infirmary. Medical staff determined his heart was unstable and called an ambulance. Berdella was taken to a hospital in Columbia, Missouri, where he was pronounced dead from a heart attack at 3:55 p.m. He was 43 years old.

Shortly after, the judge at his trial, Alvin Randall, was informed of Berdella&#x27;s death. In response, Randall sarcastically remarked: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t have happened to a nicer guy.&quot;

According to published reports, although Berdella had a depressive personality disorder, he was also a diagnosed sexual sadist who gained extreme sexual excitation from the humiliation, pain, and torture to which he had subjected his victims. Moreover, despite his claims to journalists whom he had contacted in the years of his incarceration, Berdella never expressed any degree of remorse for his actions and tersely referred to his victims as &quot;play toys&quot; in an interview he granted shortly before his death.

==Aftermath==
In November 1988, auctions of Berdella&#x27;s vast collection of artifacts and furniture confiscated from his home and business were held on four separate dates, with the intention that all proceeds raised at the auctions to be used to pay his mounting legal fees within then-ongoing legal proceedings. The auction attracted considerable national interest, receiving telephone bids from across the United States. Although many items sold for less than the expected price, by the end of the first day&#x27;s auctioneering alone, more than $60,000 had been raised (equivalent to $160,000 ).

Berdella&#x27;s house was purchased by a local businessman for an undisclosed sum in December 1988. The property was later demolished.

==Victims==
By the time of Berdella&#x27;s arrest, he had abducted, tortured, and murdered at least six young men (he was initially suspected of involvement in two other disappearances). Although more than twenty different men were depicted in postures suggesting unconsciousness or death within the 334 Polaroid images and thirty-four snapshot prints seized from 4315 Charlotte Street following his arrest, Berdella was adamant that the six men identified as victims and whom he had confessed to killing were the only ones that he murdered.

*Jerry Howell, 19, July 5, 1984: An acquaintance of Berdella who died of asphyxiation after approximately 28hours of captivity, which included repeated sexual assaults. Howell had known Berdella since 1979.
*Robert Sheldon, 20, April 12, 1985: Sheldon had lodged with Berdella on April 10, two days prior to his &quot;formulating the intent&quot; to keep him captive on April12. He was killed by suffocation on April15. His head was initially buried in Berdella&#x27;s garden. Later, his skull was retrieved and stowed in Berdella&#x27;s bedroom closet.
*Mark Wallace, 27, June 22, 1985: Discovered by chance hiding from a thunderstorm in Berdella&#x27;s tool shed. Wallace died of a combination of a lack of oxygen and injected drugs at 7p.m. on June23.
*James Ferris, 25, September 26, 1985: The first victim whom Berdella stated he had intentionally tortured prior to his death. Berdella noted that Ferris became delirious during his captivity as a result of the torture he had exhibited and the medication he had administered to him, with one of the final notations in his log of Ferris&#x27;s capture being, &quot;unable to sit up more than 10-15 [seconds]&quot;. His death was noted in Berdella&#x27;s torture log with the notation &quot;Stop the project&quot;.
*Todd Stoops, 23, June 17, 1986: Kidnapped due to Berdella being &quot;sexually frustrated&quot; with him. The torture he endured prior to his death included electric shocks via a spatula placed across his eyelid in an unsuccessful attempt to blind him. Stoops died of a combination of blood loss and infection on July1.
*Larry Wayne Pearson, 20, June 23, 1987: Held captive until August5. Pearson was killed by suffocation after six weeks of captivity, which included having a piano wire tied around his wrists with the intention of causing nerve damage. His head was kept and buried in Berdella&#x27;s garden.

<doc id="973438" wikidata="Q725335" url="?curid=973438" title="Japanese cruiser Ashigara">
<text>was the final vessel of the four-member of heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which were active in World War II. The other ships of the class were , , and . &quot;Ashigara&quot; was named after Mount Ashigara on the border of Kanagawa and Shizuoka Prefectures.

==Background==
&quot;Ashigara&quot; was approved under the 1922 Fleet Modernization Program as one of the first heavy cruisers to be built by Japan within the design constraints imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, and was one of the first of the &quot;10,000 ton&quot; cruisers built by any nation. Naval architect Vice admiral Yuzuru Hiraga was able to keep the design from becoming dangerously top-heavy in its early years by continually rejecting demands from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff for additional equipment to the upper decks. However, during modifications and rebuildings in the 1930s, the final displacement rose to 15,933 tons, well over the treaty limits.

==Design==

The &quot;Myōkō&quot; class displaced , with a hull design based on an enlarged version of the . &quot;Ashigara&quot; was long, with a beam of , draft of and were capable of .
Propulsion was by 12 Kampon boilers driving four sets of single-impulse geared turbine engines, with four shafts turning three-bladed propellers. The ship was armored with a 102 mm side belt, and 35 mm armored deck; however, the bridge was not armored.

&quot;Ashigara&quot;’s main battery was ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, the heaviest armament of any heavy cruiser in the world at the time, mounted in five twin turrets. Her secondary armament included eight 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns in four twin mounts on each side, and 12 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes in four triple launchers positioned below the aircraft deck. &quot;Ashigara&quot; was also equipped with an aircraft catapult and carried up to three floatplanes for scouting purposes.

&quot;Ashigara&quot; was laid down at the Kawasaki Shipyards in Kobe on 11 April 1925, launched and named on 22 April 1928, and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 20 August 1929.

&quot;Ashigara&quot; was repeatedly modernized and upgraded throughout her career in order to counter the growing threat of air strikes.

==Operational history==

===Early service===
All of the &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class cruisers were assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, forming &quot;Sentai&quot;-4 of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and trained as a unit during the 1930s. &quot;Ashigara&quot; was flagship of the unit under Vice Admiral Nobutarō Iida from 30 November 1929.
During a naval review off Kobe on 26 October 1930 stack gases caused problems on the bridge, resulting in a lengthening of the forward smokestack by two meters.

During the First Shanghai Incident of February 1932, the cruisers escorted the transports conveying elements of the Imperial Japanese Army to the continent. In December 1932, the cruisers were placed in reserve as the new was commissioned, becoming the new &quot;Sentai&quot;-4, whereas the &quot;Myōkō&quot; class was shifted to &quot;Sentai&quot;-5. Between 1933 and 1935, all &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class cruisers were retrofitted with their fixed triple torpedo launchers replaced by two quadruple rotatable launchers, and their secondary guns upgraded from 12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval guns to 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun. During 1935 summer training off of Muroran, Hokkaido, a flashback during a gunnery exercise destroyed her No.2 turret, killing 41 crewmen. Repairs were completed by December.

On 10 March 1937, &quot;Ashigara&quot; was assigned detached duty for a diplomatic mission to Europe for the coronation of King George VI. She departed Yokosuka, Kanagawa on 3 April, and called on Singapore, Aden, the Suez Canal and Malta on her way to Portsmouth, arriving 10 May. Following the 20 May naval review, &quot;Ashigara&quot; called on Kiel, Germany and the majority of the crew was allowed to visit Berlin, where the senior staff was received by Adolf Hitler on 24 May. On 31 May, &quot;Ashigara&quot; participated in the German Kriegsmarine Day naval review, celebrating the German World War I &quot;victory&quot; at the Battle of Jutland. She then returned to Japan via Gibraltar, Port Said (Egypt), and Colombo (Ceylon).

During the Second Sino-Japanese War &quot;Ashigara&quot; was designated flagship of &quot;Sentai&quot;-5 on 5 July 1937. She led the convoy with the Imperial Japanese Army Expeditionary Army Headquarters to China on 21 August.

===SS &quot;President Hoover&quot;===
In the early hours of 11 December 1937 the ocean liner en route from Kobe to Manila ran aground in a typhoon on Kasho-to off Taiwan, and 14 hours later &quot;Ashigara&quot; and a arrived to assist. The two warships stood by as &quot;Hoover&quot;″s 330 crew got all 503 passengers and themselves ashore.

On 12 December the s and arrived and &quot;Ashigara&quot; cleared them to enter Japanese territorial waters. On 13 December the liner SS &quot;President McKinley&quot; arrived to repatriate about 630 survivors, and on 14 December, &quot;Ashigara&quot; and her destroyer escort provided flat-bottomed boats to ferry them from the beach to a motor launch and lifeboats that took them out to the liner. On 15 December the liner SS &quot;President Pierce&quot; evacuated the last 200 survivors, and &quot;Alden&quot; was allowed to remain to guard &quot;Hoover&quot;″s wreck until Japanese authorities relieved her on 23 December.

===Pre-war===
Captain Kuninori Marumo assumed command of &quot;Ashigara&quot; from 15 December 1937, followed by Captain Marquis Tadashige Daigo from 3 June until 1 December. &quot;Ashigara&quot;’s second reconstruction was completed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 15 February 1939. She was commanded by Captain Michiaki Kamada from December 1938 to October 1940.
&quot;Ashigara&quot; participated in the occupation of Cochin China, arriving in Saigon on 29 July 1941. She returned to Sasebo in August and was appointed flagship for Vice Admiral Ibō Takahashi’s &quot;Sentai&quot;-16 on 2 December.

===Second World War===
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Ashigara&quot; deployed out of Mako Guard District in the Pescadores with the cruisers and to support Japanese forces in the invasion of northern Luzon. On 10 December, she was attacked by nine PBY Catalina bombers, which failed to score a hit. She was again unsuccessfully attacked by five USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers the following day. She continued to support Japanese landing operations in the Philippines, as well as Balikpapan and Makassar in the Dutch East Indies through February 1942.
On 10 December &quot;Ashigara&quot; was in a holding position in the South China Sea about northwest of Manila Bay, with the heavy cruiser &quot;Maya&quot;, light cruiser &quot;Kuma&quot;, and destroyers &quot;Ikazuchi&quot; and &quot;Inazuma&quot;. Admiral Takahashi commanded the Philippine Invasion Force. His position was discovered by U. S. Navy air patrols from Luzon. PBY-4 #17 from VP 102, Patrol Wing TEN, flying an assigned sector, located the ships, and the contact report resulted in a strike. Five of the wing&#x27;s PBY-4s, flying from NAS Sangley Point on Manila Bay, commanded by Lieutenant Commander J. V. Peterson, USN, attacked at noon time, dropping twenty 500 lb demolition bombs in a tight pattern from 13,500 feet. The splashes were clustered about close astern of the cruiser and at the time it was thought at least two bombs hit their target, which turned in a tight circle and appeared to be maneuvering with difficulty. No one observed any fire or smoke from the target ship. Flak was heavy, but only one PBY sustained minor damage. The two heavy cruisers were identified as battleships, the target ship thought to be &quot;Kongo&quot;, but this was officially downgraded to cruisers in subsequent reports. Two follow-up strikes by PBY-4s in the following hours failed to find the ships.

During the aftermath of the Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March 1942, &quot;Ashigara&quot; joined the rest of her class in tracking down the severely damaged heavy cruiser and her two destroyers. During the engagement, &quot;Ashigara&quot; combined fire with her sistership &quot;Myōkō&quot; to sink the destroyer , while her sisterships &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; finished off &quot;Exeter&quot;.

On 10 March 1942, she became flagship for the Second Southern Expeditionary Fleet, and led the invasion of Christmas Island on 26 May 1942. She became flagship of the Southwest Area Fleet from 10 April 1942, and returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for a refit and repairs in June. She returned to Makassar in July to resume her position as flagship of the Second Southern Expeditionary Fleet, but for the rest of the year was primarily engaged as a rapid troop transport based out of Surabaya. She was dry-docked and repaired at Seletar Naval Base in Singapore at the end of the year.

In 1943 and early 1944, &quot;Ashigara&quot; performed guard and troop transport duties and saw no action. She returned to Yokosuka for a month in April, and a Type 21 radar was installed. In February 1944, she was reassigned to the IJN 5th Fleet for operations in northern waters. A Type 22 surface-search radar was installed in March, and she was based out of the Ōminato Guard District, together with the cruiser until the end of July. She was refitted at Kure Naval Arsenal in September, with additional Type 96 AA guns installed.

In the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 24 October 1944, &quot;Ashigara&quot;, with Captain Hayao Miura in command, was assigned to Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima&#x27;s, force along with &quot;Nachi&quot; and eight destroyers. This force entered Surigao Strait on 25 October after Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s First Raiding Force had been destroyed. Following the loss of the battleships and Nishimura&#x27;s and their escorts at the hands of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf&#x27;s fleet and aircraft, with Nishimura being killed aboard &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, &quot;Ashigara&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; fired their torpedoes and retreated (&quot;Nachi&quot; with damage from a collision with ). &quot;Ashigara&quot; escaped to Palawan and from there to Brunei. She departed Brunei on 17 November with the battleship and cruiser , and on arriving in the Spratly Islands the following day became the flagship of Vice Admiral Shima. On 20 November, she departed the Spratly Islands, arriving at Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina on 14 December, where Admiral Shima transferred his flag to . &quot;Ashigara&quot; and &quot; Ōyodo &quot; and the destroyers , , , , , and were assigned to join the Raiding Force on the American beachhead in Mindoro in the Philippines. While approaching Mindoro, the Raiding Force was attacked by B-25 Mitchell bombers. &quot;Ashigara&quot; was damaged by a direct hit by a 500-lb bomb, but was still able to complete her mission, bombarding the American positions with over 200 shells and returning to Cam Ranh Bay on 29 December.

====Fate====

On 26 January 1945, &quot;Ashigara&quot; was dry-docked in Singapore to repair bomb damage. On 5 February, she was transferred to the control of the 10th Area Fleet and spent the next five months transporting troops and supplies in the Dutch East Indies and the Bay of Bengal. On 22 April, she was attacked by the Royal Dutch Navy submarine , which fired four torpedoes, all of which missed.

On 7 June 1945, &quot;Ashigara&quot; departed Batavia (present-day Jakarta) for Singapore with 1,600 troops on board, escorted by the destroyer . The United States Navy submarine USS &quot;Blueback&quot; reported their departure, but was unable to maneuver into an attack position. &quot;Blueback&quot;&#x27;s contact report was received by the Royal Navy submarines and , which lay in wait at the northern end of Bangka Strait, between Sumatra and Bangka Island. On the morning of 8 June 1945, &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and &quot;Trenchant&quot; spotted each other and exchanged fire, but both then lost contact with each other. While &quot;Kamikaze&quot; continued north and became entangled in combat with &quot;Stygian&quot;, &quot;Trenchant&quot; submerged, spotted &quot;Ashigara&quot; heading north at 1148, then made a difficult torpedo attack from a poor firing position abaft the cruiser&#x27;s starboard beam, firing eight torpedoes from her bow tubes at 1212. Trapped between the Sumatran shore to port and a shoal to starboard, &quot;Ashigara&quot; nevertheless attempted to turn starboard to comb the torpedo tracks, but was unable to complete the maneuver in time and was hit five times at a range of . &quot;Trenchant&quot; then fired two more torpedoes from her stern tubes, which missed, but &quot;Ashigara&quot; was already fatally damaged and sank at 1239 at .

&quot;Kamikaze&quot;, having also lost contact with &quot;Stygian&quot;, turned back south too late to intercept &quot;Trenchant&quot;, which made her escape submerged. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and two local vessels rescued 400 Japanese Army troops and 853 crewmen, including her captain, Rear Admiral Miura; however, over 1200 troops and 100 crewmen went down with the ship. &quot;Ashigara&quot; was struck from the IJN Navy List on 20 August 1945.

<text>Swisstopo is the official name for the Swiss Federal Office of Topography, Switzerland&#x27;s national mapping agency.

The current name was made official in 2002. It had been used as the domain name for the homepage of the institute, swisstopo.admin.ch, since 1997.

==Maps==
The main class of products produced by Swisstopo are topographical maps on seven different scales. Swiss maps have been praised for their accuracy and quality.

===Regular maps===
* 1:25.000. This is the most detailed map, useful for many purposes. Those are popular with tourists, especially for famous areas like Zermatt and St. Moritz. These maps cost CHF 13.50 each (2004). 208 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. The first map published on this scale was &quot;1125 Chasseral&quot;, in 1952. The last map published on this scale was &quot;1292 Maggia&quot;, in 1972. Since 1956, composites have been published, starting with &quot;2501 St. Gallen&quot;. They have the same information, but consist of several parts of regular maps combined, especially in tourist or urban areas. 22 composite maps have so far (September 2004) been published.
* 1:50.000. Since 1994, routes are coloured on these maps. It is marketed as &quot;for hikers, alpinists, cyclists, planners, tourists and explorers&quot;. 78 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. Composites also exist, and are more frequent than the assemblages for 1:25.000 maps. As of September 2004, 24 composite maps have been published.
* 1:100.000. These are marketed as &quot;Geographical regions of special interest to tourists on one map&quot;. 24 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. 11 composite maps have also been published.
* 1:200.000. Switzerland and surrounding lands in four sheets (no composite maps).
* 1:300.000. A photographic copy of the 1:200.000 map, with Switzerland on a single sheet.
* 1:500.000. Switzerland with surrounding lands.
* 1:1.000.000. Switzerland with extensive surroundings, from Luxembourg to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

====Numbering system====
The numbering system of Swiss regular maps (apart from composites) is directly based on the geographical situation. A map number is always one higher than the map number of the adjacent map to the west, and one lower than the adjacent map to the east. From north to south, the numbers differ by 20 for the scale 1:25.000, 10 for the scale 1:50.000 and 5 for the scale 1:100.000. However, as can be seen on the &quot;Seite nicht gefunden&quot;, there are some exceptions to this rule: Switzerland is a little bit too large to be only 20 1:25.000 maps wide. Instead of choosing another system, the map to the east of &quot;1199 Scuol&quot; is called &quot;1199bis Piz Lad&quot;. The same is true for some maps at scale 1:50.000.

===Tourist maps===
* Hiking maps are published on the scale 1:50.000. They are based on the regular maps 1:50.000, but include information about which routes are good to walk. They also have information about public transport. These maps are published in collaboration with &quot;Swisshiking&quot;.
* Ski tour map, 1:50.000. Based on the topographical map 1:50.000, but including information about steep slopes, ski routes and snowboard routes.
* Road map: two sheets published on a scale of 1:200.000, but not the same as the topographical 1:200.000, as it lacks contour lines. This map is published each year.
* Cultural Heritage, 1:300.000
* Map of Museums, 1:300.000.
* Map of Castles, 1:200.000. It is based on the topographical map 1:200.000, but includes information about castles, fortresses and ruins.
* Everest, in collaboration with a lot of other organizations, including the National Geographic Society.
* The &quot;Swiss Path&quot; is a hiking trail around Lake Uri to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Swiss Confederation. 
* Seeland-Trois lacs, 1:75.000, not directly based on any topographical map (e.g. it lacks contour lines). It was made for the &quot;Expo. 02&quot; which was in this region.

===Other maps===
* Satellite map, 1:300.000.
* Community map, 1:300.000, with only political borders, no topographical information except for lakes.
* Einst und Jetzt (history map; 1:25.000): only Bern and Basel have been published so far.
* Land use map, 1:300.000, with statistical information only (no topographical information)
* Aeronautical map, 1:500.000, based on the topographical map 1:500.000, with aviation information.
* Glider chart (1:300.000)
* Chart of Air Navigation Obstacles (1:100.000)
* Solar Radiation

== History ==
=== Early work and Dufourkarten ===
In 1809, the first topographical surveys of Switzerland took place on a confederate, military level. They took place in the north-eastern area and were led by Hans Conrad Finsler. Measurements in the alpine region started in 1825 with triangulations by Antoine-Joseph Buchwalder. This work would be finished in 1837 by Johannes Eschmann. At New Year 1838, the Topographical Bureau (&quot;Eidgenössisches Topographisches Bureau&quot;) was founded in Carouge, Geneve by Guillaume Henri Dufour. This bureau published its first map the same year, the &quot;Carte topographique du Canton de Genève&quot;. Topographic surveys also started in the alpine regions of Switzerland. These had their first results in 1845, a year later than planned, when a map scaled 1:100.000 was published. This was the start of what are termed &quot;Dufourkarten&quot; (&quot;Dufour&#x27;s Maps&quot;). The topographic survey finished in 1862. To honour Dufour, the Swiss government decided to rename the highest peak on the &quot;Dufourkarten&quot; from &quot;Höchste Spitze&quot; to Dufourspitze: it still carries that name today. In 1863, the SAC published a 1:50.000 map of the region Tödi, based on unpublished survey material. A year later, the last map of the &quot;Dufourkarten&quot; was published, and the following year, Dufour retired and Hermann Siegfried became Chief of the Topographical Bureau.

=== Siegfriedkarten ===
In 1865, Herman Siegfried becomes the Chief of the Topographical Bureau, and the bureau moves from Geneva to Bern. Over the next few years, a composite map is published of Ticino, soundings start to measure the depth of the major Swiss lakes, and a first map is published scaled 1:250.000. In 1868, a Federal Act is passed to enforce the continuation of the initial topographic surveys, as well as the publication of the results. This results in new topographical surveys in 1869 and the publication of the first 13 &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot; (1:25.000 and 1:50.000) in 1870. In 1878, a 1:1.000.000 map is published, and the next year, the height of the Pierre du Niton is measured to be 376.86 metre. In 1880, Herman Siegfried is succeeded by Jules Dumur.

In 1895, the Topographical surveys for the &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot; are finished. As of 1901, 581 sheets of the &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot; have been published, with only a few individual more maps to come (there would be 604 maps in 1926). On old maps of the modern series, a reference to those maps can still be found: until the 1970s, the &quot;Siegfriedkarte&quot; was the best scale available for some areas of Switzerland, and therefore used by climbers and other alpinists. The printing of the &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot; would continue until 1952.

=== New century ===
In 1887, the first maps with relief shading are published. In 1889, a photographic studio is appended to the bureau. In the years after 1894, a wall-map for schools is published, in response to a request from the parliament to do so. In 1898, the soundings of the major Swiss lakes are finished. In 1901, the bureau is moved into an independent division within the military, and the name &quot;Eidgenössische Landestopographie&quot; becomes customary, a name still used by some people until today, and a name which can be found on some older maps. Hermann Kümmerly publishes a relief wall-map for schools in the same year. In 1908, map trials are started to serve as a replacement for the &quot;Dufourkarten&quot;. Two years later, trials start to replace the &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot;. Much of this military work would remain secret for many years. In 1913, 1922 and 1924, trials are done with aerial photogrammetry, first with balloons and later with aircraft, but only as of 1930 this is used for production of maps, and in 1940 terrestrial photogrammetry is abandoned.

=== Modern maps ===
On 21 June 1935, a Federal Act was passed on the production of the new National Map series, ranging in scale from 1:25.000 to 1:1.000.000. Because of the political situation in Europe, work was started on the 1:50.000 maps. For this purpose, a &#x27;M18d&#x27; Messerschmitt was bought for aerial photography, the first aircraft owned by the &quot;Eidgenössischie Landestopographie&quot;. In 1938, the first 1:50.000 map was published: &quot;263 Wildstrubel&quot;. From 1939 to 1945, all sales were suspended because of World War II. In 1939, the &quot;Eidgenössische Landestopographie&quot; also procured its first vehicle.

The first 1:25:000 map, &quot;1145 Bielersee&quot;, was published in 1952. The last 1:25.000 map, &quot;1292 Maggia&quot;, was published in 1979. This marked the finish of the lowest-scale mapping of Switzerland. The first composite in this scale, &quot;2501 St. Gallen&quot;, was published in 1956.

The 1:50.000 series was completed in 1963 with &quot;285 Domodossola&quot;. With the publication of this map, the &quot;Siegfriedkarten&quot; have been entirely replaced. The first composite on this scale, &quot;5001 Gotthard&quot;, was published in 1954.

The 1:100.000 series started with &quot;41 Col du Pillon&quot; (1954), and finished with &quot;47 Monte Rosa&quot; in 1965. With this publication, the &quot;Dufourkarten&quot; have been entirely replaced.

The 1:200.000 series started with No. 3 in 1971 and finished with No. 4 in 1976.

The maps on the scales 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 were respectively first published in 1965 and 1994. With the publication of the latter map, the work required by the Federal Act of 1935 was finally finished.

Since 1951, different sorts of leisure maps have been published by the Federal Office of Topography. See above for a list of those.

In 1958, the coordinate system of the maps was changed. Before 1958, the centre of the coordinate system, Bern, had coordinates (0, 0). Subsequently, it has coordinates (600, 200). This was done so that any coordinate is either an x-coordinate or a y-coordinate: this prevents confusion about the order of the coordinates.

In 1968, the name officially became &quot;Eidgenössische Landestopographie&quot; instead of &quot;Abteilung für Landestopographie&quot;, although this had been common practice for decades. The English name remained unchanged (&quot;Topographical Survey of Switzerland&quot;).

In 1979, the &quot;Eidgenössische Landestopographie&quot; was renamed to the current name &quot;Bundesamt für Landestopographie&quot;. See above for the names in other languages. Since 2002, the international name &quot;Swisstopo&quot; has been used. This name had already been used since the website went online in 1997.

== Peculiarities ==

Some maps produced by Swisstopo scarcely have any Switzerland on it. This is especially true for the scales 1:100.000 and 1:50.000. As can be seen here, the map &quot;45 Haute Savoie&quot; only has a very little spot of Switzerland on it, in the extreme north-western corner. The same is true for the 1:50.000 map 285 Domodossola. In both cases, no 1:25.000 maps have been published for the corresponding part of the 1:50.000 map: at the 1:25.000 scale, some maps are a tiny bit larger than others, to be able to get all of Switzerland onto a map without the need of maps with less than 0.1% domestic territory on it.

Initially, the plan was to be more generous also for 1:25.000 maps. Thirty-one maps were once planned, most of which did not have a single km^2 Switzerland on it, that were never published. Some of them (&quot;1158 Zeinisjoch&quot;) were up to ten kilometers away from the Swiss border. On old Swiss maps, one can still see the &quot;Blattübersicht&quot; were those are signified as &quot;planned maps&quot;.

Some maps have been published in the past, but have been discontinued, also because they lack any part of Switzerland. &quot;1035 Friedrichshafen&quot; is an example of that. When one looks at the Mapsheet Index Northeast, there is no map to the east or to the north of &quot;1055 Romanshorn&quot;. However, when one then looks at the area of &quot;1055 Romanshorn&quot;, it can be seen that these maps do in fact exist, but do not have any Swiss land on the map.

<text>Mix Megapol is a private Swedish radio network controlled by Bauer Media Group. It launched in 1993 under the name Skärgårdsradion (Archipelago Radio). Later that year the name was changed to Radio Megapol when the broadcasting permissions were auctioned out. In 1997 the word &quot;Mix&quot; was added and their slogan became &quot;The best mix of hits and oldies&quot;. Mix Megapol is on air in 24 cities from Kiruna in the north to Malmö in the south. They have over two million listeners per week. Their target group is people aged between 25 and 45.

<text>The Trusted Email Open Standard (TEOS) is an anti-spam technique proposed by the ePrivacy Group in 2003 at the Federal Trade Commission Anti-Spam Summit.

Edited by Stephen Cobb, CISSP, the 35-page white paper describing the standard was downloaded more than 30,000 times between publication in April 2003 and the end of that year. Many elements of TEOS later appeared in the letter that Microsoft CEO Bill Gates submitted to U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearings on anti-spam legislation. The letter outlined Microsoft&#x27;s position on how the spam crisis should be handled.

At its most basic level, TEOS proposes a framework of trusted identity for email senders based on secure, fast, lightweight signatures in email headers, optimized with DNS-based systems for flexibility and ease of implementation. TEOS also provides a common-language framework for making trusted assertions about the content of each individual message. ISPs and email recipients can rely on these assertions to manage their email.

<doc id="973479" wikidata="Q1644451" url="?curid=973479" title="Pseudo-differential operator">
<text>In mathematical analysis a pseudo-differential operator is an extension of the concept of differential operator. Pseudo-differential operators are used extensively in the theory of partial differential equations and quantum field theory, e.g. in mathematical models that include ultrametric pseudo-differential equations in a non-Archimedean space.

==History==
The study of pseudo-differential operators began in the mid 1960s with the work of Kohn, Nirenberg, Hörmander, Unterberger and Bokobza.

They played an influential role in the second proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem via K-theory. Atiyah and Singer thanked Hörmander for assistance with understanding the theory of pseudo-differential operators.

==Motivation==

===Linear differential operators with constant coefficients===
Consider a linear differential operator with constant coefficients,

:formula_1

which acts on smooth functions formula_2 with compact support in R&quot;n&quot;.
This operator can be written as a composition of a Fourier transform, a simple &quot;multiplication&quot; by the
polynomial function (called the symbol)

:formula_3

and an inverse Fourier transform, in the form:

Here, formula_4 is a multi-index, formula_5 are complex numbers, and

:formula_6

is an iterated partial derivative, where ∂&quot;j&quot; means differentiation with respect to the &quot;j&quot;-th variable. We introduce the constants formula_7 to facilitate the calculation of Fourier transforms.

;Derivation of formula ()
The Fourier transform of a smooth function &quot;u&quot;, compactly supported in R&quot;n&quot;, is

:formula_8

and Fourier&#x27;s inversion formula gives

:formula_9

By applying &quot;P&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) to this representation of &quot;u&quot; and using

:formula_10

one obtains formula ().

===Representation of solutions to partial differential equations===

To solve the partial differential equation

:formula_11

we (formally) apply the Fourier transform on both sides and obtain the &quot;algebraic&quot; equation

:formula_12

If the symbol &quot;P&quot;(ξ) is never zero when ξ ∈ R&quot;n&quot;, then it is possible to divide by &quot;P&quot;(ξ):

:formula_13

By Fourier&#x27;s inversion formula, a solution is

:formula_14

Here it is assumed that:
# &quot;P&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is a linear differential operator with &quot;constant&quot; coefficients,
# its symbol &quot;P&quot;(ξ) is never zero,
# both &quot;u&quot; and ƒ have a well defined Fourier transform.
The last assumption can be weakened by using the theory of distributions.
The first two assumptions can be weakened as follows.

In the last formula, write out the Fourier transform of ƒ to obtain

:formula_15

This is similar to formula (), except that 1/&quot;P&quot;(ξ) is not a polynomial function, but a function of a more general kind.

==Definition of pseudo-differential operators==

Here we view pseudo-differential operators as a generalization of differential operators.
We extend formula (1) as follows. A pseudo-differential operator &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;D&quot;) on R&quot;n&quot; is an operator whose value on the function &quot;u(x)&quot; is the function of &quot;x&quot;:

where formula_16 is the Fourier transform of &quot;u&quot; and the symbol &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,ξ) in the integrand belongs to a certain &quot;symbol class&quot;.
For instance, if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,ξ) is an infinitely differentiable function on R&quot;n&quot; × R&quot;n&quot; with the property

:formula_17

for all &quot;x&quot;,ξ ∈R&quot;n&quot;, all multiindices α,β, some constants &quot;C&quot;α, β and some real number &quot;m&quot;, then &quot;P&quot; belongs to the symbol class formula_18 of Hörmander. The corresponding operator &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;D&quot;) is called a pseudo-differential operator of order m and belongs to the class
formula_19

==Properties==
Linear differential operators of order m with smooth bounded coefficients are pseudo-differential
operators of order &quot;m&quot;.
The composition &quot;PQ&quot; of two pseudo-differential operators &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; is again a pseudo-differential operator and the symbol of &quot;PQ&quot; can be calculated by using the symbols of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. The adjoint and transpose of a pseudo-differential operator is a pseudo-differential operator.

If a differential operator of order &quot;m&quot; is (uniformly) elliptic (of order &quot;m&quot;)
and invertible, then its inverse is a pseudo-differential operator of order −&quot;m&quot;, and its symbol can be calculated. This means that one can solve linear elliptic differential equations more or less explicitly
by using the theory of pseudo-differential operators.

Differential operators are &quot;local&quot; in the sense that one only needs the value of a function in a neighbourhood of a point to determine the effect of the operator. Pseudo-differential operators are &quot;pseudo-local&quot;, which means informally that when applied to a distribution they do not create a singularity at points where the distribution was already smooth.

Just as a differential operator can be expressed in terms of &quot;D&quot; = −id/d&quot;x&quot; in the form

:formula_20

for a polynomial &quot;p&quot; in &quot;D&quot; (which is called the &quot;symbol&quot;), a pseudo-differential operator has a symbol in a more general class of functions. Often one can reduce a problem in analysis of pseudo-differential operators to a sequence of algebraic problems involving their symbols, and this is the essence of microlocal analysis.

==Kernel of pseudo-differential operator==

Pseudo-differential operators can be represented by kernels. The singularity of the kernel on the diagonal depends on the degree of the corresponding operator. In fact, if the symbol satisfies the above differential inequalities with m ≤ 0, it can be shown that the kernel is a singular integral kernel.

<text>The Great North Run (branded the AJ Bell Great North Run for sponsorship purposes) is the largest half marathon in the world, taking place annually in North East England each September. Participants run between Newcastle upon Tyne and South Shields. The run was devised by former Olympic 10,000 m bronze medallist and BBC Sport commentator Brendan Foster.

The first Great North Run was staged on 28 June 1981, when 12,000 runners participated. By 2011, the number of participants had risen to 54,000. For the first year it was advertised as a local fun run; nearly thirty years on it has become one of the biggest running events in the world, and the biggest in the UK. Only the Great Manchester Run and London Marathon come close to attracting similar numbers of athletes each year.

The 1992 edition of the race incorporated the 1st IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. The event also has junior and mini races attached with these being run the Saturday before the main race on the Newcastle Quayside. Martin Mathathi holds the current men&#x27;s course record with his run of 58:56 in 2011. In 2019, Brigid Kosgei&#x27;s women&#x27;s course record of 64:28 bettered the previous mark by over a minute and was also the fastest ever half marathon by a woman; however, the course was not eligible for records. That same year, Mo Farah won a record sixth consecutive men&#x27;s Great North Run.

==Course==
The Great North Run starts in Newcastle upon Tyne on the A167 road (the central motorway), on the edge of both the city centre and the Town Moor. The route heads east and south down the motorway section, around the eastern side of the city centre, then crosses the Tyne Bridge into Gateshead. It heads around the eastern side of Gateshead town centre, then at a roundabout turns east and heads down the A184 (the Felling Bypass) in the direction of Sunderland. After , the route turns off the A184 and heads north-east towards South Shields down the A194 (Leam Lane). later, the route reaches the southern side of Jarrow and it turns east down the A1300 (John Reid Road). The route passes through the south of South Shields (through Harton and Marsden) until it reaches the seafront just over later, where it turns north up the A183. The last mile (1.6 km) of the route runs along the seafront road to the finishing line at South Shields. All roads on the course are closed several hours before the race begins, however multiple vehicles including TV crews, emergency services, event staff, and a fleet of buses carrying participants&#x27; belongings are authorised to travel between Newcastle and South Shields on the closed course roads ahead of and following the participants.

== History ==

The run was devised by former Olympic 10,000 m bronze medallist and BBC Sport commentator Brendan Foster. Foster was inspired after running in the Round the Bays Race in New Zealand in 1979, and has built upon the Great North Run with a series of other Great Run road races.

The first Great North Run was staged on 28 June 1981, when 12,000 runners participated. By 2003, the number of participants had risen to 47,000. The 2011 event saw an announced field of 54,000. The number of finishers was 35,777 in 2007, the largest half marathon and the 13th largest running race that year. In 2014, the event had 41,615 finishers, making it the largest half-marathon in the world as certified by Guinness World Records in 2016.

For the first nine races, eight of them were held in June. Since 1990, the race has instead been held in the autumn, usually in September but occasionally in October. Since 1990, the earliest date the race has been held on is 7 September (2014) and the latest is 22 October (2000). Bupa was the title partner of the Great North Run from the early 1990s until 2014, one of Britain&#x27;s longest ever sports sponsorship agreements. In 2015 Morrisons announced their sponsorship of the Great Run series. In November 2015, the Great Run Company announced it was searching for a new title sponsor which includes the Great North Run. The 2016 Great North Run was the first staging of the event without a title sponsor. Simplyhealth became the new lead sponsor for 2017. AJ Bell was announced as the new lead sponsor for the Great Run series in 2023 in a 5-year partnership

===Events===
In 2004 a runner died (the eighth death in the event&#x27;s then 24-year history).

The 2005 Great North Run was the twenty-fifth edition of the race. Events to mark the anniversary included the launch of the Great North Run Cultural Programme at the Sage Gateshead. The race was started by Mike McLeod, the winner of the inaugural race in 1981. During the race, four participants died en route to South Shields. An inquest into the four deaths from 2005 began on Monday 5 June 2006 at Gateshead Council Chambers. In subsequent events, more emergency service personnel were brought in to ensure there was adequate cover.

In spite of increased medical provision at the 2006 race, a man in his twenties died.

The 2007 Great North Run was held on 30 September and was started by former England and Newcastle United manager Sir Bobby Robson. Kara Goucher defeated Paula Radcliffe in an impressive victory for the American. Goucher&#x27;s winning time was 1:06:57.

The 2008 Great North Run was held on 5 October and was started by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair.

The 2009 Great North Run was held on 20 September and was started by the musician Sting.

The 2010 Great North Run was the 30th running of the event and was held on 19 September and was started by TV presenters Ant &amp; Dec. The number of finishers (half marathon only) was 39,459.

The 2011 Great North Run took place on the morning of Sunday, 18 September 2011. The race was started by World 5,000-metre champion Mo Farah.

In 2013 the 33rd Great North Run had 56000 participants, most of whom were raising money for charity. The elite races had Olympic Gold Medalists and World Champion long-distance runners participating including in the men&#x27;s race, Mo Farah, Kenenisa Bekele and a regular supporter of the event, Haile Gebrselassie. Ethiopian Bekele won the men&#x27;s event just ahead of Farah. Kenya&#x27;s Priscah Jeptoo came first the women&#x27;s race and multi Olympic Gold Medalist David Weir won the wheelchair event.

In 2014 the 34th Great North Run had 57000 participants, celebrated the 1 millionth runner to cross the finish line, and was the first to have a British man win in 29 years. Mo Farah completed the race in exactly 1 hour, while Mary Keitany completed in 1:05:39 seconds - surpassing the previous course record of 1:05:40 by 1 second, a record held by Paula Radcliffe. Tracey Cramond, who was raising money for Butterwick Hospices, was the 1 millionth person to complete the run, stating she was &quot;gobsmacked&quot; and that it was her &quot;moment of fame&quot;. The Great North Run was the first International Athletics Association Event (IAAF) event in the world to reach such a milestone.

In 2015 a 58 year old male runner died.

The 2020 Great North Run was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 event cancelled its Junior and Mini events due to the death of Elizabeth II.

Eddie Howe started the 2023 Great North Run for the 60,000 participants. The race was Mo Farah&#x27;s last ever before his retirement.

The 2024 Great North Run took place on 8th September and was started by Olympic Silver Medalist Kieran Reilly. A 29 year old male runner died after collapsing during the race.

<doc id="973510" wikidata="Q1010273" url="?curid=973510" title="Garni">
<text>Garni (), is a major village in the Kotayk Province of Armenia. It is known for the nearby classical temple. As of the 2011 census, the population of the village is 6,910.

== History ==
The settlement is best known for the Hellenistic Garni temple. The area was first occupied in the 3rd millennium BC along easily defensible terrain at one of the bends of the Azat River. 

In the 8th century BC the area was conquered by the Urartian King Argishti I. The fortification at Garni was erected probably some time in the 3rd century BC as a summer residence for the Armenian Orontid and Artaxiad royal dynasties. 

Later, around the 1st century AD, the fortress of Garni became the last refuge of King Mithridates of Armenia, and he and his family were assassinated there by his son-in-law and nephew Rhadamistus. The fortress was sacked in 1386 by Timur Lenk. In 1679 an earthquake devastated the area and destroyed the temple.

== Monuments and landmarks ==
Garni is notable for its fortress complex containing the 1st-century AD Garni Temple, Surb Astvatsatsin Church, Mashtots Hayrapet Church, a ruined 4th-century single-aisle church, a ruined Tukh Manuk Shrine, Saint Sargis Shrine, and a Queen Katranide Shrine.

Nearby is the Garni Gorge with well preserved basalt columns, carved out by the Goght River. This portion of the gorge is often referred to as the &quot;Symphony of the Stones&quot;. It is most easily reached via a road that leads left down the gorge just before reaching the temple of Garni. Another road leads to the gorge through the village, down a cobblestone road, and into the valley.

Once in the valley, turning right leads to Garni Gorge with an 11th-century medieval bridge and the &quot;Symphony of the Stones&quot;. Turning left leads along the river, past a fish hatchery, up to the Khosrov State Reserve and, a little further, Havuts Tar Monastery (which can be seen from the Garni temple). The medieval bridge was controversially reconstructed in 2013, in a project organized and paid for by the US government through its Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation. Critics said the work destroyed the original bridge and turned it into a new structure without value as an historical monument. Within the Khosrov reserve is Aghjots Vank from the 13th century, the church of Saint Stepanos, and the fortress of Kakavaberd. Garni lies along the road to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Geghard Monastery (a further 7 km southeast).

<doc id="973521" wikidata="Q7012639" url="?curid=973521" title="New Writers Press">
<text>New Writers&#x27; Press was an Irish small press that specialised in poetry publishing. The press was founded in 1967 by the poets Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce and Smith&#x27;s wife Irene in response to what they felt to be the stagnant state of Irish poetry at the time. The first volume published by the press was Joyce&#x27;s debut collection, &quot;Sole Glum Trek&quot;, which included an editorial by Smith that communicated the purpose of the press as follows:
:: [T]o bring out a series of small books each of which will give a young poet the chance of finding the audience so necessary to him ...
:: Most of the poets whose work will be included in this series are Irish and under thirty. Believing poets should be beyond the herd
:: instinct, they belong to no school, movement, club or clique. They are all serious poets, that is, human beings for whom writing poetry :: is morally, a profoundly central activity, not a mere hobby or ornamental grace. (Joyce, 1995: 277)

The press was very active for the first 12 years of its existence, publishing some 46 items, including the six issues of the journal &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;. Since 1979, there have been approximately 12 new titles, some of them in collaboration with British, Canadian and Polish small press publishers.

The press was committed to helping revive interest in the modernist tradition in Irish poetry, and to this end they published Thomas MacGreevy&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, Brian Coffey&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; and a special 1930s issue of the journal, all in 1971.

In addition to work by Coffey, MacGreevy, Joyce and Smith, New Writers Press authors included John Jordan, Anthony Cronin, Michael Hartnett, Augustus Young, Jack Spicer, Tom MacIntyre, Patrick Galvin, Paul Durcan, Robert Pawlowski, and Antonio Machado (in Smith&#x27;s translation).

<text>Goring-on-Thames (or Goring) is a village and civil parish on the River Thames in South Oxfordshire, England. Situated on the county border with Berkshire, it is south of Wallingford and north-west of Reading. It had a population of 3,187 in the 2011 census and was estimated to have increased to 3,335 by 2019. 

Most land is farmland, with woodland on the Goring Gap outcrop of the Chiltern Hills. Its riverside plain encloses the residential area, including a high street with shops, pubs and restaurants. Goring &amp; Streatley railway station lies on the Great Western Main Line, providing trains between London, , and .

The village church is dedicated to St Thomas Becket with a nave that was built within 50 years of the saint&#x27;s death, in the early 13th century, along with a later bell tower. Goring faces the smaller Streatley across the Thames; the two are linked by Goring and Streatley Bridge.

==Geography==

Goring is on the left bank of the River Thames in the Goring Gap between the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills, about north-west of Reading and south of Oxford. Across the river is the Berkshire village of Streatley, often seen as a twin village. They are linked by Goring and Streatley Bridge and its adjacent lock and weir. The Thames Path, Icknield Way and the Ridgeway cross the Thames at Goring. 

==Transport==

The Great Western Main Line serves Goring &amp; Streatley railway station; Great Western Railway operates trains between London Paddington, Reading, and Didcot. The service runs every 30 minutes on weekdays and Saturdays, and every hour on Sundays. 

GWR provide the service with British Rail Class 387 electric trains, and because
work on electrification from Didcot to has been suspended since 2019, the trains no longer run beyond Didcot Parkway. A separate diesel service runs between Didcot and Oxford. 

The local bus service between Goring and Wallingford is run by a Goring-based community interest company, &quot;Going Forward Buses&quot;, which was established in December 2016. The bus service to Wallingford runs hourly during the working day from Monday to Friday.

==Early history==
The name Goring first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Garinges&quot;, then as &quot;Garingies&quot; in a charter once held in the British Museum. It translates as &quot;Gara&#x27;s people&quot;.

==Religious sites==

The Church of England parish church of St Thomas of Canterbury displays Norman architecture of the early 12th century, with the bell-stage of a bell tower added in the 15th century. This has a ring of eight bells, one dating from 1290. The wood for the rood screen was taken from , one of Nelson&#x27;s fleet at Trafalgar. A church hall was added in 1901.

The Anglican Churches of Goring, Streatley and South Stoke form a united benefice. A priory of Augustinian nuns was built late in the 12th century with its own priory church adjoining St Thomas&#x27;s. This survived until demolished with the early 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries. The foundations of the priory church, cloister, dormitory, vestry, chapter house and parlour were excavated in 1892. 

Goring Free Church belongs to the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion. The congregation was founded in 1788 and its first chapel built in 1793. At its centenary in 1893, a new church building was added and the original chapel converted into a church hall. It holds two Sunday services. 

The Catholic Church of Our Lady and St John the Apostle was designed by the architect William Ravenscroft and built in 1898. It now forms a single parish with the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King in Woodcote.

==Amenities==

Goring United Football Club plays in the Reading Football League. Goring-on-Thames Cricket Club, founded in 1876, has two teams in the Berkshire Cricket League. Goring has a lawn tennis club with teams that play in two local leagues. Goring and Streatley Golf Club is located in adjoining Streatley. 

Goring-on-Thames&#x27; &quot;Decorative and Fine Arts Society&quot;, founded in 1987, belongs to the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies. Goring has a Women&#x27;s Institute.

<text>Crelle&#x27;s Journal, or just Crelle, is the common name for a mathematics journal, the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (in English: &quot;Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics&quot;).

== History ==
The journal was founded by August Leopold Crelle (Berlin) in 1826 and edited by him until his death in 1855. It was one of the first major mathematical journals that was not a proceedings of an academy. It has published many notable papers, including works of Niels Henrik Abel, Georg Cantor, Gotthold Eisenstein, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Otto Hesse. It was edited by Carl Wilhelm Borchardt from 1856 to 1880, during which time it was known as &quot;Borchardt&#x27;s Journal&quot;. The current editor-in-chief is Daniel Huybrechts (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn).

<text>is a Finnish commercial television channel. It started out as Helsinki&#x27;s local television channel PTV in 1990 on the HTV cable network (now part of DNA), and changed its name first to PTV4. On June 1, 1997, the channel expanded to national coverage and changed its name to Nelonen, the Finnish name of the number four. Nelonen is mostly owned by Sanoma Corporation, which owns the &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; and &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; newspapers. Its largest owner was Aatos Erkko. Much of its programming is imported Australian, American, British, and European programs with Finnish captions. Its main market is the 25-44 demographic.

== Logos and identities ==
== Criticism ==
Nelonen was launched quickly and in an unprepared state. It has been criticized for importing &quot;trash shows&quot;, especially during its first years. Mostly the subject of criticism have been related to its weekly imported &quot;4D documentaries&quot; concentrating on entertainment value and on highly emotive issues instead of artistic or other deeper values. The channel&#x27;s entertainment output also consists of many other programmes which may be considered to be poor quality - imported game shows or Finnish versions of them (such as &quot;Reikä seinässä&quot;, a Finnish version of the Japanese &#x27;Human Tetris&#x27; game) and reality TV shows dominate the scheduling. On the other hand, Nelonen&#x27;s scheduling also contains several award-winning drama series.

== Controversy ==
During the fall of 2007, a day after the Jokela school shooting, Nelonen decided not to air a scheduled episode of the TV series &quot;Dexter&quot;. The TV series depicts a fictional serial killer Dexter Morgan and it was said to be inappropriate after such dramatic and nationwide turn of events. The episode was instead shown a week later.

<text>August Leopold Crelle (17 March 1780 – 6 October 1855) was a German mathematician. He was born in Eichwerder near Wriezen, Brandenburg, and died in Berlin. He is the founder of &quot;Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik&quot; (also known as &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;). He befriended Niels Henrik Abel and published seven of Abel&#x27;s papers in the first volume of his journal.

In 1841, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1853.

<text>Johannes Acronius (1565 – 29 September 1627) was a German Reformed theologian. He is less known by scientific works, than by his part in the quarrel between Arminians (Remonstrants) and Contra-Remonstrants (see History of Calvinist–Arminian debate).

==Life==
He was born in Grimersum, East Frisia, the son of a preacher, Bernardus Acronius, in a village north of Emden, now in the municipality of Krummhörn. He was taught by Zacharias Ursinus and Franciscus Junius in Neustadt an der Hardt, today Neustadt an der Weinstrasse. In 1584 he became a preacher in Eilsum, East Frisia, later in 1601 he was called to Groningen where he served for 10 years, during which time he was called several times to Amsterdam, but he refused as he did not want to take part in the arguments between Franciscus Gomarus and Jacobus Arminius. In 1611 he was called to Wesel, but when that city was conquered by the Spanish he fled to Deventer. He declined calls to Haarlem and Deventer, because he couldn&#x27;t preach about the political situation in the church that had so nearly cost him his life. Unable to preach, in 1617 he became professor for theology at the University of Franeker. Once installed, he preached there now and then on Sundays and served as substitute in nearby Kampen, Overijssel. Contra-remonstrants there sent him to the Synod of Dort, mainly to counter some of his colleagues in this area who were deemed too favourable towards Arminius&#x27; teachings. Being the delegate of the church assembly of Dordrecht in 1618–1619, he indeed accused them of Arminianism, resulting in the unseating of several.

In 1619 he went to work as a preacher in Haarlem where his portrait was painted by Frans Hals and where he stayed until his death. The Calvinists of the time saw in him an educated man of oratory skills, with the fervour to stand for their truth. His opponents described him as an unsettled man with a tendency to polemise.

<doc id="973569" wikidata="Q2110020" url="?curid=973569" title="List of mammals of Great Britain">
<text>This is a list of mammals of Great Britain. The diversity of mammal fauna of Great Britain is somewhat impoverished compared to that of Continental Europe, due to the short period of time between the last ice age and the flooding of the land bridge between Great Britain and the rest of Europe. Only those land species which crossed before the creation of the English Channel and those introduced by humans exist in Great Britain.

Native (usually synonymous with &quot;indigenous&quot;) species are considered to be species which are today present in the region in question, and have been continuously present in that region since a certain period of time. When applied to Great Britain, three possible definitions of this time constraint are:

* a species that colonised the islands during the glacial retreat at the end of the last ice age ( 9500 years ago);
* a species that was present when the English Channel was created (c. 8000 years ago); or,
* a species that was present in prehistory.

This list includes mammals from the small islands around Great Britain and the Channel Islands. There are no endemic mammal species in Great Britain, although four distinct subspecies of rodents have arisen on small islands.

The following tags are used to highlight the conservation status of each species&#x27; British population, as assessed by Natural England and The Mammal Society in a Regional Red List, following the criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
== Diprotodonts==
Order: Diprotodontia

Although marsupials are primarily found in the Australian region, the red-necked wallaby has been introduced to parts of Great Britain. Feral populations breed on the island of Inchconnachan on Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, and on the Isle of Man. Other colonies have existed in Devon, the Peak District, and the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, and although these are now believed to be locally extinct, occasional sightings continue.

Family: Macropodidae (kangaroos, wallabies, and kin)
* Red-necked wallaby, &quot;Notamacropus rufogriseus&quot; introduced

== Rodents ==
Order: Rodentia

Rodents are the largest order of mammals, comprising 40% of all species. They are characterised by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws and are native to almost all major landmasses on Earth.

Family: Castoridae (beavers)
* Eurasian beaver, &quot;Castor fiber&quot; globally, in Great Britain, reintroduced

Family: Cricetidae (hamsters, voles, and kin)
* European water vole, &quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot; globally, in Great Britain
* Short-tailed field vole, &quot;Microtus agrestis&quot; 
* Common vole, &quot;Microtus arvalis&quot; 
**Orkney vole, &quot;M. a. orcadensis&quot; 
* Bank vole, &quot;Myodes glareolus&quot; 

Family: Muridae (mice, rats, and kin)

* Yellow-necked mouse, &quot;Apodemus flavicollis&quot; 
* Wood mouse, &quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot; 
**St Kilda field mouse, &quot;A. s. hirtensis&quot; 
* Eurasian harvest mouse, &quot;Micromys minutus&quot; 
* House mouse, &quot;Mus musculus&quot; 
**St Kilda house mouse, &quot;M. m. muralis&quot; c. 1930
*Brown rat, &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; introduced
* Black rat, &quot;Rattus rattus&quot; introduced

Family: Gliridae (dormice)
* European edible dormouse, &quot;Glis glis&quot; introduced
* Hazel dormouse, &quot;Muscardinus avellanarius&quot; globally, in Great Britain

Family: Sciuridae (squirrels)
* Eastern grey squirrel, &quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot; introduced
* Red squirrel, &quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot; globally, in Great Britain

== Lagomorphs ==

Order: Lagomorpha

The lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Although they can resemble rodents, and were classified as a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since been considered a separate order. They differ from rodents in a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two.

Family: Leporidae (rabbits and hares)
* European hare, &quot;Lepus europaeus&quot; introduced
* Mountain hare, &quot;Lepus timidus&quot; 
* European rabbit, &quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot; introduced

== Eulipotyphlans ==
Order: Eulipotyphla

The order Eulipotyphla contains insectivorous mammals. Hedgehogs are easily recognised by their spines, while gymnures look more like large rats. Shrews and solenodons closely resemble mice, while moles are stout-bodied burrowers.

Family: Talpidae (moles)
* European mole, &quot;Talpa europaea&quot; 

Family: Soricidae (shrews)
* Lesser white-toothed shrew, &quot;Crocidura suaveolens&quot; 
* Eurasian water shrew, &quot;Neomys fodiens&quot; 
* Common shrew, &quot;Sorex araneus&quot; 
* Eurasian pygmy shrew, &quot;Sorex minutus&quot; 

Family: Erinaceidae (hedgehogs and moonrats)
* European hedgehog, &quot;Erinaceus europaeus&quot; globally, in Great Britain

== Bats ==
Order: Chiroptera

Bats&#x27; most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.

<text>The Ritz Brothers were an American family comedy act consisting of brothers Al (1901–1965), Jimmy (1904–1985), and Harry Ritz (1907–1986) who performed extensively on stage, in nightclubs and in films from 1925 to the late 1970s. A fourth brother, George, acted as their manager.

==Early life==
The four brothers were born in Newark, New Jersey to Austrian Jewish haberdasher Max Joachim and his wife Pauline. They also had a sister Gertrude.

Harry explained on a Joe Franklin TV interview that the family name was pronounced &quot;joe-ACK-him&quot;, and that eldest brother Al, a vaudeville dancer, adopted a new professional name after he saw the name &quot;Ritz&quot; on the side of a laundry truck. Jimmy and Harry followed suit when the brothers formed a team. The Ritzes emphasized precision dancing in their act, and added comedy material as they went along. By the early 1930s they were stage headliners.

==Movie career==
In 1934 Educational Pictures, producers of short subjects, hired &quot;The Three Ritz Brothers&quot; to make a series of six two-reel comedies in New York. The first, &quot;Hotel Anchovy&quot;, did well enough for the film&#x27;s distributor, 20th Century-Fox, to void the Educational contract and hire the team as a specialty act for feature-length musicals, to be filmed in Hollywood. From 1935 to 1937 the brothers barged in on the action in several musical comedies, including &quot;Sing, Baby, Sing&quot;, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, and the Irving Berlin musical &quot;On the Avenue&quot;. In 1937 Fox gave the Ritz Brothers their own starring series, beginning with &quot;Life Begins in College&quot;.

The brothers had a large following, and some fans compared them to the Marx Brothers, but the Ritzes did not play contrasting characters like the Marxes did, instead adopting the same boisterous behavior, making it harder for audiences to tell them apart. The ringleader was always rubber-faced, mouthy Harry, with Jimmy and Al enthusiastically following his lead. They frequently broke into songs and dances during their feature comedies, and often did celebrity impersonations (among them Ted Lewis, Peter Lorre, Tony Martin, and even Alice Faye and Katharine Hepburn). The brothers were caricatured in animated cartoons, including the 1937 Warner Bros. short &quot;A Sunbonnet Blue&quot; and the 1939 Walt Disney short &quot;The Autograph Hound&quot;.

Their talent was also noted by Samuel Goldwyn, who borrowed them from Fox for his Technicolor variety show, &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot;, where they appeared with other headliners of the day including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Perhaps their most successful film during this period was Fox&#x27;s 1939 musical-comedy version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, co-starring Don Ameche.
Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck always viewed Harry Ritz as the star of the act, with Al and Jimmy as excess baggage. Zanuck&#x27;s handwritten notes on Ritz scripts insisted that Harry&#x27;s roles and dialogue should be built up. Zanuck even told Harry what a big star he &quot;could&quot; be if he only got rid of his brothers. Harry ended the conversation immediately, refusing to consider splitting the act. Zanuck bought an old Ralph Spence play, &quot;The Gorilla&quot; (staged in 1925), and pushed the Ritzes into a 1939 film version. The Ritzes complained about the low quality of the script and staged a highly publicized walkout. Zanuck responded by completing &quot;The Gorilla&quot; anyway, terminating the Ritzes&#x27; starring series, and casting them in a B picture: &quot;Pack Up Your Troubles&quot; starring Jane Withers. Zanuck then arranged to loan the brothers out to Republic Pictures, a minor-league &quot;budget&quot; studio known for westerns and serials. The Ritz Brothers refused the deal and left Fox for good in late 1939.

In 1940 they moved to Universal Pictures, where they were scheduled to star in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; but were removed from that production and reassigned to make brash B comedies with music. Their final film as a trio was &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; (1943).

==Nightclubs and television==
The Ritz Brothers left Hollywood in 1943 to concentrate on their nightclub act and personal appearances. In the 1950s they made guest appearances on network television (including &quot;All Star Revue&quot;, a 1952 comedy hour broadcast live, in which the Ritzes dominated the action and earned rave reviews). They soon became a top Las Vegas attraction. In 1958 Harry participated in a sketch-comedy LP, &quot;Hilarity in Hollywood&quot; (also known as &quot;Hilarity in Hi-Fi&quot;).

The Ritzes were appearing at the New Orleans Roosevelt Hotel in December 1965 when Al died of a sudden heart attack. Harry and Jimmy were devastated, as the trio had always been close. The two surviving brothers continued the act and appeared together in several films. The last appearances of the Ritz Brothers as a team (minus Al) were in the mid-1970s films &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; and &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot;, a spoof of the old &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot; and &quot;Lassie&quot; movies. In &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; the Ritzes were cast as replacements for The Three Stooges, who dropped out of the film when Moe Howard&#x27;s declining health forced the trio to cancel. (Contrary to many accounts, Moe was still alive when &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; filmed in March 1975; he was too ill to work. Moe died in early May of that year; &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; opened a month later in June 1975.) Harry and Jimmy made semi-regular appearances on the 1970 television revival of the comedy-themed game show, &quot;Can You Top This?&quot; and made a lively encore appearance on television, as guests on Dick Cavett&#x27;s PBS talk show.

In 1979, television producer Garry Marshall (&quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;) prepared an American version of the British sitcom&quot; Are You Being Served?&quot; The British series was set in the venerable Grace Bros. department store, owned by the elderly Mr. Grace (Harold Bennett). The American adaptation, retitled &quot;Beane&#x27;s of Boston&quot;, cast Harry Ritz as the owner, Mr. Beane. In the pilot, which did not sell, Tom Poston plays the role and Harry Ritz does not appear.

Harry&#x27;s final months were plagued by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; Jimmy Ritz died in 1985 shortly before Harry, but Harry&#x27;s health was so delicate that he was never told of his brother&#x27;s death. Harry died five months later.

The brothers were entombed in Hollywood Cemetery, now called the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California. They are entombed near each other in the Hall of David Mausoleum.

==Tributes==
The influence of the Ritz Brothers was greater than their film career, in part because of their long career as nightclub entertainers. They influenced actors including Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, and Sid Caesar. In his 1976 film &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, Mel Brooks paid tribute to the Ritz Brothers by casting Harry in a cameo (he is the fellow leaving a tailor&#x27;s shop). It was the actor&#x27;s last role.

In a 1976 &quot;Esquire&quot; article, Harry Stein makes the case that many top comedians were influenced by, and even borrowed bits from, Harry Ritz. In an interview in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, George Carlin said Harry Ritz &quot;invented the moves for a whole generation&quot; of comedians.

Other tributes to them include mentions in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (episode &quot;Mountain of Madness&quot;), &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (episode &quot;Aid Station&quot;), &quot;Soap (TV series)&quot; (episode 48), and the films &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;: &quot;On the funny side, there&#x27;s the Marx Brothers, except Zeppo, the Ritz Brothers, no exceptions, both Laurel &quot;and&quot; Hardy, and Woody Woodpecker.&quot; Another tribute to The Ritz Brothers appeared in &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (Season 6, Episode 30, &quot;The Book Report&quot;), where Beaver (Theodore Cleaver) writes a book report about &#x27;The Three Musketeers&#x27; based on the Ritz Brothers movie of the same name.

They received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987, in response to a campaign led by comedians Jan Murray, Red Buttons, Milton Berle, and Phyllis Diller. In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to them.

They were the favorite musical clowns of the German-Jewish poet Else Lasker-Schüler, and they appear as characters in her last play, &quot;I and I&quot; (&quot;Ich und Ich&quot;).

Norman Lear has said of Harry Ritz and the Ritz Brothers, &quot;Harry Ritz was as funny as any human being, in or out of comedy, I have ever [met]... he was a jewel, in a glorious setting, and his brothers were the setting.&quot;

<doc id="973576" wikidata="Q153293" url="?curid=973576" title="Felix Magath">
<text>Wolfgang Felix Magath (; born 26 July 1953) is a German football manager and former player.

The most notable spell of his playing career was with Hamburger SV, with whom he won three Bundesliga titles, the 1977 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final and the 1983 European Cup Final, scoring in both finals. He also gained 43 international caps for the West Germany national team, winning UEFA Euro 1980 and reaching two consecutive World Cup finals.

As a manager, Magath&#x27;s honours include two consecutive Doubles (Bundesliga and German Cup titles) with Bayern Munich, and a further Bundesliga title with VfL Wolfsburg in 2009. He has a reputation of demanding strong discipline and thorough training.

In 2014, Magath coached English club Fulham, becoming the first German to manage in the Premier League.

==Playing career==
Born near Aschaffenburg, Magath started his career playing for local club Viktoria Aschaffenburg. From 1974 to 1976, he played for 1. FC Saarbrücken, at that time in the second division, before moving to Hamburger SV in the top flight. He spent the following ten seasons with Hamburg, and from his debut in 1976 to his retirement he scored 46 goals in 306 games in the West German top flight.

In 1983, Magath led Hamburg to success in the European Cup, scoring the single goal in the final against Juventus; in 1980–81, he netted a career-best (in the first division) ten goals, helping his side to a runner-up league spot, as Hamburg also won the league in three years during that time.

Magath also represented the West Germany national team at many international events, including the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups, helping West Germany finish in second place both times. He was also part of the squad that won the 1980 UEFA European Championship. Magath made his debut on 30 April 1977, in a 2–1 friendly win with Yugoslavia, and went on to amass 43 caps, with three goals.

==Style of play==
A talented, creative, and intelligent diminutive playmaker, with an eye for goal, Magath normally played either as an attacking or central midfielder, and was an elegant player on the ball, who possessed excellent technical skills, vision, and stamina, despite his lack of significant pace and his stocky physique. He was also a strong passer and striker of the ball with his left foot, and stood out for his work-rate on the pitch, as well as his ability to interpret the game. Considered to be a decisive player, he is rated by pudits as one of the greatest midfielders in the history of the Bundesliga.

==Managerial career==
===1986–1992: general manager===
Having suffered a career-ending knee injury, Magath retired shortly after the 1986 World Cup and became general manager for his former club Hamburg. He left Hamburg in June 1988 after moderate success. His next stints as general manager included then 2. Bundesliga, side 1. FC Saarbrücken (November 1989 to June 1990), as well as Bayer Uerdingen (July 1990 to January 1992), who were relegated from the first tier during Magath&#x27;s time at the club.

===1992–2001: early coaching career===
Magath took up coaching in 1992 as a player-coach for the fourth-tier club FC Bremerhaven, which he led to division championship. He then rejoined Hamburger SV as reserves coach in 1993, and became manager Benno Möhlmann&#x27;s assistant soon after. Magath succeeded Möhlmann as manager after the latter was sacked in October 1995. His first match was a 2–2 draw against 1860 Munich. Having reached the UEFA Cup during his first season, Hamburg finished in fifth place. The following season as disappointing 15th at the time Magath was sacked. His final match was a 4–0 loss to 1. FC Köln. He finished with a record of 28 wins, 19 draws, and 22 losses.

In the following years, Magath acquired a reputation as the &quot;fireman&quot;, coming in at difficult times at a club and leading it to salvation. In September 1997, he took over 1. FC Nürnberg who were newly promoted to the 2. Bundesliga and fighting relegation. His first match was a 0–0 draw against KFC Uerdingen 05. &quot;Der Club&quot; finished the season in third–place, meaning promotion to the Bundesliga, but Magath left due to differences in opinion with the club president Michael A. Roth. He finished with a record of 16 wins, eight draws, and five losses. During a short stint at Werder Bremen during the 1998–99 season, Magath lead the club out of relegation places, only for Bremen to find themselves in the relegation dogfight again with two games to go. At this point he was replaced as manager by Thomas Schaaf who helped them avoid relegation by a point. Magath also helped Bremen get to the final of the DFB-Pokal however he was sacked before the final itself, which Bremen won in his absence. He had nine wins, seven draws, and ten losses. Halfway through the 1999–00 season, Magath joined troubled Eintracht Frankfurt. An impressive Magath-inspired run saw Frankfurt finish the second round as third best and four points off relegation. Magath was sacked the season after (29 January 2001) when Frankfurt found themselves in the relegation zone. His last match was a 5–1 loss to Köln. He finished with record of 15 wins, five draws, and 17 losses.

===2001–2007: head coach at Stuttgart and Bayern===

Magath bounced back with what was to become one of his most successful stints when he took over fellow relegation battlers VfB Stuttgart a few weeks after. Having narrowly avoided relegation in 2001, Stuttgart finished the 2001–02 in a mid-table position. The club went then on to become 2002–03 Bundesliga runners-up and finished the 2003–04 season as respectable fourth. During this time, Magath also introduced a group of players from the Stuttgart youth ranks, such as Timo Hildebrand, Andreas Hinkel and Kevin Kurányi, who became known as &quot;die jungen Wilden&quot; (wild youth). The Stuttgart stint was also the first time Magath combined the head coach and the director of football roles. He finished with a record of 73 wins, 37 draws, and 37 losses.

Having impressed with Stuttgart, Magath was handed the FC Bayern Munich job on 1 July 2004. In his first season, Magath was able to lead his team to victory in both the league and cup, completing the double, a feat which would be repeated in 2005–06, the first time ever in the competition&#x27;s history.

However, after a slow start to the 2006–07 season, with the team mired in fourth place which would not qualify them for the Champions League, Magath was sacked on 31 January 2007. He finished with a record of 84 wins, 25 draws, and 22 losses.

===2007–2012: head coach and director of football combined===
In June 2007, Magath signed a contract with VfL Wolfsburg, as head coach and director of football. Magath lead the &quot;Wolves&quot; to play in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup and the following season&#x27;s Champions League, the latter as league champions for the first time. He finished with a record of 46 wins, 18 draws, and 21 losses.

Before the season 2008–09 had ended, Magath agreed on a four-year contract with Schalke 04, again as both head coach and director of football, starting on 1 July 2009. Schalke finished Magath&#x27;s first season in charge as runners-up, but after a series of disappointing domestic performances and growing player discontent, Magath was sacked by Schalke in March 2011. the following day, Magath claimed that he had not been informed of his dismissal. He finished with a record of 42 wins, 16 draws, and 21 losses.

Only 48 hours later, on 18 March, Magath once again signed with now relegation-battling VfL Wolfsburg, the side he had previously led to the league title in 2009. Magath steered the club to safety, avoiding the relegation play–off by two points, but though the club invested heavily, Magath could only achieve a mid-table finish in the following 2011–12 season. After only five points in eight matches (and no goals and points in the last four games) in the 2012–13 season, Magath left the club by mutual consent on 25 October 2012. He finished with a record of 18 wins, 10 draws, and 24 losses.

===2014–2017: return to management with Fulham and Shandong Luneng Taishan===
On 14 February 2014, Fulham released a statement that Magath would be their new first team manager effective immediately on an eighteen-month contract. Magath brought in Tomas Oral as first team coach and Werner Leuthard as the person in charge of conditioning while the club dismissed manager Rene Meulensteen, assistant coach Ray Wilkins, technical director Alan Curbishley, and first team coaches Mick Priest and Jonathan Hill. The role was Magath&#x27;s first in two years and at the time his only venture outside of his native Germany. Magath believed that he could save Fulham from relegation and that 12 matches was enough to save the club. Fulham played their first match under Magath on 22 February 2014. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with Ashkan Dejagah, Magath&#x27;s former player at VfL Wolfsburg, being the first Fulham goalscorer of Magath&#x27;s tenure. 

On 15 March, Fulham won their first match with Magath in charge against Newcastle United, with Dejagah being the lone scorer. Magath picked up four points from his first six matches and answered questions about a potential resignation. On 3 May 2014, Fulham were relegated from the Premier League after a 4–1 loss to Stoke City. Magath believed that Fulham could earn immediate promotion. He started the 2014–15 season with four consecutive losses to Ipswich Town, Millwall, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Derby County. On 18 September 2014 Magath was sacked as Fulham manager after a run of eleven league games without a win. He finished with a record of four wins, four draws, and 12 losses.

After Gerald Baumgartner was sacked by Austria Wien, Magath eventually became the &quot;preferred&quot; choice. Spartak Moscow also offered Magath a contract. Thorsten Fink and Dmitriy Alenichev took the coaching jobs. He eventually took the job at Shandong Luneng Taishan, replacing former Brazil national football team manager Mano Menezes. He took the job on 8 June 2016. He made his debut on 12 June 2016 in a 2–1 loss against Hebei China Fortune. His first win was a 2–1 win against Jiangsu Suning on 9 July 2016. Four days later, he got his second win against Shijiazhuang Ever Bright, a 4–0 win.

He led Shandong throughout the 2017 Chinese Super League, finishing 6th, but left the club shortly after the end of the season.

===2020–present: FLYERALARM Global Soccer===
In January 2020, Magath revealed that his time as a coach was over and that he wanted to &quot;help football in a different way&quot;. In step with this, he introduced himself as the new boss of FLYERALARM Global Soccer. Magath became responsible for FLYERALARM&#x27;s commitment to the clubs Würzburger Kickers in Germany and Flyeralarm Admira, formerly known as FC Admira Wacker Mödling.

===2022: Hertha BSC===
On 13 March 2022, Magath became Hertha BSC&#x27;s third head coach of the 2021–22 season after he replaced Tayfun Korkut, who had replaced Pál Dárdai in November 2021. On 17 March 2022, Magath tested positive for COVID-19 and had to postpone his debut match.

==Reputation as a manager==
As a manager, Magath quickly gained respect and became known for his hard, grinding training methods, laying heavy emphasis on discipline, fitness and conditioning. Players gave him nicknames like &quot;Saddam&quot; (Saddam Hussein) or &quot;Quälix&quot;, a portmanteau of his first name Felix and the German verb &quot;quälen&quot; (to torture). His methods have also been considered to be controversial in the media, however. He was once described by former Eintracht Frankfurt player Bachirou Salou as the &quot;last dictator in Europe&quot;. 

After leaving Fulham in September 2014, bizarre stories emerged about how Magath had suggested that Brede Hangeland rub cheese on a thigh injury. Magath stated that Hangeland did not have a thigh injury but an inflammation of the knee, and that he suggested the additional use of an alternative treatment with a bandage (dressing) consisting of Quark. Fulham player Sascha Riether later said that the story was greatly exaggerated and that Magath had suggested he use a traditional topfen curd.

==Personal life==

Magath is the son of a Puerto Rican former soldier in the United States Army stationed in Aschaffenburg and a German mother. In 1954, Magath&#x27;s father abandoned Magath and his mother to return to his homeland. The adolescent Magath first heard from his father when he was 15 years old, after he wrote a letter to Puerto Rico.

Magath is also a chess enthusiast, an interest which he developed during the 1978 World Chess Championship while he was bedridden due to hepatitis. In 1985, he played in a simultaneous exhibition against Garry Kasparov.

<doc id="973585" wikidata="Q5509459" url="?curid=973585" title="Fur Rendezvous Festival">
<text>The Fur Rendezvous Festival (usually called Fur Rendezvous, Fur Rondy, or simply Rondy) is an annual winter festival held in Anchorage, Alaska, in late February. The self-styled &quot;largest winter festival in North America&quot;, Fur Rendezvous is highly anticipated by many Anchorage-area residents as marking the beginning of the end of a long winter and the approach of spring. In 2012, Fur Rendezvous was selected as the number one winter carnival in the world by the National Geographic Traveler. 

== History and origins ==
The name &quot;Fur Rendezvous&quot; derives from swap meets at which fur trappers would gather to sell their winter harvests. In early Anchorage, these usually took place in mid-February.

In 1935, Anchorage had a population of only about 3,000 and was very isolated, so to bring the community together and lift spirits, resident Vern Johnson organized a three-day sports tournament, called the &quot;Winter Sports Carnival&quot;, timed to coincide with the rendezvous, which brought increased activity. As the fur trade was then the second-largest industry in Alaska, folding it into the event seemed natural, and it was renamed the &quot;Winter Sports Tournament and Fur Rendezvous&quot; from 1937, and later just Fur Rendezvous.

It was common for miners and trappers to have beards in the early days, so a &quot;law&quot; was even made that all men had to grow beards for this event or suffer a fine. This was considered to be part of the fun.

Fur Rendezvous was canceled during the war years, but resumed in 1946, when the festival began to draw visitors from Outside, and has been held every year since. Since 1955 the event has been run by the non-profit Greater Anchorage, Inc.

Traditionally Fur Rendezvous lasted ten days, but since 2004 it has extended through early March, in order to lead into the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and draw more visitors.

2021 will see a modified festival, but the Open World Championship Sled Dog Race will be on hiatus until 2022.

== Events ==
The original Winter Sports Carnival included skiing, hockey, basketball, boxing, and a sled dog race for children, as well as a bonfire and torchlight parade. Modern Rondy has well over 100 events; some of the more significant include:
* Rondy Grand Prix – The Oldest Street Race in the U.S.
* Official Fur Rondy Fur Auction – the descendant of the original fur trade rendezvous, present since the earliest days.
* Miners&#x27; and Trappers&#x27; Charity Ball and Mr. Fur Face beard contest (since 1950) - Beards are grown as long as possible and they are dyed, decorated and shaped for this contest.
* World Championship Sled Dog Race (since 1946, with a women&#x27;s race since 1953) - This three-day, 75-mile sled dog race brings mushers from across Alaska and the world. However, it is sometimes canceled in recent years due to warm weather, with the most recent cancellation being in 2006.
* World Championship Dog Weight Pull (since 1967) - sled dogs attempt to pull the greatest weight
* Miss Fur Rendezvous pageant (from at least late 1950s through mid 1970s), also called Miss Fur Rondy
* Snow Sculpture Competition
* Fur Rondy Carnival
* Frostbite Footrace – Costumed competitors run through downtown Anchorage
* Rondy Grand Parade
* Running of the Reindeer – a whimsical annual event, started in 2008, that sends &quot;herds&quot; of people running down a four-block downtown street, with a group of reindeer released behind them, charging through the runners in a spoof of Pamplona&#x27;s Running of the Bulls.
* Rondy on Ice – figure skating show
* World Ice Bowling Championships

Many events tend toward the whimsical, such as the Outhouse Races (in which teams build outhouses and pull them on skis with a rider inside), ice bowling, or even snowshoe softball matches. Others focus on Alaska Native culture, such as the Multi-Tribal Gathering and Charlotte Jensen Native Arts Market.

==Pins==
Since 1939, promotional pins have been created and sold each year to raise money for the event. These pins have become popular collectibles, and older or rare pins can sell well in excess of $100. The Kiwanis Club of Anchorage nee University Kiwanis Club sells pins and booster buttons dressed as Keystone Cops for the duration of the festival. During the parade the Keystone Cops, or &quot;Rondy Kops,&quot; playfully detain attendees in a mobile jail until pins or buttons are purchased in exchange for their release. The 2025 festival pin was inspired by the Anchorage White Raven.

<doc id="973588" wikidata="Q424280" url="?curid=973588" title="Loop diuretic">
<text>Loop diuretics are pharmacological agents that primarily inhibit the Na-K-Cl cotransporter located on the luminal membrane of cells along the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. They are often used for the treatment of hypertension and edema secondary to congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or chronic kidney disease. While thiazide diuretics are more effective in patients with normal kidney function, loop diuretics are more effective in patients with impaired kidney function.

==Mechanism of action==
Loop diuretics are 90% bonded to proteins and are secreted into the proximal convoluted tubule through organic anion transporter 1 (OAT-1), OAT-2, and ABCC4. Loop diuretics act on the Na+-K+-2Cl− symporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to inhibit sodium, chloride and potassium reabsorption. This is achieved by competing for the Cl− binding site. Loop diuretics also inhibit NKCC2 at macula densa, reducing sodium transported into macula densa cells. This stimulates the release of renin, which through renin–angiotensin system, increases fluid retention in the body, increases the perfusion of glomerulus, thus increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At the same time, loop diuretics inhibit the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism so that increase in salts at the lumen near macula densa does not trigger a response that reduces the GFR.

Loop diuretics also inhibit magnesium and calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. Absorption of magnesium and calcium are dependent upon the positive voltage at the luminal side and less positive voltage at the interstitial side with transepithelial voltage gradient of 10 mV. This causes the magnesium and calcium ions to be repelled from luminal side to interstitial side, promoting their absorption. The difference in voltage in both sides is set up by potassium recycling through renal outer medullary potassium channel. By inhibiting the potassium recycling, the voltage gradient is abolished and magnesium and calcium reabsorption are inhibited. By disrupting the reabsorption of these ions, loop diuretics prevent the generation of a hypertonic renal medulla. Without such a concentrated medulla, water has less of an osmotic driving force to leave the collecting duct system, ultimately resulting in increased urine production. Loop diuretics cause a decrease in the renal blood flow by this mechanism. This diuresis leaves less water to be reabsorbed into the blood, resulting in a decrease in blood volume.

A secondary effect of loop diuretics is to increase the production of prostaglandins, which results in vasodilation and increased blood supply to the kidney. Prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation of preglomerular afferent arterioles increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and facilitates diuresis. The collective effects of decreased blood volume and vasodilation help decrease blood pressure and ameliorate edema.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Loop diuretics are highly protein bound and therefore have a low volume of distribution. The protein bound nature of the loop diuretic molecules causes it to be secreted via several transporter molecules along the luminal wall of the proximal convoluted tubules to be able to exert its function.

Loop diuretics usually have a ceiling effect whereby doses greater than a certain maximum amount will not increase the clinical effect of the drug. Also, there is a threshold minimum concentration of loop diuretics that needs to be achieved at the thick ascending limb to enable the onset of abrupt diuresis. 

The availability of furosemide is highly variable, ranging from 10% to 90%. The biological half-life of furosemide is limited by absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. The apparent half-life of its excretion is higher than the apparent half-life of absorption via the oral route. Therefore, furosemide taken intravenously is twice as potent as an equivalent dose taken orally.

However, for torsemide and bumetanide, their oral bioavailability is consistently higher than 90%. Torsemide has a longer half life in heart failure patients (6hours) than furosemide (2.7hours). A 40mg dose of furosemide is clinically equivalent to a 20mg dose of torsemide and to a 1mg dose of bumetanide.

==Clinical use==
Loop diuretics are principally used in the following indications:
* Heart failure - Giving 2.5 times of previous oral dose twice daily for those with acute decompensated heart failure is a reasonable strategy. However, daily assessment of clinical response is needed to adjust the subsequent doses.
* Edema - Volume overload associated with liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or nephrotic syndrome
* Cerebral edema - intravenous furosemide can be combined with mannitol to initiate rapid diuresis. However, the optimum duration of such treatment remains unknown. Frequent fluid status monitoring is required to prevent intravascular volume depletion which leads to reduced cerebral perfusion. A bolus intravenous dose of 10 or 20 mg of furosemide can be administered and then followed by intravenous bolus of 2 or 3% hypertonic saline to increase the serum sodium level.
* Pulmonary edema - Slow intravenous bolus dose of 40 to 80 mg furosemide at 4 mg per minute is indicated for patients with fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Such dose can be repeated after 20 minutes. After the bolus, a continuous intravenous infusion can be given at 5 to 10 mg per hour. For those with underlying renal impairment or severe heart failure, up to 160 to 200 mg bolus dose can be given.
* Hypertension - A systematic review by the Cochrane Hypertension group assessing the anti-hypertensive effects of loop diuretics found only a modest reduction in blood pressure when compared to placebo. According to Joint National Committee (JNC-8) guidelines, the first line treatment of hypertension is thiazide diuretics. The use of loop diuretics is not mentioned in this guideline. Meanwhile, according to 2013 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, a loop diuretic can only replace thiazide-type diuretics if there is renal impairment (Creatinine of more than 1.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 due to lack of long term cardiovascular outcome data and appropriate dosing regimen of its use.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines stated that diuretics should not be used to treat acute kidney injury, except for the management of volume overload. Diuretics has not shown any benefits of preventing or treating acute kidney injury.

They are also sometimes used in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.

== Resistance ==
Diuretic resistance is defined as failure of diuretics to reduce fluid retention (can be measured by low urinary sodium) despite using the maximal dose of drugs. There are various causes for the resistance towards loop diuretics. After initial period of diuresis, there will be a period of &quot;post-diuretic sodium retention&quot; where the rate of sodium excretion does not reach as much as the initial diuresis period. Increase intake of sodium during this period will offset the amount of excreted sodium, and thus causing diuretic resistance. Prolonged usage of loop diuretics will also contributes to resistance through &quot;braking phenomenon&quot;. This is the body physiological response to reduced extracellular fluid volume, where renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system will be activated which results in nephron remodelling. Nephron remodeling increases the number of distal convoluted cells, principle cells, and intercalated cells. These cells have sodium-chloride symporter at distal convoluted tubule, epithelial sodium channels, and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin. This will promote sodium reabsorption and fluid retention, causing diuretic resistance. Other factors includes gut edema which slows down the absorption of oral loop diuretics. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces renal flow rate, reducing the delivery of diuretic molecules into the nephron, limiting sodium excretion and increasing sodium retention, causing diuretic resistance. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can compete with loop diuretics for organic ion transporters, thus preventing the diuretic molecules from being secreted into the proximal convoluted tubules.

Those with diuretic resistance, cardiorenal syndrome, and severe right ventricular dysfunction may have better response to continuous diuretic infusion. Diuretic dosages is adjusted to produce 3 to 5 litres of urine per day. Thiazide (blockade of sodium-chloride symporter), amiloride (blockade of epithelial sodium channels) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (blockade of chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin) has been suggested to complement the action of loop diuretics in resistance cases but limited evidence are available to support their use.

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dose-related and arise from the effect of loop diuretics on diuresis and electrolyte balance.

Common ADRs include: hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, dehydration, hyperuricemia, gout, dizziness, postural hypotension, syncope. The loss of magnesium as a result of loop diuretics has also been suggested as a possible cause of pseudogout (chondrocalcinosis).

Infrequent ADRs include: dyslipidemia, increased serum creatinine concentration, hypocalcemia, rash. Metabolic alkalosis may also be seen with loop diuretic use.

Ototoxicity (damage to the inner ear) is a serious, but rare ADR associated with use of loop diuretics. This may be limited to tinnitus and vertigo, but may result in deafness in serious cases.

Loop diuretics may also precipitate kidney failure in patients concurrently taking an NSAID and an ACE inhibitor—the so-called &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect.

Because furosemide, torsemide and bumetanide are technically sulfa drugs, there is a theoretical risk that patients sensitive to sulfonamides may be sensitive to these loop diuretics. This risk is stated on drug packaging inserts. However, the actual risk of crossreactivity is largely unknown and there are some sources that dispute the existence of such cross reactivity. In one study it was found that only 10% of patients with allergy to antibiotic sulfonamides were also allergic to diuretic sulfonamides, but it is unclear if this represents true cross reactivity or the nature of being prone to allergy.

Ethacrynic acid is the only medication of this class that is not a sulfonamide. It carries a greater risk of reversible or permanent hearing loss (ototoxicity), and has a distinct complication of being associated with gastrointestinal toxicity.

<doc id="973594" wikidata="Q318303" url="?curid=973594" title="Jacopo Riccati">
<text>Jacopo Francesco Riccati (28 May 1676 – 15 April 1754) was a Venetian mathematician and jurist from Venice. He is best known for having studied the equation that bears his name.

==Education==
Riccati was educated first at the Jesuit school for the nobility in Brescia, and in 1693 he entered the University of Padua to study law. He received a doctorate in law (LL.D.) in 1696. Encouraged by Stefano degli Angeli to pursue mathematics, he studied mathematical analysis.

==Career==
Riccati received various academic offers but declined them in order to devote his full attention to the study of mathematical analysis on his own. Peter the Great invited him to Russia as president of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. He was also invited to Vienna as an imperial councillor and was offered a professorship at the University of Padua. He declined all these offers.

He was often consulted by the Senate of Venice on the construction of canals and dikes along rivers.

Some of his work on polynomials was included by Maria Gaetana Agnesi, at Riccati&#x27;s request, in the book on integral calculus of her &quot;Analytical Institutions&quot;.

The Riccati equation is named after him.

==Personal life==
His father, Conte Montino Riccati, came from a noble family who owned land near Venice. His mother was from the powerful Colonna family. His father died in 1686, when Riccati was only ten, leaving the youth a handsome estate.

Jacopo&#x27;s son, Vincenzo Riccati, a Jesuit, followed his father&#x27;s footsteps and pioneered the development of hyperbolic functions.

A second son, Giordano Riccati was the first to measure the ratio of Young&#x27;s moduli of metals—preceding the better known Thomas Young by 25 years.

==Honors==
Jacopo Riccati was named honorary Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1723.

<text>Dunwich Records was an independent American record label started by Bill Traut, Eddie Higgins and George Badonsky in Chicago in 1965. Dunwich was also a production company which licensed recordings to other labels, including Atlantic, Atco, Columbia, Mercury and SGC. The label was primarily known for the release of singles from the emerging Chicago rock scene in the 1960s. Only two artists, the Shadows of Knight and Amanda Ambrose, released albums on the label.

==History==
Traut, Higgins and Badonsky formed their first record label, Amboy, in 1963 and released recordings of themselves and other bands. In 1965 they changed the label&#x27;s name to Dunwich, and in December released a cover version of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; by the Chicago band Shadows of Knight. By the spring of 1966, the song was a hit. After some difficulty with nationwide distribution, Traut, Higgins and Badonsky made a distribution deal with Atlantic subsidiary Atco Records. By mid-1967 Traut and Badonsky bought out Higgins. Dunwich soon stopped releasing their own records, concentrating instead on producing a range of artists and leasing the master recordings to other labels. The Dunwich lute player logo appears on these recordings. Above the lute player is a cartoon type word balloon that says &quot;It&#x27;s DUNWICH, man.&quot; This logo may have been on a few other Chicago groups records, such as &quot;The Cryan Shames&quot; Columbia albums.

In the spring of 1968, Traut split with Badonsky, joined with producers Jim Golden and Bob Monaco and reorganized Dunwich Records into Dunwich Productions, Ltd. The three continued to produce Chicago-based groups, notably the bands Mason Proffit and Coven. The latter group released their first album in 1969 on the Mercury label, but with the Dunwich Productions logo. In 1971, Traut briefly revived the Dunwich label for a live recording of Chicago folk artists, &quot;Gathering at the Earl of Old Town&quot;, which notably includes the first recording of late singer-songwriter Steve Goodman performing &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;. 
The Dunwich label was eventually absorbed by its distributor, Atco, which issued two final Shadows of Knight singles bearing the Dunwich logo, but issued on the Atco label. In 1971, Traut and Golden joined with Jerry Weintraub to form Wooden Nickel Records, whose early acts included the band Styx.

Since the Dunwich label released mostly singles, two collections released by Sundazed Music in the 1990s are considered to be quite important to appreciating the history of Dunwich Records and its contribution to music. &quot;Oh Yeah! The Best of Dunwich Records, Volume 1&quot;, was released in 1991. This was followed by &quot;If You&#x27;re Ready! The Best of Dunwich Records, Volume 2&quot;, in 1994. Artists appearing on these records include The Shadows of Knight, The Knaves, The Pride &amp; Joy, The Luv&#x27;d Ones, Saturday&#x27;s Children, The Wanderin&#x27; Kind, The Rovin&#x27; Kind, The American Breed, the H. P. Lovecraft band, Sounds Unlimited, The Del Vetts, The Warner Brothers and Little Boy Blues. The albums were produced by Bill Traut and George Badonsky. An earlier collection of Dunwich singles had been released in 1971 on the Happy Tiger label as &quot;Early Chicago, Volume 1&quot;.

The label&#x27;s name &quot;Dunwich&quot; refers to &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, a story by H. P. Lovecraft, The label&#x27;s publishing arm, Yuggoth Music, was named after a fictional planet in Lovecraft&#x27;s stories.

<text>Charles Arthur &quot;Charlie&quot; Bassett II (December 30, 1931 – February 28, 1966) (Major, USAF) was an American electrical engineer and United States Air Force test pilot. He went to Ohio State University for two years and later graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. He joined the Air Force as a pilot and graduated from both the Air Force&#x27;s Experimental Test Pilot School and the Aerospace Research Pilot School. Bassett was married and had two children.

He was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1963 and was assigned to &quot;Gemini 9&quot;. He died in an airplane crash during training for his first spaceflight. He is memorialized on the Space Mirror Memorial; The Astronaut Monument; and the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; memorial plaque, which was placed on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission.

== Early life and education ==
Bassett was born on December 30, 1931, in Dayton, Ohio, to Charles Arthur &quot;Pete&quot; Bassett (1897–1957) and Fannie Belle Milby Bassett ( James; 1907–1993). Bassett was active in the Boy Scouts of America, where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. During high school, Bassett was a model plane aficionado. He belonged to a club that built gasoline-powered models and flew them in the school gym. Bassett&#x27;s interest in model airplanes translated to real aircraft; he made his first solo flight at age 16. He worked odd jobs at the airport to earn money for flying lessons and earned his private pilot license at age seventeen.

After graduating from Berea High School, in Berea, in 1950, he attended Ohio State University, in Columbus, from 1950 to 1952. Midway through college in 1952, Bassett enrolled in Air Force ROTC; he entered the U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in October of that year. He attended Texas Technological College, now Texas Tech University, from 1958 to 1960. He received a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in electrical engineering from Texas Tech and did graduate work at University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.

== Military service ==

He started his career with training at Stallings Air Base, North Carolina, and Bryan Air Force Base, Texas. Bassett graduated from Bryan in December 1953 and was commissioned in the Air Force. He arrived for additional training in Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, as a second lieutenant. There, he flew trainer aircraft, such as the T-6, the T-28, and the T-33, and flew the jet fighter F-86 Sabre in 1954.

He went to Korea with the 8th Fighter Bomber Group and flew a F-86 Sabre. Bassett was too late to fly any combat missions, and said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t have any challenge, you never know how good you are.&quot; Bassett was promoted to first lieutenant in May 1955. He returned from Korea in 1955 and was assigned to Suffolk County Air Force Base, in New York, flying aircraft such as the F-86D, the F-102, and the C-119.

In November 1960, Bassett went to Maxwell Air Force Base, in Alabama, to attend Squadron Officer School. He also graduated from the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62A) and the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class III) and was promoted to captain. Bassett was an experimental test pilot and engineering test pilot in the Fighter Projects Office at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and logged over 3,600 hours of flying time, including over 2,900 hours in a jet aircraft.

== NASA career ==
Bassett was one of NASA&#x27;s third group of astronauts, named in October 1963. In addition to participating in the overall astronaut training program, he had specific responsibilities related to training and simulators. On November 8, 1965, he was selected as pilot of the Gemini 9 mission with Elliot See as command pilot. Bassett was scheduled to make an untethered ninety-minute spacewalk, which was undertaken by Gene Cernan on Gemini 9A.

According to chief astronaut Deke Slayton&#x27;s autobiography, he chose Bassett for Gemini 9 because he was &quot;strong enough to carry&quot; both himself and See. Slayton had also assigned Bassett as command module pilot for the second backup Apollo crew, alongside Frank Borman and William Anders.

== Personal life ==
On June 22, 1955, Bassett married Jeannie Martin. They had two children.

== Death ==
Bassett and Elliot See died on February 28, 1966, when their T-38 trainer jet, piloted by See, crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, known as the McDonnell Space Center, from Lambert Field airport in St. Louis, Missouri. Building 101 was where the Gemini spacecraft was built, and the two astronauts were going there that Monday morning to train for two weeks in a simulator. They died within of their spacecraft.

Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the crash. See was thrown clear of the cockpit and was found in the parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat with the parachute partially open. Bassett was decapitated on impact; his severed head was found later in the day in the rafters of the damaged assembly building.

Both men&#x27;s remains were buried in Arlington National Cemetery on Friday, March 4. During funeral services in Texas two days earlier, astronauts Jim McDivitt and Jim Lovell and civilian pilot Jere Cobb flew the missing man formation in Bassett&#x27;s honor, while Buzz Aldrin, Bill Anders, and Walter Cunningham did the same to honor See.

A NASA investigative panel later concluded that pilot error, caused by poor visibility due to bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low to the ground during his second approach, probably because of the poor visibility.

== Memorials ==

Bassett is honored at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center&#x27;s Space Mirror Memorial, alongside 24 other NASA astronauts who died in the pursuit of space exploration.

His name also appears on the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; memorial plaque at Hadley Rille on the Moon, placed by the Apollo 15 mission in 1971. Texas Tech University dedicated an Electrical Engineering Research Laboratory building in Bassett&#x27;s honor in November 1996.

<text>Malet Street is a street in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden, Central London, England. It runs between Torrington Place and the British Museum, parallel to Gower Street and Tottenham Court Road.

==History==
The street is named after Sir Edward Malet who was married to Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford who owned much of the surrounding area.

==Buildings==
It is a small street, but is notable for being the location of Senate House, the main building of the University of London, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Birkbeck Central (formerly Student Central London, and before that the University of London Union), College Hall and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Birkbeck, University of London is also on the street, though its entrance is now in Torrington Square.

In 1938, the Institute of Education moved from Southampton Row to the University of London Senate House complex on Malet Street.

<text>Dublin Zoo (), in Phoenix Park, is a zoo in Dublin, Ireland, and one of Dublin&#x27;s most popular attractions. Established and designed in 1830 by Decimus Burton, it opened the following year. Today it focuses on conservation projects, breeding programmes, and growing awareness for animals. Its stated mission is to &quot;work in partnership with zoos worldwide to make a significant contribution to the conservation of the endangered species on Earth&quot;.

Covering over of Phoenix Park, the zoo is divided into habitats including the Himalayan Hills, Wolves in the Woods, the African Savanna, Kaziranga Forest Trail, South American House, Zoorassic World, Gorilla Rainforest, Orangutan Forest, Sea Lion Cove, and Family Farm (as of July 2022). Overall the zoo houses about 400 animals across 100 species and attracts over one million visitors each year.

==History==

===19th century===
The Royal Zoological Society of Dublin was established at a meeting held at the Rotunda Hospital on 10 May 1830 and the zoo, then called the Zoological Gardens Dublin, was opened to the public on 1 September 1831. The animals, 46 mammals and 72 birds, were donated by London Zoo and Royal Menagerie of the Tower of London.
Initially, the entrance fee was one shilling. What made Dublin Zoo very different from some of its contemporaries was a decision to reduce the charge to one penny on Sundays. This choice made the Zoo popular among the less wealthy.

In 1833, the original cottage-style entrance lodge to the zoo was built at a cost of £30 and in early days also housed staff. The thatch-roofed building is still visible to the right of the current entrance. In 1838, to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria, the zoo held an open day – 20,000 people visited, which is still the highest number of visitors in one day.

In 1844 the zoo received its first giraffe, and in 1855 it bought its first pair of lions which bred for the first time in 1857. After leaving office, President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant was among the celebrities who came to see Dublin&#x27;s world-famous lions in the 19th century. Reptiles got their own house in 1876 and the first tearooms were built in 1898.

===20th century===
Zoo employee Christopher Flood&#x27;s son Jack stayed in the zoo during the 1916 Easter Rising to care for the animals with two other young keepers, dealing with food shortages for the animals amongst other problems. He died shortly after from the Spanish flu in his twenties.

On 9 June 1903, an elephant named Sita killed her keeper while he nursed her injured foot. She was put down by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Times of trouble and war also caused problems for the zoo. Meat ran out during the Easter Rising of 1916. In order to keep the lions and tigers alive, some of the other animals in the zoo were killed. A lion named Slats was born at the zoo on 20 March 1919, and was one of many lions filmed by the Hollywood movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1928 to be used as their mascot Leo.

Between 1989 and 1990, the financial situation at the zoo became so serious that the council considered closing it. The Government then gave it a meaningful annual grant in line with what happens in other European countries. Thirteen hectares () of land surrounding the lake in the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin were added in 1997. This made a profound improvement in the amount of space available for the animals.

===21st century===
In 2002, a twenty-eight-year-old hippo named Linda was thrown a tennis ball by a visitor. While she caught the ball, it became lodged in her intestines and she died soon after.

In 2005, the Kaziranga Forest Trail was opened. It is now home to eleven Asian elephants; Bernhardine, Yasmin, Asha and Anak, the four mature females. Kavi, Ashoka and Samiya the five-year-old calves, and the newest additions, Zinda, Avani, Kabir and Sanjay.

In 2009, the African Savannah was opened in the African Plains section of the zoo. It is now home to species such as the giraffe, zebra, ostrich, scimitar-horned oryx, and southern white rhino.

In 2010, Dublin Zoo received 963,053 visitors. In 2015, Dublin Zoo was the third most popular visitor attraction in Ireland with 1,105,005 visitors.
The year 2015 also saw the death of the well-known and loved silverback western lowland gorilla Harry. During his life at Dublin Zoo, Harry produced many offspring; thus contributing greatly to the conservation of his species.

The documentary TV series &quot;The Zoo&quot; produced by Moondance Productions is filmed almost entirely on location at Dublin Zoo, and began broadcast on TV3 in 2010, before moving to RTÉ One in Ireland in 2011. It is also broadcast on VRT in Belgium since 2011 and on Discovery Animal Planet in the UK since 2012.

In November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the public donated over 2 million euro in two days to the zoo to support it. 

In Seanad Éireann in July 2022, Annie Hoey reported allegations from whistleblowers of the mistreatment since 2016 of terminally ill animals, including Harry the gorilla, and of the escape or loss since 2019 of two Celebes crested macaques, a white-collared mangabey, and a citron-crested cockatoo. The zoo said it &quot;vehemently disputes&quot; the allegations.

==Animals and exhibits==
As the result of protests against the standard of animal housing and welfare, led by former keeper Brendan Price, a &quot;Plan for the Future of Dublin Zoo&quot; was prepared by the Zoological Society of Ireland and the Office of Public Works. In 1994 it was presented to Minister of Finance Bertie Ahern. The government granted the zoo IR£15 million (€28 million, adjusted to 2017 inflation levels) for improvements. Themed areas were decided on and the first, World of Primates, opened to the public in 1996. The latest, African Plains, opened in 2001.

===African Plains===

African Plains is an Africa-themed area that covers 13 hectares and was opened in 2001. The main exhibit in African Plains is the &quot;African Savanna&quot;, which houses ostriches, scimitar-horned oryx, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild&#x27;s giraffes and Grant&#x27;s zebras, all of which share a large, outdoor paddock. Gorilla Rainforest, an exhibit opened in 2012, houses a troop of western lowland gorillas: a silverback male named Bangui, two adult females named Kafi and Vana, and two young females named Asali and Kambiri, both of which were born in 2011 and 2019 respectively.

Other animals displayed in the African Plains area include chimpanzees, hippopotamus, sooty mangabeys, African spurred tortoises, Abyssinian ground hornbills, red river hogs, okapis, eastern bongo and a new Cheetah. The area also features an Africa-themed restaurant (named the Nakuru Restaurant) and a gift shop. The zoo&#x27;s last African lion died in 2012, so the zoo later received three Asiatic lions. A baby scimitar-horned oryx was born in December 2016.

===Wolves in the Woods===
Wolves in the Woods is an exhibition housing grey wolves.

===Himalayan Hills===

Themed after a Nepalese village, Himalayan Hills houses snow leopards and red pandas, two species that inhabit the Himalayas.

===Zoorassic World (reptiles)===
Dublin Zoo&#x27;s Reptile House was opened in 1876. In July 2017 Zoorassic World was opened as the new home for the reptiles of the zoo, located in Roberts House. Also included is a T.Rex fossil replica.

===Asian Forests===

Asian Forests was originally opened in 1998, under the name &quot;World of Cats&quot;. The exhibit consists of four enclosures, one housing Asiatic lions and designed to resemble the Gir forest in India, the second housing Sulawesi crested macaques designed to look like the rainforests in Sulawesi, Indonesia, the third housing Amur tigers designed to resemble the forests of Amur in Russia, China and North Korea and the fourth housing dholes designed to imitate the Indian and South Asian forests.

===The Kaziranga Forest Trail===

Opened in June 2007, the Kaziranga Forest Trail is Dublin Zoo&#x27;s Asian elephant enclosure and is named after the Kaziranga National Park in India. The zoo is home to 11 elephants, including two adult females named Bernhardine and Yasmin, two younger females named Asha (Bernhardine&#x27;s daughter) and Anak (Yasmin&#x27;s daughter) and a bull named Upali. Upali left in 2019 for Le Pal zoo in France.

The enclosure features a waterfall and two pools for the elephants, as well as sheltered viewing areas and a children&#x27;s playground for visitors, and the elephants share their enclosure with a breeding pair of blackbuck. It is also home to two young male elephants named Kavi and Ashoka who were born on 17 July and 19 August 2014 and a young female Samiya who was born on 17 September 2014. The Kaziranga Forest Trail most recently became home to two female calves, Zinda born on 19 September 2016 and Avani born on 13 March 2017 and two male calves, Kabir, born on 15 May 2017 and Sanjay, born on 10 February 2018.

===South American House===
Dublin Zoo&#x27;s South American House has various species from Central and South America, including golden lion tamarins, Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets, Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, military macaws, white-faced sakis, painted wood turtles and pygmy marmosets.

===World of Primates===
The World of Primates houses contain various species of apes and monkeys. The exhibit opened to the public in 1996. The area comprises a string of man-made islands in a natural lake. The islands range in size from 15 to 30 square metres and are linked by wooden bridges to sleeping quarters on the lake shore.

Some of the islands have climbing frames available for all the animals present in this location. Areas of each island have been sectioned off with hot-wire to facilitate the growth of vegetation and give each island a more natural appearance. On some islands, areas of foraging substrate, such as bark, have been provided to facilitate scatter feeding.

The provision of large viewing windows in the sleeping quarters gives the public access to what is generally an off-show area in many zoos. However, there are areas where the animals can hide from the public in order to receive privacy.
The islands mentioned above are inhabited by siamangs, red ruffed lemurs, ring-tailed lemurs, spider monkeys, and Celebes crested macaques. Each species has unlimited access to its outdoor enclosures both day and night all year round. The zoo has succeeded in breeding the primates on these islands. The Celebes crested macaque group have done exceptionally well since their introduction to the island, and success has also been achieved with the lemurs and siamangs.

In early 2008, an orangutan escaped her enclosure. She had escaped for an hour and was on top of the Sumatran tiger night house before a group of school children alerted staff. That same year, an orangutan named Jorong was seen rescuing an injured moorhen chick from a pond, &quot;patiently coaxing the bird ashore with a leaf before gently lifting it onto grass&quot;; the rescue became known to the wider public in June 2011, when a four-minute video of the event was posted to YouTube.

===Family Farm===

Family Farm (formerly known as City Farm) originally opened in 1999, and re-developed in 2010. The area is designed to teach the public about modern Irish farming, and is a joint venture between Dublin Zoo and Agri Aware, a charitable trust that works to improve the image and understanding of Ireland&#x27;s farming and food industry amongst the general public.

Domestic livestock kept in Family Farm include Greyface Dartmoor sheep, Cheviot sheep, pygmy goats, Tamworth pigs named Rose and Ginger, Australorp chickens, call ducks, Indian Runner ducks, Simmental cows, a white rabbit named Roger and a Holstein Friesian cow named Bella.

=== Sea Lion Cove ===
President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins opened the new Sea Lion Cove habitat in June 2015. Sea Lion Cove is home to the colony of California sea lions, three females, Cassie, Florence and Seanna, and one male, Nico. The new saltwater habitat is the biggest and most exciting development undertaken by Dublin Zoo in recent years. It is inspired by the natural environment of the California sea lions and it includes a state-of-the-art water filtration plant.

===Nocturnal House===
A nocturnal house opened in July 2023 near Sea Lion cove, to accommodate nocturnal Aye-Aye lemurs, transferred from Bristol Zoo. Aye-Aye are endangered on the IUCN red list.

===Other animals===
Other animals in Dublin Zoo&#x27;s collection that are not part of a specific themed area include, Chilean flamingos, meerkats, red pandas, South American tapirs, little egrets and waldrapp ibises.

==Conservation==

The zoo is part of a worldwide programme to breed endangered species. It is a member of the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), which helps the conservation of endangered species in Europe. Each species supervised by the EEP has a single coordinator that is responsible for the building of breeding groups with the aim of obtaining a genetically balanced population. In November 2023 the Zoo opened the National Centre for Species Survival in partnership with the IUCN, in the renovated Society House, beside the Meerkat Restaurant.

Dublin Zoo manages the EEP for the golden lion tamarin and the Moluccan cockatoo. It also houses members of the species Goeldi&#x27;s monkey and the white-faced saki which are part of EEPs coordinated by other zoos. The focus is on conservation, which includes breeding and protecting endangered species, as well as research, study and education.

===Rodrigues fruit bats===
Rodrigues fruit bats are one of Dublin Zoo&#x27;s endangered species. Fruit bats, as their name suggests, feed on fruit and because of that are very important to the rainforest. Bats cannot digest the seeds and pips of the fruit that they eat and so the seeds leave the bat&#x27;s digestive system &quot;wrapped&quot; in fertilizer. Without bats, many rainforest trees would not be able to sow their own seeds.

Dublin Zoo has recently completed a larger Asian elephant enclosure (complete with Asian rainforest) and the Nesbit House (bat house) has been demolished. The Rodrigues fruit bats are now in the Roberts House (or bird house), which is located beside the ring-tailed lemurs.

===Golden lion tamarins===
This tiny monkey, named for the long gold-coloured hair around its head which resembles a lion&#x27;s mane, is one of the rarest primates in the world. Golden lion tamarins, like many of the other tamarins found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study tamarins in Brazil.

The forests that golden lion tamarins need in order to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or &#x27;pockets&#x27; of forest are left but these are too small for the tamarins to survive in. In the past, tamarins were collected for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories. The golden lion tamarins are located in the South American house.

===Moluccan cockatoos===
Dublin Zoo holds the European studbook for Moluccan cockatoos. A studbook is a record of all the individuals of a particular species that are held in zoos in a region. It contains information such as the sex of the animal, how old it is and who its parents were. This information is then used to decide which birds should be paired with which to get the best genetic mix. This ensures that the captive population stays as genetically healthy as possible. Moluccan cockatoos are handsome birds, white-with-a-hint-of-pink feathers and a pink colour on the crest. This cockatoo is on the endangered species list.

<text>Edward Kynaston (c. 1640 – January 1706) was an English actor, one of the last Restoration &quot;boy players&quot;, young male actors who played women&#x27;s roles.

==Career==
Kynaston was good looking and made a convincing woman: Samuel Pepys called him &quot;the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life&quot; after seeing him in a production of John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Loyal Subject&quot; at the Cockpit-in-Court, &quot;only her voice [is] not very good&quot;. He also played the title role in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot;. Pepys had dinner with Kynaston after this production on 18 August 1660.

Simultaneously, Kynaston played male roles as well. He filled the role of Otto in &quot;Rollo Duke of Normandy&quot; on 6 December 1660, having played the female role of Arthiope in the same play in previous weeks. On 7 January 1661, Kynaston played three roles in a performance of Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot;, one female and two male.

Part of Kynaston&#x27;s appeal may have been his ambiguous sexuality. The actor Colley Cibber recalled: &quot;the Ladies of Quality prided themselves in taking him with them in their Coaches to Hyde-Park in his Theatrical Habit, after the Play.&quot;
Cibber also reported that a performance of a tragedy attended by Charles II was once delayed because, as someone explained, Kynaston, who was playing the Queen, &quot;was not shav&#x27;d&quot;.

In the 1660s women were permitted to appear on stage and male actors playing female roles in serious drama was strongly discouraged. Kynaston&#x27;s last female role was as Evadne in Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; with Thomas Killigrew&#x27;s King&#x27;s Company in 1661. 

Described by Samuel Pepys as &quot;the prettiest woman in the whole house&quot; and &quot;the handsomest man&quot;, the rumour of the time had him playing female roles off stage as well. When already in his thirties, lampoons circulated that made him out to be the lover of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.

Kynaston went on to make a successful career in male roles and was noted for his portrayal of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;. He retired in 1699.

==Fictional portrayals==
Kynaston is played by Billy Crudup in the 2004 film &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; directed by Sir Richard Eyre. He is represented as a foppish bisexual, who slowly reveals more complexity in his personality and sexuality. The film is an adaptation of the play &quot;Compleat Female Stage Beauty&quot; by Jeffrey Hatcher. In 2012, the Houston Grand Opera announced a new opera by Carlisle Floyd with Kynaston as the protagonist: it premiered in March 2016. He also appeared as a character in &quot;Nell Gwynn&quot;, played by Greg Haiste in the premiere production in 2015.

<doc id="973614" wikidata="Q2238935" url="?curid=973614" title="Slighting">
<text>Slighting is the deliberate damage of high-status buildings to reduce their value as military, administrative or social structures. This destruction of property is sometimes extended to the contents of buildings and the surrounding landscape. It is a phenomenon with complex motivations and was often used as a tool of control. Slighting spanned cultures and periods, with especially well-known examples from the English Civil War in the 17th century.

==Meaning and use==
Slighting is the act of deliberately damaging a high-status building, especially a castle or fortification, which could include its contents and the surrounding area. The first recorded use of the word &quot;slighting&quot; to mean a form of destruction was in 1613. Castles are complex structures combining military, social, and administrative uses, and the decision to slight them took these various roles into account. The purpose of slighting was to reduce the value of the building, whether military, social, or administrative. Destruction often went beyond what was needed to prevent an enemy from using the fortification, indicating the damage was important symbolically. When Eccleshall Castle in Staffordshire was slighted as a result of the English Civil War, the act was politically motivated.

In some cases, it was used as a way of punishing the king&#x27;s rebels or was used to undermine the authority of the owner by demonstrating his inability to protect his property. As part of the peace negotiations bringing The Anarchy of 1135–1154 to an end, both sides agreed to dismantle fortifications built since the start of the conflict. Similarly, in 1317 Edward II ordered the dismantling of Harbottle Castle in Northumberland in England as part of a treaty with Robert the Bruce.

In England, Scotland, and Wales, it was uncommon for someone to slight his own fortifications but not unknown; during the First War of Scottish Independence, Robert the Bruce systematically slighted Scottish castles, often after capturing them from English control. More than a century earlier, John, King of England, ordered the demolition of Château de Montrésor in France, during his war with the French king over control of Normandy. In the Levant, Muslim rulers adopted a policy of slighting castles and fortified towns and cities to deny them to Crusaders; Sultan Baybars, for example, instigated the destruction of fortifications at Jaffa in 1267, Antioch in 1268, and Ashkelon in 1270.

==Methods of destruction==
Castles were demolished with a range of methods, each affecting the buildings in different ways. Fire might be used, especially against timber structures; digging underneath stone structures (known as undermining) could cause them to collapse; dismantling a structure by hand was sometimes done, but was time- and labour-intensive, as was filling ditches and digging away earthworks; and in later periods gunpowder was sometimes used. Manually dismantling a castle (&quot;picking&quot;) can be split into two categories: primary damage where the intention was to slight the castle; and secondary damage which was incidental through activity such as retrieving reusable materials.

Undermining involved digging underneath a wall or removing stones at its base. When successful, the tunnel or cavity would collapse, making it difficult to identify through archaeology. Archaeological investigations have identified 61 castles that were slighted in the Middle Ages, and only five were undermined. While surviving mines are rare, one was discovered in the 1930s during excavations at Bungay Castle in Suffolk. It probably dates from around 1174 when the owner rebelled against Henry II.

==The effect of slighting==

Dismantling a castle was a skilled process, and stone, metal, and glass were sometimes removed for sale or reuse. After the castle at Papowo Biskupie in Poland was slighted, some of the materials from the castle were used to build a seminary at nearby Chełmża.

The impact of slighting ranged from almost complete destruction of a site, as can be seen at Deganwy Castle, to a token gesture, for example damaging elements such as arrowslits. In 1268, the court of King Louis IX of France gave orders to slight a new fortification near Étampes, specifying that the bailiff carrying out orders should &quot;destroy the arrow-slits and so to break them through that it may be abundantly clear that the fortification has been slighted&quot;.

Destruction was often carefully targeted rather than indiscriminate, even when carried out on a large scale. In cases of medieval slighting, domestic areas such as free-standing halls and chapels were typically excluded from the destruction.

When King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland gave the order to slight the castle at Mała Nieszawka, after negotiation with the Teutonic Order who owned the castle, one of the conditions was that the buildings in the outer bailey would be left intact while the walls were reduced in height. In 1648, Parliament gave orders to slight Bolsover Castle but that &quot;so much only be done to it as to make it untenable as a garrison and that it may not be unnecessarily spoiled and defaced.&quot; When a castle had a keep, it was usually the most visible part of the castle and a focus of symbolism. This would sometimes attract the attention of people carrying out slighting. Kenilworth was one of many castles to be slighted during the English Civil War, and the side of the keep most visible to people outside the castle was demolished.

Documentary sources for the medieval period typically have little information on what slighting involved, so archaeology helps to understand which areas of buildings were targeted and how they were demolished. For the English Civil War, destruction accounts are rare but there are some instances such as Sheffield Castle where detailed records survive. At Sheffield military and social concerns combined: there may have been a desire to prevent the Royalist owner from using the fortification against Parliament, and the destruction undermined the owner&#x27;s authority. Despite this, the profits from the demolition went to the owner, contrasting with Pontefract Castle, where the money went to the townspeople.

When castles were slighted in the Middle Ages this often led to their complete abandonment, but some were repaired and others reused. This was also the case with places slighted as a result of the English Civil War. In 1650, Parliament gave orders to slight Wressle Castle in East Yorkshire; the south part of the castle was left standing so that the owner could still use it as a manor house. Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire was also slighted in the same period – meaning that a small but significant part of the curtain wall was demolished, but the remaining structure was left intact, and the castle remains inhabited to this day.

The use of destruction both to control and to subvert control spans periods and cultures. Slighting was prevalent in the Middle Ages and the 17th century; notable episodes include The Anarchy, the English Civil War, and France in the 16th and 17th centuries, as well as Japan. The ruins left by the destruction of castles in 17th-century England and Wales encouraged the later Romantic movement.

<text>The Škoda Superb is a mid-size/large family car (D-segment) that has been produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto since 2001. The first generation of the modern Superb, produced from 2001 to 2008, was based on the VW B5 PL45+ platform. The second generation Superb used the B6 A6/PQ46 and was introduced in 2008. The third generation using the MQB platform entered production in 2015. The fourth and current generation was unveiled on 2023 and it is based on a stretched version of the MQB Evo platform.

==First generation (B5, &quot;Typ&quot; 3U; 2001)==



===History===
In 2001, Škoda Auto presented the &quot;Montreux&quot; concept car at the Geneva International Motor Show, with the production version being released the same year as the Superb.

The first generation of the modern Škoda Superb was based on the 1999 Shanghai–Volkswagen Passat B5 LWB, which has a longer wheelbase than the standard Passat B5 and used the Volkswagen Group B5 PL45+ platform. In 2005, Shanghai-Volkswagen imported the Superb, rebadging it as the Volkswagen Passat Lingyu.

In 2009, one year after the B5 generation had been discontinued in Europe, the facelifted Volkswagen Passat Lingyu was unveiled in China. In 2011, the Volkswagen Passat Lingyu was discontinued, succeeded by the Passat NMS.

Several petrol and diesel internal combustion engines are shared with the rest of the Volkswagen Group range; and like the B5 Passat and B6/B7 Audi A4 which use the same automobile platform, they are mounted at the front, and orientated longitudinally.

The base model, the &#x27;Classic&#x27;, included the 1.9 litre inline four cylinder (I4) Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel producing , or a 2.0 litre petrol inline four rated at . The &#x27;Comfort&#x27; and &#x27;Elegance&#x27; models offered with a 1.8 twenty valve Turbo petrol I4 rated at , or either a V6 2.8 litre petrol engine, or a 2.5 litre V6 TDI rated at .

Transmissions included a five speed or a six speed manual gearbox, or a ZF sourced five speed tiptronic automatic. In addition to the 1.9 litre &quot;Pumpe Düse&quot; (PD) Unit Injector engine, the Superb eventually gained the 2.0 litre TDI PD (BSS). This was an 8V single camshaft engine based on the 1.9 litre TDI that was unique to the Superb with two main differences over the 1.9 litre TDI. The BSS engine shared the same twin balance shaft oil pump used in the 16V twin camshaft 2.0 litre TDI PD engine that can be found in various Audi models. It also featured a wet DPF that used fluid contained in a tank under the spare wheel to generate heat for regeneration. This was used over a standard dry DPF due to space limitations in the engine bay.

The Superb received a minor facelift in August 2006 incorporating Škoda&#x27;s new radiator grille, headlights, side repeater indicators integrated into the door mirrors, and C-shaped tail lights in the style of Škoda Roomster and second-gen Škoda Octavia.

An interior redesign completed the upgrades. A &#x27;Laurin and Klement&#x27; model became the top of the range, replacing the &#x27;Elegance&#x27; model. A range of new engines was introduced and the interior featured real wood as part of some trim levels. The &#x27;Comfort&#x27;, &#x27;Elegance&#x27; and &#x27;Laurin &amp; Klement&#x27; models feature an umbrella stowed in the rear door panel. It was also the first Škoda to be available with an optional CD navigation system called the DX, with that option you automatically got the more powerful Sound System with 8 speakers, DSP amplifier, more DSP effects in the audio settings such as Sound Focus, Genre based EQ, more advanced speed-sensitive volume control and a 6-CD changer.

Škoda considered a station wagon version of the Superb. However, it was never put in production, the reason being Volkswagen feared that such a version would take too much market share from its own Passat &quot;Variant&quot; and Audi&#x27;s A4 &quot;Avant&quot;. When the Superb was released in the United Kingdom in May 2002, the most expensive variant was priced at only £1,000 more than the cheapest Jaguar X-Type.

==Second generation (B6, &quot;Typ&quot; 3T; 2008)==



An all new Škoda Superb (B6, Typ 3T) was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in early March 2008.

Based on a stretched version of the latest A5 Octavia platform, the Volkswagen Group A6 PQ46, this Superb is a four door five seat sedan, with an innovative &quot;TwinDoor&quot; trunk lid that can operate as a conventional trunk or as a hatchback that includes opening with the rear glass.

Being based on the Octavia A5 platform, this Superb now uses a transverse engine layout. A Superb Combi – five door estate with 633 litres in the boot – was presented to the press in June 2009, and debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009.

When launched, petrol engine options included four Volkswagen Group sourced units; consisting of an entry-level 92 kilowatts (125 PS; 123 hp) 1.4 litre inline four cylinder (I4) TFSI (with a turbocharger and Fuel Stratified Injection), and a 1.8 litre I4 TFSI. The flagship 3.6 litre FSI VR6 engine (a detuned version of that fitted in the Passat R36) comes with four-wheel drive and six speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG). The Škoda Superb 3.6 FSI 4x4 has a top speed 250 km/h and acceleration of 0–100 km/h in 6.5 seconds.

Diesel engine options included 2.0 litre I4 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) with Pumpe-Düse injection which was rated at , 2.0 litre I4 TDI with common rail, and a 1.9 litre I4 TDI available also for the Greenline version with reduced fuel consumption.

In 2010, the engine range was updated. The car was now available with a 2.0 litre TFSI petrol four cylinder. Changes in diesel offer included two switches: two litre with Pumpe-Düse injection was replaced with common rail engine; the 1.9 litre PD unit was replaced with 1.6 litre common rail engine of the same power.

Transmissions include five and six speed manual gearboxes, and the popular automatic Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) with either six or seven speeds, as an option on almost all engine/trim combinations. In addition to the standard front-wheel-drive, the Superb and Superb Combi were both available with all-wheel-drive with a fourth generation Haldex clutch. The wheel sizes were a choice of 16, 17 and 18-inches.

Trim levels available in the majority of Europe were named the &#x27;Comfort&#x27;, &#x27;Ambition&#x27;, &#x27;Elegance&#x27;, &#x27;Greenline&#x27;, &#x27;Exclusive&#x27; and &#x27;Laurin &amp; Klement&#x27; (May 2012) – with Laurin &amp; Klement being top of the range. In the United Kingdom, the levels available were &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;SE&#x27;, &#x27;Elegance&#x27;, &#x27;Laurin &amp; Klement&#x27; and &#x27;Greenline&#x27;. In Sweden, an important market for Škoda, a version of the four-wheel-drive Superb Combi with off-road pretensions went on sale in June 2012. Analogous to the Subaru Outback and Volvo XC70 it was called the &quot;AllDrive.&quot; Based on the Elegance equipment level it features black plastic cladding around the lower parts of the car and around the wheelwells. Its ground clearance is also increased to the tune of and a front skid plate is added. In Sweden it was only available with the three different engines (one petrol, two diesels) and four-wheel-drive, but when the model was made available across Europe as the &quot;Škoda Superb Outdoor&quot; one month later (reaching the United Kingdom in October 2012) it was also available with front-wheel-drive, and most of the engine range.

For the Superb there is an extensive list of standard and extra equipment, including bi-xenon headlamps with AFS, front/rear proximity sensors, automatic park assist system, tyre pressure monitoring system, navigation system with large 6.5-inch colour touch screen display and 30 GB hard drive, television broadcast receiver, 12-speaker Sound System with Surround Sound (Amundsen, Bolero, Columbus), electrically adjustable seats and mirrors, rain sensor, sunroof with solar panels that allow circulation of air in parked car, front/rear heated seats, ventilated front seats upholstered in leather. For the Superb Combi a large tilt/slide two piece panoramic sunroof was an option.

In April 2013, Škoda unveiled a facelifted Superb in Shanghai. It was released for sale in the European market in June 2013. Updated exterior design features Škoda new design language elements. Headlights are fitted with integrated LED daylight running lights; diodes are standard for tail lights, too.

With the facelift, a combination of all wheel drive and DSG automatic transmission appeared on offer for the 125 kW two litre diesel engine. Starting from January 2014, design Outdoor package is available for the Superb Combi.

The list of features was slightly expanded too. The facelifted Superb received the latest generation of Automatic Parking Assistant. In addition to parallel parking (entering/exiting the parking space), the system is also capable of perpendicular parking (entering the parking space only).

From now on, the passengers in the rear seats can adjust the passenger seat from the back. The electrical control is located on the side of the passenger seat near the centre console and is thus easy to operate from the back. Passengers in the rear can move the front seat forward and back and adjust the seat height and angle.

<doc id="973665" wikidata="Q7605377" url="?curid=973665" title="Steam locomotives of British Railways">
<text>The steam locomotives of British Railways were used by British Railways over the period 1948–1968. The vast majority of these were inherited from its four constituent companies, the &quot;Big Four&quot;.

In addition, BR built 2,537 steam locomotives in the period 1948–1960, 1,538 to pre-nationalisation designs and 999 to its own standard designs. These locomotives had short working lives, some as little as five years, because of the decision to end the use of steam traction by 1968, against a design life of over 30 years and a theoretical final withdrawal date of between 1990 and 2000.

==Background==
British Railways was created on 1 January 1948 principally by the merger of the &quot;Big Four&quot; grouped railway companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR). It inherited a wide legacy of locomotives and rolling stock, much of which needed replacing due to the ravages of World War II.

==Locomotives inherited from constituent companies==
A wide variety of locomotives was acquired from the four major constituent companies. These had generally standardised their own designs. See:
* Locomotives of the Great Western Railway
*:specifically List of GWR locomotives as of 31 December 1947
* Locomotives of the Southern Railway
*:specifically List of Southern Railway locomotives as of 31 December 1947
* Locomotives of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway
*:specifically List of LMS locomotives as of 31 December 1947
* Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway
*:specifically List of LNER locomotives as of 31 December 1947

In addition, a handful of locomotives were inherited from minor constituents.

The 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials compared locomotives from each company against each other.

==Classification==
After initially using letter prefixes (E for ex-LNER, M for ex-LMS, S for ex-SR, and W for ex-GWR locomotives, as used for other inherited rolling stock), a numbering scheme was decided on in March 1948. Generally ex-GWR locomotives retained their numbers (and hence were able to retain their cast brass number plates) and it was decided to add 30000 to the Southern numbers, 40000 to the LMS numbers and 60000 to the LNER numbers. There were some exceptions though.

BR adopted a slightly modified version of the LMS classification system, itself based on the Midland Railway&#x27;s system. Each locomotive class was given a number 0–9 that signified its power, 0 for the least powerful and 9 for the most, with a suffix of F or P, indicating freight and passenger roles respectively. Freight power ranged from 0–9, passenger from 0–8. Many locomotives were used for both roles, in which case they were given two class numbers, the P-rating first e.g. 3P4F or 6P5F. A slight change from the LMS system saw those where the freight classification (&quot;x&quot;) equalled the passenger classification (also &quot;x&quot;) reclassified as &quot;x&quot;MT, MT standing for mixed-traffic, e.g. for the LMS Black Five locomotives, LMS 5P5F became BR 5MT. Mixed traffic locomotives had power in the range of classes 2–6.

==Locomotives acquired from the War Department==

In addition to the inherited and new-build locomotives, B.R. also purchased 620 locomotives of three types from the War Department. These had been in use on railways in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe during the Second World War. For two of these types, BR was adding to two classes it already had. BR had inherited 556 ex-LMS Stanier Class 8F 2-8-0s, and added 39 in 1949 and an additional three in 1957, bringing the class total to 666. Additionally, it had acquired 200 ex-LNER Class O7 2-8-0s of the WD Austerity 2-8-0 type, to which it added another 533 examples. 

The ex-LNER locomotives were later renumbered from the ex-LNER 6xxxx series into the BR series as 90000-90100, 90422-90520. The third type, of which it had no other examples, were the 25 of the WD Austerity 2-10-0s. Of the eight WD ex-LMS Fowler Class 3F 0-6-0Ts exported to France, the five survivors were repatriated in 1948, and resumed their original numbers in the sequence of LMS Fowler Class 3F locomotives (albeit with the additional 40000 that identified ex-LMS locomotives under BR ownership). The ex-WD Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0STs were ex-LNER Class J94 locomotives and are included in the total of LNER locomotives inherited.

==Locomotives built by BR to Big Four designs==
Initially, the newly nationalised network continued to be run as four different concerns, and pursued the policy of building of well-established designs. Some of these were already quite old, one class (the J72 tank engines) being a Pre-Grouping design. 

===GWR designs===

Great Western management was opposed to nationalisation and built many pannier tanks, resulting in a surplus of them. 452 locomotives were built to ex-GWR designs, of which 341 were pannier tanks.
===SR designs===
The SR designs built by BR included 50 Bulleid Pacifics. Many of these were later rebuilt in an un-streamlined form. BR also completed and steamed one of the experimental SR Leader class, but did not take it into stock, and cancelled the remaining orders in various states of completeness.

===LMS designs===
640 locomotives were built to LMS designs. They were built at various BR works, not just at the ex-LMS works at Crewe, Derby and Horwich. Many of the later BR standard designs were based on the LMS designs.


===LNER designs===

BR built 396 locomotives to LNER designs. The J72 Class was a North Eastern Railway design, dating from 1898.
&#x27;

==BR &#x27;Standard&#x27; classes==
From 1951, BR started to build steam locomotives to its own standard designs intended to succeed a disparate number of pre-grouping engines. They were largely based on LMS practice but incorporating ideas and modifications from the other constituent companies and America. Their design was overseen by Robert Riddles.

Characteristic features were taper boilers, high running plates, two cylinders and streamlined cabs.

Although more were ordered, 999 BR &quot;Standards&quot; were constructed: the last, 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, was built in 1960. Most never achieved their potential service life and were withdrawn in working order.

Riddles put his case for continuing to build steam locomotives in his presidential address to the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in November 1950. He compared capital costs to show that steam was cheaper than the alternatives, though he didn&#x27;t mention productivity differences, except to say fuel costs did not rank very high relative to total costs. For example, a Class 5 cost £16,000, compared to £78,100 for a 1,600 h. p. diesel, £138,700 for a gas turbine, or £37,400 for electric. He calculated the costs per drawbar horse power as £13 6s (steam), £65 (diesel), £69 7s (turbine) and £17 13s (electric). Riddles retired in 1953.

==Liveries==
Initially, BR decided upon blue for the largest passenger types, with GWR-style Brunswick green for passenger locomotives, and LNWR-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives. The blue however was quickly dropped and passenger livery for all locomotive classes reverted to green. Towards the end locomotives tended to be painted in lesser liveries, and often this was covered in a layer of grime.

Two logos (or crests) were used during the period. The first logo (1948–1956) was the &quot;Lion and Wheel&quot; (sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Cycling Lion&quot;), showing a lion standing over a spoked wheel upon which the words &quot;British Railways&quot; were displayed. The second logo (1956–1965) featured a lion &quot;holding&quot; a wheel (which gave rise to the nickname &quot;ferret and dartboard&quot;), sitting in a crown, with the words &quot;British&quot; and &quot;Railways&quot; to left and right. (Passenger stock and certain diesel locomotives used a roundel variant, where the words &quot;British Railways&quot; were in a ring surrounding the crest.) From 1965, the BR Corporate Image and &quot;Double Arrow&quot; logo was adopted, but this logo was not applied to steam locomotives (except on the Vale of Rheidol line).

Certain classes of steam locomotives were barred from working south of Crewe with effect from 1 September 1964 due to clearance issues with the new overhead electrification. Those locomotives affected had a broad yellow band painted diagonally across their cabsides to denote this prohibition.

==Withdrawal==
The 1955 Modernisation Plan called for the phasing out of steam traction. Major withdrawals occurred during 1962–1966, and steam traction ended in August 1968, coinciding with the Beeching Axe.


Some tank engines were sold to London Transport, where steam traction remained in use until 1971. Steam on industrial lines remained until the 1980s.

With regular maintenance, British steam locomotives typically lasted for approximately 30 years of intensive use, before major components would need to be replaced or overhauled. For a steam locomotive built in 1960, the economic lifespan would have led to it being withdrawn in the 1990s.

==Vale of Rheidol finale==
The locomotives of the Vale of Rheidol Railway, from the 2 ft narrow gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway (VoR) in Mid-Wales, had been inherited with the rest of the GWR stock in 1948. BR however continued to use steam locomotives on the line as a commercial heritage railway. This situation continued until 1989 when the line was privatised, and steam continued. These engines were the only steam locomotives to receive the Rail Blue with double arrow livery.

== Preservation ==
Withdrawn locomotives were sent for scrap to various locations around the United Kingdom, either to the railway workshops at Brighton in Sussex, Crewe in Cheshire, Darlington in County Durham, Doncaster in South Yorkshire and Swindon in Wiltshire, etc.; or to scrap metal merchants who had been approved to bid on the contracts – these included Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, which became a centre for the UK railway preservation movement.

Former main line locomotives, along with various smaller industrial shunters, form the backbone of steam motive power for heritage railways. Main line running on charter trains is possible and they run under TOPS code as Class 98.

=== Preserved Locomotives ===
Over 40 BR Standard Locomotives are preserved.
* BR Standard Class 9F/2-10-0 – 9 examples 
* BR Standard Class 8 (Duke) – 1 example
* BR Standard Class 7 (Britannia) – 2 examples
* BR Standard Class 5/5MT – 5 examples
* BR Standard Class 4/4-6-0 – 6 examples
* BR Standard Class 4/2-6-0 – 4 examples
* BR Standard Class 4 Tank – 15 examples
* BR Standard Class 2/2-6-0 – 3 examples (briefly there was a 4th)

== Contemporary replicas ==
In addition to the preserved ex-BR Standard Class locomotives, three new-build projects are currently underway.

=== 2MT 2-6-2T 84030 === 
On the Bluebell Railway, Barry scrapyard-condition 2MT 2-6-0 No.78059 is being used as the basis for a new built 2MT 2-6-2T, to be numbered 84030. None of the 78xxx class was ever allocated to, or regularly worked on, the Southern Region, so the decision was taken to convert this locomotive to the tank engine (2-6-2T) version, of which none now exist.

=== 3MT 2-6-2T 82045 ===
The 82045 Steam Locomotive Trust is part way through building a brand new example of the 3MT tank engine, currently under construction at Bridgnorth on the Severn Valley Railway.

=== 6MT 4-6-2 72010 Clan &#x27;Hengist&#x27; ===
The &#x27;Clan&#x27; Project is constructing a new-build 6MT 4-6-2, to be numbered No. 72010. Following the naming sequence planned by British Railways before the cancellation of the second batch of Clan class locomotives, the locomotive will be named &quot;Hengist&quot;. Final assembly of the locomotive is aimed to be completed at the Great Central Railway prior to career on both the mainline and heritage railways.
